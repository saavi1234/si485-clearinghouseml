    "summary": "<p>On January 28, 1992, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of residents at the W.A. Howe Developmental Center pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997 et seq. against the State of Illinois and W.A. Howe Developmental Center in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The DOJ alleged that the defendants deprived residents of the facility of their constitutional rights, privileges, and immunities and it sought injunctive relief.  </p><p>The DOJ specifically alleged that defendants subjected residents to unreasonable risks to their personal safety and undue bodily restraint by failing to provide appropriate individualized training and behavioral programs.  It was also alleged that the defendants provided inadequate medical care, kept inadequate record review systems, subjected residents to undue bodily restraint by failing to ensure restraints were administered by qualified professionals according to professional judgment, failed to prescribe and administer psychotropic medication safely and pursuant to professional judgment, and failed to employ adequate staff.</p><p>On January 4, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Judge Paul E. Plunkett) issued a consent decree.  The Court ordered that the defendants provide each resident a training program designed to reduce unreasonable risks to personal safety and unreasonable use of bodily restraints.  Defendants were also required to ensure that bodily restraints and time out were administered only pursuant to professional judgment.  Further, defendants were also required to provide adequate medical care and medical specialty services, ensure that prescription medications were appropriately prescribed and administered, establish and maintain adequate medical records for each resident, and employ adequate staff in ratios set forth in the consent decree.  </p><p>The Court anticipated that defendants would fully implement the provisions of the consent decree within two years.  The Court maintained jurisdiction over this action until all provision were fully implemented and appointed a panel of experts to monitor the defendants' compliance (the monitors appointed were psychology expert Johnny L. Matson, Ph.D., medical expert Robert B. Kugel, M.D., and physical management expert Karen M. Green-McGowan).  The docket ends on February 14, 1996 with the Court (Judge Plunkett) entering a minute order granting the Agreed Motion to Terminate Consent Decree and Dismiss Case.</p><p></p>",

A. Howe\nDevelopmental Center. 42 U.S.C. Section  !997b(a)(1)\nDear Governor Thompson:\nBy letter dated April 18, 1986, we informed you that,\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(ฦ'the Act\"), 42 U.S.C. Section 1997, the Civil Rights Division\nof the United States Department of Justice was commencing an\ninvestigation into conditions at the W. A. Howe Developmental\nCenter  (\"Howe\"), Tihley Park, Illinois.  On May 19, 1988, we\nprovided you with an interim report regarding the status of this\ninvestigation.  As specified in the Act, we are now writing to\ninform you that further review confirms that unconstitutional\nconditions exist at Howe, and also to advise you of the minimum\nmeasures we believe are required to be taken by the State in\norder to remedy those conditions.\nOur investigation consisted, first, of several comprehensive\ntours of Howe by independent experts, most recently between\nFebruary 15 and 17, 1989. The experts observed conditions in all\nthe residential buildings at Howe at various times of the day,\nformally and informally interviewed administrators, staff and\nresidents, and examined a variety of records.  Further, we con-\nducted interviews with members of advocacy and consumer groups\nand other persons with responsibilities for the welfare of\nresidents in Illinois developmental centers.  Finally, we\ngathered and analyzed extensive documentation related to Howe,\nwhich included: a variety of policies and procedures governing\nthe operation of Howe; information related to Howe's staffing\npatterns; minutes from Howe's Committees; police reports; abuse\ninvestigation reports  (available for inspection only);  mortality\nreviews and list of deaths; monthly injury reports; restraint\nlogs; lists of patients on medication; logs of patients placed in\n\n- 2 -\n\"quiet training\" rooms; and a sampling of residents' records.  We\nโขalso have reviewed the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of\nCorrection resulting from a survey conducted by the Health Care\nFinancing Administration in March 1988 and other documents\nrelated thereto.  During our investigation we were treated\ngraciously by Howe administration and staff, and attorneys from\nthe Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities.\nBased upon our extensive investigation, we believe that\nconditions exist at Howe which deprive residents of their consti-\ntutional rights.  The United States Supreme Court has clearly\nstated that institutionalized mentally retarded persons have a\nconstitutional right to adequate medical care, reasonable safety,\nand such training as an appropriate professional would consider\nreasonable to ensure safety and freedom from undue bodily\nrestraint.  Youngberg v. Romeo  457 U.S. 307, 324  (1982) .\nf\nSet forth below are our findings and recommendations.  These\nfindings and recommendations relate to the State subjecting\nresidents of Howe to conditions that violate their constitutional\nrights, including conditions that seriously threaten the health\nand safety of Howe residents.  These unconstitutional conditions\ninclude:\n1.  Failure to provide sufficient training to residents\nto avoid undue risks to their personal safety and\nunreasonable use of bodily restraints.\n2.  Failure to provide adequate medical care.\n3.  Failure to provide sufficient numbers of appropriately\ntrained staff to render professional judgments regarding\nnecessary care, training, medical treatment, and to\nimplement such professional judgments.\n4.  Failure to adequately protect residents from physical\ninjury.\n5.  Failure to keep and maintain such records as will allow\nstaff to render professional judgments regarding care\nand treatment of residents.\nThe facts supporting our conclusions include the following:\nInadequate Training Programs\nHowe fails to provide professionally designed and\nimplemented training programs sufficient to ensure that residents\nare not subjected to unreasonable risks to their personal safety\nand undue bodily restraint.  At the time of the most recent tour,\nthere were five Masters level psychologists working at the\nfacility with 721 residents, resulting in a ratio of 1:144.  Our\n\n- 3 -\nconsultant regarded this ratio as inadequate to serve the needs\nof the Howe population, particularly since many of the Howe\nresidents are severely disabled, exhibit severe and sometimes\ndangerous behavior, and live in close proximity to each other.\nIndeed, our consultant found the number of treatment staff to\nbe so inadequate as to place residents at extreme risk of\ninjury.  Several of the Howe staff psychologists agreed that\nthe psychology staff is not adequate.  They stated that there\nwere insufficient numbers of their profession to provide\nprofessionally designed training programs for residents,\nincluding residents exhibiting severe and dangerous behavior.\nAs a result of an inadequate number of qualified\npsychologists, available staff rely on the same or similar\n\"stock\" behavioral programs for residents irrespective of the\nindividual needs of those residents.  This reliance constitutes\na substantial departure from accepted professional judgment and\nplaces residents at great risk of harm.  Our consultant concluded\nthat the failure to professionally evaluate resident need and\nindividualize training programs ostensibly designed to reduce or\neliminate aggressive, self-injurious, and other dangerous\nbehaviors will, however inadvertently, produce worse behavior.\nTo control resident behavior, in lieu of professionally designed\ntraining programs, staff resort to chemical and physical\nrestraints โ  in violation of the constitutional rights of Howe's\nresidents.  Indeed, when physical restraints are employed,\nincluding use of time out, such procedures are not consistently\nmonitored and evaluated by qualified professional staff.\nTo the extent \"training programs\" have been developed, such\n\"programs\" are not consistently implemented by direct care staff\nassigned to do so.  Some staff who are responsible for residents\nwho exhibit self-injurious behavior did not know the specific\ntraining programs developed for those residents.  In this regard,\nrecords, including behavior management plans, were locked\nand unavailable to staff in some units.  Our consultant found\nthat data ostensibly resulting from implementation of behavior\nprograms is not recorded contemporaneously with the observed\nbehavior and are not otherwise properly maintained.  Such data\nare not regarded as reliable either by our consultant or Howe\npsychology staff, and, consequently, are not an adequate basis on\nwhich professional decisions can be based.  This is due, in part,\nto the inadequate level of direct care staffing in the units and\nother factors including the lack of appropriately trained direct\ncare staff.\nIn sum, activities at Howe characterized by Howe staff to\nconstitute \"training programs\" represent substantial departures\nfrom accepted professional judgment.  Regrettably, our consultant\nconcluded that these activities may expose residents to undue\nrisks to their personal safety.\n\n- 4 -\nInadequate Medical Care\nHowe does not have adequate psychiatric, nursing, physical\ntherapy, occupational therapy and other specialized medical\nservices to adequately meet the needs of its residents.  The\nabsence of necessary staff results in inadequate medical care.\nAn estimated 15 per cent of the residents at Howe are\nreceiving neuroleptic medication; 24 per cent are receiving\npsychotropic medication, and many are receiving anticonvul-\nsant medication.  Many residents are on multiple psychotropic\nmedications.  Such drugs, when prescribed and used without the\nexercise of continuing clinical medical judgment, can cause\nirreparable physical harm.  Notwithstanding the need for close\nsupervision and monitoring of such drugs by a psychiatrist, a\npsychiatrist is available at Howe only four hours each week.\nOur consultant found such psychiatric coverage to be \"grossly\ninadequate..\"\nThe number of registered nurses  (RNs) available to provide\nnecessary care to Howe's residents is likewise inadequate.  From\n5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., no RN is on duty.  From 11:00 p.m. to\n7:00 a.m., one RN is responsible for all medical care for all\n720 residents at the facility.  This means that one nurse must\nhandle all medical emergencies, treat injuries as they occur, and\nmaintain medical surveillance of residents with complex medical\nneeds.  The number of RNs available at Howe is grossly inadequate\nand exposes residents to unreasonable risks to their personal\nsafety.\nNo orthopedist is available as a consultant to Howe on\na regular basis.  Given that approximately 1/4 to 1/3โขof\nindividuals with developmental disabilities and mental retar-\ndation have orthopedic deformities and that Howe has a unit\nspecifically for the care of individuals with severe multiple\nhandicapping conditions predominantly of a musculo-skeltal\nnature, this is inadequate.  The lack.of adequate orthopedic\nconsultation has led to a failure to provide treatment where\nmedically indicated, to a failure to prevent progression of\ndeformities, and to needless suffering on the part of residents.\nMoreover, the physical and occupational therapy staff is simply\ninadequate to serve the large number of residents with orthopedic\ndeformities.\nA neurologist is available at Howe for only four hours each\nmonth.  Such neurological consultation is not adequate to serve\nthe needs of the approximately 240 residents with serious seizure\ndisorders on multiple seizure medications.\nWhile our consultant found the number of physicians to be\nadequate, records indicated that they are not available to\n\n- 5 -\nrender professional medical judgments at critical junctures in\nthe delivery of medical care at the facility.  None is present\nat the facility from 11:00 p.m. to 8:30 a.m.  Our consultant\nconcluded that the absence of physician coverage during this time\nplaces residents at risk.  Such risk is exacerbated by the\nabsence of adequate RN coverage.  In addition, our consultant\nfound inadequate involvement by physicians in resident medical\ncare even when they were available at the facility.\nDue to the lack of adequate medical supervision of patients,\nearly signs of illness and disease go undetected and/or\nuntreated.  For example, staff at Howe refer residents with\nscoliosis to an orthopedist only after the scoliosis becomes\nsevere.  Thus, the resident's condition is allowed to deteriorate\nwithout any attempt at prevention or treatment.\nOur consultant physician found that progress notes do not\nconsistently reflect the resident's condition, nor reflect the\nresults of important laboratory tests or medical specialty\nreports.  Moreover, an appropriate and current medical problems\nlist was missing from the medical records reviewed.  Our\nconsultant physician also found that physicians' annual reviews\nare significantly incomplete.  The absence of critical\ninformation in the medical charts of Howe residents subjects them\nto an increased risk of harm from inappropriate treatment.\nIn addition, psychotropic medication appears to be over used\nand misused at Howe.  Our consultant physician found these drugs\nare sometimes prescribed at Howe without any justification being\nnoted in the record and that physicians do not adequately assess\nthe continued need for such medications.  Our consultant\npsychologist likewise found that the resident records disclose\nlittle or no specific evidence that there was consideration of\nall salient factors of an individual case before the medication\nwas prescribed.  Instances were found where residents failed to\nexhibit significant episodes of maladaptive behavior but their\nmedication dosages were maintained nonetheless.  Records examined\nfailed to document justification for the maintenance or altera-\ntion of dosages.  Moreover, to the extent the underlying\nbehavioral documentation is unreliable, a fact our consultant\npsychologist found at Howe, residents are placed at clear risk of\nsignificant side effects of medication, failures in treatment,\nand maintenance of chemical regimens which may be unnecessary and\nexpose residents to unreasonable risks to their personal safety.\nFinally, our physician consultant found emergency medical\nservices inadequate.  Records indicate that emergency equipment\nis not fully operational on a consistent basis or, in some cases,\navailable at all.  The deaths of two residents transferred by\nHowe to community hospital for emergency medical care calls into\nquestion the viability of the state's current procedures for the\nprovision of emergency and acute medical care for residents.\n\nJ -/ โขโข--\n- 6 -\nAn emergency medical care system which fails to make timely\ntransfers, ensure continuity of care, and fails to provide\nnecessary medical information regarding the referred patients  โ\nwith death resulting โ  is clearly inadequate.\nInadequate Numbers of and Insufficiently Trained Direct Care\nStaff\nOur consultant concluded that inadequate numbers of staff,\nlack of properly trained staff, and inadequate oversight has led\ndirectly to situations which placed residents in physical danger,\nand in which actual harm has been inflicted.  The physical\nconfiguration of the living areas is such that the two direct\ncare staff assigned to each living unit cannot keep all residents\nin sight.  Given the aggressive behavior of some of these\nresidents and the fact that many exits are not alarmed to alert\nstaff if a resident leaves, the lack of sufficient staff to\nsupervise residents results in undue risk to their safety.\nFurther, most residents require assistance in bathing and\ndressing and tending to other personal needs.  The two direct\ncare staff assigned to the 10 residents of each living unit are\ninadequate to provide these essential services and provide\nnecessary training as well, particularly where, as here, some\ndirect care staff are performing routine housekeeping functions.\nThe failure to ensure adequate numbers of direct care staff\nsubjects residents to undue risk of harm from injury.\nThe gravity of this situation is conveyed by the incidents\nof injury at Howe.  Based on the information available to us, we\ncalculate the average number of injuries per month at Howe\nincreased dramatically from 1986 through 1988.  There was a five\nper cent increase from calendar 1986 to calendar 1987  (i.e., from\nan average of 3 67 to 3 87 injuries per month), and an increase of\nanother 14 per cent from 1987 to 1988 (i.e.. from 387 to 442\ninjuries per month).  That is an overall increase of. 20 per cent\nin just two years  (i.e.. from an average of 367 to 442 per\nmonth).  This increase is all the more substantial when one\nconsiders that during this time the resident population at Howe\ndeclined.\nIn addition to the increasing number of injuries at Howe,\nthe nature of several specific serious incidents which have\noccurred illustrate the fact that staff at Howe do not protect\nresidents from harm.  For example, in March 1988 a resident was\nfound dead on the floor of her room at 6:15 a.m., with signs of\nlividity indicating she has been dead for some time.  It was\nsubsequently determined that direct care staff failed to perform\nroutine bed checks during the night.  In the same month, another\nresident was found hanging over the side of her bed, strangled\nto death by a posey bed restraint which had been incorrectly\napplied.  An autopsy disclosed that this resident's sternun had\nbeen broken during attempts at cardiopulmonary  resuscitation\n\n,'ยฏ.ยฏ::-`.\n- 7 -\n(CPR).  The staff person who had performed chest compression  on\nthe resident had received no CPR training after she was hired  in\n1982.  A subsequent investigation disclosed that staff  training\nin the use of the posey device had concentrated on wheelchair\napplication and neglected bed application entirely.  In  another\nincident occurring shortly before our tour, a resident ran  from\nthe front door of her living unit to the street and was killed by\na passing automobile.  At the time the resident left her  living\nunit   one of the two direct care staff assigned to supervise her\nฦ\nand other residents was at lunch, and the other staff person was\nwriting  in a log book.  In sum, direct care staff is  insufficient\nboth in numbers and qualifications to protect residents  from\nunreasonable risks to their personal  safety.\nMinimally Necessary  Remedies\nThe administration and staff at Howe appear committed  to\nproviding residents with appropriate care in a safe environment.\nHowever, the aforementioned  subjects Howe residents to  egregious\nor flagrant conditions that deprive them of their  constitutional\nrights pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the\nfull enjoyment of these rights.  To rectify the deficiencies  at\nHowe, and ensure that constitutionally adequate conditions  are\nmaintained thereafter, we propose to enter into an agreement with\nthe State of Illinois which shall be entered as an order of a\nFederal Court and which shall provide, at a minimum, that Howe\nshall implement the following remedies:\n1)  Professionally design and implement training  programs\nsufficient to eliminate unreasonable risks to personal  safety\nand undue bodily restraint.  Such procedures should  include\nimprovements  in the current tracking and recordkeeping systems to\nmonitor the effectiveness of behavior management programs  and\nallow programs to be re-evaluated  and revised, as appropriate;\n2)  Increase professional and direct care staff  necessary\nto afford adequate medical care, to provide that degree  of\ntraining necessary to meet constitutional  standards, and\nsubstantially  reduce the high incidence of physical injuries  at\nHowe ;\n3)  Improve drug practices to ensure monitoring by  qualified\nprofessionals consistent with exercise of professional  judgment;\n4)  Improve and expand training programs and  opportunities\nfor professional  and direct care staff to ensure the exercise  of\nprofessional judgment with respect to care and training  of\nresidents;\n5)  Improve recordkeeping procedures to ensure  necessary\ninformation  is available to enable professionals to make\nprofessional  judgments regarding  resident care and training.\n\n/โข'*โขโขโข?:\n- 8 -\nInformation about federal financial assistance which may be\navailable to assist with the remedial process can be obtained by\ncontacting Mr. Hiroshi Kanno, Acting Director, Region V,\nDepartment of Health and Human Services at (312) 353-5132 and\nfrom the Department of Education by contacting the individuals\nlisted in the enclosed information guide.\nOur attorneys will be contacting counsel for the Illinois\nDepartment of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities\nshortly to arrange a meeting to discuss this matter in greater\ndetail.

Thompson\nGovernor\nState of Illinois\nState Capitol Building\nMR-IL-002-002\nSpringfield, Illinois  62706\nRe: Investigation of Hove Developmental  Center\nDear Governor Thompson:\nI am writing in reference to this Department's continuing\ninvestigation of Howe Developmental Center pursuant to the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997.\nBy letter dated April 18, 1986, we informed you of our\nintent to investigate Howe Developmental Center.  Since that\ntime attorneys from our office, accompanied by expert consul-\ntants, have toured the facility on several occasions.  On each\nvisit we received the full cooperation of the staff at Howe.  We\nappreciate their assistance and willingness to provide any\nmaterials our consultants requested.\nDuring our investigation, Howe Developmental Center has\nundergone many changes in personnel and management structure.  At\nthe time of our last visit, a new director was in place and many\npersonnel had been assigned new duties.  In light of these\nchanges and the initiation of yet to be completed improvements in\nthe operation of the facility, we will defer making a judgment\nregarding the adequacy of the facility's overall program of care\nand training for Howe's residents. Recognizing the State's\nefforts to change and improve conditions at Howe, we have\ndetermined that it is appropriate to allow responsible state\nofficials and staff at Howe a short additional period of time to\ncompletely address the areas of concern - abuse and neglect of\nresidents by staff, adequacy of staff, and environmental  safety\nand sanitation - before reaching a conclusion as to the adequacy\nof conditions at the facility when judged by the applicable\nconstitutional standard.  Accordingly, we will return to Howe\nwith appropriate consultants to assess conditions in approxi-\nmately six months.\n\n- 2 -\nI look forward to continued cooperation between our offices\nas we work to ensure constitutional conditions for residents at\nHowe\" Developmental Center.

      "title": "Re: Investigation of the Clyde L. Choate Developmental Center, Anna, Illinois",
      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - RFK \nWashington, DC  20530 \nNovember 9, 2009 \nThe Honorable Pat Quinn \nGovernor \nOffice of the Governor \n207 State House \nSpringfield, Illinois  62706 \nRe:\t  Investigation of the Clyde L. Choate Developmental Center, \nAnna, Illinois \nDear Governor Quinn: \nI am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights Divisionโs investigation\nof conditions and practices at the Clyde L. Choate Developmental Center (โChoateโ),\nin Anna, Illinois.  On February 27, 2007, we notified then Governor Blagojevich of\nour intent to conduct an investigation of Choate pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (โCRIPAโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997.  CRIPA gives the\nDepartment of Justice authority to seek remedies for any pattern or practice of\nconduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities who are served in public institutions. \nOn July 23-26 and September 17-20, 2007, we conducted an on-site review of\ncare and treatment at Choate with expert consultants in various disciplines. \nDuring our visits, we interviewed Choate administrators, professionals, staff, and\nconsultants, and visited residents in their residences, at activity areas, and during\nmeals.  Before, during, and after our site visits, we reviewed a wide variety of\nrelevant State and facility documents, including policies and procedures, incident\nreports and investigations, and medical and other records relating to the care and\ntreatment of Choate residents.  In keeping with our pledge of transparency and to\nprovide technical assistance, where appropriate, we conveyed our preliminary\nfindings to State counsel and to certain State and facility administrators and staff\nduring exit briefings at the close of our on-site visits. \nWe would like to express our appreciation to Choate administrators,\nprofessionals, and staff and to the State officials who participated in our visit for\ntheir assistance, cooperation, professionalism, and courtesy throughout our \n\n- 2 -\ninvestigation.  We hope to continue to work with the State and Choate officials in\nthe same cooperative manner going forward. \nIn accordance with statutory requirements, we now write to advise you\nformally of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the\nminimum remedial steps that are necessary to remedy the deficiencies set forth\nbelow.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997b(a).  In doing so, we note that many of the findings we\nmake in this letter are due to or exacerbated by Choateโs failure to focus its\ntreatment and care on moving individuals into the most integrated settings\nappropriate to their needs in violation of Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999),\nincluding failures in:  (A) behavioral, intellectual, communication, and psychiatric\nassessments; (B) behavioral interventions; (C) treatment planning; and\n(D) habilitation, communication, and special education programs and services.\nThese deficiencies place individuals at greater risk of injuries related to their or\nothersโ maladaptive behaviors and make restrictions on their liberty due to use of\nseclusion or restraint more likely, undermining the treatment provided at Choate\nand potentially leading to prolonged institutionalization. \nBased upon our investigation, we have concluded that certain conditions and\npractices at Choate violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of its\nresidents.  In particular, we find that Choate fails to provide its residents with \nadequate:  (A) transition planning and placement in the most integrated setting;\n(B) protection from harm; (C) health care, including psychiatric care and physical\nand nutritional management; (D) behavioral, habilitation, and communication\nservices; (E) special education services; and (F) integrated treatment planning.  See \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982);\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483, Subpart I\n(Medicaid Program Provisions); Americans with Disabilities Act (โADAโ), 42 U.S.C.\nยงยง 12101, 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130(d); Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (โIDEAโ), 20 U.S.C. ยง 1401 et seq.; and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794. \nDespite these deficiencies, we wish to note several positive aspects of the care\nthat Choate provides to its residents.  Choateโs grounds and buildings are well kept,\nand the living units are clean and presentable.  Beyond these aesthetics, we also\nfound that many of the staff members we interacted with showed genuine care and\nrespect for Choateโs residents, and we were impressed with clinical abilities of many\nof Choateโs medical professionals, including the Director of Nursing and the Medical\nDirector.  Likewise, the forensic unit at Choate is impressive in many respects,\nparticularly in its focus on habilitating its forensic residents so that they can move\nas expeditiously as possible to less restrictive settings appropriate to their needs. \n\n- 3 -\nNevertheless, two significant concerns underlie many of the findings we set\nforth in this letter.  First, we found a critical lack of oversight and supervision\npervading most aspects of the care and treatment provided at Choate.  This derived, \nin part, from vacancies in certain key positions.  More fundamentally, however, we\nfound that Choate is not collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing information\nadequately so that its administrative and clinical leadership can accurately\ndetermine whether Choateโs residents are safe, whether their needs are being met,\nand whether the treatment and habilitation provided at Choate are effective.  The \nfailure to collect and analyze information adequately has also undermined Choateโs\nability to integrate information across disciplines and provide coordinated and\ncollaborative care.  These failures have led to substantial constitutional violations. \nSecond, we noted a profound inattentiveness to Olmsteadโs requirement of\nplacing residents at Choate in the most integrated setting consistent with their\nneeds.  Generally accepted professional standards and federal law require that the\ntreatment of individuals with developmental disabilities be focused on the\ndevelopment of skills and abilities that aid those individuals in overcoming their\npersonal barriers to living as independently as possible.  Thus, a focus on helping\nindividuals move to live successfully in more integrated settings should underlie all\naspects of the care and treatment provided at Choate.  Unfortunately, unlike\nChoateโs forensic unit where movement to more integrated settings appears to be\nemphasized, we found that this emphasis did not characterize the provision of\ntreatment at Choate generally.  As previously noted, many of the findings we make\nin this letter are aggravated by Choateโs failure to focus its treatment and care on\nmoving individuals into the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nLocated in Anna, Illinois, approximately 105 miles outside of St. Louis,\nMissouri, Choate is a licensed 200-bed intermediate care facility for individuals\nwith developmental disabilities.  Choate is one of nine residential developmental\ncenters operated by the Illinois Department of Human Services (โDHSโ).  Choate \nalso operates the Stateโs only forensic unit for individuals with developmental\ndisabilities, which has a total bed capacity of 30 residents.  At the time of our visits \nin July and September 2007, Choate housed approximately 175 residents.  In \naddition, DHS operates a psychiatric hospital on the Choate campus, but that\nhospital was not included in our review. \n\n- 4 -\nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  Choateโs Transition and Discharge Planning Is Inadequate \nChoate fails to provide transition and discharge planning consistent with\nfederal law.  This failure to provide adequate transition and discharge planning was\nmade evident when we requested a โlist of all residents with community placement\ngoalsโ during our visit, and we were provided a list that only included the names of\nsix individuals out of the 175 individuals residing at Choate.  Moreover, the \nmonthly review meetings we attended and the monthly review summaries we\nreviewed included virtually no discussion of discharge planning, and when they did\ndiscuss it, they cited inappropriate barriers to discharge, such as weight\nmanagement and management of diabetes, neither of which prevent community\nplacement.  The failure to provide adequate discharge planning deprives the\nindividuals confined at Choate of their rights under Olmstead.  The Stateโs failure \nto comply with Olmstead also contributes significantly to the constitutional\nviolations we identify in the remainder of this letter. \nFederal law requires that Choate actively pursue the timely discharge of\nresidents to the most integrated, appropriate setting that is consistent with the\nresidentsโ needs.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  Thus, at the time of admission and \nthroughout a residentโs stay, Choate should:  (1) identify, through professional\nassessments, the factors that likely will foster viable discharge for the resident; and\n(2) use these factors to drive treatment planning, habilitation, and intervention. \nWithout clear and purposeful identification of such factors, residents will be denied\nhabilitation and other services and supports that will help them acquire, develop,\nand/or enhance the skills necessary to function in a community setting. \nThe Choate discharge planning process substantially deviates from generally\naccepted professional standards and federal law.  The inadequacies in Choateโs\ndischarge planning process are intertwined with the other deficiencies in the care\nand treatment provided at Choate:  the failures in other disciplines undermine\nChoateโs ability to place individuals in the most integrated setting, while the failure\nto move individuals to the most integrated setting consistent with their needs is a\nfundamental cause of the constitutional violations in the care and treatment \nprovided at Choate.  As discussed in further detail in Section II.D.1.a, infra, \nChoateโs behavioral, intellectual, and communication assessments are inadequate,\nundermining Choateโs ability to determine the strengths and needs of individuals so\nthey can be placed in the community.  Choate does not appear to be performing\nthese assessments on a timely basis, nor does it appear to be focused on\ndetermining the barriers to returning the individual to a community setting. \n\n- 5 -\n\nRelatedly, Choateโs psychiatric assessments, diagnoses, and monitoring of\npsychotropic medications are inadequate, suggesting that the use of these\nmedications may be counter-therapeutic in some instances, as discussed in further\ndetail in Section II.C.2.  In particular, the failure to attempt to determine minimally\neffective dosages suggests that individuals may be receiving inappropriately high\ndosages of medications that are being used to restrain, rather than treat,\nmaladaptive behaviors, and that inhibit the ability to treat the maladaptive\nbehavior through appropriate behavioral interventions.  The unjustified use of\npsychotropic medications can significantly impair the other treatment and\nhabilitation provided at Choate, and hinder an individualโs ability to move to a\nmore integrated setting. \nBecause Choate fails to provide adequate behavioral, intellectual,\ncommunication, and psychiatric assessments, the behavioral interventions based on\nthose assessments are inadequate as discussed in further detail in Section II.D.1.b,\nand the interventions do not assist individuals in developing the skills they need to\nbe able to live in a more integrated setting.  Indeed, as discussed in further detail in \nSection II.D.1.b, we found many instances where individuals were receiving\ninappropriate or insufficient behavioral interventions, including multiple examples\nwhere individuals had been identified as having significant maladaptive behaviors\nbut were not receiving any structured behavioral interventions.  The failure to \nimplement timely and appropriate behavioral interventions often leads to\nregression in the functional abilities necessary to live in a more integrated setting\nand, as discussed in further detail in Section II.B.3, may lead to further restrictions\non an individualโs liberty, including seclusion and restraint.  Further, the failure to \nimplement appropriate behavioral interventions places these individuals at risk of\ninjuries related to their or othersโ maladaptive behaviors, which may hinder their\ntreatment at Choate and lead to prolonged institutionalization. \nMoreover, we found that the habilitation programs at Choate do not meet\nconstitutional standards as discussed in further detail in Section II.D.2.  Choateโs \nprovision of continuous active treatment is infrequent and is not designed to meet\nthe habilitation needs of the individuals residing at Choate adequately.  Relatedly,\nin our review of the Personal Service Plans (โPSPโ) at Choate, as discussed in\nfurther detail in Sections II.D.2 and II.F.1, infra, we found that they lacked any\nsection devoted to discharge planning.  Treatment of individuals at Choate should \nbe focused on the barriers to community placement and the provision of skills to\novercome those barriers.  Therefore, while Choate does identify some barriers to\ncommunity placement in the PSPs, the PSPs do not list specific plans to address\nthose barriers.  Relatedly, the monthly review meetings of the treatment teams do\nnot routinely address discharge planning and barriers to placement.  The failure to \nfocus treatment planning, habilitation, and interventions on enabling the individual \n\n- 6 -\nto return to the community is a substantial departure from generally accepted\nprofessional standards and the requirements of Olmstead. \nWe also found that Choateโs provision of communication services, including\nspeech and language programming and services for individuals with hearing\nimpairments, did not meet generally accepted professional standards, as discussed\nin further detail in Section II.D.3.  The development of communication skills greatly\nfacilitates movement toward more integrated settings for individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, as it is these skills that enable them to communicate\ntheir needs and concerns and to avoid engaging in maladaptive behavior that may\nlead to prolonged institutionalization.  Effective communication skills enable the \nindividual to become less dependent on others for their basic needs, including\nmedical care, and to access essential services at the time of their choosing, which\nare required for living in less restrictive settings. \nFinally, Choateโs failure to provide adequate special education services\nhinders individualsโ ability to live in more integrated settings, as discussed in\nfurther detail in Section II.E.  Education is both an aspect of living in the most\nintegrated setting and an essential means of obtaining the skills necessary to live in\nsuch a setting.  Individuals residing at Choate have a right to special education\nservices under federal law, and the failure to provide those services impairs their\nability to participate and integrate into more integrated settings. \nB.  Choate Does Not Adequately Protect Individuals From Harm \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that persons with developmental\ndisabilities who reside in state-operated institutions have a โconstitutionally\nprotected liberty interest in safety.โ  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 318.  Therefore, as the \nCourt explained, the state โhas the unquestioned duty to provide reasonable safety\nfor all residentsโ within the institution.  Id. at 324.  In our judgment, Choate fails to\nprovide a living environment that complies with this constitutional mandate. \nChoate does not adequately protect its residents from harm and risk of harm\nand does not provide its residents with a reasonably safe living environment.\nSpecifically, individuals residing at Choate are subject to repeated injuries of\nsimilar nature, unchecked self-injurious behavior, abuse, and neglect.  The harm \nChoate residents experience as a result of these deficiencies is multi-faceted and\nincludes physical injury; psychological harm; excessive and inappropriate use of\nrestraints; and inadequate, ineffective, and counterproductive treatment.  This \nharm undermines the other care and treatment provided at Choate, prolongs the\ntime period spent by individuals in the institution, and delays the movement of\nindividuals to more integrated settings in violation of Olmstead.  The facilityโs \n\n- 7 -\nability to address this harm is hampered by inadequate incident, risk, and quality\nmanagement and deficient investigative practices. \n1.  Incident and Risk Management Is Inadequate \nChoateโs incident and risk management systems are inadequate to protect its\nresidents from harm.  To ensure that residentsโ constitutional right to safety is\nprotected, generally accepted professional standards require that residential\ndevelopmental disability facilities maintain an incident and risk management\nsystem that seeks to prevent incidents and requires appropriate corrective action\nwhen incidents do occur.  Effective incident and risk management depends on:  \n(1) accurate data collection and reporting; (2) thorough investigations;\n(3) identification of actual or potential risks of harm, including the tracking and\ntrending of data; and (4) implementation and monitoring of effective corrective\nand/or preventive actions.  The incident and risk management system at Choate\nfalls significantly short of these standards and, as a result, residents are exposed to\nactual and potential harm. \na.  Incident Reporting Is Deficient \nOur review of Choateโs incident reporting process found significant\ndeficiencies resulting in substantial underreporting of incidents, events, and risks\nthat affect the health and safety of residents at Choate.  These deficiencies are \ncaused by a procedural and policy failure to require that all incidents are reported\nto quality assurance personnel, as well as a lack of understanding of incident\nreporting guidelines by Choate staff. \nFirst, according to policy, Choate only collects and analyzes incident data\nwhen an injury occurs.  Choate limits incident types to accidents, peer-to-peer\naggression, self-injurious behaviors, and injuries of an unknown origin.  Therefore, \nfor an incident to be included in an individualโs data, and thus in the facilityโs\naggregate data, an individual must have been harmed to such an extent that an\nInjury Report was warranted.  The failure to include incidents that do not include \nan injury precludes Choate from being able to conduct analyses before an injury\noccurs, anticipate potential areas of harm, and take corrective action.  To the extent \nthat Choateโs incident reporting policies only require incidents that result in injury\nto be reported, they substantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards and promote constitutional violations. \nSecond, during our tour of Choate, we also found a lack of staff awareness\nabout the current incident reporting policy.  We were initially advised that the\nincident reporting policy had either just been revised or was under revision, but\nnevertheless all staff had been trained on the new policy and were expected to \n\n- 8 -\nimplement it.  When we requested a copy of the policy, we were informed that the\npolicy was not yet available.  During our tour of the facility, however, a unit director\nindicated that a policy notebook had just recently been provided, but it was kept in\nthe unit directorโs office, not on the unit.  According to the unit director, training on\nthe new policy was to begin the following week.  When asked about the contents of \nthe new policy notebook, the unit director indicated that he had not yet reviewed it.\nThe level of confusion regarding incident reporting suggests that incident reporting\nis not being performed uniformly, casting considerable doubt on the reliability of the\ndata collected in these reports. \nOur review of Choateโs incident report data in conjunction with individualsโ\nclinical records, external notification reports, and similar sources indicated that the\nincident reporting data were unreliable.  A significant number of incidents and\ninjuries are not being received and reported in the facilityโs aggregate data used for\ntracking and trending.1  For example, the following incidents were found in clinical\nrecords or external notification reports, but were not included in an individualโs or\nthe facilityโs aggregate data: \nโข\t  On April 3, 2007, an individual complained of ear pain and a plastic\nobject was discovered in the ear canal, requiring removal by an Ear,\nNose, and Throat Specialist; \nโข\t  On April 6, 2007, an individual fell and sustained two lacerations to\nhis forehead that required sutures; \nโข\t  On July 11, 2007, a residentโs lip was lacerated after being punched by\nanother resident; and \nโข\t  On July 17, 2007, a resident threw a chair at a peer, hitting him in the\nface, and first aid was necessary. \n1  We also found that Choateโs aggregate data on restraint usage is not an\naccurate reflection of actual restraint use at the facility.  For example, we were\nprovided with a report purporting to show restraint usage by person from\nJanuary 1, 2006 through July 26, 2007, but we found a number restraints\ndocumented elsewhere in facility records that were not included in this report. \n\n- 9 -\nOver time, the failure to properly report all incidents is even more troubling,\nas demonstrated by the following examples: \nโข\t  Between April 1, 2007, and July 23, 2007, an individual was reportedly\ninjured on three occasions, but a thorough record review revealed\ninjuries on at least eleven separate occasions; and \nโข\t  Between April 1, 2007, and July 23, 2007, according to the report data,\na resident only had one incident of โattempted pica,โ2 while other \nrecords, including radiology reports and three internal investigations\ninto alleged neglect, revealed that the resident had successfully\ningested a necklace on May 20, 2007, and a metal screw on\nMay 21, 2007.  In several other instances recorded in progress notes,\nthe resident threatened pica behavior, and in one instance punched a\nstaff member in the mouth when the staff member attempted to\nredirect him.  None of these โthreatening picaโ incidents was recorded\nin his behavioral tracking data. \nChoateโs failure to properly report these incidents jeopardizes its ability to\nidentify potential risks of harm and institute appropriate intervention strategies. \nIndeed, in the latter example, if some of the โthreatening picaโ behaviors had been\ncorrectly reported and tracked in the residentโs behavioral data, it is possible that\nthe ingestion of the necklace and screw could have been prevented through timely\nintervention.  Choateโs failure to report adequately incidents and injuries departs\nsubstantially from generally accepted professional standards and violates the\nconstitutional rights of the individuals who reside at Choate. \nb.\t  Choate Fails to Identify Risk of Harm and Implement\nPreventive Actions  \nWhile incident management focuses on the collection and aggregation of data\nthat are meaningful to protect an individual from harm, risk management focuses\non identifying actual or potential harm from that data and taking timely action to\nprevent the harm from occurring.  Specifically, risk management involves: \n(1) identification of actual or potential risks of harm based on historical data,\ndiagnoses, and co-morbid conditions; (2) timely and appropriate intervention\nstrategies designed to reduce or eliminate the risks of harm; and (3) monitoring of\nthe efficacy of the intervention strategies and modifying the strategies in response\nto further data.  Choate fails to provide adequate risk management to its residents. \n2  Pica is a medical condition in which a person ingests or attempts to ingest\nnonfood substances such as clay, chalk, hair, or glue. \n\n- 10 -\nThe rate at which harm is occurring, combined with the patterns of the harm,\nindicate that Choate is failing to identify risks of harm and intervene in a timely \nmanner.  Although Choateโs incident and injury data are significantly\nunderreported, as described in the previous section, even the data that are reported\nshow that incidents and injuries are frequent and severe.  For example, from\nJanuary 1, 2007, to March 31, 2007, a 90-day period, one individual suffered 42\ninjuries from self-injurious behaviors, โaccidental events,โ or assaults by peers.  The \nnumber of injuries increased each month, from 11 in January, 14 in February, to 17\nin March.  Another individual, a forty-three-year-old blind resident with severe\nmental retardation, sustained injuries on ten different occasions from April 2007 to\nJune 2007, including a head laceration, a fractured thumb, and multiple abrasions\nand bruises.  Incidents and injuries occurring with such regularity and severity\nsuggest a failure to identify actual or potential risks to individuals and to respond\nwith appropriate interventions. \nEven where risks have been identified, however, Choate has inadequately\naddressed these risks.  During our tour, we discovered one individual, A.A.,3 whose \nSeptember 2006 Individualized Program Plan (โIPPโ) noted that she had sustained\nseveral injuries during the past year during transfers, because she is not\ncooperative with the procedure.  The Physical Therapy section of the\nSeptember 2006 IPP noted that โit is harder for one person to transferโ A.A.\nNevertheless, no plan was instituted to prevent further injuries, and one-person\ntransfers continued.  Throughout 2007, A.A. continued to suffer injuries during\ntransfers, including bruises, scratches, and lacerations.  Only after A.A. suffered a\nhead laceration from a fall during a one-person transfer in July 2007 did a\nphysician order that all future transfers be performed by two people.  Having\nidentified that A.A. was at risk of harm during transfers in September 2006, ten\nmonths before the physicianโs order, Choateโs failure to intervene in a timely and\nappropriate manner deviates substantially from generally accepted professional\nstandards and violates A.A.โs constitutional rights. \nThe intervention strategies that Choate has implemented are also not\nmonitored sufficiently to ensure that they prevent recurrences of potentially\nharmful behavior.  For example, a resident who inserted a metal needle and a\nplastic pick into her ears in response to ear irritation, causing bleeding in her ears,\nwas placed on 24-hour supervision and had all personal belongings confiscated that\ncould potentially be placed in her ears.  Approximately ten days later, after the ear \n3  To protect individualsโ privacy, we identify them by initials other than their \nown.  We will separately transmit to the State a schedule that cross-references the\ninitials with individualsโ names. \n\n- 11 -\ninfection subsided, all monitoring ceased and her belongings were returned.  The \nindividual continued to complain about ear irritation for the next two months, but\nno measures were taken.  The resident was then found bleeding from one ear, and\nan object was discovered deep inside the inner ear canal which had to be removed\nby an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist.  The short-term intervention of 24-hour \nsupervision and removal of certain objects was insufficient to prevent the potential\nfor future harm, and no further intervention was devised despite the residentโs\nongoing ear complaints. \nIn short, we found that individuals suffer harm as a result of Choateโs \nsubstantial departure from generally accepted professional standards in the three\nmain components of risk management:  risk identification, timely interventions, \nand monitoring of outcomes.  These conditions violate the Constitution. \nc.  Investigative Practices Are Deficient \nConstitutional mandates and generally accepted professional standards\ndictate that facilities like Choate investigate serious incidents such as alleged abuse\nand neglect, serious injury, and death.  During the investigation, evidence should be\nsystematically identified, collected, preserved, analyzed, and presented.\nInvestigators should attempt to determine the underlying cause of the incident by,\namong other things, reviewing staffโs adherence to programmatic requirements\nsuch as policies and procedures.  Such investigations are necessary to comply with\nan institutionโs duty to provide reasonable safety. \nThe investigative process at Choate substantially departs from these\nstandards.  As an initial matter, we noted during our tour that, in many cases,\nChoate permits staff against whom allegations have been made to return to duty\nbefore the investigation is complete or a well-supported, preliminary determination\nthat the employee poses no risk to individuals or the integrity of the investigation\nhas at least been made.  Even though Choate indicates that this is only done when\nthere is no credible evidence immediately available to support the allegation, this\npractice is still troubling.  It permits a staff member who has been accused of abuse\nor neglect to potentially commit further abuse or neglect if the preliminary decision\nto return them to their normal job was incorrect.  Furthermore, it affords the staff \nmember the opportunity to contaminate the investigation through coercion of\npotential witnesses, whether that coercion is real or merely perceived.  Choate \nshould not continue to permit this practice. \nMoreover, Choateโs actual investigations substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards in violation of the Constitution.  Our review of \nChoateโs investigations from November 2006 to July 2007 revealed that, out of 81\ninvestigations conducted, not a single one of the allegations of abuse or neglect was \n\n- 12 -\nsubstantiated.  Although there is an option for reconsideration of investigative\nfindings, Choate has not requested reconsideration since 2005.  The complete lack of\nsubstantiation of abuse and neglect allegations is suggestive of incomplete and\ninadequate investigations. \nOur review confirmed that the investigations are indeed inadequate.  We \nfound numerous cases where questionable inferences were drawn based on the facts\npresented, and many in which relevant questions were left unanswered.  For \nexample, an individual who eloped from Choate in March 2007 was aided in that\neffort by a staff member with whom he had an ongoing relationship.  After the \nelopement, the individual and staff member went to the staff memberโs home and\nhad sexual relations.  According to the resident, sometime following his elopement,\nbut while he was still at the staff memberโs home, someone from Choate called the \nstaff member to inform her that the resident had eloped.  While it is possible that\nthis was merely a routine phone call to a staff member who knew the resident, it\nstrongly suggests that someone at Choate was aware of the relationship between\nthe staff member and the resident.  There is no indication in the investigative\nrecord that anyone sought to determine who the caller was, or why that person\nwould place a call to the staff memberโs home.  Since the staff member has now \nbeen charged with sexual assault of a minor, it is possible that the caller was an\naccessory to the alleged crime, yet no follow-up was performed.  This is a serious \noversight in the investigative process.  It is also noteworthy that neither of the staff\nmembers responsible for checking the residentโs bed every 15 minutes had an\nallegation of neglect substantiated by investigators, even though the State\nregulatory agency required Choate to retrain both of them on this process. \nAnother example of inadequate investigations involves a pica incident,\nreferenced earlier, in which an individual ingested a necklace.  Despite two\neyewitness accounts by Choate residents stating that they observed a nurse leave\nthe necklace on a table and then saw the individual pick it up and swallow it,\nChoateโs investigators credited the testimony of the nurse, who denied placing a\nnecklace on the table, and another staff member, who simply stated that he never\nsaw the necklace in the room during a room sweep.  The reasons given for doubting\nthe witnessesโ accounts were weak, while the staff members had a clear motivation \nto deny their involvement.  Even if the inferences drawn were correct, however, the \nfailure to include sufficient detail to support these inferences in the investigative\nrecord demonstrates that the investigative process is inadequate. \nWe also saw evidence that the investigations were result-driven and were not\na full inquiry into the circumstances that led to the incident or injury.  For instance, \nthe individual involved in the pica incident noted above was the subject of two other\ninvestigations of pica incidents, and all three were determined to be\nunsubstantiated.  In one of the incidents, the investigator reported to Choate that \n\n- 13 -\nโ[a]t this point, with no negative outcome for the client, there is no credible\nevidence.โ  This suggests that the outcome of the investigation hinged more on\nwhether the individual suffered harm than whether neglect actually took place.\nThis is a troubling approach to investigations, especially in light of the individualโs\nongoing pica behaviors, which a detailed investigation may have aided in\npreventing. \nFinally, we observed that investigations at Choate tend to ignore trends in\nallegations.  For example, we noted that, between November 2006 and June 2007,\none staff member was alleged to have smothered the faces of three different\nresidents.  This is a highly specific allegation, and its repetition by different\nindividuals warranted further investigation.  Similarly, during the same time\nperiod, another staff member was alleged to have threatened four separate\nindividuals with physical harm, including death, if they did not do as directed.\nChoateโs apparent failure to detect these trends and perform further inquiry is a\nsignificant departure from generally accepted professional standards for\ninvestigations. \nChoateโs deficient investigative practices undermine its ability to respond to\nsituations of abuse and neglect, and increase the likelihood that harm will continue.\nBecause investigations are not thorough, staff members who may have potentially\nabused or neglected residents at Choate were permitted to continue interacting\nwith and caring for residents, leading to the potential for future harm.  The failure \nto take adequate steps to prevent this harm violates the constitutional rights of the\nindividuals who reside at Choate. \n2.  Quality Management Is Inadequate \nConstitutional requirements and generally accepted professional standards\nmandate that a facility like Choate develop and maintain an integrated system to\nmonitor and ensure quality of care across all aspects of care and treatment.  An \neffective quality management program must incorporate adequate systems for data\ncapture, retrieval, and statistical analysis to identify and track trends.  The \nprogram should also include a process for monitoring the effectiveness of corrective\nactions taken in response to problems that are discovered. \nChoate substantially departs from these standards.  We found that Choateโs \nquality management system was highly compartmentalized rather than integrated,\nand there was a lack of communication among departments.  Often, multiple forms\nmust be filled out for the same incident, but they are sent to different departments,\nincreasing the likelihood of discrepancies among the data reported.  As discussed \nearlier in this report, there were significant discrepancies between data reported in\nthe progress notes, clinical records, or external agency notifications and the \n\n- 14 -\nindividualโs and facilityโs aggregate data.  When asked, Choateโs quality assurance\nadministrator was unable to explain why these discrepancies existed.  The \nadministrator was unable to account for why numerous incidents found in the\nprogress notes or agency notifications were not found in the aggregated data\nmaintained in the quality management department.  The inadequacies of the\ncurrent quality management system have resulted in an environment where harm\nhas occurred without recognition or resolution and will continue to occur if better\nsystems are not put into place. \n3.\t  Seclusion and Restraint Usage At Choate Violates Constitutional\nStandards  \nConstitutional mandates and generally accepted professional standards\nrequire that, in an institution like Choate, restraints only be used when imminent\nrisk of harm to oneself or others is present.  Our review of Choateโs records indicate \nthat Choateโs restraint practices substantially depart from this standard. \nDespite recent efforts to reduce use of restraints, Choate continues to use\nrestraints routinely, and often places individuals in four-point and even five-point\nrestraints4 for unreasonably long periods of time, frequently without ever having\nattempted to use less intrusive measures.  Choateโs records indicate that several \nindividuals were restrained in this manner, on average, for more than two and a\nhalf hours.  Some restraints were much longer; we found examples of individuals\nwho were placed in mechanical restraints for more than six consecutive hours,\nincluding: \nโข\t  A.A., who was restrained for approximately four hours and eight\nhours, separated by a two hour and 15 minute time of release, in\nJuly 2007; \nโข\t  B.B., who was held in mechanical restraints for seven consecutive \nhours in December 2006; and \nโข\t  C.C., who was restrained for nearly six consecutive hours in\nOctober 2006. \n4  In a four-point restraint, an individual is placed on his bed on his back and\nhis wrists and ankles are secured by nylon straps; a five-point restraint includes all\nthe elements of a four-point restraint, with the addition of a strap placed across the\nindividualโs chest. \n\n- 15 -\nMost egregiously, during his last ten days at Choate before discharge, D.D.\nwas held in four-point or five-point restraints for nine consecutive hours on two\noccasions, twelve consecutive hours on another occasion, and approximately sixteen\nconsecutive hours on yet another occasion.  In total, this individual spent more than\n45 hours in restraints during his last ten days at Choate.  This high-level of\nrestraint use departs substantially from generally accepted professional standards\nand violates the restrained individualsโ constitutional rights. \nC.  Choate Does Not Provide Adequate Health and Psychiatric Care \n1.  Health Care Is Reactive and Uncoordinated \nThe Supreme Court has determined that institutionalized persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities are entitled to adequate medical care.  Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. at 324.  The Court labeled this as one of the โessentials of care that \nthe State must provide.โ  Id.  There are many positive aspects of medical care at\nChoate.  In particular, the facility has the benefit of clinically competent, dedicated\nphysicians and nursing leadership.  These disciplines, however, are currently not\nstructured in a manner allowing them to be sufficiently responsive to the population\nthey serve, exposing individuals to risk of harm. \nForemost, health care at Choate is reactive rather than forward-looking.\nReactive health care occurs when an individualโs access to care depends upon the\nperson presenting themselves for assessment and treatment, while proactive health\ncare requires medical professionals to identify individuals at risk, to perform\nassessments, and to provide appropriate treatment.  In a residential disability\ncenter setting such as Choate, individuals are often unable to articulate their health\nstatus to staff or request medical attention due to intellectual or developmental\ndisabilities.  Given these conditions, constitutional mandates require Choate to\nensure that the health care provided is sufficiently proactive to identify potential\nhealth issues, to intervene before harm or suffering occurs due to illness or injury,\nand to provide access to health care as soon as possible once symptoms indicating a\nhealth problem arise.  Regrettably, due to reactive health care delivery, Choate\noften fails to do enough to identify, assess, treat, and monitor its residents,\nespecially those with complex and high-risk conditions.  Choateโs provision of\nreactive medical care undermines the other care and treatment provided at Choate\nand may unnecessarily prolong individualsโ stay at Choate.  A.A., discussed in \nSection II.B.1.b, had 24 injury reports from October 13, 2006 to July 11, 2007, for an\naverage of 2.6 per month.  A significant number of these injuries occurred during\ntransfers of A.A. to and from her wheelchair.  While Choate responded\nappropriately to each individual injury when it occurred, we could not find any\nevidence that her treatment team recognized this high rate of injury and formulated\na plan to address it.  Only after a fall in July 2007 did A.A.โs physician order all \n\n- 16 -\ntransfers be performed by two people.  Choateโs failure to take steps to prevent\nharm to A.A. is a substantial departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards and violates A.A.โs constitutional rights. \nChoateโs medical staff primarily utilizes a โsick-callโ system to respond\nmedically to individuals once direct care staff or a nurse has identified a resident\nwith symptoms that warrant further assessment by a physician.  Once identified as \nneeding a physicianโs care, Choate residents are typically examined and evaluated\nby a physician at one of the clinical examination rooms on the facilityโs campus.\nChoateโs use of clinic-based treatment is standard community practice and is\nacceptable in a developmental disability center setting.  However, this model is not \na substitute for methods necessary to ensure that health care providers are\nadequately monitoring the health status of residents and responding in a timely\nfashion.  In this regard, attending physicians at Choate should also conduct clinical\nrounds on the residential units to facilitate routine interaction with direct care staff \nknowledgeable about residentsโ medical status.  Furthermore, clinical rounds would \nprovide attending physicians an opportunity to assess residents in their living\nenvironment, where they are likely to learn about and address health related\nmatters with residents before more serious signs of illness occur.   \nChoateโs reactive approach to health care is compounded by the ineffective\ncoordination of health care services at the facility.  There is often inadequate\ncollaboration and coordination between and among the various health care\ndisciplines.  Failure to coordinate health care appropriately increases the likelihood\nthat health professionals will pursue a course of treatment that may negatively\nimpact another health care providerโs treatment and jeopardize the overall care\nthat a resident ultimately receives.  Risk to residents is further increased as \nresidentsโ charts often do not adequately reflect the health care decision-making\nprocess or reveal clearly what is happening with residents.  Current and future\nplans of care are difficult to discern from the charts, placing residents at risk of\nharm because of poor communication and lack of coordination about their care and \ntreatment.  The following examples demonstrate the poor communication and lack\nof coordination in the provision of health care services at Choate, as well as the\nserious omissions from the medical charts, and emphasize the constitutionally\nsignificant harm that can occur from these deficiencies: \nโข\t  E.E.โs May 2007 monthly review indicates that his neurologist\nrecommended increasing the amount of one medication he received,\nuntil he was informed by E.E.โs primary physician that a higher dose\nof that medication had, in the past, produced ataxia, an inability to\ncontrol voluntary muscular disorders.  This suggests that this\ninformation was not in his medical chart, was not in a part of his chart\nthat his neurologist typically would have reviewed, or was not \n\n- 17 -\ncommunicated from one discipline to the other, as his primary\nphysician had clear knowledge of these past effects.  Had E.E.โs \nprimary physician not discovered this recommendation, E.E. would\nlikely have suffered further harm.  E.E.โs physicianโs knowledge of\nE.E.โs medical history is impressive and speaks well of his competence.\nNevertheless, a health care systemโs reliance on an individualโs\nrecollection, rather than an accurate, accessible medical record, is \ninappropriate and unsafe; \nโข\t  F.F. was found unresponsive in his room on April 14, 2007, and was\ntaken to the local hospital.  According to the admitting doctor at the\nlocal hospital, his โhistory is extremely sketchy, most of the\ninformation is available from the Emergency Room.โ  This statement \nstrongly suggests that the information Choate provided to the local\nhospital was inadequate; and \nโข\t  Similarly, on February 23, 2007, G.G. was admitted to the local\nhospital for treatment of pneumonia.  Her January 25, 2007, Behavior\nIntervention Plan indicates that she was receiving 500 milligrams of\nClozapine, but the admitting note does not indicate that she was on\nthis medication when listing her medications, despite indicating that\nthe admitting doctor had a conversation with her primary physician at\nChoate.  There is no indication in the record that the medication had \nbeen discontinued before her admission to the hospital.  If this \nmedication was in fact inadvertently discontinued at the time of her\nadmission, she would have gone from receiving a significant dose of the\nmedication to none at all in one 24-hour period. \nOther factors also serve to diminish the level of coordinated health care at \nChoate.  For instance, Choateโs medical, psychiatric, and psychology staff rely\nheavily on informal meetings and conversations to relay information about\nresidentsโ health care status.  Unfortunately, in many instances, the underlying\nfacts of these discussions are never recorded as part of the individualโs medical\nhistory.  As a result, Choate health professionals have failed to identify situations\nwhere individuals required additional health consultations with other Choate or\ncommunity-based health care providers.  For example, E.E. has an active psychotic\ndisorder and a seizure disorder that have been well-documented for several years.\nChoateโs past trials of antipsychotic medications have produced an increase in\nseizures, so they were suspended.  While the suspension of the trials may be\nreasonable, it does not appear that Choate professionals have considered obtaining\na specific neuropsychiatry consultation to attempt to identify an antipsychotic agent\nthat would not lower his seizure threshold.  In our review, we also noted that \nresidentsโ charts and records often did not contain discharge summaries from \n\n- 18 -\noutside hospitals or emergency room visits, and that documentation of discussions\nwith external specialty consultations was inconsistent, ranging from excellent to\nnon-existent.  This is a substantial departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards. \nThese deficiencies in overall medical care place residents at risk, but there is\neven greater risk for residents in two discrete areas of care:  (1) the administration\nof psychotropic medication; and (2) physical and nutritional management services. \n2.\t  Administration of Psychotropic Medication Departs Substantially\nFrom Generally Accepted Practices \nPsychotropic medications are not dispensed in accordance with generally\naccepted professional standards at Choate.  Constitutional and professional\nstandards dictate that psychotropic medications are prescribed consistent with a\ndocumented psychiatric diagnosis and empirically-based evidence of the\nmedicationsโ efficacy.  Moreover, psychiatric professionals should record\nempirically-based evidence of the psychotropic medicationsโ efficacy, along with all\nattempts to determine the minimum effective dose of the medication for the\nresident.  Without this information, treating professionals are unable to conduct an\nadequate risk analysis to determine whether the medicationโs inherent side effects\nare outweighed by the efficacy of the drug.  The inappropriate use of psychotropic\nmedications may undercut the other care and treatment provided at Choate,\nmaking it more difficult for the individual to move to a more integrated setting. \nDuring our tour, we discovered that several individuals at Choate were\nreceiving psychotropic medications, including first generation psychotropics, at\ndosages well-above accepted therapeutic dosages without any empirical evidence of\nthe medicationsโ efficacy or any attempts to identify the medicationโs minimum\neffective dose.  The medications for the following individuals are illustrative of these \nproblems: \nโข  H.H. has been prescribed 75 milligrams of Haloperidol per day, a much\nhigher dose than is usually utilized.  Our review of his records \nindicated that there is no documentation of psychotic symptoms, and\nthe frequency of his monitored behaviors is low.  Moreover, his \nbehavioral difficulties appear to be, in part, secondary to a closed head\ninjury in childhood.  Nevertheless, Choate has not made any attempt\nto decrease the amount of Haloperidol he receives; and \nโข  I.I. was given 50 milligrams of Haloperidol per day until May 3, 2007,\nat which time her prescription was reduced to 48 milligrams of\nHaloperidol per day.  Our consultant could not find any empirical data \n\n- 19 -\nto support this large of a dose of Haloperidol.  Indeed, when I.I.โs dose \nwas reduced from 50 milligrams to 48 milligrams, no clinical\ndeterioration appears to have resulted.  This suggests that no effort\nhas been made to find the minimum effective dose of Haloperidol for\nI.I. \nThese residents are at unjustifiable risk of harm due to excessive and long-term\nexposure to these medications, including tardive dyskinesia.5  \nWe also found a significant diagnostic-therapeutic disconnect at Choate and a\nlack of detailed documentation in records where the residentโs diagnosis does not\nclearly explain the psychotropic regimen in place.  This therapeutic-disconnect\nresults in insufficient explanation or justification in individual records for current\nand future clinical decision-making.  Therefore, the potential harm to residents is\ntwo-fold:  the person may be treated with inappropriate and/or unnecessary\nmedications and, at the same time, will not receive proper treatment for the\nunderlying mental illness.  Similarly, our expert reviewed a number of cases where\nexemptions from scheduled reductions in antipsychotic medications have been\nrequested and granted absent concurrent empirical evidence that the scheduled\nreduction in medication would be harmful to the resident.  This diagnostic-\ntherapeutic disconnect impairs other aspects of the treatment provided at Choate,\nunnecessarily prolongs individualsโ institutionalization at Choate, and accordingly\ncontributes to violations of the Constitution and Olmstead.  The following examples\nillustrate the diagnostic-therapeutic disconnect present at Choate: \nโข\t  J.J. was prescribed the psychotropic medications Pimozide,\nHaloperidol, and Clonazepam, the stated goal for which was to reduce\nor eliminate symptoms of Touretteโs syndrome.6  According to her\nrecords, the dosage of all three of these medications has been\nincreasing, but no empirical evidence of the efficacy of these\nmedications at reducing the severity of the Touretteโs disorder is\nincluded in her records; \n5  Tardive dyskinesia is a muscular side effect of anti-psychotic drugs and is\nprimarily characterized by random movements in the tongue, lips, or jaw as well as\nfacial grimacing, movements of arms, legs, fingers, and toes, or even swaying\nmovements of the trunk or hips. \n6  Touretteโs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by multiple\ninvoluntary movements and vocalizations, or tics, which are frequent, repetitive,\nand rapid. \n\n- 20 -\nโข\t  K.K. occasionally displays inappropriate behaviors, including, most\nnotably, physical aggression that involves pulling the hair of staff\nmembers.  He is currently prescribed Perphenazine, a psychotropic\nmedication.  According to our consultantโs review of his record,\nhowever, there is an absence of any description of psychotic symptoms,\nand there is a notation that a behavior program developed for K.K. in\nthe 1990s was effective in reducing the frequency of the physical\naggression and hair pulling.  It is therefore not clear that the \nPerphenazine is being used to treat a psychotic disorder rather than to\nsuppress aggression, which may be occurring on a behavioral basis.\nMoreover, there is evidence in the record that K.K. has manifested \nmotor side effects that have required treatment with Benztropine, and\nthat he has also developed dysphagia,7 potentially related to the\nPerphenazine; \nโข\t  L.L. is 44-year-old male who weighed 236 pounds in April 2007, which\nis 137 percent of his ideal body weight.  He is currently on Risperidone,\nand one of the known side effects of this medication is weight gain. \nNevertheless, the section of the record that primarily addresses\npotential negative side effects focuses primarily on the possible effect\non his motor skills.  While Risperidone can have some effect on motor\nskills, the most significant side effects are its metabolic side effects and\nthe potential for weight gain.  Especially given L.L.โs obesity, his\ntreatment should at least acknowledge the potential for Risperidone to\nbe exacerbating this problem and consider transitioning him to a more\nweight-neutral medication.  Moreover, the frequency and intensity of\nhis behaviors, as recorded, are not significant enough to bar\nconsideration of a reduction in his Risperidone dosage; and \nโข\t  M.M. has a long history of violent outbursts, physical aggression, self-\ninjurious behaviors, and inappropriate sexual behaviors.  During our\nreview of his records, we found that, although he has been on many\ndifferent psychotropic medications, it was noted that none of them\nhave been effective at controlling his maladaptive behaviors.  We also \nfound no documentation of symptoms related to a psychotic disorder.\nNevertheless, M.M. is currently on 600 milligrams of Lithium and 40\nmilligrams of Haloperidol per day, despite a May 9, 2005, consultation\nthat recommended decreasing the Lithium until discontinued, and a\nlack of any empirical evidence that the Haloperidol has been helpful,\nespecially at the given dosage, which is higher than usually used. \n7  Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty in swallowing. \n\n- 21 -\nFurthermore, we could find no documentation in the record that a \nsustained attempt has been made to determine the lowest effective\ndose of Haloperidol for M.M. \nThe continuation of these individuals on psychotropic medications that are not\nclinically justified by their symptoms, especially in unusually high dosages, or that\nmay be having significant side effects when other medication options have not been\nattempted, exposes these individuals to unjustifiable risk of harm from the\npotential side effects inherent in the use of these medications. \nDuring our review, we noted that Choate routinely documents data regarding\nthe frequency of monitored behavioral symptoms.  There was no documented \nevidence, however, that Choate routinely measures the intensity of monitored \nsymptoms.  To make appropriate dosage changes and assess the overall efficacy of\nthe psychotropic medication administered, both frequency and intensity must be\nroutinely measured and recorded.  In the example of M.M., above, we could only\nfind data on the frequency of his maladaptive behaviors, and none on their\nintensity. \nFinally, as discussed in the previous section, Choate fails to ensure the\nadequate documentation of interdisciplinary collaborations between psychiatry,\npsychology, and medicine and here again relies too heavily on informal\nconversations to relay information necessary for adequate treatment decisions. \nChoateโs psychiatrist and medical doctors indicated during interviews with our\nconsulting expert that extensive discussions between psychiatry and medical occur\nbefore psychotropic regimes are implemented or changed.  However, the subsequent\nrecord review by our expert revealed only infrequent and cursory documentation of\nthese discussions.  Furthermore, where discussions and empirical data do exist in\nthe residentโs record, this information does not appear to be used to inform the\nclinical decision-making process on a regular basis. \n3. \t Physical and Nutritional Management Are Not Adequately\nIndividualized \nPhysical and nutritional management services are a significant aspect of\nadequate health care services for persons with developmental disabilities.  These \nsupports should minimize risks associated with swallowing and digestion\ndysfunctions that predispose an individual to an increased risk of bowel impaction,\nchoking, and aspiration, including aspiration pneumonia.  In this area particularly,\nvulnerable residents need forward-looking care to prevent problems that can lead to\nillness, hospitalization, and death. \n\n- 22 -\n\nChoate, to its credit, does ensure that some aspects of physical and\nnutritional management are adequate.  Generally accepted professional standards\nrequire that Choate assess residents for risk of dysphagia and implement\nappropriate dietary and programmatic safeguards based on these assessments to\nprevent the occurrence of harm from swallowing dysfunction.  Choateโs risk \nassessments are generally adequate.  Barium swallowing studies are consistently\nconducted by off-ground community providers when initial assessments suggest this\nis necessary.  Further, there is appropriate consultation between the attending\nphysician and speech pathologist to perform initial swallowing evaluations and\nidentify significant swallowing problems that develop in individual residents. \nNevertheless, there are significant deficiencies in Choateโs physical and\nnutritional management, which pose serious risks to residents.  Choate does not \nensure that appropriate dietary and programmatic safeguards are implemented to\nprevent the risk of harm from dysphagia.  First, the administration of the correct \nmeal to the correct individual relies too heavily on staff recognition of the individual\nwithout a back-up system, such as picture cards, to facilitate resident identification. \nThe current system creates the potential for a resident to receive the food tray of\nanother individual in error.  During dining, it is imperative that residents receive\nthe correct dining tray to ensure proper nutritional needs are met and to ensure the\nhealth and safety of individuals who require foods of a certain texture or\nconsistency. \nSecond, because Choate employs family-style dining, which normalizes the\ndining atmosphere, individuals with dysphagia are at greater risk and need to be\nclosely monitored to prevent them from eating too rapidly or from impulsively\ntaking food from another residentโs tray.  Although many of Choateโs residents are\ncurrently functioning at a level that does not put them at risk of choking and\naspiration, there is a distinct population of individuals whose physical status\nrenders them vulnerable to dysphagia, choking, and aspiration.  Choateโs meal \ncards and monitoring plans, however, are not sufficiently individualized for those\nresidents who have empirically-determined risks for dysphagia, choking, and\naspiration to provide guidance to staff members on how they should interact with\nthe individual, including interactions such as prompting the individual regarding\npacing of food intake.  The failure to provide adequately individualized meal plans,\nalong with failure to provide sufficient identification of individuals with meal plans,\ndeparts substantially from generally accepted professional standards and places\nthese individuals at risk of harm, including aspiration pneumonia and death, in\nviolation of these individualsโ constitutional rights. \n\n- 23 -\nD.  Choateโs Behavioral, Habilitation, and Communication Services Are \nDeficient \nChoateโs residents are entitled to โthe minimally adequate training required\nby the Constitution . . . as may be reasonable in light of [the residentsโ] liberty\ninterests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.โ  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 322.  The purpose of this training is to enable of the movement of individuals into\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs as required by Olmstead. \n527 U.S. at 607.  Generally accepted professional standards of care require that\nappropriate psychological interventions, such as behavior programs and habilitation\nplans,8 be used to address significant behavior problems and assist residents to live\nin more integrated settings.  Choate has the benefit of a competent staff of\npsychologists.  However, as of the time of our visit, the facility lacked a chief of\npsychology and lacked sufficient psychologists to meet the various needs of Choateโs\nresidents.  Many of the deficiencies addressed below relate to these staffing\nproblems and to the absence of rigorous clinical oversight.  In any event, Choate\nfails in important respects to provide adequate psychology services to meet the\nneeds of its residents. \n1.  Behavior Programs Are Ineffective \nUse of challenging, even harmful (โmaladaptiveโ) behaviors frequently can be\nan issue for persons with developmental disabilities, and are often one of the\nreasons the individual is placed in an institutional setting.  The harm from such \nbehaviors can be severe, even fatal.  Examples include punching, slapping,\nscratching oneself or others, intentionally destroying property, or pica.  The causes \nof these behaviors often reflect the primary characteristic of developmental\ndisability โ difficulty learning, in this case, learning effective and healthy ways to\nmeet oneโs needs and wants. \nIndicia that a facility is having difficulty addressing challenging behaviors\ninclude high rates of harm to oneself or others, and indicia that a facility lacks\nadequate behavioral interventions include high rates of restraints and clinically\nunjustified psychotropic medications.  Regrettably, these indicia are present at\nChoate.  The failure to address challenging behaviors adequately inhibits the\nmovement of individuals to a more integrated setting in compliance with Olmstead. \n8  Habilitation includes, but is not limited to, individualized training,\neducation, and skill acquisition programs developed and implemented by\ninterdisciplinary teams to promote the growth, development, and independence of\nindividuals. \n\n- 24 -\nAs noted in Section II.C.2, supra, Choate substantially departs from\ngenerally accepted professional standards concerning the use of psychotropic\nmedication for individuals with intellectual disabilities.  There are a number of \nindividuals at Choate who are receiving dosages of psychotropic medication that are\nabove what are usually thought to be effective therapeutic dosages.  There also does \nnot appear to be an attempt to determine minimally effective dosages (โMEDsโ) for\nmany of these individuals.  Furthermore, our review found a pattern of continuing\nindividuals on high dosages of antipsychotic agents, despite the lack of any\nempirical evidence that the medication has been helpful. \nSimilarly, Choate substantially departs from generally accepted professional\nstandards regarding restraint use.  As described supra at Section II.B.3, we found \nnumerous instances where individuals were held in mechanical restraints for \nexcessive periods of time, and the manner in which many of the restraints were\nused, as well as the repeated use of restraints on the same individual, indicate that\nstaff members were unable to respond appropriately to the behaviors that the\nindividual was manifesting. \nFurther, Choate fails to use appropriate behavioral interventions.  Generally\naccepted professional standards of practice provide that behavioral interventions\nshould be:  (1) based upon adequate assessments of the causes and โfunctionโ (i.e.,\npurpose) of the behavior; (2) be implemented as written; and (3) be monitored and\nevaluated adequately.  Ineffective behavioral interventions increase the likelihood \nthat residents engage in maladaptive behaviors, subjecting them to unnecessarily\nrestrictive interventions and treatments.  Choateโs behavioral interventions are \noften not effective, based on deficiencies that depart from generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  In particular, they often are not based on adequate\nassessments, and often are not monitored, evaluated, and revised adequately.  The \nfailure to provide adequate behavioral interventions violates these individualsโ\nconstitutional rights and may unnecessarily prolong these individualsโ\ninstitutionalization at Choate. \na.  Behavioral Assessments Are Inadequate \nWithout a thorough assessment of the function of an individualโs maladaptive\nbehavior, including clearly identified, appropriate replacement behaviors,\nbehavioral interventions will not be successful in modifying the maladaptive\nbehavior.  In this regard, a functional assessment identifies the particular positive\nor negative factors that prompt or maintain a challenging behavior for a given\nindividual.  By understanding the precursors and, separately, the purposes or\nโfunctions,โ of challenging behaviors, professionals can attempt to reduce or\neliminate these factorsโ influence, and thus reduce or eliminate the challenging\nbehaviors.  Without such informed understanding of the cause of behaviors, \n\n- 25 -\nattempted treatments are arbitrary and ineffective.  Choate's functional \nassessments are not adequate for this purpose.  They do not effectively guide\nselection of replacement behaviors or intervention procedures, frequently resulting\nin a weak relationship between assessment results and intervention programs.  For \nexample, N.N.โs behavior intervention plan (โBIPโ) indicates that his โproblematic\nbehavior is maintained by him trying to escape9 staff requests, gaining attention,\nand access to tangible items.โ  His replacement behaviors are defined as:  โUnit \nIncentive Program,โ โEmpathy Skill,โ and โSocial Skills.โ  On their face, these \nprograms would not teach N.N. how he can escape requests or gain attention or\ntangibles in more socially acceptable ways.  The lack of an adequate behavioral\nassessment leading to an appropriate behavioral intervention plan to address his\nmaladaptive behaviors inhibits N.N.โs ability to move to a more integrated setting. \nSeparately, as Choateโs policies reflect, it is important to conduct intellectual\nassessments of individuals at regular intervals.  Particularly as persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities age (especially persons having Down Syndrome) and are\nexposed to long-term doses of cognition-altering psychotropic medications, their\ncognitive abilities can change significantly.  Such changes affect their habilitation\nneeds, as discussed in Section II.D.2, infra, but they also affect their needs for, and\nthe nature of, the behavioral interventions that they receive.  Similarly, these\nassessments are sometimes a requisite for discharge planning.  Yet, in practice,\nChoate is not conducting such assessments when needed.  For instance, at the time \nof our visit, O.O.โs PSP notes that his last intellectual assessment occurred in \nMarch of 2002.  As of the time of our visit, he was past due for reassessment,\naccording to the policy of the facility and generally accepted professional standards\nof care.  P.P.โs PSP, dated April 19, 2007, notes that his most recent intellectual\nassessment was on August 15, 2001, which again departs from Choateโs policies and\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Similarly, the psychometric (i.e.,\nintellectual aptitude) assessment section of Q.Q.โs BIP (dated April 7, 2005, and\nrevised June 14, 2007) indicates that he was last assessed on May 9, 1996.  These \nexamples demonstrate Choateโs failure to conduct intellectual assessments as \nnecessary. \nMaladaptive behavior is frequently a form of communication for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities who lack the tools to communicate more conventionally. \nConsequently, although a complete functional assessment should address\ncommunication, a separate, reliable communication assessment should be routinely\nused to identify the role of communication in an individual's maladaptive behaviors\nand, separately, as discussed below regarding habilitation, to identify appropriate \n9  โEscapeโ is a term used in psychology to describe certain types of avoidance\nbehavior. \n\n- 26 -\nlearning objectives and interventions that enable the individual to move to a more\nintegrated setting.  Relatedly, another common cause of maladaptive behavior is\npain.  Failure to respond timely to pain obviously leads to avoidable suffering and is\nrecognized as contributing to increases in maladaptive behaviors.  Choateโs \ncommunication assessment inventories reflect an understanding of the linkages\nbetween communication and behavior.  However, it appears from our review that\ncommunication assessments at Choate are performed only infrequently. \nFurther, where assessments did occur, we found breakdowns in the diagnoses\nthat were subsequently rendered.  For instance, the psychometric assessment\nsection of Q.Q.โs BIP (dated April 7, 2005; revised June 14, 2007) indicates that he\nhas a full scale IQ of 58.  However, his Axis II diagnoses include โModerate Mental\nRetardation,โ a diagnosis that would require a significantly lower IQ score.  Failure \nto reflect assessment results accurately in Clinical Diagnoses may lead to an\ninaccurate perception of individuals and inappropriate treatment planning.  In this \nregard, our consultants found a repeated lack of support for psychiatric diagnoses\nwhere assessments from psychologists would be warranted.  For instance, Q.Q.โs \nsame BIP includes an Axis II diagnosis of personality disorder, NOS (not otherwise\nspecified).  The narrative does not offer any justification for this diagnosis, nor does\nit reference any observable behavioral criteria obviously associated with this\npsychiatric diagnosis.  Interventions premised upon clinically unsupported\ndiagnoses will be effective only by happenstance and easily can be\ncounter-therapeutic, particularly the unwarranted use of psychotropic medication,\nwhich is a significant issue at this facility. \nb. \t Behavioral Interventions Are Inappropriate,\nInsufficient, or Non-Existent \nAccording to generally accepted professional standards, effective behavioral\ninterventions should target the function of the maladaptive behavior to the\nmaximum extent possible and be built on replacing the maladaptive behavior with a\nhealthy alternative behavior that serves the same function.  To a lesser extent, \nbehavioral interventions may include modifying the environmental causes of the\nmaladaptive behavior.  Although effective behavioral interventions typically include\na means of redirecting an individual from a maladaptive behavior, this is distinct\nfrom seeking only to control or suppress the maladaptive behavior. \nBehavioral interventions at Choate substantially departs from generally\naccepted professional standards in important respects.  As noted above, the facility\nis relying excessively on psychotropic medications and physical restraints to control\nbehaviors.  This is, in part, due to the fact that Choateโs behavioral assessments do\nnot lead to effective behavioral interventions, as discussed in the previous section of\nthis letter.  Nevertheless, in several instances where assessments, coupled with \n\n- 27 -\nobservations and record review, pointed to an environmental factor (distinct from\nmental illness) as the function of a behavior, it appeared that Choate did not use\nthis information to identify appropriate replacement behaviors or to attempt to\nmodify the environmental factor.  Further, the identified replacement behaviors\nwere often too broadly stated to be useful, as in the above example of N.N. \nMoreover, we found multiple examples of individuals who had been identified\nas having significant maladaptive behaviors but who nevertheless were not\nreceiving structured behavioral interventions to address these behaviors.  For \ninstance, our consultant noted that two individuals on the forensic unit (R.R. and\nS.S.) were noted to be at risk for self-injurious behavior (โSIBโ) but neither had a\nbehavior intervention plan.  Further, a treatment team presented data at E.E.โs\ntransition meeting regarding behaviors of โnoncompliance,โ โproperty destruction,โ\nโphysical aggression,โ and โverbal aggression.โ  Yet, E.E. did not have a behavior \nintervention plan to address them. \nFurther, there should be a clinical congruence among targeted behaviors,\nassessments, and interventions.  Yet, we found instances of inconsistency, even as\nto what an individualโs target maladaptive behaviors were.  For instance, N.N.โs \nbehavior improvement plan did not identify the same target behaviors as were\nlisted in his individual education plan (โIEPโ).  Physical aggression,\nteasing/provoking, and self-injurious behavior are included on his BIP but not on\nhis IEP. \nMore fundamentally, we found repeated examples of Choateโs failure to\nrevisit behavioral interventions in response to compelling evidence that an\nindividual's maladaptive behaviors were not improving, or were even deteriorating. \nThis was true even at mandatory annual reviews that are expressly structured to\naddress such issues.  For instance, T.T.โs PSP of February 13, 2007, states that,\nโ[o]verall, [M.] has shown an increase in the frequency or intensity of the target\nbehaviors.โ  In fact, our review found that all of T.T.โs challenging behaviors for\nwhich there was data from the previous year showed an approximately four-fold\nincrease during the first part of the year.  Yet, the recommendation was to \nโ[c]ontinue current Behavior Intervention Plan.โ  Between December 2006 and \nMarch 2007, Choate conducted four โSpecial Program Reviewsโ for T.T. due to\ninjuries caused by SIB.  The facility added interventions consisting of body checks\nat shift change, one-to-one supervision of T.T. at night, and use of restraints.\nHowever, these interventions are focused exclusively on restricting behavior, not\nmodifying it.  Significantly, T.T.โs monthly summary reviews for this period stated\nthat the behavior program \"[c]ontinues to meet individualโs needs.โ  Our consultant \nconcluded that, apart from continuing a reduction of this individualโs psychotropic\nmedication, โthere was no indication of a team response to his behavioral status.โ\nAdditionally, repeated use of restraints at Choate do not lead to meaningful \n\n- 28 -\nreassessments of behavioral interventions or to warranted revisions in \ninterventions.  Our consultant further opined that, โ[t]he failure to revise\nbehavioral intervention plans in response to a lack of progress or to significant\nevents is perhaps the most serious indictment of behavioral treatment at Choate.โ \nAs noted previously, the failure to implement timely and appropriate\nbehavioral interventions undermines the other care and treatment provided at\nChoate, prolongs these individualsโ use of maladaptive behaviors that led to their\ninstitutionalization, and impairs their ability to move to more integrated settings. \nc.\t  Implementation of Behavioral Treatment Is Not\nDocumented or Observed \nConsistent and correct implementation of appropriate behavioral\ninterventions is essential.  Choate uses a โBehavior Drill Procedure,โ that โrequires\nthat the staff person demonstrate/role play rather than discuss how to implement\nprocedures outlined in the Behavior Drill.โ  However, it appears that Choate\nfrequently fails to meet this standard.  As an initial matter, training records did not\nreveal which staff should have been trained on BIPs using the Behavior Drill, when\nthe training should have been completed, or which staff have yet to be trained on\nany given program.  Morever, the facility's practice, as of the time of our review,\ndoes not include observation of staff implementing any aspect of the behavior plan.\nThis is a significant deficiency; without relative certainty that plans are being\nimplemented as designed, it is impossible to determine whether a behavioral plan is\neffective. \nd. \t Monitoring and Evaluation of Behavioral Programs\nIs Inadequate \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care require that facilities\nmonitor residents who have behavior programs to assess the residentsโ progress and\nthe program's efficacy.  Without the necessary monitoring and evaluation, residents\nare in danger of being subjected to inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive\ntreatment, to avoidable injuries related to untreated behaviors, and to\nunnecessarily prolonged institutionalization, all in violation of the Constitution and\nOlmstead. \nAs a threshold matter, Choate does not assess, for clinical purposes, critical\naspects of psychological services at the facility, such as the use of restraints, the use\nof emergency procedures, the development and update of functional assessments,\nand staff implementation of programs.  There is no systemic tracking and analysis\nof the type of restrictive components contained in BIPs.  In fact, as noted previously,\nwe found several instances of restraint use that were not recorded in Choate's \n\n- 29 -\nrestraint database.  Thus, Choateโs current reliance on restraint data for clinical \npurposes would likely lead to flawed assessments of treatment efficacy on both an\nindividual and a systemic basis. \nFurther, as noted in Section II.C.2, supra, Choate relies heavily on\npsychotropic medications as a primary form of behavioral intervention, although it\nis seeking to reduce the use of psychotropics.  As for traditional behavioral \ninterventions, although Choate gathers some data to assess the interventionsโ\nefficacy, the facility lacks a standard, clinically justified method to gather data and\nconfirm its accuracy.  Additionally, the presence or absence of replacement\nbehaviors, which mitigate or prevent the maladaptive behaviorโs occurrence, is\nrarely tracked.  In short, Choate lacks a means to ensure that appropriate data are\naccurately and consistently reported. \nMoreover, the BIPs we reviewed failed to provide adequate strategies for\nmeasuring the effectiveness of the plan.  The outcomes currently emphasized by\nChoate to measure effectiveness focus on reducing the frequency of problem\nbehaviors but fail to address improving skills or increasing independence\nadequately so that individuals can be moved to more integrated settings.  Although\nthe BIPs all mention collecting data regarding the occurrence of problem behaviors,\nplans fail to describe clearly, or in some cases to mention, the methods used to\npromote positive replacement behaviors.  Teams routinely fail to monitor data\nregarding the individualโs use of such behaviors. \ne. \t Quality Assurance and Oversight of Behavioral\nSupport Services Are Insufficient \nFurther, the safeguard of professional review and monitoring of behavior\nsupport services, as of our tour, is not taking place at Choate.  These \nresponsibilities largely fall on an adequate peer review process (an assessment of a\npractitionerโs work by other professionals in the field to foster compliance with the\ngenerally accepted professional standards of the discipline) and a functioning\nbehavior intervention committee (โBICโ).  Neither of these important safeguards\nare functioning at Choate.  In particular, we found that the BIC is not appropriately\nevaluating the content and quality of the behavior programs, or whether they meet\nprofessional standards.  The BICโs failure to provide critical and substantive review\nof behavior intervention plans permits behavior programs to continue when these\nprograms are ineffective, inefficient, and inconsistent.  The BIC nearly universally\napproved every plan submitted to it during the time of our review.  In particular,\nafter reviewing approximately 120 pages of the BICโs minutes, our consultant did\nnot find any instance where the BIC rejected a BIP, and only found a single\ninstance where the BIC approved a BIP โpending incorporation of required change,โ\nalthough the required change was not identified in the BICโs minutes.  We learned \n\n- 30 -\nduring our visit that the Stateโs chief psychologist for developmental disability\nservices was being dispatched to Choate on an interim basis, in part to address the\nlack of oversight in Choateโs behavioral support services. \nSeparately, although the behavior intervention process includes an\nassessment of the individualโs rights, our review indicated that restrictive\nbehavioral interventions were being implemented without prior approval from\neither of Choateโs BIC or its Human Rights Committee (โHRCโ).  We found repeated\nexamples of restrictive interventions that apparently were not subject to such\noversight.  For instance, O.O. received a โspecial program reviewโ on \nJanuary 5, 2006, at which the treatment team recommended property searches on\nreturn from off-grounds activities.  Such searches were not included in O.O.โs BIP. \nOur consultant determined from record review that โthere is no indication that they\nwere approved by the BIC or HRC.โ  In fact, our record review did not uncover \ninstances where the HRC provided any substantive review or discussion of\nrestrictive behavioral interventions prior to approving them. \n2.\t  Habilitation Programs Do Not Meet Generally Accepted\n\nProfessional Standards\n \nPersons with developmental disabilities are to receive adequate habilitation\ntraining and related vocational and day program services and supports so that they\nmay acquire new skills, grow and develop, and enhance their independence so they\ncan move to more integrated settings.  Federal regulations require that: \nEach client must receive a continuous active treatment program, which\nincludes aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized\nand generic training, treatment, health services and related services . . . that\nis directed toward โ [t]he acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client\nto function with as much self determination and independence as possible;\nand . . . [t]he prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current\noptimal functional status. \n42 C.F.R. ยง 483.440(a).  Choateโs habilitation programs do not meet these\nrequirements and are inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.\nThe failure to provide adequate habilitation programs violates the mandates set\nforth in Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607. \nAs an initial matter, and as noted above, Choate does not conduct cognitive\nassessments of its residents on a regular basis.  Moreover, Choate does not have a \ncoherent method for selecting habilitation learning objectives based on appropriate\nassessments, and functional and relevant objectives are not being targeted.  Our \n\n- 31 -\nconsultant noted that a great number of the training activities at Choate appear to\nbe nonfunctional, occupying individualsโ time but not addressing critical, functional\nobjectives.  Specifically, the training objectives at Choate do not appear to address\nwhether the objective facilitates a smoother and more immediate transition to\ncommunity placement, supports the individualโs independent functioning, or\nimproves the individualโs quality of life.  Similarly, we found PSPs that contained\ninappropriate goals or objectives when considered in conjunction with other\ninformation contained in the PSP.  In particular, we found learning objectives that\nare inappropriate or irrelevant, such as U.U.โs learning objective of identifying his\nmedications, when elsewhere in his PSP it states that he is not currently on any\nmedications.  In other PSPs, we found goals and objectives that contradicted the\nindividualโs stated or expressed preferences and personal goals.  For example, V.V.โs\nPSP reveals that, from December 2006 to March 2007, a four-month period, he was\nin a shaving skills program, but V.V. refused to participate because he wanted to\nkeep his facial hair.  There is no indication in the PSP that the team questioned the\nappropriateness of his placement in the program or considered dropping the\nshaving skills objective.  V.V.โs PSP also notes that he continually refuses to work in\nhis vocational program and has, at times, displayed significant disruptive behaviors\nand โmaladaptive behaviors towards peers.โ  The PSP nevertheless concludes that \nhe is appropriately placed in the program without any apparent consideration of\nalternatives. \nFurthermore, individuals at Choate spend little time in habilitation\nactivities.  According to the daily activity charts for the first 24 days of July 2007, a\nreview of 49 individuals revealed the following: \nโข\t  23 individuals had 10 to 18 days with no activities; \nโข\t  23 individuals had 1 day to 9 days with no activities; and \nโข\t  Only 3 individuals appeared to be involved in activities each of the 24\ndays. \nTraining of such infrequency for persons with learning disabilities is not consistent\nwith the requirement of continuous active treatment so that individuals can\nincrease their independence.  Moreover, of the habilitation activities provided to\nthese individuals, a large percentage are described as โMusic,โ โMovie,โ or\nโNews/Weather.โ  These activities are largely passive, and it is unclear how these\nactivities are designed to meet the habilitation needs of the participating\nindividuals.  For example, data sheets revealed U.U.โs learning objectives for four\nweeks yielded a single data sheet indicating that he had โcorrectly achieved the\ntaskโ (sorting colored paper from white paper), a total of nine times in the month of\nJune.  This suggests that U.U. spends very little time involved in tasks associated \n\n- 32 -\nwith learning objectives that increase his independence.  W.W.โs PSP includes an \nobjective to โdescribe what activities are occurring in a picture,โ but it is unclear\nhow this objective aids W.W. in acquiring skills that support independent\nfunctioning and facilitate transition to community placement.  The failure to \nprovide meaningful habilitation activities on a consistent basis is a substantial\ndeparture from generally accepted professional standards.  Moreover, Choateโs \nfailure to provide adequate active instruction and treatment denies individuals the\nopportunity to increase their independence and makes community placement\ndifficult. \nIn addition, the interdisciplinary team does not address whether the amount\nof training and vocational activity for individuals constitutes adequate active\ntreatment to support an expeditious move to a less restrictive environment,\nincrease independence, and improve quality of life.  Nor are there written protocols\ndescribing the methodology by which the interdisciplinary team should evaluate\nand monitor individualsโ progress on training objectives.  Such analysis is not\nincluded in the development and annual review of the PSP.  For example, T.T.โs\nmonthly review summaries from October 2006 through May 2007 indicate that no\nprogress was made on any skill over the entire eight month period, but there did\nnot appear to be any effort to alter the programs or address the lack of progress in\nany fashion.  Failure to substantively review development and monitor progress\ndeprives individuals of effective treatment and prevents them from achieving\npersonal goals. \nAs discussed in Section II.A.1, supra, a serious deficiency in the PSPs is the\nabsence of a discharge plan.  While Choate identifies barriers to community\nplacement, it does not clearly specify actions the facility should take to overcome\nthose barriers.  Generally accepted standards of practice suggest the focus of\ntreatment in a facility should address the barriers that prevent individuals from\nliving successfully in community settings.  An important part of habilitation is\nlearning and using skills in the environment in which those skills are useful.  This \nis one of the most powerful motivators for skill acquisition, and this often will be in\na community setting.  In fact, generally accepted professional standards of care are\nincreasingly emphasizing use of community settings for skills acquisition.  Choateโs \nlack of active instruction, treatment and training in a community setting, coupled\nwith the absence of a discharge plan, greatly hinders success in this area and\nviolates federal law. \n3.  Communication Services Are Not Adequate \nIf communication skills deteriorate or are not developed, individuals are\nmore likely to be unable to convey basic needs and concerns, are more likely to\nengage in maladaptive behavior as a form of communication, and are more likely to \n\n- 33 -\nbe at risk of bodily injury, unnecessary psychotropic medications, and psychological\nharm from having no means to express needs and wants.  Lack of communication \nskills will also make it more difficult for staff to recognize and diagnose health\nissues, such as pain, and hinders an individualโs ability to move into more\nintegrated settings as required by Olmstead.  Choate fails to provide its residents\nwith adequate and appropriate communication services and currently lacks the\nresources to address this deficiency. \nMore specifically, Choate provides limited speech and language programming\nto residents.  At the time of our visit, we noted a single speech and language\npathologist available for the facility, who is also responsible for speech and\nlanguage services for individuals in the mental health facility.  Without an \nadequate number of full time speech and language pathologists on staff, Choate will\ncontinue to provide poor communication services for individuals with developmental\ndisabilities. \nIn addition, Choateโs interdisciplinary collaboration with respect to\ncommunication and behavior intervention is relatively weak.  Our review suggests\nthat Choate is aware that challenging behaviors can serve as a means of\ncommunication.  This awareness could provide the basis for interdisciplinary\ncollaboration between speech and language services and behavior support services,\nbut we did not find any evidence that this collaboration was occurring.  For \nexample, P.P.โs BIP includes a replacement behavior for inappropriate behaviors\nthat involves prompting him to ask for a break and for preferred items, but his\nlanguage program instead focuses on receptive identification of common objects. \nThe relationship between the objectives in his behavior program and his language\nprogram is unclear, and there is no evidence of collaboration between the two\ndisciplines in producing these plans. \nSimilarly, we also noted the facility serves individuals with hearing\nimpairments, who are dependent on sign language as their primary form of\ncommunication.  However, staff on their units were not proficient in sign language\nor able to communicate effectively with hearing-impaired individuals.  Choateโs \nfailure to provide consistent access to staff with signing expertise denies these\nindividuals their voice, limits their ability and opportunity to express preferences\nand choices, and deprives them of an opportunity to participate in their treatment. \nE. \t Choateโs Special Education Services For Qualified Students Are \nInsufficient \nChoate fails to provide sufficient education services to individuals as required\nby the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (โIDEAโ), 20 U.S.C. ยง 1401 \net seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794, and the \n\n- 34 -\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101, et seq.  Students eligible for\nservices under the IDEA are required to have an Individualized Education Plan\n(โIEPโ), developed by the responsible education agency, and the IEP must be\nimplemented.  20 U.S.C. ยง 1414(d).  The failure to provide adequate education\nservices also impairs individualsโ ability to move to more integrated settings as\nrequired by Olmstead.  527 U.S. at 607. \nDuring our review, we found that certain individuals at Choate, who\nqualified for special education services and had an IEP in place, were not receiving\nthe services required by the IEP.  For example, N.N.'s IEP indicates that Extended \nSchool Year services are needed.  However, the โProgram Scheduleโ for forensic\nresidents updated on July 19, 2007 indicated that N.N. was not receiving any\nspecial education summer services.  The failure to ensure that the services required\nby an individualโs IEP are being implemented violates federal law and departs from\ngenerally accepted professional standards. \nF. \t Supports, Services, and Planning Are Not Integrated \nMany of Choateโs difficulties in providing adequate supports and services to\nits residents stem from the facilityโs failure to ensure that information is\ncommunicated to, and considered by, the disciplines for whom that information is\nrelevant.  Persons with developmental disabilities residing in state institutions\nhave a constitutional right to adequate treatment, training, and medical care,\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 319, 322, that is designed to enable an individual to\nlive in the most integrated setting consistent with their needs, Olmstead, 527 U.S. \nat 607, and a critical aspect of any care and treatment is the integration of\ninformation to obtain a holistic understanding of the individual.  Without a \ncomprehensive understanding of the person, the services provided to that person\nare necessarily deficient.  Choate does not effectively synthesize information about\nthe individuals it serves in its Personal Service Plans, and the interdisciplinary\nteam process at Choate is inadequate. \n1.\t  Personal Service Plans Do Not Meet Generally Accepted Professional\nStandards \nAt Choate, the development of a Personal Service Plan (โPSPโ) is intended to\nintegrate information about an individual across disciplines.  Our review of the \nPSPs, however, revealed that integration of information is not taking place.  The \nPSPs are not a comprehensive summary of and plan for an individualโs treatment at\nChoate.  The โSummary of Last Year and Current Statusโ included in the PSPs,\nwhile extensive, simply collects reports from individual disciplines, but does not\nintegrate the information from those reports.  Moreover, the reports themselves do\nnot reflect collaboration between the disciplines.  One example is the PSP of T.T., \n\n- 35 -\nwhich reports in one section that his challenging behaviors have grown\nsubstantially worse over the past year.  Nevertheless, the PSP does not include any\nchanges to the Behavior Intervention Plan to address the increasing behaviors, and\nit also calls for a further reduction of his psychotropic medication without\naddressing the increasing behaviors.  We found another individual with a Behavior \nIntervention Plan that was not referenced anywhere in his PSP, and thus was not\ntaken into account by other disciplines.  Other examples of lack of integration\ninclude individuals who are taking psychotropic medications but do not have\nbehavioral intervention programs, and individuals who have personal goals listed in\ntheir PSP but have no learning objectives associated with these goals.  The failure \nto integrate information from various disciplines in the PSP undermines the\ntreatment that Choate is attempting to provide and inhibits the ability of Choateโs\nresidents to move to more integrated settings. \nOur review discovered other omissions from PSPs that substantially depart\nfrom generally accepted professional standards.  First, we found that, on the whole, \nPSPs at Choate do not reflect individualized planning.  They do not describe the\nindividualโs goals, and they contain little information about an individualโs personal\npreferences.  Without this information, the PSPs necessarily fail to plan treatment\nthat takes into account the individualโs strengths and preferences, as required by\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Second, we found that the โStrengths\nand Needsโ section of the PSP lacks a social skills section.  This is a troubling\nomission, as one of the primary reasons individuals reside at Choate is their\ninability to relate to others in a socially appropriate manner.  Third, PSPs lack any\nsection devoted to discharge planning.  Generally accepted professional standards\ndictate that a major focus of an individualโs treatment at Choate should be\naddressing the barriers that prevent the individual from living in the community. \nThe failure to require the inclusion of this information in the PSP is a significant\nomission. \nFinally, PSPs are intended to document an individualโs plan of care in\nlanguage that is understandable to the individual served or their guardian.  Indeed, \nthe PSPs at Choate include a specific section entitled โParents/Guardians\nCommentsโ that requires an affirmation by the parent or guardian that he or she\nโunderstands and approves the Personal Service Plan.โ  Despite this affirmation in\nthe PSPs at Choate, we found that the PSPs often contained highly technical\nlanguage and professional jargon that is unlikely to be understood by the\nindividuals or their guardians.  Without informed input from individuals and/or\ntheir guardians, PSPs will not be what they are intended to beโperson-centered. \n\n- 36 -\n2.  Treatment Teams Are Not Integrated \nChoateโs treatment teams are not integrated across disciplines, resulting in\ncare that does not meet the individualsโ needs.  This is a substantial departure from\ngenerally accepted professional standards. \nDuring our visits, we attended numerous monthly review meetings held by\ntreatment teams for individuals at Choate, and they were uniformly characterized\nby a lack of collaboration across disciplines.  Moreover, the summaries of those \nmeetings consistently fail to document an interdisciplinary approach to the\nchallenges an individual presents, as well as any substantive team discussion about\nthose challenges.  For example, O.O. had a target behavior added to his behavior\nintervention plan on January 18, 2007, but the summary of the monthly review\nmeeting for January 2007 does not include any discussion of the behavior or provide\nany rationale for adding it as a target behavior.  V.V.โs monthly review summaries\nfor August through November 2006, a four-month period, contained no evidence\nthat any discussion was taking place by the team regarding his Money Skills and\nVocational Skills programs.  In each of the four summaries, the only included\nlanguage regarding his progress in these programs was:  โHe is currently working\non a money objective.  He will continue to work on this objective.โ and he โis\nworking on a vocational program.  He will continue to work on this program.โ  A \nmore egregious example is that of T.T., who had multiple injuries due to             \nself-injurious behaviors from December 2006 through March 2007.  The injuries\ntriggered four Special Program reviews, but the summaries of the monthly review\nmeetings for January, February, and March 2007 all indicate that the behavior\nprogram โcontinues to meet individualโs needs.โ  The failure to exchange\ninformation adequately and integrate that information into meaningful treatment\nis a substantial, and very significant, departure from generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  Furthermore, without accurate and complete\ndocumentation of the interdisciplinary team process, it is impossible to evaluate\ntreatment teamsโ actions and build upon successful interventions. \nWe also found the monthly review meetings and summaries had several\nsignificant omissions.  One troubling omission was the lack of action plans that\nwere developed through the monthly review process.  None of the monthly review\nmeetings that we attended while at Choate produced any action plans to address an\nindividualโs needs, and the monthly review summaries that we reviewed routinely\nfailed to include any action plans.  A second omission that we observed was the \nfailure to review and discuss restraint data during monthly reviews meetings.  We \nfound several examples where a restraint occurred during the time period for the\nmonthly review, but the monthly review summary did not make any reference to\nthe restraint, nor was there any documentation of whether the team had considered\nwhether changes to the active treatment plan were necessary to prevent the need \n\n- 37 -\nfor further restraints.  A third omission in the monthly review process was a routine\nfailure to address discharge planning and barriers to placement.  The monthly\nreview meetings we attended did not include any substantive discussion of\ndischarge planning or barriers to placement in the community, and the monthly\nreview summaries we reviewed similarly failed to address these issues.  These \nomissions diminish Choateโs ability to provide adequate treatment to its residents. \nChoate also fails to include critical individuals in the interdisciplinary team \nprocess.  We found that direct care staff are not included in team meetings,\nundermining the team process.  Direct care staff provide information based on\ndirect observations of the individual that is critical to effective treatment planning. \nThe failure to involve direct care staff in treatment decisions also undercuts \nChoateโs ability to ensure that consensus is reached on appropriate treatment and\nthat treatment is uniformly implemented.  Additionally, we found that the\nindividuals themselves are not consistently present at monthly review meetings.  At \nleast four individuals - X.X., G.G., Y.Y., and Z.Z. - did not attend their monthly\nreview meetings during our visit.  We do note, and appreciate, that when\nindividuals were present at meetings, effort was made to engage them actively in\ntheir treatment and the individuals were treated with dignity and respect.\nNevertheless, generally accepted professional standards dictate that an individual\nbe actively involved in their treatment planning, and effort should be made to\nensure that individuals are more consistently involved in this process. \nIII.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies and protect the constitutional and\nstatutory rights of Choate residents, the State should promptly implement, at a\nminimum, the remedial measures set forth below.  Many of these deficiencies could\nbe remedied, in part, by focusing the care and treatment at Choate on moving\nindividuals into the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs: \nA. \t Transition and Discharge Planning \n1.\t  Ensure that each individual residing in Choate is served in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to meet each personโs individualized\nneeds.  To this end, the facility should take these steps: \na.\t  Provide transition, discharge, and community placement\nservices consistent with generally accepted professional\nstandards of care to all individuals residing at Choate; \nb.\t  Actively pursue the appropriate discharge of individuals\nresiding at Choate and provide them with adequate and \n\n- 38 -\nappropriate protections, supports, and services, consistent with\neach personโs individualized needs, in the most integrated\nsetting in which they can be reasonably accommodated, and\nwhere the individual does not object; \nc.\t  Set forth in reasonable detail a written transition plan\nspecifying the particular protections, supports, and services that\neach individual will or may need in order to safely and\nsuccessfully transition to and live in the community; \nd.\t  Develop each transition plan using person-centered planning\nprinciples.  Each transition plan should specify with\nparticularity the individualized protections, supports, and\nservices needed to meet the needs and preferences of the\nindividual in the alternative community setting, including their\nscope, frequency, and duration.  Each transition plan should\ninclude all individually-necessary protections, supports, and\nservices, including but not limited to: \ni.\t  housing and residential services; \nii.\t  transportation; \niii.\t  staffing; \niv.\t  health care and other professional services; \nv.\t  specialty health care services; \nvi.\t  therapy services; \nvii.\t  psychological, behavioral, and psychiatric services; \nviii.\t  communication and mobility supports; \nix.\t  programming, vocational, and employment supports; and \nx.\t  assistance with activities of daily living. \ne.\t  Include in each transition plan specific details about which\nparticular community providers, including residential, health\ncare, and program providers, can furnish needed protections,\nservices, and supports; \n\n- 39 -\nf.  Emphasize the placement of residents into smaller community\nhomes in its transition planning; \ng.  Avoid placing residents into nursing homes or other\ninstitutional settings whenever possible in its transition\nplanning; \nh.  Identify in each transition plan the date the transition can\noccur, as well as timeframes for completion of needed steps to\neffect the transition.  Each transition plan should include the\nname of the person or entity responsible for: \ni.  commencing transition planning; \nii.  identifying community providers and other protections,\nsupports, and services; \niii.  connecting the resident with community providers; and \niv.  assisting in transition activities as necessary. \nThe responsible person or entity shall be experienced and\ncapable of performing these functions. \ni.  Develop each transition plan sufficiently prior to potential\ndischarge so as to enable the careful development and\nimplementation of needed actions to occur before, during, and\nafter the transition.  This should include identifying and\novercoming, whenever possible, any barriers to transition.\nChoate should work closely with pertinent community agencies\nso that the protections, supports, and services that the\nindividual needs are developed and in place at the alternate site\nprior to the individualโs discharge; \nj.  Update the transition plans as needed throughout the planning\nand transition process based on new information and/or\ndevelopments; \nk.  Attempt to locate community alternatives in regions based upon\nthe presence of persons significant to the individual, including\nparents, siblings, other relatives, or close friends, where such\nefforts are consistent with the individualโs desires; \n\n- 40 -\nl.\t  Provide as many individual on-site and overnight visits to\nvarious proposed residential placement sites in the community\nas are appropriate and needed to ensure that the placement\nultimately selected is, and will be, adequate and appropriate to\nmeet the needs of each individual.  Choate should modify the\ntransition plans, as needed, based on these community visits; \nm.\t  Establish in each individual transition plan a schedule for\nmonitoring visits to the new residence to assess whether the\nongoing needs of the individual are being met.  Each plan should\nspecify more regular visits in the days and weeks after any\ninitial placement; \nn.\t  Ensure that each individual residing at Choate be involved in\nthe team evaluation, decision-making, and planning process to\nthe maximum extent practicable, using whatever\ncommunication method he or she prefers; \no.\t  Use person-centered planning principles at every stage of the \nprocess.  This should facilitate the identification of the \nindividualโs specific interests, goals, likes and dislikes, abilities\nand strengths, as well as deficits and support needs; \np.\t  Give each individual residing at Choate the opportunity to\nexpress a choice regarding placement.  Choate should provide\nindividuals with choice counseling to help each individual make\nan informed choice and provide enhanced counseling to those\nindividuals who have lived at Choate for many years; \nq.\t  If any individual residing at Choate opposes placement, Choate\nshould document the steps taken to ensure that any individual\nobjection is an informed one.  Choate should set forth and \nimplement individualized strategies to address concerns and\nobjections to placement; \nr.\t  Educate individuals residing at Choate about the community\nand various community living options open to them on a routine\nbasis; \ns.\t  Provide each individual with several viable placement\nalternatives to consider whenever possible.  Choate should \nprovide field trips to these viable community sites and facilitate \n\n- 41 -\novernight stays at certain of the community residences, where\nappropriate; \nt.\t  Provide ongoing educational opportunities to family members\nand/or guardians with regard to placement and programming\nalternatives and options, when family members and/or\nguardians have reservations about community placement.\nThese educational opportunities should include information\nabout how the individual may have viable options other than\nliving with the family members and/or guardians once\ndischarged from Choate.  Choate should identify and address\nthe concerns of family members and/or guardians with regard to\ncommunity placement.  Choate should encourage family\nmembers and/or guardians to participate, whenever possible, in\nindividualsโ on-site, community home field trips; \nu.\t  In coordination with the State, develop and implement a system,\nincluding service coordination services, to effectively monitor\ncommunity-based placements and programs to ensure that they\nare developed in accordance with the individualized transition\nplans set forth above, and that the individuals placed are\nprovided with the protections, services, and supports they need. \nThese and other monitoring and oversight mechanisms should\nserve to help protect individuals from abuse, neglect, and\nmistreatment in their community residential and other \nprograms.  The Stateโs oversight shall include regular\ninspections of community residential and program sites; regular\nface-to-face meetings with residents and staff; and in-depth\nreviews of treatment records, incident/injury data, key-indicator\nperformance data, and other provider records; \nv.\t  Serve individuals who are placed in the community with an\nadequate number of service coordinators to meet individualsโ\nneeds.  The Stateโs service coordination program should provide\nfor various levels of follow-up and intervention, including more\nintensive service coordination for those individuals leaving\nChoate with more complex needs.  To encourage frequent\nindividual contact, individuals leaving Choate should be served\nby service coordinators who carry a caseload of no more than 25\nindividuals at a time.  Service coordinators involved with \nindividuals from Choate with more complex and intensive needs\nwill carry a caseload of no more than 20 individuals at a time. \n\n- 42 -\nAll service coordinators should receive appropriate and adequate\nsupervision and competency-based training; \nw.\t  Provide prompt and effective support and intervention services\npost-placement to residents who present adjustment problems\nrelated to the transition process such that each individual may\nstay in his or her community residence when appropriate, or be\nplaced in a different, adequate, and appropriate community\nsetting as soon as possible.  These services may include, but not\nbe limited to: \ni.\t  providing heightened and enhanced service coordination\nto the individual/home; \nii.\t  providing professional consultation, expert assistance,\ntraining, or other technical assistance to the\nindividual/home; \niii.\t  providing short-term supplemental staffing and/or other\nassistance at the home as long as the problem exists; and \niv.\t  developing and implementing other community\nresidential alternative solutions for the individual. \nx.\t  Regularly review various community providers and programs to\nidentify gaps and weaknesses, as well as areas of highest\ndemand, to provide information for comprehensive planning,\nadministration, resource-targeting, and implementing needed\nremedies.  The State should develop and implement effective\nstrategies to any gaps or weaknesses or issues identified. \nB.\t  Protection From Harm \n1.\t  Provide incident, risk, and quality management services consistent\nwith generally accepted professional standards to all residents at\nChoate.  To this end, the facility should take these steps: \na.\t  Ensure that residents are supervised adequately by trained staff\nand that residents are kept reasonably safe and protected from\nharm and risk of harm; \nb.\t  Develop and implement adequate policies and procedures\nregarding timely and complete incident reporting and the \n\n- 43 -\nconduct of investigations of serious incidents.  Train staff and \ninvestigators fully on how to implement these policies and\nprocedures.  Centrally track and analyze trends of incidents and\ninjuries so as to develop and implement remedial measures that\nwill prevent future events.  Include systemic recommendations\nin investigation reports and ensure the prompt implementation\nof remedial measures to prevent future occurrence of incidents\nand injuries; and \nc.\t  Develop and implement mechanisms to ensure that, when\nserious incidents such as allegations of abuse, neglect, and/or\nserious injury occur, Choate staff take immediate and\nappropriate action to protect the individuals involved, including\nremoving alleged perpetrators from direct contact with\nindividuals pending either the investigationโs outcome or at\nleast a well-supported, preliminary assessment that the\nemployee poses no risk to individuals or the integrity of the\ninvestigation. \n2.\t  Ensure that any device or procedure that restricts, limits, or directs a\nresidentโs freedom of movement (including, but not limited to,\nmechanical restraints, physical or manual restraints, or chemical\nrestraints) be used only in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  To this end, the facility should take the\nfollowing steps: \na.\t  Ensure that restrictive interventions or restraints, including\nseclusion, are never used as punishment, in lieu of training\nprograms, or for the convenience of staff.  Ensure that only the\nleast restrictive restraint techniques necessary are utilized, and\nthat restraint use is minimized; \nb.\t  Develop and implement a protocol that places appropriate limits\non the use of all restraints, especially the use of physical holds\nand one-point, two-point, three-point, four-point, and five-point\nrestraints, as well as the routine use of chemical restraints; and \nc.\t  Ensure that ineffective behavior programs that may contribute\nto the use of restraints are modified or replaced in a timely \nmanner.  For those individuals subjected to chronic use of\nrestraint associated with difficult behavior problems, obtain\noutside expertise to help the facility address the persons' \n\n- 44 -\nbehavior problems in an attempt to reduce both the behaviors\nand the use of restraint. \nC. \t Health and Psychiatric Care \n1.\t  Provide medical care, nursing, and therapy services consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards to residents who need such\nservices.  To this end, the facility should take these steps: \na.\t  Provide each resident with proactive, coordinated, and\ncollaborative health care and therapy planning and treatment\nbased on his or her individualized needs; \nb.\t  Develop and implement an adequate system that ensures\ntimely, accurate, and thorough recording of all medical care\nprovided to each resident including consultation with outside\nmedical providers, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations;\nand \nc.\t  Establish an effective physical and nutritional management\nprogram for residents who are at risk for aspiration  or\ndysphagia, including but not limited to the development and\nimplementation of assessments, risk assessments, interventions\nfor mealtimes and other activities involving swallowing, and\nmonitoring to ensure that interventions are effective.  Ensure \nthat staff with responsibilities for residents at risk for aspiration\nand dysphagia have successfully completed competency-based\ntraining commensurate with their responsibilities. \n2.\t  Provide psychiatric services consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards to residents who need such services.  To this \nend, the facility should take these steps: \na.\t  Ensure that each resident with mental illness is provided with a\ncomprehensive psychiatric assessment, a DSM-IV diagnosis,\nappropriate psychiatric treatment including appropriate\nmedication at the minimum effective dose that fits the \ndiagnosis, and regular and ongoing monitoring of psychiatric\ntreatments to ensure that it is meeting the needs of each person.\nEnsure that psychiatrist(s) provide new assessments and/or\nrevisions to any aspect of the treatment regimen whenever\nappropriate.  Ensure that quality behavioral and other data is\nprovided to psychiatrists in making their assessments.  Ensure \n\n- 45 -\nthat psychiatric services are implemented in close collaboration\nwith facility psychologists and others such, when warranted, to\nprovide coordinated behavioral care; and \nb.\t  Ensure that psychotropic medication is only used in accordance\nwith generally accepted professional standards and that it is not\nused for punishment, in lieu of a training program, for behavior\ncontrol, in lieu of a psychiatric or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, or\nfor the convenience of staff.  Ensure that no resident receives \npsychotropic medication without an accompanying behavior \nprogram. \nD.\t  Behavioral, Habilitation, and Communication Services \n1.\t  Provide residents with training, including behavioral and habilitative\nservices, consistent with generally accepted professional standards to\nresidents who need such services.  These services should be developed\nby qualified professionals consistent with accepted professional\nstandards to reduce or eliminate risks to personal safety, to reduce or\neliminate unreasonable use of bodily restraints, to prevent regression,\nand to facilitate the growth, development, and independence of every\nresident.  To this end, the facility should take the following steps: \na.\t  Procure adequate psychology staffing and hours to meet the\nneeds of the residents, including adequate leadership and\noversight of psychological services; \nb.\t  Provide residents who have behavior problems with an adequate\nfunctional assessment so as to determine the appropriate\ntreatments and interventions for each person.  Ensure that this \nassessment is interdisciplinary and incorporates medical and\nother unaddressed conditions that may contribute to a resident's\nbehavior; \nc.\t  Develop and implement comprehensive, individualized behavior\nprograms for the residents who need them.  Through\ncompetency-based training, train the appropriate staff how to\nimplement the behavior programs and ensure that they are\nimplemented consistently and effectively.  Record appropriate\nbehavioral data and notes with regard to the resident's progress\non the programs; \n\n- 46 -\nd.\t  Monitor adequately the residents' progress on the programs and\nrevise the programs when necessary to ensure that residents'\nbehavioral needs are being met.  Provide ongoing training for\nstaff whenever a revision is required; \ne.\t  Ensure that all residents receive meaningful habilitation daily.\nEnsure that there is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary\nhabilitative plan for each resident for the provision of such\ntraining, services and supports, formulated by a qualified\ninterdisciplinary team that identifies individuals' strengths,\nneeds, preferences, and interests.  Ensure that the plans\naddress the residents' needs, preferences, and interests in an\nintegrated fashion that utilizes the individuals' existing\nstrengths.  Ensure that staff are trained in how to implement\nthe written plans and that the plans are implemented properly;\nand \nf.\t  Provide an assessment of all residents and develop and\nimplement plans based on these assessments to ensure that\nresidents are receiving vocational and/or day programming\nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet their\nneeds.  Ensure that there is sufficient staffing and\ntransportation to enable residents to work off campus or attend\noff-campus programming or activities when necessary. \n2.\t  Provide communication services consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards to residents who need such services.  To this \nend, the facility should take these steps: \na.\t  Procure adequate staffing and hours of speech and language\nservices to meet the needs of residents; and \nb.\t  Ensure that speech and language services are developed and\nimplemented in collaboration with facility psychologists and\nother services to provide coordinated care. \nE. \t Special Education Services \n1.\t  Provide education and special education services consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards to residents who need such\nservices.  To this end, the facility should develop and implement IEPs\nconsistent with the requirements of the IDEA. \n\n- 47 -\nF. \t Integrated Supports, Services, and Planning \n1.\t  Provide supports, services, and planning that are integrated across\ndisciplines, consistent with generally accepted professional standards,\nto all residents at Choate.  To this end, the facility should take these \nsteps: \na.\t  Ensure that PSPs integrate information across disciplines and\nreflect collaboration among disciplines.  Ensure that PSPs \ndemonstrate individualized planning, including the individualโs\nneeds, strengths, goals, and preferences.  Develop and\nimplement PSPs that include a section on transition and\ndischarge planning, including the barriers to community\nplacement and the facilityโs plan to address those barriers.\nEnsure that PSPs are understandable to the individual served \nor their guardian; and \nb.\t  Ensure that interdisciplinary and treatment team meetings\nintegrate information across disciplines and reflect collaboration\nbetween disciplines, and that the integration and collaboration\nis appropriately documented.  Ensure that individuals necessary\nto obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the resident,\nincluding direct care staff and the individual who is the subject\nof the meeting or their guardian, are included in the\ninterdisciplinary team process.  Ensure that action plans are\ndeveloped and implemented to address the needs and/or issues\nidentified in those meetings, including but not limited to\ninappropriate behaviors or use of restraint.  Ensure that \ntransition and discharge planning, including barriers to\nplacement, are routinely discussed at team meetings. \n\n- 48 -\nIV.

Howe\nDevelopmental Center,\nDefendants.\nCONSENT DECREE\nIntroduction\n1.  This case was instituted by the United States on January\n28, 1992, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1997 et seq.\n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. Section 1345.\n3.  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section\n1391(b).\n4.  The United States is authorized to institute this civil\naction by 42 U.S.C. Section 1997a and has met all the\nprerequisites for the institution of this civil action prescribed\nby the statute.\n5.  The defendants are the State of Illinois; the Honorable\nJames R. Edgar, Governor of the State of Illinois; Jess McDonald,\nDirector, Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental\n\nDisabilities (\"DMHDD\"); and Kathleen A. Muniz, Superintendent,\nW.A. Howe Developmental Center (\"Howe\"); who are sued in their\nrespective official capacities.\n6.  The individual defendants who are officers of the\nExecutive Branch of the State of Illinois have authority and\nresponsibility for the operation of Howe.\n7.  On April 18, 1986, the Attorney General of the United\nStates, through the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights\nDivision, notified the Governor of Illinois, the Illinois Attorney\nGeneral, and the Director of DMHDD of his intent to investigate\nallegations of unconstitutional conditions at Howe pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C.

Any violation of provisions of this Consent Decree does\nnot create a private right of action.  This Consent Decree is\nenforceable only by the parties.\n12.  The provisions of this Consent Decree are a lawful, fair\nand reasonable resolution of this case.\n13.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - RFK \nWashington, DC  20530 \nNovember 9, 2009 \nThe Honorable Pat Quinn \nGovernor \nOffice of the Governor \n207 State House \nSpringfield, Illinois  62706 \nRe:\t  Investigation of the W.A. Howe Developmental Center, \n\nTinley Park, Illinois \n\nDear Governor Quinn: \nWe are writing to report the findings of the investigation of the Civil Rights\nDivision and the United States Attorneyโs Office for the Northern District of Illinois\nof conditions and practices at the W.A. Howe Developmental Center (โHoweโ), in\nTinley Park, Illinois.  On July 25, 2007, we notified you of our intent to conduct an\ninvestigation of Howe pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\n(โCRIPAโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997.  CRIPA authorizes the Department of Justice to seek\nremedies for any pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or\nfederal statutory rights of persons with developmental disabilities who are served\nin public institutions. \nOn December 3-7, 2007, we conducted an on-site review of care and \ntreatment at Howe with expert consultants in various disciplines.  Before, during,\nand after our tour, we reviewed a wide variety of relevant State and facility\ndocuments, including policies and procedures, as well as medical and other records\nrelating to the care and treatment of Howe residents.  During our tour, we also\ninterviewed Howe administrators, professionals, staff, and consultants, and visited\nresidents in their residences, at activity areas, and during meals.  In keeping with\nour pledge of transparency and to provide technical assistance, where appropriate,\nwe conveyed our preliminary findings to State counsel and to certain State and\nfacility administrators and staff during exit presentations at the close of our on-site \nreview. \n\n- 2 -\nWe would like to express our appreciation to Howe administrators,\nprofessionals, and staff, as well as to the State officials involved in our\ninvestigation, for their assistance, cooperation, professionalism, and courtesy\nthroughout our investigation.  We hope to continue to work with the State and\nHowe officials in the same cooperative manner going forward. \nWe have concluded that numerous conditions and practices at Howe violate\nthe constitutional and federal statutory rights of its residents.  Many of the findings\nwe make in this letter are due to or exacerbated by Howeโs failure to focus its\ntreatment and care on moving individuals into the most integrated settings\nappropriate to their needs.  In particular, we find that Howe fails to provide its\nresidents with adequate:  (1) protection from harm; (2) health care; (3) psychiatric\ncare; (4) behavioral treatment and habilitation; (5) integrated treatment planning;\nand (6) transition planning and placement in the most integrated setting.  See \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483, Subpart I (Medicaid Program Provisions);\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (โADAโ); 42 U.S.C. ยง 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. ยง\n35.130(d); see also Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \nWe are aware that, on September 5, 2008, the State announced its intention\nto close Howe by June 30, 2009.  We are furthermore aware that the State \ntemporarily halted closure planning earlier this year, before announcing on August\n28, 2009, its final decision to close Howe, and to complete all resident transitions by\nApril 2010.  While the Department of Justice acknowledges the Stateโs closure\ndeliberations and decision, the purpose of this letter is advise you formally, in\naccordance with CRIPA, of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting\nthem, and the minimum remedial measures necessary to remedy the deficiencies\nset forth below.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997b(a).  Even as the closure of Howe proceeds, the\nconstitutional violations at the facility will have continuing effects, for which the\nState must provide relief in whatever setting a Howe resident eventually resides. \nAs it closes Howe, the State retains a statutory obligation to move the facilityโs\nresidents to the most integrated setting appropriate for them as individuals. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nLocated in Tinley Park, Illinois, approximately 30 miles outside of Chicago,\nHowe is a licensed 500-bed intermediate care facility for individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  Howe is one of nine residential developmental centers\noperated by the Illinois Department of Human Services.  At the time of our tour in \nDecember 2007, Howe housed 349 adult residents.  The Howe campus consists of 40\nresidential group homes, 35 of which were occupied during our tour.  Most of the \ngroup homes housed between 8 and 11 individuals.  The campus also includes an \n\n- 3 -\nadministration building, a professional services building, and a social habilitation\nbuilding. \nIn 2006, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesโ Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (โCMSโ) placed Howe in โimmediate jeopardyโ of\nlosing Medicaid certification due to serious deficiencies identified at the facility by\nCMS surveyors.1  In 2007, prior to our investigation, CMS terminated Howeโs\nMedicaid contract.  At the time of the termination, Medicaid funding provided\napproximately one-half of Howeโs $53 million annual budget.  To date, Howe \nremains decertified. \nIn addition to the deficiencies identified by CMS, several prominent\nstatewide disability advocacy organizations in Illinois expressed concern over the\nquality of care provided to the residents at Howe.  These organizations routinely\ncited to a number of resident deaths during 2005-2007, alleging substandard care as\na contributing factor to those deaths.  At the time we notified the State in July 2007\nof our investigation, at least fourteen residents had died in the previous 18 months.\nSince our tour in December 2007, sixteen more residents have died. \nThis is the second CRIPA investigation of Howe undertaken by the\nDepartment of Justice.  In 1992, after a multi-year investigation of Howe, we\nentered into a consent decree with the State of Illinois regarding necessary\nimprovements to the facility.  The consent decree, filed in the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois, specifically required Howe to make\nimprovements in the areas of resident assessment, evaluation, and training; use of\nrestraints; medical care; medication administration; record keeping; and staffing. \nIn 1996, we stipulated to an agreed order to terminate the consent decree and\ndismiss the case.  Unfortunately, we received substantial allegations of new or\ncontinuing violations and therefore, as noted above, opened a new CRIPA\ninvestigation in 2007.  This letter provides our findings from the current\ninvestigation. \nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  TRANSITION PLANNING \nFederal law requires that a state actively pursue the timely discharge of\ninstitutionalized residents to the most integrated, appropriate setting that is\nconsistent with the residentโs needs.  Howe is failing to place residents in the most \n1   CMS surveys are conducted by a designated State Survey Agency\n(โSSAโ).  The SSA in Illinois is the Illinois Department of Public Health (โIDPHโ). \n\n- 4 -\nintegrated setting appropriate to their individual needs, in violation of Title II of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (โADAโ), and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder.  In construing the anti-discrimination provision contained in Title II of\nthe ADA, the Supreme Court has held that โ[u]njustified [institutional] isolation . . .\nis properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.โ  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 \nU.S. 581, 597, 600 (1999).  Specifically, the Court established that states are\nrequired to provide community-based services and supports for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities when the stateโs treatment professionals have\ndetermined that community placement is appropriate, provided that the transfer is\nnot opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably\naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the state and the\nneeds of others with disabilities.  Id. at 602, 607. \nSuccessful transition of residents into a more integrated setting is a\nfundamental obligation of an institution such as Howe.  Howeโs failure to meet this \nobligation is caused in part by the breakdowns in care noted in the below sections of\nthis letter.  The Stateโs decision to close Howe does not relieve the State from its \nobligation to provide federally mandated adequate transition planning.  To the \ncontrary, the Stateโs decision to close Howe intensifies the facilityโs poor record of\nsuccessful transitions.  Howeโs deficiencies detailed below โ to protect residents\nfrom harm (section B), provide adequate health care (section C), psychiatric care\n(section D), behavioral treatment and habilitation (section E), and integrated\ntreatment planning (section F) โ all hinder the residentsโ opportunities to live in a\nmore integrated setting and unnecessarily prolong institutionalization. \nThe result of Howeโs failure to move residents to community placements is to\ndeprive residents of the most integrated appropriate treatment setting, to\nexacerbate challenging behaviors, and to foster institutionalized behaviors and\nattitudes.  Among the staff at Howe, we observed a culture that accepts movement\ntoward community placements at a glacial pace.  Often there is no movement at all. \nTransition to community placement, when considered, is viewed as a distant\npossibility. \nOf the residents present at Howe for some portion of the period between\nSeptember 1, 2006, and September 30, 2007, only 80 residents were recommended\nfor placement by their treatment team.  Although persons with disabilities can live\nin community-based settings with proper supports, fewer than one-fourth of the\nindividuals at Howe were recommended for community placement by their \ntreatment team.  During this same 13-month period, only 32 residents\n(approximately 9% of the census at the time of our tour) were discharged to\ncommunity placements.  This rate of community placement is low and results in a\nlarge number of individuals remaining at the facility for long periods of time. \n\n- 5 -\nFor example, B.L., a resident who has no challenging behaviors, no\npsychiatric symptoms, can dress herself, complete all morning grooming, eating,\nand bedmaking activities before leaving for her workshop placement, and has few\nhealth problems, was not referred to any community agencies in the past year.  This \nfailure clearly maintains B.L. in an overly restrictive setting and deprives her of\nmeaningful choices about where to live. \nAccording to Howeโs list entitled, โPeople Recommended for Community\nPlacement by Treatment Team - 9/1/06 - 9/30/07,โ residents recommended for\nplacement in the community in 2004 still have not been placed.  Of residents who \nhave requested community placement, some have remained at Howe even longer,\ndespite evidence that there is no serious obstacle to such movement.  For example,\nB.M., whose โone issue is his anger,โ had anger management replacement behavior\nconsistently above 90 percent and, at times 100 percent, for the last 11 of 14\nmonths.  Although there is also a note about B.M. having mobility problems, B.M.โs\nISP does not even address steps toward community placement. \nStaff at Howe hold incorrect beliefs as to prerequisites for community living,\nwhich further restricts residentsโ progress toward living in a less restrictive setting. \nFor example, staff expressed to our expert consultant the belief that residents\nneeded to be successful in a community day program before actively pursuing\ncommunity living.  Further, staff consider success in the development of social,\nvocational, and basic living skills to be requirements for community placements,\nwhich they are not.  Those skills increase residentsโ options for living in the\ncommunity, but social deficits, vocational deficits, and basic living deficits are not\ninherently barriers to community living.  Staff also expressed the belief that a\nfailure to develop certain skills necessitates postponing target dates for placement\nby a matter of years.  For example, A.A.โs Qualitative Monthly Review Summary\nacknowledges that he has the goal of moving into a community placement, but\nstates that โat the pace he is going[,] the target dates may need to go up a few \nyears.โ  (Emphasis added). \nAs barriers to placement are not identified in ISPs, and there are no goals\naimed at overcoming those barriers, the transition process is simply not a focus for\nstaff.  Where goals regarding placement are included, they are vaguely stated and\nmonitoring information is obscure.  Sometimes the goals rely on external agencies\nor outside persons to move the process forward.  For example, C.P.โs ISP states that\nher goal of moving to a community-based residence was not met โdue to guardianโs\nlack of interest and knowledge to seek placement at this time.โ \nTransition plans, when generated at all, come too late and lack sufficient\ninformation to generate useful, proactive planning.  Too often, the section entitled, \nโWhat will make this person successful in community living environment?โ is blank. \n\n- 6 -\nTransition plans are not included in residentsโ records, so they are not readily\navailable to the treatment team. \nWe did note that, once a resident is referred, the process becomes more\nproactive and effective.  This was evidenced by the fact that, at the time of our tour,\nplacements had increased.  Nevertheless, Howe residents are institutionalized far \nlonger than necessary due to deficient transition planning.  This deficiency is of\ngreat concern as Howe proceeds with closure plans and transitions residents to new\nsettings. \nB.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that persons with developmental\ndisabilities who reside in state-operated institutions have a โconstitutionally\nprotected liberty interest in safety.โ  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 318. \nTherefore, as the Court explained, the state โhas the unquestioned duty to provide\nreasonable safety for all residentsโ within the institution.  Id. at 324.  In our \njudgment, the State of Illinois fails to protect Howe residents from harm and risk of\nharm, and to provide residents with a reasonably safe living environment.  Failure \nto provide a reasonably safe living environment undermines the other care and\ntreatment provided at Howe, prolongs the time periods spent by individuals there,\nand delays the movement of individuals to more integrated settings in violation of\nOlmstead. \nGenerally accepted professional standards to protect persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities from harm in an institutional setting, which are\nnecessary to prevent constitutional violations, utilize a two-pronged approach:  (1)\nidentifying and responding quickly to occurrences of harm by collecting pertinent\ninformation, and (2) implementing affirmative measures to effectively manage the\nrisk of future occurrences of harm.  The processes of responding to and preventing\nharm are generally understood as โincident managementโ and โrisk managementโ\nrespectively. \n1.  Incident and Risk Management \nThe term โincident managementโ can be understood as the immediate\nresponses taken by the facility when an individual has incurred actual harm or\nwherein the proclivity for such harm is real and/or imminent.  Although Howe\nmaintains an Incident Management Committee to review reportable incidents and\ninjuries, as explained in further detail below, individuals at Howe are at significant\nrisk of harm and injury due to the facilityโs ineffective incident management. \n\n- 7 -\nAdditionally, generally accepted professional standards for facilities like\nHowe require implementation of a risk management system that identifies an\nindividualโs risks of harm and develops preventative interventions through skill\nacquisition, environmental changes, and therapeutic interventions.\nInterdisciplinary treatment teams must thoroughly assess residents to determine\nindividual risks and develop effective strategic interventions to reduce risk. \nMoreover, facilities must utilize objective data to measure the success of the\nstrategic interventions in preventing harm, and when necessary modify the\ninterventions to improve outcomes. \nWe find that Howeโs risk management practices do not provide the level of\nprotection necessary to reasonably prevent harm, substantially depart from\ngenerally accepted professional standards, and consequently fail to meet\nconstitutional and federal standards.  Howe residents continue to be at significant\nrisk of harm and injury due to the facilityโs absent or ineffective responses to\nongoing harm.  Below, we discuss three areas of incident and risk management:  (1)\nreportable incidents and injuries; (2) risk assessment and intervention; and (3)\nabuse and neglect investigations. \na.  Reportable Incidents and Injuries \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that facilities like Howe\nmaintain a reporting system to identify all reportable incidents and injuries\naccurately and responsibly.  A โreportableโ incident will commonly include incidents\nsuch as falls, peer aggression, accidents, restraints, self-injurious behaviors,\ninjuries of unknown origin, and abuse and neglect allegations. \nTo its credit, Howeโs criteria for collecting reportable incident information\nappears to align with generally acceptable standards.  Howeโs procedures for\nactually reporting and reviewing these incidents, however, substantially depart\nfrom those standards.  Indeed, the procedures have not been revised for nearly 20 \nyears.  More troubling than the procedures being simply outdated is our finding\nthat there are significant inconsistencies in the staffโs adherence to the procedures.\nThese inconsistencies result in under-reporting of reportable incidents, which in\nturn, results in insufficient responses to occurrences of harm.  \nDespite the evidence of under-reporting, the number of reportable incidents\nat Howe is disturbing.  For example, for the period of September 2006 through\nSeptember 2007, Howe reported nearly 3,000 incidents, including 8 deaths and\nmore than 100 allegations of abuse and neglect.  Many of these incidents describe\nharm suffered by individual residents that could have been avoided had the facility\ntaken preventive measures to manage the risk of harm. \n\n- 8 -\nOur expert consultant concluded that among the types of reportable\nincidents, aggression and assault are โrampantโ at Howe.  From September 2006 to\nSeptember 2007, more than 150 individuals โ about half of all residents at the\nfacility โ were assaulted by their peers.  The injuries suffered as a result of these\naggressive incidents included:  scratches, abrasions, human bites, head trauma, and \nin more than 20 instances, lacerations that required the use of staples, sutures, or\nDermabond2 to close the wounds.  Human bites alone account for 25 percent of all\naggressive incidents at Howe, a trend that our expert consultant found to be\nโstaggeringโ in comparison with other institutions with similar populations.  \nOther notable examples of reportable incidents of harm during the period of\nSeptember 2006 through September 2007 included residents who suffer from pica3 \nsuccessfully obtaining and ingesting foreign objects such as mechanical restraint\ndevices, plastic bags, keys, metal coils, and puzzle pieces, as well as some 22\nindividuals who reportedly sustained fractures, including one resident who suffered\nthree fractures, and three residents who had two fractures. \nMany Howe residents suffered significant personal injury during the\noccurrences of reportable incidents of harm.  For example: \nโข \t In June 2007, A.A.4 displayed increasingly intense aggressive behavior\nuntil he punched through a window with his hand and arm.  He \nrequired 23 sutures at the local emergency room to close the wound. \nโข\t  In July 2007, when a Howe physician referred B.B. to the local hospital\ndue to her coughing and respiratory distress, x-rays identified three rib\nfractures.  Investigators concluded that she may have suffered the\nfractures when she tripped over a misplaced chair the previous day.\nAt the time of the fall, however, staff reported only that her foot was \nsore. \n2   Dermabond is the brand name of a liquid bonding agent used as an\nalternative to stitches for closing wounds. \n3  Pica is a medical condition in which a person ingests or attempts to\ningest nonfood substances such as clay, chalk, hair, or glue. \n4   To protect the identity of residents, we use coded initials throughout\nthis letter.  We will transmit separately a schedule cross-referencing the coded\ninitials with the actual names of the residents. \n\n- 9 -\nโข\t  Similarly, in October 2007, staff found C.C. with significant bruising\non her shoulder and back, and reported that she โmay have fallen from\nher bed or chair.โ  Twenty-two hours later, a Howe physician examined\nC.C. and sent her to the local hospital for x-rays.  There, the \nemergency room physician diagnosed a fractured clavicle, and reported\nthe matter to the Illinois State Police because the physician concluded\nthat it was hard to believe that her injury came from a fall. \nAlarmingly, 7 of the 10 most frequently injured residents had been assigned\nintensive staffing at the time of their injuries.  The intervention strategy of\nassigning enhanced individual supervision for a time after injuries occur, as we saw\nat Howe, is often ineffective to ensure residentsโ daily safety.  For example, during\nthe period of September 2006 through September 2007: \nโข\t  Tragically, D.D. suffered significant injuries while on 1:1 supervision,5 \nprior to his unexpected death in April 2007.  These injuries included\nmultiple lacerations requiring 40 sutures, injuries to his face and head,\nhuman bites to his chest, and an abrasion to his penis requiring\nclosure with Dermabond.  When the frequency of harm to D.D.\nescalated in late 2006, strategies to protect him remained relatively\nunchanged.  His record reflects that substantive changes were limited\nto psychoactive medication adjustments and the cancellation of his\ndaily program schedule. \nโข\t  E.E. suffered 37 injuries while on 1:1 supervision, including a fracture\nin September 2006, and lacerations requiring Dermabond on January\n19, January 26, and February 23, 2007. \nโข\t  F.F. injured himself on at least 40 separate occasions while on\nintensive supervision during the one-year period examined.  Some \ninjuries were so severe as to require treatment at a hospital, including\nthe need for sutures or Dermabond on at least four occasions. \nโข\t  G.G. had an intensive staffing assignment during the one-year period\nreviewed until her unexpected death in November 2007.  Yet during\nthis time, G.G. sustained at least 25 injuries, including two self-\ninflicted lacerations requiring closure by Dermabond. \n5   The term โ1:1 supervisionโ refers to a heightened level of supervision\nin which the facility will order a staff person to continually supervise one particular\nresident. \n\n- 10 -\nโข\t  Similarly, H.H. was placed on 1:1 supervision in November 2001 due to\nher unsteady gait and risk of falling.  Yet from September 2006\nthrough November 2007, H.H. suffered 28 injuries, including two\nlacerations in July 2007 requiring closure by Dermabond. \nโข\t  I.I. was placed on 1:1 supervision nearly 10 years ago to prevent him\nfrom intentionally harming himself.  Despite the heightened\nsupervision level, I.I. caused injury to himself 13 times in the one-year\nperiod examined. \nIn addition to the reportable incidents identified by Howe,  we are concerned, \nas stated above, about the problem of under-reporting of incidents of harm.  Howe \ndoes not have a firm grasp on the actual numbers of reportable incidents, injuries,\nand uses of restraints6 at the facility.  The pervasive (and self-admitted) under-\nreporting of incidents of harm at Howe minimizes the extent of the actual harm\noccurring, which in turn results in insufficient responses to the occurrences of harm\nto residents.  In a review of Acute Care Logs for just one week, we found more than\ntwenty instances of injury to residents that were treated by medical staff but had\nnot been reported on either the individualโs injury history or the facilityโs aggregate\ninjury totals.  These omissions included serious injuries such as head injuries,\nfractures, and lacerations requiring sutures and staples. \nCompilation of accurate information regarding occurrences of harm is a\ncritical first step in maintaining an adequate incident management system.  On the \nbasis of our examination, Howe falls substantially short of accepted standards of\npractice in reporting incidents and compiling data regarding resident harm.  This \ndereliction has contributed to violations of residentsโ constitutional rights. \nb. \t Risk Assessment and Intervention \nHowe has not implemented policies or procedures to identify and reduce risk\nof harm to residents.  The Risk Management Committee, Howeโs primary vehicle\nfor managing risk, does not address resident risks from a systemic standpoint. \nRather, the committee limits its focus to strategies to reduce enhanced staffing\nassignments to individuals currently assigned intensive staffing.  Our expert\nconsultant found that โfor all intents and purposes, [Howe] had no formal risk\nmanagement system as late as December 2007.โ \n6   The use of restraints at Howe is discussed below in section II.D.2 of \nthis letter. \n\n- 11 -\nEffective risk management requires that assessments and intervention\nstrategies be taken prior to harm whenever possible, yet Howe only identifies\nresidents at risk of harm after the occurrence of actual harm.  This practice\nunderscores Howeโs lack of prevention efforts, which leads to constitutionally\ninadequate protection of residents. \nAlthough Howe has identified some residents at risk of harm, even if that\nidentification only happened after the actual occurrence of harm, Howe fails to\nidentify residents at risk of harming others.  In some cases, Howe has failed to \nidentify such residents even after the occurrence of actual harm.  The following\nresidents, among many others, were not identified as being at risk of harming\nothers despite the serious and recurring injuries they inflicted on their peers: \nโข\t  J.J. injured peers on four occasions between October 2006 and August\n2007.  When J.J. pushed K.K. out of her wheelchair, she caused K.K. to\nfracture her maxillary spine.  Three days after the incident with K.K., \nJ.J. struck and injured L.L. \nโข\t  M.M. assaulted N.N. in October and December 2006, and January\n2007.  The latter assault caused N.N. a laceration deep enough to\nrequire sutures. \nโข\t  O.O. injured five peers on six separate occasions from November 2006\nto June 2007, including an assault on P.P., and a laceration to Q.Q.\nrequiring sutures. \nโข\t  From October 2006 through July 2007, R.R. attacked and injured S.S.\nfour times, and injured three other peers at least once. \nโข\t  T.T. injured seven different individuals, causing bite wounds on at\nleast two occasions, during the one-year period of September 2006\nthrough September 2007. \nโข\t  In November 2006, U.U. assaulted V.V., causing a laceration requiring\nsutures to close.  The following month, U.U. assaulted W.W., causing a\nlaceration that required staples to close. \nHoweโs failure to provide adequate intervention to address residentsโ aggressive\nbehaviors places residents at continued risk of serious harm and substantially\ndeparts from generally accepted professional standards. \nAdditionally, although we note that Howe opened a special residence to safely\nhouse women with pica just prior to our tour in December 2007, many ingestion \n\n- 12 -\nhazards remained evident, including metal shower curtain rings, dried and plastic\nflowers, and stereo speaker wires.  Though preventive measures at this residence\nare a good starting point, additional steps must be implemented to reduce\nopportunities to engage in pica. \nc.  Abuse and Neglect Investigations \n  Based on extensive record and mortality reviews, we find that abuse and\nneglect of residents is pervasive at Howe.  This conclusion is consistent with the \nfindings of CMS and the Stateโs protection and advocacy organization.  The facility\ninvestigated approximately 100 allegations of abuse and neglect in the year ending\nin September 2007.  Nearly 75 percent of those incidents alleged physical or sexual\nabuse.  Based on our review, Howeโs system to investigate alleged harm is not\nsufficient to hold accountable those who engage in abuse and neglect, and thus\npromotes constitutional violations. \nGenerally accepted professional standards for investigative practices require\nthat investigations be timely, thorough, and logical.  The extent to which an \ninvestigation is thorough is measured in part by the degree to which the\ninvestigator probes for answers, researches facility documents, and challenges\ndiscrepant accounts of events.  This includes gathering all relevant evidence, and\ninterviewing and re-interviewing witnesses.  Logical investigative conclusions are\nreached when the investigator is able to apply critical thinking to the information\nhe or she has gathered, and synthesize that information into a coherent report. \nThe overall quality of Howeโs investigations falls substantially below\ngenerally accepted professional standards because investigations fail to reach\nlogical, well-reasoned conclusions.  In some instances, the investigative files were in\nsuch disarray that it was difficult, if not impossible, to discern the process and\noutcome of the investigation.  The disorganized manner in which the investigative\nrecords are maintained at Howe reflects the disorganized and incomplete quality of\nthe investigations themselves. \nOf the 100 abuse and neglect investigations Howe initiated7 from September\n2006 to September 2007, only six were substantiated, while the outcomes of 43\nothers were not indicated on facility reports.  The two examples presented below \n7  Illinoisโ Office of Inspector General (โOIGโ) also conducts\ninvestigations of alleged abuse and neglect at state-operated facilities for\nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  We do not address those investigations\nin this Findings Letter. \n\n- 13 -\nfrom the period examined illustrate Howeโs lack of thoroughness in conducting\nabuse and neglect investigations: \nโข\t  The investigation of X.X.โs sudden death in July 2007 revealed that\ntwo attending staff members failed to provide cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (โCPRโ) after finding X.X. unresponsive in his bed\nbecause the staff members simply โdid not think to do it.โ  Reportedly,\nwhen a staff member found X.X. unresponsive, lying face down in his\nbed, she unsuccessfully attempted to wake him.  She then allegedly\nyelled for another staff member to call an emergency code.  Reportedly,\ninstead of immediately calling the code, the staff member ran to the\nroom and attempted to wake X.X. without success.  The staff member \nthen allegedly reported the incident to the facility operator, who in\nturn paged the nurse.  When one of the staff members later told the \ninvestigator that she had tried to obtain a CPR facial mask for X.X.,\nthe investigator did not probe further to find out why she was looking\nfor a CPR mask when she stated previously that she โdid not thinkโ to\ninitiate CPR.  The lack of critical thinking applied during this\ninvestigation may have exonerated staff negligence that may have\ncontributed to X.X.โs death.  More troubling, we found evidence in this\nmatter that indicated Howe records may have been falsified, because\nbed check notes for X.X. were entered after he went to the local \nhospital.  The administrative review of the investigation does not\nindicate that document falsification was identified or addressed. \nโข\t  The investigation of alleged verbal abuse by a staff member, who was\nwatching television while on duty, had obvious flaws.  In October 2007, \ntwo family members were in a residence retrieving the personal\nbelongings of their brother who had recently died.  When entering the\nhome the family members allegedly saw a staff member sitting alone\nin the living room watching television.  Reportedly, while in the\nbrotherโs room, the family members heard the staff member verbally\nabuse a resident in an effort to make the resident stop what he was\ndoing and sit down.  The investigators of this incident, however, failed\nto interview the alleged victim, other residents in the area at the time\nof the alleged abuse, or the alleged perpetratorโs peers or supervisors.\nMoreover, the investigation failed to address why a staff member was\nsitting alone watching television while she was on duty.  After the \nalleged perpetrator simply denied the allegation and a second\nemployee denied hearing anything at all, Howe investigators\ndetermined that there was insufficient evidence to support the\nallegation and closed the investigation. \n \n\n- 14 -\nBased on our review of Howe investigations over a twelve-month period, we\nfind that Howeโs inadequate investigative practices must improve significantly to\nmeet the constitutional rights of the individuals who live at Howe. \n2.  Quality and Records Management \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that a facility like Howe\ndevelop and maintain an integrated system to monitor and ensure quality of care\nacross all aspects of care and treatment.  An effective quality management program\nmust incorporate adequate systems for data capture, retrieval, and statistical\nanalysis to identify and track trends.  The program should also include a process for\nmonitoring the effectiveness of corrective actions taken in response to problems that\nare discovered. \nAdditionally, generally accepted professional standards in record\ndocumentation require that an institutionโs official record be an accurate and\nthorough account of the care of the resident, allowing access to the individualโs most\ncurrent medical, behavioral, social, and habilitative information.  Failure to keep\nthe record in a timely, organized fashion compromises the integrity of the record\nand provides an opportunity for erroneous clinical decision-making by treatment \nteams. \na.  Quality Management \nHowe substantially departs from generally accepted quality management\nstandards.  Howe conducts a biannual injury analysis that is largely dependent\nupon staff providing timely information, which often does not occur.  Because the \nnecessary information is not timely provided, the injury analysis is completed\nmonths after injury trends occur.  With such extensive delays, it is virtually\nimpossible to identify and address significant current trends.  As a result, we find \nthat Howeโs process for quality management falls substantially short of meeting\ngenerally accepted professional standards. \nb.  Records Management\n In each of our record reviews, both on-site and after our tour, we found \nsignificant deviations from generally accepted professional standards.  For example,\nwe saw illegible entries by numerous staff; progress notes placed in the record out of\norder; and outdated assessments and support plans.  According to our expert\nconsultant, the records at Howe are โmaintained haphazardly at best.โ  Howeโs \nfailure to maintain a generally acceptable documentation system poses significant\nrisks for its residents, and promotes constitutional violations. \n\n- 15 -\n3.  Use of Restraints \nGenerally accepted professional standards and constitutional mandates\nrequire staff to release a resident from physical and mechanical restraints when he\nor she no longer presents an imminent threat to him/herself or others.  Moreover, \nrestraints are only to be used in the presence of imminent danger, and the level of\nintrusiveness of the restraint is to be graduated with the least restrictive manner\nnecessary to prevent harm.  For example, if a resident begins to show aggression\ntoward another person, but ceases the aggressive behavior after being restrained,\nthen the threat of imminent harm to self and others is eliminated, and the restraint \nmust be released. \nRestraint practices at Howe deviate substantially from generally accepted\nprofessional standards, specifically in the facilityโs use of four, five, and six-point\nrestraints.  Residents at Howe are subject to such restraints too frequently and for \ntoo long.  From September 2006 to September 2007, Howe staff placed more than\n700 restraints on residents.  Many of these restraints were applied consecutively,\nresulting in individuals being restrained for hours at a time.  For example,\nresidents Y.Y., Z.Z., A.B., J.J., A.D., and F.F. spent between three and eight hours\nat a time in restraints.  In 60 percent of Howeโs uses of restraints, residents were\nimmobilized with their wrists and ankles strapped in place.  In many cases,\nindividuals were also strapped across their chests (five-point restraint) and placed\nin a helmet or face-mask (six-point restraint). \nMoreover, Howeโs procedures to review the appropriateness of restraint were\nfrequently untimely and cursory.  Examples of inappropriate restraint use at Howe\ninclude: \nโข\t  Staff placed resident D.D., who died suddenly in February 2007, in\nfour, five, and six-point restraints with increasing frequency during\nthe last months of his life.  Staff mechanically restrained D.D. on nine\noccasions between October and December 2006, despite serious health\nconcerns regarding his hypertension and erratic behavior.  On \nNovember 29, 2006, D.D. was mechanically restrained for two hours\nwithout evidence that his vital signs were checked at all.  On \nDecember 4 and 10, 2006, when staff again mechanically restrained\nD.D. for two hours, his blood pressure rose to 138/90 and 190/120,\nrespectively.  On December 29, 2006, when D.D. was again\nmechanically restrained, the nurse contacted the Howe physician,\nreported elevated pulse and blood pressure (180/100) readings, yet the\nphysician did not order D.D.โs release from the restraints.  Ninety\nminutes later, D.D.โs blood pressure reached 200/100 while still in five-\n\n- 16 -\npoint restraints, and staff finally released him and gave him\nhypertension medication. \nโข\t  In March 2007, A.B. became upset when her sweater zipper broke;\nstaff personally held her for five minutes, and then placed her in five-\npoint restraints for 35 minutes.  When documenting what justified this\nintrusive response, staff wrote that A.B. โbegan [hitting] self on hand. \nBlocking, verbal prompt did not stop the behavior.โ  The psychologist\nand Qualified Mental Retardation Professional (โQMRPโ) reviewed\nthis restraint more than 40 days later, but noted that no changes were\nneeded to the residentโs behavior program. \nโข\t  In October 2007, when staff told A.B. to stop picking her teeth, she\nbegan to yell and hit her face.  When verbal prompts and physical\nblocks of her arms were unsuccessful in stopping the self-injurious\nbehavior, staff physically held A.B. for ten minutes, and then placed\nher in five-point restraints for 55 minutes.  The QMRP reviewed the \nrestraint two weeks later and concluded that the residentโs behavior \nintervention plan remained appropriate. \nHoweโs indiscriminate use of restraints, and untimely and cursory reviews of\nwhether they are appropriate, constitute an unlawful deprivation of residentsโ\nconstitutionally protected liberty interests. \nC.\t  HEALTH CARE \nThe Supreme Court has determined that institutionalized persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities are entitled to adequate health care.  Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. at 324.  The Court labeled this as one of the โessentials of care that \nthe State must provide.โ  Id.  Identifying a residentโs health care needs and\nproviding adequate health care is a basic component of the planning necessary for\nan individual to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individualโs\nneeds.  Failure to provide adequate health care undermines the other care and\ntreatment provided at Howe and may unnecessarily prolong individualsโ stay at\nHowe. \nPlainly stated, the health care provided to Howe residents is inadequate,\nfalling well below constitutional and other federal standards.  Timely access to\nnecessary medical care often is dangerously delayed.  Medical assessments occur too \ninfrequently, the documentation of medical charts is lacking, and effective\ncommunication between medical providers is absent.  These deficiencies have \nresulted in residents experiencing worsening of symptoms, progression of illnesses,\nand death. \n\n- 17 -\nHealth care at Howe is reactive rather than forward-looking.  Reactive health \ncare occurs when an individualโs access to care depends upon the person presenting\nthemselves for assessment and treatment, while foward-looking health care\nrequires medical professionals to identify individuals at risk, to perform\nassessments, and to provide appropriate treatment.  In a residential disability\ncenter setting such as Howe, individuals are often unable to articulate their health\nstatus to staff or request medical attention due to intellectual or developmental\ndisabilities.  Given these conditions, it is incumbent upon Howe to ensure that the\nhealth care provided is sufficiently proactive to identify potential health issues, to\nintervene before harm or suffering occurs due to illness or injury, and to provide\naccess to health care as soon as possible once symptoms indicating a health problem\narise.  Below, we address eleven areas of health care we find to be problematic at \nHowe. \n1. \t General Medical Care \nAmong the generally accepted professional standards of care in\ndevelopmental facilities like Howe is the requirement that access to necessary\nmedical care be timely.  Delays in assessments, progress reporting, and treatment\nput residents at risk of experiencing complications and avoidable suffering.  We \nfound numerous examples of delays in residents receiving necessary medical care,\nand observed that there are no clear standards or expectations for the Howe\nmedical staff regarding the frequency of physician assessments and progress\nreporting.  These problems have led to violations of the Constitution. \nWhile monthly physician progress notes appeared to be the standard in the\npast, our expert consultantโs review of Howeโs medical charts revealed that this was\nnot the practice during the period of September 2006 through September 2007.\nSome medical charts showed gaps of three to five months between physician\nprogress notes, while several others showed gaps as large as seven to eight months. \nThe examples below illustrate Howeโs problems regarding delayed access to\nnecessary medical care and infrequent physician assessments and progress\nreporting: \nโข\t  The medical chart of X.X., a 30-year-old resident who died in July\n2007, contained a physician progress note and order dated April 6,\n2007, requesting a neurological consultation.  The medical chart does \nnot indicate, however, that any consultation ever took place in the\nthree months prior to X.X.โs death.  According to the autopsy report,\nthe cause of X.X.โs death was โseizure disorder, secondary to congenital \n\n- 18 -\nhydrocephalus/natural.โ8  According to Howeโs medical records, X.X.\nwas last examined by a neurologist on January 20, 2005, more than\ntwo years earlier.  A note in his medical record on February 2, 2007,\nreported bizarre behavior including, โspitting in shoes and inside his\npants, urinating on the floor . . . was redirected; told to stop and also\nblocked . . . will continue to observe and monitor throughout the day.โ\nNumerous other notes indicated inappropriate urination, which can be\nsuggestive of worsening hydrocephalus, yet this behavior was not\nrecognized as potentially reflecting a worsening medical condition.\nFurther, there is an eight-month gap in physician progress notes from\nAugust 2006 through April 2007.  Not only did X.X. not see a\nneurologist in a timely manner, but the only medication prescribed to\nhim was a cream to treat dry skin. \nโข\t  A.E. died in July 2007 from hydrocephalus.  The last physician\nprogress note was entered into A.E.โs medical chart more than a month\nbefore her death, and her last physical examination was in January\n2007.  There is no record of neurological consultation, and the\ndocumentation for her physical examination noted that no neurological\nexam was completed at that time, except for checking deep tendon\nreflexes.  Moreover, A.E.โs vital signs were occasionally not recorded,\nand at times when her vital signs were poor, there was no\ndocumentation of pulse oximetry9 results. \nโข\t  A.F. is a resident with chronic active Hepatitis C.  A.F.โs medical chart \nindicates that in January 2006, it was recommended that a liver\nultrasound exam be completed.  The ultrasound did not occur, \nhowever, until 15 months later, in April 2007.  An assessment in July\n2007 recommended a colonoscopy and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy \n8   Hydrocephalus is an abnormal condition in which cerebrospinal fluid\naccumulates in the ventricles of the brain because of blockage of normal fluid\noutflow from the brain or failure of fluid to be absorbed into the bloodstream quickly\nenough. \n9   Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive diagnostic test used for detecting\noxygen levels in the blood. \n\n- 19 -\n(โEGDโ),10 but at the time of our tour in December 2007, some five \nmonths later, we saw no evidence that either test had been completed. \nThese examples also indicate, in particular, that the medical staff at Howe do\nnot provide ongoing assessments of residentsโ neurological problems, which is\nexacerbated by the fact that there is no on-site neurology service at the Howe clinic.\nResidents must be transported to a hospital approximately one hour away.  The \ntime from referral to appointment ranged from one to three months to see the\nneurologist.  This dramatically limited the continuity of care and overall\ninvolvement of neurologists in resident care.  In two of the examples noted above,\nresidents died from complications associated with hydrocephalus, a serious, yet\nmanageable condition.  Hydrocephalus can be fatal in cases when the diagnosis is\nnot early, and the symptoms are not regularly monitored and appropriately treated.\nIf treated early and appropriately, however, individuals with hydrocephalus can\nrecover with a good quality of life. \nAdditionally, generally accepted professional standards require that there be\neffective communication between medical providers and specialists in order to\nensure that findings and recommendations are addressed.  A review of Howeโs \nmedical charts reveals that consultation reports do not show when, or if, the\nprimary treating physician reviewed the results of the consultation. \nThe lack of effective communication and sharing of information between\nmultiple medical providers working with the same patient can result in delays in\ntreatment, duplication of treatment, and complications due to conflicting\napproaches to care.  In some cases, the breakdown in communication results in \ntragedy, as illustrated below: \nโข  In February 2007, C.D. died of a heart attack.  On the day she died,\nC.D. underwent an unscheduled gynecological exam without the\nnecessary anti-anxiety medication she typically received prior to\ngynecological exams, mammograms, and dental visits.  Witness \naccounts of the exam describe C.D., who was blind and non-verbal, as \nbeing extremely upset, restrained by staff, and repositioned frequently\nduring the exam.  C.D.โs medical chart indicates that she was sensitive \nand resistant to touch, and contains a โdesensitization planโ to reduce \n10   An EGD is a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope (a long,\nflexible, lighted tube with an attached videocamera) is guided down a patientโs\nmouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the beginning of the upper\nintestine).  The endoscope allows a physician to visually detect abnormalities in the\norgans of the upper gastrointestinal tract. \n\n- 20 -\nanxiety during medical examinations, which includes the\nadministration of anti-anxiety medication.  In fact, her medical record \ndocumented successful procedures, including mammograms, when the\nplan was closely followed, as well as prior unsuccessful procedures\nconducted without the benefit of sedation.  C.D.โs medical chart did not \nreveal any documented urgent or emergent need for the gynecological\nexam to be conducted that day, nor was there any documentation that\nthe interdisciplinary team or primary care physician approved the\ndeparture from C.D.โs desensitization plan.  The lack of communication \nand coordination regarding C.D.โs exam resulted in her undergoing an\nunnecessary and avoidable traumatic procedure.  Eyewitnesses to the\nexam reported that C.D. constantly struggled during the procedure\nand was held down by several staff members.  The resulting effects on\nher heart rate, blood pressure, and other sympathetic nervous system\nresponses potentially contributed to her fatal arrhythmia. \nWhile we address C.D.โs tragic death as an example of Howeโs ineffective\ncommunication between medical providers, we are compelled to note also the\nglaring inconsistencies in the documentation of this incident.  Particularly troubling\nin this regard is the physicianโs note for the procedure itself; the note omits any\nmention of any problems with cooperation or agitation by C.D.  The discharge\ntransfer summary completed after C.D.โs death is similarly silent regarding the\nstruggle of her exam, indicating only that C.D. โwas undergoing a medical\nprocedure, had a heart attack, and was provided life-saving services and rushed to\nthe hospital.โ  It was only in a CMS survey conducted shortly after C.D.โs death that\nthe facts surrounding C.D.โs extreme agitation during the procedure are first\ndocumented. \nGenerally, we have found that the primary focus of the medical care provided\nat Howe is acute care.  This type of โreactiveโ approach to providing medical care\naccounts for Howeโs poor record of assessments, progress reporting, and\ncommunication.  Our expert consultantโs review of Howeโs medical charts did not\nlocate any efforts directed at providing preventative care, routine screening, or\nholistic treatment of Howeโs developmentally disabled residents.  Although we\nobserved that physicians at Howe were able to verbally provide detailed summaries\nof residentsโ acute medical issues during medical staffing meetings and when\nvisiting residents, irregular physician evaluations or assessments that only address\nan acute need in isolation from the complete individual increases the risk of\noverlooking important information that affects care and the residentsโ quality of\nlife.  For example: \nโข  A.A.โs medical chart shows regular monthly physician progress notes\nuntil April 2006, at which point the notes appear only in regard to \n\n- 21 -\nacute issues.  Those notes make no mention of A.A.โs bipolar disorder,\nand the sleep record in the chart is from 2005, with no information for\n2006 or 2007.  Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder should have\nongoing monitoring of sleep patterns in order to detect the emergence\nof hypomania/mania as early as possible.  In A.A.โs case, this \nmonitoring did not occur, or at least was not provided to the physician;\nthe physician progress notes are reactive to acute issues, and do not\nregularly track the status of A.A.โs overall health. \nโข\t  Howeโs Assessment Initial/Annual Comprehensive Physical Exam form\nadds to the facilityโs lack of individualized and continuous care, as the\nform contains pre-populated responses for the treating physician to\ncheck.  This form prevents a truly individualized assessment and\nincreases the risk that a physician reviewing the chart will assume\nthat incomplete areas of the form mean that the findings were normal. \n2. \t Medical Emergencies \nThe medical emergency response system at Howe falls substantially below\ngenerally accepted professional standards and places residents at risk of suffering\nserious complications or death.  Howe staff is slow to recognize medical\nemergencies, and is often disorganized in its response.  Moreover, information \nconcerning medical emergencies, including follow-up documentation and incident\nreporting, is often incomplete, disorganized, and untimely.  In some cases, the \nreports are simply inaccurate and misleading.  Competency-based training with\nregard to medical emergencies is also inadequate.  This is problematic in cases\nwhere a physician is not present during the emergency, because a direct care staff\nor an unskilled nurse will have to delay providing emergency treatment until a\nskilled nurse, an Emergency Medical Technician, or a physician arrives.  This delay\nof potentially critical treatment places residents at risk of severe injury or even\ndeath.  The following are just a few tragic examples of Howeโs ineffective\nmanagement of medical emergencies: \nโข\t  As discussed earlier in section II.A.1.b, the investigation of X.X.โs\nsudden death in July 2007 revealed that two attending staff members\nfailed to provide CPR after finding X.X. unresponsive in his bed\nbecause they simply โdid not think to do it.โ  Reportedly, when a staff\nmember found X.X. unresponsive, laying face down in his bed, she\nunsuccessfully attempted to wake him.  She then allegedly yelled for\nanother staff member to call an emergency code.  Reportedly, instead\nof immediately calling the code, the staff member ran to the room and\nattempted to wake X.X. without success.  The staff member then \n\n- 22 -\nallegedly reported the incident to the facility operator, who in turn,\npaged the nurse. \nโข\t  Despite a documented history of swallowing difficulties, A.S., a 67-\nyear-old resident, died in February 2008 after choking on a food bolus.\nThe Emergency Center Nursing Flowsheet from St. James Hospital\nindicated, โdid not attempt the Heimlich.โ  The Medical \nEmergency/CPR Case Review form indicated that it โtook over 5\nminutes to activateโ emergency notification procedure.  โNo idea,โ was \nthe documented answer for the form questions, โWas the emergency\nintervention initiated within 2 minutes of the occurrence?โ and โWas \nthe intervention implemented correctly?โ  Progress notes from the\nphysician responding indicated the Heimlich maneuver was tried, but\nno details were included.  Progress notes from direct support staff were\nnot available for review. \nโข\t  A.G. died at Howe in January 2008.  Staff found her unresponsive on a\ncouch in a common area, already blue/grey in color.  Four months \nbefore her death, A.G. had fallen to the floor from her bed, but despite\nthe seriousness of her fall, Howe failed to send her to the emergency\nroom until the next day, when she began to develop a change in\nconsciousness and shortness of breath.  At that time she was noted to \nhave four fractured ribs and a large pneumothorax,11 requiring\nplacement of a chest tube.  Additionally, A.G. was also noted to have a\nlost a significant amount of weight in the months prior to her death โ\nmore than 10 percent of her body weight in a three-month period โ yet\nthere were no documented concerns or plans to address the weight\nloss. \n3.\t  Nursing Assessments  \nWe find the nursing assessments at Howe generally to be incomplete and\nfragmented.  It also appears that in many cases, nurses are not conducting\nassessments at all, but instead are simply duplicating the results of prior \nassessments.  Of particular concern are assessments of residents with acute\nillnesses and injuries.  For example, in January 2007, Howe staff measured Z.Z.โs\nblood pressure to be 145/86 while in restraints.  Z.Z. remained in restraints for two \nhours, but the attending nurse did not flag this high blood pressure reading, and\ndid not conduct an appropriate physical assessment.  Below, we detail several areas \n11   Pneumothorax is a collection of air or gas in the pleural cavity, which\ncan cause the lungs to collapse. \n\n- 23 -\nin which the nursing assessments at Howe substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards. \nNursing assessments at Howe are not adequately integrated into the\nresidentsโ individualized support plans (โISPsโ).  Part of the ISP should be an \nindividual health care plan (โIHCPโ).  The IHCP should be periodically updated\nthroughout the year to reflect changes in the residentโs health status and goals.\nThe goals and outcomes of the IHCPs at Howe, however, are updated only once a \nyear.  Of all the IHCPs our expert consultant reviewed, only three were updated\nprior to the residentโs annual interdisciplinary assessment.  This means that the \nindividualโs treatment team is not provided with the individualโs current health\nstatus when determining necessary supports and services.  Treatment of residentsโ \nhealth care is an ongoing process and such infrequent evaluation of the nursing\nneeds of residents fails to meet acceptable standards of care. \nAdditionally, the participation by the nurses in the interdisciplinary\ntreatment team meetings that produce the ISPs is inadequate.  Information \nobtained from nursing assessments and nursing diagnoses is not reflected within\nthe ISP process.  The nursesโ role in the care and desired outcomes of Howeโs \nresidents is fragmented at best.  In general, nurses are not proactive with regard to\nthe health care outcomes of residents.  Preventative care is particularly important\nfor residents at Howe with diminished communication skills who cannot easily\nidentify and convey health issues. \nNursing care plans at Howe are general and non-specific, and often do not\ninclude individualized interventions to prevent recurrence of illnesses.  We find the \nrecommendations contained in the nursing care plans fail to delineate individual-\nspecific signs and symptoms to be monitored.  This is particularly concerning for\nresidents identified at high risk for injury or illness.  Moreover, nurses at Howe are \nnot providing consistent monitoring and complete documentation regarding chronic\nhealth care issues, such as constipation and aspiration, which are life-threatening\nconditions for many health-compromised residents at Howe. \nFurther, pain assessment and individual manifestations of pain are not\ndocumented in the nursing care plans.  Residentsโ pain may manifest in behavioral\nsymptoms, such as depression, anxiety, aggression, or decreased socialization.  All \nof these may lead to a decrease in pain tolerance, or unnecessary administration of\npsychotropic medications that treat the behavioral symptoms of the pain, but do not\naddress the cause of the pain. \nThe recognition and documentation of individual manifestations of pain is\nparticularly important, given Howeโs heavy reliance upon temporary, part-time\nnurses to provide care.  Indeed, our expert consultant asked Howeโs Director of \n\n- 24 -\nNursing how a temporary part-time nurse would know whether a particular\nresident was in pain.  The Director replied that the incoming nurse would have to\nobtain such information from the direct care staff.  If the documentation were \nadequate, then any nurse could rely on residentsโ charts to better understand their\nneeds and behaviors, and would not need to rely on the assessments of the direct\ncare staff, who are often not medically trained professionals. \nInadequate documentation by Howe nurses is also problematic.  When notes \nare made in the flow sheets and logs, they are often incomplete, failing to fully\ndescribe the health event, and hindering adequate follow-up care.  For example: \nโข\t  Menstrual cycle records are often incomplete, particularly in Z.Z.โs\ncase, where no explanation is provided for long gaps in the record. \nโข\t  Long gaps appear in the sleep records of residents, particularly in the\ncase of G.G. \nInadequate documentation is also present in the nursing progress notes.  A \nnursing progress note should fully describe the condition presented, and each\nsubsequent progress note should address the condition until resolution.  The \nmajority of nursing progress notes reviewed by our expert consultant, however, did\nnot contain a description, action taken, or follow-up action, for the conditions\npresented.  Moreover, Howe progress notes are disconnected โ failing logically to\nflow from shift to shift โ and result in a lack of appropriate follow-up care to the\ncondition presented.  Progress notes also include vague expressions and relative\nterms with little diagnostic value, such as โgood day,โ โate well,โ or โquiet night.โ \nFurther, dated progress notes are often not in chronological sequence, hindering\nreview even when the progress notes are adequate. \n4. \t Physical Therapy and Nutritional Management \nHowe does not provide sufficient physical therapy services.  Physical therapy\nis critical to the residents of Howe in order to maintain their motor skills, joint\nrange of motion, gait training, and posture.  Many residents at Howe remain in\nIndividual Positioning Devices (โIDPsโ), such as wheelchairs, without a specific\nmedical indication that such confinement is necessary.  Confining residents\nunnecessarily to IPDs greatly increases the risk of osteoporosis, atrophy, scoliosis,\nskin breakdown, and muscle weakness over time, and needlessly complicates\nplacement in a more integrated setting.  Some Howe residents are ambulatory, but\nnevertheless use IDPs to prevent falls or to facilitate transport.  This practice will\nfoster regression of ambulation skills.  These deficiencies violate the Constitution. \n\n- 25 -\nDue to a high and unmanageable caseload, the physical therapists at Howe\ndo not have time to conduct ongoing training and evaluation of direct care staff to\nensure that physical therapy programs are being adequately implemented.  Direct \ncare staff is responsible for the majority of the motor skill needs of residents, but\nare inadequately trained for this responsibility.  It appears that Howe provides new\ndirect care staff with minimal training on only transfers and positioning.  \nAgain, due to a high and unmanageable case load, the physical therapists at\nHowe reactively address the most serious cases, leaving many residents with\nphysical therapy needs untreated.  In addition, the caseload is likely causing other\nissues that we observed, such as: \nโข\t  Physical therapists do not routinely review positioning plans. \nโข\t  Evaluations do not routinely include long-term physical therapy goals\nto optimize or maintain residentsโ independence.  Evaluations also do \nnot routinely include a baseline functioning assessment. \nโข\t  Physical therapists rarely attend interdisciplinary treatment team\nmeetings, and consequently, have been unable to communicate to other\nHowe professionals the physical therapy needs of the majority of\nresidents. \nOf particular concern regarding physical therapy is Howeโs failure to conduct\nadequate root-cause analysis of resident falls.  This failure places Howe residents at\nrisk of injury.  Successful fall prevention requires a thorough clinical assessment of\nresidents who fall (or have a history of falls) and their environment.  After a fall, \nclinical staff should evaluate orthostatic blood pressure; extrinsic factors (e.g., wet\nfloor, loose rug); intrinsic factors (e.g., seizure disorder); and medications.  A \nthorough assessment of gait and balance should be included in the evaluation. \nFurther, the appropriateness of mobility devices, such as walkers and wheelchairs,\nand the need for personal assistance should be reviewed regularly and re-evaluated \nas necessary.  Such steps, which will decrease the risk of future falls, are not\ncurrently being taken at Howe. \nAnother area of concern is Howeโs general nutritional management, and its\nphysical and nutritional management of residents with swallowing difficulties.\nHowe has an Interdisciplinary Nutritional Management Committee that meets at\nregular intervals to discuss the nutritional management needs of residents and the\ncurrent meal plan.  The outcomes of these committee meetings, however, are not\neffectively communicated across disciplines.  For example, a Howe nutritionist\nstated that the nutritionists were not routinely informed of changes or additions of\nmedications, particularly antibiotics. \n\n- 26 -\nAdditionally, individuals at Howe with dysphagia (swallowing disorder), and\nthose at risk of aspiration are not assessed on a routine basis, and the nutritional\nmanagement team has not developed levels of care to prioritize residents with the\nmost serious and acute needs for services.  Similarly, Howe residents diagnosed\nwith Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (โGERDโ) do not have detailed positioning\nplans.  Howe does not have a comprehensive positioning program, which is critical\nfor proper swallowing, adequate digestion, and nutritional management.  Further, \nthere does not appear to be a process at Howe to reassess or modify a positioning\nprogram should a swallowing event occur (e.g., choking, gagging, or coughing). \nWe reviewed meal plans at Howe and found them to be easy to read and\nunderstand.  Our observation of meals, however, revealed that positioning is not\nimplemented on schedule.  Physical and nutritional plans are not adequately\nindividualized (i.e., no choices are provided), and do not address varied settings\nwhere swallowing difficulties occur.  These concerns in physical and nutritional\nmanagement place residents at Howe at risk of significant injury. \n5.  Infection Control \nThe Howe Infection Control Committee (โCommitteeโ) plans for and manages\nthe facilityโs response to outbreaks of infectious illness, specifically in critical areas\nregarding the current guidelines for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(โMRSAโ) treatment and management.  Our expert consultant reviewed the\nminutes of the Committeeโs meetings from 2006 and 2007, as well as the Howe\nInfection Control Manual.  The Committee adequately discusses current infection\ncontrol issues and anticipates and plans for seasonal patterns of infectious disease. \nWe note, however, that a centralized record showing the updated immunization\nstatus of each resident and employee was not available at the time our tour. \n6.  Pharmacy Services \nWe have found Howeโs pharmacy services to be constitutionally inadequate. \nGenerally accepted professional standards regarding pharmacy services for a\nfacility such as Howe require routine review of medication regimens by\npharmacists, and effective communication between the pharmacists and the\nprescribing clinicians.  Howe substantially departs from these standards.  Reviews \nof medication regimens are irregular and infrequent.  When the reviews do take \nplace, identified issues are not effectively communicated to the prescribing clinician. \nOur expert consultant reviewed the โMedication Quarterly Reviews by\nClientโ for the period of March 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007, and found that\nall of the reviews were conducted in either June or November.  That is to say, there\nwas not a single medication review during the 5-month period between June and \n\n- 27 -\nNovember.  Some residents were identified as having even longer gaps between\nmedication reviews, such as A.J. (19 months), C.G. (13 months), C.H. (8 months),\nand A.K. (7 months).  In A.L.โs case, the combination of medications prescribed put\nA.L. at risk of a fatal rash (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) and required careful\nmonitoring that, as evidenced by the 13-month gap in review, did not happen.  Our \nexpert consultant similarly reviewed the Drug Regimen Review Findings forms\nfrom January 1, 2007, through November 30, 2007, and most of the reviews\noccurred in either February or November.  With only a few exceptions, no reviews\nwere conducted during the nine-month period between February and November. \nIn reviewing the โMedication Quarterly Reviews by Clientโ and the โDrug\nRegimen Review Findings,โ it is apparent that the communication between the\npharmacist and the prescribing clinicians is ineffective.  Many reviews included\ncomments or requests for clarification by the pharmacist, who identified serious\nconcerns with the choice or dosage of prescribed medication.  It is not clear from the \nreviews, however, what, if any, action was taken by the prescribing clinician in \nresponse.  For example, in one review a request for clarification was noted because\nA.M. shares a last name with another resident, and it appears that a medication\nprescribed to A.M. was actually meant for the other resident.  In another example, a\nrequest for clarification was made regarding C.I.โs prescription of non-enteric-coated\naspirin, which could be dangerous if C.I. has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding,\nstomach ulcers, reflux, or gastric sensitivity. \nIn addition, there had been no Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee\nmeetings at Howe for at least the six months prior to our tour in December 2007.\nThere appears to be a state-level Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, but it\ndoes not appear Howe is represented on this Committee. \nThe substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards of\ncare at Howe regarding pharmacy services places the residents at risk for\nsignificant medical complications, adverse drug reactions, and potentially even\ndeath.  Individuals with developmental disabilities are at great risk for adverse\ndrug reactions and side effects from medications.  The need for dedicated and \nfrequent oversight of all medication use is imperative for patient safety.    \n7.  Medication Administration \nCurrently, Howe has no formal system in place to track medication error data\nadequately, or to analyze such data to identify problems, plan for improvements,\nimplement changes, and evaluate the effect of changes.  Moreover, there are no \nregular forums at Howe in which such data are shared and discussed with the\nnursing staff.  These absences are a substantial departure from generally accepted\nprofessional standards. \n\n- 28 -\nDuring our tour, Howeโs Director of Nursing stated that medication errors\nwere rare at Howe.  We have found, however, that the medication error reporting\nsystem at Howe is ineffective, and communication at all levels of the nursing staff is \npoor.  The lack of an effective reporting system and poor communication suggest\nthat medication errors may not be accurately identified and reported. \nAdditionally, two other medication administration issues at Howe suggest\nthe potential for medication errors.  First, nurses at Howe are responsible for\nadministering medication to several housing units, and often to so many residents\nas to exceed what can safely be managed.  Second, because of Howeโs low retention \nrate among nurses, newly hired and temporary nurses are reassigned frequently\nand are unfamiliar with residentsโ identities. \n8.  Dental Care \nDental care at Howe falls substantially below generally accepted professional\nstandards and places residents at an unjustifiable risk of harm.  Generally accepted\nprofessional standards require that residents receive routine dental care every six\nmonths, and that oral x-rays be completed annually.  Routine dental care facilitates \nearly detection and treatment of oral disease.  Such care is particularly critical for\nindividuals with developmental disabilities because they may be nonverbal or may\nhave difficulty communicating pain or discomfort. \nGenerally accepted professional standards also require that individuals with\ndisabilities be positioned appropriately when receiving dental care services.  Proper\npositioning is important to ensure residentsโ safety because they may have a higher\nrisk for aspiration, have skeletal conditions that must be taken into account, or\nexhibit combative behavior because of their disabilities. \nSubstantially departing from generally accepted professional standards, 215\nof the 332 Howe residents we reviewed were not receiving any routine dental care.\nFor these residents, dental care consisted only of emergency care and/or necessary\nextractions.  These residents received dental care under general anesthesia only. \nAnother 100 residents received comprehensive dental care, also under general\nanesthesia.  Only 17 residents participated in limited dental exams and treatment\non site without anesthesia.  Even in the small number of instances where the \nfacility did provide routine dental assessments, the assessments tended to be\nannual instead of every six months.  Moreover, x-rays were conducted rarely, only\nwhen โabsolutely necessary,โ even where residentsโ records noted that they had\nserious dental problems like moderate to severe gingivitis, periodontitis, or bleeding \ngums.  Further, and again contrary to generally accepted professional standards,\nresidents at risk for dysphagia were positioned at a uniform angle for dental work, \n\n- 29 -\ndespite the recommendations of speech pathologists, who indicated that more\nindividualized positioning was necessary. \n \nHoweโs failure to provide routine dental care to the majority of its residents\nand position them properly when they receive dental services places residents at\nrisk of serious harm.  Lack of routine dental care may result in delays in treatment,\nwhich may lead to infections, abscesses, need for extractions, and systemic disease,\nincluding heart disease and bacterial infections in the blood.  Dental pain can also\nmanifest itself in a variety of other types of harm, including behavioral and\nnutrition problems, choking, and aspiration.  Finally, among other complications,\nimproper positioning places residents at risk of aspiration. \n9.  Nursing Staffing and Training \nShortages of nurses have led Howe to rely heavily upon temporary part-time\nnurses, and have forced many nurses to work excessive overtime.  For example, our\nexpert consultant reviewed the staffing schedules for July and August 2007, and\nfound that 68 shifts were โdoublesโ โ that is, a nurse worked a 16-hour double shift, \nand 81 shifts during the month of August were staffed by temporary part-time \nnurses.  During this period there were 67 medical incidents or injuries that required\ntransfer from Howe. \nStaffing information at Howe is fragmented and logged manually within the\nseparate residences.  The scheduling and planning of nurses across residences is\nconducted by the Director of Nursing, and does not appear to account for the\nindividual needs and levels of care of residents within each of the residences.  For \nexample, House 105 is the residence with Howeโs most medically fragile residents,\nyet until just prior to our tour, it was understaffed by nurses. \nHoweโs system of staffing nurses is inadequate and jeopardizes resident\nsafety and quality of care.  Howe lacks a centralized, computer-based staffing\ninformation system, and at the time of our tour, was unable to present us with\ncomplete information regarding staffing minimums and ratios of nurses to\nresidents.  Howeโs information regarding staffing is disorganized, and therefore,\nprovides very little meaningful data necessary for appropriate staffing planning and\nscheduling. \nFurthermore, Howe lacks an adequate nursing training program.  The \ntraining provided at Howe is not uniformly competency-based.  Nurses are not \nroutinely evaluated on whether they are capable of competently performing the\nskills presented in the training and necessary for their duties at Howe.  \n\n- 30 -\nHoweโs nursing staffing is insufficient, and Howeโs system of nurse training\nprograms are inadequate.  Both of these deficiencies are major contributing factors\nto the constitutionally inadequate nursing care provided at Howe. \n10.  Medical Records \nHoweโs record keeping practices substantially depart from generally accepted\nprofessional standards that medical records be organized, accurate, and up to date. \nFacilities like Howe should maintain all medical records in a uniform \norganizational format; enter notes legibly; clearly mark sections of the medical\nchart to delineate the contents within each section; note documentation errors \nproperly; indicate the type of note being entered; indicate date and time; sign notes;\nfile documents properly into the correct patientโs chart; and, timely add documents\nto residentsโ charts to keep records current.  Following these protocols is critical\nbecause medical records are vital in capturing, sharing, and storing necessary\ninformation to provide timely, appropriate, and potentially live-saving medical care. \nAt Howe, residentsโ medical records are poorly organized and extremely\ndifficult to follow.  Instead of maintaining one master chart for each resident in one\neasily accessible place, Howe keeps two charts for each resident in two separate\nlocations; a residentโs medical chart is located in the healthcare home, while the \nrest of the chart is located in the home in which the resident lives.  In addition, \ndifferent functional areas use separate sections of residentsโ charts.  These practices\ncreate a disjointed record that makes it challenging to get an accurate and complete\npicture of the residentsโ condition at any particular time. \nAdditionally, Howe fails to audit its medical records to ensure that they are\norganized, accurate, and current.  Our review indicated that records contain filing\nerrors, including instances in which documents for one resident are erroneously\nfiled in another residentโs chart.  Progress notes and consultations are frequently\nout of order or misfiled, some notes reference notes that are missing from the file,\nand other notes are illegible or inconsistently signed.  Further, Medication \nAdministration Records (โMARsโ) and Treatment/Procedure forms from previous\nmonths that should have been included in residentsโ medical charts had not yet\nbeen filed as of the time of our tour. \nMoreover, although Howe maintains 24-hour nursing logs that contain\nvaluable information about residents, these logs are shredded after three months.\nUnfortunately, prior to the destruction of these records, Howe makes no effort to\ntranscribe relevant information into individual files; at most, staff verbally report\nthe information in the nursing logs, making it likely that this information will be\nlost permanently. \n\n- 31 -\nFinally, the lists we were provided that named residents who had identified\nhealth risks and conditions (e.g., choking, pica) did not consistently correlate with\nrisks identified in these residentsโ medical records.  For example, residents whose\nmedical records clearly identified and addressed specific risks for a particular\ncondition did not appear on the list of individuals at risk for that condition.  In \nother instances, residents were on the at-risk lists provided to us, but their medical\ncharts did not reflect that the identified risk had been noted or addressed. \nHoweโs substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards\nin medical record keeping places its residents at risk of harm.  Inconsistent \norganization, documentation, and filing in medical records can prevent health care\nproviders from being able to find needed information about a resident.  This can \nlead to potentially fatal errors, duplication of care, and inaccurate diagnosis and \ntreatment.  For example, if a residentโs disjointed and inaccurate record prevents a\nphysician from becoming aware of a prior serious problem, like a bowel impaction,\nthe physician may not be able to recognize the early signs of discomfort upon a\nrecurrence of the problem.  This could result not only in unnecessary pain and\ndiscomfort for the resident, but could also progress to severe impaction - an\nemergency that may result in bowel rupture and death. \n11.  Quality Assurance \nHoweโs โreactiveโ approach to medical care is further evidenced by the\nfacilityโs shortcomings in the area of quality assurance.  Effective quality assurance\nmanagement is vital to identifying deficiencies that can be corrected through\nchanges in policies, procedures, or other corrective actions.  Ineffective quality\nassurance management leads to preventable negative outcomes, which result in\nresidents suffering unnecessarily. \nCentral to effective quality assurance management in a facility such as Howe\nis continuous communication between the members of the health care team.  The \ncommunication at Howe between the various members of the medical staff is \ninadequate.  Generally accepted professional standards require that communication\nbetween members of the health care team occurs, not only through residentsโ\nmedical charting and progress reporting as discussed in several sections above, but\nit must also occur through quality assurance committees and through clear policies\nand procedures. \nHowe does not have quality assurance committees in place.  For example,\nthere is no quality assurance and improvement committee, utilization review\ncommittee, or peer review committee.  The absence of such committees prevents the\ndevelopment of proven quality assurance measures such as:  (1) systematic \n\n- 32 -\nmonitoring of the quality of care being provided; (2) identification of the\nunderutilization and overutilization of health care interventions being provided;\n(3) assurance of timely access to needed care when indicated; and (4) prompt\nidentification of systemic issues or trends that require intervention. \nFurther, Howeโs policies and procedures are not regularly reviewed and\nupdated to reflect current, generally accepted practices.  Clinical policies and\nprocedures at Howe do not appear to have been reviewed for many years. \nD.  PSYCHIATRIC CARE \nConstitutional and other federal standards require that state-operated\nfacilities like Howe provide adequate mental health care for their residents with\nmental illness.  Below, we discuss the psychiatric care at Howe, and conclude that\nthe facility is violating those standards.  In particular, for residents with psychiatric\ncare needs, Howe substantially departs from generally accepted professional\nstandards in:  (1) conducting adequate initial comprehensive psychiatric\nassessments, as well as follow-up assessments; (2) providing adequate psychiatric\ninvolvement and coordinated care with other treating professionals;\n(3) regularly monitoring for movement disorders in residents who are on\nantipsychotic medications; and, (4) providing psychotherapy services. \n1.  Psychiatric Assessments \nGenerally accepted professional standards require facilities like Howe to\nprovide residents needing psychiatric care with an adequate initial comprehensive\npsychiatric assessment.  Among other things, this assessment should include\npresenting concerns; current, past, family, social, and medical histories; current\nmedications; allergies; a mental status exam; and a diagnosis.  This assessment also \nshould provide recommendations and a treatment plan, and should indicate when\nthe resident will be seen for follow-up.  Follow-up assessments should take place\nbased upon clinical need, typically between one and three months after the \nassessment.  Adequate comprehensive assessments are important for improving\naccuracy in diagnoses, preventing the prescription of inappropriate or unsafe\nmedications, and assisting the psychiatrist in developing an effective treatment\nplan.  Routine follow-up appointments allow psychiatrists to assess the\neffectiveness of treatment and address concerns quickly and effectively. \nIn substantially departing from these generally accepted professional\nstandards, Howe fails to conduct adequate psychiatric assessments of residents.\nThe assessments our expert consultant reviewed consistently failed to contain all\nthe elements necessary to indicate that a comprehensive assessment had been\ncompleted.  Specifically, at Howe, assessments do not contain necessary details \n\n- 33 -\nregarding medical history, family history, and relevant social and environmental\nissues that could be contributing to a residentโs present illness.  Assessments \nroutinely fail to document the need for follow-up care and when it should occur. \nThey also fail to indicate whether previous psychiatric notes were reviewed or state\nwho was interviewed as part of the assessment, often even where a resident is\nnonverbal.  Additionally, progress notes in charts consistently indicated โnoneโ next\nto โmedical concerns relevant to this psychiatric consultation,โ which is unusual as\nresidents undergoing a psychiatric consultation will often have medical conditions\nrelevant to the psychiatric diagnosis and/or treatment options. \n \nOur expert consultant also observed that the information contained in\nassessments did not provide a clinical basis for the resulting diagnosis, medication,\nand treatment recommendations.  For example, A.N. was diagnosed with pica\nduring an annual psychiatric assessment, yet the psychiatric note contained no\ndocumentation supporting how the diagnosis was made or how it would be\naddressed.  Another resident, A.O. had diagnoses of psychotic disorder not\notherwise specified (โNOSโ) and mood disorder NOS, but these diagnoses were\ninconsistent with other diagnoses listed in A.O.โs records.  Moreover, none of the \npsychiatric diagnoses supported the need for the medication the psychiatrist\nrecommended for A.O. in the progress notes. \nHoweโs failure to provide adequate, comprehensive psychiatric assessments\nplaces residents at risk of serious harm.  The lack of important information\nregarding family, medical, social, and environmental history may result in\ninaccurate diagnoses and the worsening of symptoms because of inappropriate,\nineffective, or delayed treatment.  Moreover, the lack of routine follow up leads to\ncrisis-oriented care in which the psychiatrist is consulted only where behavioral\nconcerns escalate. \n2.  Coordination of Care  and Psychiatric Involvement \nGenerally accepted professional standards require coordination of residentsโ\ncare between psychiatrists and other treating professionals, including primary care\nproviders, psychologists, and therapists.  Such coordination decreases the risk that \nmultiple clinicians may not be aware of what their counterparts may be prescribing\nor treating.  For example, some psychiatric medications may not be appropriate for\nindividuals who have certain health conditions.  Moreover, because individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities may have difficulty communicating directly with care\ngivers, it is particularly important for treating professionals to collect information\nabout individuals from one another.  For psychiatrists in particular, generally\naccepted professional standards dictate that they should communicate their\nfindings and recommendations with clinical teams and should be readily available\nfor consultation and prompt follow up regarding, for example, medication changes. \n\n- 34 -\nFinally, primary treating physicians should respond to psychiatric\nrecommendations promptly. \nOur expert consultantโs review concluded that Howe fails to provide\ncoordinated care to its residents with psychiatric needs, fails to provide adequate\npsychiatric involvement, and fails to respond promptly to psychiatric\nrecommendations.  These failures express a substantial departure from generally\naccepted professional standards.  Psychiatric assessments often do not include any\nindication that the psychiatrist reviewed the residentโs medical chart or consulted\nwith other individuals involved in the residentโs care.  For example, the records of\nresident, E.E., had no indication of such review even though E.E. has โno\nintelligible speech;โ the records of A.P. had no such review even though this\nresident was โtalking nonsense to himself;โ and the records of A.Q. had no such\nreview even though this resident is โnonverbal.โ \nAdditionally, even where a resident, C.H., had a history of four psychiatric\nhospitalizations, his records contained no indication that psychiatry professionals at\nHowe had discussed his case with psychology or other treatment team staff, or that\nprogress in obtaining desired outcomes was addressed.  Similarly, the initial\npsychiatric assessment of A.R., a resident who had recently been admitted to the\nhospital, contained no indication that her hospital records had been reviewed. \nIn addition to failing to coordinate care, Howe fails to provide adequate\npsychiatric involvement for residents who have psychiatric needs.  Even where \nresidents exhibit extremely challenging behaviors, the frequency of psychiatric\ninvolvement at Howe is minimal.  Part of Howeโs failure in this regard appears to \nbe a result of staffing difficulties.  Since Howeโs psychiatrist left approximately one\nand a half years prior to our tour, the facility has been providing only rotating\npsychiatric coverage. \nExamples of Howeโs failure to provide adequate psychiatric involvement to\nresidents include: \nโข\t  In 2003, C.J. was prescribed Risperdal12 at a dosage that exceeds the\nFDA-approved dosage.  This resident also was noted to have \nconstipation, seizures, hyperlipidemia, and cardiac concerns โ all of\nthese are conditions to which Risperdal is known to contribute.  A \npsychiatric note dated April 27, 2007 indicated that C.J. did not\ntolerate lower dosages of the medication.  As of the time of our visit โ \n12  Risperdal is a medication used to treat conditions such as\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder. \n\n- 35 -\nmore than seven months after this note was written โ the chart \ncontained no indication of additional psychiatric involvement for this\nresident, despite his clear need for much closer monitoring. \nโข\t  C.H. was referred for a psychiatric evaluation.  A note in his record \nindicated that the psychiatrist tried to see him on September 22, 2007,\nbut was unable to do so because the resident was on a home visit.  The \npsychiatrist noted that he spoke with staff and that he planned to see\nthe resident later.  As of our tour, approximately two and a half\nmonths later, C.H.โs record contained no indication that he received \nthe psychiatric evaluation for which he had been referred.  This is \nparticularly concerning given that, as noted above, this same resident\nhad a long history of psychiatric hospitalizations. \nAdditionally, we found an instance where the psychiatrist made numerous\nrecommendations regarding changes to a residentโs medications without ever\nexamining the resident and without taking into account medication changes that\nmay have been occurring while that resident was admitted to the hospital. \nSpecifically, while resident A.S. was in the hospital for mania, the psychiatrist\nwrote in A.S.โs record that the psychiatristโs report was based on โchart review and\ndiscussion with interdisciplinary teams.  I have not examined [A.S.].  The following\nnonetheless is based on thorough review and current scientific thinking.โ  The \npsychiatrist proceeded to make multiple recommendations to adjust medications,\nwithout any regard as to what changes were being made at the hospital, and\nwithout any mention of a plan for a consultation once the resident returned from\nthe hospital.  The only other psychiatric note in the record was dated more than\nthree and a half years prior. \nWe also found that Howeโs primary treating physicians fail to respond\npromptly to psychiatric recommendations, thereby delaying care for residents,\nsometimes for months or longer, and placing them at risk of serious harm.  For \nexample, on March 16, 2007, the psychiatrist recommended that F.F. be started on\nDepakote.13  The order for this medication, however, was not written for nearly\nthree months.  Moreover, approximately two and a half months after the order was\nfinally written, the psychiatrist recommended that the dosage be increased, the\nresidentโs blood level re-checked, and that the resident be started on Risperdal.  It \nappears that none of this was done at the time of the recommendation.  Instead, \napproximately two and a half months after the second recommendation, Depakote\nwas finally increased and an order was written to check the residentโs blood levels \n13  Depakote is a medication that may be used to treat conditions such as\nseizure disorder and bipolar disorder. \n\n- 36 -\nin another two weeks.  The only other psychiatric note in the record was from three\nyears prior. \nIn short, Howeโs failure to provide coordinated care and sufficient psychiatric\ninvolvement, as well as the failure of treating physicians to timely implement\npsychiatric recommendations, substantially departs from generally accepted\nprofessional standards and places residents at risk of serious harm.  As noted \nabove, the lack of routine follow-up and continuity leads to crisis-oriented care\nwhere the psychiatrist is consulted only when behaviors have escalated.  Delays in\nresponding to recommendations contribute to continued symptoms and potentially\nworsening of the behavioral health condition, which can lead to unnecessary\nhospitalization, increased injury to self or others, and increased use of physical or\nchemical restraints.  These deficiencies may undercut the other care and treatment\nprovided at Howe, making it more difficult for the individual to move to a more\nintegrated setting. \n  3. \t Monitoring of Residents on Antipsychotic Medications for \nMovement Disorders  \nContrary to generally accepted professional standards, Howe routinely fails\nto adequately monitor residents who are on antipsychotic medications for movement\ndisorders.  Generally accepted professional standards require facilities like Howe to\nprovide such monitoring, using standard assessment tools, every six months.\nMonitoring for movement disorders is critical because antipsychotic medications\nmay cause tardive dyskinesia.14  Howeโs failure to regularly assess residents on\nsuch medications for these disorders places residents at risk of serious harm for\nsevere, chronic, and unremitting movement disorders. \n4. \t Psychotherapy Services \nThe need for psychotherapy services is not being identified in many\nresidents, and when it is identified, psychotherapy services are almost never\nprovided.  Group psychotherapy is non-existent.  Unfortunately, while it is clear\nthat psychotherapy services are lacking, our expert consultant could not discern\nexactly what mental health services are being provided at Howe.  For example, we\nreceived conflicting information as to whether services are provided on-site or off-\nsite, and as to how many residents are receiving services. \n14   Tardive dyskinesia is a muscular side effect of anti-psychotic drugs\nand is primarily characterized by random movements in the tongue, lips, or jaw as\nwell as facial grimacing, movements of arms, legs, fingers, and toes, or even\nswaying movements of the trunk or hips. \n\n- 37 -\nE.  BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT AND HABILITATION\n \nHoweโs residents are entitled to โthe minimally adequate training required\nby the Constitution . . . as may be reasonable in light of [the residentsโ] liberty\ninterests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.โ  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 322.  A fundamental purpose of this training is to enable the movement of\nindividuals into the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs as required\nby Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.  Generally accepted professional standards require\nthat appropriate psychological interventions, such as behavioral treatment and\nhabilitation plans, be used to address significant behavior problems and significant\nlearning deficiencies.  Howe fails to provide such psychological interventions to\nmeet the needs of its residents.  As described in more detail below, Howeโs \ndeficiencies in this regard substantially hinder treatment of residentsโ problem\nbehaviors, exposing residents to an increased risk of abuse, and compromising\nresidentsโ opportunities for placement in a more integrated setting.  Specifically,\nHowe:  (1) provides residents with ineffective behavioral treatment; (2) exposes\nresidents to undue restraints; and, (3) provides inadequate habilitation treatment\nand communication therapy. \n  \n1. \t Behavioral Treatment \nBehavioral treatment services at Howe substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards of care for individuals with developmental\ndisabilities.  As a result, residents are suffering harm because of untreated self-\ninjurious behavior and untreated peer aggression.  Further, residents are failing in\nday treatment services and are being deprived access to community placement\nbecause of inadequately treated challenging behaviors.  Below, we discuss two areas \nof behavioral treatment:  (a) functional behavioral assessments and treatment\nplanning; and (b) implementation and evaluation. \na. \t Functional Behavioral Assessments and \nTreatment Planning \nFunctional behavioral assessments at Howe are seriously deficient.\nGenerally accepted professional standards dictate that there be an adequate and\ncurrent functional behavioral assessment in all cases prior to the initiation of\nbehavioral treatment.  Functional behavioral assessment is a professional\nassessment technique that identifies the particular positive or negative factors that\nprompt or maintain a challenging behavior for a given individual.  By\nunderstanding the causes or โfunctionsโ of challenging behaviors, professionals can\nattempt to reduce or eliminate those factors and thus reduce or eliminate the\nchallenging behaviors. \n\n- 38 -\nWithout an accurate assessment of the functions of behaviors targeted for\nchange, those behaviors will persist and become exacerbated, which can result in\ndanger both to the resident and to those around the resident, and can needlessly\ncomplicate opportunity for placement in a more integrated setting.  It is critical that \nthe function served by the target behavior is defined accurately when choosing a\nreplacement behavior for that target.  Inaccurate functional behavioral assessments \nlead to a choice of replacement behaviors that is unlikely to have any impact on the\noccurrence of the target behaviors.  Howe, however, relies too heavily on a single\nwritten screening tool, leaving room for inaccuracy in defining the function of the\ntarget behavior.  Extensive observational analysis of the behavior problem is needed\nto verify functional behavioral assessments.  Only a proper functional behavior\nassessment can lead to appropriate treatment options and follow-up services and\nsupports, and Howe, consequently, is failing to make use of critical information\nabout residents. \nIn fact, replacement behaviors are entirely missing in some behavior plans\nand are grossly inappropriate in others.  For example, several residents have a\nprogram simply to teach โwaiting.โ  One of these residents, A.O., has a program in\nwhich staff are instructed to approach him, ask him if there is anything that he\nwants or needs, and then inform him that it will be brought to him, but that he\nmust wait for a set period of time.  โWaitingโ as a replacement behavior is not\noperationally defined and, in any event, is not a replacement behavior; it does not\nserve the same functions as a behavior that promptly produces demanded items.\nMoreover, we have a serious concern about the appropriateness of simply teaching a\ndevelopmentally disabled resident to wait, as it perpetuates the attitude that\nindividuals with disabilities should be passive recipients of whatever their\nenvironment is able to offer them.  A โperson-centeredโ approach15 to treatment \nplanning would suggest, by contrast, teaching individuals to ask appropriately for\nwhat they want, to occupy themselves safely and appropriately if their request\ncannot be met immediately, and to accept some alternative if the request cannot be\nmet at all.  Even if โwaitingโ was considered an appropriate replacement behavior,\nthe intervention used for A.O. โ deliberately asking A.O. if he wants or needs\nsomething and then telling him he has to wait a certain period of time โ is far more\nlikely to induce challenging behaviors than to produce any positive effect. \nSimilarly, we have observed โcomplianceโ as a replacement behavior, which\nwe find to be vague and subject to abuse.  For example, the objective set for A.T. โ\nto โcomply 100% for three weeksโ โ is an unworkable goal.  Complicating the issue\nis the fact that A.T.โs individualized support plan (โISPโ) states that \n15   โPerson-centeredโ treatment planning is discussed in further detail in\nSection II.E.1. \n\n- 39 -\nโnoncomplianceโ is his means of letting staff know that he is not satisfied with his\nenvironment.  Given that noncompliance has this identified function, mere\nreinforcement of compliance is unlikely to have any effect and, indeed, A.T.โs data\ndemonstrate that it has not. \nInappropriate or ineffective replacement behaviors are not recognized as such\nat Howe, and are therefore not reevaluated, even when it is obvious that they are\nnot succeeding.  For instance, after a period of months in which A.B. displayed\nmarked dangerous self-injurious behavior and required mechanical restraints, the\nreplacement behavior devised was to teach A.B. to โsign โhiโ independently.โ  The \nchoice of this behavior was completely inappropriate given the nature and extent of\nher dangerous behavior, and there is little reason to think that signing โhiโ would\nhave an effect on her self-injurious behaviors.  In fact, the replacement behavior\nprogram had been in place for 18 months at the time of our tour, and the current\nsuccess rate for the behavior was 5 percent.  The success rate was 32 percent when\nthe program started.  These low and decreasing success rates obviously indicate\nthat the training program was not working.  Notably, the target behavior โ\ndangerous self-injurious behavior โ had actually increased. \nIn general, the goals set for behavioral treatment of Howe residents are far\ntoo simplistic to adequately respond to the complexity of the residentsโ issues.\nThus, residentsโ fundamental needs are not being addressed.  For example: \nโข\t  M.M. engages in the following target behaviors:  physical aggression,\nverbal aggression, property destruction, inappropriate sexual and self-\ninjurious behavior, teasing/provoking, and weapons possession.  To \naddress his issues, the procedure adopted is to ask him two questions\nevery evening about the rules for getting along with others and what to\ndo if someone does something he does not like.  Establishing the\nbehavior of correctly answering these questions is unlikely to have any\nsignificant impact on his dangerous and disturbing target behaviors.  \nโข\t  For A.U., the intervention to establish and maintain โanger\nmanagement,โ is for staff, twice a day, to prompt A.U. to count to 10\nand then inform him that the counting will help him relax.  These \ninterventions are unlikely to teach A.U. to manage his anger,\nparticularly because the prompts are not given when A.U. is angry or\nlikely to become angry, but rather are given on a set schedule. \nThe inadequate behavioral treatment approaches to self-injurious behavior\nand pica are particularly troubling at Howe.  The primary approach to managing\nthese self-injurious behaviors is to block or redirect the behaviors, rather than to\nestablish an alternative behavior.  For pica, the treatment appears to be primarily \n\n- 40 -\nenvironmental, removing or blocking access to things that might be ingested.  As a \nsafety plan, maintaining an environment free of suspected pica items is\nappropriate, although it is extremely difficult to implement comprehensively.  That \napproach, however, is inherently restrictive as a behavioral plan, and it is a barrier\nto community placement where such environmental modifications cannot be readily\nprovided.  If behavior plans are not developed whereby environmental modifications\nare gradually removed as pica is eliminated, residents will be destined to live in\nartificially restrictive environments forever. \nb. Implementation and Evaluation \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that facilities like Howe\nmonitor residents who have behavior plans to assess the residentsโ progress and the\nprogramโs efficacy.  Without accurate monitoring and evaluation, residents are in\ndanger of being subjected to inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive treatment\nand settings, as well as avoidable injuries due to untreated behaviors. \nAt Howe, the monitoring and evaluation of behavior plans substantially\ndepart from generally accepted professional standards.  The plans are unduly\nlengthy, routinely employ complicated medical terminology not readily understood\nby staff, and are not subject to peer review for quality improvement.  For example,\nC.K.โs behavior drill is seven pages long and contains 84 items that staff are\nsupposed to learn. \nThe Behavior Intervention Committee at Howe, which is supposed to provide\noversight of behavior plans, does not accomplish its function.  In particular, it does\nnot adequately address the effectiveness of behavioral interventions when\napproving psychotropic medications or restraint procedures.  In many cases dealing\nwith restraints, it does not even discuss the behavior interventions in place to\naddress the behaviors that led to the use of restraints.  Minutes from the January 9,\n2007, committee meeting illustrate this point: \nโข\t  Meeting minutes indicate that an antipsychotic medication was to be\ninitiated with C.G.  There is no indication, however, of what sign or\nsymptom the medication is intended to target, or any indication of\ndiscussion regarding what behavioral interventions were in effect to\naddress that sign or symptom. \nโข\t  Meeting minutes indicate that an antipsychotic medication and the use\nof restraints were approved for C.H.  There is no mention, however, of \nany behavioral interventions to address the behaviors that led to the\nneed for restraints or medication. \n\n- 41 -\nโข\t  Meeting minutes indicate that a medication, mobility restriction,\npersonal property restriction, person and room search, enhanced\nsupervision, and the use of 5-point restraints, were approved for A.A.\nThere is no mention, however, of any behavioral interventions to\naddress the behaviors that led to any of the restrictive interventions. \nMoreover, staff training on behavior plans is not competency-based at Howe.\nStaff training on behavior plans is currently documented by means of a sign-in\nsheet indicating who was present for the training.  Behavior drills that are \nprepared to allow trainers to document traineesโ knowledge of each aspect of the\nbehavior plan are in some cases scored 100 percent correct, although none of the\nindividual items are scored as correct or incorrect.  Moreover, the residentsโ actual \nbehavior drills do not appear to be occurring, as indicated by the relevant line on\nthe behavior plan form, โNumber of Behavior Drills (frequency over past six\nmonths),โ being routinely left blank. \nThe data collected on behavioral treatment at Howe are unreliable.  We noted \nboth missing data sheets and significant mismatches between the recorded data\nand staff narratives about a residentโs behaviors for the same period.  For example,\nwhile data collected on A.B. showed only a single instance of self-injurious behavior\nfor October 2007, notes from a Special Interdisciplinary Team Meeting stated that\nA.B. had โincreased self-injurious behavior to the point of bleeding, restraints often\nneeded.โ  The Qualitative Monthly Review Summary for October also noted that\nA.B. โhas had many injuries as a result of her [self-abusive] behavior.โ \nMembers of the Behavior Intervention Committee acknowledge that behavior\ndata are not reliable.  Even dangerous behaviors are not being adequately tracked.\nFor example, the data for A.V.โs pica behavior indicate โzeroโ instances for\nNovember 2006 through February 2007.  Yet an x-ray taken during that period\nshowed a metal spring in her digestive tract. \nHoweโs data collection and analysis regarding โprogress toward behavior\ngoalsโ are not meaningful.  There is no reflection of movement toward \nindependence, improved quality of life, or community placement.  Data regarding\nthe success of training programs are missing or ignored when decisions are made\nabout continuing the programs.  Seriously dangerous behaviors continue or increase\nwithout a judgment regarding the need to revise the behavioral intervention plan.\nMonthly reviews, for example, compare only the current month with the previous\nmonth, without interpretation, analysis of data, or any attempt to draw conclusions\nor make recommendations.  There is no consideration of long-term trends.  Training\non the same replacement behavior persists despite lack of progress over long\nperiods, such as in A.T.โs case, where his baseline success rates for two replacement \n\n- 42 -\nbehaviors were each 10 percent, and changed very little over four years.  Despite\nthese clear failures, Howe maintained A.T.โs program. \nIn cases in which it is recognized that a resident is not making progress or is\nexperiencing significant deterioration, Howe tends to respond with additional\nrestrictions, as opposed to responding with increased intensity of training, a change\nin positive intervention, or a new perspective on the problem.  For example: \nโข\t  A.W. has monthly reviews that show 0-3 percent independence for the\npica exchange program.  The monthly conclusion has always been to\nโcontinue program as written.โ  A psychologistโs note states that A.W.\nis making little progress with the pica exchange program, but\nrecommends no revisions. \nโข\t  A.B. (also discussed earlier in Section D.1.a. of this letter) required\nmultiple meetings because of her dangerous self-injurious behavior,\nbut not a single meeting resulted in a recommendation to revise the\nbehavior plan, which was to sign โhiโ independently.  Additional \nrestraints were ultimately authorized. \nโข\t  M.M. had six holding restraints, six mechanical restraints, and one\ntransport restraint in the six months preceding our tour.  The behavior \nplan, however, had remained unchanged for the previous 22 months,\nalthough it clearly was not effective in establishing a replacement for\nthe target behaviors. \n2.  Habilitation \nHabilitation includes, but is not limited to, individualized training,\neducation, and skill acquisition programs developed and implemented by\ninterdisciplinary teams to promote the growth, development, and independence of\nindividuals.  Habilitation at Howe substantially departs from the minimally\nadequate training required by the Constitution, in light of residentsโ liberty\ninterests.  Residents are being harmed because, due to inadequate habilitation\nassessments and active intervention, they are not able to build skills for success in\na more integrated environment.  While residents should be learning skills and\nsupports that they will need to pursue their personal goals and improve their\nquality of life, they are instead being trained in skills that have no real-world\napplication. \nAt Howe, habilitation assessment results are not being used to select goals.\nFor example, C.L.โs chart states that he โhas all grooming, dining, dressing,\ntoileting and domestic skills,โ but he had active programs for showering and tooth-\n\n- 43 -\nbrushing.  Moreover, the skills to be mastered are not chosen on the basis of \nmovement toward independence.  For instance, A.X.โs vocational training program\nwas to sit in a chair for 30 minutes.  The purpose of this program is unclear and no\nsupporting assessment data is provided. \nIn some cases, the training programs do not provide sufficient active \ntreatment.  On A.Y.โs individualized support plan, only one program is functional\nand appropriate (โmaintain a shared greetingโ).  Two other programs teach\nnonfunctional skills (โmatching basic objectsโ and โresponding appropriately to\nsimple questionsโ) that do not foster independence, promote community placement,\nor improve quality of life. \nVocational services at Howe are limited.  Consequently, residents are\ndeprived of opportunities to experience more rewarding vocational activities in more\nintegrated settings.  Current generally accepted professional standards increasingly\nrequire that individuals receive habilitation services in community settings where\nthe training skills are called into use.  For example, a resident would learn money\nmanagement skills by banking at a bank within the community.  Staff at Howe \nreport that vocational and day treatment options are limited because residents\nattend day activities according to which residence they live in rather than by\ninterest, strength, or goal.  Moreover, there are few employment opportunities and\njob coaches. \nWhen a resident goes to a community-based work setting, active support is\nnecessary for success.  The Howe residents who do move to community-based work\nsettings, however, do not receive the support they need.  We learned of several \nresidents who quickly lost their jobs because of inappropriate behavior.  Residents \nwho fail in community-based work settings are not offered appropriate alternative\nor remedial programming. \nAdditionally, the data collection on training programs is deficient.  During\nour November 2007 tour, we saw many blank training program data sheets for\nprograms initiated as early as February 2007.  Where there were data, the graphs\ndrawn from the data sometimes did not relate to the data on the data summary. \nEach of the data graphs drawn for A.Z., for example, showed a steady upward\ntrend, although the number of โsteps correctโ was consistently zero. \nFurther, habilitation is a safety issue, and an  individualโs safety is largely\ndependent upon the meaningful activity present in his or her life.  It is commonly\nunderstood that stimulating and challenging activities not only enhance oneโs\nquality of life through skill acquisition, but also serve as a deterrent to dangerous\nand destructive behaviors.  Skill development programs at Howe are grossly\noutdated, some by more than 20 years, adding little meaning to individualsโ lives. \n\n- 44 -\nAdditionally, our expert consultantโs extensive record review revealed that the\nmajority of residentsโ skill development programs were identical from person to\nperson, with only the name being inserted for clarity.  For example, B.A. was\nassigned a grooming goal in 1988, with no revisions indicated, which read\nidentically to othersโ grooming goals.  According to the objectives written, B.A. had\nspent nearly 20 years learning how to use a towel to dry her body. \nRepetitive or monotonous activities will not typically prevent individuals\nfrom engaging in harmful behaviors.  As the examples below illustrate, sending\nindividuals to programming sites without structured, meaningful activity will not\nprevent dangerous behaviors or serious injuries: \nโข\t  In September 2007, while at an off-site day programming activity,\nC.M. ran up to C.N. while C.N. was seated in her wheelchair, and\nflipped the wheelchair, causing C.N. to fall and be severely injured.\nStaff documented that in the future, engaging C.M. in an activity may\nprevent a similar incident from recurring. \nโข\t  Upon arriving at her workshop site in October 2007, C.O. began\nstriking herself in the head and banging her head on the floor.  Efforts \nto redirect her were unsuccessful and after 50 minutes of self abuse \nshe was transported to the local hospital for head trauma and\nnumerous self-inflicted bite wounds to her arms. \nโข\t  In September 2007, during sensory stimulation activities, B.C. fell\nasleep and tumbled from his wheelchair onto the floor.  He incurred \ninjuries to his head and knee, including a laceration on his forehead\nthat required Dermabond closure. \nFinally, an important component of habilitation, as well as behavioral\ntreatment, is effective communication therapy.  When communication skills \ndeteriorate or are not developed, residents are more likely to be unable to convey\nbasic needs and concerns, more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors as a form\nof communication, and are more likely to be at risk of bodily injury, unnecessary\npsychotropic medications, and psychological harm as a result of having no means to\nexpress needs and wants.  Failure to provide effective communication therapy\nserves to perpetuate or exacerbate individualsโ challenging behaviors, reduces their\nability to express their choices and preferences, and complicates their opportunity\nfor community placement.  Howe fails to provide its residents with adequate and\nappropriate communication therapy. \nMany Howe residents lack effective means of communication and are not\nreceiving any communication training at all.  In addition, alternative and \n\n- 45 -\naugmentative communication systems appear to be underutilized and in some cases\ninappropriately implemented.  Documentation in the charts of residents who engage\nin dangerous behavior often indicates that the team has abandoned efforts to teach\ncommunication skills.  Some residents have assessments stating a need to improve\ncommunication but have no communication training programs. \nMoreover, communication assessments do not identify the most important\nfunctional communication goals for the resident, and instead result in programs\nteaching non-functional skills.  For example, B.E. has a program that proposes four\nmonths of teaching B.E. to โpoint to the circle.โ  That is a skill with no functional \nvalue at all. \nCommunication programs that do attempt to teach functional communication\nskills often do not succeed.  This is likely because skills are taught in an artificial \ncontext.  When skills are not taught in their natural context to persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities, the behavior learned will not be generalized to the\nnatural context because of the individualโs disability.  For example, F.F.โs program\nteaches him to sign โeatโ by showing him pictures or giving him verbal prompts\nrather than by teaching him to use the sign in the natural context of eating. \nF.  INTEGRATED TREATMENT PLANNING \nMany of Howeโs difficulties in providing adequate supports and services to its\nresidents stem from the facilityโs failure to provide integrated treatment planning.\nThe purpose of integrated treatment planning is to ensure that the various\ndisciplines within the facility staff receive, communicate, and consider relevant\ninformation about an individual resident when providing supports and services to\nthat resident.  Persons with developmental disabilities residing in state institutions\nhave a constitutional right to adequate treatment, training, and medical care,\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 319, 322, that is designed to enable an individual to\nlive in the most integrated setting consistent with their needs, Olmstead, 527 U.S. \nat 607, and a critical aspect of any care and treatment is the integration of\ninformation to obtain a holistic understanding of the individual.  Without a \ncomprehensive understanding of the person, the services provided to that person\nare necessarily deficient.  Below, we discuss two important components of\nintegrated treatment planning:  (1) individualized support plans; and\n(2) interdisciplinary treatment teams.  We find that Howe is experiencing\nsignificant difficulties in both of these components, resulting in residents being\ndeprived of constitutional and statutory guarantees. \n\n- 46 -\n1.  Individualized Support Plans \nHoweโs individualized support plans (โISPsโ) do not reflect person-centered\nplanning, which is the generally accepted standard in intervention and integrated\ntreatment planning for individuals with developmental disabilities.  Person-\ncentered planning begins with the individual, examines his or her needs and\ndesired life outcomes, and captures all goals and objectives.  Person-centered \nplanning is based on preferences and strengths of individuals.  The failure to \nprovide a person-centered approach to integrated treatment planning deprives\nindividuals of opportunities to express choice and preference in selecting goals,\nundermines efforts to address challenging behaviors, compromises the effectiveness\nof habilitation programs, and inhibits the ability of Howe residents to move to more\nintegrated settings. \nISPs at Howe frequently do not include a residentโs personal goals and\npreferences, which are the hallmark of person-centered planning.  Instead, ISPs at \nHowe often contain statements such as:  โ[Residentโs name] does not have a\npersonal goal for [this area];โ or โ[Residentโs name] also doesnโt have desired\noutcome for this area.โ  Even where a goal is mentioned, the ISP often does not\nprovide the necessary supports or honor preferences or interventions that will\nachieve the residentโs goal.  The ISP for B.G, for example, lists as a personal goal,\nโto live with a family member.โ  The plan, however, does not state the barriers to\nachieving that goal, and does not provide any programs that might reasonably be\nexpected to allow B.G to take steps toward reaching that goal.    \nThe assessment process used to develop ISPs at Howe fails to identify skills\nthat are relevant to a residentโs progress toward his or her goals.  The routine \ninclusion in ISPs of a self-medication and monetary savings goals were admitted by\nstaff to be driven by the perception that those were goals required for CMS re-\ncertification of the facility. \n      \nIn general, ISPs fail to include consideration of barriers to the goal of\ncommunity placement.  Without an understanding of the barriers preventing a\nresident from being placed in the community, it is impossible to identify and\nimplement training that could move the resident closer to placement.  Many\nresidents have ISPs that fail to identify any barriers to community placement or\nany training goals that could move residents forward. \nISP meetings or reviews at Howe, which are held only annually, too often\ntake place without the resident involved, or a guardian or advocate present.  This is \na critical omission in person-centered planning.  When Special Interdisciplinary\nTeam Meetings were held to discuss A.B.โs frequent and serious self-injurious\nbehavior resulting in serious injuries, her guardian requested that an advocate \n\n- 47 -\nattend on her behalf.  Yet three meetings were held without an advocate or\nguardian, and without A.B. present. \nAdditionally, our expert consultant found the structure of ISPs at Howe to be\nexceedingly difficult to follow.  Assessment results, goals and objectives, training\nprograms, and data sheets are scattered throughout the document.  As a result, it is \ndifficult to consider the sum total of training, skill development, and overall\nservices.  This general disorganization contributes to Howeโs failure to produce ISPs\nthat reflect individualsโ choices, preferences, and needs. \n2.  Interdisciplinary Treatment Teams \nHowe does not use interdisciplinary treatment teams in its integrated\ntreatment planning.  As a result, Howe residents are deprived of coordinated\ntreatment, making intervention efforts ineffectual or inefficient.  The only\nscheduled interdisciplinary treatment team meetings at Howe are held annually as\npart of the annual ISP meetings noted in the section above.  Otherwise, there is no \nprocess for holding regular interdisciplinary team meetings to review a residentโs \nprogress.  Generally accepted professional standards require that each individualโs\ninterdisciplinary team meet at least four times a year.  Although staff reported that\nthere are โSpecial Interdisciplinary Team Meetings,โ which are called on an โas\nneededโ basis, having only regularly scheduled interdisciplinary treatment team\nmeetings once a year is contrary to both generally accepted professional standards\nand Howeโs own policy.  Howeโs Standard Operating Policy and Procedure No. 433 \nstates:  โEach month, starting from the date of the ISP, the support plan will be\nreviewed using a trans-disciplinary process to assess each personโs progress toward\nachieving the personal goals and objectives specified in the Support Plan.โ\n(Emphasis added). \nThe Interdisciplinary Treatment Team Annual Meetings that we observed\nduring our tour consisted largely of reports by individual disciplines with no\ninterdisciplinary discussion, no interdisciplinary problem solving, and no\ninterdisciplinary action planning.  Sometimes the meetings failed to include any\naction planning at all, even to address problems that had been clearly identified. \nFor instance, a Special Interdisciplinary Team Meeting called specifically to address\nB.H.โs threats of harm to a peer, a staff member, and himself, resulted in no action\nplan except observation. \nInterdisciplinary Treatment Team Annual Meetings do not demonstrate\ncollaboration between disciplines on assessment, program design, or intervention. \nMoreover, Howeโs Qualitative Monthly Review Summaries are not interdisciplinary\nin nature and as a result, lack critical information about the resident. \n\n- 48 -\nFragmentation in these records reflects the absence of a functional interdisciplinary\nprocess in treatment planning and implementation. \nWhen interdisciplinary treatment team meetings are held, essential team\nmembers are not present.  For example, when a Special Interdisciplinary Treatment\nTeam Meeting was held on November 6, 2007, to address B.I.โs exclusion from a\nworkshop because of her behavior, only residence staff and the speech therapist\nattended.  The team psychologist did not attend, although a behavior plan was\nreportedly in development.  Advocates, even when requested by a residentโs parent\nor guardian, often are not present. \nFurther, interdisciplinary treatment team meetings at Howe are not\nresponsive to the residentโs expressed preferences or concerns.  During A.W.โs\nAnnual Interdisciplinary Meeting, for example, A.W. stated a desire to move.  That \nrequest was completely ignored, and the team members made no attempt to\ndetermine what factors were motivating the request.  While it appears that Special\nInterdisciplinary Team Meetings are held when the staff requests them, we found\nno instance in which an interdisciplinary treatment team meeting was held because\nof a concern raised by a resident. \nIII.\t  REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies and protect the constitutional and\nstatutory rights of Howe residents, the State of Illinois should implement promptly,\nat a minimum, the remedial measures set forth below.  Despite the decision to close\nHowe, the constitutional violations at the facility will have continuing effects, for\nwhich the State must provide relief.  The State retains a statutory obligation to\ntransition residents to the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs.\nMany of these deficiencies could be remedied, in part, by focusing the care and\ntreatment at Howe on moving individuals into the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the residentsโ needs: \nA.\t  TRANSITION PLANNING \nProvide transition, discharge, and community placement services consistent\nwith generally accepted professional standards to all residents at Howe.  Even as \nHowe proceeds to close, the State must guarantee the residents a safe transition to\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  To this end, the facility\nshould take these steps: \n1.\t  Actively pursue the appropriate discharge of individuals residing at\nHowe and provide them with adequate and appropriate protections,\nsupports, and services, consistent with each personโs individualized \n\n- 49 -\nneeds, in the most integrated setting in which they can be reasonably\naccommodated, and where the individual does not object; \n2.\t  Set forth in reasonable detail a written transition plan specifying the\nparticular protections, supports, and services that each individual will\nor may need in order to safely and successfully transition to and live in\nthe community; \n3.\t  Develop each transition plan using person-centered planning\nprinciples.  Each transition plan should specify with particularity the\nindividualized protections, supports, and services needed to meet the\nneeds and preferences of the individual in the alternative community\nsetting, including their scope, frequency, and duration.  Each\ntransition plan should include all individually-necessary protections,\nsupports, and services, including but not limited to: \na.\t  housing and residential services; \nb.\t  transportation; \nc.\t  staffing; \nd.\t  health care and other professional services; \ne.\t  specialty health care services; \nf.\t  therapy services; \ng.\t  psychological, behavioral, and psychiatric services; \nh.\t  communication and mobility supports; \ni.\t  programming, vocational, and employment supports; and \nj.\t  assistance with activities of daily living. \n4.\t  Include in each transition plan specific details about which particular\ncommunity providers, including residential, health care, and program\nproviders, can furnish needed protections, services, and supports; \n5.\t  Emphasize the placement of residents into smaller community homes\nin its transition planning; \n\n- 50 -\n6.\t  Avoid placing residents into nursing homes or other institutional\nsettings whenever possible in its transition planning; \n7.\t  Identify in each transition plan the date the transition can occur, as\nwell as timeframes for completion of needed steps to effect the\ntransition.  Each transition plan should include the name of the person\nor entity responsible for: \na. \t commencing transition planning; \nb.\t  identifying community providers and other protections,\nsupports, and services; \nc.\t  connecting the resident with community providers; and \nd.\t  assisting in transition activities as necessary.  The responsible\nperson or entity shall be experienced and capable of performing\nthese functions. \n8.\t  Develop each transition plan sufficiently prior to potential discharge so\nas to enable the careful development and implementation of needed\nactions to occur before, during, and after the transition.  This should \ninclude identifying and overcoming, whenever possible, any barriers to\ntransition.  Howe should work closely with pertinent community\nagencies so that the protections, supports, and services that the\nindividual needs are developed and in place at the alternate site prior\nto the individualโs discharge; \n9.\t  Update the transition plans as needed throughout the planning and\ntransition process based on new information and/or developments; \n10.\t  Attempt to locate community alternatives in regions based upon the\npresence of persons significant to the individual, including parents,\nsiblings, other relatives, or close friends, where such efforts are\nconsistent with the individualโs desires; \n11.\t  Provide as many individual on-site and overnight visits to various\nproposed residential placement sites in the community as are\nappropriate and needed to ensure that the placement ultimately\nselected is, and will be, adequate and appropriate to meet the needs of\neach individual.  Howe should modify the transition plans, as needed,\nbased on these community visits; \n\n- 51 -\n12.\t  Establish in each individual transition plan a schedule for monitoring\nvisits to the new residence to assess whether the ongoing needs of the\nindividual are being met.  Each plan should specify more regular visits\nin the days and weeks after any initial placement; \n13.\t  Ensure that each individual residing at Howe be involved in the team\nevaluation, decision-making, and planning process to the maximum\nextent practicable, using whatever communication method he or she\nprefers; \n14.\t  Use person-centered planning principles at every stage of the process.\nThis should facilitate the identification of the individualโs specific\ninterests, goals, likes and dislikes, abilities and strengths, as well as\ndeficits and support needs; \n15.\t  Give each individual residing at Howe the opportunity to express a\nchoice regarding placement.  Howe should provide individuals with\nchoice counseling to help each individual make an informed choice and\nprovide enhanced counseling to those individuals who have lived at\nHowe for many years; \n16.\t  If any individual residing at Howe opposes placement, Howe should\ndocument the steps taken to ensure that any individual objection is an\ninformed one.  Howe should set forth and implement individualized\nstrategies to address concerns and objections to placement; \n17.\t  Educate individuals residing at Howe about the community and\nvarious community living options open to them on a routine basis; \n18.\t  Provide each individual with several viable placement alternatives to\nconsider whenever possible.  Howe should provide field trips to these\nviable community sites and facilitate overnight stays at certain of the\ncommunity residences, where appropriate; \n19.\t  Provide ongoing educational opportunities to family members and/or\nguardians with regard to placement and programming alternatives\nand options, when family members and/or guardians have reservations\nabout community placement.  These educational opportunities should\ninclude information about how the individual may have viable options\nother than living with the family members and/or guardians once\ndischarged from Howe.  Howe should identify and address the concerns\nof family members and/or guardians with regard to community\nplacement.  Howe should encourage family members and/or guardians \n\n- 52 -\nto participate, whenever possible, in individualsโ on-site, community\nhome field trips; \n20.\t  In coordination with the State, develop and implement a system,\nincluding service coordination services, to effectively monitor\ncommunity-based placements and programs to ensure that they are\ndeveloped in accordance with the individualized transition plans set\nforth above, and that the individuals placed are provided with the\nprotections, services, and supports they need.  These and other \nmonitoring and oversight mechanisms should serve to help protect\nindividuals from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment in their community\nresidential and other programs.  The Stateโs oversight shall include\nregular inspections of community residential and program sites;\nregular face-to-face meetings with residents and staff; and in-depth\nreviews of treatment records, incident/injury data, key-indicator\nperformance data, and other provider records; \n21.\t  Serve individuals who are placed in the community with an adequate\nnumber of service coordinators to meet individualsโ needs.  The Stateโs \nservice coordination program should provide for various levels of\nfollow-up and intervention, including more intensive service\ncoordination for those individuals leaving Howe with more complex\nneeds.  To encourage frequent individual contact, individuals leaving\nHowe should be served by service coordinators who carry a caseload of\nno more than 25 individuals at a time.  Service coordinators involved \nwith individuals from Howe with more complex and intensive needs\nwill carry a caseload of no more than 20 individuals at a time.  All \nservice coordinators should receive appropriate and adequate\nsupervision and competency-based training; \n22.\t  Provide prompt and effective support and intervention services post-\nplacement to residents who present adjustment problems related to\nthe transition process such that each individual may stay in his or her\ncommunity residence when appropriate, or be placed in a different,\nadequate, and appropriate community setting as soon as possible.\nThese services may include, but not be limited to: \na.\t  providing heightened and enhanced service coordination to the\nindividual/home; \nb.\t  providing professional consultation, expert assistance, training,\nor other technical assistance to the individual/home; \n\n- 53 -\nc.\t  providing short-term supplemental staffing and/or other\nassistance at the home as long as the problem exists; and\nd.\t  developing and implementing other community residential\nalternative solutions for the individual. \n23.\t  Regularly review various community providers and programs to\nidentify gaps and weaknesses, as well as areas of highest demand, to\nprovide information for comprehensive planning, administration,\nresource-targeting, and implementing needed remedies.  The State \nshould develop and implement effective strategies to any gaps or\nweaknesses or issues identified. \nB.\t  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nThe decision to close Howe does not relieve the State of its obligation to\nprotect resident from harm.  Therefore, Howe must provide incident, risk, and\nquality management services consistent with generally accepted professional\nstandards to all residents.  More particularly, Howe should: \n1.\t  Ensure that incidents involving injury and unusual incidents are\ntracked and analyzed. \n2.\t  Ensure that analyses are transmitted to the relevant disciplines and\ndirect-care areas for responsive action, and responses are monitored to\nensure that appropriate steps are taken. \n3.\t  Develop and implement an adequate system for identifying residents\nat high risk of being injured or causing injuries to others, and those\nresidents who instigate incidents or who are aggressive.  Develop and\nimplement plans to address the high risk situations. \n4.\t  Ensure that all staff and (to the extent possible) residents are trained\nadequately on processes for reporting abuse and neglect. \n5.\t  Ensure that all abuse and neglect investigations are conducted\nthoroughly and accord with generally accepted professional standards. \n6.\t  Impose appropriate discipline and corrective measures with respect to\nstaff involved in substantiated cases of abuse or neglect including staff\nwho fail to carry out their responsibilities while providing enhanced\nsupervision. \n\n- 54 -\nRegarding the use of restraints, Howe must ensure that any device or\nprocedure that restricts, limits, or directs a residentsโ freedom of movement\n(including, but not limited to, mechanical restraints, physical or manual restraints,\nor chemical restraints) be used only in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  To this end, Howe should take the following steps: \n1.\t  Ensure that restrictive interventions or restraints are never used as \npunishment, in lieu of training programs, or for the convenience of\nstaff, and that the least restrictive restraint techniques necessary are\nutilized, and that restraint use is minimized. \n2.\t  Develop and implement a policy on restraints and restrictive measures\nthat comports with current, generally accepted professional standards. \n3.\t  Prohibit the use of mechanical restraints as part of behavioral\ntreatment plans and programs, and limit the use of mechanical\nrestraints to true emergency situations in which there is no other\nmeans of protecting the resident or others. \nC.\t  HEALTH CARE \nProvide medical care, nursing, and therapy services consistent with generally\naccepted professional standards to residents who need such services.  Howe must \nprovide adequate health care even as it proceeds toward closure.  To this end, Howe \nshould take these steps: \n1.\t  Provide each resident with proactive, coordinated, and collaborative\nhealth care and therapy planning and treatment based on his or her\nindividualized needs. \n2.\t  Develop and implement strategies to secure and retain adequate\nnumbers of trained nursing staff. \n3.\t  Clarify policies and procedures regarding communication and\ncoordination of care between medical providers and specialists to\nensure that findings and recommendations are addressed promptly. \n4.\t  Develop and implement an adequate system of documentation to\nensure timely, accurate, and thorough recording of all medical and\nnursing care provided to Howeโs residents. \n\n- 55 -\n5.\t  Conduct regular audits to assess the quality of all medical\ndocumentation, timeliness of filing documents, and the overall\norganization of the chart. \n6.\t  Provide competency-based training, consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards, to staff in the areas of:  basic emergency\nresponse and first aid, infection control procedures, skin care, and\nmeal plans. \n7.\t  Ensure that medical staff is capable of recognizing, assessing, and\nmanaging the physical pain of the residents. \n8.\t  Develop and implement criteria by which residents with the highest\nnutritional and physical risks are identified, assessed, and provided\nthe appropriate nutritional and physical therapy and supports. \n9.\t  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all residents using mobility,\ntherapeutic positioning, or other assistive technology supports, to\ndetermine appropriateness of the technology support and to set\nmeasurable outcome goals. \n10.\t  Clarify policies and procedures regarding prompt communication\nbetween pharmacy staff and prescribing physicians when medication\nconcerns arise, so that modifications in the medication regimen can be\nmade without unnecessary delay.   \n11.\t  Ensure that residents have routine dental examinations every six\nmonths, with oral x-rays being completed on an annual basis. \n12.\t  Ensure that comprehensive dental assessments are recorded in the\nmedical record.   \n13.\t  Provide adequate positioning to residents at risk of dysphagia during\ndental visits. \n14.\t  Provide quality assurance programs, including medical peer review\nand quality improvement systems, to regularly evaluate the adequacy\nof medical care. \nD.  \tPSYCHIATRIC CARE \nProvide psychiatric services consistent with generally accepted professional\nstandards to residents who need such services.  The Stateโs decision to close Howe \n\n- 56 -\ndoes not alter the obligation of Howe to provide adequate psychiatric care to its\nresidents.  To this end, Howe should take these steps: \n1.\t  Develop standard psychological and psychiatric assessment and\ninterview protocols for reliably reaching a psychiatric diagnosis, and\nuse these protocols to assess each resident upon admission for possible\npsychiatric disorders. \n2.\t  Undertake a thorough psychiatric evaluation of all residents currently\nresiding at Howe, provide a clinically justifiable current diagnosis for\neach resident, and remove all diagnoses that cannot be clinically\njustified. \n3.\t  Clarify policies and procedures regarding communication and\ncoordination of care between medical providers and psychiatric care\nspecialists to ensure that findings and recommendations are addressed\npromptly. \n4.\t  Conduct adequate monitoring of individuals on antipsychotic\nmedications for movement disorders. \n5.\t  Develop and implement a system to assess and refer individuals for\nindividual and group therapy, as necessary. \nE.\t  BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT AND HABILITATION \nProvide residents with training, including behavioral and habilitative\nservices, consistent with generally accepted professional standards to residents who\nneed such services.  These services should be developed by qualified professionals\nconsistent with accepted professional standards to reduce or eliminate risks to\npersonal safety, to reduce or eliminate unreasonable use of bodily restraints, to\nprevent regression, and to facilitate the growth, development, and independence of\nevery resident.  These services should be developed and received by residents\ndespite the Stateโs to close Howe.  To this end, Howe should take the following \nsteps: \n1.\t  Develop standard protocols for efficient, accurate collection of\nbehavioral data, including relevant contextual information. \n2.\t  Develop standard psychological assessment and interview protocols.\nEnsure in these protocols that possible medical, psychiatric, and or\nother motivations for target behaviors are considered. \n\n- 57 -\n3.\t  Use these protocols to endure that functional behavioral assessments\nand findings about behaviors are adequately substantiated, current,\nand complete. \n4. \t Ensure that behavioral treatment plans are written at a level that can\nbe understood and implemented by direct-care staff. \n5.\t  Ensure that outcomes of behavioral treatment plans include\nfundamental objectives, such as reduction in use of medication,\nenhanced learning opportunities, and greater community integration. \n6.\t  Ensure that outcomes are frequently monitored, and that assessments\nand treatments are re-evaluated promptly if target behaviors do not\nimprove. \n           \n7.\t  Ensure that all residents receive meaningful habilitation daily. \n8.\t  Provide a habilitation assessment of all residents and develop and\nimplement plans based on these assessments to ensure that residents\nare receiving vocational and/or day programming services in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to meet their needs. \nF. \t INTEGRATED TREATMENT PLANNING \nProvide supports, services, and planning that are integrated across\ndisciplines, consistent with generally accepted professional standards, to all\nresidents at Howe.  To this end, Howe should take these steps even while it moves \ntoward closure: \n1.\t  Ensure that ISPs integrate information across disciplines and reflect\ncollaboration between disciplines. \n2.\t  Ensure that ISPs demonstrate individualized planning, including the\nindividualโs needs, strengths, goals, and preferences. \n3.\t  Develop and implement ISPs that include a section on transition and\ndischarge planning, including the barriers to community placement\nand the facilityโs plan to address those barriers. \n4.\t  Ensure that ISPs are understandable to the individual served or their \nguardian. \n\n- 58 -\n5.\t  Ensure that interdisciplinary treatment team meetings integrate\ninformation across disciplines and reflect collaboration between\ndisciplines, and that the integration and collaboration are\nappropriately documented. \n6.\t  Ensure that individuals necessary to obtaining a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the resident, including direct care staff and the\nindividual who is the subject of the meeting or their guardian, are\nincluded in the interdisciplinary treatment team process. \n7.\t  Ensure that action plans are developed and implemented to address\nthe needs and/or issues identified in those meetings, including but not\nlimited to inappropriate behaviors or use of restraint. \n8.\t  Ensure that transition and discharge planning, including barriers to\nplacement, are routinely discussed at interdisciplinary treatment team\nmeetings. \n*   *   * \nWe hope to continue working with the State of Illinois in an amicable and\ncooperative fashion to resolve our outstanding concerns with regard to Howe. \nPlease note that this findings letter is a public document.
