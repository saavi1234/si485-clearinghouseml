Rather, they request the creation of a second majority-minority district in which they may or may not reside.

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about dilution of African American voting strength by congressional districting in Alabama. On 13 June 2018, eight African American voters residing in Alabama filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama Southern Division. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge John E Ott, and reassigned to Chief Judge Karon O Bowdre. The plaintiffs sued the Alabama Secretary of State. The plaintiffs claimed that Alabama&rsquo;s congressional districting plan based on the 2010 federal census violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. &sect; 10301, by &ldquo;packing&rdquo; and &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; African American voters between congressional districts to dilute African American voting strength, such that African Americans had less opportunity to elect representatives of their choice than other members of the electorate. They sought a declaration that the current districting scheme was unconstitutional, an injunction preventing Alabama from giving effect to the current district boundaries or conducting elections using those boundaries, and an order for the adoption of a valid congressional districting plan that included a second majority-minority district.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 9 July 2018, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit because the remedy they sought, of a valid congressional districting plan, would not redress the alleged racially-gerrymandered districts. On 16 July 2018, the court ordered the plaintiffs to show cause. In response, on 23 July 2018, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint and a response to the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs argued that the motion to dismiss was based on a misinterpretation of their vote dilution claim brought under Section 2 Voting Rights Act with racial gerrymandering claims brought under the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also held that, because they had only alleged a statutory Section 2 claim &ndash; not a constitutional claim &ndash; the case was properly brought before a single district judge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 6 August 2018, the defendant filed an answer to the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint, admitting to several of the plaintiffs&rsquo; factual allegations, but denying that Alabama&rsquo;s constitutional districting plan violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. On 8 August 2018, the court entered an initial order governing all further proceedings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 27 August 2018, an Alabama Senator submitted a motion to intervene as a defendant in his official capacity as Alabama Senator and member of Alabama Legislature&rsquo;s Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment which had drawn up Alabama&rsquo;s congressional districting plan, together with a proposed response to the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint. However on 16 October 2018, the court denied the motion to intervene on the basis that the Alabama Senator had failed to demonstrate why he had a claim or defense in this case not already adequately represented by the state Attorney General.</p>\r\n<p>On 2 November 2018, the defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that jurisdiction lay with a three-judge panel because the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim was in essence a constitutional one, that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a viable remedy, and that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were barred by the doctrine of laches. On 30 November 2018, the plaintiffs filed their brief in opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On 28 January 2019, the court entered a memorandum opinion and order finding that the case did not require a three-judge panel to establish jurisdiction because it was filed purely under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and did not raise a constitutional challenge to the apportionment of congressional districts. On 27 March 2019, the court then entered a separate memorandum opinion and order addressing the remaining arguments in the defendants&rsquo; motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court found that the plaintiffs sufficiently pled the ability to create a second majority-minority congressional district to defeat the assertion that they had not pled a viable remedy. However, the court found that, pursuant to the doctrine of laches, the delay by the plaintiffs in bringing their suit barred any relief except for declaratory relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Between 4 November and 8 November 2019, the court held a bench trial in which the plaintiffs and the defendant offered expert and lay testimony regarding whether Alabama&rsquo;s congressional districting complies with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 17 March 2020, the court declared the case moot and dismissed it without prejudice. The court held that &ndash; based on the unavailability of injunctive relief, the inevitable change in census numbers, and the binding nature of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act &ndash; the court could not offer effective relief, as the requested declaratory judgment could not be granted in time for the 2020 congressional elections.</p>",

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR  \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n \n \nLAKEISHA CHESTNUT, an individual; \nCase No. _______________ \nMARLENE MARTIN, an individual; BOBBY \nDUBOSE, an individual; RODNEY LOVE, an \nindividual; JANICE WILLIAMS, an individual;   \nKAREN JONES, an individual; RODERICK \nCLARK, an individual; JOHN HARRIS, an \nindividual, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nJOHN H. MERRILL, in his official capacity as \nAlabama Secretary of State,  \nDefendant. \n \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  Plaintiffs bring this voting rights action to challenge Alabama Act No. 2011-518 \n(“S.B. 484”), now codified at Ala. Code § 17-14-70, on the grounds that it violates Section 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301. \n2.  Under S.B. 484, the Alabama legislature carefully distributed African-American \nvoters between four congressional districts, diluting African-American voting strength and \nconfining African-American voting power to one majority-minority district.  \n3.  S.B. 484 “packs” African-American voters into the Seventh Congressional \nDistrict (“CD 7”) and “cracks” African-American voters among three other congressional \ndistricts—Congressional Districts 1, 2, and 3—despite the fact that the African-American \npopulation in these areas could have been united to form an additional majority-minority \ncongressional district in which African-American voters would have the opportunity to elect \ntheir candidates of choice. In this way, S.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 2 of 30\n4.  CD 7 was established as a majority-minority district in the wake of Congress’s \n1982 amendment to the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited voting practices that produced \nracially discriminatory results, regardless of whether the challenged practice had been adopted \nwith the intent to discriminate. As a result, in 1992, for the first time since Reconstruction, \nAfrican-American voters who lived in CD 7 were able to elect their candidate of choice—Earl F. \nHilliard, an African American—to Congress. Today, CD 7 is represented by Democratic \nRepresentative Terri Sewell, an African American who was first elected in 2010.  \n5.  Under Act No. 2002-57, which was enacted in 2002 and established Alabama’s \ncongressional redistricting plan following the 2000 Census, the Black Voting Age Population \n(“BVAP”) of CD 7 was 58.33%. Under S.B. 484, which was enacted in 2011 and established \nAlabama’s congressional redistricting plan following the 2010 Census, the legislature increased \nthe BVAP of CD 7 from 58.33% to 60.91%.  \n6.  The African-American population in Alabama is sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact to form a majority of eligible voters in two congressional districts.  \n7.  African-American residents of Alabama, including in the Black Belt, have \nsuffered from a long history of marginalization and discrimination, including, as alleged here, the \ndilution of African-American voting strength through redistricting. When African Americans \nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to elect a representative of their \nchoice to the U.S. House of Representatives to advocate on their behalf, the result is systemic \nneglect of their needs and concerns.  \n8.  As evidenced by an array of factors, such as the history of racial discrimination in \nvoting, the perpetuation of racial appeals in Alabama elections, and the socio-economic effects \nof decades of discrimination against African Americans that hinder their ability to participate \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 3 of 30\neffectively in the political process, Alabama’s failure to create a second majority-minority \ncongressional district in S.B. 484 has resulted in the dilution of African-American voting \nstrength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \n9.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order (i) declaring that S.B. 484 violates Section 2 \nof the Voting Rights Act; (ii) enjoining Defendant from conducting future elections under S.B. \n484; (iii) ordering a congressional redistricting plan that includes two majority-minority \ncongressional districts; and (iv) providing any such additional relief as is appropriate.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and \n1988, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1343(a)(4), and 1357. \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 2202.  \n12.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff LaKeisha Chestnut is an African-American citizen of the United States \nand of the State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Mobile County in CD 1. \nMs. Chestnut has resided in CD 1 since 2016. In 2016, Ms. Chestnut, who votes Democratic, was \ngiven no opportunity to elect her candidate of choice because the Republican candidate was \nunopposed. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of \nMobile County to provide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of \none majority-minority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority \npopulation in Alabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting \nRights Act, dilutes Ms. Chestnut’s voting power and denies her the equal opportunity to vote for \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 4 of 30\na candidate of her choice to the U.S. House of Representatives. \n14.  Plaintiff Marlene Martin is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Montgomery County in CD 7. \nMs. Martin is denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority \ndistrict to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. Martin’s voting power. \n15.  Plaintiff Bobby DuBose is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Jefferson County in CD 7. Mr. \nDuBose is denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because he is packed in CD 7, where his vote is of lesser value because African-\nAmerican voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority district to \nthe sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in Alabama, as \nopposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Mr. \nDuBose’s voting power. \n16.  Plaintiff Rodney Love is an African-American citizen of the United States and of \nthe State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Jefferson County in CD 7. Mr. \nLove has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because he is packed in CD 7, where his vote is of lesser value because African-\nAmerican voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority district to \nthe sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in Alabama, as \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 5 of 30\nopposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Mr. \nLove’s voting power. \n17.  Plaintiff Janice Williams is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Jefferson County in CD 7. Ms. \nWilliams has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority \ndistrict to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. William’s voting power. \n18.  Plaintiff Karen Jones is an African-American citizen of the United States and of \nthe State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Montgomery County in CD 7. Ms. \nJones has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority \ndistrict to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. Jones’s voting power. \n19.  Plaintiff Roderick Clark is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Bullock County in CD 2. Mr. \nClark has been unable to elect candidates of his choice to the U.S. House of Representatives \ndespite strong electoral support for those candidates from other African-American voters in his \ncommunity. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 6 of 30\nBullock County to provide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of \none majority-minority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority \npopulation in Alabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting \nRights Act, dilutes Mr. Clark’s voting power and denies him the equal opportunity to vote for a \ncandidate of his choice to the U.S. House of Representatives. \n20.  Plaintiff John Harris is an African-American citizen of the United States and of \nthe State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Lee County in CD 3. Mr. Harris has \nbeen unable to elect candidates of his choice to the U.S. House of Representatives despite strong \nelectoral support for those candidates from other African-American voters in his community. An \nadditional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of Lee County to \nprovide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of one majority-\nminority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Mr. Harris’s voting power and denies him the equal opportunity to vote for a candidate of \nhis choice to the U.S. House of Representatives. \n21.  Defendant John H. Merrill is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary of State \nof Alabama. The Secretary of State is the State’s chief election officer. Ala. Code § 17-1-3(a). In \nthat capacity, he is responsible for providing uniform guidance for election activities and \nimplementing election laws and regulations. See Ala. Admin. Code r. 820-2-1 - 820-2-4. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n22.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a), prohibits any \n“standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color[.]” Thus, in addition to prohibiting \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 7 of 30\npractices that deny outright the exercise of the right to vote, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \nprohibits vote dilution. A violation of Section 2 is established if it is shown that, “the political \nprocesses leading to nomination or election” in the jurisdiction “are not equally open to \nparticipation by [minority voters] in that its members have less opportunity than other members \nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their \nchoice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).  \n23.  The dilution of African-American voting strength “may be caused by the dispersal \nof blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from the \nconcentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.”  Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986).  \n24.  The United States Supreme Court, in Thornburg v. Gingles, identified three \nnecessary preconditions (“the Gingles preconditions”) for a claim of vote dilution under Section \n2 of the Voting Rights Act: (1) the minority group must be “sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”; (2) the minority group must be \n“politically cohesive”; and (3) the majority must vote “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . \nusually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. at 50-51. \n25.  Once all three preconditions are established, the statute directs courts to consider \nwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, members of a racial group have less opportunity \nthan other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect \nrepresentatives of their choice. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). The Senate Report on the 1982 \namendments to the Voting Rights Act identifies several non-exclusive factors that courts should \nconsider when determining if, under the totality of the circumstances in a jurisdiction, the \noperation of the electoral device being challenged results in a violation of Section 2.  \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 8 of 30\n26.  These Senate factors include: (1) the history of official voting-related \ndiscrimination in the state or political subdivision; (2) the extent to which voting in the elections \nof the state or political subdivision is racially polarized; (3) the extent to which the state or \npolitical subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity \nfor discrimination against the minority group, such as unusually large election districts, majority-\nvote requirements, and prohibitions against bullet-voting; (4) the exclusion of members of the \nminority group from candidate slating processes; (5) the extent to which minority group \nmembers bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, \nwhich hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; (6) the use of overt or \nsubtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and (7) the extent to which members of the minority \ngroup have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.  \n27.  The Senate Report itself and the cases interpreting it have made clear that “there \nis no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them \npoint one way or the other.” United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1566 n.33 \n(11th Cir. 1984) (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29 (1982)); see also id. (“The statute explicitly \ncalls for a ‘totality-of-the circumstances’ approach and the Senate Report indicates that no \nparticular factor is an indispensable element of a dilution claim.”). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n28.  In June 2011, the Alabama legislature passed legislation to redraw Alabama’s \nseven congressional districts, as set forth at Ala. Code § 17-14-70. \n29.  On May 26, 2011, S.B. 484 passed in the Alabama Senate on a 19-11 vote over \nthe objection of all seven of the state’s African-American senators. On June 1, 2011, S.B. 484 \npassed the House on a 65-37 vote.  \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 9 of 30\n30.  Prior to the passage of S.B. 484, Joe Reed, who was the Alabama Democratic \nParty’s vice chairman for minority affairs at the time, asked leaders of the Alabama Legislative \nCommittee on Reapportionment to explore the possibility of creating a second majority African-\nAmerican congressional district in Alabama. Nonetheless, S.B. 484 included only the existing \nmajority-minority district and failed to create an additional district in which African Americans \nwould have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.  \n31.  Alabama Governor Bentley signed S.B. 484 into law on June 8, 2011.  \n32.  S.B. 484 was sponsored or co-sponsored by four white Republican state \nsenators—Senators Gerald Dial, Jimmy Holley, Trip Pittman, and Clay Scofield. Senator Dial \nalso helped draw the 2011 Alabama state legislative redistricting plan, which was declared \nunconstitutional because three state senate and nine state house districts were drawn as illegal \nracial gerrymanders. See Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1038 \n(M.D. Ala. 2017). The same political consultant, Randy Hinaman, drew both the state legislative \nand congressional districts following the 2010 Census. Id.  \n33.  CD 7 is the only majority-minority district in S.B. 484. It is heavily black and \npacks in almost one-third of Alabama’s African-American population. CD 7 has been \nrepresented by an African American since 1992. It is currently represented by Representative \nTerri Sewell, who was first elected in 2010.  \n34.  CD 7 includes Choctaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Marengo, Pickens, \nPerry, Sumter, and Wilcox counties, as well as portions of Clarke, Jefferson, Montgomery, and \nTuscaloosa counties.  \n35.  The prior version of CD 7 had a BVAP of 58.33%. Before Representative Sewell \ntook office, Artur Davis, an African-American Democrat, held the office from 2002 until 2010. \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 10 of 30\nIn each of his general elections, Davis either won handily or ran unopposed.   \n36.  In the 2011 redistricting process, the Alabama legislature increased the district’s \nBVAP to 60.91% despite CD 7’s strong history of African-American representation since its \nestablishment as a majority-minority district. \n37.  S.B. 484 moved African Americans from majority-white districts into CD 7, \nheavily concentrating African Americans in the district and diluting their influence in adjacent \ndistricts.   \n38.  Representative Sewell ran in 2010 and won in a landslide election with \napproximately 72% of the vote. After the enactment of S.B. 484, Representative Sewell won re-\nelection in 2012 with approximately 75% of the vote. In both the 2014 and 2016 general \nelections she ran unopposed. \n39.  S.B. 484 “packs” African-American voters into CD 7 and “cracks” African-\nAmerican population centers among other districts, preventing the emergence of a second \ncongressional district in which minorities would have an opportunity to elect their candidates of \nchoice.  \n40.  By unpacking CD 7’s African-American population and combining it with \nAfrican-American populations in other districts such as CDs 1, 2, and 3, the Alabama legislature \ncould have drawn two majority-minority districts in S.B. 484, as required by Section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act.  \n41.  Each of the three districts among which the African-American population is \nsignificantly cracked—CDs 1, 2, and 3—includes at least one heavily African-American area in \nan otherwise majority-white district. For example, CD 3 contains Macon County, which is home \nto the historically African-American college Tuskegee University and has an African-American \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 11 of 30\npopulation of 82.6%. Similarly, CD 1 includes Mobile County, which has an African-American \npopulation of 34.6%, and Monroe County, which has an African-American population of 41.7%. \nMontgomery County, which has an African-American population of 54.7%, is split between CDs \n2, 3, and 7. The African-American population in the eastern portion of Alabama is split neatly in \ntwo by the border between CDs 2 and 3. \n42.  The Black Belt is located in the south-central region of Alabama. The region was \noriginally named for its black soil, but over time the term has also been used to refer to counties \nwith a large black population. A large African-American population resides in the Black Belt and \nits surrounding area because of the history of agriculture and slavery in that region. Booker T. \nWashington said in 1901 that the Black Belt was “the part of the South where the slaves were \nmost profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers.” According to \nthe Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama, the “traditional \ncounties” of the Alabama Black Belt include: Sumter, Choctaw, Greene, Hale, Marengo, Perry, \nDallas, Wilcox, Lowndes, Butler, Crenshaw, Montgomery, Macon, Bullock, Pike, Barbour, and \nRussell. The traditional Black Belt is surrounded by counties that also have substantial African-\nAmerican populations, including but not limited to, Washington, Mobile, Clarke, Escambia, and \nMonroe counties.  \n43.  In S.B. 484, the Black Belt and the surrounding area is split among four \ncongressional districts—CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7.  \nRacial Polarization \n44.  African-American voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and overwhelmingly \nsupport Democratic candidates.  \n45.  The white majority, which overwhelmingly supports Republican candidates, votes \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 12 of 30\nas a bloc usually to defeat African-American voters’ candidates of choice.  \n46.  For example, according to CNN exit polling in the 2017 special election for the \nU.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, 96% of African-American voters \nsupported Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Senator Jones won 15 of the 17 counties that \ncomprise the “traditional counties” of the Black Belt listed in Paragraph 42 herein. When the \nelection is viewed through the lens of the state’s seven congressional districts, Senator Jones won \nonly one—CD 7. \n47.  In the 2016 presidential election, over 80% of African-American voters voted for \nthe Democratic candidate, while fewer than 20% of white voters statewide (and fewer than 15% \nof white voters in the Black Belt) voted for the Democratic candidate. African-American voters’ \ncandidate of choice lost the statewide vote by a margin of 27.7 percentage points.   \n48.  The last time voters in CD 1 elected an African American to represent them in \nCongress was during Reconstruction. While more than a quarter of the voting age population in \nCD 1 is African-American, white Republicans have been continuously elected to represent CD 1 \nsince 1965.  \n49.  African-American Democrat Burton LeFlore has sought election to the U.S. \nHouse to represent CD 1 twice. Both times LeFlore, the African-American voters’ candidate of \nchoice, was defeated by Bradley Byrne, a white Republican, in wide margins that reflect the \nstrongly racially polarized voting in the state. First, in a special election in 2013, despite strong \nAfrican-American support for LeFlore, Byrne won in a landslide victory, receiving \napproximately two-thirds of the vote. A publicly reported precinct-by-precinct analysis of the \nvote in Mobile and Baldwin counties showed that Byrne was the overwhelming favorite \neverywhere—except in areas of CD 1 with large concentrations of African Americans. In the \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 13 of 30\n2014 general election, LeFlore was again soundly defeated.  \n50.  Without exception, federal courts have found that voting in Alabama is and \nremains severely racially polarized. In 1983, in Buskey v. Oliver, the U.S. District Court for the \nMiddle District of Alabama found that the City of Montgomery, which is the county seat of \nMontgomery County and is located in the Black Belt, is “a city still polarized by race, with only \nwhite council members being elected from predominantly white council districts and with only \nblack council members being elected from predominantly black council districts.” Buskey v. \nOliver, 565 F. Supp. 1473, 1482 (M.D. Ala. 1983).     \n51.  In United States v. Dallas County Commission, 739 F.2d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir. \n1984), the Eleventh Circuit found that racially polarized voting existed in Dallas County \nelections for the period 1966 through 1978. On remand, the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Alabama found that based on evidence from election contests between 1978 and 1986, \nvoting patterns in Dallas County remained polarized along racial lines to a sufficient degree to \nwarrant the conclusion that, when combined with the use of a majority vote requirement in the \nprimary and the use of numbered posts, the at-large system for electing county commissioners in \nDallas County violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. United States v. Dallas Cty. Comm’n, \n636 F. Supp. 704, 710 (S.D. Ala.), rev’d on other grounds, 791 F.2d 831 (1986).   \n52.  In 2002, in Dillard v. Baldwin County Commission, the court found that, “[t]he \nplaintiffs have shown that black citizens of Baldwin County still suffer from the racially \npolarized voting and from historically depressed conditions, economically and socially.” Dillard \nv. Baldwin County Comm’n, 222 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002), aff’d, 376 F.3d 1260 \n(11th Cir. 2004).  \n53.  Federal courts in Alabama have acknowledged the causal connection between \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 14 of 30\nracial bloc voting and the history of de jure segregation: “Racial bloc voting by whites is \nattributable in part to past discrimination, and the past history of segregation and discrimination \naffects the choices of voters at the polls.” Brown v. Bd. of School Comm’rs of Mobile Cty., 542 F. \nSupp. 1078, 1094 (S.D. Ala. 1982), aff’d, 706 F.2d 1103 (11th Cir. 1983), aff’d 464 U.S. 1005 \n(1983). \nHistory of Official Voting-Related Discrimination \n54.  In addition to the three Gingles preconditions noted above, the totality of the \ncircumstances in this case supports Plaintiffs’ claim that African-American voters in Alabama \nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process \nand elect representatives of their choice to Congress, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act.  \n55.  Few, if any, states rival Alabama’s notorious history of state-sponsored racial \ndiscrimination against African Americans, particularly in the voting context. Historically, and \ncontinuing through today, Alabama has implemented voting practices that have hindered African \nAmericans’ ability to participate equally in the political process. \n56.  The history goes as far back as the post-Civil War era. Despite the passage of the \nReconstruction Amendments after the Civil War and the fact that African-American men were \ngiven the franchise under the Alabama Constitution of 1867—which allowed every male person \n21 years of age or older who satisfied the citizenship and residence requirements to vote—the \nAlabama legislature moved swiftly to undo these gains.  \n57.  The Alabama legislature adopted a new state constitution in 1875 and \nsubsequently passed a series of local laws eliminating elections for county commissioners, \ninstead giving the governor the power to appoint the commissioners. These laws were designed \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 15 of 30\nto prevent the election of African-American county commissioners.  \n58.  During Reconstruction, black voters were frequently violently intimidated and \neven killed by white paramilitary groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and a notorious group \ncalled the “White League.” In the lead-up to the 1870 gubernatorial election, for example, in \nGreene County, Ku Klux Klansmen verbally harassed and violently attacked black voters at a \npolitical rally at the county courthouse where approximately 2,000 African-American \nRepublican voters were gathered. The Klan’s violent tactics had their intended result: black \nvoters stayed away from the polls in fear of more violence, and the results of the 1870 election \nreflected the absence of black Republican voting power. In the 1868 presidential election, \nGreene County voted for Republican Ulysses S. Grant by a margin of 2,000 votes; by contrast in \nthe 1870 gubernatorial election, Greene County supported Democrat Robert B. Lindsay by a \nmargin of 43.  \n59.  On election day, November 3, 1874, an Alabama chapter of the White League \nformed a mob, invaded Barbour County and killed seven African-American Republican voters \nand injured at least 70 more. The White League subsequently refused to count any Republican \nvotes cast in the election, declared the Democrats victorious, and seized every county office in \nBarbour County.  \n60.  In 1901, Alabama held a Constitutional Convention, the purpose of which was to \nenshrine in the state constitution the disenfranchisement of African Americans. The President of \nthe Constitutional Convention, John B. Knox, stated in his inaugural address that the intention of \nthe convention was “to establish white supremacy in this State.” The Convention ratified changes \nto the constitution that required voters to pass literacy tests as a prerequisite to registering to \nvote. A grandfather clause exempted anyone who had served in the military or descended from \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 16 of 30\nveterans. The intent and effect of the grandfather clause was to ensure that illiterate white \nresidents could still register to vote, as African Americans had been precluded from serving in \nthe military.  \n61.  The ratified Constitution also required voters to pay a cumulative poll tax of $1.50 \nevery year. Though color blind on its face, the poll tax was intended to and had the effect of \ndisenfranchising African Americans. At the 1901 Constitutional Convention, Delegate Hood \nvoiced his approval of the poll tax because of the detrimental effect it would have on African \nAmericans: “Now in my judgment, this poll tax qualification is the most important provision in \nthis entire article. We are told that in the Black Belt and that in many counties in the state, there \nis a large percentage of those young Negroes who are coming of age that will be able to read and \nwrite, therefore will be qualified under the provisions of this article. The only safety valve, Mr. \nPresident, that is contained in this article after 1903 for a large proportion of the Negroes in this \nState is this Poll tax of $1.50.” United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. 95, 99 (M.D. Ala. 1966).   \n62.  After the passage of the 1901 constitution, segregation progressed rapidly, as \npublic spaces were increasingly either separated or reserved for whites alone. By 1913, a black \nsociologist concluded that African Americans in Mobile lived in an isolated world, utterly \nseparate from whites in most aspects of life and even death, with blacks and whites being buried \nin separate cemeteries.  \n63.  Because of low education rates, African Americans were forced to use their \nbodies to generate income by providing unskilled physical labor. Particularly in the Black Belt, \nAfrican Americans became sharecroppers and tenant farmers in large numbers. The economic \npicture for African Americans was bleak. By the end of the 20th century, Black Belt counties \ncontained more than 50 percent rates of child poverty, double-digit unemployment numbers, and \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 17 of 30\nmedian incomes half to three-fourths of the national average. These facts made the Black Belt, \nwhich was seen as some of America’s richest land, its poorest.  \n64.  Like other southern states, Alabama passed Jim Crow laws that legalized \nsegregation and ensured that African Americans would be treated as second-class citizens. For \nexample, in 1942, the Alabama legislature passed a resolution commending its U.S. Senators for \n“their magnificent fight against the measure now pending in Congress which is calculated to \ndestroy our Poll Tax Law,” fearing that the United States Senate would soon pass anti-poll tax \nlegislation. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. at 102. Alabama’s poll tax remained in effect until it was \ndeclared unconstitutional by a federal district court in 1966. See id. at 104. \n65.  In 1957, the Alabama legislature transformed the boundaries of the city of \nTuskegee to a twenty-eight-sided figure designed to fence out African Americans from the city \nlimits so that only whites could elect city officials, an action the U.S. Supreme Court found \nunconstitutional in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960).  \n66.  After the Supreme Court banned the use of white primaries in Smith v. Allwright, \n321 U.S. 649 (1944), Alabama legislators were openly and unabashedly intent on finding new \nstrategies to keep African Americans out of the electoral process. In the 1950s, the legislature \npassed a bill outlawing single-shot voting in municipal elections conducted at-large. Single-shot \nvoting generally “enables a minority group to win some at-large seats if it concentrates its vote \nbehind a limited number of candidates and if the vote of the majority is divided among a number \nof candidates.” City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 184 n.19 (1980) (citation omitted), \nabrogated by Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). A law banning single-shot voting \ngenerally requires that each elector cast votes for as many candidates as there are positions. Such \na law disadvantages minority voters “because it may force them to vote for nonminority \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 18 of 30\ncandidates, thus depreciating the relative position of minority candidates.” Nevett v. Sides, 571 \nF.2d 209, 217 n.10 (5th Cir. 1978).  \n67.  The laws banning single-shot voting were repealed in 1961 and replaced with \nlaws requiring candidates to run for numbered places in all state, county, and municipal at-large \nelections. Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1357 (1986). The numbered place laws \nhad the same dilutive effect on African-American voting strength in at-large elections as the laws \nbanning single-shot voting.  \n68.  The gravity of Alabama’s discrimination and brutality against African-American \nvoters was on display in places like Selma, where in 1964 and 1965, Dallas County Sheriff Jim \nClark infamously—and violently—resisted African-American voter registration efforts and \npeaceful protests to gain access to the franchise. \n69.  In March 1965, police officers assaulted unarmed marchers crossing the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, where less than 5% of African Americans were registered to vote. The \nevent, televised across American television screens, became known as “Bloody Sunday.” The \npublicity the march received helped pave the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act in \nAugust 1965.  \n70.  Alabama was declared a “covered” state under Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights \nAct based on the state’s enforcement of unconstitutional devices or tests, including voucher \nrequirements, together with low minority voter registration and turnout rates. See South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 312-13 (1966), abrogated by Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. \n529 (2013). As a covered jurisdiction, Alabama was required to have any changes to its election \npractices or procedures “precleared” by either the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal court.  \n71.  Between 1965 and 2013, when the Supreme Court effectively barred enforcement \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 19 of 30\nof the Section 5 preclearance requirement in Shelby County v. Holder, the federal government’s \nindependent oversight helped protect Alabama’s African-American voters against \ndisenfranchisement and arbitrary and disparate treatment by the state in its election practices and \nprocedures. While Section 5 was in effect, at least 100 voting changes proposed by the State of \nAlabama were blocked or altered pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. See U.S. Dep’t \nof Justice, Civil Rights Division, Voting Section, Voting Determination Letters for Alabama, \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crt/records/vot/obj_letters/state_letters.php?state=al (last updated Aug. 7, \n2015) (listing all objections imposed against Alabama under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act).   \n72.  In 2006, during the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress was \nprovided with extensive evidence documenting the Alabama legislature’s and other state actors’ \nsustained record of unconstitutional and illegal voting discrimination practices. See, e.g., \nRenewing the Temporary Provisions of the Voting Rights Act: Legislative Options after LULAC \nv. Perry: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights \nof the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 365-402 (July 13, 2006). \n73.  Alabama’s history of voter discrimination is far from ancient. The state continues \nto implement a series of voting practices that have hindered the ability of African Americans to \nparticipate equally in the political process.  \n74.  Within the last five decades, African-American plaintiffs, the civil rights \ncommunity, and the federal government have sued Alabama on numerous occasions for racially \ndiscriminatory voting practices. See, e.g., Greater Birmingham Ministries et al. v. Alabama et \nal., 161 F. Supp. 3d 1104 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (photo identification law); Ala. Legislative Black \nCaucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015) (racial gerrymandering); S. Christian Leadership \nConference of Alabama v. Sessions, 56 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 1995) (at-large system for electing \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 20 of 30\ntrial judges); City of Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U.S. 462 (1987) (selective \nannexations); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985) (felon disenfranchisement); Harris v. \nGraddick (Harris I), 593 F. Supp. 128 (M.D. Ala. 1984) (appointment of disproportionately few \nblack poll officials); United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. 95 (M.D. Ala. 1966) \n(discriminatory administration of the poll tax); United States v. Logue, 344 F.2d 290 (5th Cir. \n1965) (racial discrimination in voter registration); Sims v. Baggett, 247 F. Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. \n1965) (racial gerrymandering); United States v. Atkins, 323 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1963) (racial \ndiscrimination in voter registration).  \n75.  The Department of Justice has sent observers to Alabama more than 91 times to \nensure that the right of African-American voters to participate in various elections was not \ndenied in the face of repeated attempts by white election officials to restrict African-American \naccess to the franchise. For instance, in 1992, the federal government sent observers to \nGreensboro, Alabama in Hale County after white election officials attempted to prevent African-\nAmerican voters from entering polling places following the election of the first African-\nAmerican officials to local office.  \n76.  In January 2014, a federal court in the Southern District of Alabama “bailed-in” \nthe City of Evergreen in Conecuh County for preclearance under Section 3(c) of the Voting \nRights Act—effectively making the county subject to preclearance under the Voting Rights Act \neven after the Shelby County v. Holder decision—because voter registrars and election officials \ncontinued to unconstitutionally discriminate against African-American voters. Allen v. City of \nEvergreen, Alabama, No. 13-0107-CG-M, 2014 WL 12607819 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 13, 2014). \n77.  In Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015), the \nSupreme Court remanded to the district court a case brought by African-American residents \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 21 of 30\nalleging that the Alabama legislative redistricting plans included racially gerrymandered districts \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. On remand, the three-\njudge panel ruled that twelve Alabama legislative districts were unconstitutional racial \ngerrymanders. Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1038 (M.D. \nAla. 2017). \n78.  Elected officials in Alabama continue to undermine voting opportunities in \nminority communities by enacting voter ID laws and resisting early voting and easier \nregistration. The day after the Shelby County decision, Alabama announced that it would move \nforward with the implementation of a strict photo ID law that had been passed by the Alabama \nlegislature in 2011. In other words, Alabama waited until it was no longer subject to preclearance \nreview under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to implement the law.  \n79.  Subsequently, the state closed 31 driver’s license offices, making it more difficult \nfor individuals to obtain the identification necessary to vote. The offices that were closed were \ndisproportionately located in poor, predominantly African-American communities. A federal \ninvestigation by the Department of Transportation found that “African Americans residing in the \nBlack Belt region of Alabama were disproportionately underserved by [the state’s] driver \nlicensing services, causing a disparate and adverse impact on the basis of race.” As a result, \nAlabama reopened many of the driver’s license offices but for fewer hours.  \n80.  In late 2015, a group of plaintiffs challenged the photo ID law on the grounds that \nit was enacted with a discriminatory purpose and would have a discriminatory effect in violation \nof Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs alleged that the Alabama legislature passed the photo ID law to make it \nmore burdensome for African Americans and other minorities to vote, and that the law would \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 22 of 30\nhave this intended effect because minorities disproportionately lacked the ID necessary to vote \nand lacked the necessary means (for example, transportation and time off from work) to obtain \nthe required ID. See Greater Birmingham Ministries, 161 F. Supp. 3d 1104. On February 17, \n2016, the district court denied Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. Id. The court later \ngranted motions to dismiss as to certain Defendants, and granted summary judgment for the \nSecretary of State on January 10, 2018. Greater Birmingham Ministries, 284 F.Supp.3d 1253. \nThe case is currently on appeal. \n81.  Alabama law disenfranchises individuals with certain felony convictions for \n“crimes of moral turpitude.” The list of convictions “involving moral turpitude” includes a \nnumber of non-violent crimes, including almost all theft crimes. Citizens with these \n“disqualifying” convictions may petition to have their rights restored, but only after paying all \ncourt-ordered fines, fees, and restitution. Describing this restriction as a modern-day poll tax, \nAlabama ex-felons have sued the state seeking removal of this economic barrier that limits their \nability to exercise their constitutional rights. See Thompson, et al. v. Alabama, 293 F.Supp.3d \n1313 (M.D. Ala. 2017). This law disenfranchises over 286,000 people in the state—7.6% of the \nentire statewide voting-age population, and 15.1% of the African-American male voting-age \npopulation. \n82.  Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill opposes automatic voter registration—a \nreform civil rights leaders have advocated for years—arguing that such a policy would “cheapen \nthe work” of voting rights activists, including John Lewis. In an interview, Merrill stated: “If \nyou’re too sorry or lazy to get up off of your rear to go register to vote, or to register \nelectronically, and then to go vote, then you don’t deserve that privilege. As long as I’m \nsecretary of state of Alabama, you’re going to have to show some initiative to become a \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 23 of 30\nregistered voter in this state.” \n83.  What is briefly described here as Alabama’s history and current reality of race \ndiscrimination in voting has been thoroughly documented by historians and scholars. The history \nis so extensive and well-established that several courts have taken judicial notice of it. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1346 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (“The intersection of \npolitical strategy and purposeful racial prejudice is nothing new. Alabama has a lengthy and \ninfamous history of racial discrimination in voting.”); Hunter, 471 U.S. at 229 (“[T]he Alabama \nConstitutional Convention of 1901 was part of a movement that swept the post-Reconstruction \nSouth to disenfranchise blacks . . . . The delegates to the all-white convention were not secretive \nabout their purpose.”); Dillard v. Crenshaw County, 640 F. Supp. at 1360 (“As the late Judge \nRichard T. Rives states, ‘from the Constitutional Convention of 1901 to the present, the State of \nAlabama has consistently devoted its official resources to maintaining white supremacy and a \nsegregated society.’”) (quoting United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. at 101).  \nUse of Racial Appeals in Political Campaigns \n84.  In addition to Alabama’s history of discrimination against minorities in voting \nand elections, political campaigns in Alabama have often relied on both explicit and implicit \nracial appeals.  \n85.  Former Alabama Governor George Wallace was explicit in his appeal to white \nvoters, running on a platform of “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” \n86.  More recently, the 2010 elections were marked by explicit and implicit racial \nappeals. For example, certain Alabama state senators were recorded on tape deliberately \nstrategizing about suppressing African-American voter turnout by keeping an issue important to \nAfrican Americans—whether to legalize electronic bingo—off the ballot. In these conversations, \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 24 of 30\nthen-State Senator Scott Beason, then-State Representative Benjamin Lewis (now an appointed \ncounty judge), and other influential members of the Alabama legislature are heard targeting \nAfrican-American voters for “mockery and racist abuse.”  McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1346. \nThey referred to African Americans as “Aborigines” and “Indians” and predicted that if the \nballot measure appeared on the ballot “every black in this state will be bused to the polls . . . \n[e]very black, every illiterate would be bused on HUD financed buses.” Id. at 1345 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  A federal district court found that the state senators’ efforts to \ndepress African-American voter turnout constituted an intentionally discriminatory “scheme” to \n“maintain and strengthen white control of the political system,” and that “political exclusion \nthrough racism remains a real and enduring problem in this State.” Id. at 1347.  \n87.  In November 2015 at a rally for then-candidate Donald Trump in Birmingham, a \npeaceful Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked by a group of men yelling, “Go \nhome nigger.” The next day, then-candidate Trump stated, “Maybe he should have been roughed \nup, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.”  The protestor had interrupted \nTrump’s speech to shout “Black Lives Matter!” \n88.  Roy Moore, candidate for U.S. Senate in the 2017 special election, stated at a \nrevival in Jackson, Alabama, “They started [to] create new rights in 1965, and today we’ve got a \nproblem,” an apparent reference to the Voting Rights Act. When asked to speak about the last \ntime America was great, Moore stated, “I think it was great at the time when families were \nunited—even though we had slavery—they cared for one another. . . . Our families were strong, \nour country had a direction.” \nOngoing Effects of Alabama’s History of Discrimination \n89.  African-American residents of Alabama bear the effects of the state’s history of \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 25 of 30\ndiscrimination in areas such as education, employment, income, and access to health care. In \nnearly every measure of every sphere of life, African Americans in Alabama lag behind whites. \nThese socio-economic disadvantages hinder African Americans’ ability to participate effectively \nin the political process. The effects of the history of de facto and de jure segregation in all realms \nof life—from transportation, to education, criminal justice, and business ownership—are still \nclearly visible in Alabama and continue to impact African Americans’ access to the franchise. As \nlate as the 1960s, Jim Crow was a grim reality in Alabama, as many African Americans attended \nseparate and unequal schools, lived in dilapidated and deteriorating housing, and toiled as \nunderpaid domestic and farm workers who were still completely shut out of the political process.  \n90.  In the present day, the disparities resulting from this state-sponsored \ndiscrimination remains. As of 2014, 43 school districts in Alabama were under some form of \nfederal oversight as a result of continued segregation, although the Supreme Court’s landmark \nBrown v. Board of Education decision was issued 60 years earlier. \n91.  African-American children still attend schools in racially segregated \nneighborhoods, and their families still disproportionately live in poverty. According to the 2012-\n2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, 30.1% of African Americans live \nbelow the poverty line, more than double the rate for white Alabamans. Similarly, 26.1% of \nAfrican-American family households live below the poverty line, more than double the rate for \nwhite family households.  \n92.  Despite African Americans’ ties to land and the agricultural industry in Alabama, \nthey still lag behind economically, in large part because they have had limited access to land \nownership historically. Following slavery, blacks worked as sharecroppers and labored under a \nhighly exploitative system of tenant farming that preserved much of the power relations of \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 26 of 30\nslavery. This history is reflected in the economic status of African Americans as compared to \nwhites in Alabama today. \n93.   According to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, \nthe median household income for white households is $51,684; the figure for African-American \nhouseholds is $30,180.  \n94.  African Americans in Alabama are unemployed at significantly higher rates than \nwhites. The 2012-2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates report that 7.5% of \nAfrican Americans over age 16 are unemployed as compared to only 3.7% of whites over age 16.  \n95.  African Americans are significantly more likely to rent their home and to not have \na vehicle available in their household as compared to whites.  \n96.  In 2010, the Alabama Department of Public Health reported that the infant \nmortality rate for African Americans was 14.1%, nearly double the rate for white Alabamans. \n97.  According to Alabama’s Prison Policy Initiative, under 2010 Census numbers, \nAfrican Americans represent only 26% of the total population but 54% of the total incarcerated \npopulation.  \nExtent to Which African Americans Have Been Elected to Public Office \n98.  African Americans are still woefully underrepresented in Alabama politics. \nDespite the fact that approximately 27% of Alabama’s population is African American, none of \nthe current statewide elected officials is African American. There has never been an African-\nAmerican governor or senator. White majorities and severe racial bloc voting continue to cement \nthese ongoing disparities.  \n99.  Because of white bloc voting against African-American candidates, only two \nAfrican Americans have been elected to statewide office in the history of Alabama. Every other \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 27 of 30\nblack statewide candidate has been defeated by a white candidate. The late Oscar Adams was \nappointed to a place on the Alabama Supreme Court in 1980; he won re-election in 1982 and \n1988. When Justice Adams retired in 1993, the governor appointed another African American, \nRalph Cook, to replace him. Justice Cook was re-elected in 1994.  \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nS.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n100.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n101.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the enforcement of any voting \nqualification or prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure that results in the \ndenial or abridgement of the right of any U.S. citizen to vote on account of race, color, or \nmembership in a language minority group. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).  \n102.  The current district boundaries of CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 combine to “crack” and \n“pack” African Americans, resulting in the dilution of the electoral strength of the state’s \nAfrican-American residents, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \n103.  African Americans in Alabama are sufficiently numerous and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority of eligible voters in two congressional districts. \n104.  Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the Alabama legislature was required \nto create a second majority-minority district in which African Americans have the opportunity to \nelect their candidates of choice.  \n105.  African-American voters in Alabama—and in particular in the Black Belt region \nand the surrounding area, as well as in the population centers in Mobile, Tuscaloosa, and \nJefferson counties—are politically cohesive, and elections in the state reveal a clear pattern of \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 28 of 30\nracially polarized voting that allows the bloc of white voters usually to defeat the African \nAmericans’ preferred candidates.  \n106.  The totality of the circumstances establishes that the current congressional map \nhas the effect of denying African-American voters an equal opportunity to participate in the \npolitical process and to elect candidates of their choice, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301.  \n107.  By engaging in the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendant has acted and \ncontinues to act to deny Plaintiffs rights guaranteed to them by Section 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct. Defendant will continue to violate those rights absent relief granted by this Court.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court:  \nA.  Declare that S.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \nB.  Order the adoption of a valid congressional redistricting plan that includes a \nsecond majority-minority district in Alabama.  \nC.  Issue a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, as well as his agents and \nsuccessors in office, from enforcing or giving any effect to the boundaries of the congressional \ndistricts as drawn in S.B. 484, including an injunction barring Defendant from conducting any \nfurther congressional elections under the current map.  \nD.  Hold hearings, consider briefing and evidence, and otherwise take actions \nnecessary to order a valid plan for new congressional districts in Alabama that comports with \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \nE.  Grant such other or further relief the Court deems appropriate, including but not \nlimited to an award of Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs.  \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-JEO   Document 1   Filed 06/13/18   Page 29 of 30\nDated:  June 13, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nBy: Richard P.

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \nLAKEISHA CHESTNUT, et al.,  ) \n  ) \n  Plaintiffs,  ) \n    ) \n  v.  )  Case No. 2:18-CV-00907-KOB \n    )   \nJOHN H. MERRILL,  ) \n    ) \n  Defendant.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \n  At the dawn of our nation, Alexander Hamilton adopted the words of the philosopher \nMontesquieu and wrote that “there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the \nlegislative and executive powers.”  The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton \nRossiter ed. 1961).  The founding fathers instituted the separation of powers, which lies at the \nvery foundation of American democracy, to protect liberty.  Occasionally, that careful separation \ncreates situations in which the court must abstain from delivering judgment, even where it might \nwish to interject, to respect the structure of our democratic government.  This is one such case.   \n  The Plaintiffs in this case raise issues under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  However, the \ncourt cannot reach the merits of those issues because it lacks the ability to grant the Plaintiffs \neffective relief under the facts of the case.  This inability to provide relief renders the case moot \nand, moreover, creates a situation in which any opinion issued by this court would be an advisory \nopinion addressed to the legislature in contravention of the separation of powers.  This court’s \npower of judging must remain separate from the legislative powers of creating new \ncongressional districts, so the court must dismiss this case as moot and jurisdictionally barred.   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 2 of 19\nI.  Background \n  Every ten years, the federal government conducts a census that provides the basis for \ncongressional districting.  See 2020 Census: What is the Census?, U.S. Census Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html (last visited \nMar. 13, 2019).  In 2011, the Alabama Legislature passed Alabama Act No. 2011-518 (S.B. \n484), now codified as Ala. Code § 17-14-70, which redrew Alabama’s congressional districts \nbased on numbers from the 2010 federal census.  See S.B. 484, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011).  \nS.B. 484 established seven congressional districts throughout Alabama, with one majority-\nminority district in District 7.   \n  The Plaintiffs in this case, ten African American voters residing in Alabama \nCongressional Districts 1, 2, 3, and 7, argue that Alabama’s congressional districts as established \nby S.B. 484 violate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, by “packing” and \n“cracking” African American voters between congressional districts to dilute African American \nvoting strength.  (Doc. 14).  The Plaintiffs allege that Alabama only has one majority-minority \ncongressional district—District 7—despite the fact that the African American population in \nAlabama is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to support a second majority-\nminority district.  Further, the Plaintiffs allege that § 2 of the VRA requires the creation of such a \ndistrict.   \n  The Plaintiffs argue that they can show evidence of a variety of factors indicating that, \nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, Alabama’s current congressional districting plan \nbased on the 2010 federal census violates § 2 of the VRA by impermissibly diluting African \nAmerican voting strength such that African Americans have less opportunity to elect \nrepresentatives of their choice than other members of the electorate.  In relief, the complaint \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 3 of 19\nrequests that this court (1) declare the current districting scheme unconstitutional; (2) order \nadoption of a valid congressional districting plan that includes a second majority-minority \ndistrict; (3) issue an injunction preventing Alabama from giving effect to the current district \nboundaries or conducting elections using those boundaries; (4) conduct any legal proceedings \nnecessary to order a new districting plan that comports with § 2; and (5) grant any other relief the \ncourt might deem appropriate.   \n  The Defendant, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, filed an answer admitting to \ncertain of the Plaintiffs’ factual allegations, but denying that Alabama’s constitutional districting \nplan violates § 2 of the VRA.  (Doc. 17).  Secretary Merrill then filed a motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings, arguing that jurisdiction lay with a three-judge panel, that the Plaintiffs had failed \nto establish a viable remedy, and that the Plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the doctrine of laches.  \n(Doc. 27).   \n  This court entered a memorandum opinion and order finding that the case did not require \na three-judge panel to establish jurisdiction because it was filed purely under § 2 of the VRA and \ndid not raise a constitutional challenge to the apportionment of congressional districts.  (Doc. \n40).  This court then entered a separate memorandum opinion addressing the remaining \narguments in Secretary Merrill’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  (Doc. 52).  The court \nfound that the Plaintiffs sufficiently pled the ability to create a second majority-minority \ncongressional district to defeat the assertion that they had not pled a viable remedy.  However, \nthe court found that, pursuant to the doctrine of laches, the delay by the Plaintiffs in bringing \ntheir suit barred any relief except for declaratory relief.  Thus, only declaratory relief remains \navailable to the Plaintiffs at this time.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 4 of 19\n  The parties did not file any additional dispositive motions.  The Defendant did not raise \nthe issue of mootness until pretrial conferences and pretrial briefing.  (Doc. 79 at 3; doc. 101 at \n17–22).   \n  The court held a bench trial in which the Plaintiffs and the Defendant offered expert and \nlay testimony regarding whether Alabama’s congressional districting complies with § 2 of the \nVRA.  As part of their case, the Plaintiffs presented expert testimony from Mr. William Cooper, \na redistricting and demographics expert, indicating that two majority-minority districts that \ncomplied with traditional districting principles could be created in central and south Alabama, \neach with slightly more than 50% black voting age population.  (Doc. 103 at 19).  To reach those \nnumbers, Mr. Cooper reconstituted all of the current congressional districts except for District 5 \nin varying ways that allowed him to connect African American population centers.   \n  Mr. Cooper testified that, in creating proposed redistricting plans, he relies primarily on \ndata produced by the Census Bureau after the decennial census.  (Doc. 103 at 15).  He went on to \nstate that his proposed illustrative districting plans were based on the numbers from the 2010 \ncensus, though he had also looked at some more recent population “estimates.”  (Id. at 15, 35).  \nMr. Cooper described his proposed congressional districting plans and explained why he \nbelieved that they complied with traditional redistricting principles.  Mr. Cooper stated that his \nplans all had two districts with more than 50% black voting age population, although the black \nvoting age population in each district was under 52%.  (Id. at 81–86).  The highest black voting \nage population in any of the majority-minority districts in Mr. Cooper’s proposed plans was \n51.95%, while the lowest was 50.33%.  (Id.).  Mr. Cooper also testified that he thought a \n“reasonable likelihood” exists that the African American population in Alabama would support \ntwo majority-minority districts even if Alabama went to a six-congressional-district plan after the \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 5 of 19\n2020 census.  (Id. at 22).  In addition to testifying about proposed congressional districts, Mr. \nCooper also testified about socioeconomic disparities between black and white voters.     \n  During Mr. Cooper’s direct examination, the Defendant argued that information about \npopulation growth after the 2010 census was not germane to the issues of Alabama’s 2011 \ndistricting plans.  (Doc. 103 at 38).  Over the Plaintiffs’ objection, the court agreed with the \nDefendant and found that information about the population in 2017 lacked relevance.  (Id. at 38).  \nThe court later agreed with the caveat that witnesses for the Defendant also could not present \ntestimony about evidence that was not related to the 2011 districting plan at issue in this case.  \n(Id. at 98).   \n  On cross-examination, Mr. Cooper testified that he did not believe that preserving the \ncores of existing congressional districts was a traditional districting criterion.  (Doc. 103 at 121).  \nRegarding the viability of his proposed congressional plans, Mr. Cooper testified that he had “no \nidea” if the Alabama Legislature could pass his proposed illustrative plans in 2020-2021 because \n“it’s all speculative” and a possibility exists that the plans would have to be adjusted based on \nnew census data.  (Id. at 136).  He also mentioned that he did not know if his proposed District 7 \nwould need to be expanded or not because it includes Tuscaloosa County, a “fast-growing” \ncounty.  (Id.)  On redirect, Mr. Cooper clarified that core retention of existing districts did not \nappear in the State Reapportionment Committee’s guide to redistricting.  (Id. at 137–38).    \n  The Plaintiffs then called multiple other expert and lay witnesses to testify regarding \nracially polarized voting in Alabama, the history of voter suppression in Alabama, communities \nof interest, and other relevant considerations necessary to assess the totality of the circumstances \nin this case.  The Plaintiffs rested their case and the Defendant presented multiple of his own \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 6 of 19\nexpert and lay witnesses seeking to show that Alabama’s current congressional districting \nscheme complies with § 2 of the VRA.      \n  As one of his witnesses, Secretary Merrill called retired Alabama Senator Gerald Dial, \nwho recently chaired the Alabama Legislature’s Reapportionment Committee.  Senator Dial \ntestified that the Alabama Legislature has consistently understood preservation of the cores of \nexisting congressional districts to be a traditional districting principle.  (Doc. 105 at 633–34).  A \nlater expert witness for the Defendant, Dr. Trey Hood, admitted that while the Alabama \nredistricting guidelines for the 2000 redistricting cycle mentioned core retention, the revised \n2011 guidelines do not explicitly reference retaining the cores of existing congressional districts.  \n(Doc. 107 at 916–18).  He also stated that, regardless, an interest in core preservation could not \ntrump compliance with § 2 of the VRA as a redistricting consideration.  (Id. at 918).  In answer \nto a question regarding whether Alabama appeared to care about core retention based on its \nprevious districting plans, Dr. Hood stated that “population has to be equalized across \nredistricting cycles.  That’s the chief goal always.”  (Doc. 107 at 951).   \nII.  Principles of Law \nSection 2 of the VRA renders unlawful any state “standard, practice, or procedure” that \n“results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on \naccount of race or color.”  52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).  A state’s procedures violate § 2 of the VRA \nwhere the totality of the circumstances shows that “the political processes leading to nomination \nor election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation” by \nminorities, and members of the minority “have less opportunity than other members of the \nelectorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.”  Id. § \n10301(b).  Dilution of minority voting strength through dispersal or concentration of minority \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 7 of 19\nvoters can constitute a violation of § 2.  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46–47 & n. 11 \n(1986).  In short, a state violates § 2 of the VRA if its districting plan provides less opportunity \nfor a racial minority to elect representatives of their choice than other members of the electorate.  \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 425 (2006).   \n  Section 2 of Article III of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal \ncourts to “cases” and “controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  From this limitation arises the \ndoctrine of justiciability, which recognizes the federal judiciary’s unelected status, “prevents \ncourts from encroaching on the powers of the elected branches of government[,] and guarantees \nthat courts consider only matters presented in an actual adversarial context.”  Al Najjar v. \nAshcroft, 273 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir. 2001).  “The doctrine of mootness derives directly from \nthe case-or-controversy limitation because ‘an action that is moot cannot be characterized as an \nactive case or controversy.’”  Id.  (quoting Adler v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 112 F.3d 1475, 1477 \n(11th Cir. 1997)).   \n  The Supreme Court has stated that “[i]t has long been settled that a federal court has no \nauthority ‘to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles \nor rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.’”  Church of \nScientology of California v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992) (quoting Mills v. Green, 159 \nU.S. 651, 653 (1895)).  Stated differently, a court has no jurisdiction over a moot case, so the \ncourt must consider any issues of mootness before proceeding to the merits of a case.  Al Najjar, \n273 F.3d at 1336.  A moot case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, even where “all briefs \nhave been filed, oral argument has been held, and nothing remains but the issuance of this \nCourt’s opinion,” or, as in this case, after testimony has been heard.  United States v. Koblan, \n478 F.3d 1324, 1325 (11th Cir. 2007).   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 8 of 19\n  A case becomes moot when the issues “are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest in the outcome.” Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969).  \nTherefore, a court must find a case moot where it “can no longer offer any effective relief to the \nclaimant.”  Gagliardi v. TJCV Land Tr., 889 F.3d 728, 733 (11th Cir. 2018).  Further, a \n“declaratory judgment devoid of ‘sufficient immediacy and reality’ cannot render a case \njusticiable.”  Id. at 735 (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402 (1975)).   \nIn other words, a case is moot where the relief requested would not have any “practical \neffect on the rights or obligations of the litigants.”  Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia v. \nCity of Sandy Springs, Georgia, 868 F.3d 1248, 1264 (11th Cir. 2017).  A decision on the merits \nof a moot case constitutes an “impermissible advisory opinion.”  Al Najjar, 273 F.3d at 1336.     \nIII.  Discussion \n  Before the court can address whether Alabama’s current legislative districting scheme \nviolates § 2 of the VRA, it must determine whether it has jurisdiction or whether it must dismiss \nthe case as moot.  See Al Najjar, 273 F.3d at 1336.  In his pretrial brief, Secretary Merrill argued \nfor the first time that this court’s decision denying injunctive relief based on the doctrine of \nlaches rendered this entire case moot because conditions will have changed when the state \nconducts new districting after the 2020 census.  (Doc. 101 at 18).  Secretary Merrill argued that \nthe congressional districting plan instituted after the upcoming census will necessarily reflect \npopulation shifts and perhaps even a change in the number of legislative districts, all of which \nwould render a declaratory judgment in this case based on the 2010 census advisory at best.  \nFurther, Secretary Merrill asserted that any argument about the effectiveness of declaratory relief \nas a benchmark for future legislative plans is rooted in preclearance under § 5 of the VRA, which \nno longer applies.         \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 9 of 19\n  The Plaintiffs’ pretrial brief did not address the issue of mootness.  (See generally doc. \n102).  However, after conducting the bench trial in this case, the court requested supplemental \nbriefing from the parties on the mootness issue.  (Doc. 109).  In their post-trial briefing, the \nPlaintiffs argue that a declaratory judgment in this case “can prevent future dilution of Plaintiffs’ \nvoting strength.”  (Doc. 112 at 1–2).  The Plaintiffs assert that the Defendant bears the burden of \nshowing mootness and cannot meet that burden in this case because a declaratory judgment \nwould significantly impact Alabama’s 2021 redistricting.  Because of limited evidence regarding \npopulation shifts offered at trial, Plaintiffs argue that the Defendant cannot meet the burden of \nshowing that population demographics in Alabama will be sufficiently different after the 2020 \ncensus to render this case moot.  They go on to assert, however, that the population of African \nAmericans in Alabama has increased since the 2010 census in a way that supports their position \nthat Alabama must have two majority-minority congressional districts.  Plaintiffs also argue that \neven without retrogression analysis under § 5 of the VRA, a declaratory judgment would have an \neffect on future districting because of Alabama’s focus on “core retention” in redistricting.   \n  In his response to the Plaintiffs’ mootness brief, Secretary Merrill argues that a \ndeclaratory judgment in this case would not obligate the Alabama Legislature to draw new \ndistricts in a particular manner in 2021, so a declaratory judgment has no practical effect on the \nparties.  (Doc. 115 at 7).  He elaborates that a declaratory judgment in this case would only have \nthe effects the Plaintiffs desire if the opinion were advisory in nature.   \n  The court finds that this case is indeed moot because this court’s decision on the \napplication of the doctrine of laches, combined with the impending 2020 census, prevents the \ncourt from being able to offer any meaningful relief to the Plaintiffs.  As an initial matter, the \ncourt addresses the issue of who bears the burden of showing mootness in this case.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 10 of 19\n  Citing World Wide Supply OU v. Quail Cruises Ship Mgmt, the Plaintiffs assert that \n“[t]he burden of establishing mootness rests with the party seeking dismissal.”  802 F.3d 1255, \n1259 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Beta Upsilon Chi Upsilon Ch. at the Univ. of Fla. v. Machen, 586 \nF.3d 908, 916 (11th Cir. 2009)).  However, research reveals that the issue is not so \nstraightforward.  As the Beta Upsilon case relied upon by the Court in World Wide Supply and an \nabundance of other cases from the Eleventh Circuit show, the burden of showing mootness \ntypically arises in cases involving mootness under the “voluntary cessation” doctrine, in which \nthe party seeking dismissal on mootness grounds must show that the ceased objectionable \nbehavior will not recur.  Beta Upsilon Chi Upsilon Ch. at the Univ. of Fla., 586 F.3d at 916; see \nalso, e.g., Socialist Workers Party v. Leahy, 145 F.3d 1240, 1247 (11th Cir. 1998) (discussing \nthe “heavy burden” of demonstrating mootness in cases involving voluntary cessation); United \nStates v. Askins & Miller Orthopaedics, P.A., 924 F.3d 1348, 1355 (11th Cir. 2019) (stating that \na party asserting mootness based on voluntary cessation bears a “heavy” and “formidable” \nburden).  In fact, even World Wide Supply dealt with the potential reoccurrence of behavior after \nan alleged lapse in in personam jurisdiction.  World Wide Supply OU, 802 F.3d at 1259 (stating \nthat “the fact that the property had left the district did not moot the appeal because the district \ncourt would again have personal jurisdiction over [the defendant] if the attachment were \nreinstated”).   \n  The fact that mootness is a jurisdictional issue further undercuts the Plaintiffs’ argument \nthat the Defendant bears the burden of showing mootness in this case.  See Al Najjar, 273 F.3d at \n1336.  The Eleventh Circuit has stated that, because mootness presents a threshold jurisdictional \nquestion, a court must consider mootness sua sponte even if the issue is not raised by the parties \nand must dismiss any case that “no longer presents a viable case or controversy.”  Brooks v. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 11 of 19\nGeorgia State Bd. of Elections, 59 F.3d 1114, 1118 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting Pacific Ins. Co. v. \nGeneral Development Corp., 28 F.3d 1093, 1096 (11th Cir. 1994)).  The instant case does not \ninvolve mootness because of a voluntary cessation of behavior by the Defendant, but, rather, \ninvolves developments that may deprive the action of a viable case or controversy.  Therefore, \nthe court would have been required to consider mootness even if the issue had not been raised or \nargued by either party.  See id.  Because of the court’s obligation to sua sponte determine \njurisdiction, the court must consider the facts on the record and assess whether jurisdiction lies \nwith this court, regardless of who bears the burden of proof.  But, even if the burden rests on the \nDefendant, the Defendant could make the requisite showing in this case.  \n  The facts in this case combine to show that the case no longer presents live issues in \nwhich the parties have a “legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  See Powell, 395 U.S. 496.  \nIn its decision regarding the application of the doctrine of laches, this court found that the delay \nby the Plaintiffs in bringing this case barred them from seeking any injunctive relief.  (Doc. 52 at \n14).  This court found, however, that the doctrine of laches did not bar declaratory relief because \nthe Defendant could not make the requisite showing of prejudice.  In finding that declaratory \nrelief was still available to the Plaintiffs, the court noted that “finding the current plan \nunconstitutional—if it is—would prevent the committee from reusing the plan as the basis for the \n2021 plan.”  (Id. at 14–15).   \n  Upon further consideration of the law and the parties’ arguments, the court finds it \nnecessary to expand upon that statement.  In stating that a declaratory judgment would prevent \nthe legislature from using the current congressional districting plan as a “basis” for the 2021 \nplan, the court relied on a holding from the Eleventh Circuit that specifically stated that \ndeclaratory relief in a similar situation could prevent the use of an unconstitutional plan “as a \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 12 of 19\nbaseline for retrogression analysis” under § 5 of the VRA.  Sanders v. Dooly Cty., GA, 245 F.3d \n1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2001).   \n  The Supreme Court came to the same conclusion in another similar case, Reno v. Bossier \nPar. Sch. Bd., in which it determined that an action for a declaratory judgment stating that a \nvoting scheme was unconstitutional was not moot because the unconstitutional plan had the \npotential to be used to evaluate retrogression to obtain preclearance of a subsequent voting \nscheme under § 5.  528 U.S. 320, 327–28 (2000).  In both of those cases, the Court emphasized \nthat the cases were not moot because the prior schemes, if not found to be unconstitutional, \nwould be used for retrogression analysis under § 5 of the VRA.   \n  But since the decisions in those cases, the legal landscape regarding § 5 preclearance has \nchanged. \n  Section 5 of the VRA prohibits covered jurisdictions from adopting any retrogressive \ndistricting change that has the purpose or effect of diminishing the ability of a minority group to \nelect their preferred candidates of choice.  52 U.S.C. § 10304(b).  Under § 5, no covered \njurisdiction can make a change in voting procedures without first obtaining “preclearance” from \nthe federal government by showing that the proposed districting plan did not result in \n“retrogression” that diminished a minority group’s proportionate strength such that the group no \nlonger maintained its ability to elect candidates of its choice.  Shelby Cty., Ala. v. Holder, 570 \nU.S. 529, 535, 549 (2013).  Thus, the retrogression analysis for § 5 preclearance requires the \ndirect comparison of a new proposed districting plan with the previous plan.  But, as the parties \nagreed in their proposed principles of law, the § 5 retrogression analysis and the need for a \n“benchmark” no longer apply after the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shelby County case.  See \nShelby Cty., Ala., 570 U.S. 529; (doc. 94 at 12).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 13 of 19\n  Because § 5 preclearance no longer applies in Alabama, the court’s previous statement \nabout a declaratory judgment preventing the use of the current plan as a basis for the 2021 \nredistricting—a statement relying on a case involving a retrogression baseline—carries little \npractical weight.  Without the strictures and procedures provided by § 5—which required \ncomparing a new districting plan to an old districting plan to avoid retrogression—no legally \nmandated reason exists to treat Alabama’s current congressional districting plan as a “baseline” \nor “basis” for the new districting plan that will go into effect after the 2020 census.  Further, a \nfinding in this case that a declaratory judgment would have a practical effect because of its use as \na baseline for a future plan would go beyond the current jurisprudence of both the Supreme \nCourt and the Eleventh Circuit, which places an emphasis on § 5 retrogression analysis as the \nreason that a declaratory judgment regarding a current voting scheme could still have a practical \neffect on the litigants. \n  The Plaintiffs attempt to sidestep this § 5 issue by arguing that if the court issues a \ndeclaratory judgment stating that the current congressional map “dilutes African American \nvoting strength in central and southern Alabama in violation of the Voting Rights Act, the state \nwill remedy that dilution when it redraws the congressional map following the 2020 census.”  \n(Doc. 112 at 3).  They argue that, if this court issues declaratory relief, the state will not be able \nto use the current map as a “starting point” for redrawing the new congressional districts.  \nHowever, without a requirement for a comparison of districting plans for retrogression purposes, \nthe tenuous connection between Alabama’s current districting plan and the upcoming 2021 plan \nsimply does not support such an extension of the higher Courts’ jurisprudence because of the \ndiffering factual circumstances that will necessarily underlie the 2011 and 2021 districting plans. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 14 of 19\n  The Plaintiffs argue that the record contains insufficient evidence of the differing \nconditions between the 2011 districting and the upcoming 2021 districting to show mootness.  It \nis true that, at trial, the court agreed with the Defendant’s motion to limit the admission of \nspecific evidence of post-2010 population shifts as irrelevant.  (Doc. 103 at 38).  Even so, the \nrecord reveals that the conditions underlying the current 2011 congressional districting plan are, \nat least when viewed within the framework of § 2 of the VRA, sufficiently different from the \ncircumstances of the upcoming 2021 districting plan to render this case moot. \n  Electoral districts expire every ten years because the federal government conducts a new \ncensus, which the state then uses to create an updated redistricting plan.  See 2020 Census: What \nis the Census?, U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-\ncensus/2020-census/about.html (last visited Mar. 13, 2019).  It does not take a census scholar to \nrecognize that the government conducts these periodic censuses and redistrictings because \npopulations and their distributions change.  See id.  The parties acknowledge these population \nchanges in their stipulated facts, stating that “Alabama’s population shifts between every census” \nand agreeing that Alabama’s African American population grew by around 5% between 2010 \nand 2017.  (Doc. 95 at ¶¶ 47, 51).   \nThese relatively abstract and limited changes in circumstances between redistrictings \nmight not be significant in a mootness analysis were it not for the extremely factually specific \nnature of § 2 vote dilution cases.  As the Eleventh Circuit noted, § 2 cases alleging vote dilution \nare “inherently fact-intensive.”  Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1498 (11th Cir. 1994).  The fact-\nintensive nature of § 2 inquiries springs in large part from the fact-based showing necessary to \nprove a violation of § 2; to show that a particular districting plan violates § 2 of the VRA, a \nplaintiff must show effective vote dilution by establishing three threshold requirements, or \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 15 of 19\n“preconditions,” originally set forth in Thornburg v. Gingles.  478 U.S. at 48–51.  One thing that \na plaintiff must show to succeed on a § 2 claim is a geographically compact minority population \nsufficient to constitute a majority in a single member congressional district.  Id.   \nThis showing required under the first Gingles precondition can be extremely delicate and \nnumerical in nature; the plaintiff must be able to show a minority voting age population of more \nthan 50% in a proposed election district that is sufficiently compact, meaning that it takes “into \naccount ‘traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and \ntraditional boundaries.’”  Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 18 (2009); Abrams v. Johnson, 521 \nU.S. 74, 91 (1997) (quoting Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 977 (1996) (plurality opinion)).   \nThe delicacy of the redistricting calculus shows in the facts of the instant case.  The \nPlaintiffs presented expert testimony asserting that they could make two reasonably compact \nmajority-minority congressional districts various ways, but all of the Plaintiffs’ proposed \ndistricting plans had two districts in which African-Americans exceeded 50% of the population \nof the proposed majority-minority districts by only razor-thin margins that were less than 2% and \noften less than 1%.  (Doc. 103 at 81–86).  Further, the parties argued strenuously about whether \nthe Plaintiffs’ proposed districts were sufficiently compact.      \n  The narrowness of the numerical margins in the proposed plans and the heatedness of the \ncompactness debate serves to emphasize that any change to the population makeup and \ndistribution in Alabama will fundamentally change the districting calculus.  The 2021 census will \nreveal new population statistics and there is simply no way to be at all confident that, especially \nin light of the bare majorities that the Plaintiffs were able to put forth for their proposed \nmajority-minority districts, the new statistics will allow for districting similar to the current \nlegislative districting plan or similar to the Plaintiffs’ proposed plans.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 16 of 19\n  Some of the Plaintiffs’ testimony even glancingly acknowledges this fact.  Mr. Cooper \ntestified about the “reasonable likelihood” that Alabama could sustain two majority-minority \ndistricts if, as he admitted was possible, Alabama went to a six-district congressional plan.  (Doc. \n103 at 22).  Mr. Cooper also admitted that Tuscaloosa County is “fast growing” and that his \nproposed districting plans were speculative and might have to be adjusted based on new census \ndata.  (Doc. 103 at 22, 136).  This testimony shows the lack of certainty regarding what will \nhappen with the upcoming census and emphasizes the fact that it will create a new factual \nbackground against which redistricting must be performed.   \n  In short, even if this court were to find that Alabama’s current congressional districting \nplan violates § 2 of the VRA, that finding would be based on such specific population numbers \nand distributions that the inevitable change brought by the upcoming census would render the \nfinding obsolete and of no import.   \n  The Plaintiffs attempt to assert the effectiveness of a declaratory judgment by arguing \nthat a finding that the current congressional districting plan violates § 2 would provide a basis for \nthe future redistricting plan because of the state’s interest in retaining the cores of existing \ncongressional districts.  This argument falls prey to the same issues discussed above.  Whether \nthe state can or cannot retain the cores of its current congressional districts while complying with \n§ 2 of the VRA will depend entirely on the population statistics shown by the 2020 census.     \n  As an initial matter, to what extent the Alabama Legislature considers core retention as a \nredistricting principle is not clear.  Mr. Cooper argued that core retention is not a traditional \nredistricting principle and the redistricting guidelines in Alabama do not explicitly mention core \nretention, but Senator Dial testified that the Alabama Legislature has consistently considered \ncore retention when redistricting.  (Doc. 103 at 121; doc. 107 at 916–918).  Even giving \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 17 of 19\nPlaintiffs the benefit of the doubt—or, more accurately, giving their current argument the benefit \nof the doubt, as they originally took the position that core retention is not a traditional districting \nprinciple—the issuance of a declaratory judgment in this case lacks sufficient practical effect to \navoid mootness.  \n  The 2021 congressional redistricting in Alabama will ultimately be determined by two \nthings: the new 2020 census data and the governing law.  Both the data and the law render any \ndeclaratory judgment by the court at the current juncture moot.  As discussed above, the specifics \nof the “fact-intensive” § 2 analysis will change with the arrival of the new census information.  \nSee Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1498.  As Dr. Hood testified, population equalization across redistricting \ncycles is “the chief goal” in redistricting after a new census, and that will depend entirely on the \ncensus data.  (Doc. 107 at 951).   \n  Another piece of Dr. Hood’s testimony provides further context: an interest in core \nretention cannot trump compliance with the VRA.  (Id. at 918).  Regardless of Alabama’s current \ncongressional districting plan or any decision by this court in this case, § 2 of the VRA binds the \nAlabama Legislature and the 2021 redistricting process.  See Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, \n2315 (2018) (noting that a state is “required to comply” with § 2 of the VRA).  Further, the \nPlaintiffs admit that “the state’s redistricting guidelines have consistently required that any \ncongressional plan adhere to the Voting Rights Act.”  (Doc. 112 at 3).  Therefore, all of the \nPlaintiffs’ arguments about a declaratory judgment in this case remedying future vote dilution \nunder § 2 merely ask the court to reiterate an obligation already incumbent upon the Alabama \nLegislature.  Because this request for relief effectively duplicates a standing obligation \nestablished by Congress, a declaratory judgment in this case would have no “practical effect” on \nthe rights or obligations of the parties and the case is moot.  See Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. of \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 18 of 19\nGeorgia, 868 F.3d at 1264.  The court finds the requested relief similar to an “obey-the-law \ninjunction,” and, thus, finds it similarly not to be countenanced.  Hughey v. JMS Dev. Corp., 78 \nF.3d 1523, 1531 (11th Cir. 1996) (stating that “appellate courts will not countenance injunctions \nthat merely require someone to ‘obey the law’”). \nFurther, the 2021 redistricting completed after the 2020 census will be subject to a new \n§ 2 challenge in which a court can effectively evaluate the specifics of the new districting plan \nand assess compliance with § 2.  Moreover, such a case could be brought without the delay that \nforeclosed injunctive relief in this case.  Accordingly, this case does not fall into the exception to \nmootness for cases “capable of being repeated and evading review.”  Al Najjar, 273 F.3d at \n1336.  Even if the same § 2 controversy were to occur upon redistricting and involve the same \nparties, the Plaintiffs would have more than adequate time to fully litigate the issue with the \nbenefit of the specifically applicable factual background.     \n  At this stage of the current congressional districting in which a new districting cycle \nlooms on the horizon and the Plaintiffs have only the hope of declaratory relief as to the current \ndistricting scheme, this case fails to present a live controversy.  See Powell, 395 U.S. at 496.  The \nparties have no cognizable interest in the outcome of the case because—based on the \nunavailability of injunctive relief, the inevitable change in census numbers, and the binding \nnature of § 2 of the VRA—the court cannot offer effective relief, as a declaratory judgment will \nhave no immediacy or reality.  See Gagliardi, 889 F.3d at 733.  To the extent that the Plaintiffs \nwish this court, without knowledge of what the upcoming census will bring or the ability to take \naction, to simply inform the Alabama Legislature that it should create two majority-minority \ndistricts when it next conducts redistricting, such an opinion would be impermissibly advisory.  \nSee Al Najjar, 273 F.3d at 1336.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 121   Filed 03/17/20   Page 19 of 19\nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  This court chooses to heed Mr. Hamilton’s exhortation from long ago urging the \nsafeguarding of liberty through the separation of the powers of judgment and legislation.  The \npower to draw new congressional districts belongs to the Alabama Legislature.  The courts can \nanalyze the legality of the Alabama Legislature’s choices and even perhaps remedy them when \nthose choices culminate in specific controversies that allow the courts to appropriately grant \nrelief.  This case does not present such a controversy.  Accordingly, the court finds this case \nMOOT and DISMISSES IT WITHOUT PREJUDICE for lack of jurisdiction.      \nDONE and ORDERED this 17th day of March, 2020.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nKARON OWEN BOWDRE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n19 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs brought the instant suit under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act to \nchallenge the Alabama congressional map on the ground that it illegally dilutes \nAfrican-American voting power. After Defendant filed an initial motion to dismiss, \nDoc. 11, along with a “Notice of Jurisdictional Issue” regarding this Court’s ability \nto hear the case, Doc. 12, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, Doc. 14, which \nthis Court ruled mooted Defendant’s motion, Doc. 16. Defendant subsequently \nanswered  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint.  Doc.  17.  Nearly  three  months  later, \nDefendant filed the present motion seeking dismissal of the suit on a myriad of \nbaseless grounds, all of which should be rejected. Defendant’s contention—for the \nsecond time—that this claim is improperly before a single district judge ignores the \nplain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284, which limits the jurisdiction of three-judge \npanels to constitutional claims, not vote dilution claims brought under the VRA. \nDefendant’s  challenge  to  the  sufficiency  of  Plaintiffs’  allegations,  moreover, \nimposes a higher pleading burden than permitted by Rule 8 and ignores numerous \nfactual  allegations  in  the  Amended  Complaint  that  support  Plaintiffs’  claims.  \nFinally, laches does not apply to bar Plaintiffs’ claim, which seeks prospective relief \nfor future elections, and even if it did, Defendant falls far short of his burden to \nestablish this affirmative defense. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below as \nwell as in Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 15, which \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 4 of 35\nis incorporated fully herein, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny \nDefendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  Judgment on the pleadings is only appropriate where there are no material \nfacts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See \nOrtega v. Christian, 85 F.3d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir. 1996). A motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings under Rule 12(c) is governed by the same standards as a motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Ala. Teachers Credit Union v. Design Build Concepts, \nInc., No. 4:16-CV-2027-KOB, 2017 WL 1331019, at *1 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 11, 2017). \nIn determining whether a party is entitled to judgment on the pleadings, the court \nmust accept as true all material facts alleged in the non-moving party’s pleading and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. Raines v. Caldwell, No. 2:17-CV-\n00974-RDP-JEO, 2018 WL 3368962, at *1 (N.D. Ala. July 10, 2018) (quoting Perez \nv. Wells Fargo N.A., 774 F.3d 1329, 1335 (11th Cir. 2014)). “The complaint may \nnot be dismissed ‘unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set \nof facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.’” Hawthorne v. \nMac Adjustment, Inc., 140 F.3d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Slagle v. ITT \nHartford, 102 F.3d 494, 497 (11th Cir. 1996)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 5 of 35\nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Case is Properly Before a Single District Judge \n  Defendant’s assertion that 28 U.S.C. § 2284 mandates the convening of a \nthree-judge panel in this case is, just as it was the first time Defendant raised the issue \nin his Notice of Jurisdictional Issue, wholly without merit. Defendant asserts that he \nhas been newly inspired on this point by Senator McClendon’s proposed motion to \ndismiss and the State of Louisiana’s (pending) motion to dismiss in Johnson v. \nArdoin,  No.  3:18-cv-00625  (M.D.  La.).  Mot.  at  1  n.1.1  Defendant  fails  to \nacknowledge,  however,  that,  in  a  similar  §  2  case  challenging  a  statewide \ncongressional plan, the State of Georgia has agreed that the case “is properly before \na  single  district  judge”  and  that  “there  is  no  question  regarding  th[e]  Court’s \njurisdiction.” Joint Statement Regarding Assignment of Three-Judge Panel, Dwight \nv. Kemp, No. 1:18-cv-2869-RWS (N.D. Ga. Sept. 12, 2018), ECF No. 25 at 1-2; see \nalso id. at 5 (“Because the § 2 claim at issue here is functionally and substantively \ndistinct from the constitutional claims referenced in 28 U.S.C. § 2284, the parties \nsubmit that a three-judge court is not appropriate in this case.”). The court in that case \nhas since issued a scheduling order to allow the case to proceed before a single district \njudge. Dwight v. Kemp, ECF No. 27; see Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 402 F.3d \n                                                           \n1 Senator McClendon’s proposed Motion to Dismiss is not before this Court as Senator \nMcClendon was denied intervention. Doc. No. 24. Counsel for Senator McClendon has since \nappeared on behalf of the State. Doc. 26. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 6 of 35\n1267, 1280 (11th Cir. 2005) (citing Rembert v. Apfel, 213 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir. \n2000)) (courts must always consider the question of whether they have subject matter \njurisdiction, even if no party has raised it).  \n  Defendant’s argument on this score is no more persuasive now than it was \nwhen he raised it four months ago. It ignores not only the statute’s plain language but \nalso standard principles of statutory interpretation and constitutional avoidance, as \nwell  as  long-standing  jurisprudence  mandating  strict  statutory  construction  for \nstatutes permitting three-judge courts.  \n  The plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a) provides that “[a] district court of \nthree judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when \nan  action  is  filed  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  the  apportionment  of \ncongressional  districts  or  the  apportionment  of  any  statewide  legislative  body” \n(emphasis added). The text of the statute leaves no room for ambiguity: three-judge \ncourts are convened only where plaintiffs raise constitutional claims. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enters, Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989) (“The task of resolving the \ndispute over the meaning of [the statute] begins where all such inquiries must begin: \nwith the language of the statute itself. In this case it is also where the inquiry should \nend, for where, as here, the statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts \nis to enforce it according to its terms.”) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint alleges a violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act⸺a statutory, not a \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 7 of 35\nconstitutional claim. Doc. 14 (“Am. Compl.”) ⁋⁋ 102-109. Thus, not only should this \ncase not be referred to a three-judge court, the plain language of the statute dictates \nthat it cannot be. Defendant’s insistence that the Court ignore the plain language of \nthe statute has not become more persuasive upon repetition.   \n  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has “long held that congressional \nenactments  providing  for  the  convening  of  three-judge  courts  must  be  strictly \nconstrued.” Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 561–62 (1969) (citing \nPhillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246 (1941)); see also, e.g., Morales v. Turman, \n430 U.S. 322, 324 (1977) (“The ruling [] merely reflected the consistent recognition \nthat the three-judge court procedure is not a measure of broad social policy to be \nconstrued with great liberality, but . . . an enactment technical in the strict sense of \nthe term and to be applied as such.” (quotation marks omitted)). This is because \n“[c]onvening a three-judge court places a burden on our federal court system, and \nmay often result in a delay in a matter needing swift initial adjudication.” Allen, 393 \nU.S. at 561. Consistent with this principle of strict construction, courts have dissolved \nthree-judge panels in § 2 cases that, like this one, did not assert any constitutional \nclaims in challenging statewide redistricting plans. See, e.g., Rural W. Tenn. African-\nAm. Affairs Council, Inc. v. Sundquist, 209 F. 3d 835, 838 (6th Cir. 2000) (noting that \na three-judge panel, which convened after plaintiffs asserted a § 2 and a constitutional \nclaim, disbanded itself after plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint solely under \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 8 of 35\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act). Thus, not only is a referral for a three-judge panel \nunwarranted here, this Court is not at liberty to expand the scope of 28 U.S.C. § 2284 \nto include the § 2 statutory claim as any panel would lack jurisdiction to resolve it. \n  Defendant’s effort to suggest that Plaintiffs’ § 2 claim should be considered “a \nform of constitutional challenge,” Mot. at 3, is similarly misguided. As an initial \nmatter, Defendant provides no support for the proposition that the Court can read a \nconstitutional claim into a plaintiff’s complaint where none has been alleged. On the \ncontrary, it is a well-settled rule that “the plaintiff [is] the master of the claim,” and \n“‘[j]urisdiction may not be sustained on a theory that the plaintiff has not advanced.’” \nBeneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 12 (2003) (quoting Merrell Dow \nPharms. Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 809, n.6 (1986)). In fact, this rule is so \ndeeply rooted that even if Plaintiffs in this case were engaging in artful pleading “to \navoid a three-judge court,” Mot. at 2, (which they are not), such action would be \nentirely permissible, as the rule specifically recognizes that a plaintiff may draft his \nclaims to avoid an exercise of jurisdiction. Id. (explaining that the well-pleaded \ncomplaint rule allows plaintiffs to “avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance \non state law”); see also The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 25 \n(1913) (“Of course, the party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will \nrely upon.”).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 9 of 35\n  Moreover, Defendant’s reliance on the City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 \n(1980), a case that pre-dated the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, to \ncontend that § 2 and the Fifteenth Amendment are “in essence” identical, Mot. at 4, \nignores the critical distinction between the two: \nThe  Senate  Report  which  accompanied  the  1982  amendments \nelaborates on the nature of § 2 violations and on the proof required \nto  establish  these  violations.  First  and  foremost,  the  Report \ndispositively rejects the position of the plurality in Mobile v. Bolden, \n. . . which required proof that the contested electoral practice or \nmechanism was adopted or maintained with the intent to discriminate \nagainst minority voters. See, e.g., S.Rep., at 2, 15–16, 27. The intent \ntest was repudiated for three principal reasons—it is “unnecessarily \ndivisive  because  it  involves  charges  of  racism  on  the  part  of \nindividual officials or entire communities,” it places an “inordinately \ndifficult”  burden  of  proof  on  plaintiffs,  and  it  “asks  the  wrong \nquestion.” Id., at 36, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1982, p. 214. \nThe  “right”  question,  as  the  Report  emphasizes  repeatedly,  is \nwhether “as a result of the challenged practice or structure plaintiffs \ndo  not  have  an  equal  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  political \nprocesses and to elect candidates of their choice.” Id., at 28, U.S. \nCode Cong. & Admin. News 1982, p. 206.  \n \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 43–44 (1986) (citation omitted). Defendant, \ntherefore, is plain wrong to assert that “there is no practical difference in the way this \nclaim will be litigated[] or decided” under § 2 than it would had it been brought under \nthe  Fourteenth  or  Fifteenth  Amendments.  Mot.  at  4.  As  explained  at  length  in \nPlaintiffs’ opposition to Defendant’s motion to dismiss, vote dilution claims and \nconstitutional claims are analytically and practically distinct. See Miller v. Johnson, \n515 U.S. 900, 911 (1995) (a claim of racial gerrymandering is “analytically distinct” \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 10 of 35\nfrom a vote dilution claim); see also Bethune-Hill v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 141 \nF.Supp.3d 505, 512 (E.D. Va. 2015) (same), aff’d in part and vacated in part,137 S. \nCt. 788 (2017); Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1227, \n1290 (M.D. Ala. 2013) (same); LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 432-33 (2006) \n(district  court’s  analysis  of  compactness  “for  equal  protection  purposes”  is \n“inapposite” “[u]nder § 2,” which “embraces different considerations”). These claims \nrequire proof of different elements, call for different remedies, are adjudicated under \ndifferent legal standards, and address different legal harms. See Pls.’ Opp. to Mot. to \nDismiss, Doc. 15, pg. 1, 3-4. “The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral \nlaw, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an \ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their \npreferred representatives.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47. Notably, § 2 does not require \nproof of intentional discrimination or race-based motive (or any intent at all); rather, \n“[u]nlike discrimination claims brought pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, \nCongress has clarified that violations of Section 2(a) can ‘be proved by showing \ndiscriminatory effect alone.’” Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 243 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 612 (2017). Construing \nPlaintiffs’  §  2  claim  as  an  intentional  discrimination  claim  under  the  Fifteenth \nAmendment or a racial gerrymandering claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, \ntherefore, would essentially force Plaintiffs to satisfy an “‘inordinately difficult’ \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 11 of 35\nburden of proof,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 43-44; see also Miller, 515 U.S. at 928 \n(O’Connor,  J.,  concurring)  (racial  gerrymandering  plaintiffs  must  satisfy  a \n“demanding” standard to establish racial motivation), in support of a claim they are \nnot  even  making.  Defendant  cannot  strongarm  Plaintiffs  into  asserting  a \nconstitutional claim.  \n  Defendant’s continued reliance on Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. \n2001), moreover, fails to provide support for his novel theory that § 2 claims are the \nequivalent of constitutional claims for jurisdictional purposes. Defendant begins his \ndiscussion of Page by mischaracterizing its holding. See Mot. at 4 (“[T]he Third \nCircuit held that 28 U.S.C. § 2284 should be construed to reach claims brought under \nthe Voting Rights Act.”). Three pages later, Defendant admits that Page in fact held \nonly that “a three-judge court should decide Section 2 claims that are brought in \nconjunction with constitutional claims,” and accordingly Page “is not directly on \npoint.” Mot. at 6 (emphasis added). That is an understatement. Plaintiffs have already \nexplained at length the multiple reasons Page is entirely uninformative here, where \nPlaintiffs have asserted only a statutory claim. See Pls. Op. to Mot. to Dismiss, Doc. \n15, pg. 6-8. By referring to a three-judge panel the “action” before it “challenging the \nconstitutionality” of a statewide redistricting plan, the Page ruling falls squarely \nwithin the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). See also Rural W. Tenn. African \nAm.  Affairs  Council,  Inc,  209  F.  3d  at  838  (disbanding  a  three-judge  panel  in \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 12 of 35\nchallenge to reapportionment of state House districts after plaintiffs filed a second \namended complaint dropping their constitutional claim and advancing solely a claim \nunder § 2 of the Voting Rights Act). The Page holding thus has no bearing on this \ncase.  \n  Defendant again contends that when 28 U.S.C. § 2284 was narrowed in 1976 \nto  require  that  three-judge  courts  hear  challenges  to  the  “constitutionality”  of \napportionment plans, there was no cause of action for apportionment plans under § \n2 because the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act had not yet been passed. \nBut even if apportionment plans were not commonly challenged under § 2 until after \nthe 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, Congress has had more than three \ndecades to amend either § 2 or 28 U.S.C. § 2284 to mandate that § 2 claims (or more \ngenerally, Voting Rights Act claims) be decided by a three-judge court. It has not \ndone so. Indeed, in Allen v. State Board of Elections, the Court found that the three-\njudge court statute applies to claims brought under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act \nspecifically because “[t]he final sentence of s 5 provides that ‘(a)ny action under this \nsection shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges.’” Allen, 393 U.S. \nat 561 (citing 42 U.S.C. s 1973c (1964 ed., Supp. I)). The Court further noted that, \nwith respect to the Voting Rights Act, where Congress wanted to, it expressly \nallowed for three-judge courts in other sections. See id. at 563 (discussing similar \nlanguage in §10 of the Voting Rights Act). No such language, however, exists in § \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 13 of 35\n2. Had it been Congress’s intent for three-judge courts to hear § 2 cases, Allen \ndemonstrates that Congress certainly knew how to expressly provide as much either \nin the text of § 2 or in 28 U.S.C. § 2284.2  \n  Finally, Defendant requests an immediate certification of interlocutory appeal \nof this issue under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Certification under § 1292(b) “is by a wide \nmargin the exception, not the rule.” Drummond Co., Inc. v. Collingsworth, No. 2:15-\ncv-506-RDP, 2017 WL 4783549, at *2 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 14, 2017); see also McFarlin \nv. Conseco Servs., LLC, 381 F.3d 1251, 1264 (11th Cir. 2004); OFS Fitel, LLC v. \nEpstein, Becker, and Green, P.C., 549 F.3d 1344, 1359 (11th Cir. 2008). Defendant \nasserts that the question of whether a three-judge panel is required meets the five-part \ntest for certification of interlocutory appeal under McFarlin, 381 F.3d at 1264. Mot. \nat 8-9. But although Defendant bears the burden of demonstrating these grounds, he \nhas made no argument whatsoever to establish any of them. See McFarlin, 381 F.3d \nat 1264 (holding that the petitioning party failed to carry its burden of persuading the \n                                                           \n2 Cavanagh v. Brock, 577 F. Supp. 176 (E.D.N.C. 1983), does not apply to this case. The plaintiffs \nin Cavanagh did not allege any statutory violation; they alleged that the map violated the North \nCarolina Constitution. Because 28 U.S.C. § 2284 requires the convening of a three-judge court \nonly for federal constitutional challenges, the three-judge statute did not apply. 577 F. Supp. at \n180 n.3. The fact that Defendant raised a defense under the VRA was not sufficient to mandate a \nthree-judge court under 28 U.S.C. § 2284 either. Id. (finding a “substantial likelihood that this \nmatter is beyond the purview of § 2284”). When the Cavanagh case was removed to federal court, \nit  was  consolidated  with  two  other  pending  redistricting  cases  that  were  designated  for \ndetermination by a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284. Id. at 179. Because a three-\njudge court was not mandated by 28 U.S.C. § 2284 in Cavanagh, the Court essentially dismantled \nthe three-judge panel that had been previously designated by designating the circuit judge to sit as \na district judge. Id. at 180 n.3. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 14 of 35\ncourt that a question of law meeting the requirements of § 1292(b) was clearly \npresented). This omission is fatal to Defendant’s request.  \n  Indeed, it is plain there are no grounds for certification here. To determine if a \n“substantial ground for difference of opinion” exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), \ncourts must examine to what extent the controlling law is unclear. “[A] court faced \nwith  a  motion  for  certification  must  analyze  the  strength  of  the  arguments  in \nopposition to the challenged ruling to decide whether the issue is truly one on which \nthere is a substantial ground for dispute.” Williams v. Saxon Mortg. Co., Civ. Act. \nNo. 06-0799-WS-B, 2007 WL 4105126, at *2 (S.D. Ala. Nov. 15, 2007). Courts have \nrejected a finding of a substantial ground for difference of opinion in a multitude of \nscenarios, including where there is a mere absence of binding authority on the issue, \nsee id.; where there is a disputed issue that is a question of first impression, see In re \nFlor, 79 F.3d 281, 284 (2nd Cir. 1996); and, most applicable here, where the statutory \nlanguage is clear, see Singh v. Daimler-Benz, AG, 800 F. Supp. 260, 263 (E.D. Pa. \n1992), aff’d, 9 F.3d 303 (3d Cir. 1993). Here, there is simply no ground supporting a \npurported difference of opinion, much less a substantial one. As demonstrated, there \ncan be no genuine dispute as to the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2284. Indeed, Defendant \nhas not identified a single case in which a three-judge court considered an action in \nwhich Plaintiffs brought only a § 2 claim. Undoubtedly, the reason why this issue has \nnot come up before is because the language of the statute is clear: § 2 claims are \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 15 of 35\nstatutory, and thus 28 U.S.C. § 2284 does not apply. This question should not be \ncertified for appeal.  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint Sufficiently Alleges that African-\nAmerican Voters in Alabama Meet the First Gingles Requirement \n \n  Defendant’s  argument  that  Plaintiffs  fail  to  sufficiently  allege  (and  lack \nstanding to allege) the first Gingles precondition (i.e., that African-American voters \ncan  constitute  a  reasonably  compact  majority  in  two  congressional  districts) \nimproperly seeks to impose upon § 2 plaintiffs a heightened standard of pleading than \nrequired by the Federal Rules or legal precedent. Read as a whole and with a proper \nunderstanding  of  the  law,  Plaintiffs’  Amended  Complaint  provides  more  than \nsufficient facts to demonstrate that the African-American population in Alabama is \nsufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority of eligible \nvoters in two congressional districts.  \n  Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to the first Gingles \nprecondition amount to nothing more than “naked assertion[s] devoid of further \nfactual enhancement,” Mot. at 12, pointing only to paragraphs 6 and 105 (in the \nintroduction and cause of action) of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, Mot. at 11, 12, \n13.  In  so  doing,  he  overlooks  the  actual  allegations  set  forth  in  the  Amended \nComplaint. For example, the Amended Complaint sets forth the substantial Black \nVoting Age Population residing in CD 7, Am. Compl. ⁋ 38, and alleges that the \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 16 of 35\ncurrent redistricting plan “‘packs’ African-American voters into CD 7 and ‘cracks’ \nAfrican-American voters among three other congressional districts—CDs 1, 2, and \n3—despite the fact that African-American population in these areas could have been \nunited to form an additional majority-minority congressional district. Id. ⁋⁋ 3, 31. \nAs specific evidence of “cracking,” the Amended Complaint points to CDs 1, 2, and \n3, which each contain at least one heavily African-American area in an otherwise \nmajority-white district. Id. ⁋ 43 (CD 3 contains Macon County, which has an African-\nAmerican population of 82.6%, CD 1 includes Mobile County (34.6% African-\nAmerican population) and Monroe County (41.7% African American population, \nwhile Montgomery County, with an African-American population of 54.7%, is split \nbetween CDs 2, 3, and 7); see also id. ⁋ 45 (“[T]he Black Belt and the surrounding \narea is split among four congressional districts -- CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7.”). The Amended \nComplaint specifies that “[b]y unpacking CD 7’s African-American population and \ncombining it with African-American population in other districts such as CDs 1, 2, \nand 3, the Alabama legislature could have drawn two majority-minority districts in \nS.B. 484.” Id. ⁋ 42.  \n  The Amended Complaint also alleges that several of the plaintiffs reside in \nareas that could be drawn into an additional majority-minority congressional district. \nId. at ⁋⁋13 (Mobile County), 14 and 18 (Montgomery County), 19 (Bullock County), \n20 (Lee County), 21 (Macon County), 22 (Clarke County). Taken together, these \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 17 of 35\nfacts are more than sufficient to infer that African Americans residing in a relatively \ncompact area are sufficiently numerous to form a second majority-minority district.  \n  Ultimately, Defendant asks for far more than plausible allegations, insisting \ninstead on a copy of the proposed map (or, alternatively a comprehensive list of \ncensus blocks that would comprise the new district) Plaintiffs will eventually provide \nin an expert report to prove their claim. See Mot. at 13 (arguing Plaintiffs were \n“required  to  include  in  [their]  pleading  a  map  showing  that  the  district  [they] \npropose[] could, as a matter of fact, have been drawn by Alabama”). This is simply \nnot required. The cases Defendant relies on for this do not evaluate the requirements \nfor pleading a § 2 claim, but rather discuss the requirements for proving a § 2 claim—\nafter a trial or hearing on the merits and a complete evidentiary record. See Johnson \nv. DeSoto Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 204 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2000) (evaluating \nsufficiency of plaintiffs’ showing after trial on the merits); Burton v. City of Belle \nGlade, 178 F.3d 1175, 1199 (11th Cir. 1999) (addressing the proof requirement at \nthe summary judgment stage); Brooks v. Miller, 158 F.3d 1230, 1233 (11th Cir. 1998) \n(district  court  considered  evidence  presented  at  five-day  hearing  on  motion  for \npreliminary  injunction  and  four-day  bench  trial  as  well  as  exhibits  and  reports \nsubmitted by the parties); Davis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998) \n(evaluating plaintiffs’ claim after a bench trial); S. Christian Leadership Conference \nof Ala. v. Sessions, 56 F.3d 1281, 1289, 1294–97 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc) (district \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 18 of 35\ncourt rejected plaintiffs’ claims after bench trial); Wright v. Sumter Cty. Bd. of \nElections and Registration, No. 1:14-cv-42 (WLS) 2014 WL 1347427, at *3 (M.D. \nGa.  Apr.  3,  2014)  (denying  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  after  evidentiary \nhearing).3 To hold that an illustrative plan is required to sufficiently plead the first \nGingles precondition would necessarily conflate the pleading standard for § 2 with \nan evidentiary standard. This is out of line with both the liberal pleading standards of \nRule 8, the case law on Article III standing, see Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992) (no substantive evidence required at pleading stage for plaintiffs to \ndemonstrate standing, “for on a motion to dismiss [the court] ‘presum[es] that general \nallegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim’”) \n(citation omitted), and the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Voting Rights Act, \nsee, e.g., Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. at 380, 403–04 (1991) (“The VRA should be \ninterpreted in a manner that provides the broadest possible scope in combating racial \ndiscrimination.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). \n  Defendant cites only one district court case that demanded an illustrative map \nat the pleading stage—Broward Citizens for Fair Dists. v. Broward Cty., No. 12-\n60317-CIV, 2012 WL 1110053 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 2012)—and it is an outlier. To \n                                                           \n3 Defendant complains that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case. Mot. at 9. But \nPlaintiffs do not have the burden of establishing a prima facie case at the pleading stage. See Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 569-70 (2007) (explaining that prima facie is a “heightened \npleading requirement,” inappropriate at the pleading stage, which requires “only enough facts to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face”). \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 19 of 35\nPlaintiffs’ knowledge, no other court has required an illustrative map at the pleading \nstage or cited Broward for this proposition. In fact, one court specifically rejected the \nBroward holding, finding that “requiring the submission of a proposed map with the \ncomplaint [extends] what is an evidentiary requirement for purposes of summary \njudgment to the pleading stage of litigation.” Luna v. Cty. of Kern, No. 1:16-cv-\n00568-DAD-JLT, 2016 WL 4679723, at *5 (E.D. Ca. Sept. 2, 2016); see also Metts \nv. Murphy, 363 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2004) (“It is no accident that most cases under \nsection 2 have been decided on summary judgment or after a verdict, and not on a \nmotion to dismiss.”). The court explained that such a requirement would necessarily \nforce factual disputes and require expert analysis, effectively requiring plaintiffs “to \ndevelop an unobjectionable map, before discovery even begins.” Luna, 2016 WL \n4679723, at *5.4 Neither the letter nor the spirit of Rule 8 requires as much. \n  Defendant once again asserts without argument that “this issue also meets \nMcFarlin’s five requirements for interlocutory appeal.” Mot. at 15. On the contrary, \nDefendant’s argument on this question rests entirely on a single, discredited district \ncourt  case  and  defies  the  well-established  pleading  standard  under  Rule  8. \n                                                           \n4 In addition, the Luna court noted that the Eleventh Circuit case relied on in Broward for the \nproposition that a map is required at the pleading stage, Burton, 178 F.3d at 1199, was not, in fact, \naddressing a motion to dismiss. Rather, it was addressing the proof requirement at the summary \njudgment stage. Luna, 2016 WL 4679723, at *5.  \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 20 of 35\nDefendant’s  failure  to  muster  any  basis  whatsoever  to  certify  the  issue  for \ninterlocutory appeal demonstrates the utter baselessness of that request. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claim is Not Barred by Laches \n  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ claim is barred by laches. This argument fails \non multiple grounds. Not only does laches not apply to this prospective claim, but \neven if it did, Defendant fails to establish the essential elements of laches. \n  1.  Laches Does Not Bar Claims for Prospective Relief  \n \n  Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs’ § 2 claim is barred by laches fails \nbecause Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief to protect their rights in future \nelections, and therefore laches does not apply. See Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. \nWorld Inst. of Scientology Enters., 533 F.3d 1287, 1321 (11th Cir. 2008) (“[L]aches \nserves as a bar only to the recovery of retrospective damages, not to prospective \nrelief.”); see also Envtl. Def. Fund v. Marsh, 651 F.2d 983, 1005, n.32 (5th Cir. \n1981) (“[L]aches may not be used as a shield for future, independent violations of \nthe law. The concept of undue prejudice, an essential element in a defense of laches, \nis normally inapplicable when the relief is prospective.”). Thus, courts generally \nrefuse to apply laches in voting rights cases, like this one, where plaintiffs seek \nprospective relief to address “ongoing” injury. See, e.g., Garza v. Cty. of L.A., 918 \nF.2d 763, 772 (9th Cir. 1990); Smith v. Clinton, 687 F. Supp. 1310, 1312-13 (E.D. \nArk. 1988) (action not barred by laches because “the injury alleged by the plaintiffs \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 21 of 35\nis continuing, suffered anew each time a State Representative election is held”). \nHere, Plaintiffs seek entirely prospective relief. See Am. Compl. ¶ 109 (Defendant’s \nactions represent ongoing violations under the VRA and Defendant “will continue \nto violate [Plaintiffs’ Section 2] rights absent relief granted by this Court”). Thus, \nlaches does not bar their claims. \n  2.   Defendant Fails to Establish the Essential Elements of Laches  \n  Even if laches could apply, it should not apply here. Laches is only available \nwhen the party seeking to avoid liability establishes three essential elements: (1) a \ndelay in asserting a right or claim, which (2) was not excusable, and (3) caused undue \nprejudice to the party against whom the claim is asserted. AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., \n812 F.2d 1531, 1545 (11th Cir. 1986). Defendant bears the burden of establishing \neach element, see Keefe v. Bah. Cruise Lines, Inc., 867 F.2d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir. \n1989), and he fails to carry it. \n  i.   Plaintiffs did not “inexcusably delay” \n  The first and second elements of laches require the court to assess the length \nof Plaintiffs’ delay, “measured from the time at which the plaintiff knows or should \nknow she has a provable claim,” and to assess whether such delay was reasonable or \ninexcusable. Kason Indus., Inc. v. Component Hardware Grp., Inc., 120 F.3d 1199, \n1206 (11th Cir. 1997). Furthermore, the Court must assess, separately, the extent and \nreasonableness of each plaintiff’s purported delay in bringing suit, and may not \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 22 of 35\nsimply impute knowledge of voting rights violations from once citizen to another. \nSee Nader 2000 Primary Comm., Inc. v. Hechler, 112 F. Supp. 2d 575, 579 n.2 \n(S.D.W.Va. 2000) (holding that a political candidate and political party plaintiff’s \ndelay in asserting First Amendment challenge to ballot access laws did not apply to \nregistered-voter co-plaintiffs); see also Garden City Boxing Club, Inc. v. Johnson, \n552 F. Supp. 2d 611, 618 (N.D. Tex. 2008) (“The Court is unaware of any case that \nimputes the delay of a plaintiff in one case to a different plaintiff in another case \nsimply because the plaintiffs shared the same attorneys.”).  \nDefendant misinterprets this threshold element in suggesting that Plaintiffs \nshould have known they had a provable claim as early as February 2011. Mot. at \n17.5 He does not point to a single authority that would require Plaintiffs to predict \nthat their votes will be diluted immediately upon the passage of redistricting plan \n(or, in the case of Ms. Chestnut, before she ever resided in Alabama). But see Nader \n2000 Primary Comm., 112 F. Supp. 2d at 579 n.2 (“Ordinary citizens should not be \nforced to anticipate and predict possible constitutional violations . . .”). Indeed, the \nEleventh Circuit has repeatedly rejected this broad interpretation of laches that \nwould  require  plaintiffs  to  forego  any  investigation  of  potential  voting  rights \nviolations, or to “sue first and ask questions later.” Kason Indus., 120 F.3d at 1206 \n(quoting  J.  THOMAS  MCCARTHY,  MCCARTHY  ON  TRADEMARKS  AND  UNFAIR \n                                                           \n5 The congressional plan challenged here was not enacted until June 8, 2011. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 23 of 35\nCOMPETITION § 31.19 (4th ed. 1997)). The Court recognized that “a plaintiff’s \nreasonable need to fully investigate its claims” may excuse a delay in filing suit, and \nthat to hold otherwise “would create a powerful and perverse incentive for plaintiffs \nto file premature and even frivolous suits to avoid the invocation of laches.” Black \nWarrior Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 781 F.3d 1271, 1285 (11th \nCir. 2015). \nDefendant also ignores the fact that Ms. Chestnut did not become a resident \nof Alabama until 2016, Am. Compl. ⁋ 13, and, thus, cannot be charged with delay \nin asserting claims that did not even exist. Cf. Correll v. Herring, 212 F. Supp. 3d \n584, 617 n. 29 (E.D. Va. 2016) (“[Plaintiff] could not have challenged a statute that \nallegedly impinges on the First Amendment rights of delegates when he was not a \ndelegate.”). Like all other litigants, Ms. Chestnut was entitled to investigate and \nprepare her claims, rather than pursuing legal action immediately upon moving to \nAlabama. Black Warrior, 78 F.3d at 1285. This is especially true for claims asserted \nunder § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which require evidence that bloc voting by a \nwhite  majority  is  usually  sufficient  to  defeat  the  minority  group’s  preferred \ncandidate. See Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1313 (denying laches defense based on time \nneeded to develop evidence of Voting Rights Act violation). In some instances, such \nevidence may require multiple elections to establish, and may be “unavailable unless \nthe [challenged] structure ha[s] been in place for some time.” Id. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 24 of 35\nIn short, Defendant has not pointed to any evidence that suggests Plaintiffs \nunreasonably delayed the filing of this suit.  \nii.  Defendant Has Not Identified Any Prejudice Attributable to the \nAlleged Delay in Filing this Lawsuit. \n \n  Compounding the absence of any unreasonable delay is Defendant’s failure \nto identify any prejudice caused by the timing of this lawsuit. To establish this \nelement,  Defendant  must  demonstrate  harm  that  is  attributable  specifically  to \nPlaintiffs’ alleged delay. See Black Warrior, 781 F.3d at 1286. Courts applying \nlaches have drawn a clear distinction between prejudice caused by the delay in \nasserting one’s rights, and the harm that results merely from losing a case on the \nmerits. See id. (explaining that prejudice must stem from the delay, “rather than from \nthe consequences of an adverse decision on the merits . . . .”); see also Baylor Univ. \nMed. Ctr. v. Heckler, 758 F.2d 1052, 1058 (5th Cir. 1985) (rejecting laches defense \nbecause defendant’s alleged “prejudice would arise essentially from a decision on \nthe merits . . . rather than from the [plaintiff’s] delay in bringing suit”); Matter of \nBohart, 743 F.2d 313, 327 (5th Cir. 1984) (“Nor is there prejudicial harm merely \nbecause one loses what otherwise he would have kept; there must be a delay which \ncauses a disadvantage in asserting and establishing a claimed right or defense.”); \nAriz. Minority Coal. for Fair Redistricting v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n, 366 \nF. Supp. 2d 887, 908 (D. Ariz. 2005) (acknowledging two forms of prejudice \nrelevant  to  laches:  “evidentiary  and  expectations-based  [prejudice]”)  (quoting \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 25 of 35\nDanjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 955 (9th Cir. 2001)). In other words, the \nparty invoking laches must establish that he or she was “[was] made significantly \nworse off because [Plaintiffs] did not bring suit as soon as [they] had the opportunity \nto do so.” Black Warrior, 781 F.3d at 1286. \nWhat Defendant describes as prejudice are simply consequences of an adverse \nruling on the merits, which are plainly insufficient to demonstrate laches. Defendant \ncontends, for instance, that Plaintiffs’ action may result in multiple redistrictings \nwithin a short period of time and more use of the legislature’s resources. But that \nwould be true of any successful claim challenging a districting plan, whether filed \nimmediately or several years after its enactment. See Shuford v. Ala. State Bd. of \nEduc. 920 F. Supp. 1233, 1239-40 (M.D. Ala. 1996) (rejecting laches defense, \nfinding no “reason why it would be more difficult to litigate a § 5 claim” at the time \nplaintiffs filed suit “than it would have been if the claim had been raised at the time \nthe [change in election practice or procedure occurred]”); Ga. State Conf. of NAACP \nv. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 996 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1357-58 (recognizing that a \n§2 violation is remedied by a court or legislatively-drawn redistricting plan). In \nLarios v. Cox, for instance, a three-judge panel’s ruling striking Georgia’s 2002 state \nlegislative reapportionment plan—in a case filed less than a year after the plan was \nenacted—resulted in multiple redistrictings (in 2002 and 2004) within a two-year \nspan. 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (N.D. Ga. 2004), aff’d, 542 U.S. 947 (2004). In other \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 26 of 35\nwords, “back-to-back” redistricting—even without the benefit of up-to-date census \ndata—is  an  inevitable  consequence  of  protecting  the  right  to  vote  when  the \nlegislature fails to get it right the first time.    \nThese cases also demonstrate that the absence of up-to-date Census data \nshould not preclude a court from affording relief to African-American voters who \nhave been denied the right to participate equally in the political process. It would \nmake little sense to reject a remedial map as “prejudicial,” while permitting the \ncontinued use of an unlawful districting plan that relies on the same 2010 Census \ndata. If the State is going to hold elections in 2020 based on 2010 data (which it will \nregardless of the outcome of this case), it should do so in a way that does not dilute \nAfrican-American voting strength.  \nDefendant’s argument is even less compelling when considering that prior \nCensus figures are “the relevant data for assessing a claim under Section [2].” \nDickinson v. Ind. State Election Bd., 933 F.2d 497, 503 (7th Cir. 1991). Following \nDefendant’s approach, the Court would be required to rely on 2010 Census data in \ndetermining whether the redistricting plan complies with the law, yet declare such \ndata unreliable in crafting a remedy, which is nonsensical and would eliminate all \navenues for relief in almost all mid-decade vote dilution and gerrymandering claims. \nIn short, mid-cycle redistricting based on decennial census data is commonplace and \nis not a form of prejudice. Indeed, while Defendant chooses to discount the voting \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 27 of 35\nrights injury Plaintiffs will face in the 2020 election based on its proximity to the \nnext decennial redistricting process, that election is no less important than the four \nothers that have taken place under an unlawful plan. See Smith, 687 F. Supp. at 1312-\n13 (action not barred by laches because “the injury alleged by the plaintiffs is \ncontinuing, suffered anew each time a State Representative election is held”). \nDefendant, meanwhile, views it as a foregone conclusion that this case cannot \npossibly be concluded in time for the 2020 elections. To be sure, Defendant’s \nlitigation tactics thus far—refusing to exchange initial disclosures, Doc. 29, pg. 1-2, \ncalling for an unnecessarily protracted case schedule, id. at 3, seeking a stay of all \ndiscovery until the Court rules on the present motion, Doc. 28, and demanding \nmultiple piecemeal interlocutory appeals, Mot. at 8, 15—seem directed at ensuring \njust that. Defendant’s complaints about an extended litigation ring hollow where he \nis actively working to ensure further delay. Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint \nmore than two years before the 2020 election and have requested a trial date eight \nmonths before the 2020 primary and 16 months before the 2020 general election. \nSee Doc. 29, pg. 4. Defendant has identified no reason why this (primarily expert-\ndriven) case cannot proceed on that schedule.6 \n                                                           \n6 Defendant further faults Plaintiffs for “insisting that this case not follow the most expeditious \nroute to a final decision” by pursuing a three-judge panel, Mot. at 16, failing to recognize that a \nthree-judge panel would not have jurisdiction over this § 2 claim. See supra at 3-13. Nor does a \nthree-judge panel ensure a speedy resolution. On the contrary, “[c]onvening a three-judge court . \n. . may often result in a delay in a matter needing swift initial adjudication.” Allen, 393 U.S. at \n561–62. \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 28 of 35\nDefendant points to Abbott v. Perez and Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. \nAlabama to suggest that this case may take years to resolve on appeal. Mot. at 16 \nn.9. But those cases involved constitutional claims heard by three-judge panels with \nmandatory review by the U.S. Supreme Court.7 Defendant’s suggestion here that he \nmight choose to appeal a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor hardly means that the Court \nshould not allow Plaintiffs to pursue their claim. Courts do not shrug at legal \nviolations just because a losing party may try to appeal. Defendant’s argument \nimplies he is entitled to some sort of automatic stay of any ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor, \ncontrary to the legal standard. See Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (11th \nCir. 1986) (a stay pending appeal is “an exceptional response granted only upon a \nshowing  of  four  factors,”  including  a  “likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  on \nappeal”).  \n3.  Defendant’s Authorities Are Inapt and Distinguishable \nDefendant incorrectly relies on four primary authorities, Sanders v. Dooly \nCounty, GA, Fouts v. Harris, White v. Daniel, and MacGovern v. Connolly, to \nsupport his flawed theory of prejudice. All are clearly distinguishable and fail to \nsupport Defendant’s laches defense.  \n                                                           \n7 Abbott v. Perez, 138 S.Ct. 2305 (2018), was stalled by the need for federal preclearance of the \noriginally-challenged map under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act and the Texas Legislature’s \ndecision to adopt a new legislative map before the court issued a final judgment, prompting \nmultiple trials.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 29 of 35\nIn Sanders v. Dooly County, GA, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court \norder dismissing, based on laches, a lawsuit to enjoin a county commission and \nboard of education districting plan. 245 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding \nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion). The Eleventh Circuit’s opinion \ndid not include any analysis of the alleged forms of prejudice to defendants, but \nsimply held that the district court had not abused its discretion. Id. Nothing in the \nEleventh  Circuit’s opinion  requires this Court to accept  Defendant’s  claims  of \nprejudice, as even the court in Sanders recognized that laches is not available as a \ndefense  where  the  alleged  harm  resulting  from  plaintiffs’  delay  “is  no  more \nprejudicial to the defendants now than it would have been [earlier in the decennial \ncycle].” Id. at 1291-92 (holding that the district court “overstepped its discretion” in \napplying laches to dismiss claims for declaratory relief); see also Black Warrior, 781 \nF.3d at 1286. As explained above, the “cost” of redistricting to remedy vote dilution \nin  this  case  is  no  more  prejudicial  in 2018  than  it  would  have  been  in  2013. \nDefendant does not argue otherwise, nor does he point to any evidence to support \nhis implied theory that redistricting is somehow costlier for the State later in the \ndecade. Because the burden of complying with the law, by itself, is not a form of \nprejudice under the doctrine of laches, Defendant has not established the required \nelements of this defense, notwithstanding the ruling in Sanders.8  \n                                                           \n8 Furthermore, obvious factual distinctions between the school board elections in Sanders and the \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 30 of 35\nFor  the  same  reason,  Defendant’s  reliance  on  Fouts  v.  Harris—and  the \nDistrict of Florida’s focus on voter confusion as a form of prejudice—is misplaced \nhere. 88 F. Supp. 2d 1351, 1354 (S.D. Fla. 1999). Putting aside the fact that Fouts is \nnot binding on this court, redistricting to remedy a § 2 violation will always require \nthe reallocation of some voters to different districts. Defendant does not explain why \nvoter confusion from re-drawn districts, if any, would be greater now than it would \nhave been earlier in the decade. The purported harm that Defendant asserts is not the \nresult of any delay in filing the lawsuit, but rather the inevitable result of a court’s \ndetermination that the current Congressional district boundaries have unlawfully \ndiluted African-American votes in those districts.  \nFinally, the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in White v. Daniel is inapposite because \nthe  plaintiffs  in  that  case  filed  suit  seventeen  years  after  the  alleged  unlawful \nredistricting, and after the County had already held its last election of the decade \nunder the operative plan. See White v. Daniel, 909 F.2d 99, 101 (4th Cir. 1990). \nNotably, the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in that case relied in part on “principles of \nequity” which “require a federal court to stay its hand when judicial relief makes no \nsense.” Id. at 104. The court also acknowledged that “court-ordered reapportionment \n                                                           \nCongressional races here counsel against applying that ruling blindly to all forms of redistricting \nas the State appears to suggest. For instance, unlike the school board and county commission \nelections  at  issue  in  Sanders,  voter  confusion  over  district  boundaries  is  far  less  likely  in \nCongressional races, which are typically better funded and highly publicized. \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 31 of 35\n. . . would be completely gratuitous[] because there are no elections scheduled before \nNovember 1991 . . . .” Id. Similarly, in MacGovern v. Connolly, the District Court \nof Massachusetts relied on principles of equity to reject plaintiffs’ request for relief. \nThere, plaintiffs did not file their complaint challenging a redistricting plan that was \ndrawn based on the previous census until after the new census had already been \nconducted and the population numbers were in the process of being finalized. 637 F. \nSupp. 111, 113 (D. Mass. 1986). They also filed their complaint less than a month \nbefore nominations in the next election were due, roughly three months before the \nprimary, and less than eight months before the general election. Id. at 115. While \nthese  equitable  considerations  counseled  against  judicial  relief  in  White  and \nMacGovern, they stand in stark contrast to this lawsuit, which Plaintiffs have filed \nonly six years after the first election following the 2011 redistricting and two years \nbefore the next congressional election, and which seeks relief that will have a direct \nimpact on the 2020 elections. Under the standards announced by the Eleventh Circuit \nin applying the doctrine of laches, neither the facts nor the court’s reasoning in White \nor MacGovern supports Defendant’s argument.9 \n                                                           \n9 Plaintiffs maintain that the applicable case law and particular allegations here support a finding \nthat this case, and specifically Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief, is not barred by laches. But \neven if the Court does not agree that laches fails here as a legal matter, it should reserve any \ndecision on Defendant’s affirmative defense until after the facts have been developed. District \ncourts have generally found that challenges to an action based on the doctrine of laches are “not \namenable to dismissal at the pleadings stage” precisely because they are inherently fact-specific. \nAm. Nat’l Prop. & Cas. Co. v. Tosh, No. 5:12-CV-00051, 2013 WL 1311399, at *3 (W.D. Ky. \nMar. 27, 2013); see also Williamson v. Recovery Ltd. P’ship, No. C2-06-292, 2009 WL 3172648, \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 32 of 35\n4.  Plaintiffs’ Claims for Declaratory Relief are Not Barred by Laches. \n  Even if the Court agreed that laches bars any relief in the form of court-\nordered redistricting before the 2020 election, Defendant’s laches defense does not \napply to Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory judgment. See Sanders, 245 F.3d at 1291. \nDefendant’s argument that the Sanders reasoning does not apply here is incorrect. \nAs the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in Sanders, none of the purported grounds \nfor prejudice associated with late-decade redistricting would apply to a claim for a \ndeclaration  that the  current  redistricting map  is  unlawful.  See  id.  Furthermore, \nDefendant’s  attempt  to  portray  declaratory  relief  as  a  mere  academic  exercise \nignores the realities of the legislative redistricting process. The Legislature does not \n“wipe the slate clean from one decade to the next, and . . . a plan whose [legal] \ndefects are left unidentified and unremedied could leave its own [unlawful] mark on \nthe next plan.” Kelley v. Bennett, 96 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1306-07 (M.D. Ala. 2000), \nvacated on other grounds, 531 U.S. 28 (2000); see also Dickinson, 933 F.2d  at 503 \n(holding that district court judge “misconstrued the function of declaratory relief” in \napplying  laches  to  dismiss  declaratory  judgment  claim,  and  that  “declaratory \njudgment provides relief when legal or equitable remedies are too intrusive or are \notherwise  inappropriate”).  In  this  case,  declaratory  relief  serves  the  important \n                                                           \nat *4 (S.D. Ohio. Sept. 30, 2009) (same); Ultra-Images, LLC v. Franclemont, No. 05-60538-CIV, \n2005 WL 8154576, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 8, 2005) (same). \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 33 of 35\nfunction of ensuring that the next congressional districting map does not build upon \nand exacerbate the voting rights violations that pervade the current plan. This is true \nregardless of whether the speculation that Alabama may lose a congressional seat \nfollowing the 2020 Census comes to pass. Therefore, notwithstanding Defendant’s \nlaches defense, Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory judgment precludes the dismissal of \nthis action. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ opposition \nbrief to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \ndeny Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 31   Filed 11/30/18   Page 34 of 35\nDated:  November 30, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nBy /s/ Aria Branch      \nMarc Erik Elias (admitted pro hac vice) \nBruce V.

MERRILL, etc.,     ) \n            ) \n  Defendant.      ) \nMOTION TO INTERVENE \nComes now Alabama Senator Jim McClendon, as an Alabama Senator and \nmember  of  the  Alabama  Legislature’s  Permanent  Legislative  Committee  on \nReapportionment, and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24, respectfully moves for leave \nto intervene as a defendant in his official capacity, and as grounds shows the \nfollowing: \nTHE INTERVENOR \n1.  Drawing  congressional  districts  is  the  duty  of  the  Alabama \nLegislature. Abbott v. Perez, 138 S.Ct. 2305, 2316 (June 25, 2018) (noting that \n“[r]edistricting  is  ‘primarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  State’”).  To \nfacilitate this and other redistricting activities, the Alabama Legislature created \nthe Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment. See Ala. Code §§ 29-\n2-50 to -53. The Reapportionment Committee is responsible for the “preparation \nand formulation” of redistricting plans and the “readjustment or alteration of … \ncongressional districts” for the State of Alabama.  Ala. Code § 29-2-52(c). See also \n \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 2 of 9\nid. § 29-2-52(a)-(b) (charging the Reapportionment Committee with conducting \na  continuous  study  of  “reapportionment”1  problems  and  reporting  to  the \nLegislature its findings and  recommendations)  and § 29-2-52(e) (empowering \nthe Reapportionment Committee “to do and perform any such acts that may be \nnecessary, desirable, or proper to carry out the purposes and objectives” of the \nstatutes creating it). \n2.  Alabama’s current seven congressional districts were drawn under \nthe  aegis  of  the  Reapportionment  Committee,  were  passed  by  the  Alabama \nLegislature as S.B. 484 (now codified at Ala. Code § 17-14-70), were signed into \nlaw by the Governor, were precleared under then-enforceable Section 5 of the \nVoting Rights Act by United States Attorney General Eric Holder2 on November \n21, 2011, and have since been enforced as the congressional districts of Alabama. \nThese districts will as of course be redrawn in 2021 after the 2020 Census results \nare  released  in  (probably)  February  2021,  in  preparation  for  Congressional \nelections in 2022.3 \n                                                 \n1  The  terms  “reapportionment”  and  “redistricting”  have  been  used \ninterchangeably  by  the  Alabama  Legislature.  See,  e.g.,  Permanent  Legislative \nCommittee on Reapportionment, Redistricting History, http://www.legislature. \nstate.al.us/aliswww_LCC/ISD/ALReap_History.aspx (last visited July 23, 2018).  \n2 According to press reports, Mr. Holder is the chair of the National Democratic \nRedistricting  Committee,  which  in  the  guise  of  the  National  Redistricting \nFoundation  is  “backing”  the  Chestnut  case  and  similar  cases  in  Georgia  and \nLouisiana. See https://www.apnews.com/d30b289c43f543 079555304f2be53b6a \n(last visited July 23, 2018).\n \n3  The  2021  regular  session  of  the  Alabama  Legislature,  at  which  redrawing \ncongressional districts could be accomplished, will open on Tuesday, February \n12, 2021. \n257410.1 \n2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 3 of 9\n3.  Jim McClendon is a resident and citizen of St. Clair County and is \nthe  State  Senator  for  Senate  District  11  (Shelby,  St.  Clair,  and  Talladega \nCounties). In 2011, when the 2010 Census results were released, Sen. McClendon \nwas a member of the Alabama House of Representatives and was the House Chair \nof  the  Legislature’s  Permanent  Committee  on  Reapportionment.  Then-Rep. \nMcClendon authored the congressional districts plan, then known as the “2010 \nMcClendon Congressional Districts 1” plan, that became § 17-14-70. (Then-Rep. \nMcClendon and Senate Reapportionment Committee Co-Chair Gerald Dial also \nprepared the 2012 redistricting plans for the Alabama Legislature and the State \nBoard of Education and shepherded them through the Alabama Legislature.) \nTHE LITIGATION \n4.  Plaintiffs allege that in 2011 Alabama engaged in vote dilution in \nCongressional  Districts  1,  2,  3,  and  7,  or  some  combination  of  them.  See \nComplaint, doc. 1, ¶ 3 (alleging that African American voters were assigned to \nDistrict 1, 2, or 3 on the basis of their race).  \n5.  Plaintiffs  ask  the  Court  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  the  current \ncongressional  districts  and  to  order  Alabama  to  adopt  a  new  congressional \ndistricts plan that includes two majority-black districts. Doc. 1, prayer for relief. \nARGUMENT FOR INTERVENTION \n \n6.  Sen. McClendon should be permitted to intervene under Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  24(b)(1)(B), which provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \n \n257410.1 \n3 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 4 of 9\n(1) In General. On a timely motion, the court may permit anyone \nto intervene who: \n   … \n \n    (B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a       \ncommon question of law or fact.  \n \n7.  Sen. McClendon has “a claim or defense that shares with the main \naction a common question of law or fact.” Id.  Sen. McClendon seeks intervention \nto assert factual and legal defenses to defend the Reapportionment Committee’s \nand Legislature’s redistricting activities, to argue for the  constitutionality and \nlawfulness of § 17-14-70, and to argue against the remedy for which plaintiffs \npray, which would impose on the prerogatives and duties of the Reapportionment \nCommittee and the Legislature.  \n8.   “The  Constitution  entrusts  States  with  the  job  of  designing \ncongressional  districts.”  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.Ct.  1455,  1463  (2017).  As  a \nformer and prospective future Chair of the Reapportionment Committee, and \nauthor of “2010 McClendon Congressional  Districts 1” and other redistricting \nplans, Sen. McClendon is particularly well informed to contribute to the defense \nof  the  State’s  congressional  redistricting  plan,  and  to  assist  the  Court  in \ndetermining  whether  it  should  intrude  upon  the  Legislature’s  redistricting \nauthority. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995).  \n9.  In addition, no party in this case has Sen. McClendon’s redistricting \nexperience,  and  it  will  benefit  the  quality  of  litigation  and,  if  necessary,  any \nremedy to have a party in the case who is experienced in redistricting.  If the \n257410.1 \n4 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 5 of 9\nCourt  were  to  order  Alabama  to  draw  new  congressional  districts,  Sen. \nMcClendon would necessarily be at the center of that activity.  \n10.  Absent intervention, Sen. McClendon will not be able to protect the \ninterests  of  the  Reapportionment  Committee  in  this  action,  and  through  the \nReapportionment Committee, the interests of the Legislature, in protecting the \ncongressional districts drawn in 2012, and in defending the Reapportionment \nCommittee’s and the Legislature’s redistricting prerogatives. \n11.  Sen.  McClendon  also  seeks  intervention  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n24(b)(2), which states: \n(2) By a Government Officer of Agency. On timely motion, the \ncourt  may  permit  a  …  state  governmental  officer  or  agency  …  to \nintervene if a party’s claim or defense is based on: \n \n  (A) a statute … administered by the officer or agency; or \n \n(B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued  \nor made under the statute ….  \n \n12.  Chestnut’s  lawsuit  challenges  the  manner  in  which  Alabama’s \nLegislature  exercised its duty to draw congressional districts, i.e., challenges how \nthe Reapportionment Committee fulfilled its statutory  duties under Ala. Code \n§ 29-2-52(c)    to  draw  new  congressional  districts.  In  addition,  defending  the \nState’s  congressional  districts  will  include  defending  the  Reapportionment \nCommittee’s Guidelines, which are requirements that established priorities for \ndrawing districts in 2011. Thus, Chestnut’s lawsuit requires a defense based on a \nstatute and a requirement made under that statute. \n257410.1 \n5 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 6 of 9\n13.  Consequently,  Sen.  McClendon  should  be  permitted  to  intervene \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  See e.g., Graham v. Thornburgh, 207 F. Supp. \n2d  1280,  1285  (D.  Kan.  2002)  (in  an  action  challenging  the  plan  for \napportionment of congressional districts in the State of Kansas, district court \npermitted state legislator and Chairman of the House Redistricting Committee, \nwho appeared “on behalf of himself as a legislator and as Chairman of the House \nRedistricting Committee” to intervene pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b); Scott v. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Justice,  920  F.  Supp.  1248,  1250  (M.D.  Fla.  1996)  (granting \nintervention by both houses of Florida’s Legislature in a legislative districting \ncase), aff’d sub nom, Lawyer v. Dep’t of Justice, 521 U.S. 567 (1997). \n14.  Allowing  Sen.  McClendon  to  intervene  would  be  consistent  with \nprior federal court decisions. A predecessor of the Reapportionment Committee \nwas permitted to intervene in the voting rights case known as Sims v. Amos, 336 \nF. Supp. 924, as supplemented, 340 F. Supp. 691 (M.D. Ala. 1972), aff’d, 409 U.S. \n942  (1972).  More  recently,  the  Reapportionment  Committee  was  allowed  to \nintervene as a defendant in the consolidated cases that made a timely challenge \nto Alabama legislative districts, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. State of \nAlabama,  case  no.  2:12-CV-691  (three-judge  court)  and  Newton  v.  State  of \nAlabama, case no. 2:12-cv-1081 (three-judge court), doc. 90 (March 3, 2013) \n(granting motion to intervene as defendants), see generally Alabama Legislative \nBlack Caucus v. State of Alabama, 989 F.Supp.2d 1227, 1238 (M.D. Ala. 2013). \n   \n257410.1 \n6 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 7 of 9\nTIMELINESS \n15.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24 requires that a motion to intervene be timely. This \ncase was commenced on June 13, 2018, and on July 23, 2018 the plaintiffs filed \nan amended complaint, doc. 14. A trial date has not yet been set, and no discovery \nhas occurred.  Given that this action is still in a very early stage, this motion is \ntimely. \nNO PREJUDICE OR DELAY \n  16.  Intervention  or  participation  by  Sen.  McClendon  will  not  unduly \ndelay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.  \nNOTICE AND PLEADING \n  17.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c), Sen. McClendon has served this \nmotion on all parties. Sen. McClendon has attached to this motion his proposed \nresponse to the amended complaint. See Exhibit 1.  \nNO OBJECTION BY THE DEFENDANT  \n  18.  Counsel for Sen. McClendon is authorized to represent to the Court \nthat the Secretary of State Merrill does not object to Sen. McClendon intervening \nin this action. \nCONCLUSION \n19.  Based  on  the  foregoing,  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  24,  Sen. \nMcClendon respectfully moves the Court to grant this motion to intervene.  \n   \n257410.1 \n7 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19   Filed 08/27/18   Page 8 of 9\nRespectfully submitted this the 27th day of August, 2018. \n/s/Dorman Walker   \nCounsel for Intervenor \n \nOF COUNSEL:   \n \nDorman Walker (ASB-9154-R81J)   \ndwalker@balch.com \nBALCH & BINGHAM LLP \nPost Office Box 78 \nMontgomery, AL 36101-0078 \nTelephone: (334) 834-6500 \nFacsimile: (334) 269-3115 \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI certify that on August 27, 2018, I electronically filed the foregoing with \nthe Clerk of the Court using the CM/ECF system which will send a copy to the \nfollowing: \nAria C.

To \navoid a three-judge court, the plaintiffs (hereinafter collectively, “Chestnut”) have \nbrought their challenge under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act only – i.e., they make a \nstatutory challenge, not a constitutional one - and have uniquely eschewed claims \nunder  the  14th  and  15th  Amendments,  which  otherwise  uniformly  are  made \ntogether with such § 2 claims.  See Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d 175, 190 (3rd. Cir. \n2001)  (observing  that  “statutory  Voting  Rights  Act  challenges  to  statewide \nlegislative  apportionment  are  generally”  so  “inextricably  intertwined  with \nconstitutional challenges to such apportionment” that they “should be considered \na single ‘action’ within the meaning of § 2284(a)”); see also Johnson v. Ardoin2, \nNo. 18-cv-625-SDD-EWD (M.D. La. July 31, 2018) (Memorandum in Support of \n                                                 \n1   Sen. McClendon questions whether this case should be heard by a single-\njudge or a three-judge district court, but regardless of the ruling on that issue, \nthis (single-judge) Court has jurisdiction to dismiss this case if it determines that \nthe  plaintiffs’  claims  are  “wholly  insubstantial  or  completely  without  merit.” \nUnited States v. St. Landry Parish School Board, 601 F.2d 859, 863 (5th Cir. \n1979) (re § 5 of the Voting Rights Act); accord Kalson v. Paterson, 542 F.3d 281, \n287 (2nd Cir. 2008) (“Although 28 U.S.C § 2284 is jurisdictional, it has long been \nheld that a single judge may dismiss a claim that must normally be heard by a \nthree-judge court if it is insubstantial.”).  \n2   The instant case, Chestnut, is one of three cases challenging congressional \ndistricts reportedly filed under the aegis of the National Democratic Redistricting \nCommittee,  dba  the  National  Redistricting  Foundation.  See \nhttps://www.apnews.com/d30b289c43f543079555304f2be53b6a  (last  visited \nJuly 23, 2018). The other two are Dwight v. Kemp, No. 1:18-cv-2869 (N.D. Ga. \nJune 13, 2018) and Johnson v. Ardoin, No. 3:13-cv-625-SDD-EWD (M.D. Ga. \nJune 13, 2018). All three cases make the same basic legal argument under § 2 of \nthe VRA, and make no parallel constitutional claims.\n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 4 of 50\nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss a parallel challenge to Louisiana’s congressional \ndistricts, p. 3, n. 1 (pointing out the rarity of reapportionment challenges that do \nnot include claims under the 14th and 15th Amendments as well as § 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act))(attached as Exhibit A).  \n  The argument that this statutory challenge should be heard by a three-\njudge court comes down to the language of § 2284(a) and what Congress knew \nwhen it last amended that statute. The argument that Congress meant for all \nchallenges to congressional reapportionment to be heard by three-judge courts is \nably  made  by  the  Attorney  General  of  Louisiana  in  its  motion  to  dismiss  in \nJohnson  v.  Ardoin,  Ex.  A,  pp.  2-6,  which  Sen.  McClendon  adopts  with  the \nadditional observation that Chestnut’s argument ultimately rests on the sort of \n“magic language” that the Supreme Court disavowed in Abbott v. Perez, 138 S.Ct. \n2305 (Jun. 25, 2018). In that case the Supreme Court was required to determine, \nfor jurisdictional purposes, if a three-judge court’s order was an injunction - and \nthus appealable - even though the three-judge court did not call it an injunction. \nDoing so required the Supreme Court to consider the wording of two statutes \nrelating to interlocutory appeals, 28 U.S.C. § 1253 and § 1292(a)(1):  \nThe orders in these cases fall within § 1253 [allowing appeal of “an \norder granting … an interlocutory … injunction”]. To be sure, the \nDistrict  Court  did  not  call  its  orders  “injunctions”  –  in  fact,  it \ndisclaimed  the  term  …  but  the  label  attached  to  an  order  is  not \ndispositive. We have previously made clear that where an order has \nthe ‘practical effect’ of granting or denying an injunction, it should be \ntreated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction. … We applied \nthis test in Carson [v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79 (1981)], \nholding  that  an  order  that  declined  to  enter  a  consent  decree \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 5 of 50\nprohibiting  certain  conduct could  be appealed under § 1292(a)(1) \nbecause  it  was  the  practical  equivalent  of  an  order  denying  an \ninjunction and threatened serious and perhaps irreparable harm if \nnot immediately reviewed.  \n \nThis  ‘practical  effect’  rule  serves  a  valuable  purpose.  If  an \ninterlocutory injunction is improperly granted or denied, much harm \ncan occur before the final decision in the district court. Lawful and \nimportant  conduct  may  be  barred,  and  unlawful  and  harmful \nconduct  may  be  allowed  to  continue.  Recognizing  this,  Congress \nauthorized interlocutory appellate review for such orders. But if the \navailability of interlocutory review depended on the district court’s \nuse  of  the  term  ‘injunction’  or  some  other  particular  language, \nCongress’s scheme would be frustrated. The harms that Congress \nwanted to avoid could occur so long as the district court was careful \nabout its terminology. The ‘practical  effect’ inquiry prevents such \nmanipulation. \n \n \nAbbott,  138  S.Ct.  at  2319-2320.  The  Court  then  explained  that  although  its \n“‘practical  effect’  approach”  was  developed  in  cases  dealing  with  §  1292(a)(1) \n[allowing  appeals  of  “[i]nterlocutory  orders  …  granting  injunctions”],  the \napproach also applies to § 1253: \nThe provisions are also textually interlocked. Section 1292(a)(1) does \nnot apply where “direct review may be had in the Supreme Court, \ni.e., where § 1253 applies. If the “practical effects” test applied under \n§ 1292(a)(1) but not § 1253, the consequences would be unfortunate \nand strange. We would have to identify the magic language needed \nfor an order to qualify as an order granting or denying an injunction \n.... \n \nAbbott, 138 S.Ct. at 2320.  \n  Just as with the interlocutory appeal statutes the Supreme Court discussed \nin Abbott, challenges to congressional districts under the Constitution and the \nVoting Rights Act are interrelated. Page, 248 F.3d at 190 (“More significantly, it \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 6 of 50\nis clear that questions regarding  the legitimacy of an  apportionment scheme, \nwhether  under  the  Constitution  or  the  Voting  Rights  Act  …  are  ‘intimately \nrelated’….”). The amended complaint shows ignoring this interrelation frustrates \nCongress’  reason  in  1976  for  continuing  to  require  that  challenges  to \ncongressional districts be heard by three-judge courts. As the relevant Senate \nReport  said:  “The  bill  preserves  three-judge  courts  for  cases  involving \ncongressional reapportionment … because it is the judgment of the committee \nthat these issues are of such importance that they ought to be heard by a three-\njudge court ….” S. REP. 94-204, at 1996 (1975).  \n  The “practical effect” of a successful challenge to congressional districts is \nthe same regardless of whether the claim is brought under §2 or under the 14th \nand  15th Amendments. To ignore this fact would  grant Chestnut an  end run \naround  the procedure that  Congress intended  to be used when  congressional \ndistricts  are  challenged:  a  three-judge  court  and  quick  direct  appeal  to  the \nSupreme Court.3 Because the practical effects of these challenges are the same, \nthey should be treated the same. Page, 248 F.3d at 190 (“[W]e conclude that \nbecause  statutory  Voting  Rights  Act  challenges  to  statewide  legislative \napportionment  are  generally  inextricably  intertwined  with  constitutional \n                                                 \n3   Given the importance of the interests at issue, it is probably inevitable that \nthe decision of the district court will be appealed by one side or the other, and for \nthis  reason  Chestnut’s  refusal  to  take  advantage  of  the  far  speedier  appeal \navailable under § 2284(a) is a continuation by different means of her inexcusable \ndelay in commencing this lawsuit, which is addressed below.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 7 of 50\nchallenges to such apportionment, those claims should be considered a single \n‘action’ within the meaning of § 2284(a)”). \n  On a related point, in Chestnut’s response to Secretary Merrill’s motion to \ndismiss, Chestnut responds to the argument (not made by Secretary Merrill)  that \nwhen Congress narrowed the scope of § 2284 in 1976, it did so under the belief \nthat all statewide reapportionment challenges would be constitutional, meaning \nthat  the  language  Congress  used  -  “when  an  action  is  filed  challenging  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  apportionment  of  congressional  districts  or  the \napportionment of any statewide legislative body” – did not reflect a choice that \nstatutory claims would not be heard before three-judge courts.  Congress could \nhave  made  no  such  choice  because  in  1976  no  such  choice  existed:  all  such \napportionment  challenges  were  perforce  constitutional  until  1982,  when \nCongress revised the Voting Rights Act to allow statutory vote dilutions claims. \nSee  generally,  Page,  284  F.3d  189-190  (explaining  the  history  of  §  2284). \nChestnut responds that Alabama’s “claim that Section 2 was not available for \nreapportionment challenges prior to 1982 seems dubious at best,” and cites to a \n1980 Fifth Circuit decision in which Section 2 was used to challenge an at-large \nelection scheme for a local school board. Doc. 15, p. 8, n.3. This argument misses \nthe  mark.  Even  assuming  statutory  vote  dilution  claims  were  possible  before \nCongress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982, the point remains that in 1976 \nwhen Congress narrowed the scope of § 2284, they were unheard of, and 1976, \nnot  1982,  is  what  matters  in  determining  Congressional  intent  behind  that \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 8 of 50\nstatute. The undersigned could not locate a vote dilution case brought under § 2 \nbefore 1976, when Congress amended the three-judge court statute. See Ex. B. \nThese results indicate that in 1976 there was no vote dilution claim under § 2; all \nsuch challenges were constitutional. E.g., Sims v. Baggett, 247 F. Supp. 96 (M.D. \nAla. 1965) (constitutional challenge Alabama legislative districts);  Kilgarlin v. \nMartin, 252 F. Supp. 404 (S.D. Tex. 1966) (constitutional challenge to Texas \nlegislative reapportionment plan); Turner v. McKeithen, 490 F.2d 191 (5th Cir. \n1973)  (constitutional  vote  dilution  challenge  to  proposed  multimember \nreapportionment plan). 4  \n  Congressional districting is important no matter how it is challenged, and a \nchallenge under § 2 implicates delicate federal-state balances just as much as a \nconstitutional challenge. This is precisely the kind of case that Congress intended \nto be heard by a three-judge court. See Page, 248 F.3d at 189 (“We do not believe \n                                                 \n4   The Third Circuit avoided the issue of § 2284’s applicability to statutory \nchallenges by concocting a practical solution. In  Cavanaugh v. Brock, 577 F. \nSupp. 176 (E.D.N.C. 1983), a challenge to North Carolina’s General Assembly’s \ndistricts, plaintiffs alleged violations of the state constitution– clearly not the sort \nof constitutional challenge envisioned for § 2284. In defense, North Carolina \nargued that the Voting Rights Act required it to split precincts (the alleged state \nconstitutional violation), and a question for court was whether raising a federal \nstatutory claim as a defense meant the case must be heard by a three-judge court. \nId., 577 F. Supp. at 180, n. 3 (“It is not clear to us that the invocation of a federal \ndefense  implicating  the  Voting  Rights  Act  also  generates  three-judge  court \njurisdiction.”). The Third Circuit sidestepped the issue: “Due to the substantial \nlikelihood that this matter is beyond the purview of § 2284, Circuit Judge Philips, \ndesignated  as  a  member  of  the  statutory  three-judge  court,  has  also  been \ndesignated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 291(b) [] to sit in the alternative as a district \njudge with other members of this court, with the court constituting in that mode \na regular district court consisting of a panel of three district judges.”). See also S. \nREP. 94-204, at 1994 (suggesting this alternative). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 9 of 50\nthat  Congress  made  a  deliberate  choice  to  distinguish  between  constitutional \napportionment challenges and challenges brought under § 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct [as to the scope of§ 2284(a)]”). Consequently, the Court should dismiss the \namended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. If the Court denies \nthis part of this motion, Sen. McClendon respectfully asks the Court to certify the \nquestion for interlocutory appeal under 26 U.S.C. § 1292(b). This issue meets the \nEleventh Circuit’s requirements for such interlocutory appeal: (1) the issue is a \npure question of law, (2) and controls at least a substantial part of the case, (3) \nthe issue would be specified by the district court in its order (if the Court agrees \nwith this request), (4) there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion on \nthe issue, and (5) resolution of the issue would reduce the amount of litigation \nnecessary on remand. See McFarlin v. Conseco Services, LLC, 381 F.3d 1251, \n1264  (11th  Cir.  2004)(specifying  five  requirements  for  granting  interlocutory \nappeal under § 2292(b)); see also Johnson, Ex. A, doc. 16-1, p. 5-6. Further, if the \nCourt were to certify this issue for interlocutory appeal, Sen. McClendon would \nrequest the Court to enter an order staying proceedings before this Court pending \nthe interlocutory appeal.  \n    \nTHE AMENDED COMPLAINT FAILS TO DEMONSTRATE  \nTHE EXISTENCE OF A PROPER REMEDY  \nAND SO IT FAILS TO ESTABLISH THAT PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING   \n \n  The  “irreducible  constitutional  minimum  of  standing”  has  three \ncomponents: an injury in fact, a causal connection between the injury and the \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 10 of 50\nconduct complained of, and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  \n“The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these \nelements,”  which  “are  not  mere  pleading  requirements  but  rather  an \nindispensable part of the plaintiff[s’] case ....” Id. In other words, a plaintiff’s \nfailure to establish an injury means that plaintiff lacks standing, which in turn \nmeans the plaintiff’s case must be dismissed.  \n  The initial test of a claim for vote dilution under § 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct  is  its  ability  to  cross  the  threshold  laid  down  by  the  Supreme  Court  in \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986):  \nFirst,  the  minority  group  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  it  is \nsufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority \nin a single-member district. [] Second, the minority group must be \nable to show that it is politically cohesive. [] Third, the minority must \nbe able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a \nbloc to enable it—in the absence of special circumstances, such as the \nminority  candidate  running  unopposed,  []  —usually  to  defeat  the \nminority’s preferred candidate. \n \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51 (footnote and citations omitted). The first of these \nrequirements  has  particular  importance.  “The  reason  that  a  minority  group \nmaking such a challenge must show, as a threshold matter, that it is sufficiently \nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member \ndistrict  is  this:  Unless  minority  voters  possess  the  potential  to  elect \nrepresentatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 11 of 50\nclaim  to  have  been  injured  by  that  structure  or  practice.”  Id.  at  52  n.17 \n(underlining added).  \n  Mindful of Gingles’ threshold requirement, Chestnut has alleged that “[t]he \nAfrican-American  population  in  Alabama  is  sufficiently  numerous  and \ngeographically compact to form a majority of eligible voters – meaning a majority \nof  the  voting  age  population  -  in  two  congressional  districts.”  Doc.  14,  ¶  6 \n(footnote omitted), see also id. ¶ 105 (same allegation). However, she pleaded no \nfacts to support this conclusory allegation.  \n  The  modern  standard  for  pleading  a  cause  of  action,  set  forth  by  the \nSupreme Court in  Bell Atlantic  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)  and \nAshcroft  v.  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  662  (2009),  is  not  onerous,  and  can  be  satisfied \nsimply by alleging sufficient facts to show that a claim is more than speculative. \nAs summarized by the Eleventh Circuit:  \nTo  survive  dismissal  for  failure  to  state  a  claim,  the  “factual \nallegations in the complaint, accepted as true, must be sufficient to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). In other words, a complaint \nmust contain sufficient factual matter to \"state a claim to relief that \nis  plausible  on  its  face.\"  Id.  at  570.  The  well-pled  facts  in  the \ncomplaint must be sufficient to \"permit the court to infer more than \nthe mere possibility of misconduct.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n679 (2009). \n \nA  complaint  that  offers  \"labels  and  conclusions,\"  a  \"formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action,\" or \"naked assertions \ndevoid  of  further  factual  enhancement\"  will  not  be  sufficient  to \nwithstand a motion to dismiss. (internal quotation marks omitted; \nalteration  adopted).  Likewise,  we  have  stated  that  \"conclusory \nallegations, unwarranted deductions of facts[,] or legal conclusions \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 12 of 50\nmasquerading  as  facts  will  not  prevent  dismissal.\"  Oxford  Asset \nMgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).  \n \nLopez v. United States, 2016 WL 3771824 *5 (11th Cir. July 15, 2016) (parallel \ncitations omitted); see also, e.g., Mallory v. Biomet, 2014 WL 6890740 *5 (M.D. \nAla. Dec. 4, 2014)(same). As further summarized by this Court, “Pleadings that \ncontain nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction do not meet Rule 8 standards.” Teitel v. Capell Howard, P.C., 2018 WL \n525296, *3 (N.D. Ala. 2018)(internal quotation marks removed). \n  Chestnut’s  amended  complaint  does  not  meet  this  pleading  standard. \nMerely  asserting  in  ¶¶  6  and  105  that  the  “African-American  population  in \nAlabama is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority \nof eligible voters … in two congressional districts” is an example of the sort of \n“formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action” and “naked assertion[] \ndevoid  of  further  factual  enhancement”  that  is  “not  sufficient  to  withstand  a \nmotion to dismiss.” Broward Citizens for Fair Districts v. Broward County, 2012 \nWL 1110053, *4-*5 (N.D. Fla. 2012)(granting motion to dismiss where plaintiffs \nalleged  without  necessary  factual  support  that  the  “voting  electorate  ...  in \nCommission Districts 1 and 7 .. have become sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority of those districts”, and saying “Merely reciting \nthe elements of a cause of action, as the Plaintiffs have done, does not meet this \nstandard.”). Rather than the conclusory allegations pleaded in ¶¶ 6 and 105 of the \namended complaint, Twombly and Iqbal, and  the Eleventh Circuit’s and this \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 13 of 50\nCourt’s cases construing them require Chestnut to have pleaded enough facts to \nmove her complaint across the line from speculative to “plausible on its face.” \n  To be specific, to meet the first Gingles requirement, which Chestnut had \nto do to establish an injury, and thus standing, Chestnut was required to include \nin her pleading a map5 showing that Gingles’ first requirement could, as a matter \nof fact, have been drawn by Alabama. Wright v. Sumter County Bd. of Elections \nand Registrations, 2014 WL 1347427, *2 (M.D. Ga. 2014) (denying motion for \npreliminary  injunction,  and  saying:  “Wright  did  not  satisfy  the  first  Gingles \nfactor. The Eleventh Circuit has ‘repeatedly construed the first Gingles factor as \nrequiring a plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a proper remedy.’ … Beyond \nhis request that the Court ‘order districts for the Sumter County, Georgia School \nBoard to have nine districts only,’ which the Court cannot command, Wright did \nnot propose or identify any scheme or district division—a benchmark—that would \nprovide  black  voters  better  access  to  the  political  process.  ‘[A]  court  cannot \ndetermine  whether  the  voting  strength  of  a  minority  has  been  impermissibly \ndiluted  without  having  some  alternative  electoral  structure  in  mind  for \ncomparison.’ ... Wright’s failure to identify an alternative scheme is fatal to his \n                                                 \n5   Sen. McClendon does not foreclose the possibility of establishing Gingles’ \nfirst requirement without a map – for example, Chestnut could designate all of \nthe census blocks that would be included in a Gingles-compliant district, but that \nwould be a very cumbersome thing to do. As a practical matter, a map, with the \nusual accompanying population reports, is the practical and obvious way to show \ncompliance with Gingles, particularly given that at some point in the litigation \nChestnut will have to produce an actual map, and it is difficult to believe that \nChestnut commenced this expensive litigation without reason for believing that \nshe could meet Gingles’ first requirement.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 14 of 50\ndilution  claim.”)(underlining  added;  citations  omitted);  Broward  Citizens  for \nFair  Districts  v.

Fla. \n2012)(granting motion to dismiss and saying: “In its Reply, Broward County also \npoints out that Plaintiffs have failed to present alternative maps to the Court or \n‘offer any information about how they would create majority Black districts.’ … \nThe  Court  agrees  that  this  represents  an  additional  pleading  deficiency  in \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint. The Eleventh Circuit has ‘repeatedly construed \nthe first Gingles factor as requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a \nproper remedy.’ …. Plaintiffs mere allegation that ‘[s]everal alternate maps were \npresented  to  the  County  Commission  which  would  potentially  achieve  the \nobjectives  of  the  County’s  redistricting  mandate  without  violating  the \nconstitutional  rights  of  the  Black  and  other  minority  voting  population’  is \nconclusory and insufficient to meet Plaintiffs’ pleading burden. See Iqbal, 129 \nS.Ct. at 1950 (‘Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-\ntechnical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of \ndiscovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.’).”); see also \nNipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1530-31 (11th Cir 1994) (“The rationale of the \nGingles decision demonstrates that, if a plaintiff’s section 2 claim alleges vote \ndilution, then the plaintiff must meet Gingles’ threshold criteria regardless of the \nnature of the office at stake. … The first Gingles precondition, informed by the \nsecond, dictates that the issue of remedy is part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case \nin  section  2  vote  dilution  cases.  As  the  Supreme  Court  has  explained,  “[t]he \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 15 of 50\n‘geographically compact [minority]’ and ‘minority political cohesion’ showings [in \nthe Gingles threshold test]  are needed to establish  that  the minority has the \npotential to elect a representative of its own choice from some single-member \ndistrict.” ….

Thus, if a minority \ncannot  establish  that  an  alternate  election  scheme  exists  that  would  provide \nbetter access to the political process, then the challenged voting practice is not \nresponsible  for  the  claimed  injury.”);  Johnson  v.  DeSoto  County  Board  of \nCommissioners,  204  F.3d  1335,  1343  (11th  Cir.  2000)  (“On  this  record,  the \ndistrict court (considering all the evidence including the 1990 census) did not \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 16 of 50\nclearly err in finding and in concluding that Plaintiffs failed to show the existence \nof the black-majority district needed to establish their prima facie case of vote \ndilution.”). \n  Chestnut’s failure to establish an injury is curious, given that the relevant \ndata have been available since the 2010 Census was released February 2011 and it \nis fair to assume that before commencing this lawsuit Chestnut sought factual \nconfirmation  that  Alabama’s  black  voting-age  population  (BVAP)  population \nwere “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a \n[second] single-member district”. Nevertheless, Chestnut’s failure to show in her \ncomplaint that the first Gingles prerequisite could be satisfied means that she \nlacks standing. Therefore the amended complaint should be dismissed. In the \nalternative,  because  this  issue  also  meets  McFarlin’s  five  requirements  for \ninterlocutory appeal, Sen. McClendon respectfully requests the Court to certify \nthis issue for interlocutory appeal if the Court declines to dismiss, and to stay \nproceedings before this Court while the interlocutory appeal is pending.   \nCHESTNUT’S AMENDED COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED  \nBECAUSE HER DELAY IN BRINGING IT WAS INEXCUSABLE AND PREJUDICIAL  \n \n  The 2010 Census result for the State of Alabama was released in February \n2011. Those data contained all of the information that Chestnut needed or could \nhave used to bring the claim that instead she waited over seven years to bring in \nJune  2018.  In  the  intervening  years,  there  have  been  four  Congressional \nelections: 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 (pending). And while the census results \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 17 of 50\nhave not changed, their accuracy has, because of demographic changes over the \npast eight years since the 2010 Census. What’s more, we now are on the threshold \nof the  2020  Census, which when  released in  2021 will  be  used to  draw new \ncongressional districts for Alabama. In February 2021, the State of Alabama will \nreceive the Alabama results from the 2020 Census and will start redistricting. At \nthat time, the Legislature already will be in session, and will need to complete \nredistricting  before  it  recesses  in  May  (if  not  earlier)  so  that  candidates  for \nCongress and the Legislature can start campaigning in new districts for the 2022 \nelection.  If  this  case  takes  half  as  long  as  the  recent  5-year  long  legislative \nredistricting case6, then it will be concluded at about the time the Legislature \ntakes  up  redistricting.  And  although  plaintiff’s  counsel  will  argue  that \ncongressional redistricting is not as complicated as legislative redistricting, and \nwill insist that this case can get to a final decision in fewer than 2.5 years, they \n                                                 \n6  Redistricting cases are not simple and they are not quickly resolved; they \n  \nalmost always involve at least one appeal, and often a remand that the trial court \nmust  act  upon.  For  example,  Abbott  v.  Perez,  the  challenge  to  Texas’ \ncongressional and legislative districts mentioned above, was commended before a \nthree-judge court in 2011, just after the challenged plans we enacted, and no final \norder is yet in sight. By this measure, the last redistricting challenge in Alabama, \nwhich consolidated separate claims brought by the Alabama Legislative Black \nCaucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference, was a model of judicial speed \nand took only five years to complete, running from October 10, 2012 (when a stay \nwas lifted after the new legislative plans were precleared by Attorney General \nHolder)  until  October  23,  2017  (when  final  judgment  approving  the  State’s \nremedial  legislative  districts  was  entered).  See  Alabama  Legislative  Black \nCaucus v. State of Alabama, No. 2:12-cv-691-WKW-MHT-WHP (docket sheet). \nThe case included a trial, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1227 (M.D. Ala. 2013), an appeal and \noral argument to the Supreme Court, 135 S.Ct 1257 (2015), a remand, 231 F. \nSupp. 2d 1026 (2017), and passage of remedial districts by the Legislature.\n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 18 of 50\nalso are insisting that this case not follow the most expeditious route to a final \ndecision, i.e., trial before a three judge court and direct appeal to the Supreme \nCourt, instead of trial before a single judge with an appeal to the Eleventh Circuit \nand review by writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court. \n  To apply laches against Chestnut requires a showing that she delayed in \nbringing her vote dilution claim, that her delay was inexcusable, and that her \ninexcusable delay unduly prejudiced Secretary Merrill and Sen. McClendon – or \nmore broadly and accurately, the State of Alabama. In re Woide, 730 Fed.Appx. \n731, *736 (11th Cir. April 5, 2018); E.E.O.C. v. Dressler Industries, Inc., 668 F2d \n1199, 1202 (11th Cir. 1982) (“To apply laches in a particular case, the court must \nfind both that the plaintiff delayed inexcusably in bringing the suit and that this \ndelay unduly prejudiced defendants.”). These elements are easily established.  \n  First,  Chestnut’s  claim  became  available  to  her  in  June  2011  when \nAlabama’s new congressional districts were enacted with only one majority-black \ndistrict, despite the fact that the 2010 Census established – she alleges – that two \nmajority-black districts could have been drawn, and that, she alleges, the Voting \nRights Act required drawing two majority-black districts. Instead of challenging \nthe new congressional districts, she waited seven years to bring the very same \nchallenge she could have brought in 2011. Chestnut unquestionably delayed.  \n  Two, Chestnut’s delay was clearly inexcusable. The information on which \nher claim necessarily is based – the 2010 Census results - became available in \nFebruary 2011. Since then there has been no change in those data, or in other \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 19 of 50\nrelevant facts, or in the law that was necessary for her to bring her lawsuit. There \nwas no impediment to her bringing a § 2 vote dilution claim in 2011.7 \n  Three,  the  State  of  Alabama  would  be  unduly  prejudiced  by  allowing \nChestnut’s claim to proceed. Assuming Chestnut were to prevail, and that a final \ndecision could be reached in 2019 or 2020 (an unlikely assumption, see supra \nn.7), new districts would be drawn on the basis of the 2010 Census, which would \nbe at least nine of ten years out-of-date. It unduly prejudice the State, office \nholders, candidates, and voters to require the drawing of new districts using data \nno one pretends portrays accurately the State’s present demographics. Also, the \nCensus  Bureau  estimates  broad  variances  in  how  populations  of  Alabama \ncounties  have  changed  since  2010.  According  to  the  Bureau’s  most  recent \nestimates, Mobile County’s population has barely changed (+.2%)8, neighboring \nBaldwin County’s has increased by 16.7 %, Lee County’s increased by 15.2%, and \nConecuh County’s decreased by 5.2%, and all of these counties would likely be \nincluded in or impacted by Chestnut’s efforts to draw a second majority-black \ncongressional  district.  As this example shows, using  outdated Census  data  to \n                                                 \n7    Chestnut may respond that she could not have commenced this claim until \nshe moved to Congressional District 1. The amended complaint alleges she did \nthat in 2016, doc. 14, ¶ 13, but it does not say where she lived before then, and it \ndoes not address where the other nine plaintiffs live or have lived. But even in the \nunlikely event that from 2011 until just recently no plaintiff lived in a location \nthat plaintiffs claim would be a basis for standing to sue, the real party in interest \nin this case is a political entity that - this case itself shows - is able to recruit \nplaintiffs at will. See supra n. 4. There is no reason why this case could not have \nbeen brought in 2011.  \n8    These  2018  Census  Bureau  as  from  U.S.  Bureau  QuickFacts:  Alabama, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/al (last visited August 26, 2018). \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 20 of 50\ndraw new districts would violate one-person, one-vote and lay the basis for a \nseparate counter-lawsuit under the Equal Protection Clause.   \nIn  addition,  Alabamians  would  be  prejudiced  if  the  Legislature  were \nrequired to spend time and resources with redistricting, taking attention away \nfrom other important Legislative activities, only months before the Legislature \nmust take up that task again after the 2020 Census. It would be senseless to do as \nChestnut asks,  and  require the Legislature to redistrict  twice in  such a short \nperiod of time. Following this reasoning, the court in MacGovern v. Connolly, \nrefused to order a redistricting where plaintiffs inexcusably delayed until the last \nmoment their challenge to Massachusetts legislative district:  \nEquity demands that a federal court stay its hand when judicial relief \nmakes  no  sense.  This  action,  in  which  the  remedy  sought  would \ncome at great cost and yield results that are at best uncertain, and at \nworst, perverse, is plainly such a case. When the massive disruption \nto the political process of the Commonwealth is weighed against the \nharm to plaintiffs of suffering through one more election based on an \nallegedly invalid redistricting scheme, equity requires that we deny \nrelief.  \n \nId., 637 F. Supp. 111, 116 (D. Mass. 1986).  \nMoreover, Alabama is projected to lose a Congressional seat based on the \n202o Census. Were that to happen, the boundaries of new districts would vary \nsignificantly from any remedial districts. For this reason, a demonstration by \nChestnut of the possibility of drawing two majority-black districts with seven \ncongressional  seats  would  not  establish  a  precedent  that  two  majority-black \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 21 of 50\ndistricts could be drawn using 2020  Census data, or when there are only six \nCongressional districts. \nIn Fouts v. Harris, the Court found that very similar facts were unduly \nprejudicial to the State of Florida. Id.,  88 F.  Supp.  2d 1351 (S.D. Fla. 1999). \nPlaintiffs in Fouts brought a challenge to Florida’s congressional districts in 1998. \nThe State of Florida asserted laches: \nDefendants assert that they are prejudiced by the Plaintiff’s delay in \nbringing this action because (1) over the six years [since the then-\nexisting congressional districts went into effect] and three election \ncycles voters have come to know their districts and candidates, and \nwill  be  confused  by  change;  and  (2)  requiring  redistricting  now, \nbefore the 2000 census will result in two redistrictings within a two \nyear period, with resulting in voter confusion, instability, dislocation, \nand [a] financial and logistical burden on the state. \n \nId., 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354. Relying on a Fourth Circuit decision, the District \nCourt dismissed the case on the basis of laches: \nThe dangers of such frequent redistrictings were the basis for the \nWhite court’s decision to impose the defense of laches. The White \ncourt stated: \n[i]f we affirm the district court’s order, the Board will \nbe required to reapportion itself this year and it will \nprobably be required to do so again next year, when \nthe  results  of  the  1990  census  are  available.  We \nbelieve  that  two  reapportionments  within  a  short \nperiod  of  two  years  would  greatly  prejudice  the \nCounty and its citizens by creating instability and \ndislocation in the electoral system and by imposing \ngreat financial and logistical burdens. \nWhite, 909 F.2d at 104 (emphasis added). \n  \nMoreover, if the Court were to impose redistricting before the 2000 \ncensus, such redistricting would necessarily be based on 1990 census \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 22 of 50\nfigures.  Such  old  census  figures  have  been  recognized  as  unduly \nprejudicial because they fail to provide a basis for “fair and accurate \nrepresentation for the citizens.”  \n  \nTherefore,  the  defendants  have  established  each  of  the  three \nelements necessary to assert the defense of laches. Accordingly, the \nmotions to dismiss will be granted as to that issue. \n \nFouts, 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354-1355 (quoting and citing White v. Daniel, 909 F.2d \n99 (4th Cir. 1990))(emphasis added in Fouts).  \n  Fouts was cited approvingly by the Eleventh Circuit in another redistricting \ncase, Sanders v. Dooly County, Ga., 245 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir. 2001). The Sanders \ncomplaint attacked a joint county commission-board of education redistricting \nplan, but as in this case, the Sanders plaintiffs had waited until two years before \nthe next census to file their complaint. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed \nthe District Court’s dismissal for laches of plaintiff’s claims for injunctive relief: \nThe  district  court  granted  the  defendants  summary  judgment  on \nlaches grounds. According to the court, the plaintiffs’ waiting until \nNovember 1998 to file suit—over six years after the first use of the \nplan and five years after Shaw v. Reno issued—was an inexcusable \ndelay. This delay prejudiced the defendants and citizens of Dooly \nCounty, the court concluded, in two principal ways: (1) redistricting \nlate  in  the  decade  would  lead  to  back-to-back  redistrictings  (the \ncourt-ordered one and the one using new census data) that would \nconfuse voters and be unnecessarily costly to the County; and (2) the \ncensus data available to redistrict now are over ten years old and \nthus unreliable. The plaintiffs appeal. \n…. \n \nTurning to the merits, we conclude that the district court did not \nabuse its discretion in deeming the claims seeking injunctive relief to \nbe laches-barred for the reasons that we described above. Cf. Fouts \nv.  Harris,  88  F.  Supp.  2d  1351,  1353  (S.D.Fla.1999)  (relying  on \nsimilar  laches reasoning  to dismiss  Shaw  claims),  aff’d sub nom. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 23 of 50\nChandler v. Harris, 529 U.S. 1084, 120 S.Ct. 1716, 146 L.Ed.2d 639 \n(2000). \n \nSanders, 245 F.3d at 1290-1291.  \n \n  However,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  reached  a  different  conclusion  on  the \nplaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief: \nBut we do think that the district court overstepped its discretion in \njudging  the  claims  for  declaratory  relief  to  be  similarly  barred, \nbecause  the  third  element  of  a  laches  defense—prejudice  to  the \ndefendants  from the unexcused delay—is missing.  … None  of the \ngrounds for prejudice that the district court relied on applies to the \nplaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the 1992 plan violates the \nEqual  Protection  Clause.  There  is  no  risk  of  confusion  from  a \nredistricting, obviously; no burden to the county to redistrict; and no \nuse  of  out-of-date  census  data.  An  effect  of  a  grant  of  such \ndeclaratory  relief  could  be  to  prevent  the  Attorney  General  from \nusing the 1993 consent-decree plan as a baseline for retrogression \nanalysis in the post–2000 census round of preclearance proceedings \nunder  §  5  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  but  that  effect  is  no  more \nprejudicial to the defendants now than it would have been in 1993. \n \nId.,  245  F.3d  at  1291-2192  (footnotes  omitted).  This  part  of  Sanders  is \ndistinguishable.  The  specific  benefit  to  plaintiffs  that  the  Eleventh  Circuit \nidentified – resetting the benchmark for purposes of Section 5 review – is of no \nuse to Chestnut. And whether two majority-black districts could have been drawn \nin 2011 is speculative as to whether two such districts will be drawable after the \n2020 Census, particularly if Alabama loses a seat in Congress, leaving the state \nwith only six Representatives. \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 24 of 50\n  Chestnut waited too late to bring her suit, and the defendants and State of \nAlabama  would  be  unduly  prejudiced  if  the  Court  were  to  overlook  her \ninexcusable delay and allow her case to go forward.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  shown  above,  Sen.  McClendon  respectfully  moves  the \nCourt to: \na.  dismiss  the  amended  complaint  for  lack  of  subject-matter \njurisdiction, or in the alternative certify for interlocutory appeal the \nissue of whether Chestnut’s § 2 challenge to the State’s congressional \ndistricts must be heard by a three-judge court, and stay proceedings \nbefore this Court while the interlocutory appeal is pending; \n \nb. dismiss the amended complaint because Chestnut failed to state a \nclaim of vote dilution, or in the alternative certify for interlocutory \nappeal  the  issue  of  whether  Chestnut  must  satisfy  Gingles’  first \nthreshold requirement in her complaint, and stay proceedings before \nthis Court while the interlocutory appeal is pending,  and \n \nc.  dismiss  the  amended  complaint  because  Chestnut  inexcusably \ndelayed in commencing this case, and allowing it to proceed would \nunduly prejudice defendants, the State of Alabama, members of the \nLegislature, candidates, and voters. \n \n Respectfully submitted this the 27th day of August, 2018. \n \n/s/Dorman Walker   \nCounsel for Intervenor \n   \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 19-1   Filed 08/27/18   Page 25 of 50\n \nOF COUNSEL:   \n \nDorman Walker (ASB-9154-R81J)   \ndwalker@balch.com \nBALCH & BINGHAM LLP \nPost Office Box 78 \nMontgomery, AL 36101-0078 \nTelephone: (334) 834-6500 \nFacsimile: (334) 269-3115 \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI certify that on August 27, 2018, I electronically filed the foregoing with \nthe Clerk of the Court using the CM/ECF system which will send a copy to the \nfollowing: \nAria C.

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \nLAKEISHA CHESTNUT, et al.,  ) \n  ) \n  Plaintiffs,  ) \n    ) \n  v.  )  Case No. 2:18-CV-907-KOB \n    )   \nJOHN H. MERRILL, in his official  ) \nCapacity as Alabama Secretary of State  ) \n    ) \n  Defendant.  ) \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \n  This matter comes before the court on Alabama Senator Jim McClendon’s “Motion to \nIntervene.” (Doc. 19). On September 10, this court ordered Plaintiffs to show cause why Senator \nMcClendon should not be allowed to intervene as a defendant. On September 10, Defendant \nJohn Merrill filed “Defendant Secretary of State John Merrill’s Response to Senator Jim \nMcClendon’s Motion to Intervene (Doc. 19).” (Doc. 22). Later that same day, Plaintiffs filed \n“Plaintiffs’ Response to Order to Show Cause and Brief in Opposition to Senator Jim \nMcClendon’s Motion to Intervene.” (Doc. 23). The motion is now ripe for review. \n  Plaintiffs contend that Alabama Act No. 2011-518, now codified at Alabama Code § 17-\n14-70, caused a discriminatory effect in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 \nU.S.C. § 10301. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the redistricting of Congressional Districts 1, \n2, 3, and 7 diluted the African-American vote. Senator McClendon was a member of the \nAlabama House of Representatives and the House Chair of the Legislature’s Permanent \nCommittee on Reapportionment when the legislature drew the “2010 McClendon Congressional \nDistricts 1” plan, which later became Alabama Code § 17-14-70. Mr. McClendon seeks to \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 24   Filed 10/16/18   Page 2 of 5\nintervene in his official capacity as Alabama Senator and member of Alabama Legislature’s \nPermanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment. \nRule 24(b)(1)(B) \n  Senator McClendon seeks to intervene under Rule 24(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. Rule 24(b)(1)(B) permits intervention by anyone who “has a claim or defense \nthat shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.” Senator McClendon \ncontends that, as the author of the plan at issue, he is “particularly well informed to contribute to \nthe defense of the State’s congressional redistricting plan.” (Doc. 19 at 4). While the court does \nnot doubt Senator McClendon’s knowledge of the plan, he has no claim nor defense in this \naction.  \n  Senator McClendon argues that his assistance would be necessary should the court order \nthe state to redraw its congressional districts. To begin, such a remedy has not been ordered and \nmight never be ordered. To argue that Senator McClendon’s participation in this case is \nnecessary because of a potential remedy is highly speculative. More importantly, future \nparticipation in remedial redistricting is neither a claim nor a defense under Rule 24(b)(1)(B). \n  Senator McClendon also maintains that his help is necessary to protect the interests of the \nReapportionment Committee and the legislature. But he fails to acknowledge the procedure \ncreated by the State of Alabama to protect such interests. Alabama Code § 36-15-21 provides \nthat the state Attorney General controls “[a]ll litigation concerning the interest of the state, or any \ndepartment of the state.” Ala. Code § 36-15-21 (2018).  \n  A proposed intervenor’s interest is presumed adequately represented “when an existing \nparty pursues the same ultimate objective as the party seeking intervention.” United States v. \nGeorgia, 19 F.3d 1388, 1394 (11th Cir. 1994) (quoting FSLIC v. Falls Chase Special Taxing \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 24   Filed 10/16/18   Page 3 of 5\nDist., 893 F.2d 211, 215 (11th Cir. 1993)). The state Attorney General and Senator McClendon \nseek an identical outcome—to see the plan upheld as constitutional. Senator McClendon raises \nno argument why the state Attorney General’s representation would be inadequate. See One Wis. \nInst., Inc. v. Nichol, 310 F.R.D. 394, 397 (W.D. Wis. 2015) (“[T]he attorney general is \nadequately pursuing the outcome that the proposed intervenors seeks. The court is satisfied that \nthe existing parties are capable of identifying and presenting the relevant issues in this case.”).  \n  Because the state’s interest is adequately protected by the Attorney General, Senator \nMcClendon’s help is not needed to protect the interests of the legislature and the \nReapportionment Committee. \n  Senator McClendon has failed to demonstrate why he has a claim or defense in this case \nnot already adequately represented by the Attorney General, and so the court must deny his \nmotion for intervention under Rule 24(b)(1)(B) \nRule 24(b)(2) \n  Senator McClendon alternatively seeks to intervene under Rule 24(b)(2). Under \nRule 24(b)(2), the court may allow “a federal or state governmental officer or agency to \nintervene if a party’s claim or defense is based on: (A) a statute or executive order administered \nby the officer or agency; or (B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made \nunder the statute or executive order.” Senator McClendon contends that because the Alabama \nLegislature is responsible for drawing congressional districts and defending the Reapportionment \nCommittee’s Guidelines, he should be allowed to intervene. Plaintiffs maintain that Senator \nMcClendon is not a state officer administering a statute under Rule 24(b)(2). Instead, they \ncorrectly argue, the legislature merely promulgates law, but does not enforce or administer the \nlaw. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 24   Filed 10/16/18   Page 4 of 5\n  The courts have long recognized that state legislators in their official capacities “have no \nlegal interest in the implementation of the laws they pass.”  Gustafson v. Johns, No. 05-0352-\nCG-L, 2005 WL 8158752, at *1 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 30, 2006) (citing Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 \nF.2d 1197, 1205 (11th Cir. 1989)). Rather, “[l]egislators are not charged with enforcing or \nimplementing voting districts.” Id. (citing Scott v. Taylor, 405 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir. 2005)). \n“Clearly, a legislative body promulgates, debates, and passes laws; however, it is not even \narguable that the legislature administers or enforces those laws.” General Synod of the United \nChurch of Christ v. Resinger, No. 3:14-cv-00213-MOC-DLH, 2014 WL 5094093, at *3 \n(W.D.N.C. Oct. 10, 2014). Under Alabama law, the Secretary of State is the proper state entity to \nadminister the congressional district plan and state election laws. See Ala. Code § 17-1-3(a) \n(2018). So, Senator McClendon is not a state officer administering a statute.  \n  Senator McClendon further argues that defending the Reapportionment Committee’s \nGuidelines and drawing congressional districts are “requirement[s] . . . issued or made under the \nstatute or executive order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(2)(B). Alabama Code § 29-2-52 enumerates the \nvarious duties of the Committee on Reapportionment, but nowhere indicates a duty to defend or \nuphold the constitutionality of the guidelines or congressional districting plan. Because \ndefending the Reapportionment Committee’s Guidelines was not a requirement issued or made \nunder statute, this argument fails.  \n  While the statute does require the committee to develop plans for reapportionment, see \nAla. Code § 29-2-52(a)–(d), Senator McClendon misrepresents Plaintiffs’ claim. Plaintiffs do not \nclaim that the legislature intentionally promulgated a racially discriminatory reapportionment \nplan. Such a claim would challenge a requirement under the statute, such as the intent of the \nReapportionment Committee. Instead, Plaintiffs claim that the plan had a discriminatory effect. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 24   Filed 10/16/18   Page 5 of 5\nAn “effects” claim requires no showing of discriminatory intent by the legislature. See Abbott v. \nPerez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2330–31 (2018). Because Plaintiffs are not challenging intent of the \nReapportionment Committee or legislature, no defense is necessary based on a requirement \nunder Alabama Code § 29-2-52. \n  Because Senator McClendon failed to demonstrate that either of the government officer \nor agency rule subsections apply to him, therefore, the court must deny his motion to intervene \nunder Rule 24(b)(2). \n  For the reasons stated above, the court DENIES Senator McClendon’s motion to \nintervene. \nDONE and ORDERED this 16th day of October, 2018.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nKARON OWEN BOWDRE \nCHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n5 \n ",

Defendant first raises jurisdiction—specifically whether this court must \nrefer this case to a three-judge panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). The court always must \ndetermine whether it has jurisdiction before proceeding in any case. So, while Defendant raised \nseveral issues in his motion, the court will only address in this Memorandum Opinion whether it \nlacks jurisdiction and must refer this case to a three-judge panel. \n  Under § 2284, as relevant here, a three-judge panel must hear a case if the case either (1) \nraises a constitutional challenge to an apportionment of congressional districts or (2) is \n“otherwise required by Act of Congress” to be heard by a panel. Plaintiffs allege that the \nAlabama congressional redistricting plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \n§ 10301, but do not allege a constitutional violation. Section 2 does not require challenges \nbrought under its authority to be heard by a three-judge panel. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 2 of 10\n  Defendant first raised this jurisdictional question in his “Notice of Jurisdictional Issue” \non July 9, 2018.1 (Doc. 12). On November 2, 2018, Defendant filed his “Motion for Judgment on \nthe Pleadings” in which he contends that this court lacks jurisdiction because a three-judge panel \nmust hear this case. (Doc. 27). Plaintiffs filed “Plaintiffs’ Brief in Opposition to Defendant’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings” on November 30, 2018. (Doc. 31). On December 21, \n2018, Defendant filed “Secretary of State John Merrill’s Reply in Support of His Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings (Doc. 27).” (Doc. 37). On January 16, 2019, this court held a motion \nhearing on the issue of whether a three-judge panel must hear this case. (Doc. 35). The \njurisdictional issue is now ripe for review. \nI.  Background \n  Plaintiffs are eight African-American citizens of Alabama. One Plaintiff resides in \nCongressional District (CD) 1, one resides in CD 2, one resides in CD 3, and five reside in CD 7. \nThe redistricting plan currently used in Alabama, Senate Bill 484, allegedly “packs” African-\nAmerican voters into CD 7. See S.B. 484, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011). The Alabama legislature \nestablished CD 7 as a majority-minority district following the 1982 Amendments of the Voting \nRights Act. Nearly one-third of Alabama’s African-American population falls into CD 7. Prior to \nthe passage of S.B. 484, the black voting age population (BVAP) of CD 7 was 58.33%. Now, the \nCD 7 BVAP is 60.91%. Plaintiffs argue that S.B. 484 moved African-American voters from \npredominantly white districts into CD 7 to “pack” the district designated as a majority-minority \n                                                           \n1 Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a “notice” as an appropriate \nmotion of pleading or filing, and Defendant’s “notice” did not ask the court to take any action, \nthe court did evaluate its jurisdiction without formally addressing the issue in writing. Because \nPlaintiffs did not assert a constitutional claim, the undersigned determined that the statutory \nclaim did not trigger a three-judge court under § 2284. By contrast, Defendant’s motion for \njudgment on the pleadings does ask the court to openly address the jurisdictional question, so the \ncourt now reviews its jurisdiction for a second time in this Memorandum Opinion. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 3 of 10\ndistrict with African-American voters. The plan also allegedly “cracks” African-American voters \nin CDs 1, 2, and 3 by splitting among three districts those African-American voters who could be \ngrouped together in a second majority-minority district. Plaintiffs contend that the African-\nAmerican population in these districts could be united to form a second majority-minority CD. \n  Plaintiffs only raise a Section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act, alleging vote dilution. \nThey do not raise a constitutional challenge to the redistricting plan. \n  Defendant requests a three-judge panel under 28 U.S.C. § 2284. Defendant concedes that \nthis case does not fall within the express language of § 2284’s requirements for a three-judge \npanel. But Defendant argues that Plaintiffs selectively brought only a statutory claim precisely to \navoid a three-judge panel, and, because the statutory claim is so similar to the corresponding \nconstitutional claim Plaintiffs deliberately omitted, a three-judge panel should still hear the case. \nFurther, Defendant maintains that the legislative history behind the 1976 amendments to § 2284 \nand the policies behind § 2284 coupled with the Voting Rights Act lean in favor of convening a \nthree-judge panel to hear this case. \n  Plaintiffs contend that this case should not go to a three-judge panel because § 2284(a) \nplainly states that a three-judge panel shall only be convened when challenging the \nconstitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or “when otherwise required by \nAct of Congress.” Plaintiffs maintain that “the plaintiff [is] the master of the claim,” so the court \nshould honor their decision not to bring a constitutional challenge. See Beneficial Nat’l Bank v. \nAnderson, 539 U.S. 1, 12 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 \nU.S. 386, 392 (1987)). Further, Plaintiffs argue that Section 2 does not require a three-judge \npanel, so Section 2 cannot be considered an Act of Congress “otherwise” requiring a three-judge \npanel to hear the case. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 4 of 10\nII. Standard of Review \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3) states that “[i]f the court determines at any time \nthat it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.” Indeed, “it is \nincumbent upon [a] federal court[] . . . to constantly examine the basis of jurisdiction, doing so \non [its] own motion if necessary.” Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, 639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir. \n1981) (citing Rule 12(h)(3)); see also Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152 \n(1908) (“[I]t is the duty of this court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the circuit court, which is \ndefined and limited by statute, is not exceeded.”). \nIII. Discussion \n  Here, the parties do not contest whether a federal court may hear this case, but whether a \nthree-judge panel must hear this case. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a), “a district court of three \njudges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed \nchallenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the \napportionment of any statewide legislative body.” If the court determines that the case must be \nheard by a three-judge panel, “the judge to whom the request is presented shall . . . immediately \nnotify the chief judge of the circuit.” Id. § 2284(b)(1). If a three-judge panel is convened, a single \njudge may not enter a judgment on the merits. Id. § 2284(b)(3). So, this court must determine the \njurisdictional question of whether this case is properly before a single judge before the case can \ncontinue. \n  On its face, Plaintiffs’ complaint only brings an action under Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act—not under the 14th or 15th Amendments, which often accompany Section 2 causes \nof action; not under any other constitutional provision; and not under any act of Congress that \n“otherwise require[s]” a three-judge court. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 5 of 10\n  A claim solely alleging a Section 2 violation falls outside a plain reading of § 2284. Such \na claim is neither a constitutional challenge nor “when otherwise required by Act of Congress.” \nA few provisions in the Voting Rights Act require a three-judge panel to hear certain actions. See \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10303(a)(5), 10304(a) (2012) (requiring a three-judge \npanel to hear Section 4 challenges and Section 5 challenges). But no provision of the Voting \nRights Act requires a violation of Section 2 to go to a three-judge panel. So, Section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act cannot be considered “when otherwise required by Act of Congress” within \n§ 2284(a) to require a three-judge panel for this case. \n  The parties agree that a strict reading of the text of § 2284 excludes a Section 2 Voting \nRights Act challenge—without a corresponding constitutional challenge—from the requirement \nto be heard by a three-judge panel. \n  Defendant recognizes that Plaintiffs’ complaint only asserts a claim under Section 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act and not a constitutional violation. Defendant also recognizes that in 1976, \nwhen Congress amended § 2284, Congress made the amendments to limit the number of cases \nrequiring a three-judge panel. And Defendant recognizes that § 2284 plainly reads: “A district \ncourt of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an \naction is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of the congressional districts \nor the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.” \n  But Defendant wants this court to read beyond the plain text of the statute. Defendant \nwants this court to read into Section 2 a requirement that such a challenge must go to a three-\njudge panel, or to strike “constitutional” from the requirements to invoke a three-judge panel in \n§ 2284. The court sees no need to go beyond the text of Section 2 or § 2284 when their plain \nmeanings are so clear.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 6 of 10\n  As the Supreme Court noted long ago, “when words are free from doubt they must be \ntaken as the final expression of the legislative intent . . . . In other words, the language being \nplain, and not leading to absurd or wholly impracticable consequences, it is the sole evidence of \nthe ultimate legislative intent.” Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 490 (1917). Canons of \nconstruction cannot be used “to create ambiguity where the statute’s text and structure suggest \nnone.” Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). Here, the court can find no \nambiguity on the face of § 2284. Because the statute is unambiguous, the court sees no reason to \ngo beyond the text. \n  Even assuming the court had free rein to look beyond the text, Defendant’s arguments for \ndoing so fail. Defendant contends that the court should read into § 2284 congressional intent to \ninclude Section 2 challenges in addition to constitutional challenges to congressional and \nstatewide legislative apportionment plans as matters to be heard by a three-judge panel. To do so, \nDefendant relies on a Justice Scalia quote: “This canon [of reading a statute fairly] follows \ninevitably from the facts that (1) interpretation always depends on context, (2) context always \nincludes evident purpose, and (3) evident purpose always includes effectiveness.” Antonin Scalia \n& Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law 63 (2012).  \n  Defendant argues that “when Congress last amended § 2284(a), it had no idea that in the \nfuture there would be a statutory claim for vote dilution.” (Doc. 37 at 6). Defendant cites to a \nSenate Report from the 1976 amendments to § 2284 as evidence that Congress would have \nintended for Section 2 violations to be heard by a three-judge panel. (Id. at 4). The Senate Report \nexplains that “[t]he bill preserves three-judge courts for cases involving congressional \nreapportionment . . . because it is the judgment of the committee that these issues are of such \nimportance that they ought to be heard by a three-judge court.” S. Rep. No. 94-204, at 9 (1976). \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 7 of 10\nAnd, as noted by Defendant in the motion hearing, Congress designed the panel format “to lend \ngreater dignity to the proceedings.” See Michael E. Solimine, The Three-Judge District Court in \nVoting Rights Litigation, 30 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 79, 84 (1996). \n  The court recognizes Defendant’s point that, when Congress amended § 2284 in 1976, \nlitigators did not yet understand that congressional apportionment plans could be challenged \nunder Section 2, and so Congress did not know at that time that § 2284 could subsequently be \nused to prevent Section 2 challenges from being heard by three-judge panels. See Page v. \nBartels, 248 F.3d 175, 189 (3d Cir. 2001) (“[I]n 1976 . . . § 2 of the Voting Rights Act was not \navailable to litigants seeking to challenge apportionment. At that time, apportionment challenges \nwere generally constitutional in nature.”). Nevertheless, Congress could have so amended \nSection 2 had it desired to send those cases invoking it to a three-judge court. But currently, \n§ 2284 and Section 2—reading them together and separately—do not provide three-judge panels \nfor purely statutory Section 2 challenges. \n  Congress has reviewed both the statutes since the 1976 amendments of § 2284. In 1976, \nCongress amended § 2284 to read as it does today. Act of Aug. 12, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-381, 90 \nStat. 1119. And in 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act so that Section 2 reads as it \ndoes today. Act of June 29, 1982, Pub. L. 97-205, 96 Stat. 134. That amendment changed the \nnumbering of subsections and revised the declaratory judgment proceedings under Section 2, but \ndid not amend Section 2 to place cases brought solely under its authority within the “otherwise \nrequired by Act of Congress” provision in § 2284. In 1984, Congress amended § 2284 for a \nsecond time, but did not change subsection (a). Act of Nov. 9, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-620, sec. \n402, § 29(e), 98 Stat. 3335, 3359.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 8 of 10\n  When Congress amended Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, it could have \namended—but did not—the Voting Rights Act to add a provision directing all Section 2 \nchallenges to be heard by a three-judge panel. Even beyond 1982, Congress could have amended \nthe Voting Rights Act at any point between 1976 and the present to add such a provision. That is, \nCongress could amend the statute to send the case to a three-judge panel “as otherwise required \nby Act of Congress” pursuant to § 2284. \n  Perhaps Defendant forgot that Congress revisited both statutes since the 1976 \namendments to § 2284 and could have addressed the subsequent use of Section 2 of which—\naccording to Defendant—Congress “had no idea” in 1976. (Doc. 37 at 6). \n  The court must presume that Congress knows the laws it has enacted. See Cannon v. \nUniv. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 696–97 (1979) (“It is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives . . . know the law . . . .”). Indeed, congressional staffers are dedicated to \nresearching proposed and current legislation and the effects such legislation may have on other \nstatutes. The U.S. House of Representatives’ Office of Legislative Counsel must determine \n“[w]hat is the relation between the policy [to be legislated] and existing law” and “[m]ust \nexisting law be amended to avoid conflicts with the policy[.]” U.S. House of Representatives, \nApproaching a Problem, OFF. LEGIS. COUNS., http://legcounsel.house.gov/HOLC/\nBefore_Drafting/Approaching_a_Problem.html (last visited Jan. 16, 2019). Likewise, the \nSenate’s Office of Legislative Counsel makes similar determinations: “A new [legislative] \nmeasure must be carefully related to earlier enactments to produce, to the maximum extent \npracticable, a consistent body of law that will carry the congressional purpose into effect without \nproducing unintended consequences.” U.S. Senate, Responsibilities of the Legislative Drafter, \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 9 of 10\nOFF. LEGIS. COUNS., https://www.slc.senate.gov/Drafting/drafting.htm (last visited Jan. 16, \n2019). \n  The court cannot do Congress’s job. Article I firmly vests all legislative powers to \nCongress. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 1. “Congress is presumed to ‘know the law’ and has convened \nmany times since a particular statute was enacted or case decided. Because Congress has not \nseen fit to amend [the statute at issue] . . . it remains unchanged, reliable law.” Wiersum v. U.S. \nBank, N.A., 785 F.3d 483, 489 n.5 (11th Cir. 2015) (internal citation omitted). If Congress \nwanted to so amend § 2284 or Section 2, it could have. But Congress did not. \n  This court intends to remain firmly in its role to apply, not amend, the law. Several cases \nalleging only Section 2 violations have been heard by single judges. See Rural W. Tenn. African-\nAmerican Affairs Council v. Sundquist, 290 F.3d 835, 838 (6th Cir. 2000) (noting that the \nunderlying case initially alleged both Section 2 and constitutional violations, but “[b]ecause the \namended complaint contained no constitutional claims, the three-judge court disbanded”); see \nalso Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 336 F. Supp. 2d 976 (D.S.D. 2004); Old Person v. Brown, 182 F. \nSupp. 2d 1002 (D. Mont. 2002). Neither the court nor Defendant could find any purely Section 2 \ncases heard by a three-judge panel. So this court will apply the law before it and will not read \nnew provisions into—or strike existing words from—the statutes at issue. \n  As Justice Scalia wrote, “Context always matters. Let us not forget, however, why \ncontext matters: It is a tool for understanding the terms of the law, not an excuse for rewriting \nthem.” King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2497 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The court refuses to \nwrite into § 2284 or into Section 2 a provision requiring complaints alleging Section 2 violations \nto be heard by a three-judge panel—or alternatively striking “constitutional” from § 2284—so \nthat all apportionment challenges, statutory and constitutional, must be heard by a three-judge \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 40   Filed 01/28/19   Page 10 of 10\npanel. If Defendant believes that Congress has made an oversight in amending § 2284 or Section \n2—and perhaps requiring Section 2 challenges to be heard by a three-judge panel would make \nsense—he can raise that issue with the governmental branch charged with drafting and enacting \nthe law. This court adheres to the principle that “the proper role of the judiciary [is] to apply, not \namend, the work of the People’s representatives.” Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 137 \nS. Ct. 1718, 1726 (2017) (Gorsuch, J.).  \n  This court will apply the law as written. Because Plaintiffs’ complaint raises a challenge \nonly under Section 2, which is not a constitutional challenge to an apportionment plan or an act \nof Congress requiring a three-judge panel, the court cannot send this case to a three-judge panel. \nIV. Conclusion \n  For the reasons discussed above and at the hearing on January 16, 2019, the court will \nDENY Defendant’s motion for a judgment on the pleadings as to the jurisdictional issue. (Doc. \n27). This case will remain before this one judge, who will proceed with as much dignity as \npossible and as necessary given the nature of this case. The court will enter a separate Order \nconsistent with this Memorandum Opinion. Now that the court has expressed confidence in its \njurisdiction, the court will move on to separately rule on the remaining issues raised in \nDefendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. \nDONE and ORDERED this 28th day of January, 2019.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nKARON OWEN BOWDRE \nCHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n10 \n ",

In this motion, Defendant raised three grounds for judgment on the pleadings: (1) \njurisdiction lies with a three-judge court, (2) the complaint fails to demonstrate that a remedy \nexists, and (3) the claims are barred by the doctrine of laches. \n  On November 7, 2018, the court ordered the parties to brief all three issues raised in the \nmotion.

On December 21, 2018, \nDefendant filed “Secretary of State John Merrill’s Reply in Support of His Motion for Judgment \non the Pleadings (Doc. 27).” (Doc. 37).  \n  On January 16, 2019, the court held a hearing solely on the issue of whether jurisdiction \nof this case lay with this court or with a three-judge panel. On January 28, 2019, the court \nentered an Order denying Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the \njurisdictional issue. (Doc. 41).

So, the remaining two grounds raised by Defendant in his motion for judgment on the \npleadings are now ripe for review. \nI.  Background \n  Plaintiffs are eight African-American citizens of Alabama. One Plaintiff resides in \nCongressional District (“CD”) 1, one resides in CD 2, one resides in CD 3, and five reside in CD \n7. The redistricting plan currently used in Alabama, Senate Bill 484, allegedly “packs” African-\nAmerican voters into CD 7. See S.B. 484, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011). The Alabama legislature \nestablished CD 7 as a majority-minority district following the 1982 Amendments of the Voting \nRights Act. Nearly one-third of Alabama’s African-American population falls into CD 7.1 Prior \nto the passage of S.B. 484, the black voting age population (BVAP) of CD 7 under the 2002 \nredistricting plan was 58.33%. Now, the CD 7 BVAP is 60.91%.  \n  Plaintiffs argue that S.B. 484 redrew district lines to “move” African-American voters \nfrom predominantly white districts into CD 7 to “pack” the district designated as a majority-\nminority district with African-American voters. But the plan also allegedly “cracks” African-\nAmerican voters in CDs 1, 2, and 3 by splitting among three districts those African-American \nvoters who could be grouped together in a second majority-minority district. Plaintiffs contend \nthat the African-American population in these districts should be united to form a second \nmajority-minority CD. \n  Plaintiffs raise a Section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act, alleging vote dilution. The \nSupreme Court identified three preconditions necessary to establish a vote dilution claim: (1) the \nminority group “is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in the \nsingle-member district,” (2) the minority group is “politically cohesive,” and (3) “the white \n                                                           \n1 Based on the facts provided, the court cannot determine whether the CD 7 under the 2011 \nredistricting plan is the same CD 7 as drawn following the 1982 Amendments. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 3 of 15\nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it—in the absence of special circumstances, such \nas the minority candidate running unopposed—usually to defeat the minority’s preferred \ncandidate.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50–51 (1986) (internal citations omitted). \nII. Standard of Review \n  Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to move for judgment \non the pleadings after the pleadings are closed, but early enough to not delay trial. See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(c). A judgment on the pleadings is appropriate “when there are no material facts in \ndispute, and judgment may be rendered by considering the substance of the pleadings and any \njudicially noticed facts.” Horsley v. Rivera, 292 F.3d 695, 700 (11th Cir. 2002). To determine \nwhether the movant is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings, the court should “accept as true all \nmaterial facts alleged in the non-moving party’s pleading, and . . . view those facts in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party.” Perez v. Wells Fargo N.A., 774 F.3d 1329, 1335 (11th \nCir. 2014). \n  The court analyzes a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings the same way as a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See \nDial v. City of Bessemer, No. 2:14-cv-01297-RDP, 2016 WL 3054728, at *3 (N.D. Ala. May 31, \n2016). (“A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is analyzed the same as a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”). “A motion to dismiss and a motion for judgment on the pleadings \nshould not be granted unless ‘the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which \nwould entitle him to relief.” Losey v. Warden, 521 F. App’x 717, 719 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting \nHorsley v. Feldt, 304 F.3d 1225, 1131 (11th Cir. 2002)). So, “to survive a motion for judgment \non the pleadings, ‘a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 4 of 15\nclaim to relief that it plausible on its face.’” Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009)). \n  To be plausible on its face, the claim must contain enough facts that “allow[] the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678. Although “[t]he plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’” the \ncomplaint must demonstrate “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.” Id. “Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s \nliability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’” \nId. (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \n  The Supreme Court has identified “two working principles” for the district court to use in \napplying the facial plausibility standard. The first principle is that, in evaluating motions to \ndismiss, the court must assume the veracity of well-pleaded factual allegations; however, the \ncourt does not have to accept as true legal conclusions even when “couched as . . . factual \nallegation[s]” or “threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The second principle is that “only a complaint \nthat states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.” Id. at 679.  \n  Thus, under prong one, the court determines the factual allegations that are well-pleaded \nand assumes their veracity, and then proceeds, under prong two, to determine the claim’s \nplausibility given the well-pleaded facts. That task is “context-specific” and, to survive the \nmotion, the allegations must permit the court based on its “judicial experience and common \nsense . . . to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. If the \ncourt determines that well-pleaded facts, accepted as true, do not state a claim that is plausible, \nthe claim must be dismissed. Id. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 5 of 15\nIII. Discussion \nDefendant raises two grounds why he is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings: first, \nPlaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of a proper remedy; and second, Plaintiffs’ claims \nare barred by the doctrine of laches. The court will discuss each argument in turn. \na.  Existence of a proper remedy \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to seek a proper remedy, which causes Plaintiffs to \nlack standing. If a party cannot show that the injury can be redressed by the litigation, then the \nparty lacks standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) \n(identifying the three elements of standing: injury-in-fact, causality, and redressability). \nThe Eleventh Circuit has held that a plaintiff must demonstrate a viable remedy to \nproperly allege a Section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act. See Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d \n1494, 1530–31 (11th Cir. 1994) (“A district court must determine as part of the Gingles \nthreshold inquiry whether it can fashion a permissible remedy in the particular context of the \nchallenged system.”). Specifically, where a plaintiff seeks redistricting to create a new majority-\nminority district, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the “minority voters possess the potential to \nelect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice.” Thornburg, 478 U.S. \nat 57 n.17. \nPlaintiffs alleged in the complaint that “[t]he African-American population in Alabama is \nsufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority of eligible voters—\nmeaning a majority of the voting age population—in two congressional districts.” (Doc. 14 at 2). \nSpecifically, they seek the adoption of a new congressional redistricting plan that adds a second \nmajority-minority district in Alabama. (Id. at 29–30). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 6 of 15\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs offered these conclusory allegations without factual \nsupport. But Plaintiffs support each assertion with statistical and anecdotal evidence. Plaintiffs \npoint out that CDs 1, 2, and 3 each have a heavily African-American area within a majority-\nwhite district. (Doc. 14 at 12). Plaintiffs explain in their complaint how “African-American \nvoters in Alabama are politically cohesive and overwhelmingly support[] Democratic \ncandidates,” with several statistical examples from Alabama elections in the CDs at issue. (Id. at \n13). In contrast, “[t]he white majority . . . overwhelmingly supports Republican candidates.” \n(Id.). Defendant’s argument attacking the complaint as “conclusory” seems as though he has not \nread past the first page of the complaint because the complaint as a whole contains the support \nand explanation for the initial conclusory statements. \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant conflates the requirements for pleading with the \nrequirements for proving. While Defendant is correct that Plaintiffs must eventually prove that a \nnew redistricting plan would resolve the alleged Section 2 violation, such proof is not necessary \nat the pleading stage. Courts hesitate to require a plaintiff to prove the elements of a claim at the \nmotion to dismiss stage. “Asking for plausible grounds to infer [an element of a claim] does not \nimpose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the claim].” Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n556. And “[i]t is no accident that most cases under section 2 have been decided on summary \njudgment or after a verdict, and not on a motion to dismiss.” Metts v. Murphy, 363 F.3d 8, 11 \n(1st Cir. 2004) (holding that the district court was too quick to dismiss the case because “the \nplaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to develop evidence before the merits are resolved”). \nDefendant further argues that one unreported district court case indicates that a plaintiff \nmust submit a map presenting an alternative redistricting plan to satisfy the potential remedy \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 7 of 15\nrequirement. See Broward Citizens for Fair Districts v. Broward Cty., No. 12-60317-CIV, 2012 \nWL 1110053, at *5 n.6 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 2012) (“The Court agrees that this [failure to present \nalternative maps] represents an additional pleading deficiency in Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint.”). But another district court specifically refused to follow Broward Citizens, noting \nthat in Broward Citizens “that court extended what is an evidentiary requirement for purposes of \nsummary judgment to the pleading stage of litigation.” Luna v. Cty. of Kern, No. 1:16-cv-00568-\nDAD-JLT, 2016 WL 4679723, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2016). The District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of California noted that “[f]orcing plaintiffs to develop an unobjectionable map, before \ndiscovery even begins, would be putting the cart before the horse.” Id. This court agrees. \nTo satisfy the pleading requirements, Plaintiffs only must allege with “enough fact to \nraise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence” that a second majority-\nminority district exists. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. In Luna, the court found that such a district \nplausibly existed when the plaintiffs alleged that the Latino population in Kern County grew \nfrom 25% to 34%. Luna, 2016 WL 4679723, at *4. The court inferred from those statistics that \n“a minority group compromising nearly one-third of the county’s total voting population could \ncomprise majorities in each of at least two county supervisorial districts.” Id. \nLikewise in our case, Plaintiffs allege that the three allegedly “cracked” CDs contain four \ncounties with large minority populations: Macon County in CD 3, 82.6% African-American \npopulation; Mobile County in CD 1, 34.6% African-American population; Monroe County in \nCD 1, 34.6% African-American population; and Montgomery County in CDs 2,3, and 7, 54.7% \nAfrican-American population. (Doc. 31 at 16). Plaintiffs also explain how the area known as the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 8 of 15\n“Black Belt”2 was specifically divided between the four CDs at issue in the complaint, packing \nminorities into CD 7 and cracking CDs 1, 2, and 3. (Id.). From this division of the Black Belt, the \ncourt can infer that a second majority-minority district could plausibly be formed. \nSo, while Plaintiffs have not yet proven by presenting an alternative district map that an \nalternative redistricting plan that resolves the alleged Section 2 violations definitely exists, they \nhave met the burden to plead Section 2 violations by showing that such a plan plausibly could \nexist. Because such a plan plausibly exists, the court must deny Defendant’s motion for judgment \non the pleadings on the grounds of standing. \nb.  Doctrine of laches \n  Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the doctrine of laches. \nSpecifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs’ claims first became available in June 2011 when \nthe redistricting plan was passed; that Plaintiffs had no excuse for delay because the 2010 Census \ndata upon which their claim is based was available since February 2011; and that the state of \nAlabama would be prejudiced because a final decision (after appeal) would not be reached until \n2019 or 2020, requiring a new redistricting plan to be drawn based on outdated census \ninformation from 2010—and shortly before statewide redistricting using the 2020 Census—if \nPlaintiffs succeed. \n  Preliminarily, Plaintiffs contend that the doctrine of laches only applies in cases seeking \nretrospective damages. See Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., \n                                                           \n2 The “Black Belt” is so named “because the soil in that region of the state is dark in color. \nAdditionally, during the period immediately following the Civil War, the majority population in \nthat area of the state was black.” Knight v. Alabama, 787 F. Supp. 1030, 1067 n.13 (N.D. Ala. \n1991); see also Zachary L. Guyse, Note, Alabama’s Original Sin: Property Taxes, Racism, and \nConstitutional Reform in Alabama, 65 Ala. L. Rev. 519, 532 (2013) (“The name ‘Black Belt’ is \nprimarily derived from the dark, rich layer of topsoil that runs across the width of roughly twelve \ncounties in central Alabama, which made the region extremely fertile for cotton farming.”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 9 of 15\n533 F.3d 1287, 1321 (11th Cir. 2008) (“[L]aches serves as a bar only to the recovery of \nretrospective damages, not to prospective relief.”). Here Plaintiffs seek no retrospective \ndamages, solely prospective relief. But, as Defendant points out, redistricting challenges are \nsubject to the doctrine of laches because of the ten-year expiration date of electoral districts. See \nSanders v. Dooly Cty., 245 F.3d 1289, 1290–91 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (applying the \ndoctrine of laches to a voting rights case). Electoral districts expire every ten years because the \nfederal government conducts a new census every ten years, which the state then uses to create an \nupdated redistricting plan. See 2020 Census: What is the Census?, U.S. Census Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html (last visited \nMar. 11, 2019). \n  So, because the doctrine of laches can apply to redistricting cases, the court will address \nthe elements of the doctrine. The doctrine of laches requires three elements: “(1) a delay in \nasserting a right or a claim; (2) that the delay was not excusable; and (3) that there was undue \nprejudice to the party against whom the claim is asserted.” Venus Lines Agency Inc. v. CVG Int’l \nAm., Inc., 234 F.3d 1225, 1230 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Kason Indus., Inc. v. Component \nHardware Grp., Inc., 120 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir. 1997)). Each element will be discussed in \nturn. \ni.  Delay in asserting a right or claim \n  Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs delayed in challenging the redistricting plan because the \nclaim became available in June 2011, when Alabama’s redistricting plan went into effect, and \nbecause the 2010 Census, which Plaintiffs use to support their arguments for redistricting, was \nalready available to Plaintiffs in June 2011. Further, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs did not \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 10 of 15\nchallenge the past four elections in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2016, but instead waited until just \nbefore the government conducts the 2020 Census. \n  Defendant suggests that, because Plaintiffs could have filed suit seven years prior, the \nclaim is inexcusably delayed. One court has found inexcusable delay when the challenged \nredistricting plan was no longer the plan used. See White v. Daniel, 909 F.2d 99, 102–03 (4th \nCir. 1990) (finding that the plaintiffs delayed by challenging the 1981 plan—which was just a \ncontinuation of the 1971 plan with no changes—when plaintiffs never challenged the 1971 plan \nand waited until after the last election under the 1981 plan to file suit). A different court found \ninexcusable delay when only one election under the challenged plan remained, and four elections \nbased on that plan had passed. See Fouts v. Harris, 88 F. Supp. 2d 1351, 1354 (S.D. Fla. 1999), \naff’d sub nom. Chandler v. Harris, 529 U.S. 1084 (2000). \n  Nine of the Plaintiffs were registered voters in Alabama in June 2011.3 Those nine \ncitizens delayed in bringing their case, but was the delay excusable? And Ms. Chestnut, the one \nPlaintiff not residing in Alabama in June 2011, has been a registered voter in Alabama since \n2016. (Doc. 31 at 23). Even though she did not live in Alabama when the redistricting plan first \ncame into effect, she has had two years to bring such a claim. \n  But Plaintiffs also argue that the claim did not necessarily arise in 2011, which leads to \nthe second element of the doctrine of laches. \nii.  Delay was not excusable \n  Delay is “measured from the time at which the plaintiff knows or should know she has a \nprovable claim.” Kason Indus., Inc., 120 F.3d at 1206. Plaintiffs argue that, at the time the 2011 \n                                                           \n3 While Plaintiffs do not allege that all nine of them were in fact registered to vote in June 2011, \nthe court presumes this to be true because Plaintiffs only argue that Ms. Chestnut could not have \nbrought her case any sooner because she did not live in Alabama until 2016. (Doc. 31 at 22). \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 11 of 15\nredistricting plan was passed, they were not immediately aware that their votes would be diluted. \nAdditionally, Ms. Chestnut, did not reside is Alabama until 2016, so she could not have sued \nearlier.  \n  The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that “a plaintiff’s reasonable need to fully \ninvestigate its claims” may excuse delay. Black Warrior Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 781 F.3d 1271, 1285 (11th Cir. 2015). But even if the nine Plaintiffs who were citizens \nin 2011 did not realize their claim arose in June 2011, they were registered voters in Alabama for \nthe next three election cycles before bringing a claim. Plaintiffs suggest that Ms. Chestnut could \nhave reasonably taken until 2018 to investigate her claims, although they do not explain why the \nother plaintiffs would be justified in a seven-year delay from the 2011 redistricting. And \nPlaintiffs provide no demonstration of the steps taken to investigate the claim that would justify \nthe delay.  \n  As to Ms. Chestnut, one plaintiff’s delay does not necessarily prejudice others. For \nexample, a political party’s sophisticated knowledge of a state’s election laws and awareness of a \nclaim is not imputed to ordinary citizens Nader 2000 Primary Comm., Inc. v. Hechler, 112 F. \nSupp. 2d, 575, 579 n.2 (S.D. W. Va. 2000). But our case does not involve one sophisticated \nplaintiff’s greater knowledge being imputed to ordinary citizens. Instead, our case involves nine \ncitizens—who supposedly had been investigating their claims since they arose in June 2011—\njoined by a new citizen, who then needed an additional two years after moving into the state to \njoin the other nine in bringing this claim. The court finds these excuses for the delay \nunpersuasive. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 12 of 15\niii. Defendant was prejudiced \n  Defendant argues that the state of Alabama would be prejudiced because, if Plaintiffs \nwin, a new redistricting plan must be drawn using 2010 Census data merely a year or two before \nthe new 2020 Census; Defendant points to demographic shifts in Alabama since the 2010 \nCensus, implying that the redistricting plan will have to change in 2021. (Doc. 27 at 18). \nDefendant also contends that redistricting now would spend valuable state resources that could \notherwise be allocated to the 2021 redistricting plan, while noting that Alabama may lose a \ncongressional seat following the 2020 Census. \n  In support, Defendant cites the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, \nwhich held that forcing the state to redistrict when one election remained under the challenged \nplan “would come at great cost and yield results that are at best uncertain, and at worst, \nperverse.” MacGovern v. Connolly, 637 F. Supp. 111, 116 (D. Mass. 1986). But at the time of \nthat case, the 1985 Census was not yet complete, and the state was already in the process of \nredistricting. The court noted, “Since the 1985 census may not be complete, an injunction at this \npoint could have the ironic effect of forcing a hasty reapportionment based on the already-\nsuperseded 1975 state census . . . .” Id. In our case, redistricting will certainly be costly. But the \n2010 Census still remains the most current data available as of today. \n  Defendant also cites Fouts, in which the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida found that forcing the state to redistrict two years before the mandatory redistricting \nwould “result[] in voter confusion, instability, dislocation, and [a] financial and logistical burden \non the state.” Fouts, 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354. But as noted by Plaintiffs, “redistricting to remedy a \n§ 2 violation will always require the allocation of some voters to different districts.” (Doc. 31 at \n30). Plaintiffs also point out that a court has previously ordered redistricting within two years of \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 13 of 15\nanother redistricting. See Larios v. Cox, 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320 (N.D. Ga. 2004), aff’d, 542 U.S. \n947 (2004) (finding that the 2002 reapportionment plan was unconstitutional, and ordering \nredistricting in 2004). But the court notes that the plaintiffs in this case seek a new \nreapportionment plan two years before the next scheduled reapportionment plan, while the \nplaintiffs in Larios sought a new reapportionment plan two years after the last reapportionment \nplan. So Larios does not provide support for Plaintiffs’ position. \n  Further, Defendant cites Sanders in support of his argument that Plaintiffs’ delay \nprejudiced him. In Sanders, voters in Dooly County, Georgia sued county officials, alleging that \nthe county commission and board of education districting plan contained racially gerrymandered \ndistricts in violation of equal protection. 245 F.3d at 1290. The plaintiffs waited five years after \nthe plan was released to sue. Id. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the U.S. District Court did not \nabuse its discretion by ruling that the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief were barred by \nlaches. Id. at 1291. But the Eleventh Circuit did not independently evaluate whether the delay \nactually prejudiced the defendants. The district court concluded that the delay prejudiced the \ndefendants because (1) the back-to-back redistrictings would cause confusion and expense, and \n(2) the census data available was “over 10 years old and thus unreliable.” Id. at 1290–91.  \n  But this case differs from Sanders. As Plaintiffs point out, the congressional redistricting \nhere would likely be less confusing than the localized county redistricting in Sanders. \nCongressional races are better funded and highly publicized, so voters would be more aware of \nwhich district they belong. (Doc. 31 at 30). And the 2010 Census data available here, while nine \nyears old, is more reliable than the 10 year old data in Sanders because the government has not \nyet taken a new census. See 2020 Census: What is the Census?, U.S. Census Bureau, \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about.html (last visited \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 14 of 15\nMar. 11, 2019) (explaining that the federal government took the first census in 1790 “and our \ncountry has every 10 years since”).  \n  While the data available in this case is nine years old, it remains the most up-to-date \ninformation available—until the government completes the 2020 Census. The U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of Florida held that ordering a state to redistrict in 1999 forced the state \nto use the 1990 Census data, and “[s]uch old census figures have been recognized as unduly \nprejudicial because they fail to provide a basis for ‘fair and accurate representation to the \ncitizens.’” Fouts, 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354 (quoting White, 909 F.2d at 104). And while \ncongressional races are better funded and more highly publicized, the court remains unconvinced \nthat a more publicized election will necessarily educate voters on where the newly drawn district \nlines lay. As noted by the Fourth Circuit, “two reapportionments within a short period of two \nyears would greatly prejudice the [state] and its citizens by creating instability and dislocation in \nthe electoral system and by imposing great financial and logistical burdens.” White, 909 F.2d at \n104. \n  The court finds that to force the state of Alabama to redistrict twice in two years—once \nbased on nine-year-old census data—would result in prejudice. This prejudice was caused by \nPlaintiffs’ inexcusable delay in waiting until 2018 to file suit. So, the doctrine of laches bars \nPlaintiffs’ claim to the extent Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief. \n  But, in addition to injunctive relief, Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief. Redistricting \ncommittees sometimes base new redistricting plans on existing plans. The Eleventh Circuit has \nheld that, while the defendant may be prejudiced by the plaintiff’s delay in bringing a voting \nrights claim for injunctive relief, the same prejudice does not apply to a claim for declaratory \nrelief. See Sanders, 245 F.3d at 1291–92. Finding the current plan unconstitutional—if it is—\n14 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 52   Filed 03/27/19   Page 15 of 15\nwould prevent the committee from reusing the plan as the basis for the 2021 redistricting plan. \nSee id. at 1291 (noting that declaratory relief in a voting rights case may “prevent the Attorney \nGeneral from using the [challenged] plan as a baseline for retrogression analysis in the [new] \ncensus round of preclearance proceedings”). Even if the court were to find that Defendant would \nbe prejudiced as to injunctive relief, declaratory relief would still be available to Plaintiffs. \n  Because Defendant cannot demonstrate prejudice as to Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory \nrelief, the doctrine of laches will not bar declaratory relief. So, Plaintiffs’ claim will remain as to \ndeclaratory relief. \nIV. Conclusion \n  For the reasons discussed above, the court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART \nDefendant John Merrill’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court will DENY \nDefendant’s motion as to the standing issue. The court will GRANT Defendant’s motion as to \nthe doctrine of laches issue for injunctive relief. The court will DENY Defendant’s motion as to \nthe doctrine of laches issue for declaratory relief. The court will enter a separate Order consistent \nwith this Memorandum Opinion. \nDONE and ORDERED this 27th day of March, 2019.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nKARON OWEN BOWDRE \nCHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n15 \n ",

Introduction \nThis lawsuit challenges Alabama’s 2011 congressional districting plan (the \n“2011 Plan”) for failing to provide African Americans an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the political process and elect their preferred candidates. Though \nAfrican  Americans  comprise  more  than  a  quarter  of  Alabama’s  voting  age \npopulation,  their  voting  strength  is  confined  to  just  one  of  the  State’s  seven \ncongressional districts. \nAt trial, Plaintiffs will prove that the African-American community in central \nand  southern  Alabama  is  sufficiently  numerous  and  geographically  compact  to \nconstitute a majority of the voting age population in two congressional districts. \nDespite this, the 2011 Plan packs most African Americans in this region into the \nState’s  single  pre-existing  majority-minority  district  and  divides  the  remaining \nAfrican-American  population  among  three  districts  in  which  they  comprise  an \nineffectual political minority.  \nAfrican-American voters in Congressional District (“CD”) 7, the State’s sole \nmajority-minority  district,  have  consistently  enjoyed  overwhelming  electoral \nsuccess in congressional elections. From 2002 through 2010, African-American-\npreferred candidates won CD 7 by margins of more than 45 percentage points. \nDespite this fact, the 2011 Plan increased the African-American population in CD 7 \nby  almost  an  additional  percentage  point  and  further  splintered  the  remaining \n \n- 1 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 9 of 46\n \nAfrican-American communities—located predominantly in the State’s Black Belt \nregion—among CDs 1, 2, and 3. Indeed, the African-American population alone in \nCDs 1, 2, and 3 constitutes over 90% of the population of a full congressional \ndistrict. Instead of concentrating African-American voters in CD 7 and dispersing \nothers across the surrounding districts, the 2011 Plan could―and should―include a \nsecond majority-minority congressional district in the Black Belt region.  \nPlaintiffs challenge the 2011 Plan under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n(“VRA”),  which  prohibits  district  plans  that  dilute  a  minority  group’s  voting \nstrength. Section 2 calls for a two-step inquiry to determine whether Plaintiffs lack \n“an equal opportunity to participate in the political processes and to elect candidates \nof their choice.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 (1986). The first phase, the \n“Gingles preconditions,” examines whether it is possible to create an additional \nmajority-minority district and whether voting in the region is racially polarized. As \nthe facts above suggest, the evidence at trial will easily satisfy these requirements. \nThe second phase of the analysis examines the past and present realities of \nAlabama politics through a series of factors, which together show that Alabama’s \nfailure to create a second majority-African-American congressional district denies \nAfrican Americans equal footing in congressional elections. The facts and evidence \nrelevant to these considerations―including Alabama’s sordid history of voting-\n \n- 2 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 10 of 46\n \nrelated discrimination, the effects borne of discrimination across sectors, and the \nabsence  of  African-American  elected  officials  in  statewide  office―are  largely \nbeyond  dispute.  As  a  result,  the  evidence  at  trial  will  confirm  that  Alabama’s \ncongressional map violates the VRA. \nII.  Legal Framework of a Vote Dilution Claim Under Section 2 \n  \nThe VRA is one of this nation’s seminal pieces of civil rights legislation. \nSection 2 of the VRA, under which Plaintiffs bring this suit, makes unlawful any \nlaw that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United \nStates to vote on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). In 1982, Congress \namended Section 2 to reject the Supreme Court’s “plurality opinion in Mobile v. \nBolden,  446  U.S.  55  (1980),  which  had  declared  that,  in  order  to  establish  a \nviolation[,] . . . minority voters must prove that a contested electoral mechanism was \nintentionally adopted or maintained by state officials for a discriminatory purpose.” \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 35. Today, “[a] discriminatory result is all that is required” to \nestablish a Section 2 claim; “discriminatory intent is not necessary.” Ga. State Conf. \nof NAACP v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 775 F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir. 2015).  \nA voting law dilutes minority voting strength in violation of Section 2 if, under \nthe totality of the circumstances, the “political processes leading to nomination or \nelection in the State . . . are not equally open to participation by members of [a racial \n \n- 3 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 11 of 46\n \nminority group] . . . in that its members have less opportunity than other members \nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of \ntheir  choice.”  52  U.S.C.  § 10301(b).  The  “essence”  of  this  claim  is  that  the \nchallenged  law  “interacts  with  social  conditions  to  cause  an  inequality  in  the \nopportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred candidates.” \nGingles,  478  U.S.  at  47.  In  the  context  of  a  single-member  districting  plan, \n“‘[d]ilution of racial minority group voting strength may be caused’ either ‘by the \ndispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of \nvoters or from the concentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an \nexcessive  majority.’”  Voinovich  v.  Quilter,  507  U.S.  146,  154  (1993)  (quoting \nGingles, 478 U.S. at 46 n.11). Alabama’s current congressional map commits both \nforms of dilution: it packs African-American voters into CD 7, and it divides the \nremaining African-American population in the area between CDs 1, 2, and 3. \nThe legal analysis under Section 2 follows two steps. First, to make a prima \nfacie case under Section 2 a plaintiff must establish three preconditions: (1) the \nminority group is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a \nmajority  in  a  single-member  district,”  (2)  the  minority  group  is  “politically \ncohesive,” and (3) the majority votes “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually \nto defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50–51. If the \n \n- 4 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 12 of 46\n \npreconditions are met, the Court then engages in a “totality of the circumstances” \nanalysis to confirm what the Gingles preconditions suggest: that the challenged \npractice impermissibly impairs minority voting strength. Fayette Cty., 775 F.3d at \n1342. “[I]t will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish \nthe existence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation \nof § 2 under the totality of the circumstances.” Id. (quoting Jenkins v. Red Clay \nConsol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1135 (3d Cir. 1993)).  \nIn conducting the totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry, the Court engages in \n“a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality.” Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 45. In particular, the Court considers seven principal factors set forth in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to Section 2, \nknown as the “Senate Factors.” Id. at 44–45 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28–29 \n(1982) (“S. Rep.”)). Those factors are: (1) “the extent of any history of official \ndiscrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the \nmembers of the minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the \ndemocratic process”; (2) “the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or \npolitical subdivision is racially polarized”; (3) “the extent to which the state or \npolitical  subdivision  has  used  unusually  large  election  districts,  majority  vote \nrequirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures that \n \n- 5 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 13 of 46\n \nmay enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group”; (4) “if \nthere is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority group have \nbeen denied access to that process”; (5) “the extent to which members of the minority \ngroup in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such \nareas as education, employment and health, which hinder their ability to participate \neffectively in the political process”; (6) “whether political campaigns have been \ncharacterized  by  overt  or  subtle  racial  appeals”;  and  (7)  “the  extent  to  which \nmembers of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.”  \nId. at 36–37 (quoting S. Rep. at 28–29).1  \nThe Senate Factors are “neither comprehensive nor exclusive,” Gingles, 478 \nU.S. at 45, and “there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be \nproved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.” United States v. \nMarengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1566 n.33 (11th Cir. 1984) (quoting S. Rep. \nat 29). In other words, they are not a “mechanical ‘point counting’ device”; a failure \n                                                 \n1 The Senate Report also explicates two additional considerations that may have \nprobative value if they weigh in favor of a finding of dilution: “whether there is a \nsignificant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized \nneeds of the members of the minority group,” and “whether the policy underlying \nthe state[’s] . . . use of such voting . . . standard . . . is tenuous.” Id. at 37 (quoting S. \nRep. at 29); see also United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1572 \n(11th Cir. 1984) (“[U]nresponsiveness [is] relevant only if the plaintiff chose to \nmake  it  so,  and  []  although  a  showing  of  unresponsiveness  might  have  some \nprobative value a showing of responsiveness would have very little.”). \n \n- 6 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 14 of 46\n \n“to establish any particular factor is not rebuttal evidence of non-dilution.” S. Rep. \nat 29 n.118.  \nIII.  Expected Trial Evidence and Argument \nA.  Gingles Preconditions \n1.  Gingles 1: The African-American Community in Alabama Is \nSufficiently  Large  and  Geographically  Compact  to \nConstitute A Majority in Two Congressional Districts \nThe  first  Gingles  precondition  asks  whether  Plaintiffs  have  identified  a \nminority group that is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a \nmajority in a single-member district.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. Plaintiffs will satisfy \nthis  precondition  at  trial  by  offering  four  “Illustrative  Plans”  drawn  by  expert \ndemographer William Cooper. The Illustrative Plans show four different ways in \nwhich Alabama’s congressional map could have two majority-minority districts, \neach containing a geographically compact African-American community.2 \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Cooper’s initial report offered four plans: Illustrative Plans 1, 2, 3, and 4. \nPlaintiffs’ Exhibit (“PX”) 001 ¶¶ 54–73. At that time, Mr. Cooper lacked access to \nthe addresses of Alabama’s congressional incumbents. After he discovered that \nRepresentative Sewell lived outside of CD 7 in three of the four illustrative plans, \nMr. Cooper replaced Illustrative Plans 1, 2, and 3 with new Revised Plans 1, 2, and \n3, respectively. PX059 ¶¶ 59–68. These revisions “are minor and have no impact \noutside of Jefferson County.” Id. ¶ 50. Plaintiffs’ references to the “Illustrative \nPlans” in this brief and at trial refer to the currently operative plans: Revised Plans \n1, 2, and 3, and Illustrative Plan 4. \n \n- 7 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 15 of 46\n \na.  Numerousness:  The  Illustrative  Plans  Each  Include \nTwo Majority-Minority Districts \nThe numerousness requirement under Gingles involves a “straightforward,” \n“objective numeric test: Do minorities make up more than 50 percent of the voting-\nage population in the relevant geographic area?” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, \n18 (2009). The answer here is unequivocally yes. In each of the Illustrative Plans, \nmore than 50% of voting-age residents of CDs 2 and 7 are African American. PX059 \nfigs. 5, 7, 9; PX001 fig. 18. The black voting-age population (“BVAP”) of CDs 2 \nand 7 in each Illustrative Plan is as follows: \nPlan  CD 2 BVAP  CD 7 BVAP \n2011 Plan  27.90%  60.91% \nRevised Plan 1  51.32%  50.65% \nRevised Plan 2  51.37%  51.95% \nRevised Plan 3  50.99%  50.34% \nIllustrative Plan 4  50.33%  50.74% \nPX001 figs. 11, 18; PX059 figs. 5, 7, 9. To the extent Defendant claims a candidate \nof choice of African Americans in CDs 2 or 7 might lose a particular election because \nthe  BVAP  percentages  are  not  high  enough—an  assertion  his  own  expert  has \nessentially abandoned, see infra Section IV.B—this argument is irrelevant to the first \nprecondition. See Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 950 F. \nSupp. 2d 1294, 1303–04 (N.D. Ga. 2013) (rejecting as irrelevant the assertion that a \nproposed district with 50.22% BVAP was too low because “Bartlett holds that a \nbright-line 50% rule applies to” the first Gingles precondition), aff’d in part, vacated \n \n- 8 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 16 of 46\n \nin part, and rev’d in part on other grounds by Fayette Cty., 775 F.3d 1336.3  \nDefendant  also  will  likely  argue,  erroneously,  that  Revised  Plan  3  and \nIllustrative Plan 4 do not contain two majority-minority districts because, according \nto him, individuals who self-identify on the Census as both African American and \nanother race, or as African American and Hispanic, should not be considered African \nAmerican.  This  argument  directly  conflicts  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  clear \ninstruction that in a case “involv[ing] an examination of only one minority group’s \neffective exercise of the electoral franchise,” a court should “look at all individuals \nwho identify themselves as black” when determining the BVAP of a given district. \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 473 n.1 (2003). And in any event, Defendant has \nstipulated that even when excluding multi-racial and Hispanic African Americans \nfrom  the  BVAP  calculation,  at  least  two  of  the  Illustrative  Plans  contain  two \nmajority-African-American districts. Joint List of Agreed & Disputed Principal \nFacts (“Stipulated Facts” or “SF”), ECF No. 95, ¶ 86. Indeed, when one considers \nonly citizen residents of Alabama, see ALA. CONST. art. VIII, § 177 (requiring all \n                                                 \n3 In Fayette County, the district court granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their \nSection 2 claim. 950 F. Supp. 2d 1294. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit explained \nthat while the existence of genuine issues of material fact in the case made summary \njudgment inappropriate, “[w]e cannot say that the district court misconstrued our \nprecedent or reached its conclusions based on a misunderstanding of the applicable \nlaw.” Fayette Cty., 775 F.3d at 1343–44. \n \n- 9 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 17 of 46\n \nelectors to be “citizen[s] of the United States”), all four of the Illustrative Plans have \ntwo districts with a voting-age population that is majority single-race, non-Hispanic \nBlack. PX059 fig. 1. \nb.  Compactness:  The  African-American  Communities \nWithin  Illustrative  Districts  2  and  7  Are \nGeographically Compact \nThe  minority  communities  in  CDs  2  and  7  of  each  Illustrative  Plan  are \ngeographically compact because they exist within districts that adhere to traditional \ndistricting principles. This “compactness” aspect of “[t]he first Gingles condition \nrefers to the compactness of the minority population, not to the compactness of the \ncontested districts.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 433 \n(2006)  (“LULAC”).  “While  no  precise  rule  has  emerged  governing  § 2 \ncompactness,”  id.,  a  plaintiff  satisfies  this  requirement  when  she  proposes  a \nmajority-minority district that is “consistent with traditional districting principles.” \nDavis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1425 (11th Cir. 1998). These principles include \npopulation equality, contiguity, geographical compactness, maintaining traditional \nboundaries, protection of incumbents, and maintaining communities of interest. See, \ne.g., Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1307. They also include avoiding dilution of a \nminority group’s voting strength. See PX084 § IV.2.  \nHere, the districts in the Illustrative Plans are equal in population. SF ¶ 87; \nPX059 figs. 5, 7, 9; PX001 fig. 18. None of the Illustrative Plans pair congressional \n \n- 10 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 18 of 46\n \nincumbents. SF ¶ 88. And the Illustrative Plans are contiguous, meaning that each \ndistrict is “connected in one piece.” Terrebonne Parish Branch NAACP v. Jindal, \n274 F. Supp. 3d 395, 424 (M.D. La. 2017). \nThe  Illustrative  Plans  also  maintain  as  many,  and  in  many  cases  more, \ntraditional boundaries than the 2011 Plan. Defendant stipulates that: (1) each plan \nsplits the same number of, or fewer, counties than the 2011 Plan, SF ¶ 89; PX059 \nfig. 12; (2) the number of discrete county splits in each plan is lower than under the \n2011 Plan, SF ¶ 90; PX059 fig. 12; (3) each plan resolves the 2011 Plan’s three-\ndistrict split of Montgomery County by placing Montgomery County entirely into a \nsingle district, SF ¶ 92; PX001 ¶ 53, fig. 18; PX059 figs. 4, 6, 8; and (4) each plan \nsplits the same number of, or fewer, populated voter tabulation districts (“VTDs”) \nthan the 2011 Plan, SF ¶ 91; PX059 fig. 12.4  \nDistricts 2 and 7 in each plan are also reasonably compact. See Fayette Cty., \n950 F. Supp. 2d at 1307 (“[W]hile Plaintiffs’ evidence regarding the geographical \ncompactness of their proposed district does not alone establish compactness under \n§ 2, that evidence, combined with their evidence that the district complies with other \ntraditional redistricting principles, is directly relevant to determining whether the \n                                                 \n4 The Census Bureau’s VTDs generally correspond to the State’s voting precincts as \nthey exist at the time of the Census. PX001 at 19 n.11. A VTD split is “populated” \nwhen residents live on both sides of the split. \n \n- 11 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 19 of 46\n \ndistrict is compact under § 2.”). To objectively analyze the compactness of these \ndistricts,  Mr.  Cooper  utilized  two  commonly-used  tests  in  redistricting  cases, \n“Reock” and “Polsby-Popper.”5 See, e.g., Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1308 \n(utilizing  both  tests  in  determining  that  plaintiffs  met  Gingles’  compactness \nrequirement). Based on these measurements, “compared to other statewide plan[s], \nthe illustrative plans are clearly within the norm.” PX001 ¶ 85. And while a proposed \nmajority-minority district need not be as compact as the districts in an existing plan, \nFayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 3d at 1308, the Reock and Polsby-Popper scores of \nDistricts 2 and 7 in each plan are the same as or higher than the least compact district \nin the 2011 Plan. See PX059 fig. 11; Houston v. Lafayette Cty., Miss., 56 F.3d 606, \n611 (5th Cir. 1995) (reversing a district court’s conclusion that plaintiffs’ illustrative \nmajority-minority district was not compact because, among other reasons, “the \ndistrict in the plaintiff residents’ proposed plan [wa]s not substantially less compact” \nthan the districts in the existing and previous plans); Terrebonne Parish, 274 F. \nSupp. 3d at 424 (finding that the compactness of a proposed district “compares \nfavorably both in terms of its shape and its geographical compactness to other \nsurrounding electoral districts”).  \n                                                 \n5 Both tests provide a ratio comparing the size of each district with a circle, the \nideally compact shape.

The African-American communities in the Black Belt region share \nwell-recognized historical, social, and economic ties. See, e.g., Ala. Legislative \nBlack  Caucus  v.  Alabama,  231  F.  Supp.  3d  1026,  1036  (M.D.  Ala.  2017) \n(referencing the Black Belt’s “history of agriculture and slavery”); see also Lynch \nex rel. Lynch v. Alabama, No. 08-S-450-NE, 2011 WL 13186739, at *30–43 (N.D. \nAla. Nov. 7, 2011) (outlining the Black Belt’s history); PX001 at 10 n.8. Indeed, the \nState has recognized these shared interests by placing the Black Belt counties in the \nsame Alabama State Board of Education (“SBOE”) district. See PX084 § IV.7.b \n(requiring both congressional and SBOE district plans to respect “[t]he integrity of \ncommunities of interest”); PX001 fig. 1. But under the 2011 Plan, that region is \ncarved  among  three,  or  even  four  congressional  districts,  depending  on  one’s \nselection among competing understandings of the region’s contours. PX001 figs. 4, \n10. The Illustrative Plans, by contrast, largely unite the Black Belt region within \nDistrict 2, a district which would provide―for the first time―African-American \nvoters in the Black Belt region the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.  \nDefendant  will  offer  little  to  combat  Plaintiffs’  showing  under  the  first \nprecondition’s compactness criterion. Attempting to pull threads, Defendant and his \nexperts pick and choose the criteria on which they allege Plaintiffs’ plans fare worse \n \n- 13 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 21 of 46\n \nthan the 2011 Plan. “But districting is hardly a science,” and “there is more than one \nway to draw a district so that it can reasonably be described as meaningfully adhering \nto traditional principles, even if not to the same extent or degree as some other \nhypothetical district.” Chen v. City of Houston, 206 F.3d 502, 519 (5th Cir. 2000). \nFor  instance,  Defendant’s  expert  criticizes  Plaintiffs’  Illustrative  Plans  based \nexclusively on visual inspection of the districts’ shapes―exactly the sort of analysis \ncourts have long rejected in the context of a Section 2 claim. Dillard v. Baldwin Cty. \nBd. of Educ., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1465–66 (M.D. Ala. 1988) (“An aesthetic norm, \nby itself, would be not only unrelated to the legal and social issues presented under \n§ 2, it would be an unworkable concept, resulting in arbitrary and capricious results, \nbecause  it  offers  no  guidance  as  to  when  it  is  met.”).  Moreover,  Defendant’s \ncontention that Plaintiffs’ plans retain less of the “core” of the current districts is a \nred herring: where Plaintiffs are specifically tasked with drawing a new majority-\nminority district under the first precondition, they can hardly be faulted for failing \nto retain prior unlawful districts. See PX059 ¶¶ 21–22. \nContrary to Defendant’s likely suggestion, “[t]he first Gingles precondition \ndoes not require some aesthetic ideal of compactness.” Houston, 56 F.3d at 611 \n(quoting Clark v. Calhoun Cty., Miss., 21 F.3d 92, 95 (5th Cir. 1994)). Instead, \nbecause  Plaintiffs’  illustrative  majority-minority  districts  are  consistent  with \n \n- 14 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 22 of 46\n \ntraditional districting principles, they satisfy the first Gingles precondition. \n2.  Gingles 2 and 3: African Americans in Central and \nSouthern Alabama Are Politically Cohesive and the White \nMajority Votes as a Bloc Usually to Defeat African-\nAmerican Candidates of Choice \nThe second and third Gingles preconditions together ask whether racial bloc \nvoting in the region usually results in the defeat of minority-preferred candidates. \nHere, it most certainly does.  \nPlaintiffs will establish the second Gingles precondition by showing that “a \nsignificant  number  of  minority  group  members  usually  vote  for  the  same \ncandidates,” and the third Gingles precondition by showing “a white bloc vote that \nnormally  []  defeat[s]  the  combined  strength  of  minority  support  plus  white \n‘crossover’ votes rises to the level of legally significant white bloc voting.”  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 56. Because “[t]he amount of white bloc voting that can generally \n‘minimize  or  cancel’  black  voters’  ability  to  elect  representatives  of  their \nchoice . . . will vary from district to district,” no specific threshold percentage is \nrequired to demonstrate bloc voting. Id. (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Maxwell Palmer, will testify that African Americans in \ncentral and southern Alabama vote cohesively in support of the same candidates, and \nthat the white majority votes as a bloc usually to defeat their candidates of choice.  \nComparing  results  for  congressional  and  statewide  races  in  general  elections \n \n- 15 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 23 of 46\n \nbetween 2012 and 2018 with voter registration data and voter files, Dr. Palmer \napplied  a  statistical  procedure  known  as  ecological  inference  to  estimate  the \npercentage of each  racial group that voted for each candidate in each election \nexamined in the counties either wholly or partially within CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7, which \nhe refers to as the “Focus Area.” PX079 ¶¶ 8, 10–13, 25.6  \nWith respect to the second precondition, as Defendant concedes, “African \nAmericans in the Focus Area vote cohesively for their candidates of choice.” SF \n¶ 104.  Dr.  Palmer’s  county-level  analysis  shows  that  between  2012  and  2018 \nAfrican-American voters in the Focus Area supported the same candidates at an \naverage rate of 94.1%. SF ¶ 102; PX079 ¶ 20. Under his precinct-level analysis, the \nrate was 98.3%. SF ¶ 103; PX079 ¶ 35. Dr. Palmer’s analysis establishes that a \n“significant number” of African Americans in the Focus Area “usually vote for the \nsame candidates,” satisfying the second precondition. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56; see \nid. at 59 (second precondition satisfied where 71% to 92% of African Americans \nvoted for the same candidates); LULAC, 548 U.S. at 427 (92% cohesion). \n                                                 \n6  Courts  have  recognized  ecological  inference  as  an  appropriate  analysis  for \ndetermining  whether  a  plaintiff  has  satisfied  the  second  and  third  Gingles \npreconditions. See, e.g., Patino v. City of Pasadena, 230 F. Supp. 3d 667, 691 (S.D. \nTex. 2017); Benavidez v. City of Irving, Tex., 638 F. Supp. 2d 709, 723–24 (N.D. \nTex. 2009); Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 336 F. Supp. 2d 976, 1003 (D.S.D. 2004), aff’d \n461 F.3d 1011 (8th Cir. 2006). \n \n \n- 16 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 24 of 46\n \nAs  for  the  third  precondition,  and  as  Defendant  also  concedes, in  every \nelection  Dr.  Palmer  analyzed,  African-American  and  white  voters  cohesively \nsupported  opposing  candidates.  SF  ¶ 106.  Dr.  Palmer  found  that  white  voters \nsupported the African-American-preferred candidate at an average rate of just 16.7% \n(county-level) and 17.4% (precinct-level).  SF ¶¶ 107–08; PX079 ¶¶ 20, 35. Indeed, \nthe average difference in support for the African-American-preferred candidate in \nthe Focus Area was 80.9 percentage points, with comparable disparities in each of \nthe examined districts. SF ¶¶ 109–113; PX079 ¶ 36. The outcome produced by this \nracially  polarized  voting  was  stark.  In  every  single  congressional  election \nexamined―except for those in CD 7, the State’s only majority-African-American \ndistrict—the white majority voted “as a bloc . . . to defeat the minority’s preferred \ncandidate,” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. See PX079 ¶ 38. In statewide races, the white-\npreferred candidate defeated the African-American-preferred candidate in the Focus \nArea 16 of 18 times. SF ¶ 114; PX079 ¶ 23.7 And in every congressional and \nstatewide election, the white-preferred candidate defeated the African-American-\npreferred candidate in CDs 1, 2, and 3.

The  Totality  of  the  Circumstances  Shows  That  the  2011  Plan \nDilutes African-American Voting Strength \nOnce the preconditions are met, the Court examines whether the “totality of \ncircumstances” demonstrates vote dilution. Fayette Cty., 775 F.3d at 1342. “[I]t will \nbe only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of \nthe three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of Section 2 \nunder the totality of the circumstances.” Id. at 1342 (quoting Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135). \nIn fact, in a case where the Gingles preconditions are met but the court determines \nthe totality of the circumstances does not show vote dilution, “the district court must \nexplain with particularity why it has concluded, under the particular facts of that \ncase, that an electoral system that routinely results in white voters voting as a bloc \nto defeat the candidate of choice of a politically cohesive minority group is not \nviolative of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.” Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135. \nWhile “[n]o formula for aggregating the [Senate F]actors applies in every \ncase,” Marengo Cty., 731 F.2d at 1574, courts have set forth guidance regarding their \ncomparative weight. “[T]he most important Senate Report factors . . . are the ‘extent \nto  which  minority  group  members  have  been  elected  to  public  office  in  the \njurisdiction’ and the ‘extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political \n \n- 18 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 26 of 46\n \nsubdivision is racially polarized.’” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 n.15 (citation omitted). \n“Indeed, courts have found vote dilution based solely on the existence of these two \nfactors.” Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1325. And while the presence of the other \nSenate  factors  might  be  supportive  of  a  vote  dilution  challenge,  they  are  “not \nessential to” such a claim. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 n.15.  \nThis is not a “very unusual case.” The trial evidence will show that the most \nimportant factors (2 and 7) are clearly met, and all other relevant factors also weigh \nin Plaintiffs’ favor. Marengo Cty., 731 F.3d at 1574 (reversing finding of no dilution \nwhere none of the factors “substantial[ly] weigh[ed] in favor of the defendants”). \nSenate Factor 1: Alabama’s History of Official Discrimination \n“Alabama has a lengthy and infamous history of racial discrimination in \nvoting.” United States v. McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1346 (M.D. Ala. 2011). \n“[F]rom . . . 1901 to the present, the State of Alabama has consistently devoted its \nofficial  resources  to  maintaining  white  supremacy  and  a  segregated  society.”  \nDillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1360 (M.D. Ala. 1986) (quoting \nUnited States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. 95, 101 (M.D. Ala. 1966)). This centuries-\nlong pattern of discrimination, which persists through present day, continues to deny \nAfrican Americans equal participation in the political process. Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. \nPeyton McCrary, will testify regarding Alabama’s history of voting-related racial \ndiscrimination.  Defendant  has  not  disclosed  any  expert  prepared  to  rebut  Dr. \n \n- 19 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 27 of 46\n \nMcCrary’s testimony or opinions. \nDr. McCrary will testify about persistent efforts by Alabama politicians to \nprevent African Americans from participating equally—if at all—in the political \nprocess, and the brutal violence that has accompanied these efforts. For example, the \ndrafters of Alabama’s current Constitution were guided primarily by an intent “to \nestablish white supremacy in this State.” Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 229 \n(1985); see PX081 ¶ 13. The founders of the Constitution crafted devices designed \nto prevent African Americans from voting: a literacy test, employment requirements, \nproperty qualifications, a cumulative poll tax, and a ban on voting by those convicted \nof minor crimes. PX081 ¶¶ 14, 15. These devices had a devastating impact on the \nAfrican-American electorate: between 1900 and 1903, the number of black residents \nregistered to vote in this State dropped from 181,000 to 3,000. Id. ¶ 16. \nAgainst this backdrop, the past century has seen the State consistently warp \nits electoral procedures in response to court rulings in order to maintain white control \nof its political system. For example, after the Supreme Court invalidated white-only \nprimaries, Alabama amended its Constitution to add an “understanding requirement” \ngiving registrars broad discretion to reject African Americans’ attempts to register \nto vote. Id. ¶ 18. After that provision was invalidated, the State re-imposed a literacy \ntest to achieve the same goal. Id. ¶¶ 20, 21. Simultaneously, counties began holding \n \n- 20 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 28 of 46\n \nat-large elections, preventing African Americans—outnumbered by white voters—\nfrom electing their candidates of choice. Id. Recognizing that African-American \nvoters could nonetheless consolidate their support behind a single candidate, the \nState enacted in 1951 a law prohibiting “single shot voting” in municipal elections. \nId. ¶ 23; City of Rome v. United States, 446  U.S. 156, 184 n.19 (1980) (“Single-shot \nvoting enables a minority group to win some at large seats if it concentrates its vote \nbehind a limited number of candidates and if the vote of the majority is divided \namong a number of candidates.”). In 1961, Alabama required all at-large elections \nin the State to utilize “numbered places,” similarly preventing African Americans \nfrom consolidating their voting power behind one candidate. PX081 ¶¶ 24, 27; see \nCity of Rome, 446 U.S. at 185 n.21 (numbered-post systems “separate[] one contest \ninto a number of individual contests” to the detriment of minority voters). Officials \nalso often engaged in more targeted discrimination: in 1957, for example, the State \nredrew the City of Tuskegee’s boundaries to exclude African-American voters, \ngiving only white residents the ability to vote in municipal elections. Gomillion v. \nLightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960).  \nIn 1965, after national coverage of Dallas County officials’ violent attacks \nagainst voting-rights advocates on “Bloody Sunday” gave the country a glimpse of \nthe State’s fierce resistance to minority voting rights, President Johnson introduced \n \n- 21 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 29 of 46\n \nand ultimately signed the VRA. Despite that law’s protections, Alabama continued \nto engage in practices meant to deny African Americans political equality. Between \n1965 and 1982, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) objected 58 times \nto proposed changes to election practices or procedures in Alabama on the basis that \nthey infringed upon minority voting rights, and it sent election observers to the State \non 107 occasions. PX081 ¶ 31. Between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objected to 46 such \nchanges and sent federal observers 91 times. Id. ¶ 33. Federal courts during this time \nalso repeatedly found that Alabama jurisdictions had intentionally diluted African-\nAmerican voting strength. See Brown v. Bd. of Sch. Comm’rs of Mobile Cty., Ala., \n706 F.2d 1103 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding the City of Mobile’s at-large elections were \nthe result of intentional discrimination); Buskey v. Oliver, 565 F. Supp. 1473 (M.D. \nAla. 1983) (finding the City of Montgomery’s districts intentionally discriminatory); \nsee also Hale Cty., Ala. v. United States, 496 F. Supp. 1206 (D.D.C. 1980); Harris \nv. Graddick, 593 F. Supp. 128, 133 (M.D. Ala. 1984); Dillard, 640 F. Supp. 1347. \nAfter both the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, DOJ objected to districting plans \nproposed  by  the  State  because  they  diluted  African-American  voting  strength. \nPX081 ¶¶ 37–38. Notably, after litigation forced the State to create its first majority-\nminority congressional district in 1992, DOJ objected to a resulting plan because it \npacked African-American voters into one district and “fragmented” others among \n \n- 22 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 30 of 46\n \nthe rest. PX104 at 1–2. To ameliorate that fragmentation, DOJ suggested that the \nState adopt a plan strikingly similar to what Plaintiffs’ propose here: “one district \nbased on the black communities of Montgomery and Mobile Counties, and the other \nbased upon the black population of Jefferson County and southern Tuscaloosa \nCounty, together with black-populated areas to the south and west.” Id. at 2.  \nIn the last decade, Alabama officials have continued to block equal access to \nthe political process. In 2010, Alabama state senators schemed to depress black \nturnout by keeping a referendum issue off an upcoming ballot. McGregor, 824 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1345. The officials referred to African Americans as “Aborigines” and \njoked that if the issue were on the ballot, “[e]very black, every illiterate would be \nbused on HUD financed buses” to vote. Id. This prompted a federal judge to despair:  \nIn an era when the degree of racially polarized voting in the South is \nincreasing, not decreasing, Alabama remains vulnerable to politicians \nsetting an agenda that exploits racial differences. The[se statements] \nrepresent compelling evidence that political exclusion through racism \nremains a real and enduring problem in this State. Today, . . . it is still \nclear that such [racist] sentiments remain regrettably entrenched in the \nhigh echelons of state government. \nId. at 1347. \n  Even  more  recently,  the  Supreme  Court’s  invalidation  of  the  VRA’s \npreclearance formula catalyzed the State’s discriminatory tactics. Immediately after \nShelby County, Ala. v. Holder was issued, for example, Defendant Merrill began \nenforcing a voter-ID law that disproportionately burdens African-American voters. \n \n- 23 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 31 of 46\n \nPX081 ¶ 36. Soon after, the State closed 31 driver’s license offices in African-\nAmerican communities, making it more difficult for American Americans to acquire \nthe identification necessary to vote. Id. And less than six months after Shelby County, \nthe City of Evergreen consented to being “bailed-in” for preclearance under Section \n3(c) of the VRA because its voter registrars and election officials unconstitutionally \ndiscriminated against African-American voters. Allen v. City of Evergreen, Ala., No. \n13-cv-107-CG-M, 2014 WL 12607819 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 13, 2014).8 \nIn  short,  “[t]he  intersection  of  political  strategy  and  purposeful  racial \nprejudice” in Alabama “is nothing new.” McGregor, 284 F. Supp. 2d at 1347. This \nhistory has, and will continue to have, a lasting effect on African Americans’ ability \nto participate in the political process on an equal basis. Thus, the evidence on this \nfactor will weigh heavily in favor of Plaintiffs’ vote dilution claim. \nSenate Factor 2: Racially Polarized Voting \n“Although  no  factor  is  indispensable,  .  .  .  racially  polarized  voting  will \nordinarily be the keystone of a dilution case.” McMillan v. Escambia Cty., Fla., 748 \nF.2d 1037, 1043 (Former 5th Cir. 1984). With respect to Senate Factor 2, Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n8 Section 3(c) is a “rarely used” and powerful form of relief, N.C. State Conf. of \nNAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d 204, 241 (4th Cir. 2016), allowing a court to mandate \nthat a jurisdiction obtain preclearance from federal authorities before implementing \nany change in voting practice or procedure. 52 U.S.C. § 10302(c).  \n \n- 24 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 32 of 46\n \nincorporate by reference Section III.A.2, supra, regarding the second and third \nGingles preconditions. \nSenate  Factor  3:  Use  of  Voting  Practices  or  Procedures  That \nEnhance the Opportunity for Discrimination \nAs discussed in Section III.B.1, supra, Alabama has utilized various practices \nand procedures specifically intended to dilute African-American voting strength. \nThese  include  at-large  elections,  anti-single  shot  voting  laws,  numbered-place \nrequirements, and majority-vote requirements.  Even today, Alabama runs statewide \nat-large elections for seats on its Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, and \nCourt of Civil Appeals. SF ¶ 136. And the State continues to impose a majority-vote \nrequirement in its primary elections. SF ¶ 137. The undisputed evidence on this \nfactor therefore weighs heavily in favor of vote dilution. \nSenate Factor 4: Exclusion from Slating Process \nBecause there is no slating process involved in Alabama’s congressional \nelections, SF ¶ 138, this factor has no relevance to Plaintiffs’ claim.  \nSenate Factor 5: Effects of Discrimination \nThe  pervasive  discrimination  African  Americans  in  Alabama  have \nexperienced—which, for most of the State’s history “manifested . . . in practically \nevery area of political, social and economic life”—has caused persistent disparities \nbetween the day-to-day lives of African Americans and white residents in the State. \n \n- 25 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 33 of 46\n \nPX081 ¶¶ 11, 55. Defendant has conceded that there are severe disparities between \nAfrican-American and white Alabamians in the areas of income and poverty, SF \n¶¶ 139–143; educational attainment, SF ¶¶ 144–45; employment, SF ¶¶ 146–47; \nhousing,  SF  ¶¶ 148,  150;  access  to  a  vehicle,  SF  ¶ 149;  and  health  insurance \ncoverage, SF ¶ 151; see also PX001 ¶ 102.9   \nThese  disparities  have  diminished  political  participation  among  African \nAmericans in Alabama. Indeed, Defendant’s own expert has found that since 2010, \nthe statewide turnout rate among African-American voters has been, on average, \n4.8% lower than that of white voters. Def.’s Exh. 11 tbl. 7; see SF ¶ 154. Where \n“disproportionate  educational,  employment,  income  level  and  living \nconditions . . . are shown and where the level of black participation in politics is \ndepressed, plaintiffs need not prove any further causal nexus between their disparate \nsocio-economic status and the depressed level of political participation.” Wright v. \nSumter Cty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, 301 F. Supp. 3d 1297, 1320 (M.D. Ga. \n2018) (internal quotation marks omitted); McMillan, 748 F.2d at 1044 (same). And \neven though Defendant has disclosed no evidence that could make such a showing, \n                                                 \n9 Defendant’s only response to this evidence is to suggest that similar disparities \nexist in other states. Even if true, that fact is completely irrelevant to the analysis \nbefore the Court. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (requiring “an intensely local appraisal \nof the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanism[]” (emphases \nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \n \n- 26 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 34 of 46\n \nDr.  McCrary  will  explain  that  those  with  lower  household  income  or  lower \neducational achievement are less likely to vote or engage politically because the \nburdens of doing so are much higher for them compared to those with greater wealth \nand educational achievement. PX081 ¶ 56. In fact, “it is well established that an \nindividual’s education level is the single best indicator of whether that individual \nwill vote.” Id.  \nSenate Factor 6: Racial Appeals in Campaigns \nThe sixth Senate Factor examines whether Alabama’s elections have been \ncharacterized by “overt or subtle racial appeals.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 37 (quoting S. \nRep.  at  28–29).  Racial  appeals  can  take  a  variety  of  forms,  from  candidates’ \nidentification of their own ethnicity, see United States v. Alamosa Cty. Colo., 306 F. \nSupp. 2d 1016, 1025-26 (D. Colo. 2004), to the use of racially charged campaign \nissues, see Goosby v. Town Bd. of Town of Hempstead, N.Y., 956 F. Supp. 326, 342 \n(E.D.N.Y. 1997) (finding Senate Factor 6 established where campaign literature \npreyed on fears that African-American students would be bused to town schools and \nwarned of urban encroachment from New York City). \nRacial appeals are all too common in Alabama. Plaintiffs’ witnesses will \ntestify about such appeals and the effect they have on Alabama’s politics. For \ninstance, in 2011, Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks told residents at a town hall \nmeeting that he would do anything short of shooting undocumented immigrants in \n \n- 27 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 35 of 46\n \norder to remove them from the United States. Just a few years later, Brooks again \nresorted to racial appeals by asserting on national television that President Barack \nObama was leading a “war on whites.” He repeated a similar assertion in 2017 on a \nlocal Alabama radio show. The campaign preceding the 2017 special election for \nAlabama’s U.S. Senate seat also included explicit racial appeals. Candidate Roy \nMoore complained about civil rights protections implemented in this country in \n1965, the year the VRA was enacted. When asked to name a time that he believed \nAmerica was great, Moore pointed to this country’s pre-civil war era, stating that \neven though African Americans were enslaved, he thought that families were united. \nThe candidates who ultimately won the highest positions in the State’s judicial \nand executive branches in 2018 also engaged in racial appeals. Alabama Supreme \nCourt Justice Tom Parker’s campaign for Chief Justice ran a television ad warning \nof “an invasion” of the State coupled with videos of what appear to be dark-skinned \nimmigrants and a statement that Parker stood up for what “we” believe, and stood \nfor “us.” PX085. He also ran an ad touting the fact that he had “taken on and beaten” \nthe ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center, organizations whose mission is to \nprotect the civil rights of racial and ethnic minorities. PX086. At the same time, Kay \nIvey  made  the  preservation  of  confederate  monuments  a  centerpiece  of  her \ngubernatorial campaign. See Jordan v. Winter, 604 F. Supp. 807, 813 n.8 (N.D. Miss. \n \n- 28 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 36 of 46\n \n1984) (describing as a racial appeal a white candidate’s campaign ad with the slogan \n“He’s one of us” and showing videos of Confederate monuments).  \nAs Plaintiffs’ witnesses will testify, such racial appeals divide the electorate \nalong racial lines, spark animosity, and capitalize upon unfounded fears based on \nracial stereotypes.  \nSenate Factor 7: Extent to Which African Americans Have Been \nElected to Office \nThis factor considers “the extent to which members of the minority group have \nbeen elected to public office in the jurisdiction.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 37 (quoting S. \nRep. at 28–29). As Defendant concedes, Alabama has never had more than one \nAfrican-American congressional representative―and no African American since \nReconstruction has been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives outside of CD \n7. SF ¶ 156. No African American has ever been elected to the U.S. Senate from \nAlabama,  and  there  are  currently  no  African-American  statewide  officials.  SF \n¶¶ 157, 158. In fact, just two African Americans have ever been elected to statewide \noffice in Alabama, both of whom won as incumbents running for reelection after \nfirst being appointed. SF ¶ 159. Finally, the “overwhelming majority” of African-\nAmerican representatives in the Alabama Legislature come from majority-minority \ndistricts. SF ¶ 160. In short, Senate Factor 7 weighs strongly in favor of vote dilution.  \n*  *  * \n \n- 29 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 37 of 46\n \nThe evidence cited above with respect to the Senate Factors are matters of \nobjective, historical fact, that vast majority of which Defendant does not dispute. At \ntrial, Plaintiffs’ fact witnesses will illuminate these cold hard facts by sharing their \nown experiences regarding race relations and voting discrimination. Together, the \nevidence will demonstrate that the 2011 Plan “interacts with social conditions” in \nAlabama “to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white \nvoters to elect their preferred candidates.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47. \nIV.  Responses to Anticipated Arguments by Defendant \nRather  than  present  evidence  rebutting  Plaintiffs’  showing  under  the \napplicable  legal  standard  for  Section  2  claims,  Defendant  will  attempt  to  foist \nadditional legal burdens on Plaintiffs, suggesting Plaintiffs must prove something in \naddition to the Gingles preconditions and the totality of the circumstances test set \nforth above. Any such argument fails on both the law and the facts. \nA.  Racial Gerrymandering \nDefendant will likely contend that Plaintiffs’ plans fail Gingles 1 because they \nconstitute  “racial  gerrymanders.”  This  argument  squarely  contradicts  governing \nSection 2 case law. As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, racial gerrymandering \ncases and Section 2 cases “address very different contexts.” Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425. \n“The question under the first prong of Gingles in a § 2 case of whether the district \nwas created ‘consistent with traditional districting principles’ is distinct from” the \n \n- 30 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 38 of 46\n \nquestion posed in racial gerrymandering cases “of whether in drawing district lines \ntraditional districting principles were ‘subordinated to racial objectives.’” Fayette \nCty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1307 (quoting Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425). Thus, “based on \nthe directives of the Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit,” a district court \nadjudicating a State’s Section 2 liability “considers only the first question.” Id. \nDefendant’s conflation of the Section 2 and racial gerrymandering doctrines \nignores  that  “the  Supreme  Court  and  Eleventh  Circuit’s  ‘precedents  require \nplaintiffs to show that it would be possible to design an electoral district, consistent \nwith traditional districting principles, in which minority voters could successfully \nelect a minority candidate.’” Id. at 1306 (quoting Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425). In other \nwords, “[t]he intentional creation of a majority-minority district necessarily requires \nconsideration of race.” Ga. State Conf. of NAACP v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, \n118  F.  Supp.  3d  1338,  1345 (N.D.  Ga.  2015)  (emphasis  added).  “To  penalize \n[Plaintiffs] . . . for attempting to make the very showing that Gingles . . . demand[s] \nwould be to make it impossible, as a matter of law, for any plaintiff to bring a \nsuccessful  Section  Two  claim.”  Davis,  139  F.3d  at  1425.  As  a  result,  courts \nadjudicating a Section 2 claim should “not determine as part of the first Gingles \ninquiry whether Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plan[s] subordinate[] traditional redistricting \nprinciples to race.” Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1306. \n \n- 31 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 39 of 46\n \nWhether any particular district is a racial gerrymander becomes relevant only \nafter liability has been established, when the Court determines the proper remedial \nplan. Montes v. City of Yakima, 40 F. Supp. 3d 1377, 1401 (E.D. Wash. 2014) (“If \nDefendants believe that the present proposal cannot pass muster under the Equal \nProtection  Clause,  they  may  raise  that  issue  during  the  remedial  phase  of  the \nproceedings.”). Of course, the Court is under no obligation to use a plaintiff’s \nproposed plan when choosing a remedy. Clark, 21 F.3d at 95 (“[P]laintiffs’ proposed \ndistrict is not cast in stone. It was simply presented to demonstrate that a majority-\nblack district is feasible in [the jurisdiction].”).10 Accordingly, any assertion by \nDefendant at this stage in this litigation that a particular illustrative plan is a racial \ngerrymander is not ripe for review because liability has not yet been established.11 \nAnd notwithstanding the fundamental flaws in Defendant’s legal theory, Mr. Cooper \nwill testify that race did not predominate in his drawing of the Illustrative Plans. \nRather, race was one of a host of considerations he applied when drawing plans to \nsatisfy Gingles 1 consistent with traditional districting principles. PX001 ¶¶ 51–52. \n                                                 \n10 At the remedial stage, so long as the new majority-minority district does not \n“override  all  other  traditional  districting  principles  any  more  than  reasonably \nnecessary to remedy the violation,” that remedy district is permissible. Sanchez v. \nColorado, 97 F.3d 1303, 1327 (10th Cir. 1996). \n \n11 Notably, this Court has already denied Plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief and \nthe adoption of a remedial plan. See ECF No. 52.  \n \n- 32 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 40 of 46\n \nIn any event, even if one assumed “for the sake of argument that [a] proposed \nredistricting plan must survive strict scrutiny under an equal protection analysis \nbecause it favors race over all other traditional districting criteria, that does not \npreclude a finding of liability for a § 2 violation” because “it is possible that a district \ncreated to comply with § 2 that uses race as the predominant factor in drawing \ndistrict  lines  may  survive  strict  scrutiny.”  Montes,  40  F.  Supp.  3d  at  1400–01 \n(quoting Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1306). After all, “a majority of the Supreme \nCourt has assumed that the need to remedy a Section Two violation itself constitutes \na compelling state interest” sufficient to justify race-based redistricting. Davis, 139 \nF.3d at 1425 n.23. In other words, even if racial predominance were relevant to the \nSection 2 inquiry (it is not), and even if race did predominate in the drawing of the \nIllustrative Plans (it did not), the Equal Protection Clause imposes no bar on race-\nbased redistricting where it is done pursuant to the compelling state interest of \ncomplying with Section 2. See Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d at 1305–06. \nB.  Functionality of Illustrative Districts \nAs explained above, Gingles 1 does not require Plaintiffs to establish that their \nillustrative  majority-minority  districts  will  in  fact  elect  minority-preferred \ncandidates; they need only show an opportunity to elect. See supra Section III.A.1.a. \nIn any event, here it is beyond dispute that Districts 2 and 7 under the Illustrative \nPlans would provide an opportunity for African Americans to elect their candidates \n \n- 33 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 41 of 46\n \nof their choice. After analyzing seven contested statewide races in the most recent \ngeneral election, Dr. Palmer found that African Americans’ candidates of choice \nreceived at least 58% of the vote in Districts 2 and 7 under each of the Illustrative \nPlans, with African Americans comprising a majority of actual voters in each of \nthese districts. PX080 ¶¶ 8, 11. Defendant’s experts have offered no evidence that \nwould call these findings into question. See SF ¶¶ 162–64. \nC.  Race-Neutral Causes of Vote Dilution \nNor can Defendant import additional requirements for Plaintiffs’ showing \nunder Gingles 2 and 3. “[T]he legal concept of racially polarized voting, as it relates \nto claims of vote dilution, refers only to the existence of a correlation between the \nrace of voters and the selection of certain candidates,” and “[p]laintiffs need not \nprove causation or intent in order to prove a prima facie case of racial bloc voting \nand defendants may not rebut that case with evidence of causation or intent.” City of \nCarrollton Branch of N.A.A.C.P. v. Stallings, 829 F.2d 1547, 1557–58 (11th Cir. \n1987) (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 74 (plurality opinion)). In other words, the \nreasons why voters in the jurisdiction exhibit racially polarized voting is irrelevant \nto Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 63 (plurality opinion). It thus goes \nwithout saying that Plaintiffs are not required “to prove racism determines the voting \nchoices of the white electorate in order to succeed in a voting rights case.” Askew v. \nCity of Rome, 127 F.3d 1355, 1382 (11th Cir. 1997); Fayette Cty., 950 F. Supp. 2d \n \n- 34 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 42 of 46\n \nat  1321  n.29  (plaintiffs  “are  not  required  to  prove[]  racial  animus”  within  the \nelectorate). While “two judges of th[e Eleventh Circuit] consider racial bias in the \nvoting community to be a relevant factor,” Johnson v. Hamrick, 196 F.3d 1216, 1220 \n(11th Cir. 1999) (citing Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1524 (11th Cir. 1994) (en \nbanc) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.)), no majority of the court has endorsed this \nview. And even those two judges have not suggested that a plaintiff must show that \nracial bias is the source of racially polarized voting. Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1525 n.64 \n(explaining that a plaintiff “would be under no obligation to search [race-neutral \nexplanations for racially polarized voting] out and disprove them preemptively”). \nEven if racial bias in the electorate was relevant here, Defendant would have \n“the obligation to introduce evidence” and “affirmatively prove, under the totality \nof the circumstances, that racial bias does not play a major role in the political \ncommunity.” Id. at 1524–26 & nn.60, 64 (emphasis added); Fayette Cty., 950 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1321 (when “Plaintiffs have proved the Gingles factors, it is up to \nthe . . . Defendant[] to rebut Plaintiffs’ proof of vote dilution”). That is no small feat, \nas “proof of the second and third Gingles factors will ordinarily create a sufficient \ninference that racial bias is at work.” Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1525. In fact, the Eleventh \nCircuit has stated that “[t]he surest indication of race-conscious politics is a pattern \nof racially polarized voting.” Marengo Cty., 731 F.2d at 1567.  \n \n- 35 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 43 of 46\n \nD.  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \nDefendant will erroneously seek refuge in Section 5 of the VRA by arguing \nthat  in  adopting  the  2011  Plan,  Alabama  legislators  were  concerned  that  a \ncongressional  plan  with  two  majority-minority  districts  would  not  have  been \nprecleared. At the time the 2011 Plan was adopted, Alabama was subject to Section \n5’s preclearance regime, which would have prohibited the State from enacting a \ncongressional plan with “the effect of diminishing the ability of [African Americans] \nto elect their preferred candidates of choice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10304(b).  \nAs an initial matter, Section 5’s anti-retrogression principle cannot serve as a \ndefense to Plaintiffs’ claim. Because Plaintiffs are asserting an effects-based Section \n2 claim, the intent of those who drew the 2011 Plan is completely irrelevant. Fayette \nCty., 775 F.3d at 1342. Thus, it makes no difference whether those who drew the \n2011 Plan were concerned—correctly or incorrectly—that a plan with two majority-\nminority districts might not have passed preclearance. The good faith intent of the \nmapdrawers does not inoculate a claim under Section 2’s results test. \nBut even if Section 5 could serve as a defense to a Section 2 claim, the \nevidence at trial will demonstrate that Section 5 posed no obstacle to Alabama \nenacting a congressional plan with two majority-minority districts. As Dr. Palmer’s \nfunctionality analysis demonstrates, the creation of an additional majority-minority \ndistrict would have expanded―not diminished―African Americans’ opportunities \n \n- 36 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 44 of 46\n \nto elect their preferred candidates. SF ¶ 164; PX080 ¶¶ 8, 11. \nFor the same reason, Alabama’s choice to increase CD 7’s BVAP in the 2011 \nPlan from what it was in the 2001 Plan cannot be explained as an attempt to avoid \nretrogression. Between 2002 and 2010, African-American-preferred candidates won \nCD 7 by over 45 percentage points. PX087–091. Alabama did not need to maintain, \nlet alone increase, the BVAP in CD 7 to ensure that African Americans in that district \nwould continue to elect their candidates of choice. Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. \nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1272 (2015) (“Section 5 . . . does not require a covered \njurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage.”); id. at 1273 \n(criticizing Alabama’s “mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden \nretrogression”). “Nonretrogression is not a license for the State to do whatever it \ndeems necessary to ensure continued electoral success; it merely mandates that the \nminority’s opportunity to elect representatives of its choice  not be diminished, \ndirectly or indirectly, by the State’s actions.” Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 982–83 \n(1996). Alabama’s choice in 2011 to increase the concentration of African-American \nvoters in CD 7 thus had no connection to Section 5’s anti-retrogression requirement. \nV.  Conclusion \nThe evidence at trial will demonstrate that the 2011 Plan dilutes the voting \nstrength of African-American Alabamians in violation of Section 2 of the VRA. \n \n- 37 - \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 102   Filed 10/28/19   Page 45 of 46\n \nDated:  October 28, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  By /s/ Bruce V.

Introduction \n  The vast majority of the evidence that Plaintiffs offered at trial in this case \nwent unanswered. Instead of defending this case on the merits, Defendant offered \nirrelevant  and  legally  unsupported  arguments  that,  if  adopted,  would  radically \ntransform the well-settled framework governing Section 2 of  the Voting Rights Act \n(“VRA”). First, Defendant’s position that the Court should consider the legislative \nhistory behind the 2011 congressional plan (“2011 Plan”) when determining whether \nit currently dilutes minority voting strength fundamentally misunderstands how an \neffects-based claim operates under Section 2. Second, Defendant’s attempt to import \nthe racial gerrymandering doctrine into the context of a Section 2 claim has been \nthoroughly rejected by the Eleventh Circuit. Third, Defendant’s assertion that the \nvote dilution that results from the 2011 Plan can be dismissed as “politics as usual” \nignores both the legal standard and the role that race plays in Alabama’s politics. \n  The evidence presented at trial that was actually relevant to Section 2 made a \nclear case of unlawful vote dilution. With respect to the Gingles preconditions, \nPlaintiffs proved that (1) two majority-African-American congressional districts can \nbe drawn in central and southern Alabama, each containing a reasonably compact \nAfrican-American  population,  (2)  African-American  voters  in  that  area  vote \ncohesively, and (3) white voters in the area vote as a bloc usually to defeat the \n \n- 1 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 6 of 31\n \ncandidate preferred by African Americans. The totality of the circumstances of \nAlabama’s politics—and the undersized role African Americans play within it—\nconfirms  that  African  Americans  do  not  enjoy  an  equal  opportunity  to  elect \ncandidates of their choice in Alabama’s congressional elections.1 \nII.  Defendant’s arguments, if adopted, would fundamentally alter Section 2. \n  \nA.  The legislative history behind the current congressional plan is \nirrelevant to whether it currently results in unlawful vote dilution. \nThe question before this Court, and any court addressing a Section 2 effects \nclaim, is not what the State could have or should have done when the challenged \nplan was passed. Rather, it is whether the  plan “operates today to exclude [a minority \ngroup] from a fair chance to participate” in the relevant political system. Nipper v. \nSmith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1521-22 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, \nC.J.) (emphasis added) (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 36 (1982)). As Plaintiffs \nmaintained at trial, 1 Tr. 174:9-18; 3 Tr. 621:12-23; 4 Tr. 806:22, the process of \nenacting the plan—i.e., the plans that were submitted to and considered by the \nLegislature, hearsay statements from congressional representatives, or the intent of \nthe legislators who passed the plan—is irrelevant.  \n                                                 \n1 This brief highlights evidence and arguments not already discussed in Plaintiffs’ \nPre-Trial Brief. Plaintiffs thus incorporate their Pre-Trial Brief by reference. ECF \nNo. 102 (“Pls.’ Br.”). \n \n- 2 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 7 of 31\n \nIn  1982,  Congress  created  an  effects-based  claim  within  Section  2  as  a \nresponse to Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980), which “required proof of what \nwas in the minds of legislators who enacted or retained a voting law alleged to be \ndiscriminatory.” Solomon v. Liberty Cty., Fl., 899 F.2d 1012, 1026-27 (11th Cir. \n1990). Unlike the claim envisioned in Bolden, this effects-based claim asks only \n“whether[,] as a result of the challenged” map, Plaintiffs currently lack “an equal \nopportunity to participate in the political processes and to elect candidates of their \nchoice.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44. The reasons the plan was adopted are irrelevant. \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (explaining that Section 2 “prohibit[s] \nlegislation  that  results  in  the  dilution  of  a  minority  group’s  voting  strength, \nregardless of the legislature’s intent”); Hall v. Louisiana, 108 F. Supp. 3d 419, 425 \n(M.D. La. 2015) (“[The] ‘results test’ of Section 2 . . . focuses on objective facets of \nthe local political context instead of probing the minds of legislators.”).  \nDefendant’s assertion that Plaintiffs’ claim should fail because, among other \nreasons, Representative Sewell allegedly supported passage of the 2011 Plan or \nbecause only certain plans were proposed to the Committee, thus ignores that “a \ndiscriminatory result is all that is required” to prevail under Section 2. Ga. State \nConf. of NAACP v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 775 F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir. \n \n- 3 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 8 of 31\n \n2015).2 Under Defendant’s novel standard, a state’s compliance with Section 2 \nwould hinge on whether, at the time a given map is drawn, minority legislators \npropose the right maps and provide the right analysis in support of an additional \nmajority-minority district―notwithstanding their own desires as incumbents. See 3 \nTr. 604:25-605:3 (“[E]very elected official wants the best district for their election. \nThey’re  not  thinking  about  what’s  the  best  district  for  all  black  people . . .”) \n(Sanders). Nothing in Section 2 indicates Congress intended to foist upon any \nindividual  legislator,  regardless  of  their  race,  the  singular  responsibility  for \ndetermining what the VRA does and does not require whenever a new map is drawn.  \nThus, contrary to Defendant’s unsupported assertions, Section 2 neither asks \nwhy  the  Alabama  Legislature  failed  to  create  a  second  majority-minority \ncongressional district in 2011, nor provides a defense based on the assertion that it \nwould have been politically difficult to pass a plan with two such districts.3 Instead, \nit simply asks whether the map dilutes African Americans’ voting strength, even if \n                                                 \n2 To be sure, Representative Sewell supports Plaintiffs’ claim in this case. PX129. \n3 Similarly, Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plans would not have \nbeen precleared is a red herring. Legislators’ concerns about preclearance, well-\nfounded or not, offer no information about whether a given districting plan has a \ndilutive effect. \n \n \n- 4 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 9 of 31\n \nthat dilution is entirely inadvertent. The information considered by the Legislature \nat the time it drew the 2011 Plan therefore has no bearing on Plaintiffs’ claim.4 \nB.  Defendant’s racial gerrymandering defense defies Eleventh Circuit \nlaw and would render Section 2 inoperative. \nDefendant further attempts to distract from the actual Section 2 standard by \nalleging the Illustrative Plans are racial gerrymanders. ECF No. 101 (“Def.’s Br.”), \nat 5-12. But Defendant fails to identify a single case in which a court rejected a \nSection 2 claim because the plaintiff’s illustrative plan was drawn with too much \nfocus on race. Instead, “various courts,” including the Eleventh Circuit, “have held \nthat Section 2 plaintiffs in vote dilution cases are not required to show that their \nproposed plans comply with Miller v. Johnson to satisfy Gingles One.” Terrebonne \nParish Branch NAACP v. Jindal, 274 F. Supp. 3d 395, 428-29 (M.D. La. 2017) \n(citing Davis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1425 (11th Cir. 1998)). \n                                                 \n4 Contrary to Defendant’s suggestion, 1 Tr. 97:15-17, the Court considers 2010 \nCensus data under Gingles 1 not because it informs what “could have” been drawn \nin 2011 but because decennial Census data are presumptively reliable throughout the \ndecade. Dickinson v. Ind. State Election Bd., 933 F.2d 497, 503 (7th Cir. 1991) \n(census figures are “the relevant data for assessing a claim under Section [2]”); \nUnited States v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., No. 09-cv-80507-CIV, 2009 WL 3667071, \nat *3-4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 23, 2009); compare Johnson v. DeSoto Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, \n204 F.3d 1335, 1341-43 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding district court did not err in \nconsidering data post-dating challenged plan where defendant provided “competent \nevidence” to overcome the presumption of the  “continuing accuracy of census \nfigures”). \n \n \n- 5 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 10 of 31\n \nDefendant’s  entire  argument  relies  on  the  assertion  that  Plaintiffs  “must \ndemonstrate the existence of a proper remedy,” for which Defendant quotes Davis. \nDef.’s Br. at 5. But not only does Defendant take that quotation out of context, the \nDavis court expressly rejected Defendant’s exact argument. In Davis, the plaintiffs \nchallenged at-large judicial election systems and offered a Gingles illustrative plan \ncontaining a majority-minority district. 139 F.3d at 1416, 1418. The district court \nrejected the claim on two independent grounds. First, the defendants’ interests in \nmaintaining at-large judicial election systems outweighed the plaintiffs’ interest in a \ndistrict-based scheme. Id. at 1419. Second, plaintiffs’ proposed districts were racial \ngerrymanders.  Id.  The  Eleventh  Circuit  affirmed  only  the  first  ground  after \nconsidering “Florida’s interest in maintaining its Constitution’s judicial selection \nsystem in determining whether Davis has proposed a permissible remedy.” Id. at \n1421. As a result, the plaintiffs had not shown “the existence of a proper remedy.” \nId. at 1419. That is the statement that Defendant quotes. See Def.’s Br. at 5-6. \nWith regard to the second ground, the Eleventh Circuit found it “necessary \nand appropriate” to clarify that the district court had “misread the applicable law” \nby “attempt[ing] to apply [racial gerrymandering] authorities such as Miller to this \nSection Two case.” Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425. The racial gerrymandering doctrine \ndoes not apply to the first Gingles precondition, the court explained, because they \n \n- 6 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 11 of 31\n \n“address very different contexts”: while the former involves a challenge to excessive \nfocus on race, the latter requires a plaintiff to create a new district with a minimum \nminority population of 50%. Id. Applying the racial gerrymandering doctrine to \nSection 2 would “penalize [a plaintiff] . . . for attempting to make the very showing \nthat Gingles” demands, and “would . . . make it impossible, as a matter of law, for \nany plaintiff to bring a successful Section Two action.” Id. Thus, applying the racial \ngerrymandering doctrine to the first Gingles precondition “misinterpret[s] the law \nregarding the role of race in assessing permissible remedies for violations of Section \nTwo.” Id. at 1426.5 \n                                                 \n5 For this reason, the vast majority of the analyses performed by Defendant’s experts \nare irrelevant to this case. And in any event, the sheer number of courts that have \nrejected both experts’ opinions should give the Court pause before crediting their \ntestimony on any aspect of the case. See, e.g., Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Reagan, \n329 F. Supp. 3d 824, 837 (D. Ariz. 2018) (finding Dr. Hood’s analysis was “not \nuseful” and “reflected an incomplete understanding” and noting that “Dr. Hood’s \ntestimony has been rejected or given little weight in numerous other cases due to \nconcerns over its reliability”). In fact, every court before which Dr. Johnson has \ntestified has rejected some or all of his opinions. Common Cause v. Lewis, No. 18 \nCVS 014001, 2019 WL 4569584, at *95-96 (N.C. Sup. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019) (rejecting \nDr. Johnson’s “methodologies, analyses, and conclusions” because he had made “a \nseries of significant errors” and noting courts in all four of the previous cases in \nwhich he had testified “have rejected his analysis”); see also Luna v. Kent, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 1088, 1109 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (rejecting his communities-of-interest analysis \nin the only other Section 2 case in which Dr. Johnson has testified); Covington v. \nNorth Carolina, 283 F. Supp. 3d 410, 449 (M.D.N.C. 2018) (finding his racial \ngerrymandering analysis “unreliable and not persuasive”). Indeed, when asked about \n \n \n- 7 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 12 of 31\n \nDefendant’s reasoning illuminates the Eleventh Circuit’s concerns. Under \nDefendant’s wholly unsupported theory, the only scenario in which Section 2 applies \nis when a plan contains a district that is nearly majority-minority. Def.’s Br. at 10. \nAccording to Defendant, a new majority-minority district is permissible only when \nit entails tinkering “on the margins of the [existing] districts.” Id. But if that were \nthe standard, Section 2 would apply only when it is needed the least; a plan that \nseverely  cracks  a  minority  population  among  several  districts—like  the  one \nchallenged here—would be insulated from Section 2 review. As Davis makes clear, \nthat is not, and cannot be, the law. Thus, “[n]otwithstanding the polemics regarding \nrace-based redistricting that pervade [Defendant’s] brief to this [C]ourt,” the racial \ngerrymandering doctrine has no role in the Gingles preconditions. Davis, 139 F.3d \nat 1424-25.6  \n                                                 \nthe  Common  Cause  court’s  rejection  of  his  opinions,  Dr.  Johnson  responded \nuntruthfully. 5 Trial Tr. 1038:16-24. \n6 As explained in Plaintiffs’ Pre-Trial Brief, even if this Court were to ignore \nEleventh Circuit law and apply the racial gerrymandering doctrine in this case, \nDefendant’s argument would still fail. Pls.’ Br. at 33. Race did not predominate in \nthe Illustrative Plans because, as explained in Section III.A, each complies with \ntraditional redistricting principles. And even if race did predominate, it was justified \nby the compelling interest of complying with Section 2. Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425 \nn.23. Contrary to the Reapportionment Committee’s Guidelines referring to the \nVRA as a “compelling state interest,” PX084 § IV.7.d, Defendant appears to assert \n \n \n- 8 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 13 of 31\n \nC.  The cause of racially polarized voting is legally irrelevant, and, in \nany event, the undisputed evidence established a strong connection \nbetween partisanship and race in Alabama. \nPlaintiffs are not required to prove that the undisputed racially polarized \nvoting in the State results from particular racial attitudes. See Pls.’ Br. at 34-35. The \nGingles plurality explicitly held that the motivations of voters are irrelevant to \ndetermining whether racially polarized voting exists, and no majority of the Eleventh \nCircuit has ever imposed such a requirement. Id. Defendant asks this Court to create \na new legal standard requiring Section 2 plaintiffs to affirmatively demonstrate that \nindividual voters are driven by race. Def.’s Br. at 20-21. But this would be a near \nimpossible showing. This was a primary reason why Congress created the effects-\nbased claim under which Plaintiffs bring this suit: any required showing of intent on \nthe part of legislators or the public “is unnecessarily divisive because it involves \ncharges of racism on the part of individual officials or entire communities, [] places \nan  inordinately  difficult  burden  of  proof  on  plaintiffs,  and  []  asks  the  wrong \nquestion.”  Gingles,  478  U.S.  at  43-44  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citations \nomitted).  Instead,  whether  vote  dilution  is  “on  account  of  race  or  color”  is \ndetermined by the objective Senate Factors. Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524, 1526. \n                                                 \nthat Section 2 compliance is not a compelling state interest, Def.’s Br. at 8. No court \nhas ever taken that position; this Court should not be the first. \n \n- 9 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 14 of 31\n \nEven if the  motivations behind racially polarized voting were  a relevant \nconsideration, it is Defendant’s burden to prove that race is not a factor. Nipper, 39 \nF.3d at 1524-26 & nn.60, 64. Here, Defendant’s own expert testified he could not \nsupport that position; when asked whether, based on his research, he could say race \nis not a factor in voters’ choice of political parties, he answered, “No, certainly not.” \n5 Tr. 957:9-11 (Hood). Dr. Hood further testified that white southerners transitioned \nto the Republican party after passage of the VRA “primarily [as] a function of racial \nand political dynamics.” 5 Tr. 939:2-25; 940:7-10. In fact, the VRA was a “milestone \nin the development of the Republican Party in the south,” as the “increasingly liberal \norientation of the National Democratic Party on the issue of [c]ivil [r]ights affected \nwhite southerners.” 5 Tr. 940:11-18 (Hood); see also 2 Tr. 294:12-22; 295:2-8 \n(McCrary). It was “black mobilization [that] led directly to the transition of whites \nin[to] the Republican party,” which was “increasingly viewed as the party of racial \nconservatism.” 5 Tr. 940:25-941:6 (Hood); see also 3 Tr. 542:23-543:8 (Sanders) \n(“[T]he more active African-Americans became in the Democratic party, the more \nwhites began to go to the Republican party.”). And this is by no means a trend of the \npast. Dr. Hood testified that the partisan divide in recent elections was caused in part \nby race, as demonstrated by the “association between resentment of minority races \nand voting for President Trump.” 5 Tr. 936:1-4. According to Dr. Hood’s 2012 book \n \n- 10 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 15 of 31\n \non the topic, “a complete understanding of southern party politics requires a full \nappreciation for the role that race has played and continues to play in the region.” 5 \nTr. 957:12-17. \nPlaintiffs’ witnesses confirmed the significant role race plays in Alabama’s \nmodern partisan politics. Senator Sanders testified that he became a Democrat in \npart because “the Republican party seemed . . . adverse to the interests of black \npeople,” and that the same holds true today, though it may be expressed differently \nthan  in  the  past.  3  Tr.  540:19-23,  541:12-20.  Likewise,  Rep.  Knight  feels \n“comfortable within the Democratic party”—despite not agreeing with all of its \nviews—because the party is “as fair as it possibly can be when it comes to racial \nissues”; by contrast, he “ha[s] never felt welcome in the Republican party in the state \nof Alabama” because it seems “one-sided when it comes to racial justice.” 2 Tr. \n341:24-343:15. Ms. Chestnut put it even more plainly: as a black woman, she does \nnot feel welcome in the Republican party in Alabama because it is “hospitable to \nhate.” 2 Tr. 448:17-449:24.   \nIn  sum,  the  reasons  Alabamians  vote  in  a  racially  polarized  manner  are \nirrelevant to a Section 2 claim. But even if they were, Defendant utterly failed to \nmeet his burden to prove that race is not one of those reasons.  \n \n- 11 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 16 of 31\n \nIII.  Plaintiffs proved a violation of Section 2 of the VRA.  \nA.  Gingles 1 \nNumerousness.  Plaintiffs’  Illustrative  Plans  satisfy  the  Supreme  Court’s \nbright line rule governing the numerousness prong of the first Gingles precondition: \nin each, African Americans constitute more than 50% of the voting-age populations \nof CDs 2 and 7. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 18 (2009) (“Do minorities make \nup more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the relevant geographic \narea?”); see 1 Tr. 81-86 (Cooper); PX001 fig. 18; PX059 figs. 5, 7, 9. \nDefendant’s assertion that Plaintiffs use an incorrect metric to determine \nBVAP is both incorrect and irrelevant. As a legal matter, the Supreme Court has \ninstructed that in cases involving an examination of African-American vote dilution \nalone, rather than “a comparison of different minority groups,” courts should look at \n“all individuals who identify themselves as black,” regardless of whether they also \nidentify as another minority group. Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 473 n.1 \n(2003). That Defendant’s own experts cannot agree on the proper alternative metric, \nsee 5 Tr. 901:4-7 (Hood), 999:7-9 (Johnson), with neither proposing the metric \nactually used by the State, PX059 at 3 n.2; 5 Tr. 904:9-905:3 (Hood), 999:2-6 \n(Johnson), illustrates the logic behind the Supreme Court’s instruction. Indeed, it is \na cruel irony that, whereas throughout most of Alabama’s history the State enforced \n \n- 12 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 17 of 31\n \nan over-inclusive “one drop” metric to deny its citizens fundamental rights, 2 Tr. \n312:4-12 (McCrary), it now seeks to use an under-inclusive metric to deny African \nAmericans protections under the VRA.7 \nMost importantly, as a practical matter, Defendant’s quarrel over the proper \nBVAP metric is immaterial. As Dr. Hood agrees, and as Defendant has stipulated, \nat least two of the Illustrative Plans contain two majority-African-American districts \naccording to even the most restrictive metric. 5 Tr. 914:10-20; Joint List of Agreed \n& Disputed Principal Facts (“SF”), ECF No. 95, ¶ 86. \nFinally,  Plaintiffs  disproved  Defendant’s  irrelevant  assertion  that  the \nIllustrative Plans would not “function” as opportunity districts. See Pls.’ Br. at 10. \nEven if it were relevant, Plaintiffs offered unrefuted evidence that if any of the \nIllustrative  Plans  were  in  place  during  the  most  recent  congressional  election, \nAfrican Americans in illustrative CDs 2 and 7 not only would have been a majority \n                                                 \n7 To the extent Dr. Johnson claims to be using a metric adopted by U.S. Department \nof Justice, his trial testimony exhibited a blatant misunderstanding of the relevant \nguidelines.  The  DOJ  guidelines  describe  a  two-step  process  in  which  it  first \nexamines the single-race minority population, and then “move[s] to the second step” \nby allocating multi-race responses “on an iterative basis to each of the component \nsingle-race categories for analysis.” PX125 at 4. Contrary to the clear language of \nthese guidelines and their explicit citation to Footnote 1 in the Georgia v. Ashcroft \nopinion, Dr. Johnson believes that this second step is “a second method as an \noption.” 5 Tr. 1011:2.  \n \n- 13 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 18 of 31\n \nof the actual voters, but would have elected their candidates of choice by margins of \nat least 16 percentage points. 1 Tr. 178:21-179:9; PX080 ¶¶ 8, 11. Defendants’ \nexperts did not dispute these results: Dr. Hood agreed that CDs 2 and 7 in each plan \n“would function as African-American opportunity districts,” 5 Tr. 933:4-16, and Dr. \nJohnson did not “even read” Dr. Palmer’s analysis, 5 Tr. 998:12-14. \nCompactness. The African-American communities in CDs 2 and 7 of each \nIllustrative  Plan  are  geographically  compact  because  they  are  “consistent  with \ntraditional districting principles.” Davis, 139 F.3d at 1425; see Pls.’ Br. at 10-15. \nAs to nearly every relevant traditional redistricting principle, there is no \ndispute. The Illustrative Plans maintain population equality. 1 Tr. 20:1-5 (Cooper); \n5 Tr. 1033:22-24 (Johnson); SF ¶ 87; PX059 figs. 5, 7, 9; PX001 fig. 18. Their \ndistricts fall in the normal range of objective compactness scores. 1 Tr. 91:8-16 \n(Cooper);  5  Tr.  1022:10-21  (Johnson)  (noting  there  is  no  threshold  score  to \ndetermine sufficient compactness); PX001 ¶ 85; PX045; PX059 fig. 11. They also \nmaintain as many, and often more, traditional boundaries than the current plan. 1 Tr. \n20:22-21:2, 61:12-62:6, 64:6-12 (Cooper); PX059 fig. 12; 5 Tr. 1029:13-16, 1035:7-\n25 (Johnson); SF ¶¶  89-91. The Illustrative Plans are contiguous. 1 Tr. 20:15, 64:21-\n65:3 (Cooper); 5 Tr. 1035:14-17 (Johnson). And they do not create contests between \nincumbents. 1 Tr. 21:8-24, 68:4-6 (Cooper); 5 Tr. 1035:18-20 (Johnson); SF ¶ 88. \n \n- 14 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 19 of 31\n \nDefendant’s assertions that the Illustrative Plans do not preserve enough of \nthe  cores  of  existing  districts  is  a  distraction:  because  a  Section  2  plaintiff  is \nspecifically required to create a new majority-minority district, she can hardly be \nfaulted  for  failing  to  maintain  prior  unlawful  districts.  See  PX059  ¶¶  21-22. \nDefendant cannot identify a single case in which a proposed majority-minority \ndistrict has been rejected under Gingles 1 because it inadequately retained the core \nof existing districts, see 5 Tr. 921:15-922:2, and Dr. Johnson admitted that core \nretention usually decreases when a plan creates a new majority-minority district, id. \nat  1024:18-1025:8,  particularly  where  a  map  requires  more  than  a  “slight[] \nadjust[ment]” to fix the VRA violation, id. at 1025:5. \nUltimately,  the  parties  diverge  on  just  one  issue  in  relation  to  Gingles \ncompactness: whether placing the City of Mobile into CD 2 impermissibly separates \na community of interest. While the vast majority of Defendant’s evidence was in \nsupport of this one assertion, none of it negates Plaintiffs’ demonstration that the \nAfrican-American  population  in  southern  and  central  Alabama  is  reasonably \ncompact. First, Defendant’s assertion that the width of CD 1 in Plaintiffs’ Illustrative \nPlans would make it an inconvenient district to represent is legally irrelevant. The \nfirst  Gingles  precondition  asks  whether  the  majority-minority  districts  in  the \nillustrative plan comply with traditional redistricting principles, Gingles, 145 U.S. at \n \n- 15 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 20 of 31\n \n50,  and  CD  1  is  not  a  majority-minority  district  under  the  Illustrative  Plans. \nMoreover, the Guidelines do not recognize the ease of a congressmember’s travel as \na redistricting consideration. In any event, even if this argument were relevant, CD \n1 in the Illustrative Plans would be no more inconvenient to represent than current \nCDs 4 or 5, which are comparably compact and just as “broad geographically,” 4 Tr. \n689:19-21 (Byrne), as Illustrative CD 1. 1 Tr. 140:5-141:2 (Cooper); PX015; PX045.  \nDefendant essentially argues that any plan that separates the alleged economic \ncommunities contained in current CD 1 cannot sufficiently respect communities of \ninterest under Gingles 1. This argument fails for a host of reasons. It ignores that \nunder the Reapportionment Committee’s own Guidelines, “communities of interest” \nfalls at the bottom of a long list of factors to be considered in drawing a redistricting \nplan.  It  comes  after  population  equality,  preservation  of  county  boundaries, \ncompactness, contiguity, incumbent protection, and well after compliance with the \nVRA. See PX084. And the Guidelines instruct that communities of interest are to be \nrespected only “to the extent that they do not violate or subordinate [these other] \npolicies,” with “[p]riority . . . given” to the VRA. Id. §§ IV.7, IV.7.d. Moreover, \neconomic ties are just one of many interests that create a community; in fact, while \nthe Guidelines do not identify economic ties as such an interest, they explicitly \nrecognize many others, including common race or ethnicity. Id. § IV.7.d.  \n \n- 16 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 21 of 31\n \nEven assuming CD 1 currently contains an economic community of interest, \nthe Illustrative Plans unite geographic, cultural, racial and ethnic, regional, historic, \ngovernmental, and social communities of interest that the current plan divides. E.g., \n1 Tr. 65:16-20, 68:15-18 (Cooper); 3 Tr. 543:16-544:3 (Sanders); Pls.’ Br. at 13. \nThe African-American communities both within and near the Black Belt share an \nundisputable history of racial discrimination that continues to play an important role \ntoday. 3 Tr. 576:6-13 (Sanders) (“[Lynching and land confiscation] in our collective \nmemory is so powerful. . . . [I]t’s still there in a very powerful way.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ witnesses further explained that the Illustrative Plans unite African-\nAmerican communities with a wealth of similar interests and needs in the urban \ncenters of Mobile and Montgomery. Rep. Knight testified, for example, that during \nhis 25 years in the Alabama House he observed many of the same concerns from \nAfrican  Americans  in  Montgomery  and  Mobile  relating  to  education,  criminal \njustice reform, and healthcare—issues relevant to a wide swath of Alabamians, but \nwhich impact African Americans in unique ways. 2 Tr. 340:14-15, 340:24-341:8. As \nto  education,  Ms.  Chestnut  explained  that  Mobile’s  predominantly  African-\nAmerican public schools are failing. 2 Tr. 420:10-421:5, 421:6-421:22. Rep. Knight \nidentified the exact same issue in Montgomery. 2 Tr. 365:10-13; see also 1 Tr. \n220:25-221:15 (Jones); 2 Tr. 421:23-422:7 (Chestnut). Rep. Knight, Ms. Chestnut, \n \n- 17 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 22 of 31\n \nand Ms. Jones also described criminal justice issues facing African Americans in \nMobile and Montgomery, such as disproportionately high incarceration rates, 2 Tr. \n340:2-11 (Knight); 2 Tr. 423:25-424:5 (Chestnut); 1 Tr. 218:8-14 (Jones), police \nbrutality and strained relationships with law enforcement, 2 Tr. 423:1-25 (Chestnut); \n1 Tr. 222:19-224:9 (Jones), and reintegration of those leaving prison, 2 Tr. 424:6-19 \n(Chestnut); 1 Tr. 222:4-16 (Jones). They also spoke about the housing crises the \nAfrican-American communities face in both cities. 2 Tr. 427:6-14, 427:22-428:1 \n(Chestnut); 1 Tr. 225:13-226:2 (Jones); 2 Tr. 339:17-340:1 (Knight). And they \ndescribed similar employment issues facing African Americans. 1 Tr. 224:10-225:12 \n(Jones),  2  Tr.  354:22-357:25,  358:13-359:16  (Knight),  2  Tr.  424:20-425:24 \n(Chestnut). Similarly, the Illustrative Plans unite African-American communities \nwith common socioeconomic conditions. PX001 ¶ 102; PX051-59; Terrebonne \nParish, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 425 (finding minority population compact under Gingles \n1 in part because African-American residents in illustrative districts shared similar \nsocioeconomic characteristics as compared to whites). \nIndeed, the State has already recognized the communities of interests that the \nIllustrative Plans connect: the State Board of Education (“SBOE”) Plan, governed \nby the same Guidelines, PX084 at 1, unites the same communities. PX001 fig. 1; \nSF ¶¶ 80,  83.  Senator  Dial,  the  former  co-chairman  of  the  Reapportionment \n \n- 18 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 23 of 31\n \nCommittee, confirmed that the SBOE plan was drawn to respect “[t]he integrity of \ncommunities of interest.” 3 Tr. 646:10-13. So too do the Illustrative Plans. See \nTerrebonne Parish, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 425 (finding minority communities formed a \ncommunity of interest where they shared a district under other districting plans). \nAs the Guidelines acknowledge, “[i]t is inevitable. . . that some interests will \nbe advanced more than others by the choice of particular district configurations.” \nPX084 § IV.7.b; see also 3 Tr. 647:11-13 (Dial) (“[I]t’s not always possible to \nprotect communities of interest.”). Defendant asks this Court to hold Plaintiffs’ \nIllustrative Plans to a standard the Guidelines themselves recognize is impossible for \nany districting plan. While the State may choose to prioritize different communities \nof interest, its policy preference as to which communities deserve representation, \nand which do not, does not undermine Plaintiffs’ showing under Gingles 1.  \nB.  Gingles 2 and 3 \nWith respect to Gingles 2, Defendant stipulates that African-American voters \nin CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 vote cohesively. SF ¶ 104. Dr. Palmer offered unrebutted \nevidence confirming that fact. 1 Tr. 145:15-158:3, 169:11-170:7 (Palmer); PX079 \n¶¶ 13-21, 32-36. Dr. Hood had “no basis . . . to refute Dr. Palmer’s analysis of the \nextent to which African-Americans vote cohesively.” 5 Tr. 907:13-16, 898:1-4. \nAnd as for Gingles 3, Dr. Palmer offered unrebutted evidence that white voters \n \n- 19 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 24 of 31\n \nin the same area vote as a bloc usually to defeat the candidates preferred by African-\nAmerican voters. In the statewide races analyzed, white Alabamians voted as a bloc \n16 out of 18 times to defeat the candidate preferred by African Americans. 1 Tr. \n158:5-160:10 (Palmer); PX079 ¶¶ 22-24. And in congressional races outside of CD \n7, white Alabamians vote as a bloc to defeat all candidates preferred by African \nAmericans. 1 Tr. 172:4-10 (Palmer); PX079 ¶¶ 37-39. Again, Dr. Hood offered no \nbasis to refute Dr. Palmer’s conclusions. 5 Tr. 898:5-16; see also 5 Tr. 897:1-7.8 \nAs explained at greater length in Plaintiffs’ Pre-Trial Brief, see Pls.’ Br. at 15-\n18, this evidence easily satisfies the second and third Gingles preconditions. \nC.  Totality of the Circumstances \nThe purpose of Section 2’s totality of the circumstances test is to confirm what \nthe Gingles preconditions suggest: that Alabama’s congressional map “interacts with \nsocial and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed \nby black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.” Gingles, 478 U.S. \nat 47. The Senate Factors, which animate this test, identify specific aspects of day-\n                                                 \n8 To reach these conclusions, Dr. Palmer utilized ecological inference, a method that \nDr. Hood not only uses himself when analyzing racially polarized voting, but also \nthat Dr. Hood believes “provides the most reliable and realistic estimates of voter \nchoice” among “the current statistical tools that can be employed to aid in vote \ndilution analysis.” 5 Tr. 897:8-23. \n \n- 20 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 25 of 31\n \nto-day life that Congress has determined often impose barriers to a minority group’s \npolitical participation. At trial, Plaintiffs offered unrebutted evidence that all of the \nrelevant Senate Factors weigh heavily in favor of a finding of unlawful vote dilution. \nAs for the two factors the Supreme Court has recognized as most important—\nwhether voting is racially polarized (Factor 2) and the extent to which African \nAmericans have been elected to public office (Factor 7), see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48 \nn.15—the evidence was overwhelming. With respect to Factor 2, voting in CDs 1, \n2, 3, and 7 is not only racially polarized, but significantly so: nearly 95% of African \nAmericans vote for the same candidates, and nearly 85% of white voters support the \nopposing candidates. 1 Tr. 157:2-20, 158:1-4, 169:11-170:7 (Palmer). This reality \nhas produced jarring electoral outcomes relevant to the seventh factor: not a single \nAfrican American has been elected to statewide office since the turn of the century—\nindeed, only two have ever been elected in the State’s history, SF ¶ 159—and \nvirtually  all  African-American  representatives  in  the  Alabama  Legislature  are \nelected from majority-minority districts, almost all of which were created as a result \nof judicial intervention. 2 Tr. 304:9-305:12 (McCrary); 2 Tr. 379:8-25 (Knight); 3 \nTr. 577:13-20 (Sanders). This lack of representation in Alabama has a “profound \nimpact” on the lives of African Americans. 3 Tr. 559:7-559:23 (Sanders). \nWith respect to the first and third Senate Factors, Plaintiffs have proven \n \n- 21 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 26 of 31\n \nAlabama’s notorious history of official voting-related race discrimination and its \nongoing use of voting practices that enhance such discrimination. Pls.’ Br. at 19-25; \nsee  2  Tr.  264:17-311:7  (McCrary);  3  Tr.  556:20-558:10  (Sanders).  At  trial, \nAlabamians who have lived this discrimination brought this reality to life, from \nbombings and lynchings, 2 Tr. 349:19-23 (Knight), 2 Tr. 442:22-443:14 (Chestnut), \nto racially-targeted, unfounded prosecutions of voter fraud, 3 Tr. 549:17-551:11 \n(Sanders).  This  terror  and  persecution  continues  to  stoke  fear  among  African \nAmericans, depressing political participation. 2 Tr. 361:21-363:21 (Knight); 3 Tr. \n551:17-553:23 (Sanders).  \nWith  respect  to  the  fifth  Senate  Factor,  it  is  undisputed  that  significant \ndisparities exist between African-American and white Alabamians among virtually \nevery dimension of life. 1 Tr. 99:14-100:2, 102:12-108:1 (Cooper); 5 Tr. 896:10-15 \n(Hood); SF ¶¶ 139-151. At trial, Plaintiffs’ fact witnesses described the daily toll \nimposed by disparities in access to health care, 1 Tr. 220:3-24, 244:22-25 (Jones), 2 \nTr. 425:25-427:5 (Chestnut), 2 Tr. 473:13-474:20 (Tyson); education, 1 Tr. 221:16-\n222:3 (Jones), 2 Tr. 365:10-366:3 (Knight), 2 Tr. 420:6-422:25 (Chestnut), 3 Tr. \n562:5-25 (Sanders); criminal justice, 1 Tr. 221:20-224:9 (Jones), 2 Tr. 338:11-14, \n340:2-11, 353:11-21 (Knight), 2 Tr. 423:1-424:5 (Chestnut), 2 Tr. 475:13-476:1 \n(Tyson);  employment  and  income,  1  Tr.  224:10-225:12  (Jones),  2  Tr.  354:22-\n \n- 22 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 27 of 31\n \n357:25, 358:13-359:16 (Knight), 2 Tr. 424:20-425:24 (Chestnut); access to working \nutilities, 1 Tr. 226:3-25 (Jones); and affordable housing, 1 Tr. 225:13-226:2 (Jones), \n2 Tr. 339:17-340:1 (Knight), 2 Tr. 427:6-428:1 (Chestnut), 2 Tr. 474:21-475:12 \n(Tyson). It cannot be disputed that such disparities stem from this State’s long \nhistory of entrenched discrimination. See 2 Tr. 331:14-332:22 (McCrary); 2 Tr. \n331:20-22, 364:24-366:3, 367:16-369:22 (Knight); 3 Tr. 562:5-563:13 (Sanders). \nThough Plaintiffs are not required to prove that these disparities result in \nbarriers to electoral participation among African Americans, their impact is clear. \nFor example, because they disproportionately work multiple, lower-paying jobs, \nAfrican Americans have less opportunity to spend time and resources obtaining an \nID, registering to vote, visiting a polling place, and standing in long lines to cast a \nballot. 2 Tr. 358:1-13, 359:17-360:17, 363:22-364:12, 375:16-24 (Knight). Because \nthey have fewer resources, African Americans tend to move residences more often, \nand each time they do, they must pay a fee to alter the address on their ID before \ncasting  a  vote.  2  Tr.  483:6-18,  488:21-491:12  (Tyson).  At  a  certain  point,  the \ncumulative  effect  of  socioeconomic  difficulties  African  Americans \ndisproportionately face makes the process of voting “prohibitive.” 3 Tr. 564:24-\n565:11 (Sanders). And making matters worse, irregularities in the voting process \ndisproportionately occur in African-American communities, including polling-place \n \n- 23 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 28 of 31\n \nchanges  without  notification,  registration-record  mismanagement,  and  DMV \nclosures. 1 Tr. 234:24-236:18 (Jones); 2 Tr. 375:25-376:19, 377:12-379:7 (Knight); \n2 Tr. 488:2-20 (Tyson); 3 Tr. 545:18-549:17 (Sanders). \nAs to the sixth Senate Factor, the Court heard testimony regarding the various \nways in which Alabama politicians use race to stereotype racial minorities and prey \nupon the fears of white voters. 1 Tr. 228:11-232:7 (Jones); 2 Tr. 345:23-346:6 \n(Knight); 2 Tr. 429:2-432:18, 437:11-442:6 (Chestnut); 3 Tr. 506:11-509:8 (Tyson). \nFor example, Ms. Chestnut explained how Representative Brooks’ assertions that \nthere is an ongoing “war on whites” “incites fear” by suggesting to Alabamians that \n“white people should be afraid of people that don’t look like them, people that look \nlike me, people that look like my husband . . . [and] my granddaughter.” 2 Tr. 430:2-\n6. And last year, the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court touted how he had \n“taken on” racial-justice organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, the \nsame organization that sought to determine who had planted a burning cross on \nRepresentative Knight’s lawn. See 2 Tr. 382:6-383:11 (Knight); 2 Tr. 440:3-20 \n(Chestnut).  Aside from deepening the racial divide within the electorate, these \nstatements alienate African Americans by making them feel as if they “don’t matter” \nand that they are “second class citizen[s].” 2 Tr. 431:9-15, 441:4-6 (Chestnut). \n*    *    * \n \n- 24 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 29 of 31\n \nUltimately, what emerged at trial were two very different political realities. \nFrom the perspective of Senator Sanders, for example, race has defined not only his \nchildhood, but his present reality: his right to vote, his views on and experiences in \neducation and criminal justice, and his continued fight for equality in all aspects of \nhis professional, political, and civic life. E.g., 3 Tr. 565:12-17, 568:2-569:25. But \nfrom the perspective of Congressman Byrne, race is of no import: he does not know \nthe African-American composition of his district, he does not remember racially \nincendiary  statements  made  by  fellow  politicians,  and  despite  the  universally \nrecognized disparities discussed above, he sees no difference between the needs of \nhis African-American constituents and those of his white constituents. E.g., 4 Tr. \n717:1-19, 723:8-724:22, 728:8-729:3. One need not disbelieve either of these two \nAlabama representatives to recognize that the reality of daily and political life is \ndifferent for African-American and white Alabamians. That is precisely the scenario \nin which the totality-of-the-circumstances confirms that submergence of African-\nAmerican voters into districts where they lack political power denies them “a seat at \nthe table,” 2 Tr. 455:5 (Chestnut), and violates the VRA. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  The trial evidence proved that Alabama’s current congressional plan dilutes \nthe voting strength of African Americans in violation of Section 2 of the VRA.\n \n- 25 - \n  \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 116     Filed 12/13/19     Page 30 of 31\n \nDated:  December 13, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  By /s/ Bruce V.

The\nFourteenth Amendment’s prohibition against racial sorting and the duty to respect\ncommunities of interest limit both the requirement and the ability of a State to\ndivide voters into black and white districts. The evidence in this case will show\nthat Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders that break\nup longstanding communities of interest in order to connect distant voters who\nhave nothing in common except for race.\nMoreover, because the only relief Plaintiffs can receive is a declaratory\njudgment of whether Alabama should have drawn two majority-black districts in\n2011, this case is moot. A judgment declaring what Alabama should have done\nbased on 2011 conditions will not determine what Alabama can or should do after\na new census and after those conditions radically change with population shifts\nand, perhaps, even losing a Congressional seat. For these and other reasons\ndiscussed below, Defendant will ask for a judgment in his favor.\n1\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 7 of 34\nI. Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans do not satisfy the Gingles 1\ncompactness prerequisite because they split historical\ncommunities of interest in order to connect distant voters with\nnothing in common except for race.\nPlaintiffs cannot meet the first Gingles requirement that the African-\nAmerican population is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to\nconstitute a majority in a single-member district.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S.\n30, 50 (1986). Plaintiffs’ plans do not satisfy this condition because they break up\nlongstanding communities of interest to connect pockets of African-American\nvoters in Mobile with pockets of African-American voters in Montgomery, Macon,\nand Bullock Counties, hundreds of miles away.\nDefendant will present evidence that\nAlabama’s current geographically-compact First\nCongressional District has centered around\nMobile Bay for 50 years, and the State has long\nconsidered the Gulf Coast counties to be a\nstrong community of interest. Voters in the First\nDistrict, black and white, are bound together\nsocially, culturally, and economically. Likewise,\nAlabama2011CongressionalPlan\nthe Wiregrass counties in the current Second\nDistrict represent a strong community of interest that is culturally and\neconomically distinct from the Gulf Counties. Yet Plaintiffs would break up these\n2\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 8 of 34\nhistorical districts and communities of interest in order to draw a new majority-\nblack Second District based on nothing more than race and the unsavory\nassumption that black voters in Mobile and black voters in distant Montgomery,\nMacon, and Bullock Counties think alike and share the same interests simply\nbecause they are black.\nPlaintiffs’ First and Second districts are not geographically compact and\nencompass so many distinct interests (shipping, airline manufacturing, tourism,\nand fishing in Mobile, versus agriculture and\nmilitary bases in the Wiregrass), that each\nwould be impossible to effectively represent, to\nthe detriment of citizens of all races in both\ndistricts. The Court will hear testimony from\nRep. Bradley Byrne and former Rep. Jo Bonner\nthat a Representative’s attention and political\ncapital would be diluted if he or she were asked\nPlaintiffs'IllustrativePlan4\nto pursue so many different political goals.\nThus, “the social, political, and economic makeup of [Plaintiffs’ proposed\ndistricts] tells a tale of disparity, not community.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900,\n908 (1995). Section 2 does not require Alabama to draw such districts. A district\nthat “reaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities” is\n3\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 9 of 34\nnot reasonably compact. Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 979 (1996). And part of the\nGingles 1 “compactness” inquiry requires a court to consider whether Plaintiffs are\nignoring existing communities of interest: “[T]he § 2 compactness inquiry should\ntake into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities\nof interest and traditional boundaries.” Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74, 91-92\n(1997).\nThe Court asked the parties to address the standards for compactness.\nDifferent mathematical scores are used by demographers to measure compactness,\nsuch as the ratio of a district’s area to its perimeter, but such tests alone do not\nusually end the analysis. Defendant is not aware of any bright-line rules in the case\nlaw, and in fact, courts often appear to use a simple “eye” test.\nIn this case, Defendant contends that Districts 1 and 2 in Plaintiffs’\nillustrative plans are not reasonably compact because they break up communities\nof interest to divide voters along racial lines, selectively choosing counties,\nprecincts, and parts thereof because of race, not political interests. Defendant will\nshow, for example, that when Plaintiffs split Mobile County, they do not simply\nadd the northernmost areas of Mobile County to adjacent District 2, but instead\nswoop around as necessary to target black voters for District 2 and white voters for\nDistrict 1. The result is a plan with districts that are far less compact than they\nwould be if Plaintiffs had respected these longstanding communities of interest.\n4\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 10 of 34\n“[T]here is no basis to believe a district that combines two far-flung\nsegments of a racial group with disparate interests provides the opportunity that § 2\nrequires or that the first Gingles condition contemplates.” LULAC v. Perry, 548\nU.S. 399, 433-34 (2006). The Supreme Court therefore mandates that\n[l]egitimate yet differing communities of interest should not be\ndisregarded in the interest of race. The practical consequence of\ndrawing a district to cover two distant, disparate communities is that\none or both groups will be unable to achieve their political goals.\nCompactness is, therefore, about more than ‘style points;’ it is critical\nto advancing the ultimate purposes of § 2, ensuring minority groups\nequal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice.”\nId. at 434 (emphasis added).\nII. Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans are racial gerrymanders and do not\ndemonstrate that Plaintiffs have a lawful remedy.\nPlaintiffs’ demonstrative plans do not show that Alabama could have drawn\ntwo constitutional majority-minority districts; they show only that it is possible to\ndraw two such districts through racial gerrymandering. See Abrams v. Johnson,\n521 U.S. 74, 88, 90 (1997) (affirming a District Court decision that Georgia could\nnot draw an additional majority-minority district without subordinating Georgia’s\ntraditional districting policies and allowing race to predominate). In this Circuit, it\nis clear that Plaintiffs satisfy the first Gingles prerequisite only if they show that\nthey have a legal remedy: “As part of any prima facie case under Section Two, a\n5\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 11 of 34\nplaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a proper remedy.” Davis v. Chiles, 139\nF.3d 1414, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998). If the only way Alabama could draw a second\nmajority-black district is by elevating race over traditional districting principles,\nPlaintiffs have not satisfied this requirement.\n“[E]lectoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when (1) race is\nthe ‘dominant and controlling’ or ‘predominant’ consideration in deciding to place\na significant number of voters within or without a particular district, and (2) the use\nof race is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Alabama\nLegislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1264 (2015) (cleaned up).\nDefendant will present evidence that race predominates in Plaintiffs’ Illustrative\nPlans. For example, Illustrative Plan 4 divides Mobile County, with part of it going\ninto District 1 (the majority-white district) and part going into District 2 (the\nmajority-black district). Plaintiffs’ expert did not simply divide the population, but\nintentionally did so along racial lines.1\nDefendant will seek to introduce charts attached to Donna Overton’s\ndeclaration, the particular charts to which Plaintiffs have objected, that show the\n1 The fact that Plaintiffs’ map-drawer observed some of the traditional criteria, such as\navoiding splitting some precincts and counties, does not mean that their map is not a racial\ngerrymander. “Race may predominate even when a reapportionment plan respects traditional\nprinciples … if ‘[r]ace was the criterion that … could not be compromised,’ and race-neutral\nconsiderations ‘came into play only after the race-based decision had been made.’” Bethune-Hill\nv. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 798 (2017), quoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S.\n899,907(1996).\n6\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 12 of 34\nracial nature of the splits (those disputed charts are discussed in this paragraph and\nthe accompanying footnote). The part of Mobile County that Plaintiffs’ expert\ndrew into District 2 has 61.42% of Mobile County’s population, but a\ndisproportionate 83.41% of its African-American population. And the two\nsegments of Mobile County have very different demographics. The segment that is\npart of District 2 is 47.02% black, while the segment that goes into District 1 is\nonly 14.89% black.2 That can’t be an accident, and Plaintiffs achieved this racial\ngoal by separating the races in Mobile County. Each of Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans\ndemonstrates similar racial sorting.\n2 Simple math demonstrates the manner of the splits in Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans.\nDefendant will propose to admit the declaration of Donna Overton (as Exhibit D-17). That\nDeclaration has an Exhibit D, which are reports concerning the illustrative plans (and to which\nPlaintiffs have objected). For each plan, Exhibit D includes reports titled “Assigned District\nSplits,” one for county splits and one for precinct splits. The county Assigned District Splits\nreport for Illustrative Plan 4 shows that District 1 includes part of Mobile County, and District 2\nincludes the remainder of Mobile County. The part of Mobile County that is in District 1\nincludes 159,347 persons, 125,873 of whom are white and 23,729 of whom are black. The part\nof Mobile County that is in District 2 includes 253,645 people, 122,774 of whom are white and\n119,263 of whom are black. It is easy to see that Mobile County has 412,992 total residents\n(159,347+253,645), a total of 248,647 white residents (125,873 +122,774), and a total of\n142,992blackresidents (23,729+119,263).\nProposed Defense Exhibits D-18 through D-21 present percentages, based on these\nnumbers, of how the races are split in Plaintiffs’ plans. For example, Exhibit D-21 shows that\nIllustrative Plan 4 puts 38.58% of the total population of Mobile County into District 1\n(159,347/412,922), but includes 50.62% of the white residents of Mobile County\n(125,873/248,647) and only 16.59% of the black residents of Mobile County (23,729/142,992).\nTheplanputs the other61.42%ofMobileCounty’s populationintoDistrict 2(253,645/412,922),\nwhich includes 49.38% of Mobile County’s white residents (122,774/248,647) and 83.41% of its\nblack residents (119/263/142,992). We can also calculate the different demographics of the two\n“halves” of Mobile Countyas split bythe Plaintiffs. The part of Mobile Countythat is in District\n1 is 78.99% white (125,873/159,347) and 14.89% black (23,729/159,347). However, the part of\nMobile County that is in District 2 is 48.40% white (122,774/253,645) and 47.02% black\n(119,263/253,645).\n7\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 13 of 34\nPlaintiffs’ proposed racial gerrymandering would violate the constitutional\nrights of voters and harm them in two ways: The voters would be “personally …\nsubjected to [a] racial classification,” Vera, 517 U.S. at 957, and they would be\nrepresented by a Representative who believes her or his “primary obligation is to\nrepresent only the members” of a particular racial group, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n630, 648 (1993). “When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in\nthe offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of\ntheir race, think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same\ncandidates at the polls.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 911-912 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\nThe racial discrimination that Plaintiffs’ plans require would thus violate the\nConstitution unless the districts are “narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling\ninterest.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 920. The Supreme Court has not expressly held that\ncompliance with the Voting Rights Act can provide a compelling interest that\njustifies racial discrimination but has “long assumed” it to be so. Cooper v. Harris,\n137 S.Ct. 1455, 1464 (2017)). Defendant challenges that assumption. The\nFourteenth Amendment trumps a statute, and it is not okay to violate a voter’s\nConstitutional rights through racial sorting even if Congress purports to require it.\nEven if Section 2 compliance could provide an excuse for trampling voters’\nEqual Protection rights, Plaintiffs’ proposed districts could not survive strict\n8\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 14 of 34\nscrutiny. The Alabama Legislature had no good reason to believe in 2011 (or any\ntime thereafter) that two constitutional majority-minority districts could be drawn.3\nThat is true for three reasons: (1) As discussed above, the Alabama Legislature was\non notice that it could not break up strong communities of interest to draw non-\ncompact districts connecting disparate pockets of African-American population;\n(2) no one believed in 2011 that a plan that reduced the African-American\npopulation in District 7 to barely over 50% would be precleared by the Department\nof Justice (more on that point below);4 and (3) no Legislator introduced a viable\nplan that drew two majority-minority districts. One would think that if drawing two\nmajority-minority districts were easy and permissible, and stood a chance of\npreclearance, a member of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus would have\nintroduced such a plan, or at least would have filed suit before 2018.5\n3 Assuming compliance with a statute can provide a compelling interest for\ndiscriminating on the basis of race (a premise that Defendant rejects), a State can meet strict\nscrutinybyshowingthat it has a “strongbasis in evidence” that segregating voters was necessary\nto comply with the Voting Rights Act. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1274. “The good faith of the state\nlegislaturemust bepresumed.”Abbott v.Perez,138S.Ct.2305,2324(2018)(cleanedup).\n4 The Legislature’s judgment was validatedseveral months afterthecongressional\ndistricts becamelaw, whenAttorneyGeneral Eric Holderpreclearedthem.\n5 The evidence will show that the only plan with two majority-black districts introduced\nat the time the Legislature passed a Congressional districting plan in 2011 was a wildly\ngerrymandered plan introduced by Representative Thad McClammy, an African-American\nmember of the Alabama Legislature. See Exhibit C-11 to Alabama’s 2011 preclearance\nsubmission, proposed in this case as Exhibit D-3. That plan included one district that connected\nBirmingham with parts of the Black Belt, and then snaked up alongthe Mississippi border up the\nlength of the State, and then turned right to follow the Tennessee River to grab black voters in\nHuntsville. The second majority-black district was equally discriminatory, connecting black\nvoters in Mobile to black voters in far-away Anniston. McClammy produced another plan, one\nclosertoPlaintiffs’illustrativeplans, but after the Governorhadalreadysignedtheexistingplan.\n9\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 15 of 34\nThat brings us to a question that the Court asked the parties to address: Is\nracial gerrymandering permissible if done in an effort to comply with the Voting\nRights Act, and if so, how much? Defendant contends that no racial\ngerrymandering is permissible and that Section 2 cannot provide a justification for\nit, for reasons stated above. A map-drawer cannot point to Section 2 as the\ncompelling interest that justifies racial gerrymandering because “[Section] 2 does\nnot require a State to create, on predominantly racial lines, a district that is not\n‘reasonably compact.’” Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91-92).\nThat doesn’t mean that a State can never draw a majority-black district. If\nthe State has two alternative ways to draw a Congressional plan and each observes\ntraditional districting criteria and longstanding communities of interest, but one\nplan has a majority-black district and the other has none, then Section 2 requires\nthe plan with a majority-black district (or, at least, compactness and racial\ngerrymandering do not present an obstacle to the plan.) For example, if the\nLegislature draws a plan where race does not predominate and then notes that a\ndistrict is 40 or 45% black, it may be constitutional to bump the district up to over\n50% black if that can be done in a way that continues to observe traditional\ndistricting principles, and the State otherwise has a strong basis in evidence to\nconclude that changes on the margins of the districts are required by law. But in\nthis case, for all the reasons discussed above, the State would never have split\n10\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 16 of 34\nMobile and Baldwin County simply to connect voters in Mobile and Dothan, or\nMobile and Bullock County, because no community of interest connects those\nvoters. Alabama could not draw such a district unless the Legislature put race\nabove all other criteria. The Voting Rights Act does not require Alabama to draw\nsuch a district and thus cannot be used to justify a constitutional violation. The\nanswer to the question of how much racial gerrymandering is okay is “zero.”\nIf Defendant is correct, what about District 7? As the Court pointed out at a\npretrial conference, District 7 appears to be racially gerrymandered, with a finger\nsticking up from the black belt for the sole purpose of grabbing the black\npopulation of Jefferson County. Defendant does not believe that the law would\npermit Alabama to draw that district today if the finger into Jefferson County was\nfor the predominate purpose of drawing African American voters into the district.\nAlabama did so in the early 1990s as part of a consent decree, at a time when the\nDepartment of Justice was enforcing a “max-black” policy that required States to\ndraw as many majority-black districts as possible, no matter what, or else DOJ\nwould not preclear the plan under Section 5. See Johnson v. Miller, 864 F. Supp.\n1354, 1360-61 (S.D. Ga. 1994); Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1284-85 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). The max-black policy was appropriately rejected in Miller, 515 U.S. at\n924-927, and no longer applies, but once the district existed, Alabama had to\ncontinue to draw the district in order to comply with Section 5’s anti-retrogression\n11\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 17 of 34\nrequirement. Today, with Section 5 effectively tabled, Alabama has more liberty to\ndraw its districts differently. In 2021 there may be permissible, non-racial reasons\nfor which Alabama might preserve a link between Jefferson County and Black Belt\ncounties in the same congressional district, but that does not mean that the district\nwas legal when drawn, or that Alabama could draw it so race-consciously today.\nThe DOJ-required discrimination of 1992 cannot excuse new discrimination in\n2021.\nRacial gerrymandering is therefore never permissible. Dividing the State\ninto separate-but-equal districts is not only bad policy,6 it is illegal, and Plaintiffs\ndo not meet their Gingles requirements with an unconstitutional plan.\nIII. Plaintiffs’ claims are moot because entirely different conditions will\nexist after the 2020 census.\nPlaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief was made moot by the Court’s March\n27 decision on laches, doc. 52, which denied them the only relief that would have\nhad a practical effect on the relationship between the parties: an injunction\nrequiring the State to redraw its congressional districts before the 2020 election (or\nbefore the 2021 census that will reveal new population distributions). True enough,\n6 “Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing\nracial factions; it threatens to carryus further from the goal of a political system in which race no\nlonger matters—a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and to which the\nNationcontinues toaspire.”Shaw v.Reno,509 U.S.630,657(1993).\n12\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 18 of 34\nPlaintiffs’ have also asked for declaratory relief, but a declaratory judgment would\nhave no effect on the relationship between the parties: A judgment declaring what\nthe Legislature should or should not have done in 2011, based on the conditions\nthat existed at that time, does not tell us what the Legislature can or cannot do in\n2021 when those conditions will have changed with new census numbers. For this\nreason, the declaratory judgment claim became moot when injunctive relief was\ndenied. Flanigan’s Enters., Inc. of Georgia v. City of Sandy Springs, 868 F.3d\n1248, 1264 (11th Cir. 2017) (F]ederal courts are without power to decide questions\nthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them. … [A] previously\njusticiable case is moot when the requested relief, if granted, would no longer have\nany practical effect on the rights or obligations of the litigants.”) (internal citations,\nquotation marks and footnotes omitted).\nAlabama’s new congressional districts will not be drawn until after the 2020\nCensus is released in early 2021. We can only guess at their boundaries, which will\nbe shaped by new population data, the need to compensate for population shifts\nover the last 10 years,7 the number of congressional districts that Alabama will\nhave (7 or 6),8 and the political interests of the Legislators and members of\n7 See, e.g., Defense Exhibit 5 which shows the adjustments Alabama’s congressional\ndistricts needed after 2010 Census to equalize their populations; 225,177 people had to be moved\nintoorout ofall districts, andalmost 80,000peoplehadtobemovedintoDistrict 7.\n8 Plaintiffs’ expert submitted a six-district plan in an effort to show that Alabama could\ndraw two majority-black districts even if it loses a Congressional seat. That plan is absurd. The\nevidence will show that it is gerrymandered along racial lines to an even greater extent than\n13\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 19 of 34\nCongress who draw the districts – all presently unknowable. We cannot even know\nin which new districts each of the Plaintiffs will reside. The important point is that\nthe number of majority-black districts Alabama can draw in 2021 will depend upon\nthese presently unknown conditions, not a declaration of what the 2010 conditions\nrequired. How those districts can and will be shaped is speculation at this time, and\nfederal courts “do not have the power to ‘advise’ potential parties about the\nlawfulness of potential actions that have not and may never occur.” Gagliardi v.\nTJCV Land Trust, 889 F.3d 728, 735 (11th Cir. 2018).\nPlaintiffs disagree. They say that “declaratory relief [would serve] the\nfunction of ensuring that the next congressional districting map does not build\nupon and exacerbate the voting rights violations that pervade the current plan.”\nDoc 31 at 32-33.9 But this argument is rooted in Section 5 law that no longer\napplies after Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013) (holding that Section 5\ncould not be enforced using Section 4’s coverage formula that was based on prior\ndiscrimination occurring in the 1960’s and before).\nPlaintiffs’ seven-district plans, and it is based on wild guesses of how Alabama’s population will\nshift after the next census. Mr. Cooper assumes that counties will gain or lose a certain amount\nof population and then meanders around the state, reaching into areas as necessary to find\nAfrican-American voters to sort. Even with all that speculation and gerrymandering, he still is\nbarelyable to get to 50% BVAP. If he is off bya hair in his assumptions of how populations will\nmove, the districts will be nowhere close to equal population, will fail to have African-American\nmajorities, orboth.\n9 Citations aretoECF-generatednumbers.\n14\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 20 of 34\nPlaintiffs took their “benchmark” argument from Sanders v. Dooly County,\nGa., 245 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam),10 which involved a racial\ngerrymandering challenge to board of education districts. The District Court held\nthat the plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief was barred by their delay in filing suit.\nSanders, 245 F.3d at 1290. The Eleventh Circuit sustained the District Court on\nthis point, but parted ways with the District Court’s decision that plaintiffs’ claims\nfor declaratory judgment likewise were barred. Id., 245 F.3d at 1291. A declaratory\njudgment would not prejudice the defendant board of education, the Eleventh\nCircuit said, and “[a]n effect of a grant of such declaratory relief could be to\nprevent the [U.S.] Attorney General from using the 1993 consent-decree plan as a\nbaseline for retrogression analysis in the post-2000 census round of preclearance\nproceedings under §5 of the Voting Rights Act…” Id. at 1291-92 (footnotes\nomitted). See also Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 327-28 (2000)\n(rejecting argument that if school board’s 1992 district plan “will never again be\nused for any purpose” voting rights challenge was moot, because it would “serve\nas the baseline against which appellee’s next voting plan will be evaluated for the\npurposes of preclearance.”)).\nSanders and Reno therefore hold that a declaratory judgment about districts\nthat will not be used again may still have value if the judgment determines which\n10 Seedoc.31 at 32-33.\n15\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 21 of 34\nplan will serve as the Section 5 benchmark. However, Section 5 no longer is\nenforceable because the Supreme Court held that the conditions of the 1960s\ncannot serve as a basis for requiring preclearance today. Shelby County v. Holder,\n570 U.S. 529, 557 (2013). With §5 no longer available to serve as the statutory\nanvil to a declaratory hammer, a declaratory judgment that the 2011 districts\nviolate §2 would not change the relationship between the parties. Accordingly, this\ncase is moot. Gagliardi, 889 F.3d at 734 (“But before a federal court may issue\nrelief under the [Declaratory Judgment] Act, there must still be a case or\ncontroversy that is live, is ‘definite and concrete,’ and is susceptible to ‘specific\nrelief through decree of conclusive character….’”).\nPopulations shift between census cycles, with some communities growing,\nsome stagnant, and some losing population. The evidence will show that the Black\nBelt and inner-city Birmingham typically shrink in population compared to the rest\nof the State, which means it will likely be harder after the next census for Alabama\nto draw even one majority-black district without racially gerrymandering, much\nless two. Because a declaratory judgment would not affect a change in the\nrelationship between the parties in this case, it would be advisory and therefore\nwould be beyond the Court’s jurisdiction. Penn Tank Lines, Inc. v. Jackson, 2018\nWL 465977, *3 (N.D. Ala. January 18, 2018) (“[A] federal court has neither the\npower to render advisory opinions or ‘to decide questions that cannot affect the\n16\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 22 of 34\nrights of litigants in the case before them.’ Its judgments must resolve ‘a real and\nsubstantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of conclusive\ncharacter, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a\nhypothetical state of facts.”) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401\n(1975)).\nWith injunctive relief off the table, a declaratory judgment that the 2011\ndistricts violated §2 has no value to Plaintiffs except as a defense to be asserted if\nthe Legislature draws districts they do not like in 2021. Yet Plaintiffs have neither\na right to nor a need for such a declaratory judgment now, before the Legislature\ndraws new congressional districts. In 2021, if Plaintiffs don’t like the new districts,\nthey can bring a §2 action and “the court hearing that case, with all the facts\navailable to it, will determine the merits” of their claim. Id. at *3.\nIV. Plaintiffs’ plans would not have been precleared in 2011.\nFurthermore, if Alabama had drawn the State’s congressional districts in the\nway Plaintiffs’ Illustrative Plans suggest is required by Section 2, it would not have\nbeen able to obtain preclearance to implement such plans. See 52 U.S.C. § 10304.\nTo receive preclearance under §5 of the Voting Rights Act, either the Attorney\nGeneral or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia must find that the\nchange “neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\n17\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 23 of 34\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.” Id. Section 5 also specifies that any\nchange that “will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the\nUnited States on account of race or color … to elect their preferred candidates of\nchoice denies or abridges the right to vote.” Id. More specifically, “[w]hether a\nvoting procedure change should be precleared depends on whether the change\n‘would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to\ntheir effective exercise of the electoral franchise.’” Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S.\n461, 466 (2003) (quoting Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141 (1976)).\nAt the time Alabama’s 2011 Congressional map was drawn, state legislators\noperated under the entirely reasonable assumption that no map that reduced the\nBVAP for a majority-minority district to the levels Plaintiffs propose (i.e., right at\n50% BVAP) would receive preclearance, because there was a risk such a district\nwould actually diminish, rather than extend, black voters’ ability to elect their\ncandidates of choice. Indeed, this understanding was echoed by prominent black\nstate legislators, who indicated that a district where the black population was\nreduced to less than 62% might fail to perform in elections, and so would be\nunable to obtain preclearance. See generally Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v. Alabama,\n231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1040-1041 (M.D. Ala. 2017) (citing Sen. Hank Sanders\nasking for 62% black as the minimum for an African-American district and\nRepresentative Thomas Jackson arguing for 62-65% black).\n18\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 24 of 34\nIndeed, if Plaintiffs’ own assertions about the average percentage difference\nbetween black and white voter turnout are correct, see doc. 95 ¶ 154, taken in\nconjunction with their own experts’ conclusions about racially polarized voting in\nAlabama, see doc. 95 ¶¶ 99-114, it would be easy to draw the conclusion that Mr.\nCooper’s hypothetical districts containing barely 50% BVAP could “have the\neffect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of\nrace or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice.” At the very least, the\ndata on voter turnout and polarized voting would raise serious concerns about\nwhether Plaintiffs’ proposed majority-minority districts might in the end take away\nAfrican-Americans’ undisputed ability to elect candidates of their choice in one\ndistrict, and create a situation where there would be no assurance of black voters’\nability to elect the candidates of their choice in either of the two “majority” black\ndistricts.\nThe evidence will show that the 2011 Congressional delegation hired a\nconsultant to draw a plan to propose to the Legislature, and that the plan they\nproposed is the one that was passed with no material changes. The evidence will\nfurther show that Congresswoman Sewell approved her district. She, perhaps more\nthan anyone, knows what is needed for minority voters in her district to have a\nrealistic opportunity to elect their candidate of choice, and there will be no\nevidence that suggests that she would have approved of packing minority voters in\n19\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 25 of 34\nher district or harming them in any way. Her stamp of approval on the plan, and\nSenator Sander’s statement that more than 60% BVAP was needed to provide\nminority voters with electoral opportunity, show that a plan of around 50% BVAP\nwould have been retrogressive and would not have been precleared.\nV. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that any alleged vote dilution is “on\naccount of race or color.”\nThe text of Section 2 makes clear that vote dilution is illegal only if it is “on\naccount of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). And the Eleventh Circuit has\nemphasized this fact: “[T]o be actionable, a deprivation of the minority group's\nright to equal participation in the political process must be on account of a\nclassification, decision, or practice that depends on race or color, not on account of\nsome other racially neutral cause.” Solomon v. Liberty Cty. Comm’rs, 221 F.3d\n1218, 1225 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc), quoting Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494,\n1515 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (Tjoflat, C.J., plurality opinion).\nIf some black voters are unable usually to elect their candidate of choice\nunder the current district lines, it must therefore be “on account of race or color”\nfor plaintiffs to prevail, not some other cause such as party affiliation. Plaintiffs\nargue that they can make this showing by demonstrating that voting is polarized in\nAlabama, but that tells us nothing of the reason behind the votes. Defendant will\npresent evidence that African-American voters overwhelmingly prefer Democratic\n20\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 26 of 34\ncandidates everywhere, not just in Alabama.11 That means that voting is polarized\nwherever a majority of white voters tend to support Republican candidates. A\nshowing of polarized voting therefore does not show that that the system is broken;\nit shows that Alabama is a conservative state, which is news to no one. To say that\npolarized voting is, by itself, evidence of racial bias is to say that voting\nRepublican is evidence of racial bias.\nAs the Fifth Circuit noted, a proper interpretation of the Gingles\nrequirements involves consideration of whether the candidates of choice of black\nvoters lose elections because of race or for a more benign reason, such as party\npolitics:\nThe scope of the Voting Rights Act is indeed quite broad, but its\nrigorous protections, as the text of § 2 suggests, extend only to defeats\nexperienced by voters “on account of race or color.” Without an\ninquiry into the circumstances underlying unfavorable election\nreturns, courts lack the tools to discern results that are in any sense\n“discriminatory,” and any distinction between deprivation and mere\nlosses at the polls becomes untenable. In holding that the failure of\nminority-preferred candidates to receive support from a majority of\nwhites on a regular basis, without more, sufficed to prove legally\nsignificant racial bloc voting, the district court loosed § 2 from its\nracial tether and fused illegal vote dilution and political defeat.\n11 Defendants will also show that Plaintiffs’ evidence regarding certain “Senate Factors”\ndoes nothing to single Alabama out or to demonstrate the existence of racial bias. For example,\nPlaintiffs argue that the fact that African-Americans lag behind whites in Alabama in certain\nsocio-economic factors is caused by Alabama’s discriminatory past and is a reason to be\nsuspicious that Alabama is guilty of illegal vote dilution, but in fact those socio-economic gaps\nunfortunately exist in every single State studied, including such northern States as New York,\nDelaware,Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, NewJersey,andConnecticut.\n21\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 27 of 34\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 850 (5th Cir.\n1993). Citing to the text of § 2, legislative history, and Gingles itself, the Fifth\nCircuit held that legally significant racial bloc voting is not shown if people vote\nthe way they do because of party preferences: “The Voting Rights Act does not\nguarantee that nominees of the Democratic Party will be elected, even if black\nvoters are likely to favor that party’s candidates. Rather, § 2 is implicated only\nwhere Democrats lose because they are black, not where blacks lose because they\nare Democrats.” Id. at 854 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added).\nThe Eleventh Circuit has similarly held that voter motivations are relevant to\nthe question of vote dilution. It is not clear if the Eleventh Circuit views voter\nmotivation as part of the definition of racial bloc voting, as does the Fifth Circuit,\nor whether the Eleventh Circuit views it as part of the “totality of the\ncircumstances” analysis, or if the Court has even decided that question. What is\nclear is that voter motivation is part of the analysis, and a simple difference in\nvoter preferences is not enough to establish a § 2 violation:\n[I]t is entirely possible that bloc voting (as defined by Gingles) could\nexist, but that such bloc voting would not result in a diminution of\nminority opportunity to participate in the political process and elect\nrepresentatives of the minority group’s choice. Other circumstances\nmay indicate that both the degree and nature of the bloc voting weigh\nagainst an ultimate finding of minority exclusion from the political\nprocess. The degree of racial polarization may not be sufficiently\nintense, for example; or what appears to be bloc voting on account of\n22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 28 of 34\nrace may, instead, be the result of political or personal affiliation of\ndifferent racial groups with different candidates.\nSolomon v. Liberty Cty. Comm’rs, 221 F.3d 1218, 1225 (11th Cir. 2000) (emphasis\nadded) (en banc).\nThus, showing that black and white voters prefer different candidates is not\nenough to establish a § 2 violation. Otherwise, the Voting Rights Act becomes a\npartisan tool, stepping in to give a leg up to the party black voters prefer even if a\nmajority of Alabamians support the other party for non-racial reasons.12 The record\nwill not show that racial bias is the reason that a majority of present-day\nAlabamians usually vote Republican, and therefore any alleged vote dilution is not\non account of race or color.\nVI. Plaintiffs DuBose, Love, Williams and Harris lack standing\nPlaintiffs Bobby Dubose, Rodney Love, and Janice Williams live in\nJefferson County and are represented by Congresswoman Terri Sewell in District\n7. The evidence will show that they are presently able to elect their candidate of\nchoice. In all four of Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans, these three Plaintiffs would\nremain in District 7 and would continue to be able to elect their candidate of\nchoice. Plaintiffs have disavowed a racial gerrymandering claim where a voter\nmight claim an injury of being subject to a racial classification; here, with only a\n12 Turning §2 into a partisan tool, instead of a protection against racial discrimination\noutlawed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, would raise serious questions about the\nconstitutionalityofthestatute.\n23\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 29 of 34\nSection 2 claim, the question is whether the plaintiff is able to elect his or her\ncandidate of choice. A judgment in these Plaintiffs’ favor would not change their\nability to elect their candidate of choice in the least or redress any alleged injury,\nand these Plaintiffs therefore lack standing.\n“Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to the\nconsideration of ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies.’” Stalley ex rel. United States v.\nOrlando Reg’l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir. 2008)\n(quoting U.S. Const. art. III, § 2). Therefore, a plaintiff must show Article III\nstanding to vest a federal court with subject matter jurisdiction. Id.\nStanding consists of three elements: (1) an injury in fact; (2) that is traceable\nto defendant’s conduct; and (3) that can be redressed with a favorable decision\nfrom the court. Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1929 (2018) (citing Spokeo, Inc.\nv. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016)). Together these elements serve as the\n“irreducible constitutional minimum” required to establish Article III standing.\nSpokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560–61 (1992)). A plaintiff fails to show redressability, and therefore\nstanding, when the relief the plaintiff seeks would not “put [the plaintiff] in any\ndifferent position than [plaintiff] is currently in now.” Kawa Orthodontics, LLP v.\nSec’y, U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 773 F.3d 243, 247–48 (11th Cir. 2014).\n24\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 30 of 34\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act protects the ability of racial minorities to\n“participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” 52\nU.S.C. § 10301. Courts have split on whether an injury sufficient to support\nstanding in a Section Two vote dilution claim may arise from an entire redistricting\nscheme or instead must arise from the plaintiff’s own district. See generally Luna\nv. County of Kern, 291 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1122 n.14 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (discussing\nthis split and collecting cases). However, independent of any showing of injury, “it\nmust be likely, as opposed to merely speculative,” that a favorable decision will\nresult in a favorable change of position. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (1992).\nThese three Plaintiffs lack standing because a favorable decision of this\nCourt would not “put [them] in any different position than [they are] currently in\nnow.” Kawa Orthodontics, LLP, 773 at 247–48. Congressional District 7 “has been\nrepresented by an African American since 1992” and “is currently represented by\nRepresentative Terri Sewell, who was first elected in 2010.” Doc. 14 ¶ 35. These\nPlaintiffs concede that Representative Sewell is their candidate of choice (they just\nwant new districts so that other voters can be in a majority-minority district too).\nTherefore, these Plaintiffs will continue to have the same opportunity to\n“participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice”\nregardless of whether this Court rules for them. 52 U.S.C. § 10301. With either a\n25\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 31 of 34\nfavorable or an unfavorable decision, the Jefferson County Plaintiffs will be able to\nelect their candidate of choice.\nUltimately, these Plaintiffs will not experience any practical changes in their\nlives even if this Court rules in their favor. They will continue to be able to\nparticipate in the political process and will continue to be able to elect the\nrepresentative of their choice. They will be represented by the same person in the\nsame district, and they have no standing to argue that other voters in other parts of\nthe State should be part of a different sort of district. Even assuming, arguendo,\nthat Plaintiffs Dubose, Love and Williams have an injury sufficient to support\nstanding, the “irreducible constitutional minimum” demands an independent\nshowing of redressability. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. Accordingly, Plaintiffs must\nshow that a favorable decision of this Court is likely to put them “in any different\nposition” than they are in now to establish standing. These plaintiffs cannot do so.\nFor a similar reason, Plaintiff John Harris lacks standing. He currently lives\nin Opelika, part of District 3. He would continue to live in District 3, a majority-\nwhite district, in all four of the Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans. There is therefore no\nevidence that a judgment in his favor would alter his situation at all, and he has no\nstanding to argue that other voters in other parts of Alabama should be part of a\nparticular sort of district.\n26\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 32 of 34\nVII. Any-part-Black and single-race-Black\nThe experts disagree over the proper measurement of minority voting\nstrength. Plaintiff expert Bill Cooper lumps those who identify as any-part Black\non the census with those who identify as single-race Black on the census. Defense\nexperts note that the Alabama Reapportionment Office (and therefore the Alabama\nLegislature) has historically used single-race Black to determine whether a district\nis a majority-minority district.\nDefendant is not aware of any authority requiring the use of one category to\nthe exclusion of the other, but he maintains the single-race Black is the appropriate\ncategory in this case. First of all, there is no evidence that those who identify as\nmixed-race vote cohesively with those who identify as single-race Black. That\nmatters when determining whether a district will in fact provide an opportunity for\nminority voters to elect their candidate of choice. Second, Alabama’s voter\nregistration database does not have categories for voters to identify with more than\none race, and therefore the single-race census category is a better comparator when\nassessing Dr. Palmer’s reports. When he discusses how many African-American\nvoters make up the electorate in state-wide elections in the “focus area,” or how\nAfrican-Americans tend to vote, he is referring to those who identified as African-\nAmerican on a voter registration form, not all persons who identify as African-\n27\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 33 of 34\nAmerican plus some other race (which is not an option on the voter registration\nform).\nThe difference is admittedly small, because very few people identify as\nmixed-race Black on the census, but Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans have such razor-\nthin margins, it is enough to knock two of their districts below 50% BVAP.\nBecause it allows for more of an apples-to-apples comparison, and because it is\nconsistent with the practice of the Alabama Legislature, Defendant argues that\nsingle-race black is the appropriate measure for BVAP.\nVIII. Conclusion\nPlaintiffs essentially want to put Alabama back under the failed “max-\nblack” policies of the 1990s, requiring Alabama to draw a second majority-black\ndistrict even if it requires racial gerrymandering and a disregard of communities of\ninterest. That is not the law. Moreover, the declaratory judgment that they week\nwill alter the legal relationship between the parties, because Alabama’s ability to\ndraw a second majority-minority district in 2021 will depend on the new census\nnumbers and new conditions, not a judgment concerning what Alabama should\nhave done under the very different conditions that existed in 2011. For these and\nother reasons discussed above, Defendant will ask the Court to enter judgment in\nhis favor at the conclusion of this case.\n28\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 101   Filed 10/28/19   Page 34 of 34\nRespectfully submitted,\nSteve Marshall\nAttorney General\ns/ James W.

INTRODUCTION \n \n  Defendant  John  H.  Merrill,  Alabama  Secretary  of  State,  has  moved  to  dismiss  the \nPlaintiffs’  Complaint  and  filed  a  “Notice  of  Jurisdictional  Issue”1  based  on  a  severe \nmisinterpretation and mischaracterization of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as \namended (the “VRA”), and Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs challenge the Alabama congressional \nmap—which was passed by the state legislature in 2011 and is now codified at Ala. Code § 17-14-\n70—on the grounds that it violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301. ECF \nNo. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶ 1. Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim is the sole claim asserted by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs \ndo not bring any claims under the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs do not challenge any \ndistrict  in  the  2011  Map  as  a  racial  gerrymander  under  either  the  Fourteenth  or  Fifteenth \nAmendments.  Indeed,  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  only  makes  reference  to  the  terms  “racial \ngerrymander” or “racial gerrymandering” when discussing the history of racial discrimination in \nvoting in Alabama, a critical part of alleging that the “totality of the circumstances” support \nPlaintiffs’ Section 2 claim. See Compl. ¶¶ 32, 74, 77. \n  In his “Notice of Jurisdictional Issue,” Defendant raises a question as to whether Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory claim brought under the VRA should be assigned to a three-judge court pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C.  §  2284.  In  so  doing,  Defendant  conflates  Plaintiffs’  Section  2  claim  with  racial \ngerrymandering claims brought under the Fourteenth and/or Fifteenth Amendments, despite the \nfact that Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim is undoubtedly statutory, not constitutional. Further, courts \nhave repeatedly drawn a distinction between vote dilution claims brought under Section 2 of the \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs hereby respond to the Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 11, Notice of Jurisdictional Issue, \nECF No. 12, and Order to Show Cause, ECF No. 13.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 3 of 14\nVRA and racial gerrymandering claims brought under the U.S. Constitution. See Miller v. Johnson, \n515 U.S. 900, 911 (1995) (a claim of racial gerrymandering is “analytically distinct” from a vote \ndilution claim); see also Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 141 F.Supp.3d 505, \n512 (E.D.Va. 2015) (same), vacated in part on other grounds, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board \nof Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788 (2017); Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 989 F. Supp. 2d \n1227, 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2013) (same), rev’d on other grounds, Alabama Legis. Black Caucus v. \nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015). Because Plaintiffs have only alleged a Section 2 claim—not a \nconstitutional claim—a three judge court is not authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2284, and this case is \nproperly before a single district judge.  \n  Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs lack standing also fails because Plaintiffs alleged that \nthey live in either “cracked” or “packed” congressional districts, and that as a result, their votes \nare diluted in violation of Section 2. In any event, Defendant’s standing arguments are mooted by \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, which makes clear that several Plaintiffs, a number of whom were \nlisted in the original Complaint, live in areas that could be drawn into a new majority African-\nAmerican congressional district in order to remedy the current Section 2 violation. See ECF No. \n14 (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n \n  A motion to dismiss brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal \nsufficiency of a complaint, which requires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. A complaint does not require detailed factual \nallegations; it simply must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 4 of 14\n  A Rule 12(b)(1) attack that challenges the subject matter jurisdiction alleged on the face of \nthe pleadings requires the court to accept the sufficiency of the allegations as true. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1). Though the burden is on the plaintiffs to establish standing, “[a]t the pleading stage, \ngeneral factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice, for on a \nmotion to dismiss [the court] ‘presum[es] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that \nare necessary to support the claim.’” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (citation \nomitted).  \nIII.  ARGUMENT \n \nA.  This case is properly before a single district judge. \n \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284, “[a] district court of three judges shall be convened when \notherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality \nof the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative \nbody” (emphasis added). Defendant contends that there is “at least a question of whether the three-\njudge court statute is implicated in this case.” ECF No. 12 (“Not. of Juris. Issue”) at 5. But under \nthe plain language of the statute, three-judge courts are convened only where plaintiffs raise \nconstitutional claims, not statutory claims. Because Plaintiffs bring only one claim under Section \n2 of the VRA—and no constitutional claims—this case is properly before a single district judge.   \n  Defendant makes several erroneous arguments to distract from the plain language of 28 \nU.S.C. § 2284. This Court should reject each argument in turn. First, Defendant conflates \nPlaintiffs’ VRA claim with a racial gerrymandering claim in a purported attempt to transform \nPlaintiffs’ VRA claim into a constitutional claim, which would make the three-judge statute \nrelevant. See, e.g., Not. of Juris. Issue at 1-2 (“Whereas most racial gerrymandering claims have, \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 5 of 14\nat least in recent history, been brought under both the Constitution (specifically the Fourteenth and \nFifteenth Amendments) and the Voting Rights Act, Plaintiffs bring this challenge to Alabama’s \n2011 Congressional District Plan solely under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § \n10301(a).”). While Defendant correctly acknowledges that Plaintiffs’ claim was brought solely \nunder the VRA, Defendant mischaracterizes Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim when he refers to it as a \nracial  gerrymandering  claim.  Plaintiffs  do  not  allege  racial  gerrymandering  at  all  in  their \nComplaint; they allege only that their voting power has been diluted in violation of Section 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act. Courts have repeatedly made clear that vote dilution claims brought under \nSection 2 of the VRA are separate and distinct from racial gerrymandering claims brought under \nthe Constitution. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 911 (a claim of racial gerrymandering is “analytically \ndistinct” from a vote dilution claim); see also Bethune-Hill, 141 F.Supp.3d at 512 (same); Ala. \nLegislative Black Caucus, 989 F. Supp. 2d at 1290.2 \n  Given  the  distinction  between  Section  2  claims  and  racial  gerrymandering  claims, \nDefendant is misguided when he states that “there is no practical difference in the way this claim \n                                                 \n2 Defendant is also mistaken in asserting that “most racial gerrymandering claims . . . in recent \nhistory” have been brought under both the Constitution and the VRA. See, e.g., Bethune-Hill v. \nVirginia State Board of Elections, No. 3:14-cv-852, 2018 WL 3133819 (E.D.Va. June 26, 2018) \n(challenging eleven Virginia state legislative districts as racial gerrymanders under the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Harris v. McCrory, 159 F.Supp.3d 600 \n(M.D.N.C. 2016), aff’d sub nom. Cooper v. Harris, ––– U.S. ––––, 137 S.Ct. 1455, 197 L.Ed.2d \n837 (2017) (challenging the constitutionality of two North Carolina congressional districts as \nracial gerrymanders in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); \nPage v. Virginia State Board of Elections, No. 3:13-cv-678, 2015 WL 3604029 (E.D.Va. June 5, \n2015), aff’d sub nom. Wittman v. Personhuballah, 136 S.Ct. 1732 (2016) (challenging Virginia’s \nthird congressional district as a racial gerrymander under the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment). None of these racial gerrymandering cases involved VRA claims, \nfurther evidencing the analytically distinct and drastically different nature of the two legal \ndoctrines. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 6 of 14\nwill be litigated, or decided, under Section 2 and how it would have been treated if brought under \nthe Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments directly.” Not. of Juris. Issue at 2. Plaintiffs allege vote \ndilution, and vote dilution claims are properly alleged under Section 2 of the VRA. The Supreme \nCourt has held that “[t]he essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure \ninteracts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed \nby black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. \n30, 47 (1986). In Gingles, the Court identified three necessary preconditions (“the Gingles \npreconditions”) for a claim of vote dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: (1) the \nminority group must be “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in \na single-member district”; (2) the minority group must be “politically cohesive”; and (3) the \nmajority must vote “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority’s preferred \ncandidate.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. Once all three preconditions are established, the statute \ndirects courts to consider whether, under the totality of the circumstances, members of a racial \ngroup have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political \nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). The Senate Report on \nthe 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act identifies several non-exclusive factors that courts \nshould consider when determining if, under the totality of the circumstances in a jurisdiction, the \noperation of the electoral device being challenged results in a violation of Section 2. The remedy \nfor a Section 2 vote dilution claim is the creation of one or more additional districts in which \nminority voters have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. See Montes v. City of \nYakima, 40 F. Supp. 3d 1377, 1390 (E.D.Wa. 2014) (“[D]rawing a minority district in which \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 7 of 14\nminority voters represent more than 50% of all eligible voters confirms that an effective remedy \ncan be fashioned.”). None of these issues are elements of a racial gerrymandering claim.      \n  By contrast, racial gerrymandering claims under the Constitution are adjudicated under a \ndifferent legal standard, to address a different legal harm, and to provide a different legal remedy. \nSpecifically, racial gerrymandering claims are “district-specific,” Ala. Leg. Black Caucus v. \nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1265 (2015), and plaintiffs who bring racial gerrymandering claims \nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must prove that “race was the \npredominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters \nwithin or without a particular district,” Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 794. Once plaintiffs have shown \npredominance, the burden shifts to the State to demonstrate that its districting legislation is \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Id. at 801. The harms that flow from racial \ngerrymandering or racial sorting include being personally subjected to a racial classification as \nwell as being represented by a legislator who believes his primary obligation is to represent only \nthe members of a particular racial group. See Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1261. The remedy for a racial \ngerrymandering claim is not the creation of an additional majority-minority district; it is the \ncreation of a map that remedies the legislature’s unjustified sorting of voters based on the color of \ntheir skin. Plaintiffs’ VRA claim is thus analytically and practically distinct from a constitutional \nclaim. Under the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284, it is clear that Plaintiffs’ claim is properly \nbefore a single district judge. This Court should reject Defendant’s attempt to morph Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory claim into something that it is not.  \n  Second, Defendant incorrectly asserts that the Third Circuit in Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d \n175 (3d Cir. 2001), “held that 28 U.S.C. § 2284 should be construed to reach claims brought under \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 8 of 14\nthe Voting Rights Act.” Not. of Juris. Issue at 2. Later in his brief, Defendant not only recognizes \nthat the Third Circuit’s holding in Page is not binding on this Court, but he concedes that the Third \nCircuit’s holding in Page “is not directly on point” in this case. Id. at 4. Plaintiffs agree. In Page, \nplaintiffs challenged a districting map on both Section 2 and constitutional grounds, and the court \nwas confronted with the legal issue of whether a single district court judge could decide the \nstatutory Section 2 issues first without addressing the constitutional issues that are required to be \nconsidered by a three-judge court. The Page court succinctly summarized its holding: \nBased upon this history, we conclude that because statutory Voting Rights Act \nchallenges to statewide legislative apportionment are generally inextricably \nintertwined with constitutional challenges to such apportionment, those claims \nshould be considered a single ‘action’ within the meaning of § 2284(a). Thus, \nwhen a single district judge is presented with both types of claims, he or she may \nnot  resolve  the  Voting  Rights  Act  issues  in  isolation  while  reserving  the \nconstitutional claims to a three-judge court; rather, the single district judge \nshould  adhere  to  the  limitations  on  his  [or  her]  authority  imposed  by  § \n2284(b)(3). Id. at 190. \nUnder the court’s reasoning, because 28 U.S.C. § 2284 references a single legal “action,” and the \nvarious claims in that case comprised the action, the Court held that the statutory claims and \nconstitutional claims must be considered together. However, where the legal “action” consists of \nonly one claim, and that claim is statutory—as is the case here—then it is properly decided by a \nsingle district court judge. The Page holding thus has no bearing on this case. Indeed, Defendant \nhas not identified a single case in which a three-judge court considered an action in which Plaintiffs \nbrought only a Section 2 claim.   \n  Further, as the Page court pointed out, certain sections of the Voting Rights Act specifically \nrequire a three-judge panel to be convened. See 52 U.S.C. § 10304 (“Any action under this section \n[5] shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 9 of 14\nsection 2284 of Title 28 and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.”); see also 52 U.S.C. § \n10306 (with respect to the statutory prohibition on the payment of poll taxes, “[t]he district courts \nof the United States shall have jurisdiction of such actions which shall be heard and determined by \na court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of Title 28 and any appeal \nshall lie to the Supreme Court”). Section 2 does not contain similar language. In response, \nDefendant contends that when 28 U.S.C. § 2284 was narrowed in 1976 to require that three-judge \ncourts hear challenges to the “constitutionality” of apportionment plans, there was no cause of \naction for apportionment plans under Section 2 because the 1982 amendments to the VRA had not \nyet been passed.3 But even if apportionment plans were not commonly challenged under Section \n2 until after the 1982 amendments to the VRA, Congress has had more than three decades to amend \neither Section 2 or 28 U.S.C. § 2284 to mandate that Section 2 claims (or more generally, VRA \nclaims) be decided by a three-judge court. It has not done so. Accordingly, the plain language of \nSection 2 and the three-judge statute must govern.     \n  Defendant concludes his brief by stating that to his knowledge, “no decision from this \nCircuit, or any other, answers the specific question presented here.” Not. of Juris. Issue at 4. \nUndoubtedly, the reason why this issue has not come up in litigation is because the plain language \nof the three-judge statute is clear: Section 2 claims are statutory, and thus 28 U.S.C. § 2284 does \n                                                 \n3 As discussed above, Defendant’s assertion that there was no cause of action under Section 2 for \nvote dilution in the redistricting context prior to the 1982 amendments to the VRA is irrelevant \nbecause the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284 makes clear that it does not apply to actions that \ncontain only statutory claims. In addition, however, Defendant’s underlying claim that Section 2 \nwas not available for reapportionment challenges prior to 1982 seems dubious at best. See, e.g., \nU.S. v. Uvalde Consol. Independent School Dist., 625 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1980) (Section 2 “was \nintended to provide the Attorney General with a means of combatting the use of at-large \ndistricting plans to dilute the Mexican-American vote[,]” and thus complaint stated cause of \naction).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 10 of 14\nnot apply. This Court should follow the plain language of 28 U.S.C. § 2284 and find that this case \nis properly before a single district court judge.  \nB.  Plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint that moots Defendant’s motion to \ndismiss based on standing. \n \nDefendant contends that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not alleged that they \n“would actually or even likely” reside in the second majority African-American congressional \ndistrict that Plaintiffs seek as a remedy to the Section 2 violation. ECF No. 11 (“Mot. to Dismiss”) \nat 5. Once again, however, Defendant’s argument rests on his mistaken conflation of Section 2 \nclaims  with  racial  gerrymandering  claims,  each  of  which  has  very  different  standards  for \nestablishing standing. Voters who live in both “cracked” and “packed” districts have standing to \nbring a challenge under Section 2. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46 n. 11 (vote dilution “may be caused by \nthe dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters or \nfrom the concentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority”). The \nSouthern District of Florida described the standing requirement for a Section 2 plaintiff as the \nobligation to “show that he or she (1) is registered to vote and resides in the district where the \ndiscriminatory dilution occurred; and (2) is a member of the minority group whose voting strength \nwas diluted. Broward for Fair Districts v. Broward County, 2012 WL 1110053 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 3, \n2012).  \nCourts have routinely held that Section 2 plaintiffs (including those who live in existing \nmajority-minority districts) satisfy standing requirements where they allege that they “reside in a \nreasonably compact area that could support additional [majority-minority districts or “MMDs”].” \nSee, e.g., Pope v. Cty. of Albany, No. 1:11-CV-0736, 2014 WL 316703, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, \n2014) (“Here, Plaintiffs have identified a personalized injury: that the apportionment of 4 MMDs \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 11 of 14\nto the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population, as opposed to the 5 \nMMDs that Plaintiffs contend are required by the VRA, dilutes Plaintiffs’ individual voting power-\nincluding those in existing MMDs.”). The “personalized injury” that Section 2 plaintiffs face is \ndilution of their “individual voting power” by the creation of fewer majority-minority districts for \nthe “sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population.” Id. The State’s \nfailure to create the additional majority-minority districts “that Plaintiffs contend are required by \nthe VRA,” and the resulting dilution of plaintiffs’ individual voting power, confers sufficient injury \nfor plaintiffs to litigate their claims. Id.  \nDefendant’s standing challenge, by contrast, rests on the standing rule established for racial \ngerrymandering claims brought under the Equal Protection Clause, not Section 2. See Mot. to \nDismiss at 3 (citing United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995)). But the voters in Hays lacked \nstanding “because they did not challenge the constitutionality of their own district or area.” Pope, \n2014 WL 316703, at *6. Just as in Pope, Plaintiffs here, “in addition to making their claim under \nSection 2 as opposed to the Fourteenth Amendment, challenge the drawing of district lines in a \ncompact area” where they reside. Id.  Defendant’s failure to cite a Section 2 case in support of his \nargument, let alone articulate the proper bases for Section 2 standing, reveals the fundamental \nflaws in his argument.  \nIn any event, Plaintiffs have now filed an Amended Complaint to clearly allege that they \nlive  in  geographic  areas  that  could  constitute  part  of  a  new  majority  African-American \ncongressional district in Alabama as a remedy for the Section 2 violation. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, \n14, 18, 19, 21, 22; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B) (a party may amend as a matter of course \nwithin 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 15   Filed 07/23/18   Page 12 of 14\nor (f), whichever is earlier). Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs lack standing is therefore now \nmoot. See Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V Olympia Voyager, 463 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir. 2006) (an \namended complaint supersedes the original complaint, and thus renders moot a motion to dismiss \nthe original complaint).4  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court deny Defendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss and find that this case is properly before a single district judge.  \n                                                 \n4 In a footnote, Defendant purports to “reserve[] the right” to raise an argument for dismissal in a \nsubsequent motion, citing to an argument raised by a defendant in another jurisdiction. Mot. to \nDismiss at 6 n.2. But Defendant may not raise arguments in support of a second Rule 12(b) \nmotion to dismiss that he could have raised in his first motion to dismiss. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h). \nAdditionally, Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs failed to properly allege the first Gingles \nprecondition is both demonstrably false and in any event now moot. See Am.

See Tamiami Partners, Ltd. v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla., 63\nF.3d 1030, 1046 n. 51 (11th Cir. 1995) (characterizing the complaint at issue as “a\nquintessential shotgun pleading, replete with vague and cursory allegations”);\nPelletier v.

Shelby County v.\nHolder, 570 U.S. 529, 552-53 (2013). They allege that discrimination by\nmunicipalities is relevant in a challenge to a State law (see doc. 14 ¶ 78, recounting\nactions by the City of Evergreen), and they allege that this law should be viewed\nwith suspicion because of laws that courts held not to be discriminatory (see doc. 14\n¶ 82, complaining of a legal challenge to a photo ID law in which the District Court\nenteredsummaryjudgmentfortheStateongroundsthatthelawdidnotdiscriminate\nagainst minority voters). They allege acts by private citizens, a Presidential\ncandidate, and a Senatorial candidate rejected by Alabama voters, even though such\nacts have no probative value in ascertaining the motivations of the Alabama\nLegislature. See doc. 14 ¶¶ 89-90. Many paragraphs contain numerous factual\nallegations,someofwhicharetrueandsomeofwhicharenot,mixedinwithgeneral\nconclusory comments on Alabama history.\nAll of this makes it a challenge to respond to the Amended Complaint; as\nnoted below, Secretary Merrill cannot even respond to some of the most general\nparagraphs in their current form.

The Secretary expressly\nreserves the right to challenge any petition for costs and/or any award of attorneys’\nfees.\nAffirmative Defenses\n1. The Secretary denies any allegation in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint\nthat is not expressly admitted above.\n2. This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claim,\nwhich should be properly submitted to a three-judge court for adjudication. See 28\nU.S.C. § 2254 (“[a] district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise\nrequired by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 17   Filed 08/06/18   Page 19 of 21\nconstitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the\napportionment of any statewide legislative body”).\n3. Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts that would entitle them\nto relief, as they have not alleged that a reasonably compact second majority-\nminority Congressional district can be drawn.\n4. To the extent that Section 2 would require a racial gerrymander to\ncreate a second majority-minority district, it is unconstitutional.\n5. Plaintiffsseekinappropriaterelief,includingreliefthatisnotwithinthe\nSecretary of State’s authority to accomplish, although he is the only named\ndefendant in this case. Secretary Merrill has no authority to draw a second majority-\nminority Congressional district, or any other form of district.\n6. Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by laches.\n7. Plaintiffs Bobby DuBose, Rodney Love, and Janice Williams lack\nstanding to pursue their claims based on the facts alleged. Drawing an additional\nmajority-minority district “anywhere . . . as long as racially polarized voting exists\nwhere the district is ultimately drawn” does not remedy the injury of an individual\nresiding elsewhere. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 916–17 (1996). Such a proposed\nremedy misconceives the nature of a vote-dilution claim as belonging “to the\nminorityas a group and not to its individual members. It does not.” Id. at 917. These\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 17   Filed 08/06/18   Page 20 of 21\nPlaintiffs do not request that their own district be redrawn, so that their alleged\ninjuries cannot be remedied even if the Court grants the relief they purport to seek.\n8. Plaintiff John Harris lacks standing to pursue his claim because he has\nfailed to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that the injuryhe purportedlysuffered\nwould be remedied by the relief sought, namely, that he would reside in a second\nmajority-minority district if one were drawn.\nRespectfully submitted,\nSteve Marshall\nAttorney General\nJames W.

P. 26(f); and in appropriate cases, to consider whether to consent to\nthe exercise of Magistrate Judge jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\nIf  the  parties  are  unable  to  agree  upon  a  date,  time,  or  place  for  such\nconference, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet at 10:00 a.m. on the last Friday\nfalling within the 30 day period in the chambers of the undersigned judge.  If use of\nthe court’s chambers is required, counsel should telephone chambers at least seven\ndays prior to the required meeting to advise the court.  If a party is proceeding without\ncounsel, the obligation to telephone chambers rests upon counsel for the opposing\nparty.\nA. Form of Report\nThe court expects a report of the parties’ planning meeting, in the general\nformat of Fed. R. Civ. P. Form 52 to be jointly filed with the Clerk of Court by the\nparties within fourteen  days after the meeting.  Should the parties disagree about an\nitem, the positions of the parties as to that item should be clearly set forth in separate\nparagraphs.    \nPage 2 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 3 of 22\nThe report also should contain a synopsis of the case advising the court of\nthe general claims and defenses of the parties.  When preparing the report, be\naware that the case should be ready for trial within twelve months from the date of\nservice of the complaint unless extraordinary circumstances exist.  Note that the\nburden lies on the parties to explain why the case cannot be tried within that time\nframe.  \nUpon receipt of the report, the court may enter a scheduling order without\nconducting a separate Rule 16(b) scheduling conference.  The parties should notify\nthe court if they believe a Rule 16(b) conference is necessary.  Upon receipt of the\nreport,  the court will set a Rule 16(b) conference to be held either in person, by\ntelephone, or by other sophisticated electronic means.\nA discovery plan must state the parties' views and proposals on:\n1)  any issues about disclosure, discovery, or preservation of electronically\nstored information, including the form or forms in which it should be produced; and,\n2)   any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation\nmaterials.  If  the parties agree on a procedure to assert these claims after production\n(i.e. a \"Clawback\" Agreement),  the report should include a statement whether they\nwant the court's scheduling order to adopt their agreement under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 502.  \nPage 3 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 4 of 22\nB. Compliance with HIPAA\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996),\nand regulations promulgated thereto, when “protected health information” is relevant\nto the claims or defenses presented in an action, the party seeking such “protected\nhealth information” shall present a valid authorization at the Rule 26 planning\nmeeting to be executed by the party from whom such “protected health information”\nis sought.  The parties shall include in their report a deadline (specific date) by which\nthe authorization will be executed.  The parties may file with the court a motion for \na “qualified protective order,” to which all parties stipulate, and, contemporaneously\nwith  that  filing,  e-mail  to  bowdre_chambers@alnd.uscourts.gov,  a  proposed\n\"qualified protective order,\" in substantially the form attached to this order as\nAppendix I, to be entered by stipulation of counsel for all parties.\nC. Suitability of Action for Alternative Dispute Resolution\nAll parties should give early consideration to the possibility of settlement to\navoid unnecessary costs and fees.  The court requires that the attorneys for all parties\nmake an early analysis of the case along with their clients and be prepared to discuss\nsettlement at an early date.  The parties shall also consider and discuss whether this\naction may be suitable for  mediation, whether under the court’s ADR plan or\nPage 4 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 5 of 22\notherwise.\nIf any party thinks that a settlement conference with the court at any stage\nwould be conducive to settlement, that party may make a written request that the\ncourt conduct such a conference.  The results of all these discussions shall be\nincluded in the report of the parties’ planning meeting to be filed with the court.\nEach attorney is directed to immediately forward a copy of  the Initial Order\nto his or her client.  Plaintiff(s)’ attorney(s) are ORDERED to immediately discuss\nthe feasibility of settlement with Defendant(s)’ attorney(s).\nD. Commencement of Discovery\nThe parties are authorized to commence discovery pursuant to the terms of\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 immediately after the required report has been\nfiled.  In cases removed from state court in which any discovery requests were filed\nbefore such removal, those discovery requests shall be deemed to have been filed on\nthe date the report required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f) is filed in this court.  \nThe parties may elect, but are not required, to file discovery notices, requests\nand responses with the Clerk of Court.  Even if the discovery notice or request is filed\nwith the Clerk of Court, the discovery response does not have to be filed.  Counsel\nare reminded to review the court's  Administrative Procedures Manuals for electronic\nfiling (on the court's website) for the importance of redacting or sealing personal\nPage 5 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 6 of 22\nidentifiers (e.g., Social Security numbers, drivers' license numbers, birth dates,\naddresses, telephone numbers, bank account and credit card information) and other\npersonal or sensitive information, in compliance with the E-Government Act.\nE. Dismissal of Non-Served Defendants\nTake Notice:  Any defendant who has not been served with a summons and\ncomplaint within 90 days after the filing of the complaint (or within 90 days after the\nparty was added to the action) may be dismissed without further order of the court\nunless prior to such time the party on whose behalf such service is required shows\ngood cause why service has not been perfected.\nF. Hand Deliveries\nIf counsel wishes to provide the court with a courtesy copy of a motion or brief,\nor if an order of this court requires submission of a copy in addition to the original,\nsuch copy shall be clearly identified as a \"courtesy copy\" and left in the Clerk's Office\nfor delivery to the court's chambers.  SUCH COPY SHOULD BE DOUBLE\nSIDED.  All hand deliveries, unless otherwise instructed, are to be made to the\nClerk's Office.   Fax copies are not accepted.\nG. Electronic Submissions\nSince January 3, 2005, the official record of the court has been the electronic\ndocket maintained pursuant to CM/ECF.  Except in extraordinary circumstances, all\nPage 6 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 7 of 22\nfilings shall be consistent with the court’s Administrative Procedures Manuals for\ncivil and criminal cases.  Attorneys are required to register for electronic filing and\nservice  through  the  “Attorney  Registration”  link  on  the  court’s  website,\nwww.alnd.uscourts.gov.  Once an attorney has so registered, his or her registration\nbecomes permanent, and he or she is not required to re-register in each individual\ncase.  Documents filed through CM/ECF must be in pdf (Portable Document Format).\nAs part of the CM/ECF system, the court has established a “chamber’s email\naddress” for each judicial officer.  The address for the undersigned judge’s chambers\nis bowdre_chambers@alnd.uscourts.gov.  This chambers email address has been\nestablished to enable counsel to submit proposed orders or other requested documents\nto the judge in Word or WordPerfect format, or otherwise to communicate with the\njudge on matters directly related to a case.  Non-case-related communications\nshould NOT be sent to the chambers email address.  Ex parte communications are\nnot acceptable; all communications to the chambers email address must show a copy\nto all opposing counsel or pro se parties.  Counsel should send communications to the\nchambers email address only if the court is being requested to do something; counsel\nshould not copy the chambers email address with communications, arguments,\ndebates or other matters occurring solely between counsel.\nPage 7 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 8 of 22\nII. ATTORNEY FEE SHIFTING CASES\nIf a party anticipates that during or upon the completion of this action it may\nfor any reason (other than as a sanction under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)\nseek an award of attorneys' fees from the opposing party pursuant to any statute or\nother law, the party must  comply with the following requirements as a precondition\nto any such award:\n(a) Counsel must maintain a separate record of time with a complete and\naccurate accounting of all time devoted to this particular action (to the nearest\n1/10 of an hour), recorded contemporaneously with the time expended, for\neach attorney and with sufficient detail to disclose the nature of the work\nperformed in the action (i.e., not just \"research\" but the specific matter being\nresearched; not just “conference” but identity of persons conferring and general\nsubject matter of the conference). \n(b) If a claim will be made for services performed by any person not a\nmember of the bar, a separate time record shall be maintained for each such\nindividual in accordance with (a) above.\n(c) Counsel is DIRECTED to review and verify all attorney and non-\nattorney time records no less than once per month. \n(d) Although the court does not require counsel to file a copy of the time\nrecords prior to a request for a fee, counsel may file with the clerk of the court\neither a copy of the time record referred to in (a) above, or a separately\nprepared document setting forth the information described in (a) above.  If\ncounsel elects to file reports, they should be filed by the 15th day of the month\nfollowing the month in which the work was performed during the pendency of\nthe case.  If counsel elects to file time reports, the material filed  may be filed\nunder seal, subject to further court order, by placing the same in a sealed\nenvelope with the case name and number along with \"ATTORNEY TIME\nRECORDS - FILE UNDER SEAL\" written thereon.  However, if the material\nPage 8 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 9 of 22\nis filed under seal, then the filing party must, at the time of such filing, also file\n(and serve a copy on opposing parties or their counsel) a document stating the\ntotal of the hours represented by the sealed filing, allocated as to total attorney\nhours and total non-attorney hours included in the current filing under seal. \nUpon the conclusion of this case, without further order the seal will be lifted\nas to all attorney fee materials filed under seal.\n(e) A  Petition  for  Attorney  Fees  shall  be  accompanied  by  Counsel’s\nCertification that   all  time  records  are  accurate;  that such records were\nprepared contemporaneously with the performance of the work for which the\nfees are claimed; and that Counsel reviewed and verified all attorney and non-\nattorney time records no less frequently than once per month.\nTake Notice:  Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements will\nnormally result  in attorneys’ fees being disallowed.\n   III. CASES THAT REQUIRE EEOC CHARGES\nIf this case is one in which the filing of a charge of discrimination with the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission or similar agency is required as a\nprerequisite to suit, then the PLAINTIFF(S) MUST file with the Clerk of Court at\nthe time of filing the disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1):  (A) a copy of\nall charges of discrimination filed with the EEOC and which form the bases of the\naction; and (B) a copy of the EEOC’s response to all such charges of discrimination\nfiled with that agency, including the notice of right to sue.  \nPage 9 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 10 of 22\nIV. MOTION PRACTICE\nA. Summary Judgment Motions\nAny motion(s) for summary judgment filed in this action must comply with all\nrequirements of Appendix II to this order.\nB. Motions (Other than Dispositive Motions and Motions to Remand)\nPrior to filing any motion (other than a dispositive motion or a motion to\nremand)  in  this  case,  moving  counsel  shall  contact  the  opposing  counsel  and\ndetermine if  counsel will oppose the motion.  All motions SHALL include, in the\ncaption under the case number, a notation that the motion is either \"Opposed\" or\n\"Unopposed.\"  The first paragraph SHALL briefly summarize the parties' attempts\nto resolve the issue(s) and set forth areas of agreement and disagreement.  Failure of\nthe parties to abide by these requirements can result in a sua sponte denial of the\nmotions for failure to comply.  \nC. Motion of Counsel to Withdraw\nOnce an attorney has appeared as counsel for a party, he or she may not\nwithdraw from the action merely by filing a \"notice of withdrawal,\" but must file a\nmotion seeking permission of the court to do so, explicitly stating the grounds\ntherefor.    Any  motion  to  withdraw  which,  if  granted,  would  leave  a  party\nunrepresented by counsel must include a certification that the moving attorney has\nPage 10 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 11 of 22\nserved a copy of the motion on his or her client and has informed the client of the\nright to promptly file an objection with the court.  The motion must also include the\nnotation, \"Future notice to (name of party) is to be made at the following address:\n(state last known address of the party).\"\nD.

The text of briefs must be double-spaced (except for\nquotations exceeding fifty words, which may be block indented from the left and right\nmargins and single spaced) using fourteen point typeface, preferably Times New\nPage 15 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 16 of 22\nRoman. \nB. Number Submitted\nThe parties must electronically file the original brief.   The parties also shall\ne-mail to the court’s chambers (Bowdre_chambers@alnd.uscourts.gov) such brief in\nWord or WordPerfect format, contemporaneously with the filing of the brief.  For\nrequirements about the submission of courtesy copies of evidentiary materials see the\nsubsequent section.\nC. Binding\nThe Clerk will not accept bound materials for filing, but the court’s “courtesy\ncopy” of the brief must be securely bound (e.g. by three-ring binder or large clip) for\nease of use, and, to prevent inadvertent loss of pages.  In addition, all pages submitted\nin the court’s “courtesy copy” shall be three-hole punched.\nD. Manner of Stating Facts\nAll briefs submitted either in support of or opposition to a motion must begin\nwith a statement of allegedly undisputed relevant material facts set out in separately\nnumbered paragraphs.  Counsel must state facts in clear, unambiguous, simple,\ndeclarative sentences.  All statements of fact must be supported by specific reference\nto evidentiary submissions.  All facts argued in the argument section of the brief\nshould be included in statement of facts or the failure to do so may mean that the\nPage 16 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 17 of 22\ncourt  disregards that argument.  \n1. Moving Party’s Initial Statement of Facts\nThe moving party shall list in separately numbered paragraphs each material\nfact the movant contends is true and not in genuine dispute, and upon which the\nmoving party relies to demonstrate that it is entitled to summary judgment.  Each such\nstatement must be followed by a specific reference to those portions of the evidentiary\nrecord that the movant claims supports it.2 \n2. Opposing Party’s Statement of Facts\nEach party opposing a summary judgment motion also must submit a statement\nof facts divided as follows.\na. Response to Movant’s Statement of Facts\nThe first section must consist of only the non-moving party’s disputes, if any,\nwith the moving party’s claimed undisputed facts.   The non-moving party’s response\nto the moving party’s claimed undisputed facts shall be in separately numbered\nparagraphs that coincide with those of the moving party’s claimed undisputed facts. \nAny statements of fact that are disputed by the non-moving party must be followed\nby a specific reference to those portions of the evidentiary record upon which the\n2\n  Each statement of fact should be supported by its own evidentiary citation, regardless of the fact that more\nthan one statement of fact allegedly is supported by the same specific reference to the evidentiary record or more\nthan one statement of fact is contained in the same numbered paragraph.\nPage 17 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 18 of 22\ndispute is based.  All material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving\nparty  will  be  deemed  to  be  admitted  for  summary  judgment  purposes  unless\ncontroverted by the response of the party opposing summary judgment.\nb. Additional Undisputed Facts\nThe second section may contain additional, allegedly undisputed facts set out\nin separately numbered paragraphs that the opposing party contends require the\ndenial of summary judgment.  The second section of the opposing party’s statement\nof facts, if any, shall be clearly designated as such.3  The opposing party should\ninclude only facts which the opposing party contends are true and not in genuine\ndispute.\nc. Additional Disputed Facts\nThe third section may contain additional, allegedly disputed  facts set out in\nseparately numbered paragraphs that the opposing  party contends  require the denial\nof summary judgment.  The third section of the opposing party’s statement of facts,\nif any, shall be clearly designated as such.  Each statement of allegedly disputed facts\nmust be followed by specific reference to those portions of the evidentiary record\n3\nEach statement of fact should be supported by its own evidentiary citation, regardless of the fact that more\nthan one statement of fact allegedly is supported by the same specific reference to the evidentiary record or more\nthan one statement of fact is contained in the same numbered paragraph..\nPage 18 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 19 of 22\nwhich both support and contradict the alleged fact.4 \n3. Moving Party’s Reply\nThe reply submission, if any, shall consist of only the moving party’s disputes,\nif any, with the non-moving party’s additional claimed undisputed facts.   The moving\nparty’s response to the non-moving party’s additional claimed undisputed facts shall\nbe in separately numbered paragraphs that coincide with those of the non-moving\nparty’s additional claimed undisputed facts. Any statements of fact that are disputed\nby the moving party must be followed by a specific reference to those portions of the\nevidentiary record upon which the disputation is based.   All additional material facts\nset forth in the statement required of the opposing parties will be deemed to be\nadmitted for summary judgment purposes unless controverted by the statement of the\nmovant.\nThe court reserves the right sua sponte to STRIKE any statements of fact\nor responsive statements that fail to comply with these requirements.\n4\n The court recognizes that, in some circumstances, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment may\nwant to set out facts which that party claims are true and supported by evidence, but cannot, in good conscience and\nconsistent with Rule 11, say are undisputed.  In such case, the party should include a separate section of fact\nstatements, set out in short declarative sentences and individually numbered paragraphs, which are supported by\nsome evidence but, nevertheless, are in dispute.  When doing so, however, the party should include record citations\nwhich both support and contradict the alleged fact.\nPage 19 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 20 of 22\nREQUIREMENTS FOR EVIDENTIARY MATERIALS\nThe  parties  must  electronically  file,  simultaneously  with  their  briefs,  all\nevidentiary materials (e.g., affidavits, exhibits, depositions, or other products of\ndiscovery) relied upon in support of or opposition to summary judgment motions,\nexcept those materials included in the moving party’s initial evidentiary submission\nmay be referenced by any party opposing the motion, without re-submitting additional\ncopies of the same documents. \nWhile the court reserves the right to consider evidentiary materials that are not\nspecifically referenced in the brief, no party has a right to assume the court will\nconsider such materials.  A specific reference must include the exhibit number, page,\nand, when appropriate, the line number.\nA. Organization\nEach volume of evidentiary materials must include a table of contents that\nincludes a brief narrative description of each document included:  e.g., “Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 1, the Deposition of John Jones.”  For ease of citation, each affidavit, exhibit,\ndeposition, or other product of discovery must be separately identified by a capital\nletter or numeral (i.e., “Exhibit A” or “Exhibit 1”); and, if the exhibit contains more\nPage 20 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 21 of 22\nthan one page, each page must be separately numbered.5  Counsel are directed to\nsubmit entire depositions, even if relying only on excerpts, including all exhibits\nto the depositions.\nDeposition travel transcripts that are submitted as part of the evidentiary record\nshould include no more than four pages of deposition text per 8½” by 11” page.\nB. Number of Sets Submitted\nThe parties must electronically file one set of evidentiary materials.  The\nparties must simultaneously submit to the Clerk of Court, for delivery to the court’s\nchambers by the Clerk, an exact copy of the filed set of evidentiary materials, clearly\nidentified as a \"courtesy copy.\"  Except for the binding, there must be no differences\nbetween the filed materials and the \"courtesy copy.\"  The courtesy copy of the\nevidentiary material must be a copy of the filed motion and must include a document\nnumber and corresponding page number on each filed page.  Additionally, the\nevidentiary material should include a tab corresponding to each document.  Regarding\ncourtesy copies of depositions, parties shall include all exhibits to the depositions\nwith sub-tabs, clearly labeled.  \n5\n A reference to that exhibit in the statement of facts or brief might be, “Plaintiff’s Ex. 1, p. 41.”  The court\ndoes not, however, require any specific form as long as specific page references are used.\nPage 21 of  22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 18   Filed 08/08/18   Page 22 of 22\nC. Binding\nThe Clerk will not accept bound materials for filing, but the court’s copy of the\nevidentiary submission must be securely bound — in separately numbered volumes,\nif necessary — for ease of use and to prevent inadvertent loss of pages.\nPage 22 of  22",

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \nLAKEISHA CHESTNUT, et al.,  ) \n  ) \n  Plaintiffs,  ) \n    ) \n  v.  )  Case No. 2:18-CV-00907-KOB \n    )   \nJOHN H. MERRILL,  ) \n    ) \n  Defendant.  ) \n \nORDER \n \n  This matter comes before the court on Defendant Alabama Secretary of State John \nMerrill’s amended request for taxation of costs.  (Doc. 124).  Secretary Merrill requests taxed \ncosts after prevailing in the instant case.  Plaintiffs argue that Secretary Merrill’s request for \ncosts must be denied as untimely.  The court finds that, because of the extenuating circumstance \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, justice supports the grant of Secretary Merrill’s request for costs.  \n  On March 17, 2020, this court entered a memorandum opinion and order finding the \ninstant case moot and dismissing it.  (Doc. 121; doc. 122).  On April 10, 2020—24 days after the \ncourt dismissed the case and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic—Secretary Merrill filed \nhis first Bill of Costs.  (Doc. 123).  Later, on April 22, 2020, Secretary Merrill filed a motion to \namend or correct the Bill of Costs because the first filing had been inaccurate.  (Doc. 124).  The \ncourt granted the motion to amend.  (Doc. 124).  Plaintiffs then filed a response contesting the \nrequest for costs because it was filed three days too late.  (Doc. 127).   \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 provides that “[u]nless a federal statute, these rules, or \na court order provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the \nprevailing party.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1).  The Eleventh Circuit has held that this language \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 129     Filed 05/04/20     Page 2 of 3\n“establishes a presumption that costs are to be awarded to a prevailing party, but vests the district \ncourt with discretion to decide otherwise.”  Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1038 (11th \nCir. 2000).  Although district courts may exercise discretion in denying costs, a district court \nmust state a “sound basis” for overcoming the presumption that costs should be awarded.  Id. at \n1039.   \n  Rule 54 does not set a deadline for seeking costs; instead, “district courts generally \nimpose such limits through local rule.”  Barber v. Hood, No. 2:15-CV-00997-JHE, 2019 WL \n3997069, at *9 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 23, 2019).  In this district, the local rules state that “[r]equests \nfor taxation of costs (other than attorneys' fees) under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) shall be filed with the \nClerk within 21 days after entry of judgment.”  L.R. 54.1.  Neither Rule 54 nor Local Rule 54.1 \nprescribes any penalty for failure to timely file a request for costs.   \n  The Eleventh Circuit gives “great deference to a district court's interpretation of its local \nrules.”  Clark v. Housing Auth., 971 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir. 1992).  Interpreting Local Rule \n54.1, a colleague on this court found that the presumption in favor of awarding costs can merit \ntreating as timely a request for costs that was not properly, timely filed.  Equal Employment \nOpportunity Comm'n v. Riverview Animal Clinic, P.C., No. 2:09-CV-01950-AKK, 2011 WL \n13229387, at *3 (N.D. Ala. June 23, 2011) (Kallon, J.).  In light of the lack of penalties for \nuntimely filing in the Rules, this court exercises similar discretion and interprets the Rules to \nallow the award of costs even where the request was untimely filed during extraordinary \ncircumstances.  \n  In the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the court cannot state a “sound basis” for \novercoming the presumption of the award of costs.  See Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1039.  Both the \ndeadline for filing costs and Secretary Merrill’s belated request for costs came at a time of global \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 129     Filed 05/04/20     Page 3 of 3\nupheaval as the COVID-19 pandemic developed into an international crisis resulting in business \nclosures and stay-at-home orders.  The pandemic has had such an extreme effect on the country, \nincluding the judiciary, that Chief Judge Coogler of this court entered a general order on March \n17, 2020—the same day the court dismissed this case—temporarily suspending unexpired \ndiscovery deadlines and briefing schedules in civil cases.  See “General Order,” In re: Court \nOperations During the Public Health Emergency Caused by the COVID-19 Virus, March 17, \n2020, https://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/sites/alnd/files/General%20Order%20-\n%20Court%20Operations%20During%20the%20Public%20Health%20Emergency%20Caused%\n20By%20the%20COVID-19%20Virus%20effective%20March%2017%2C%202020.pdf.    \n  Even in that atmosphere, Secretary Merrill filed his request for costs only three days \nlate—a time frame unlikely to create any significant prejudice.  Against the tapestry formed by \ntruly extraordinary circumstances, minor delay, a presumption in favor of the grant of costs, and \nthe lack of a clear penalty for belated filing, this court finds that equity supports the award of \ncosts to Secretary Merrill in this case despite his untimely request.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1); \nL.R. 54.1; Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1038–39. \n  The Plaintiffs in this case did not dispute the amount of any of the costs submitted by \nSecretary Merrill.  Accordingly, the court GRANTS Secretary Merrill’s amended request for \ncosts.  The court ORDERS the Clerk to enter a separate taxation of costs.   \nDONE and ORDERED this 4th day of May, 2020.  \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nKARON OWEN BOWDRE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n3 \n ",

COOPER, acting in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746, \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B), and Federal Rules of Evidence 702 \nand 703, does hereby declare and say: \n \nI. INTRODUCTION  \n1.  My name is William S. Cooper.  I have a B.A. in Economics from \nDavidson College.  As a private consultant, I currently serve as a demographic and \nredistricting expert for the Plaintiffs.  I am compensated at a rate of $150 per hour. \n(a) Redistricting Experience \n2.  I have testified at trial as an expert witness on redistricting and \ndemographics in federal courts in about 40 voting rights cases since the late 1980s.  \nFour of these lawsuits resulted in changes to statewide legislative boundaries: Rural \nWest Tennessee African-American Affairs v. McWherter, Old Person v. Cooney, \n2:18-cv-00907-KOB\n11/04/2019 Bench Trial\nPlaintiff Exhibit No. 1\nExhibit 1 pg 1 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 2 of 43\nBone Shirt v. Hazeltine, and Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v Alabama. \nApproximately 25 of the cases led to changes in local election district plans.1 \n3.  During the 2010 redistricting cycle, five plans that I developed for local \ngovernment clients were adopted – Bolivar County, Mississippi; Claiborne County, \nMississippi; the City of Grenada, Mississippi; Sussex County, Virginia; and \nWenatchee, Washington. \n4.  I served as a redistricting consultant in 2011 to the Miami-Dade County \nCommission and Board of Education.  I currently serve as a consultant and expert \nwitness for the City of Decatur, Alabama defendants in Voketz v. City of Decatur.  \n5.  Since 2011, based in part on my testimony, five federal courts have found \na Section 2 violation based on the first prerequisite (Gingles 1) pursuant to \nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986): Montes v. City of Yakima, Washington \n(E.D. Wash. Aug. 22, 2014); Pope v. Albany County, New York (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, \n2014; N.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2015); NAACP v. Ferguson-Florissant School District, \nMissouri (E. D. Mo. August 22, 2016); Terrebonne Parish Branch NAACP et al. v. \nJindal et al. (M.D. La. July 27, 2017); and Thomas v. Bryant  (S.D. Ms. Feb 16, \n2019).  \n                                                 \n1 I have served as an expert witness on demographics in non-voting trials. For example, in an \nApril 2017 opinion in Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education (Case no.2:65-cv-00396-\nMHH), a school desegregation case involving the City of Gardendale, Alabama, the court made \nextensive reference to my testimony.  \n  2 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 2 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 3 of 43\n6.  In 2016, two redistricting plans that I developed on behalf of the plaintiffs \nfor consent decrees in Section 2 lawsuits in Georgia were adopted– NAACP v. \nFayette County, Georgia and NAACP v. Emanuel County, Georgia. \n7.  In February 2019, a plan I developed on behalf of the plaintiffs in Thomas \nv. Bryant (S.D.

The attorneys for the Plaintiffs in this case asked me to determine whether \nthe African American population in Alabama is “sufficiently large and \ngeographically compact”2  to allow for the creation of two U.S. House majority-\nBlack districts – one more than under the current 7-district plan (the “2011 Plan”). \n10. In addition, for background, the attorneys asked me to review historical \nand current demographics (reported in the decennial Census and annual estimates \npublished by the U.S. Census Bureau), as well as socioeconomic characteristics \n                                                 \n2 Thornburg v.

Exhibit B describes the sources and methodology I have employed in the \npreparation of this report. \n(c) 2011 Board of Education Plan \n12. The current 8-district Board of Education Plan (the “2011 BOE Plan”), \nwhich was adopted by the Alabama Legislature after the release of the 2010 \nCensus, provides a useful backdrop for the Gingles 1 analysis here.4  \n13.  The 2011 BOE Plan is shown in the map in Figure 1 (on the next page). \nExhibit C-1 is a map of the 2011 BOE Plan prepared by the State.5 \n                                                 \n3 In this report, “Black” and “African American” are synonymous, as are “Latino” and \n“Hispanic”. \n4 Joint public redistricting hearings for the new post-2010 congressional, legislative, and \nBoard of Education election plans were held in April and May of 2011. \n \nSource: http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/isd/ALReap_MeetingsNotices.aspx \n5  Source:  \nhttp://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/Legislature/2011_State_Board_of_Education_Districts.pdf \n \n  4 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 4 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 5 of 43\nFigure 1  \n                Alabama – State Board of Education Plan \n \n \n14.  According to the 2010 Census, BOE District 4 is 51.4% Black voting \nage population (“BVAP”) and District 5 is 57.5% BVAP.6 The ideal BOE district \nsize is 597,467. The 2011 BOE Plan has an overall deviation of just 0.28%.  \nExhibit C-2 contains detailed 2010 population statistics by BOE district. \n                                                 \n6\n In this declaration, “African American” or “Black” refers to persons who are Any Part \nBlack (i.e. persons of two or more races and some part Black), including Hispanic Black.  In \nsome instances (e.g. for historical comparisons prior to the 2000 Census), numerical or \npercentage references identify single-race Black as “SR Black”.  \nIt is my understanding that following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft, \n539 U.S. 461 (2003), the “Any Part” definition is the appropriate Census classification to use in \nmost Section 2 cases. \n  5 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 5 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 6 of 43\n15.

As shown in Figure 2, when the two majority-Black BOE districts are \nviewed in conjunction with the county-level spatial distribution of Alabama’s Black \npopulation, a 7-district congressional plan with two majority-Black districts \nbecomes a realistic possibility. \nFigure 2 \n \n          BOE Districts 4 and 5 and Percent Black by County – 2010 Census \n \n  6 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 6 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 7 of 43\n17. For instance, with the inclusion of four counties adjacent to BOE District \n5 – Conecuh (47.02% Black), Butler (43.82% Black), Barbour (47.82% Black), and \nRussell (41.81% Black) –  the BOE District 4 and 5 area shown in Figure 2 has a \ncombined population of 1,308,762 – just 56,290 persons short of the population \nnecessary to create two congressional districts. This area has a BVAP of 53.34%, \naccording to the 2010 Census.  \n18. Against this backdrop, the four illustrative plans I have prepared (see \nSection IV infra) provide demonstrative proof that two majority-Black U.S. House \ndistricts can be drawn that adhere to traditional redistricting principles. \n19. In addition to traditional redistricting principles, the illustrative plans I \nhave developed consider and adhere to the Alabama Legislature’s definition of \ncommunity of interest as set forth in the Reapportionment Committee Guidelines \nfor Congressional, Legislative, and Board of Education Redistricting: \nThe integrity of communities of interest shall be respected to the \nextent feasible. For purposes of these Guidelines, a community of \ninterest is defined as an area with recognized similarities of interests, \nincluding but not limited to racial, ethnic, geographic, governmental, \nregional, social, cultural, partisan, or historic interests; county, \nmunicipal, or voting precinct boundaries; and commonality of \ncommunications.7 \n \n \n                                                 \n7 Source: \nhttp://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/reapportionment/Reapportionment%20Guidelines%2\n0for%20Redistricting.pdf  \n  7 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 7 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 8 of 43\n(d) Expert Summary Conclusions \n \n20. African Americans in Alabama are sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact to allow for two majority-Black U.S. House districts in a 7-\ndistrict plan. \n21. As reported in the 1-Year 2017 American Community Survey, non-\nHispanic Whites significantly outpace African Americans across most key \nindicators of socio-economic well-being. These disparities are found statewide, as \nwell as at the regional level in central and south Alabama. \n(e) Organization of Declaration \n \n22. The remainder of this declaration is organized as follows: Section II \nreviews state and regional demographics; Section III compares the benchmark \n2001 U.S. House Plan and the current 2011 U.S. House Plan; Section IV presents \nfour illustrative plans, which feature a new majority-Black congressional district in \ncentral and south Alabama; Section V reviews socioeconomic disparities by race.  \nII.

The population in Alabama grew by 18.2% between 1990 and 2010 – \nfrom about 4.04 million to 4.78 million. In 1990, minorities represented just over \none-fourth (26.74%) of the population. By 2010, minorities comprised about one-\nthird (32.96%) of Alabama’s population.  \n25. The SR Black population grew by 20.33% between 1990 and 2010, from \n25.26% to 26.18%.   Including the Any Part Black category (first tabulated in the \n2000 Census), African Americans represent 35.23% of the 1990 to 2010 population \n  9 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 9 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 10 of 43\nincrease in Alabama (260,413 AP Black of 739,149 persons).

According to the 2010 Census, about half of Alabama’s Black population \nis concentrated in the urban counties of Jefferson (Black pop. 290,864), Madison \n(Black pop. 94,544), Montgomery (Black pop. 134,781), and Mobile (Black pop. \n152,458). The rural Black Belt counties (excluding urban Black Belt Montgomery \nCounty) account for about 12% of the statewide Black population.8 The counties of \nLee and Tuscaloosa – home to the two largest state universities – contain about 7% \nof the statewide Black population. Taken together, the urban counties, rural Black \nBelt counties, and university counties encompass about 70% of the statewide Black \npopulation. \n27. The map in Figure 4 (on the next page) displays 2010 percent Black by \ncounty, with thick black lines demarcating the Black Belt region. The table in \n                                                 \n8 In this declaration, the term “Black Belt” refers to the following counties: Barbour, \nBullock, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Montgomery, Perry, Sumter, and \nWilcox. This is consistent with my testimony in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v Alabama \nand Alabama State Conference of the NAACP v. Alabama. \n \nFor an overview of Alabama’s Black Belt, including a listing of Black Belt counties under \nvarious definitions, see the article “Black Belt Region in Alabama” by Terance L.

POST-2010 POPULATION ESTIMATES\n29. As shown in Figure 6 (on the next page), U.S. Census Bureau (“Census\nBureau”) estimates indicate that Alabama has a 2017 total population of 4,874,747 \n– an increase of 95,011 persons (1.95%) since 2010.9  The 2017 estimates indicate\nthat the NH White population has fallen by 7,550 persons since 2010, so Alabama’s \npopulation growth since 2010 can be attributed entirely to gains in the overall \nminority population.10 \n9 Census Bureau estimates for 2018 indicate that the statewide population has increased to \n4,887,871. Detailed estimates by race for 2018 are not available as of March 8, 2019. \n10 Sources for 2017 estimates: \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPSR6H/0400000US01?slice=Year~est72017\nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPSR5H/0400000US01?slice=Year~est72017\nThe methodology for Census Bureau annual estimates is explained in documentation at the \nlink below: \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html  \n12\nExhibit 1 pg 12 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 13 of 43\nFigure 6 \n      Alabama –  2017 Estimates \n2017 \nPopulation  Percent  2017 VAP  Percent \nTotal   4,874,747 (cid:1005)(cid:1004)(cid:1004)(cid:856)(cid:1004)(cid:1081) (cid:1007)(cid:853)(cid:1011)(cid:1011)(cid:1013)(cid:853)(cid:1006)(cid:1011)(cid:1008) (cid:1005)(cid:1004)(cid:1004)(cid:856)(cid:1004)(cid:1081)\nNH White  3,196,852 (cid:1010)(cid:1009)(cid:856)(cid:1010)(cid:1081) (cid:1006)(cid:853)(cid:1009)(cid:1010)(cid:1006)(cid:853)(cid:1010)(cid:1010)(cid:1007) (cid:1010)(cid:1011)(cid:856)(cid:1012)(cid:1081)\nTotal Minority  1,677,895 (cid:1007)(cid:1008)(cid:856)(cid:1008)(cid:1081) (cid:1005)(cid:853)(cid:1006)(cid:1005)(cid:1010)(cid:853)(cid:1010)(cid:1005)(cid:1005) (cid:1007)(cid:1006)(cid:856)(cid:1006)(cid:1081)\nLatino   211,058 (cid:1008)(cid:856)(cid:1007)(cid:1081) (cid:1005)(cid:1006)(cid:1011)(cid:853)(cid:1011)(cid:1007)(cid:1007) (cid:1007)(cid:856)(cid:1008)(cid:1081)\nNH Black   1,292,827 (cid:1006)(cid:1010)(cid:856)(cid:1009)(cid:1081) (cid:1013)(cid:1011)(cid:1005)(cid:853)(cid:1013)(cid:1006)(cid:1012) (cid:1006)(cid:1009)(cid:856)(cid:1011)(cid:1081)\nSingle-race Black \n(Including Hispanics)18+   1,308,214 (cid:1006)(cid:1010)(cid:856)(cid:1012)(cid:1081) (cid:1013)(cid:1012)(cid:1005)(cid:853)(cid:1011)(cid:1010)(cid:1005) (cid:1006)(cid:1010)(cid:856)(cid:1004)(cid:1081)\nAny Part Black (Including \nHispanics)   1,348,681 (cid:1006)(cid:1011)(cid:856)(cid:1011)(cid:1081) (cid:1013)(cid:1013)(cid:1010)(cid:853)(cid:1013)(cid:1008)(cid:1012) (cid:1006)(cid:1010)(cid:856)(cid:1008)(cid:1081)\n30.  The Census Bureau estimates that between 2010 and 2017 the African \nAmerican population grew by about 5.27% – an increase of 67,563 persons. African \nAmericans account for 71.1% of the total estimated population growth since 2010. \nAccording to the 2017 population estimates, African Americans represent 27.7% of \nthe statewide population – up by nearly a percentage point from 26.18% in 2010.  \n31. Statewide, the Black voting age population has grown at a faster pace \nthan the overall Black population since 2010 – up by 8.7%, representing an increase \nof 79,448 persons of voting age.  African Americans account for 60.19% of the \nestimated 131,997 increase in VAP between 2010 and 2017.

THE PLAINTIFFS’ ILLUSTRATIVE PLANS \n \nA. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA  \n \n(a) Point of Departure – The 2011 BOE Plan \n \n45. For the past quarter century, more than half of African Americans in \nAlabama have lived in one of the two state Board of Education minority \nopportunity districts. According to the 2000 Census, under the court-ordered 1996 \nBOE Plan, District 4 was 46.61% SR BVAP and BOE District 5 was 51.75% SR \nBVAP. Under the 2001 BOE Plan, BOE District 4 was 47.61% SR BVAP and BOE \nDistrict 5 was 51.97% SR BVAP.13 \n46. Under the 2011 BOE Plan, District 4 and District 5 are both majority-\nBVAP (see ¶¶12-16 supra). According to the 2010 Census, the combined Black \npopulation in these two districts is 683,923, which represents more than half \n(53.38%) of the statewide Black population. \n(b) Area Encompassed by the Illustrative Majority-Black Districts \n47.   Following the lead of the 2011 BOE Plan, the four illustrative plans \ndescribed below create a second majority-BVAP district in central and south \nAlabama. Taken together, the Black population within the two majority-Black \n                                                 \n13  Source: February 2, 2002 Section 5 letter from the Alabama Attorney General to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, available at the Web Archive link below: \n \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20141018111338/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/reapportionment\n/boe/boe.html  \n  20 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 20 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 21 of 43\ncongressional districts under each illustrative plan is about 58% of African \nAmericans statewide. \n48. Figure 12 (on the next page) depicts the area encompassed by the \nillustrative majority-Black districts in the four illustrative plans.  The majority-\nBlack congressional districts are drawn around the same general area as the \nmajority-Black BOE districts (see Figure 2 supra). However, compared to the area \nencompassed by the two majority-Black BOE districts, the illustrative majority-\nBlack congressional districts must expand to account for the larger ideal population \nsize in a 7-district plan – 682,819 – versus 597,467 under an 8-district BOE plan.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  21 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 21 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 22 of 43\nFigure 12 \n Area Encompassed by Illustrative Majority-Black Districts – 2010 Census  \n \n49. There are a variety of ways to draw two majority-Black congressional \ndistricts in Alabama. Thus, the Figure 12 map delineates an area that encompasses \na significantly larger population base than what is necessary for two districts. In the \nFigure 12 map, the combined area of the two majority-Black districts in each of the \nfour illustrative plans (i.e. eight districts with partial overlaps) has a 2010 \npopulation of 1,707,430 – representing a 341,790-person surplus (i.e. two and a half \ndistricts). \n  22 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 22 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 23 of 43\nB. ILLUSTRATIVE PLAN DESCRIPTIONS \n(a) Illustrative Plans – Gingles 1 and Traditional Redistricting Principles \n50. The illustrative plans demonstrate the first Gingles precondition, i.e. the \nBlack population is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to allow for \nthe creation of one additional Black-majority district. \n51. All four illustrative plans comply with traditional redistricting principles, \nincluding one-person one-vote, compactness, contiguity, respect for communities of \ninterest, and the non-dilution of minority voting strength.   The illustrative plans \navoid 2018 incumbent conflicts, i.e. no incumbents are paired in the same district.14 \n52. The illustrative plans are drawn to follow, to the extent possible, county \nboundaries. Where counties are split to comply with one-person one-vote \nrequirements, I have generally used whole 2010 Census VTDs as sub-county \ncomponents.15   \n(b) Illustrative Plans – Common Characteristics \n \n53. The four illustrative plans share the following features: \n•  The 2010 Black VAP in the illustrative majority-Black districts is well \nabove 50%, resulting in BVAP to NH White VAP margins ranging from \nabout 4.7 to 8 percentage points. \n                                                 \n14 With the exception of two incumbents whose addresses were provided by Defendant, I \ndetermined incumbent residences to the best of my knowledge based on publicly available \ninformation. As of the date of this report, the Defendant in this case has not provided the \nremaining incumbent addresses in the course of discovery. \n15 In 2017, during the remedy stage of Alabama Legislative Black Caucus et al. v. Alabama \net al., the parties relied on 2010 Census VTD boundaries as precinct identifiers. \n  23 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 23 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 24 of 43\n•  The plans split the same number of counties or fewer than the 2011 Plan. \nIllustrative Plan 1 and Illustrative Plan 4 split six counties – one less than \nunder the 2011 Plan. Illustrative Plan 2 and Illustrative Plan 3 split seven \ncounties.  \n•  All four illustrative plans have fewer discrete county splits (unique \ndistrict/county combinations) than the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan has 15 \ndiscrete splits, versus 12 in Illustrative Plans 1 and 4. Illustrative Plans 2 \nand 3 have 14 discrete splits. \n•  The illustrative plans create a new majority-Black District 2 that joins \nAfrican American communities in Mobile, Montgomery and the central \nand eastern rural Black Belt counties.  \n•  New majority-Black District 2 under the illustrative plans has a \nconfiguration that is similar to District 5 in the 2011 BOE Plan.  \n•  Montgomery County is entirely within new majority-Black District 2 \nunder the illustrative plans.  The plans eliminate the three-district split of \nMontgomery County and the City of Montgomery under the 2011 Plan.  \n•  Under the illustrative plans, District 7 joins African American \ncommunities in Jefferson County, Tuscaloosa, and the western rural Black \nBelt counties, as it does in the 2011 Plan. \n•  Like the 2011 BOE Plan, the illustrative plans join District 1 in Baldwin \nCounty with District 1 in part of Mobile County.  Illustrative Plans 1, 2, \nand 3 join Baldwin to Mobile by following I-10 and U.S. 98 across \nMobile Bay and south into the City of Mobile. Illustrative Plan 4 joins \nBaldwin and Mobile counties across the northern quadrant of Mobile \nCounty, bisected by I-65.  \n•  Under all four illustrative plans, District 5 (north Alabama) is virtually \nidentical to 2011 Plan CD 5. The only difference is that 200 persons in \nJackson County assigned to CD 4 are in a single contiguous area rather \nthan two non-contiguous pieces as in the 2011 Plan. \n(c) Illustrative Plan 1  \n \n54.

The districts in the illustrative plans are reasonably shaped and \ncompact. Exhibit L-1 (Reock16) and Exhibit L-2 (Polsby- Popper17) report \ndistrict-by-district compactness scores generated by Maptitude. \n                                                 \n16 “The Reock test is an area-based measure that compares each district to a circle, which is \nconsidered to be the most compact shape possible. For each district, the Reock test computes the \nratio of the area of the district to the area of the minimum enclosing circle for the district.  The \nmeasure is always between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most compact. The Reock test computes \none number for each district and the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for the \nplan.” Maptitude For Redistricting software documentation (authored by the Caliper \nCorporation). \n17 The Polsby-Popper test computes the ratio of the district area to the area of a circle with the \nsame perimeter: 4pArea/ (Perimeter2). The measure is always between 0 and 1, with 1 being the \nmost compact. The Polsby-Popper test computes one number for each district and the minimum, \nmaximum, mean and standard deviation for the plan.

The table in Figure 19 (on the next page) summarizes the Reock and \nPolsby-Popper scores for the four illustrative plans, alongside scores for the 2011 \nPlan and other statewide plans.  \n83. On balance, compared to the 2011 Plan, the illustrative plans score \nsomewhat less compact on the Reock measure. But in all instances the Reock \nscore of the two majority-Black districts is higher than the minimum Reock \ndistrict score in the 2011 Plan (.22). And under Illustrative Plan 1, District 7 has \nthe same Reock score as CD 7 (.38) in the 2011 Plan.  \n84.  Illustrative Plans 2 and 4 have the same mean average score as the \n2011 Plan on the Polsby Popper measure, with Illustrative Plans 1 and 3 scoring \n.01 and .02 lower, respectively. In all instances the Polsby-Popper score of the two \nmajority-Black districts is the same as or higher than the minimum Polsby-Popper \ndistrict score in the 2011 Plan (.13).  \n  34 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 34 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 35 of 43\nFigure 19 \n               Compactness Scores – Illustrative Plans vs 2011 Plan \n   \nReock     Polsby-Popper \nLow  High     Low  High \n2011 Plan               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .38  .22  .49    .19  .13  .28 \nCD 7  .38        .13     \nBOE Plan               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .40  .24  .52    .19  .15  .22 \nBOE District 4  .40        .15     \nBOE District 5  .37        .15     \n2017 State Senate Plan               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .40  .14  .63    .25  .11  .57 \n2017 State House Plan               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .38  .11  .64    .23  .09  .49 \nIllustrative Plan 1               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .31  .21  .38    .18  .11  .27 \nDistrict 2  .35        .18     \nDistrict 7  .38        .20     \nIllustrative Plan 2               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .32  .21  .46    .19  .12  .27 \nDistrict 2  .27        .14     \nDistrict 7  .31        .20     \nIllustrative Plan 3               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .28  .20  .35    .17  .11  .27 \nDistrict 2  .33        .18     \nDistrict 7  .31        .13     \nIllustrative Plan 4               \nAll Districts (mean avg.)  .33  .22  .52    .19  .13  .27 \nDistrict 2  .24        .13     \nDistrict 7  .35        .26     \n \n85.

The table in Figure 20 summarizes county and 2010 VTD splits \nunder the 2011 Plan and the illustrative plans. \n Figure 20 \n            County and VTD Splits – Illustrative Plans vs 2011 Plans \n \n2010 VTD \nCounty  Discrete \n   Splits \nSplits  Spits \n(Populated) \n  \n2011 Plan  7  15    16 \nIllustrative Plan 1  6  12    12 \nIllustrative Plan 2  7  14    11 \nIllustrative Plan 3  7  14    15 \nIllustrative Plan 4  6  12    10 \n87.   The 2011 Plan contains seven county splits, compared to six in \nIllustrative Plans 1 and 4 and seven in Illustrative Plans 2 and 3. \n88.   The illustrative plans are across-the-board superior in terms of discrete \nsplits (unique district/county combinations). As shown in Figure 20, due to the \nthree-way split in Montgomery County, there are 15 discrete splits in the 2011 Plan. \nThis compares to 12 discrete splits in Illustrative Plans 1 and 4, and 14 in \nIllustrative Plans 2 and 3.  \n  36 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 36 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 37 of 43\n89.  Figure 20 also reveals that the illustrative plans split fewer 2010 VTDs \nthan the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan splits populated areas18 in 16 VTDs – \ncompared to 12 in Illustrative Plan 1, 11 in Illustrative Plan 2, 15 in Illustrative \nPlan 3, and 10 in Illustrative Plan 4. \n(c) Voter Registration \n90.   Present day voter registration statistics indicate that African Americans \nconstitute a majority of registered voters in both District 2 and District 7.19 \n91.  For example, African Americans comprise about 54% of registered \nvoters in District 7 under Illustrative Plan 4.   (See November 2018 county-level \nregistered voter statistics in Exhibit M-1.)  \n92.  Excluding Mobile County, where at this juncture I do not have access to \nprecinct-level registered voter information, African Americans comprise about 57% \nof registered voters in District 2 under Illustrative Plan 4. \n \n                                                 \n18 A populated split divides population in a VTD into two or more districts. The 2011 Plan \nand the illustrative plans also split unpopulated areas. Generally, unpopulated splits involve splits \ndue to bodies of waters or municipal boundaries \n19 This estimate is derived from county-level voter registration statistics for the 2018 General \nElection and a February 2019 Jefferson County registered voter file (obtained from the Secretary \nof State) that I geocoded using Maptitude. \n \nSource for county-level  statistics: \nhttps://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data \n  37 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 37 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 38 of 43\n(d) Census 2020 Redistricting Prospects\n93. The two majority-Black districts in the illustrative plans have staying\npower. This is the case even if Alabama loses a congressional district after the \nrelease of the 2020 Census, an issue I understand has been raised by counsel for the \nDefendant.  \n94.  The Census Bureau estimates that the statewide 2018 population is \n4,887,871. The ideal district size of a congressional district under a 6-district plan, \nbased on a population of 4.9 million (slightly higher than the 2018 estimate), is \n816,667.  \n95.  The area encompassing the majority-Black districts under the illustrative \nplans, as shown in the Figure 12 map (see ¶¶47-49 supra), has a 2010 population of \n1,707,430. This is 114,184 persons more than the population necessary to create two \ncongressional districts under a 6-district plan.  \n96.  But the preceding calculation does not adjust for population change in \nthe area since 2010. Exhibit M-2 shows 2010-2017 county-level population change. \nThe urban and university counties (highlighted in green) show strong Black \npopulation growth since 2010, while the rural Black Belt counties have experienced \npopulation declines (highlighted in red).   \n38\nExhibit 1 pg 38 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 39 of 43\n97.  To be sure, Black population loss in the rural Black Belt counties has \nbeen significant in percentage terms since 2010. The estimated 2010 to 2017 net \nBlack population loss for these ten counties is 12,510 persons (-9.51%). But the \nsignificant post-2010 urban Black population growth in the counties of Jefferson \n(+10,781), Montgomery (+7,600), Mobile (+6,675) and Tuscaloosa (+9,240) more \nthan offsets the rural Black Belt loss.  \n98.   The estimated 2010 to 2017 Black population gain for these four central \nand south Alabama counties is 34,296 persons (5.61%).  By contrast, the NH White \npopulation in these same four counties declined by an estimated 29,183 persons (-\n3.65%) between 2010 and 2017. \n99.    As shown in Figure 21 (on the next page), mid-decade estimates from \nthe 5-year 2013-2017 Special Tabulation of the ACS20 confirm that the single-race \nNH Black CVAP (“BCVAP”) in Districts 2  and 7 under the illustrative plans \nremains well above 50% – and higher than the 2010 Census BVAP percentages. \n                                                 \n20  Based on a disaggregation of block group level CVAP estimates to 2010 census block-\nlevel VAP.  \n \nBlock group data source: \n \nhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html \n \nThe midpoint of the 2013-2017 survey period is July 1, 2015. Thus, estimates reported in the 5-\nyear ACS are nearly four years behind current 2019 citizenship rates. \nThe Special Tabulation does not provide an “any part’ estimate, so the SR NH Black CVAP \nunderstates the AP Black CVAP.\n \n  39 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 39 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 40 of 43\nThe BCVAP margin over the NH White CVAP ranges from 6.59 percentage points \n(District 7 in Illustrative Plan 3) to 10.74 percentage points (District 2 in Illustrative \nPlan 2). \nFigure 21  \n             2013-2017 Citizen Voting Age Population by Plan \nNH Black \n% NH  % NH  CVAP to NH \nSR Black  White  White CVAP \n(cid:3)(cid:3) CVAP  CVAP  Margin \n2011 Plan   (cid:3)(cid:3)\n     \nDistrict 2  30.27%  65.59%  -35.32% \nDistrict 7  62.40%  35.25%  27.15% \nIllustrative Plan 1          \nDistrict 2  53.40%  42.98%  10.42% \nDistrict 7  52.70%  44.57%  8.13% \nIllustrative Plan 2          \nDistrict 2  53.54%  42.80%  10.74% \nDistrict 7  53.71%  43.53%  10.18% \nIllustrative Plan 3          \nDistrict 2  53.03%  43.45%  9.58% \nDistrict 7  52.02%  45.43%  6.59% \nIllustrative Plan 4          \nDistrict 2  52.28%  44.08%  8.20% \nDistrict 7  52.27%  45.01%  7.26% \n100.  In light of the Census Bureau’s 2017 population by race estimates and \nthe 2013-2017 ACS, it is probable that two majority-Black districts can be drawn \nin central and south Alabama based on the 2020 Census, even under a six-district \nplan.  \n \n  40 \n \nExhibit 1 pg 40 of 43\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 113-1   Filed 12/04/19   Page 41 of 43\nV.

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR  \nTHE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n \n \nLAKEISHA CHESTNUT, an individual; \nCivil Action No. 2:18-cv-907-KOB  \nMARLENE MARTIN, an individual; BOBBY \nDUBOSE, an individual; RODNEY LOVE, an \nindividual; JANICE WILLIAMS, an individual;   \nKAREN JONES, an individual; RODERICK \nCLARK, an individual; JOHN HARRIS, an \nindividual, MINNIE AUSTIN, an individual; \nJOSEPH BOYKINS, an individual, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nJOHN H. MERRILL, in his official capacity as \nAlabama Secretary of State,  \nDefendant. \n \nAMENDED COMPLAINT \n1.  Plaintiffs bring this voting rights action to challenge Alabama Act No. 2011-518 \n(“S.B. 484”), now codified at Ala. Code § 17-14-70, on the grounds that it violates Section 2 of \nthe Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301. \n2.  Under S.B. 484, the Alabama legislature carefully distributed African-American \nvoters between four congressional districts, diluting African-American voting strength and \nconfining African-American voting power to one majority-minority district.  \n3.  S.B. 484 “packs” African-American voters into the Seventh Congressional \nDistrict (“CD 7”) and “cracks” African-American voters among three other congressional \ndistricts—Congressional Districts 1, 2, and 3—despite the fact that the African-American \npopulation in these areas could have been united to form an additional majority-minority \ncongressional district in which African-American voters would have the opportunity to elect \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 2 of 32\ntheir candidates of choice. In this way, S.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \n4.  CD 7 was established as a majority-minority district in the wake of Congress’s \n1982 amendment to the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited voting practices that produced \nracially discriminatory results, regardless of whether the challenged practice had been adopted \nwith the intent to discriminate. As a result, in 1992, for the first time since Reconstruction, \nAfrican-American voters who lived in CD 7 were able to elect their candidate of choice—Earl F. \nHilliard, an African American—to Congress. Today, CD 7 is represented by Democratic \nRepresentative Terri Sewell, an African American who was first elected in 2010.  \n5.  Under Act No. 2002-57, which was enacted in 2002 and established Alabama’s \ncongressional redistricting plan following the 2000 Census, the Black Voting Age Population \n(“BVAP”) of CD 7 was 58.33%. Under S.B. 484, which was enacted in 2011 and established \nAlabama’s congressional redistricting plan following the 2010 Census, the legislature increased \nthe BVAP of CD 7 from 58.33% to 60.91%.  \n6.  The African-American population in Alabama is sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact to form a majority of eligible voters—meaning, a majority of the voting \nage population —1 in two congressional districts.  \n7.  African-American residents of Alabama, including in the Black Belt, have \n                                                 \n1 The phrases “majority of eligible voters” and “majority of the voting age population” have been \nused by courts interchangeably when discussing the threshold requirements of a vote-dilution \nclaim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See, e.g., Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 461 F.3d 1011, \n1019 (8th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he first Gingles precondition . . . requires only a simple majority of \neligible voters in a single-member district.” (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)); \nTerrebonne Parish Branch NAACP v. Jindal, 274 F. Supp. 3d 395, 428 (M.D. La. 2017) (“At the \nGingles One stage, the Supreme Court requires only a simple majority of eligible voters in the \nsingle-member district.” (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Hereinafter, the \nphrase “majority of eligible voters” when used in this Complaint shall also refer to the “majority \nof the voting age population.” \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 3 of 32\nsuffered from a long history of marginalization and discrimination, including, as alleged here, the \ndilution of African-American voting strength through redistricting. When African Americans \nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to elect a representative of their \nchoice to the U.S. House of Representatives to advocate on their behalf, the result is systemic \nneglect of their needs and concerns.  \n8.  As evidenced by an array of factors, such as the history of racial discrimination in \nvoting, the perpetuation of racial appeals in Alabama elections, and the socio-economic effects \nof decades of discrimination against African Americans that hinder their ability to participate \neffectively in the political process, Alabama’s failure to create a second majority-minority \ncongressional district in S.B. 484 has resulted in the dilution of African-American voting \nstrength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \n9.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order (i) declaring that S.B. 484 violates Section 2 \nof the Voting Rights Act; (ii) enjoining Defendant from conducting future elections under S.B. \n484; (iii) ordering a congressional redistricting plan that includes two majority-minority \ncongressional districts; and (iv) providing any such additional relief as is appropriate.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and \n1988, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), 1343(a)(4), and 1357. \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 2202.  \n12.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff LaKeisha Chestnut is an African-American citizen of the United States \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 4 of 32\nand of the State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Mobile County in CD 1. \nMs. Chestnut has resided in CD 1 since 2016. In 2016, Ms. Chestnut, who votes Democratic, was \ngiven no opportunity to elect her candidate of choice because the Republican candidate was \nunopposed. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of \nMobile County, including Ms. Chestnut’s residence, to provide a remedy for the existing Section \n2 violation. The apportionment of one majority-minority district to the sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact minority population in Alabama, as opposed to the two majority-\nminority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Ms. Chestnut’s voting power and \ndenies her the equal opportunity to vote for a candidate of her choice to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. \n14.  Plaintiff Marlene Martin is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Montgomery County in CD 7. \nMs. Martin is denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. An additional majority-minority district could \nbe drawn incorporating all or some of Montgomery County, including Ms. Martin’s residence, to \nprovide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of one majority-\nminority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. Martin’s voting power. \n15.  Plaintiff Bobby DuBose is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Jefferson County in CD 7.

Mr. \nLove has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because he is packed in CD 7, where his vote is of lesser value because African-\nAmerican voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority district to \nthe sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in Alabama, as \nopposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Mr. \nLove’s voting power. \n17.

Ms. \nWilliams has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. The apportionment of one majority-minority \ndistrict to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. William’s voting power. \n18.  Plaintiff Karen Jones is an African-American citizen of the United States and of \nthe State of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Montgomery County in CD 7. Ms. \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 6 of 32\nJones has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because she is packed in CD 7, where her vote is of lesser value because \nAfrican-American voters are concentrated there. An additional majority-minority district could \nbe drawn incorporating all or some of Montgomery County, including Ms. Jones’ residence, to \nprovide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation.  The apportionment of one majority-\nminority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Ms. Jones’s voting power. \n19.  Plaintiff Roderick Clark is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Bullock County in CD 2. Mr. \nClark has been unable to elect candidates of his choice to the U.S. House of Representatives \ndespite strong electoral support for those candidates from other African-American voters in his \ncommunity. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of \nBullock County, including Mr. Clark’s residence, to provide a remedy for the existing Section 2 \nviolation. The apportionment of one majority-minority district to the sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact minority population in Alabama, as opposed to the two majority-\nminority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Mr. Clark’s voting power and denies \nhim the equal opportunity to vote for a candidate of his choice to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. \n20.  Plaintiff John Harris is an African-American citizen of the United States and of \nthe State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Lee County in CD 3. Mr. Harris has \nbeen unable to elect candidates of his choice to the U.S. House of Representatives despite strong \nelectoral support for those candidates from other African-American voters in his community. An \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 7 of 32\nadditional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of Lee County to \nprovide a remedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of one majority-\nminority district to the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in \nAlabama, as opposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, \ndilutes Mr. Harris’s voting power and denies him the equal opportunity to vote for a candidate of \nhis choice to the U.S. House of Representatives. \n21.  Ms. Minnie Austin is an African-American citizen of the United States and of the \nState of Alabama. She is a resident and registered voter in Macon County in CD 3. Ms. Austin  \nhas been unable to elect candidates of her choice to the U.S. House of Representatives despite \nstrong electoral support for those candidates from other African-American voters in her \ncommunity. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn incorporating all or some of \nMacon County, including Ms. Austin’s residence, to provide a remedy for the existing Section 2 \nviolation.  The apportionment of one majority-minority district to the sufficiently numerous and \ngeographically compact minority population in Alabama, as opposed to the two majority-\nminority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Ms. Austin’s voting power and \ndenies her the equal opportunity to vote for a candidate of her choice to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. \n22.  Plaintiff Joseph Boykins is an African-American citizen of the United States and \nof the State of Alabama. He is a resident and registered voter in Clarke County in CD 7. Mr. \nBoykins has been denied an equal opportunity to vote for candidates for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives because he is packed in CD 7, where his vote is of lesser value because African-\nAmerican voters are concentrated there. An additional majority-minority district could be drawn \nincorporating all or some of Clarke County, including Mr. Boykins’ residence, to provide a \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 8 of 32\nremedy for the existing Section 2 violation. The apportionment of one majority-minority district \nto the sufficiently numerous and geographically compact minority population in Alabama, as \nopposed to the two majority-minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act, dilutes Mr. \nBoykins’ voting power. \n23.  Defendant John H. Merrill is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary of State \nof Alabama. The Secretary of State is the State’s chief election officer. Ala. Code § 17-1-3(a). In \nthat capacity, he is responsible for providing uniform guidance for election activities and \nimplementing election laws and regulations. See Ala. Admin. Code r. 820-2-1 - 820-2-4. \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n24.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a), prohibits any \n“standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color[.]” Thus, in addition to prohibiting \npractices that deny outright the exercise of the right to vote, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \nprohibits vote dilution. A violation of Section 2 is established if it is shown that, “the political \nprocesses leading to nomination or election” in the jurisdiction “are not equally open to \nparticipation by [minority voters] in that its members have less opportunity than other members \nof the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their \nchoice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).  \n25.  The dilution of African-American voting strength “may be caused by the dispersal \nof blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from the \nconcentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.”  Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986).  \n26.  The United States Supreme Court, in Thornburg v. Gingles, identified three \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 9 of 32\nnecessary preconditions (“the Gingles preconditions”) for a claim of vote dilution under Section \n2 of the Voting Rights Act: (1) the minority group must be “sufficiently large and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”; (2) the minority group must be \n“politically cohesive”; and (3) the majority must vote “sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . \nusually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” 478 U.S. at 50-51. \n27.  Once all three preconditions are established, the statute directs courts to consider \nwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, members of a racial group have less opportunity \nthan other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect \nrepresentatives of their choice. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). The Senate Report on the 1982 \namendments to the Voting Rights Act identifies several non-exclusive factors that courts should \nconsider when determining if, under the totality of the circumstances in a jurisdiction, the \noperation of the electoral device being challenged results in a violation of Section 2.  \n28.  These Senate factors include: (1) the history of official voting-related \ndiscrimination in the state or political subdivision; (2) the extent to which voting in the elections \nof the state or political subdivision is racially polarized; (3) the extent to which the state or \npolitical subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity \nfor discrimination against the minority group, such as unusually large election districts, majority-\nvote requirements, and prohibitions against bullet-voting; (4) the exclusion of members of the \nminority group from candidate slating processes; (5) the extent to which minority group \nmembers bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, \nwhich hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; (6) the use of overt or \nsubtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and (7) the extent to which members of the minority \ngroup have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.  \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 10 of 32\n29.  The Senate Report itself and the cases interpreting it have made clear that “there \nis no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them \npoint one way or the other.” United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1566 n.33 \n(11th Cir. 1984) (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29 (1982)); see also id. (“The statute explicitly \ncalls for a ‘totality-of-the circumstances’ approach and the Senate Report indicates that no \nparticular factor is an indispensable element of a dilution claim.”). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n30.  In June 2011, the Alabama legislature passed legislation to redraw Alabama’s \nseven congressional districts, as set forth at Ala. Code § 17-14-70. \n31.  On May 26, 2011, S.B. 484 passed in the Alabama Senate on a 19-11 vote over \nthe objection of all seven of the state’s African-American senators. On June 1, 2011, S.B. 484 \npassed the House on a 65-37 vote.  \n32.  Prior to the passage of S.B. 484, Joe Reed, who was the Alabama Democratic \nParty’s vice chairman for minority affairs at the time, asked leaders of the Alabama Legislative \nCommittee on Reapportionment to explore the possibility of creating a second majority African-\nAmerican congressional district in Alabama. Nonetheless, S.B. 484 included only the existing \nmajority-minority district and failed to create an additional district in which African Americans \nwould have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.  \n33.  Alabama Governor Bentley signed S.B. 484 into law on June 8, 2011.  \n34.  S.B. 484 was sponsored or co-sponsored by four white Republican state \nsenators—Senators Gerald Dial, Jimmy Holley, Trip Pittman, and Clay Scofield. Senator Dial \nalso helped draw the 2011 Alabama state legislative redistricting plan, which was declared \nunconstitutional because three state senate and nine state house districts were drawn as illegal \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 11 of 32\nracial gerrymanders. See Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1038 \n(M.D. Ala. 2017). The same political consultant, Randy Hinaman, drew both the state legislative \nand congressional districts following the 2010 Census. Id.  \n35.  CD 7 is the only majority-minority district in S.B. 484. It is heavily black and \npacks in almost one-third of Alabama’s African-American population. CD 7 has been \nrepresented by an African American since 1992. It is currently represented by Representative \nTerri Sewell, who was first elected in 2010.  \n36.  CD 7 includes Choctaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Marengo, Pickens, \nPerry, Sumter, and Wilcox counties, as well as portions of Clarke, Jefferson, Montgomery, and \nTuscaloosa counties.  \n37.  The prior version of CD 7 had a BVAP of 58.33%. Before Representative Sewell \ntook office, Artur Davis, an African-American Democrat, held the office from 2002 until 2010. \nIn each of his general elections, Davis either won handily or ran unopposed.   \n38.  In the 2011 redistricting process, the Alabama legislature increased the district’s \nBVAP to 60.91% despite CD 7’s strong history of African-American representation since its \nestablishment as a majority-minority district. \n39.  S.B. 484 moved African Americans from majority-white districts into CD 7, \nheavily concentrating African Americans in the district and diluting their influence in adjacent \ndistricts.   \n40.  Representative Sewell ran in 2010 and won in a landslide election with \napproximately 72% of the vote. After the enactment of S.B. 484, Representative Sewell won re-\nelection in 2012 with approximately 75% of the vote. In both the 2014 and 2016 general \nelections she ran unopposed. \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 12 of 32\n41.  S.B. 484 “packs” African-American voters into CD 7 and “cracks” African-\nAmerican population centers among other districts, preventing the emergence of a second \ncongressional district in which minorities would have an opportunity to elect their candidates of \nchoice.  \n42.  By unpacking CD 7’s African-American population and combining it with \nAfrican-American populations in other districts such as CDs 1, 2, and 3, the Alabama legislature \ncould have drawn two majority-minority districts in S.B. 484, as required by Section 2 of the \nVoting Rights Act.  \n43.  Each of the three districts among which the African-American population is \nsignificantly cracked—CDs 1, 2, and 3—includes at least one heavily African-American area in \nan otherwise majority-white district. For example, CD 3 contains Macon County, which is home \nto the historically African-American college Tuskegee University and has an African-American \npopulation of 82.6%. Similarly, CD 1 includes Mobile County, which has an African-American \npopulation of 34.6%, and Monroe County, which has an African-American population of 41.7%. \nMontgomery County, which has an African-American population of 54.7%, is split between CDs \n2, 3, and 7. The African-American population in the eastern portion of Alabama is split neatly in \ntwo by the border between CDs 2 and 3. \n44.  The Black Belt is located in the south-central region of Alabama. The region was \noriginally named for its black soil, but over time the term has also been used to refer to counties \nwith a large black population. A large African-American population resides in the Black Belt and \nits surrounding area because of the history of agriculture and slavery in that region. Booker T. \nWashington said in 1901 that the Black Belt was “the part of the South where the slaves were \nmost profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers.” According to \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 13 of 32\nthe Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama, the “traditional \ncounties” of the Alabama Black Belt include: Sumter, Choctaw, Greene, Hale, Marengo, Perry, \nDallas, Wilcox, Lowndes, Butler, Crenshaw, Montgomery, Macon, Bullock, Pike, Barbour, and \nRussell. The traditional Black Belt is surrounded by counties that also have substantial African-\nAmerican populations, including but not limited to, Washington, Mobile, Clarke, Escambia, and \nMonroe counties.  \n45.  In S.B. 484, the Black Belt and the surrounding area is split among four \ncongressional districts—CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7.  \nRacial Polarization \n46.  African-American voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and overwhelmingly \nsupport Democratic candidates.  \n47.  The white majority, which overwhelmingly supports Republican candidates, votes \nas a bloc usually to defeat African-American voters’ candidates of choice.  \n48.  For example, according to CNN exit polling in the 2017 special election for the \nU.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, 96% of African-American voters \nsupported Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Senator Jones won 15 of the 17 counties that \ncomprise the “traditional counties” of the Black Belt listed in Paragraph 42 herein. When the \nelection is viewed through the lens of the state’s seven congressional districts, Senator Jones won \nonly one—CD 7. \n49.  In the 2016 presidential election, over 80% of African-American voters voted for \nthe Democratic candidate, while fewer than 20% of white voters statewide (and fewer than 15% \nof white voters in the Black Belt) voted for the Democratic candidate. African-American voters’ \ncandidate of choice lost the statewide vote by a margin of 27.7 percentage points.   \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 14 of 32\n50.  The last time voters in CD 1 elected an African American to represent them in \nCongress was during Reconstruction. While more than a quarter of the voting age population in \nCD 1 is African-American, white Republicans have been continuously elected to represent CD 1 \nsince 1965.  \n51.  African-American Democrat Burton LeFlore has sought election to the U.S. \nHouse to represent CD 1 twice. Both times LeFlore, the African-American voters’ candidate of \nchoice, was defeated by Bradley Byrne, a white Republican, in wide margins that reflect the \nstrongly racially polarized voting in the state. First, in a special election in 2013, despite strong \nAfrican-American support for LeFlore, Byrne won in a landslide victory, receiving \napproximately two-thirds of the vote. A publicly reported precinct-by-precinct analysis of the \nvote in Mobile and Baldwin counties showed that Byrne was the overwhelming favorite \neverywhere—except in areas of CD 1 with large concentrations of African Americans. In the \n2014 general election, LeFlore was again soundly defeated.  \n52.  Without exception, federal courts have found that voting in Alabama is and \nremains severely racially polarized. In 1983, in Buskey v. Oliver, the U.S. District Court for the \nMiddle District of Alabama found that the City of Montgomery, which is the county seat of \nMontgomery County and is located in the Black Belt, is “a city still polarized by race, with only \nwhite council members being elected from predominantly white council districts and with only \nblack council members being elected from predominantly black council districts.” Buskey v. \nOliver, 565 F. Supp. 1473, 1482 (M.D. Ala. 1983).     \n53.  In United States v. Dallas County Commission, 739 F.2d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir. \n1984), the Eleventh Circuit found that racially polarized voting existed in Dallas County \nelections for the period 1966 through 1978. On remand, the U.S. District Court for the Southern \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 15 of 32\nDistrict of Alabama found that based on evidence from election contests between 1978 and 1986, \nvoting patterns in Dallas County remained polarized along racial lines to a sufficient degree to \nwarrant the conclusion that, when combined with the use of a majority vote requirement in the \nprimary and the use of numbered posts, the at-large system for electing county commissioners in \nDallas County violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. United States v. Dallas Cty. Comm’n, \n636 F. Supp. 704, 710 (S.D. Ala.), rev’d on other grounds, 791 F.2d 831 (1986).   \n54.  In 2002, in Dillard v. Baldwin County Commission, the court found that, “[t]he \nplaintiffs have shown that black citizens of Baldwin County still suffer from the racially \npolarized voting and from historically depressed conditions, economically and socially.” Dillard \nv. Baldwin County Comm’n, 222 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002), aff’d, 376 F.3d 1260 \n(11th Cir. 2004).  \n55.  Federal courts in Alabama have acknowledged the causal connection between \nracial bloc voting and the history of de jure segregation: “Racial bloc voting by whites is \nattributable in part to past discrimination, and the past history of segregation and discrimination \naffects the choices of voters at the polls.” Brown v. Bd. of School Comm’rs of Mobile Cty., 542 F. \nSupp. 1078, 1094 (S.D. Ala. 1982), aff’d, 706 F.2d 1103 (11th Cir. 1983), aff’d 464 U.S. 1005 \n(1983). \nHistory of Official Voting-Related Discrimination \n56.  In addition to the three Gingles preconditions noted above, the totality of the \ncircumstances in this case supports Plaintiffs’ claim that African-American voters in Alabama \nhave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process \nand elect representatives of their choice to Congress, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act.  \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 16 of 32\n57.  Few, if any, states rival Alabama’s notorious history of state-sponsored racial \ndiscrimination against African Americans, particularly in the voting context. Historically, and \ncontinuing through today, Alabama has implemented voting practices that have hindered African \nAmericans’ ability to participate equally in the political process. \n58.  The history goes as far back as the post-Civil War era. Despite the passage of the \nReconstruction Amendments after the Civil War and the fact that African-American men were \ngiven the franchise under the Alabama Constitution of 1867—which allowed every male person \n21 years of age or older who satisfied the citizenship and residence requirements to vote—the \nAlabama legislature moved swiftly to undo these gains.  \n59.  The Alabama legislature adopted a new state constitution in 1875 and \nsubsequently passed a series of local laws eliminating elections for county commissioners, \ninstead giving the governor the power to appoint the commissioners. These laws were designed \nto prevent the election of African-American county commissioners.  \n60.  During Reconstruction, black voters were frequently violently intimidated and \neven killed by white paramilitary groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and a notorious group \ncalled the “White League.” In the lead-up to the 1870 gubernatorial election, for example, in \nGreene County, Ku Klux Klansmen verbally harassed and violently attacked black voters at a \npolitical rally at the county courthouse where approximately 2,000 African-American \nRepublican voters were gathered. The Klan’s violent tactics had their intended result: black \nvoters stayed away from the polls in fear of more violence, and the results of the 1870 election \nreflected the absence of black Republican voting power. In the 1868 presidential election, \nGreene County voted for Republican Ulysses S. Grant by a margin of 2,000 votes; by contrast in \nthe 1870 gubernatorial election, Greene County supported Democrat Robert B. Lindsay by a \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 17 of 32\nmargin of 43.  \n61.  On election day, November 3, 1874, an Alabama chapter of the White League \nformed a mob, invaded Barbour County and killed seven African-American Republican voters \nand injured at least 70 more. The White League subsequently refused to count any Republican \nvotes cast in the election, declared the Democrats victorious, and seized every county office in \nBarbour County.  \n62.  In 1901, Alabama held a Constitutional Convention, the purpose of which was to \nenshrine in the state constitution the disenfranchisement of African Americans. The President of \nthe Constitutional Convention, John B. Knox, stated in his inaugural address that the intention of \nthe convention was “to establish white supremacy in this State.” The Convention ratified changes \nto the constitution that required voters to pass literacy tests as a prerequisite to registering to \nvote. A grandfather clause exempted anyone who had served in the military or descended from \nveterans. The intent and effect of the grandfather clause was to ensure that illiterate white \nresidents could still register to vote, as African Americans had been precluded from serving in \nthe military.  \n63.  The ratified Constitution also required voters to pay a cumulative poll tax of $1.50 \nevery year. Though color blind on its face, the poll tax was intended to and had the effect of \ndisenfranchising African Americans. At the 1901 Constitutional Convention, Delegate Hood \nvoiced his approval of the poll tax because of the detrimental effect it would have on African \nAmericans: “Now in my judgment, this poll tax qualification is the most important provision in \nthis entire article. We are told that in the Black Belt and that in many counties in the state, there \nis a large percentage of those young Negroes who are coming of age that will be able to read and \nwrite, therefore will be qualified under the provisions of this article. The only safety valve, Mr. \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 18 of 32\nPresident, that is contained in this article after 1903 for a large proportion of the Negroes in this \nState is this Poll tax of $1.50.” United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. 95, 99 (M.D. Ala. 1966).   \n64.  After the passage of the 1901 constitution, segregation progressed rapidly, as \npublic spaces were increasingly either separated or reserved for whites alone. By 1913, a black \nsociologist concluded that African Americans in Mobile lived in an isolated world, utterly \nseparate from whites in most aspects of life and even death, with blacks and whites being buried \nin separate cemeteries.  \n65.  Because of low education rates, African Americans were forced to use their \nbodies to generate income by providing unskilled physical labor. Particularly in the Black Belt, \nAfrican Americans became sharecroppers and tenant farmers in large numbers. The economic \npicture for African Americans was bleak. By the end of the 20th century, Black Belt counties \ncontained more than 50 percent rates of child poverty, double-digit unemployment numbers, and \nmedian incomes half to three-fourths of the national average. These facts made the Black Belt, \nwhich was seen as some of America’s richest land, its poorest.  \n66.  Like other southern states, Alabama passed Jim Crow laws that legalized \nsegregation and ensured that African Americans would be treated as second-class citizens. For \nexample, in 1942, the Alabama legislature passed a resolution commending its U.S. Senators for \n“their magnificent fight against the measure now pending in Congress which is calculated to \ndestroy our Poll Tax Law,” fearing that the United States Senate would soon pass anti-poll tax \nlegislation. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. at 102. Alabama’s poll tax remained in effect until it was \ndeclared unconstitutional by a federal district court in 1966. See id. at 104. \n67.  In 1957, the Alabama legislature transformed the boundaries of the city of \nTuskegee to a twenty-eight-sided figure designed to fence out African Americans from the city \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 19 of 32\nlimits so that only whites could elect city officials, an action the U.S. Supreme Court found \nunconstitutional in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960).  \n68.  After the Supreme Court banned the use of white primaries in Smith v. Allwright, \n321 U.S. 649 (1944), Alabama legislators were openly and unabashedly intent on finding new \nstrategies to keep African Americans out of the electoral process. In the 1950s, the legislature \npassed a bill outlawing single-shot voting in municipal elections conducted at-large. Single-shot \nvoting generally “enables a minority group to win some at-large seats if it concentrates its vote \nbehind a limited number of candidates and if the vote of the majority is divided among a number \nof candidates.” City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 184 n.19 (1980) (citation omitted), \nabrogated by Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). A law banning single-shot voting \ngenerally requires that each elector cast votes for as many candidates as there are positions. Such \na law disadvantages minority voters “because it may force them to vote for nonminority \ncandidates, thus depreciating the relative position of minority candidates.” Nevett v. Sides, 571 \nF.2d 209, 217 n.10 (5th Cir. 1978).  \n69.  The laws banning single-shot voting were repealed in 1961 and replaced with \nlaws requiring candidates to run for numbered places in all state, county, and municipal at-large \nelections. Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1357 (1986). The numbered place laws \nhad the same dilutive effect on African-American voting strength in at-large elections as the laws \nbanning single-shot voting.  \n70.  The gravity of Alabama’s discrimination and brutality against African-American \nvoters was on display in places like Selma, where in 1964 and 1965, Dallas County Sheriff Jim \nClark infamously—and violently—resisted African-American voter registration efforts and \npeaceful protests to gain access to the franchise. \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 20 of 32\n71.  In March 1965, police officers assaulted unarmed marchers crossing the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, where less than 5% of African Americans were registered to vote. The \nevent, televised across American television screens, became known as “Bloody Sunday.” The \npublicity the march received helped pave the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act in \nAugust 1965.  \n72.  Alabama was declared a “covered” state under Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights \nAct based on the state’s enforcement of unconstitutional devices or tests, including voucher \nrequirements, together with low minority voter registration and turnout rates. See South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 312-13 (1966), abrogated by Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. \n529 (2013). As a covered jurisdiction, Alabama was required to have any changes to its election \npractices or procedures “precleared” by either the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal court.  \n73.  Between 1965 and 2013, when the Supreme Court effectively barred enforcement \nof the Section 5 preclearance requirement in Shelby County v. Holder, the federal government’s \nindependent oversight helped protect Alabama’s African-American voters against \ndisenfranchisement and arbitrary and disparate treatment by the state in its election practices and \nprocedures. While Section 5 was in effect, at least 100 voting changes proposed by the State of \nAlabama were blocked or altered pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. See U.S. Dep’t \nof Justice, Civil Rights Division, Voting Section, Voting Determination Letters for Alabama, \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crt/records/vot/obj_letters/state_letters.php?state=al (last updated Aug. 7, \n2015) (listing all objections imposed against Alabama under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act).   \n74.  In 2006, during the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress was \nprovided with extensive evidence documenting the Alabama legislature’s and other state actors’ \nsustained record of unconstitutional and illegal voting discrimination practices. See, e.g., \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 21 of 32\nRenewing the Temporary Provisions of the Voting Rights Act: Legislative Options after LULAC \nv. Perry: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights \nof the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 365-402 (July 13, 2006). \n75.  Alabama’s history of voter discrimination is far from ancient. The state continues \nto implement a series of voting practices that have hindered the ability of African Americans to \nparticipate equally in the political process.  \n76.  Within the last five decades, African-American plaintiffs, the civil rights \ncommunity, and the federal government have sued Alabama on numerous occasions for racially \ndiscriminatory voting practices. See, e.g., Greater Birmingham Ministries et al. v. Alabama et \nal., 161 F. Supp. 3d 1104 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (photo identification law); Ala. Legislative Black \nCaucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015) (racial gerrymandering); S. Christian Leadership \nConference of Alabama v. Sessions, 56 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 1995) (at-large system for electing \ntrial judges); City of Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U.S. 462 (1987) (selective \nannexations); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985) (felon disenfranchisement); Harris v. \nGraddick (Harris I), 593 F. Supp. 128 (M.D. Ala. 1984) (appointment of disproportionately few \nblack poll officials); United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. 95 (M.D. Ala. 1966) \n(discriminatory administration of the poll tax); United States v. Logue, 344 F.2d 290 (5th Cir. \n1965) (racial discrimination in voter registration); Sims v. Baggett, 247 F. Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. \n1965) (racial gerrymandering); United States v. Atkins, 323 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1963) (racial \ndiscrimination in voter registration).  \n77.  The Department of Justice has sent observers to Alabama more than 91 times to \nensure that the right of African-American voters to participate in various elections was not \ndenied in the face of repeated attempts by white election officials to restrict African-American \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 22 of 32\naccess to the franchise. For instance, in 1992, the federal government sent observers to \nGreensboro, Alabama in Hale County after white election officials attempted to prevent African-\nAmerican voters from entering polling places following the election of the first African-\nAmerican officials to local office.  \n78.  In January 2014, a federal court in the Southern District of Alabama “bailed-in” \nthe City of Evergreen in Conecuh County for preclearance under Section 3(c) of the Voting \nRights Act—effectively making the county subject to preclearance under the Voting Rights Act \neven after the Shelby County v. Holder decision—because voter registrars and election officials \ncontinued to unconstitutionally discriminate against African-American voters. Allen v. City of \nEvergreen, Alabama, No. 13-0107-CG-M, 2014 WL 12607819 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 13, 2014). \n79.  In Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015), the \nSupreme Court remanded to the district court a case brought by African-American residents \nalleging that the Alabama legislative redistricting plans included racially gerrymandered districts \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. On remand, the three-\njudge panel ruled that twelve Alabama legislative districts were unconstitutional racial \ngerrymanders. Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1038 (M.D. \nAla. 2017). \n80.  Elected officials in Alabama continue to undermine voting opportunities in \nminority communities by enacting voter ID laws and resisting early voting and easier \nregistration. The day after the Shelby County decision, Alabama announced that it would move \nforward with the implementation of a strict photo ID law that had been passed by the Alabama \nlegislature in 2011. In other words, Alabama waited until it was no longer subject to preclearance \nreview under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to implement the law.  \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 23 of 32\n81.  Subsequently, the state closed 31 driver’s license offices, making it more difficult \nfor individuals to obtain the identification necessary to vote. The offices that were closed were \ndisproportionately located in poor, predominantly African-American communities. A federal \ninvestigation by the Department of Transportation found that “African Americans residing in the \nBlack Belt region of Alabama were disproportionately underserved by [the state’s] driver \nlicensing services, causing a disparate and adverse impact on the basis of race.” As a result, \nAlabama reopened many of the driver’s license offices but for fewer hours.  \n82.  In late 2015, a group of plaintiffs challenged the photo ID law on the grounds that \nit was enacted with a discriminatory purpose and would have a discriminatory effect in violation \nof Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. \nSpecifically, plaintiffs alleged that the Alabama legislature passed the photo ID law to make it \nmore burdensome for African Americans and other minorities to vote, and that the law would \nhave this intended effect because minorities disproportionately lacked the ID necessary to vote \nand lacked the necessary means (for example, transportation and time off from work) to obtain \nthe required ID. See Greater Birmingham Ministries, 161 F. Supp. 3d 1104. On February 17, \n2016, the district court denied Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. Id. The court later \ngranted motions to dismiss as to certain Defendants, and granted summary judgment for the \nSecretary of State on January 10, 2018. Greater Birmingham Ministries, 284 F.Supp.3d 1253. \nThe case is currently on appeal. \n83.  Alabama law disenfranchises individuals with certain felony convictions for \n“crimes of moral turpitude.” The list of convictions “involving moral turpitude” includes a \nnumber of non-violent crimes, including almost all theft crimes. Citizens with these \n“disqualifying” convictions may petition to have their rights restored, but only after paying all \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 24 of 32\ncourt-ordered fines, fees, and restitution. Describing this restriction as a modern-day poll tax, \nAlabama ex-felons have sued the state seeking removal of this economic barrier that limits their \nability to exercise their constitutional rights. See Thompson, et al. v. Alabama, 293 F.Supp.3d \n1313 (M.D. Ala. 2017). This law disenfranchises over 286,000 people in the state—7.6% of the \nentire statewide voting-age population, and 15.1% of the African-American male voting-age \npopulation. \n84.  Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill opposes automatic voter registration—a \nreform civil rights leaders have advocated for years—arguing that such a policy would “cheapen \nthe work” of voting rights activists, including John Lewis. In an interview, Merrill stated: “If \nyou’re too sorry or lazy to get up off of your rear to go register to vote, or to register \nelectronically, and then to go vote, then you don’t deserve that privilege. As long as I’m \nsecretary of state of Alabama, you’re going to have to show some initiative to become a \nregistered voter in this state.” \n85.  What is briefly described here as Alabama’s history and current reality of race \ndiscrimination in voting has been thoroughly documented by historians and scholars. The history \nis so extensive and well-established that several courts have taken judicial notice of it. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1346 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (“The intersection of \npolitical strategy and purposeful racial prejudice is nothing new. Alabama has a lengthy and \ninfamous history of racial discrimination in voting.”); Hunter, 471 U.S. at 229 (“[T]he Alabama \nConstitutional Convention of 1901 was part of a movement that swept the post-Reconstruction \nSouth to disenfranchise blacks . . . . The delegates to the all-white convention were not secretive \nabout their purpose.”); Dillard v. Crenshaw County, 640 F. Supp. at 1360 (“As the late Judge \nRichard T. Rives states, ‘from the Constitutional Convention of 1901 to the present, the State of \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 25 of 32\nAlabama has consistently devoted its official resources to maintaining white supremacy and a \nsegregated society.’”) (quoting United States v. Alabama, 252 F. Supp. at 101).  \nUse of Racial Appeals in Political Campaigns \n86.  In addition to Alabama’s history of discrimination against minorities in voting \nand elections, political campaigns in Alabama have often relied on both explicit and implicit \nracial appeals.  \n87.  Former Alabama Governor George Wallace was explicit in his appeal to white \nvoters, running on a platform of “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” \n88.  More recently, the 2010 elections were marked by explicit and implicit racial \nappeals. For example, certain Alabama state senators were recorded on tape deliberately \nstrategizing about suppressing African-American voter turnout by keeping an issue important to \nAfrican Americans—whether to legalize electronic bingo—off the ballot. In these conversations, \nthen-State Senator Scott Beason, then-State Representative Benjamin Lewis (now an appointed \ncounty judge), and other influential members of the Alabama legislature are heard targeting \nAfrican-American voters for “mockery and racist abuse.”  McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1346. \nThey referred to African Americans as “Aborigines” and “Indians” and predicted that if the \nballot measure appeared on the ballot “every black in this state will be bused to the polls . . . \n[e]very black, every illiterate would be bused on HUD financed buses.” Id. at 1345 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  A federal district court found that the state senators’ efforts to \ndepress African-American voter turnout constituted an intentionally discriminatory “scheme” to \n“maintain and strengthen white control of the political system,” and that “political exclusion \nthrough racism remains a real and enduring problem in this State.” Id. at 1347.  \n89.  In November 2015 at a rally for then-candidate Donald Trump in Birmingham, a \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 26 of 32\npeaceful Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked by a group of men yelling, “Go \nhome nigger.” The next day, then-candidate Trump stated, “Maybe he should have been roughed \nup, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.”  The protestor had interrupted \nTrump’s speech to shout “Black Lives Matter!” \n90.  Roy Moore, candidate for U.S. Senate in the 2017 special election, stated at a \nrevival in Jackson, Alabama, “They started [to] create new rights in 1965, and today we’ve got a \nproblem,” an apparent reference to the Voting Rights Act. When asked to speak about the last \ntime America was great, Moore stated, “I think it was great at the time when families were \nunited—even though we had slavery—they cared for one another. . . . Our families were strong, \nour country had a direction.” \nOngoing Effects of Alabama’s History of Discrimination \n91.  African-American residents of Alabama bear the effects of the state’s history of \ndiscrimination in areas such as education, employment, income, and access to health care. In \nnearly every measure of every sphere of life, African Americans in Alabama lag behind whites. \nThese socio-economic disadvantages hinder African Americans’ ability to participate effectively \nin the political process. The effects of the history of de facto and de jure segregation in all realms \nof life—from transportation, to education, criminal justice, and business ownership—are still \nclearly visible in Alabama and continue to impact African Americans’ access to the franchise. As \nlate as the 1960s, Jim Crow was a grim reality in Alabama, as many African Americans attended \nseparate and unequal schools, lived in dilapidated and deteriorating housing, and toiled as \nunderpaid domestic and farm workers who were still completely shut out of the political process.  \n92.  In the present day, the disparities resulting from this state-sponsored \ndiscrimination remains. As of 2014, 43 school districts in Alabama were under some form of \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 27 of 32\nfederal oversight as a result of continued segregation, although the Supreme Court’s landmark \nBrown v. Board of Education decision was issued 60 years earlier. \n93.  African-American children still attend schools in racially segregated \nneighborhoods, and their families still disproportionately live in poverty. According to the 2012-\n2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, 30.1% of African Americans live \nbelow the poverty line, more than double the rate for white Alabamans. Similarly, 26.1% of \nAfrican-American family households live below the poverty line, more than double the rate for \nwhite family households.  \n94.  Despite African Americans’ ties to land and the agricultural industry in Alabama, \nthey still lag behind economically, in large part because they have had limited access to land \nownership historically. Following slavery, blacks worked as sharecroppers and labored under a \nhighly exploitative system of tenant farming that preserved much of the power relations of \nslavery. This history is reflected in the economic status of African Americans as compared to \nwhites in Alabama today. \n95.   According to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, \nthe median household income for white households is $51,684; the figure for African-American \nhouseholds is $30,180.  \n96.  African Americans in Alabama are unemployed at significantly higher rates than \nwhites. The 2012-2016 American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates report that 7.5% of \nAfrican Americans over age 16 are unemployed as compared to only 3.7% of whites over age 16.  \n97.  African Americans are significantly more likely to rent their home and to not have \na vehicle available in their household as compared to whites.  \n98.  In 2010, the Alabama Department of Public Health reported that the infant \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 28 of 32\nmortality rate for African Americans was 14.1%, nearly double the rate for white Alabamans. \n99.  According to Alabama’s Prison Policy Initiative, under 2010 Census numbers, \nAfrican Americans represent only 26% of the total population but 54% of the total incarcerated \npopulation.  \nExtent to Which African Americans Have Been Elected to Public Office \n100.  African Americans are still woefully underrepresented in Alabama politics. \nDespite the fact that approximately 27% of Alabama’s population is African American, none of \nthe current statewide elected officials is African American. There has never been an African-\nAmerican governor or senator. White majorities and severe racial bloc voting continue to cement \nthese ongoing disparities.  \n101.  Because of white bloc voting against African-American candidates, only two \nAfrican Americans have been elected to statewide office in the history of Alabama. Every other \nblack statewide candidate has been defeated by a white candidate. The late Oscar Adams was \nappointed to a place on the Alabama Supreme Court in 1980; he won re-election in 1982 and \n1988. When Justice Adams retired in 1993, the governor appointed another African American, \nRalph Cook, to replace him. Justice Cook was re-elected in 1994.  \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nS.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \n102.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs of this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n103.  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the enforcement of any voting \nqualification or prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure that results in the \ndenial or abridgement of the right of any U.S. citizen to vote on account of race, color, or \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 29 of 32\nmembership in a language minority group. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a).  \n104.  The current district boundaries of CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 combine to “crack” and \n“pack” African Americans, resulting in the dilution of the electoral strength of the state’s \nAfrican-American residents, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \n105.  African Americans in Alabama are sufficiently numerous and geographically \ncompact to constitute a majority of eligible voters in two congressional districts. \n106.  Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the Alabama legislature was required \nto create a second majority-minority district in which African Americans have the opportunity to \nelect their candidates of choice.  \n107.  African-American voters in Alabama are politically cohesive, and elections in the \nstate reveal a clear pattern of racially polarized voting that allows the bloc of white voters usually \nto defeat the African Americans’ preferred candidates.  \n108.  The totality of the circumstances establishes that the current congressional map \nhas the effect of denying African-American voters an equal opportunity to participate in the \npolitical process and to elect candidates of their choice, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10301.  \n109.  By engaging in the acts and omissions alleged herein, Defendant has acted and \ncontinues to act to deny Plaintiffs rights guaranteed to them by Section 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct. Defendant will continue to violate those rights absent relief granted by this Court.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court:  \nA.  Declare that S.B. 484 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  \nB.  Order the adoption of a valid congressional redistricting plan that includes a \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 30 of 32\nsecond majority-minority district in Alabama.  \nC.  Issue a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, as well as his agents and \nsuccessors in office, from enforcing or giving any effect to the boundaries of the congressional \ndistricts as drawn in S.B. 484, including an injunction barring Defendant from conducting any \nfurther congressional elections under the current map.  \nD.  Hold hearings, consider briefing and evidence, and otherwise take actions \nnecessary to order a valid plan for new congressional districts in Alabama that comports with \nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \nE.  Grant such other or further relief the Court deems appropriate, including but not \nlimited to an award of Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs.  \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 14   Filed 07/23/18   Page 31 of 32\nDated:  July 23, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nBy /s/ Aria Branch       \nMarc Erik Elias (admitted pro hac vice) \nBruce V.

Introduction \nThe Supreme Court could not have been clearer: “Legitimate yet differing \ncommunities of interest should not be disregarded in the interest of race.” League of \nUnited Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 434 (2006) (“LULAC”).  \nAnd it told us why: “The recognition of nonracial communities of interest \nreflects the principle that a State may not assum[e] from a group of voters' race that \nthey  think  alike,  share  the  same  political  interests,  and  will  prefer  the  same \ncandidates at the polls.” Id. at 433. \nDefendant proved that the Alabama Legislature honored the requirement to \nrespect communities of interest when drawing Congressional districts in 2011. The \npresent First and Second Districts include people and communities bound together \nby real social, economic, and cultural interests. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue \nthat  the  Legislature  should  have  ignored  communities  of  interest  and  focused \nexclusively on race.  \nOf  course,  Plaintiffs  couch  their  arguments  in  terms  of  communities  of \ninterest, arguing that both the City of Mobile and Montgomery are urban areas, and \nthat western Mobile County and distant Houston County are both rural. That’s the \nbest they can do, but they might as well claim that voters in Opp and distant Muscle \nShoals are part of the same community of interest because they are all human. The \n1 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 6 of 32\nevidence showed that Plaintiffs’ districts are not based on communities of interest at \nall, but solely on race. Their districts are non-compact racial gerrymanders that fail \nto show that the African-American population is sufficiently compact to form a \nmajority in two Congressional districts. Having failed to meet their Gingles burden, \nPlaintiffs’ Section 2 claim fails.  \nBefore we even get to the merits, though, the Court must satisfy itself of its \njurisdiction. There is none, because this case is moot. Plaintiffs seek a judgment \ndeclaring that Alabama should have drawn two majority-minority Congressional \ndistricts in 2011 based on 2011 conditions, but it is undisputed that those conditions \nwill not exist after the 2020 Census when it will become clear how Alabama’s \npopulation has shifted. See doc. 95 ¶ 51. Alabama’s districting obligations after the \nnext census will depend upon the results of the census, not upon an advisory opinion \nof what Alabama should have done under conditions that no longer exist. \nThe  case  should  therefore  be  resolved  for  the  Defendant  on  grounds  of \nmootness. In the event the Court disagrees, it should hold that Plaintiffs failed to \nsatisfy  the  Gingles  prerequisites  because  their  illustrative  plans  fail  to  respect \ncommunities of interest, are unlawful racial gerrymanders, and would not have been \nprecleared. \nII. This case is moot \n“Federal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the \n2 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 7 of 32\nrights of litigants in the case before them. … A previously justiciable case is moot \nwhen the requested relief, if granted, would no longer have a practical effect on the \nrights or obligations of the litigants.” Flanigan’s Enters., Inc. v. City of Sandy \nSprings,  868  F.3d  1248,  1264  (11th  Cir.  2017)  (internal  citations,  marks,  and \nfootnotes omitted). A declaration by the Court that Alabama’s 2011 congressional \ndistricts violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act would not have a practical effect \non the rights or obligations of the litigants. It would not grant Plaintiffs a right to \nhave new districts drawn now, nor would it obligate the State to redistrict or to draw \nnew districts in a particular manner in 2021, and Plaintiffs do not say otherwise. \nThat is the end of the matter. A judgment that has no effect on the rights of \nthe parties would be advisory and thus beyond the Court’s jurisdiction. Penn Tank \nLines, Inc. v. Jackson, 2018 WL 465977, *3 (N.D. Ala. January 18, 2018) (“In short, \nas the Supreme Court explained, this court cannot address a hypothetical situation: \n[A] federal court has neither the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide \nquestions that  cannot  affect the rights  of  litigants in the  case  before them.  Its \njudgments must resolve a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief \nthrough a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising \nwhat the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” (citing Preiser v. Newkirk, \n422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975)) (internal marks omitted).). \nIn their mootness brief, doc. 112, Plaintiffs talk a lot about the Congressional \n3 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 8 of 32\ndistricts that will be drawn in 2021. Drawing those new districts would not be in any \nway controlled by a declaration that the 2011 districts violated the Voting Rights \nAct. Legislators will be drawing new districts in 2021 based on new Census data, the \nnumber of Congressional districts apportioned to Alabama as a result of the 2020 \nCensus, and an obligation to comply with Section 2 that is independent of any \ndeclaration by the Court, as Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge. See doc. 112 at 3 \n(“After all, the State’s redistricting guidelines have consistently required that any \ncongressional plan  adhere  to  the  Voting  Rights  Act.”).  And  drawing the  2021 \nCongressional districts in compliance with Section 2 would in no way remedy the \nvote dilution allegedly suffered by Plaintiffs at the hands of the 2011 Congressional \ndistricts.  \nMoreover, assuming for the sake of argument that the Court were to declare \nthat the 2011 districts violate Section 2, what would that actually mean to Legislators \nwhen they draw new districts in 2021? Plaintiffs argue that “if the Court declares \nthat Alabama’s current congressional map dilutes African American voting strength \nin central and southern Alabama in violation of the Voting Rights Act, the State will \nremedy  that  dilution  when  it draws the congressional  map  following the 2020 \nCensus.” Doc. 112 at 3.1 Do Plaintiffs contend that the State must draw two majority-\n1 Plaintiffs also try to create an argument out of the State’s interest in preserving the cores \nof existing districts. Doc. 112, p. 5-6. This is a red herring. The State’s interest in applying \n4 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 9 of 32\nblack congressional districts, even though no one knows what data would drive the \nshapes of new congressional districts? How would Legislators, given new data and \npossibly a different number of districts, know how to apply such a declaration? \nAsking these questions both underscores the absurdity of Plaintiffs’ argument and \nthe conclusion that it is moot. \nPlaintiffs suggest that a declaratory judgment about past districts will aid the \nparties’ understanding of their Section 2 obligations, doc. 112 at 3, but that is true \nonly in an advisory sense. Any statements in a declaratory judgment about Section \n2’s requirements as applied to the 2011 districts would have to be applied to wholly \nnew facts after the 2020 census. A declaratory judgment about the 2011 districts will \nbe  no  more  helpful  after  the  new  census  than  a  declaratory  judgment  about \nAlabama’s 1990 districts. In fact, it would be no more helpful than a declaratory \njudgment about Kentucky’s congressional districts. \nThis case is therefore moot, and as a consequence, the Court lacks jurisdiction \nand should enter judgment for the Defendant. \nIII. Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the Gingles prerequisites \nTo establish their Section 2 claim, Plaintiffs must first show that they meet \nthe three “Gingles prerequisites”: (1) the minority group must be sufficiently large \ntraditional districting criteria always must yield to its duty to comply with the federal Constitution \nand the Voting Rights Act.  \n5 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 10 of 32\nand geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) \nthe minority group must be politically cohesive and vote as a bloc; and (3) the white \nmajority  must  vote  sufficiently  as  a  bloc  to  enable  it  to  defeat  the  minority’s \npreferred candidate. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 49–51 (1986).2 Plaintiffs \ncannot meet the first Gingles requirement because their illustrative plans ignore \nactual  communities  of  interest  and  are  racial  gerrymanders  where  Plaintiffs \nrepeatedly passed over one race of voters to reach another. \nA. Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans fail to observe communities of interest \nWhile there are few bright-line rules on compactness, “the § 2 compactness \ninquiry should take into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining \ncommunities of interest and traditional boundaries.” Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. \n74, 91-92 (1997). And States are not allowed to ignore the things that bind voters \ntogether economically, socially and culturally in order to draw districts primarily on \nthe basis of race: “Legitimate yet differing communities of interest should not be \ndisregarded in the interest of race.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 434. \nThe State proved that the Legislature respected strong communities of interest \nwhen it drew the First and Second Districts in 2011. Congressman Byrne and former \n2 “The reason that a minority group making such a challenge must show, as a threshold \nmatter, that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember district is this: Unless minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the \nabsence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot claim to have been injured by that \nstructure or practice.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50 n.17 \n6 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 11 of 32\nCongressman Bonner explained that the First District is bound together by the \nhighway and river system, Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and employers that \ncenter around the Port of Mobile. Tr. 667-674, 677-681, 765-775. Mobile and \nBaldwin Counties are closely tied together, much more so today than in the 1960s, \nbefore  the  tourism  industry  developed  in  Baldwin  County  and  before  the \ndevelopment of highways that made commuting feasible. Tr. 679, 744-748, 771. It \nis an area in Alabama with a unique history, such as Spanish and French influence, \nthe origination of Mardi Gras, and all the attributes that come from being Alabama’s \nonly coastal region. Tr. 671, 674, 677, 778. As Mr. Bonner testified, “There is \ndefinitely a chemistry … that exists in this [the First] district that is unique.” Tr. 765.  \nDistrict 2 in the 2011 plan also respects a community of interest, but a \ndifferent one. District 2, centered on the Wiregrass region and including portions of \nMontgomery, has a military and agrarian focus. Tr. 683, 780-81. While District 1 \nhas military interests (a Navy shipyard), the military interests in District 1 are \ndifferent from those in District 2. Tr. 683. And while District 1 also has agriculture, \nit is a different kind of agriculture than that found in District 2. Tr. 687-688, 768-69. \nMobile and Montgomery are two separate economies, Tr. 688, 690, and Mobile and \nthe Wiregrass share no communities of interest, Tr. 686. People from the Wiregrass \ndo not come in to Mobile to work, Tr. 687, 766, and the industries in the Wiregrass \ndo not use the port, Tr. 687. The two regions have no common interests and someone \n7 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 12 of 32\nfrom Mobile who was called to represent the Wiregrass would have to learn their \n“culture, way of life, [and] economic engine.” Tr. 782. \nYet  Plaintiffs  would  overlook  these  existing  communities  of  interest  to \nconnect  urban  Mobile  County  (or  at  least  the  parts  that  are  heavily  African-\nAmerican) with Montgomery, for a new District 2, and to connect rural Mobile \nCounty (or at least the parts that are heavily white) with the Wiregrass for a new \nDistrict  1,  both  drawn  on  the  basis  of  race.  The  resulting  districts  would  be \npractically impossible to represent effectively. Travel throughout the districts would \nbe quite difficult, limiting a Representative’s ability to hold town hall meetings and \nconnect with constituents. Tr. 684, 686, 775-776. It would be difficult to find the \nbudget for sufficient offices and staff to serve such a broad area. Tr. 689. Moreover, \nby combining the diverse interests of two separate communities, a Congressman \nwould have too many different areas of focus to address any of them effectively. Tr. \n685, 782-83. It would be very difficult to focus on the seafood industry and the port \nand  the  shipyard  and  peanut  subsidies  and  cattle  ranching  and  Army/Airforce \naviation and timber and give any of these diverse issues the attention they need.  \nPlaintiffs’ districts would therefore be harmful to all voters, of all races, in \ntheir proposed districts. Plaintiffs’ districts would be so difficult to represent, they \nwould impede the ability of a Representative to address the very issues Plaintiffs \ncare about, such as health care, education and criminal justice. Tr. 754-55. As the \n8 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 13 of 32\nSupreme Court noted, districts like Plaintiffs’ that ignore communities of interest \nwould in fact diminish the ability of African-American voters to participate in the \nelectoral process: \nThe practical consequence of drawing a district to cover two distant, \ndisparate communities is that one or both groups will be unable to \nachieve their political goals. Compactness is, therefore, about more \nthan ‘style points;’ it is critical to advancing the ultimate purposes of \n§ 2, ensuring minority groups equal opportunity to participate in the \npolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.”  \nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 434 (emphasis added). \nIt is no answer that Alabama drew Board of Education Districts that are at \nleast somewhat similar to Plaintiffs’ proposals. The job of a Board of Education \nmember is far different from the job of a member of Congress. Tr. 697-99, 825. \nMoreover, the existing Board of Education districts are difficult to represent, and a \nBoard  member  from  Montgomery  cannot  do  an  effective  job  of  representing \nSouthwest Alabama, despite the best of intentions. Tr. 740, 749. \nNor can Plaintiffs point to communities of interest that their proposed districts \nserve. Mr. Cooper did not even talk to anyone in Alabama about communities of \ninterest when drawing the illustrative plans, Tr. 112, and it shows. Plaintiffs say, for \ntheir District 1, that rural Mobile County and Houston County are both “rural,” Tr. \n135, but so what? Double Springs is rural, too, but that doesn’t mean it shares any \nreal interests with Bayou La Batre. Plaintiffs say, for their District 2, that Mobile and \nMontgomery are both urban areas, Tr. 388-389, but so what? Huntsville is urban too, \n9 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 14 of 32\nbut that doesn’t mean that people’s livelihood in Huntsville depends on the Airbus \nplant, or that people in Mobile care much about rockets.  \nAnd then Mr. Cooper testified about the Black Belt region being a community \nof interest that he wanted to put back together. Tr. 65. That sounds nice, but the fact \nis that Mr. Cooper never once, in four plans, includes the entire Black Belt region in \na single district (he divides it each time between Districts 2 and 7).  \nThere is no legitimate argument that Black voters in Mobile are part of the \nsame community of interest as Black voters in Montgomery, unless one is defining \nthe community of interest solely in terms of race. While race can be a permissible \nconsideration in districting – and is one of many factors defining community of \ninterest in Alabama’s districting guidelines – defining a community of interest on \nthe sole factor of race makes the impermissible assumption that voters of the same \nrace all think alike and have the same needs from a Congressional representative, no \nmatter where they live, their education, their profession, or anything else.  \nHistorically, at least since the 1970s when Alabama first was allocated seven \nCongressional districts, Districts 1 and 2 have been remarkably stable, encompassing \nthe same areas of the State after each redistricting cycle, except for changes on the \nmargins as necessary to equalize population among the districts. Exhibits P-101, \nP0102; Tr. 642, 765, 952-952, 987; Doc. 95 ¶¶ 53, 67-68. See also Tr. 633-634 \n(Gerald Dial testifying that current guidelines make preserving the core of district a \n10 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 15 of 32\npriority even without express language). This stability shows that the Alabama \nLegislature has long recognized the communities of interest in Districts 1 and 2. Tr. \n642, 765. \nPlaintiffs’ plans do not recognize communities of interest, but instead connect \ngeographically distant voters for no reason other than race. See Bush v. Vera, 517 \nU.S. 952, 979 (1996) (holding that a district that “reaches out to grab small and \napparently isolated minority communities” is not reasonably compact.). For all these \nreasons,  Section  2  did  not  require  Alabama  to  draw  two  majority-minority \nCongressional  districts  in  2011,  when  doing  so  would  have  required  ignoring \nlegitimate communities of interest.3\nB. Plaintiffs’ plans are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders \nNot only does Section 2 not require Alabama to draw districts that elevate race \nabove traditional districting criteria, the Constitution prohibits it. \nInstead of districts based on the communities of interest that the Supreme \nCourt says we should care about, Plaintiffs ask for districts drawn along racial lines. \nIn their illustrative plans, Plaintiffs repeatedly skip over some voters to get to others, \n3 It has long been established that § 2 does not require maximization of majority-minority \ndistricts: “[R]eading the first Gingles condition in effect to define dilution as a failure to maximize \nin the face of bloc voting (plus some other incidents of societal bias to be expected where bloc \nvoting occurs) causes its own dangers, and they are not to be courted. … One may suspect vote \ndilution from political famine, but one is not entitled to suspect (much less infer) dilution from \nmere failure to guarantee a political feast. … Failure to maximize cannot be the measure of § 2.” \nJohnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1016-17 (1994). \n11 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 16 of 32\nand they do so along racial lines. Tr. 972, 977-984. In drawing District 1, Plaintiffs \nskipped over minority voters to make a whiter district, and in drawing District 2, \nPlaintiffs skipped over white voters to make a majority-minority district. Dr. Doug \nJohnson’s color-coded maps demonstrate how, especially in the City of Mobile, Mr. \nCooper divided voters along racial lines. Tr. 985-87 and Ex. D-13.4\nThis  is  related  to  the  compactness  analysis.  Dr.  Johnson  testified  that \nPlaintiffs’ districts 1 and 2 are not compact because of Plaintiffs’ racial sorting. Tr. \n981, 984. The racial gerrymandering therefore defeats Plaintiffs’ Section 2 claim \n(Plaintiffs have not satisfied the Gingles prerequisites because their districts are not \ncompact). It also shows that Alabama could not have drawn such districts in 2011 \nbecause doing so would have violated the Constitution. No traditional districting \nprinciple explains the decisions to sort voters by race. Tr. 993-997. Race is the only \nexplanation  for  the  decision  to  split  Mobile  County,  to  separate  Mobile  from \nBaldwin Counties, and to connect Mobile with unrelated Dothan and Montgomery. \nPlaintiffs’ plans are therefore racial gerrymanders that would violate the Equal \nProtection rights of Alabama voters, and consequently, Plaintiffs have not shown \n4 The fact that Plaintiffs’ map-drawer observed some of the traditional criteria, such as \navoiding splitting some precincts and counties, does not mean that their map is not a racial \ngerrymander. “Race may predominate even when a reapportionment plan respects traditional \nprinciples … if ‘[r]ace was the criterion that … could not be compromised,’ and race-neutral \nconsiderations ‘came into play only after the race-based decision had been made.’” Bethune-Hill \nv. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 798 (2017) (quoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, \n907 (1996)). \n12 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 17 of 32\nthat they have a proper remedy. Davis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1419 (11th Cir. \n1998). \nPlaintiffs’ proposed racial gerrymandering would violate the constitutional \nrights of voters and harm them in two ways: The voters would be “personally … \nsubjected to [a] racial classification,” Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 957 (1996), and \nthey would be represented by a Representative who believes her or his “primary \nobligation is to represent only the members” of a particular racial group, Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 648 (1993). “When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, \nit engages in the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, \nbecause of their race, think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer \nthe same candidates at the polls.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 911-912 (1995) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIf the Alabama Legislature had passed any of Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans, they \nwould  have  been  subject  to  strict  scrutiny,  and  they  would  have  failed.  The \nLegislature could not have argued that it had a compelling interest to comply with \nSection 2, because Section 2 does not require States to ignore communities of \ninterest to draw districts based on race. LULAC, 548 U.S. at 433; see also Abrams, \n521 U.S. at 91-92 (“[Section] 2 does not require a State to create, on predominantly \n13 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 18 of 32\nracial lines, a district that is not ‘reasonably compact.’”).5\nThere are good reasons why the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the \ntype of race-based districting that Plaintiffs propose. “Racial gerrymandering, even \nfor remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions; it threatens \nto carry us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer \nmatters—a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and to \nwhich the Nation continues to aspire.” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 657 (1993).6\nNo one claims that any State is free of all private racism, but Alabama has \ncome a long way from the days of Us and Them. Drawing districts that are Theirs \nand  Ours  would  set  us  back.  It  would  also  be  illegal,  meaning  the  Alabama \nLegislature  could  not  have  drawn  those  districts  in  2011.  Plaintiffs’  racially-\ngerrymandered districts therefore do not satisfy their Gingles burden. \nC. A plan with two majority-minority Congressional districts would \nnot have been precleared because it would have diminished the \nopportunity of minority voters to elect their candidate of choice \nIn 2011, Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act, and Alabama’s congressional plans therefore had to be precleared by the \nU.S. Department of Justice. Doc. 95 ¶ 66. A plan that could not have been precleared \n5 As discussed in pretrial briefing, the State rejects any assumption that compliance with a \nfederal statute can serve as a compelling interest to justify violating a voter’s Constitutional rights. \n6 Congressman Byrne testified that dividing Mobile along racial lines would not only be \nmorally wrong, but it would also harm economic development in the region. Tr. 693-94. \n14 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 19 of 32\ndoes not satisfy Plaintiffs’ burden because such a plan could not have been put in \nplace in 2011. \nPlaintiffs’ illustrative plans would drop the African-American voting age \nmajority in District 7 to barely over 50%. It has been performing in the low to mid-\n60s range, but if a 50% district would not have provided African-American voters \nwith the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice in 2012, it would have \ndiminished that opportunity and would not have been precleared. \nPlaintiffs rely on Dr. Palmer’s analysis that showed that in the 2018 elections, \nAfrican-Americans were a majority of the actual electorate in Plaintiffs’ majority-\nblack districts. That is irrelevant, though. How the districts performed in 2018 does \nnot tell us how they performed in any earlier election, and the relevant question is \nwhether DOJ would have precleared the plans in 2011. DOJ obviously could not \nreview the results of a future election. Plaintiffs therefore have no evidence that their \ndistricts would in fact have provided a real opportunity to elect for minority voters \nin 2011.  \nOn the other hand, there is ample evidence that the illustrative plans would \nnot have been precleared:  \n(1) No one in 2011 was asking that two majority-black districts be drawn. Tr. \n627, 807-808, 816. As active as Joe Reed and the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus \nhave been in redistricting over the years, see Tr. 584, 626-627, it is not plausible that \n15 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 20 of 32\nthey would have failed to make such a request if anyone thought that DOJ would \napprove such a plan. \n(2) It was well known that Senator Hank Sanders believed that an opportunity \ndistrict should be around 62-65% black voting age population (BVAP), and he was \nan experienced politician who faced elections every four years in part of the area \nincluded in Plaintiffs’ proposed districts. Tr. 643. He says now that his opinion was \nfor State Legislative districts only, but there is no evidence that in 2011 he was \narguing that a lower percentage would suffice in Congressional districts. \n(3) The Alabama Congressional delegation in 2011 proposed a plan to the \nLegislature that they supported, including Rep. Terry Sewell. Tr. 622-24, 807-808. \nRep.  Sewell  is  a  Harvard-educated  attorney  who  has  served  her  district  with \ndistinction and who is a credit to the State of Alabama. There is simply no way that \nshe would have designed and supported a plan that diluted the rights of minority \nvoters. Tr. 810. It was reasonable for the Legislature to rely on Rep. Sewell’s view \nthat the district she drew and supported was legal and fair to minority voters, as well \nas her view of what was necessary for her African-American constituents to have an \nequal opportunity to participate in the electoral process. Tr. 658. \n(4) Rep. Sewell had close relationships with President and First Lady Obama, \nas well as Attorney General Eric Holder. Tr. 811. When the delegation met to \ndevelop a plan to propose to the Alabama Legislature, Rep. Sewell offered to help \n16 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 21 of 32\nensure that the plan was precleared by the Holder Department of Justice. Tr. 811. It \nwas reasonable for the Legislature to rely on Rep. Sewell’s knowledge of what was \nnecessary to achieve preclearance in this particular case, particularly in light of her \ncharacter and the inconceivability that she would intentionally harm her own voters.  \n(5) It is also telling that, even though there was a challenge to the State’s \nlegislative districts by the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, no one sued about the \nCongressional districts until this case was filed in 2018, and no Legislators or local \npoliticians are parties to this suit. That suggests that nobody seriously believed in \n2011 that a 50% BVAP district had a chance of being precleared.  \n(6) There were many other reasons to believe that a barely 50% BVAP district \nwould not have performed in 2011: The white population in Alabama tends to be \nolder, as Mr. Cooper acknowledged, and therefore white voters are over-represented \nin the voting age population. Tr. 34. In most elections, African-American voters turn \nout at slightly lower rates than white voters. Tr. 881-883. The census isn’t perfect, \nand Plaintiffs’ margins are so thin, they are within the margin of error for the census \nresults, leading Dr. Johnson to testify that it is at best a “coin toss” of whether in \nreality the districts reach 50% BVAP. Tr. 969-971. And finally, some 50% districts \nresult in the election of white Republicans. An example of this is the Mississippi \nSenate district that is involved in litigation where Plaintiffs’ expert Max Palmer is \nan expert witness, and in that district, Plaintiffs are suing to increase the black voting \n17 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 22 of 32\nage population from 50% to 62% because it hasn’t been performing. Tr. 184-85.  \nWhile Plaintiffs point to Rep. Sewell’s “landslide” victories, Senator Sanders \ncorrectly testified that landslides should not be a consideration when deciding the \nBlack voting age percentage necessary to provide an opportunity to elect to minority \nvoters. Tr. 593-94. Rep. Sewell is a special politician, and it would not be reasonable \nto assume that she will serve for all time. \nThe evidence thus shows that Plaintiffs’ plans would have stood little chance \nof  being  precleared.  To  submit  them  would  have  been  foolish,  because  the \nLegislature  knew  that  if  preclearance  was  denied,  it  would  have  required  an \nexpensive special session to rush through an alternative plan that itself might not be \nprecleared. Tr. 620. Thus, Plaintiffs’ illustrative plans do not satisfy the first Gingles\nprerequisite.7\nD. A note on the Gingles prerequisites 2 and 3 (polarized voting) \nThe State does not dispute that, at least in most elections, black voters and \n7 By arguing that the law neither requires nor allows the State to draw the race-centric \ndistricts Plaintiffs propose, Alabama is by no means saying that there is a quota or a limit on \nmajority-minority districts. The number of such districts Alabama will have depends on traditional \ndistricting criteria and the distribution of the population. Alabama would not be against drawing \nmore majority-minority districts if it could do so while observing communities of interest and \nwithout violating the constitutional rights of Alabama voters. Plaintiffs may attempt to argue that \nSenator Dial testified that additional districts were against the principles and philosophies of the \nState, see Tr. 653-654, but he testified that it would be perfectly fine if all seven Congressional \nDistricts sent African-Americans to Congress. Tr. 658. It is clear that he meant that additional \nmajority-minority districts would be against the principles and philosophies of Alabama if, like \nPlaintiffs’ districts, they broke up communities of interest in order to sort voters by race. \n18 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 23 of 32\nwhite voters tend to prefer different candidates. Specifically, black voters tend to \nsupport Democrats in most elections, and most white voters in Alabama usually \nsupport Republicans. Tr. 341, 885-888; Ex. D11 at 14-16. What the State disputes is \nthat polarized voting necessarily means that the system is broken, or that the Court \nshould infer that Republican votes are evidence of racial bias. \nAs Defense expert Trey Hood showed, African-Americans overwhelmingly \nsupport the Democratic party everywhere. He studied elections in all 21 States where \nAfrican-Americans are at least 10% of the population, and in each State – North, \nSouth, East, and West – African-American support for the Democratic party neared \nor exceeded 90%. Tr. 885-888; Ex. D11 at 14-16. Consequently, voting is polarized \nanywhere that most white voters tend to support Republican candidates. Polarized \nvoting alone tells us only that a majority of white voters in the jurisdiction are \nconservative. As discussed further below, Alabama does not agree with Plaintiffs’ \nargument that conservatism or support for Republican candidates is by definition a \nsign of racism. \nIV. Totality of the Circumstances \nIf the Court agrees that the case is moot or that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy \nthe Gingles prerequisites, it need not address the “totality of the circumstances.” \nShould the Court decide otherwise, the question is whether, under the totality of the \ncircumstances, and as a result of Alabama’s Congressional districts, “the political \n19 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 24 of 32\nprocesses leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are \nnot equally open to participation by” the members of the minority group, on account \nof race. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).8 (Section (a) of the Act notes that any denial or \nabridgement of the right to vote must be “on account of race or color.” 52 U.S.C. § \n10301(a)). Such an inquiry necessitates a “comprehensive, not limited, canvassing \nof relevant facts.” Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011 (1994).9\nHere,  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  weighs  against  a  finding  of  vote \ndilution on account of race or color. Plaintiffs center their argument around the \nvarious “Senate factors” (which are not part of the text of Section 2). They raise \nAlabama’s history of discrimination, and Alabama neither denies nor attempts to \nexcuse  that  shameful  history.  But  it’s  just  that:  history.  As  Dr.  McCrary \n8 Section 2(b), 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b), provides:  \nA violation of [Section 2(a)] is established if, based on the totality of \ncircumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or \nelection in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by \nmembers of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have \nless opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political \nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which members \nof a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision \nis one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this \nsection establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers \nequal to their proportion in the population.  \n9 While the Gingles Court held that satisfying the three prerequisites is necessary to prove \na § 2 claim, “it just as clearly declined to hold them sufficient” by themselves to establish a claim. \nJohnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011 (1994). That is, to prevail on a Section 2 claim, \nPlaintiffs  must  satisfy  the  Gingles  prerequisites  and  show  that,  under  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances, they have less opportunity to participate in the political process on account of race \nor color.  \n20 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 25 of 32\nacknowledged, it has been a very long time since Alabama had a literacy test or a \npoll tax or anything of the sort. Tr. 314. The Supreme Court admonishes that “history \ndid not end in 1965” and that the purpose of the Fifteenth Amendment is “not to \npunish  the  past.”  Shelby  Cty.,  Ala.  v.  Holder,  570  U.S.  529,  552-53  (2013). \nMoreover, “past discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn \ngovernmental action that is not itself unlawful.” City of Mobile, Ala. v. Bolden, 446 \nU.S. 55, 74 (1980). \nIn terms of more recent history, Plaintiffs talk about Alabama’s photo ID law, \nbut as this Court held in a challenge to that law, Alabama’s photo ID law does not \ndiscriminate against anyone. See Tr. 319-21.10 In the case of photo ID, which passed \ncourt scrutiny, or felon voting, which is presently being challenged in federal court,11\nPlaintiffs merely allege that the voting practices are discriminatory when no court \nhas found that to be true.  \nA more accurate picture of Twenty-first Century Alabama comes from the \ntestimony about Mobile. The city is becoming more racially integrated over time, \nwith more African American families moving to the suburbs and more white voters \nmoving downtown. Tr. 715. The City of Mobile elected an African-American mayor \n10 Judge Coogler’s decision granting summary judgment for the State can be found at \nGreater Birmingham Ministries v. Merrill, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1253 (N.D. Ala. 2018). That decision \nis presently on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit.  \n11 Alabama’s felon voting laws are presently being challenged in Thompson v. Alabama, \nCivil Action No. 2:16-cv-783-ECM (M.D. Ala.). \n21 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 26 of 32\nwhen it was a majority-white city, and it elected a white mayor when it was a \nmajority-black city. Tr. 779. The same is true for the nearby city of Prichard, which \nlikewise elected a black mayor with a majority-white populace and a white mayor \nwith a majority-black populace. Tr. 779. And while Plaintiffs attempted to paint the \nmayoral elections in Mobile as racially polarized, we believe the Court should credit \nPlaintiff Lakeisha Chestnut over internet news sites (see Tr. 843): Chestnut testified \nat deposition that Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson, a white Republican, received \noverwhelming support from black voters. Tr. 752, 851-852. \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  that  African-American  voters  lag  behind  white \nAlabamians in various socio-economic factors. That is regrettably true, but it is true \neverywhere, not just in Alabama. Tr. 891-94. It does not occur only in Southern \nStates, or former slave States, or States that once had Jim Crow laws. It is just as true \nin New York and New Jersey as it is in Alabama, and this socio-economic gap is \ntherefore not tied to discrimination in Alabama, nor does this fact alone show that a \npolitical system is broken. Admittedly, there is evidence that a voter’s participation \nin elections can be tied to economic and education levels, but that is as true for white \nvoters of lower economic and education levels as it is for African-American voters. \nPlaintiffs also point to alleged racial appeals in elections, such as ads run by \nChief Justice Tom Parker. They complain about the ad’s references to “mob rule” \n(but the ads came right after mobs disrupted Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation \n22 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 27 of 32\nhearings, which were referenced in the ads) and Chief Justice Parker’s statement that \nhe had taken on Southern Poverty Law Center. Parker’s dispute with the SPLC was \nabout  traditional  marriage,  not  race;  Parker  publicly  commented  on  marriage \nlitigation while a judge and the SPLC filed an ethics complaint that led to an inquiry \nby  the  Alabama  Judicial  Inquiry  Commission.  See  Parker  v.  Judicial  Inquiry \nComm’n of Ala., 295 F. Supp. 3d 1292, 1295-96 (M.D. Ala. 2018) (noting the facts \nleading to the complaint against Chief Justice Parker).12\nPlaintiffs  also  point  to  an  ad  by  Governor  Ivey  discussing  the  Alabama \nMemorial Preservation Act, Ala. Code § 41-9-231 et seq. But that statute does not \nsingle  out  “Civil  War”  memorials;  it  protects  all  memorials  of  a  certain  age, \nincluding civil rights memorials.13 And Plaintiffs talk about statements Rep. Mo \n12 No reasonable person would dispute the genesis of Chief Justice Parker’s dispute with \nSPLC, as reported in Judge Watkins’ opinion, and this Court can take judicial notice thereof. \nUnited States v. Jones, 29 F.3d 1549, 1553 (11th Cir. 1994). \n13 The Memorial Preservation Act protects the following: \n(a)  No  architecturally  significant  building,  memorial \nbuilding, memorial street, or monument which is located on public \nproperty and has been so situated for 40 or more years may be \nrelocated, removed, altered, renamed, or otherwise disturbed. \n(b)  No  architecturally  significant  building,  memorial \nbuilding, memorial street, or monument which is located on public \nproperty and has been so situated for at least 20 years, and less than \n40 years, may be relocated, removed, altered, renamed, or otherwise \ndisturbed except as provided in Section 41-9-235. \n23 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 28 of 32\nBrooks supposedly made on the radio in Huntsville, which is hardly relevant to \nanything in the First, Second, or Seventh Districts that this case is about. And in any \nevent, Plaintiffs do not explain how any of these ads differ from Senator Sanders’ \nrobocall racial appeal in the 2010 elections. See Tr. 598-99. \nThen there is the question of whether any vote dilution is “on account of race \nor color.” The Eleventh Circuit has held that “to be actionable, a deprivation of the \nminority group's right to equal participation in the political process must be on \naccount of a classification, decision, or practice that depends on race or color, not on \naccount of some other racially neutral cause.” Solomon v. Liberty Cty. Comm’rs, 221 \nF.3d 1218, 1225 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, \n1515 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (Tjoflat, C.J., plurality opinion)).14\nPlaintiffs’ response is to argue that one of our two major political parties is \nracially biased per se. One Plaintiff (Jones) testified, “Being a Republican for me, \n(c) No memorial school which is located on public property \nand has been so situated for 20 or more years may be renamed except \nas provided in Section 41-9-235. \nAla. Code § 41-9-232. \n14 The State of Alabama preserves its position that part of a plaintiff’s required showing \nunder the polarized voting analysis includes demonstrating that race, and not partisan politics, \nexplains the voting patterns of the body politic, as the Fifth Circuit held in League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 850 (5th Cir. 1993). To resolve this case, it is not \nnecessary for this Court to decide whether the “on account of race or color” requirement applies \nin the Gingles prerequisites or in the “totality of the circumstances” analysis. Solomon makes clear \nthat in the Eleventh Circuit, it is a requirement at some point in the Court’s analysis; where it \napplies is not important in this particular case.  \n24 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 29 of 32\nseeing somebody who is a Republican right now tells me that they’re racist.” Tr. \n233. When asked, “Does voting for Republican candidates render the voter racist,” \nPlaintiff Jones responded with a simple “Yes.” Tr. 245. Another witness for the \nPlaintiffs (Knight) testified that the Republican Party “seems to be kind of one-sided \nwhen it comes to racial justice.” Tr. 343. Commissioner Tyson testified that a \nmember of Congress has to support the initiatives of the Democratic party “to \nrepresent everyone in his constituency.” Tr. 526. \nThese witnesses are of course free to support any party they choose, but so are \nother Alabamians, and it would be a dangerous use of the Voting Rights Act to \ninterpret it to allow Federal courts to step in and “fix” a State’s electoral system \nsimply because some voters prefer Republicans. It is hardly a secret that Alabama is \ngenerally  a  conservative  State,  or  that  the  Republican  party  is  the  home  for \nconservative voters. Tr. 203, 955. There are many reasons a voter might tend to \nsupport candidates of a particular party, including their positions on issues such as \nabortion,  gun  rights,  and  national  defense.  Dr.  Hood  noted  that  there  was  a \nrealignment of Southern voters in the 1970s and 1980s based on religious beliefs. \nTr. 952-953. As Congressman Byrne testified, he is a Republican because the Party’s \nphilosophy  of  a  smaller,  less-intrusive  government  is  more  consistent  with  his \npersonal  beliefs.  Tr.  708-709.  In  short,  Plaintiffs  have  not  proven  that  voting \nRepublican violates the Voting Rights Act, and an attempt to use it to put a thumb \n25 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 30 of 32\non the scale in favor of one political party would put the Voting Rights Act on shaky \nconstitutional ground. \nIn the end, “The Voting Rights Act does not guarantee that nominees of the \nDemocratic Party will be elected, even if black voters are likely to favor that party’s \ncandidates. Rather, § 2 is implicated only where Democrats lose because they are \nblack, not where blacks lose because they are Democrats.” Clements, 999 F.2d at \n854 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nFor these reasons, even if Plaintiffs had met their burden under the Gingles \nprerequisites, their Section 2 claim still fails under the “totality of the circumstances” \nanalysis. That said, Defendant believes that the Court need not reach this issue, \nbecause  it  is  clear,  as  discussed  above,  that  Plaintiffs’  non-compact,  racially-\ngerrymandered  illustrative  plans  do  not  satisfy  their  burden  under  the  Gingles \nprerequisites. \nV. Conclusion \nDefendant asks that this Court enter judgment in his favor because this case \nis moot and the Court consequently lacks jurisdiction. The next census will change \nthe facts on the ground and will determine Alabama’s future districting obligations; \na declaratory judgment about what Alabama should have done ten years ago would \nbe nothing more than an advisory opinion. \nThe Court need not reach any other issue, but in the event the Court disagrees, \n26 \n8070509.2 \n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB     Document 115     Filed 12/13/19     Page 31 of 32\nit should hold that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden. The record shows that \nPlaintiffs  did  not  meet  their  Gingles  1  burden  of  showing  that  the  minority \npopulation  is  sufficiently  compact  to  form  a  voting  age  majority  in  two \nCongressional districts. They proved only that Alabama could have drawn a second \ndistrict if it ignored Supreme Court precedent, disregarded communities of interest, \nand sorted voters by race in violation of their Equal Protection rights. Plaintiffs’ \nSection 2 claim therefore fails. \n*  *  *  *  * \nPlaintiff Chestnut, testifying passionately about her love for the State, said, \n“We need to stop all this division.” Tr. 450. We agree. But we do not believe that \nsorting  voters  by  race  into  separate-but-equal  districts  will  accomplish  Ms. \nChestnut’s goal. It would instead make it worse, furthering the division. “The way \nto stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of \nrace.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schools v.

P. 12(c), on grounds that\njurisdiction over this matter lies with a three-judge court, Plaintiffs have failed to\nplead sufficient facts to demonstrate that they have a proper remedy, and Plaintiffs’\nclaims are barred by the doctrine of laches. In support of this motion, Secretary\nMerrill states as follows.\nI. Jurisdiction over this matter lies with a three-judge court.1\nIt is clear that a constitutional challenge to a state’s congressional districts\nmust be heard by a three-judge court: “A district court of three judges shall be\n1 SecretaryMerrillpreviouslyfiledaNoticeofJurisdictionalIssue,doc.12,raisingtheissue\nofwhetherathree-judgecourtwasrequiredandexplainingthatthereisauthoritybothways.

To avoid\na three-judge court, Plaintiffs bring their challenge solely under § 2 of the Voting\nRightsAct–i.e.,theymakeastatutorychallenge,notaconstitutionalone–andhave\nuniquely eschewed claims under the 14th and 15th Amendments, which otherwise\nuniformly are made together with such § 2 claims. See Page v. Bartels, 248 F.3d\n175, 190 (3rd. Cir. 2001) (observing that “statutory Voting Rights Act challenges to\nstatewide legislative apportionment are generally” so “inextricably intertwined with\nconstitutional challenges to such apportionment” that they “should be considered a\nsingle ‘action’ within the meaning of § 2284(a)”); see also Johnson v.

July 31, 2018) (Mem. in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. to\nDismiss a parallel challenge to Louisiana’s congressional districts, ECF No. 16-1, at\n3 n.1 (pointing out the rarity of reapportionment challenges that do not include\nclaims under the 14th and 15th Amendments as well as § 2 of the Voting Rights\nAct))(attached as Exhibit A).\n2 The instant case, Chestnut, is one of three cases challenging congressional districts\nreportedlyfiledundertheaegisoftheNationalDemocraticRedistrictingCommittee,styledasthe\nNational Redistricting Foundation.

Ardoin, in the memorandum\ncited above, § 2 claims are so like a constitutional challenge, and the claims are so\nintertwined, that this action must likewise be heard by a three-judge court. To be\nclear, Secretary Merrill does not prefer one forum over another. However, the issue\nis a jurisdictional one and, if the matter is heard by a single District Court Judge\nwhen jurisdiction lies elsewhere, the litigation would be a nullity. Better to decide\nthe issue on the front-end.\nThere is good reason to consider a § 2 claim to be a form of constitutional\nchallenge. The Voting Rights Act was enacted under Congress’ “power to enforce\ntheprovisions ofthe Fifteenth Amendment.” Cityof Boerne v.Flores,521 U.S.507,\n518 (1997).As the Supreme Court noted in City of Mobile v. Bolden, “Section2 was\nan uncontroversial provision in proposed legislation whose other provisions\nengendered protracted dispute. … The view that this section simply restated the\nprohibitions already contained in the Fifteenth Amendment was expressed without\ncontradiction during the Senate hearings.” 446 U.S. 55, 61 (1980). The text of the\nFifteenth Amendment (“[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not\nbe denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color,\nor previous condition of servitude ….”) is largely repeated in the text of Section 2\n(“[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or\nprocedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a\n3\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 4 of 24\nmanner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the\nUnited States to vote on account of race or color …”). Plaintiffs’ claim is thus in\nessenceaconstitutionalone,andthereisnopracticaldifferenceinthewaythisclaim\nwillbe litigated,or decided,under § 2 andhowit would have been treated if brought\nunder the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment directly.\nFor these and other reasons, the Third Circuit held that 28 U.S.C. § 2284\nshould be construed to reach claims brought under the Voting Rights Act. Page v.\nBartels, 248 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 2001). In Page, challengers of New Jersey’s\nlegislative reapportionment scheme brought claims under both the Constitution and\nSection 2, and the District Court of New Jersey denied challengers’ application for\nrelief without convening a three-judge court. The Third Circuit vacated the district\ncourt’s decision and remanded the case for consideration bya “district court of three\njudges” after deciding that a three-judge court did have jurisdiction to consider the\nSection2 claims. Page,248 F.3dat189.The Third Circuitnotedthat claims brought\nunder Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (the preclearance regime that previously\napplied to some states) were expressly referred to a three-judge court, see 52 U.S.C.\n§ 10304, and that there was no such express referral for Section 2 claims. Page, 248\nF.3d at 189. Nonetheless, the Third Circuit in Page held that “[w]e do not believe\nthat Congress made a deliberate choice to distinguish between constitutional\n4\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 5 of 24\napportionment challenges and apportionment challenges brought under § 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act.” Id.\nThe court reasoned that “when the three-judge court statutes were revised in\n1976 to require that this specialized tribunal hear challenges to the ‘constitutionality\nof … the apportionment of any statewide legislative body,’ § 2 of the Voting Rights\nAct was not available to litigants seeking to challenge apportionment.” Page, 248\nF.3d at 189. Plaintiffs did not use Section 2 to challenge apportionment plans until\nafter the Supreme Court determined that Section 2 provided a private right of action,\nsee City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 60 (1980), and recognized the legal\nframework for vote dilution claims, see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986).\nThat is, when Congress provided that three-judge courts were required for\nconstitutional challenges to congressional districting plans, it could not have meant\nto exclude Section 2 claims because there were no Section 2 challenges to\ncongressional plans.\nThe Page court emphasized that the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. § 2284\nshows that “Congress was concerned less with the source of the law on which an\napportionmentchallengewasbasedthanontheuniqueimportanceofapportionment\ncasesgenerally.TheSenateReport,forexample,consistentlystatesthat‘three-judge\ncourts would be retained … in any case involving congressional reapportionment.’”\n248 F.3d at 190 (emphasis added, citing S. Rep. No. 94-204 (1976)). Moreover, all\n5\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 6 of 24\nthe reasons why Congress called for three judges to decide constitutional challenges\ntoapportionmentplans–theimportanceoftheclaimandthesensitivityofthematter\n– apply equally to a Section 2 challenge. Id.\nPage obviously is not binding on this Court, and its specific holding – that a\nthree-judgecourtshoulddecideSection2claimsthatarebroughtinconjunctionwith\nconstitutional claims – is not directly on point. Nonetheless, the Third Circuit’s\nreasoning in Page suggests that 28 U.S.C. § 2284 should be applied to a Section 2\nclaim even when not accompanied by constitutional claims.3\nIn response to Secretary Merrill’s initial motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs argued\nthat Alabama’s “claim that Section 2 was not available for reapportionment\nchallenges prior to 1982 seems dubious at best,” citing to a 1980 Fifth Circuit\ndecision in which Section 2 was used to challenge an at-large election scheme for a\nlocal school board. Doc. 15 at 8 n.3. This argument misses the mark. Even assuming\nstatutory vote dilution claims were possible before Congress amended the Voting\nRights Act in 1982, the point remains that in 1976, when Congress narrowed the\nscope of § 2284, they were unheard of, and 1976, not 1982, is what matters in\ndetermining Congressional intent behind that statute. As of 1976 there was no vote\n3 Given the importance of the interests at issue, it is probablyinevitable that the decision of\nthe district court will be appealed by one side or the other, and for this reason Chestnut’s refusal\ntotakeadvantageofthefarspeedierappealavailableunder§2284(a)isacontinuationbydifferent\nmeans ofherinexcusable delayincommencingthis lawsuit,whichis addressedbelow.\n6\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 7 of 24\ndilution claim under § 2; all such challenges were constitutional. E.g., Sims v.\nBaggett, 247 F. Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. 1965) (constitutional challenge to Alabama’s\nlegislative districts); Kilgarlin v. Martin, 252 F. Supp. 404 (S.D. Tex. 1966)\n(constitutional challenge to Texas’ legislative reapportionment plan); Turner v.\nMcKeithen, 490 F.2d 191 (5th Cir. 1973) (constitutional vote dilution challenge to\nproposed multimember reapportionment plan).4\nCongressional districting is important no matter how it is challenged, and a\nchallenge under § 2 implicates delicate federal-state balances just as much as a\nconstitutional challenge. This is precisely the kind of case that Congress intended to\nbe heard by a three-judge court. See Page, 248 F.3d at 189 (“We do not believe that\nCongress made a deliberate choice to distinguish between constitutional\napportionmentchallengesandchallengesbroughtunder§2oftheVotingRightsAct\n4 One court avoided the issue of § 2284’s applicability to statutory challenges by using a\npractical solution that had been discussed in the Senate Report. In Cavanaugh v. Brock, 577 F.\nSupp. 176 (E.D.N.C. 1983), a challenge to the North Carolina General Assembly’s districts,\nplaintiffs alleged violations of the state constitution – clearly not the sort of constitutional\nchallenge envisioned for § 2284. In defense, North Carolina argued that the Voting Rights Act\nrequiredittosplitprecincts(theallegedstateconstitutionalviolation),leadingthecourttoconsider\nwhether raising a federal statutory claim as a defense meant the case must be heard by a three-\njudge court. Id., 577 F. Supp. at 180 n.3 (“It is not clear to us that the invocation of a federal\ndefense implicating the Voting Rights Act also generates three-judge court jurisdiction.”). The\ncourt sidestepped the issue: “Due to the substantial likelihood that this matter is beyond the\npurview of § 2284, Circuit Judge Philips, designated as a member of the statutory three-judge\ncourt,hasalsobeendesignatedpursuantto28U.S.C.§291(b)[]tositinthealternativeasadistrict\njudge with other members of this court, with the court constituting in that mode a regular district\ncourt consisting of a panel of three district judges.”). Id. See also S. REP. 94-204, at 1994\n(suggestingthis alternative).\n7\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 8 of 24\n[astothescopeof§2284(a)]”).Consequently,theCourtshoulddismisstheamended\ncomplaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.5\nIf the Court denies this part of this motion, SecretaryMerrill respectfullyasks\nthe Court to certify the question for interlocutory appeal under 26 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\nThis issue meets the Eleventh Circuit’s requirements for such interlocutory appeal:\n(1) the issue is a pure question of law, (2) and controls at least a substantial part of\n5 An argument that this claim is not “constitutional” simply because it is brought more\nimmediately under a statute rests on the sort of “magic language” requirement that the Supreme\nCourt disavowed in Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305 (Jun. 25, 2018). In that case the Supreme\nCourt was required todetermine,forjurisdictional purposes, if athree-judge court’s orderwas an\ninjunction – and thus appealable – even though the three-judge court did not call it an injunction.\nDoing so required the Supreme Court to consider the wording of two statutes relating to\ninterlocutory appeals, 28 U.S.C. § 1253 and § 1292(a)(1): “To be sure, the District Court did not\ncallitsorders“injunctions”–infact,itdisclaimedtheterm…butthelabelattachedtoanorderis\nnot dispositive. We have previously made clear that where an order has the ‘practical effect’ of\ngranting or denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate\njurisdiction.” Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at 2319-2320. The Court then explained that although its\n“‘practical effect’ approach” was developed in cases dealing with § 1292(a)(1) [allowing appeals\nof “[i]nterlocutory orders … granting injunctions”], the approach also applies to § 1253: “The\nprovisions are also textually interlocked. Section 1292(a)(1) does not apply where direct review\nmaybehadintheSupremeCourt, i.e., where§ 1253applies. If the ‘practical effects’test applied\nunder§1292(a)(1)butnot§1253,theconsequenceswouldbeunfortunateandstrange.Wewould\nhavetoidentifythemagiclanguageneededforanordertoqualifyasanordergrantingordenying\nan injunction ....” Abbott, 138 S. Ct. at 2320. Just as with the interlocutory appeal statutes,\nchallenges to congressional districts under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act are\ninterrelated. Page, 248 F.3d at 190 (“it is clear that questions regarding the legitimacy of an\napportionmentscheme,whetherundertheConstitutionortheVotingRightsAct…are‘intimately\nrelated’….”). The relief sought in the amended complaint (doc. 14) plainly shows that ignoring\nthis interrelation frustrates Congress’ reason in 1976 for continuing to require that challenges to\ncongressional districts be heard by three-judge courts. The “practical effect” of a successful\nchallengetoastate’scongressionaldistrictsisthesameregardlessofwhethertheclaimisbrought\nunder § 2 or under the 14th and 15th Amendments, and the claims should be treated the same.\nPage, 248 F.3d at 190 (“[W]e conclude that because statutory Voting Rights Act challenges to\nstatewide legislative apportionment are generally inextricably intertwined with constitutional\nchallenges to such apportionment, those claims should be considered a single ‘action’ within the\nmeaningof§2284(a)”).\n8\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 9 of 24\nthe case, (3) the issue would be specified by the District Court in its order (if the\nCourt agrees with this request), (4) there are substantial grounds for difference of\nopinion on the issue, and (5) resolution of the issue would reduce the amount of\nlitigation necessary if the case is remanded. See McFarlin v. Conseco Servs., LLC,\n381 F.3d 1251, 1264 (11th Cir. 2004) (specifying five requirements for granting\ninterlocutoryappeal under § 2292(b)); see also Ex. A, Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot.\nto Dismiss in Johnson, doc. 16-1, at 5-6.\nII. The Amended Complaint Fails to Demonstrate the Existence of\na Proper Remedy\nThe Amended Complaint fails to demonstrate the existence of a proper\nremedy, and that is fatal to the case on either of two theories. It is fatal as a matter\nof standing and as a matter of establishing a prima facie case.\nThe “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” has three components:\nan injuryin fact,a causal connectionbetween the injuryand the conductcomplained\nof, and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). “The party invoking federal\njurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements,” which “are not mere\npleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff[s’] case ....”\nId. In other words, a plaintiff’s failure to establish an injury redressable in the\nlitigation means that plaintiff lacks standing.\n9\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 10 of 24\nMoreover, the Eleventh Circuit has held that to satisfy the Thornburg v.\nGingles prerequisites, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have a viable remedy:\nThefirstGinglesprecondition,informedbythesecond,dictatesthatthe\nissue of remedy is part of the plaintiff's prima facie case in section 2\nvote dilution cases. As the Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he\n‘geographically compact [minority]’ and ‘minority political cohesion’\nshowings [in the Gingles threshold test] are needed to establish that the\nminority has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice\nfrom some single-member district.” Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25\n(1993)(citingGingles,478U.S.at50,n.17).Theinquiriesintoremedy\nand liability, therefore, cannot be separated: A district court must\ndetermine as part of the Gingles threshold inquiry whether it can\nfashion apermissibleremedyin theparticular contextofthe challenged\nsystem.\nNipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1530-31 (11th Cir. 1994).6 “The reason that a\nminority group making such a challenge must show, as a threshold matter, that it is\nsufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember district is this: Unless minority voters possess the potential to elect\n6 The Gingles threshold test is:\nFirst, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is\nsufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority\nin a single-member district. [] Second, the minority group must be able\nto show that it is politically cohesive. [] Third, the minority must be\nable to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc\nto enable it—in the absence of special circumstances, such as the\nminority candidate running unopposed, [] —usually to defeat the\nminority’s preferred candidate.\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986) (footnote and citations omitted).\n10\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 11 of 24\nrepresentatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot\nclaim to have been injured by that structure or practice.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 52\nn.17 (underlining added).\nThus, a plaintiff who does not plead sufficient facts to establish a proper\nremedy has failed to plead sufficient facts to establish an injury that will likely be\nredressed by a decision in her favor, and thus standing, as well as that she meets the\nGingles prerequisites to a § 2 claim. Under either theory, the claim must be\ndismissed.\nMindful of Gingles’ threshold requirement, Chestnut has alleged that “[t]he\nAfrican-American population in Alabama is sufficiently numerous and\ngeographically compact to form a majority of eligible voters – meaning a majority\nof the voting age population – in two congressional districts.” Doc. 14 ¶ 6 (footnote\nomitted), see also id. ¶ 105 (same allegation). However, she has pleaded no facts to\nsupport this conclusory allegation.\nThe modern standard for pleading a cause of action, set forth by the Supreme\nCourt in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662 (2009), is not onerous, and can be satisfied simply by alleging\nsufficient facts to show that a claimis more than speculative. As summarized by the\nEleventh Circuit:\nTo survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, the “factual allegations\nin the complaint, accepted as true, must be sufficient to raise a right to\n11\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 12 of 24\nreliefabovethespeculativelevel.”BellAtl.Corp.v.Twombly,550U.S.\n544, 555 (2007). In other words, a complaint must contain sufficient\nfactual matter to “state a claimto relief that is plausible on its face.” Id.\nat 570. The well-pled facts in the complaint must be sufficient to\n“permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of\nmisconduct.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).\nA complaint that offers “labels and conclusions,” a “formulaic\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action,” or “naked assertions\ndevoid of further factual enhancement“ will not be sufficient to\nwithstand a motion to dismiss. (internal quotation marks omitted;\nalteration adopted). Likewise, we have stated that “conclusory\nallegations, unwarranted deductions of facts[,] or legal conclusions\nmasqueradingasfactswillnotpreventdismissal.”OxfordAssetMgmt.,\nLtd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).\nLopez v. United States, 656 F. App’x 957, 963 (11th Cir. July 15, 2016) (parallel\ncitations omitted); see also, e.g., Mallory v. Biomet, 2014 WL 6890740, at *5 (M.D.\nAla. Dec. 4, 2014) (same). As further summarized by this Court, “Pleadings that\ncontain nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\ndo not meet Rule 8 standards.” Teitel v. Capell Howard, P.C., 2018 WL 525296, at\n*3 (N.D. Ala. 2018) (internal quotation marks removed).\nChestnut’s amended complaint does not meet this pleading standard. Merely\nasserting in ¶¶ 6 and 105 that the “African-American population in Alabama is\nsufficiently numerous and geographically compact to form a majority of eligible\nvoters … in two congressional districts” is an example of the sort of “formulaic\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action” and “naked assertion[] devoid of\nfurther factual enhancement” that warrants dismissal. See Broward Citizens for Fair\n12\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 13 of 24\nDistrictsv.BrowardCounty,2012WL1110053,at*4-*5(N.D.Fla.2012)(granting\nmotion to dismiss where plaintiffs alleged without necessaryfactual support that the\n“voting electorate ... in Commission Districts 1 and 7 ... have become sufficiently\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority of those districts”).\nTwombly and Iqbal, along with the Eleventh Circuit’s and this Court’s cases\nconstruing them, require more than the conclusory allegations pleaded in ¶¶ 6 and\n105 of the amended complaint. They require Chestnut to have pleaded enough facts\nto move her complaint across the line from speculative to “plausible on its face.”\nTo be specific, to meet the first Gingles requirement, Chestnut was required\nto include in her pleading a map7 showing that the district she proposes could, as a\nmatter of fact, have been drawn by Alabama. In Wright v. Sumter County Bd. of\nElections and Registrations, 2014 WL 1347427 (M.D. Ga. 2014), the court denied\na motion for preliminary injunction for similar pleading defects:\nWright did not satisfy the first Gingles factor. The Eleventh Circuit has\n‘repeatedly construed the first Gingles factor as requiring a plaintiff to\ndemonstrate the existence of a proper remedy.’ … Beyond his request\nthat the Court ‘order districts for the Sumter County, Georgia School\nBoard to have nine districts only,’ which the Court cannot command,\nWright did not propose or identify any scheme or district division—a\n7 Secretary Merrill does not foreclose the possibility of establishing Gingles’ first\nrequirement without a map – for example, Chestnut could designate all of the census blocks that\nwould be included in a Gingles-compliant district, but that would be a very cumbersome thing to\ndo. As a practical matter, a map, with the usual accompanying population reports, is the most\nobvious way to show compliance with Gingles, particularly given that at some point in the\nlitigation Chestnut will have to produce an actual map, and it is difficult to believe that Chestnut\ncommenced this expensive litigation without a concrete reason for believing that she could meet\nGingles’first requirement.\n13\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 14 of 24\nbenchmark—that would provide black voters better access to the\npolitical process. ‘[A] court cannot determine whether the voting\nstrength of a minority has been impermissibly diluted without having\nsome alternative electoral structure in mind for comparison.’ ...\nWright’s failure to identify an alternative scheme is fatal to his dilution\nclaim.”\nId. at *2 (emphasis added; citations omitted).8\nChestnut’s failure to establish an injuryis curious, given that the relevant data\nhave been available since the 2010 Census was released February 2011 and it is fair\ntoassumethatbeforecommencingthislawsuitChestnutsoughtfactualconfirmation\nthat Alabama’s black voting-age population (BVAP) population was “sufficiently\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a [second] single-\n8 See also Broward Citizens for Fair Districts v.

Plaintiffs’ Claims are Barred by Laches\nThe 2010 Census results for the State of Alabama were released in February\n2011.ThosedatacontainedalloftheinformationthatChestnutneededorcouldhave\nused to bring the claim that she instead waited more than seven years to bring in\nJune 2018. In the intervening years, there have been four Congressional elections:\n2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 (happening now). And while the Census results have\nnot changed, their accuracy has lessened as people moved and died and were born\nover the past eight years.\nWhat’s more, we now are on the threshold of the 2020 Census, which when\nreleased in 2021 will be used to draw new congressional districts for Alabama. the\nState of Alabama expects to receive the Alabama results from the 2020 Census in\nFebruary 2021 and to start redistricting. At that time, the Legislature already will be\nin session, and will need to complete redistricting before it recesses in May (if not\nearlier) so that candidates for Congress and the Legislature can start campaigning in\n15\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 16 of 24\nnew districts for the 2022 election. If this case takes half as long as the recent 5-year\nlong legislative redistricting case9, then it will be concluded at about the time the\nLegislature takes up the 2021 redistricting. And although Plaintiffs’ counsel will\nargue that congressional redistricting is not as complicated as legislative\nredistricting, and will insist that this case can get to a final decision in fewer than 2.5\nyears, they also are insisting that this case not follow the most expeditious route to a\nfinal decision, i.e., trial before a three judge court and direct appeal to the Supreme\nCourt, instead of trial before a single judge with an appeal to the Eleventh Circuit\nand review by writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court.\nTo apply laches against Chestnut requires a showing that she delayed in\nbringing her vote dilution claim, that her delay was inexcusable, and that her\ninexcusable delay unduly prejudiced Secretary Merrill (or more broadly and\naccurately, the State of Alabama). In re Woide, 730 F. App’x 731, 736 (11th Cir.\n9 Redistricting cases are neither simple nor quicklyresolved; theyalmost always involve at\nleast one appeal, and often a remand that the trial court must act upon. For example, Abbott v.\nPerez, the challenge to Texas’ congressional and legislative districts mentioned above, was\ncommenced before a three-judge court in 2011, just after the challenged plans were enacted, and\nno final order is yet in sight. By this measure, the last redistricting challenge in Alabama, which\nconsolidated separate claims brought bythe Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and the Alabama\nDemocratic Conference, was a model of judicial speed and took only five years to complete,\nrunning from October 10, 2012 (when a stay was lifted after the new legislative plans were\nprecleared by Attorney General Holder) until October 23, 2017 (when final judgment approving\nthe State’s remedial legislative districts was entered). See Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v.\nAlabama, No. 2:12-cv-691-WKW-MHT-WHP (docket sheet). The case included a trial, 989 F.\nSupp. 2d 1227 (M.D. Ala. 2013), an appeal before the Supreme Court, 135 S. Ct 1257 (2015), a\nremand, 231 F. Supp. 2d 1026 (M.D. Ala. 2017), and passage of remedial districts by the\nLegislature.\n16\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 17 of 24\nApril 5, 2018); E.E.O.C. v. Dressler Industries, Inc., 668 F.2d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.\n1982)(“Toapplylachesinaparticularcase,thecourtmustfindboththattheplaintiff\ndelayed inexcusably in bringing the suit and that this delay unduly prejudiced\ndefendants.”). These elements are easily established.\nFirst, Chestnut’s claimbecame available to her in June 2011 when Alabama’s\nnew congressional districts were enacted with only one majority-black district,\ndespite the fact that the 2010 Census established – she alleges – that two majority-\nblack districts could have been drawn, and that, she alleges, the Voting Rights Act\nrequired drawing two majority-black districts. Instead of challenging the new\ncongressional districts, she waited seven years to bring the very same challenge she\ncould have brought in 2011. Chestnut unquestionably delayed.\nSecond, Chestnut’s delay was clearly inexcusable. The information on which\nher claim necessarily is based – the 2010 Census results – became available in\nFebruary2011.Sincethentherehasbeennochangeinthosedata,orinotherrelevant\nfacts, or in the law that was necessary for her to bring her lawsuit. There was no\nimpediment to her bringing a § 2 vote dilution claim in 2011.\nThird, the State of Alabama would be unduly prejudiced by allowing\nChestnut’s claim to proceed. Assuming Chestnut were to prevail, and that a final\ndecision after appeals could be reached in 2019 or 2020 (an unlikely assumption),\nnew districts would be drawn on the basis of the 2010 Census, which would be at\n17\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 18 of 24\nleast nine or ten years out-of-date. It unduly prejudices the State, office-holders,\ncandidates, and voters to require the drawing of new districts using data no one\npretends portrays accurately the State’s present demographics. Also, the Census\nBureau estimates broad variances in how populations of Alabama counties have\nchanged since 2010. According to the Bureau’s most recent estimates, Mobile\nCounty’s population has barely changed (+0.2%)10, while neighboring Baldwin\nCounty’s increased by 16.7%, Lee County’s increased by 15.2%, and Conecuh\nCounty’s decreased by 5.2%, and all of these counties would likely be included in\nor impacted by Chestnut’s efforts to draw a second majority-black congressional\ndistrict. As this example shows, using outdated Census data to draw new districts\nwould violate one-person, one-vote and lay the basis for a separate counter-lawsuit\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn addition, Alabamians would be prejudiced if the Legislature were required\nto spend time and resources redistricting its Congressional seats for 2020, taking\nattention away from other important Legislative activities, only months before the\nLegislature must take up that task again after the 2020 Census. It would be senseless\nto do as Chestnut asks and require the Legislature to redistrict twice in such a short\nperiod of time. Following this reasoning, the court in MacGovern v. Connolly\n10 These 2018 Census Bureau figures are taken from U.S. Bureau QuickFacts: Alabama,\navailableat https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/al (last visitedOctober30, 2018).\n18\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 19 of 24\nrefused to order a redistricting where plaintiffs inexcusably delayed until the last\nmoment their challenge to Massachusetts’ legislative districts:\nEquity demands that a federal court stay its hand when judicial relief\nmakes no sense. This action, in which the remedy sought would come\nat great cost and yield results that are at best uncertain, and at worst,\nperverse, is plainly such a case. When the massive disruption to the\npolitical process of the Commonwealth is weighed against the harm to\nplaintiffs of suffering through one more election based on an allegedly\ninvalid redistricting scheme, equity requires that we deny relief.\nId., 637 F. Supp. 111, 116 (D. Mass. 1986).\nIn addition to population shifts within the State since 2010, Alabama is\nprojectedtoloseaCongressionalseatbasedonthe2020Censusbasedonpopulation\nchanges within and without the State.11 Were that to happen, the boundaries of new\ndistricts would vary significantly from any remedial districts that might result from\nthis litigation. A demonstration by Chestnut of the possibility of drawing two\nmajority-black districts with seven congressional seats using 2010 data would not\nestablish a precedent that two majority-black districts could be drawn using 2020\nCensus data, especially given the potential that there will only be six Congressional\ndistricts.\n11SeeBrianLyman,“IveyestablishesCensuscommittee;federalfunds,congressionalseatsonthe\nline,” Montgomery Advertiser (August 20, 2018), available at\nhttps://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/20/federal-funds-\ncongressional-seat-line-2020-census/1023841002/ (last visitedOctober30, 2018).\n19\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 20 of 24\nIn Fouts v. Harris, the court held that very similar facts were unduly\nprejudicial to the State of Florida. See 88 F. Supp. 2d 1351 (S.D. Fla. 1999).\nPlaintiffs in Fouts brought a challenge to Florida’s congressional districts in 1998.\nThe State of Florida asserted laches:\nDefendants assert that they are prejudiced by the Plaintiff’s delay in\nbringing this action because (1) over the six years [since the then-\nexisting congressional districts went into effect] and three election\ncycles votershave come to knowtheir districts and candidates,and will\nbe confused by change; and (2) requiring redistricting now, before the\n2000 census will result in two redistrictings within a two year period,\nwith resulting in voter confusion, instability, dislocation, and [a]\nfinancial and logistical burden on the state.\nId., 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354. Relying on a Fourth Circuit decision, the District Court\ndismissed the case on the basis of laches:\nThe dangers of such frequent redistrictings were the basis for the White\ncourt’sdecisiontoimposethedefenseoflaches.TheWhitecourtstated:\n[i]f we affirm the district court’s order, the Board will\nbe required to reapportion itself this year and it will\nprobablybe requiredtodoso againnext year,when the\nresultsofthe1990censusareavailable.Webelievethat\ntwo reapportionments within a short period of two\nyears would greatly prejudice the County and its\ncitizens by creating instability and dislocation in the\nelectoral system and by imposing great financial and\nlogistical burdens.\nWhite, 909 F.2d at 104 (emphasis added).\nMoreover, if the Court were to impose redistricting before the 2000\ncensus, such redistricting would necessarily be based on 1990 census\nfigures. Such old census figures have been recognized as unduly\nprejudicial because they fail to provide a basis for “fair and accurate\n20\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 21 of 24\nrepresentation for the citizens.” White, 909 F.2d at 104.\nTherefore, the defendants have established each of the three elements\nnecessary to assert the defense of laches. Accordingly, the motions to\ndismiss will be granted as to that issue.\nFouts, 88 F. Supp. 2d at 1354-1355 (quoting White v. Daniel, 909 F.2d 99 (4th Cir.\n1990)).\nFouts was cited approvingly by the Eleventh Circuit in another redistricting\ncase, Sanders v. Dooly County, Ga., 245 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir. 2001). The Sanders\ncomplaint attacked a joint county commission-board of education redistricting plan,\nbut as in this case, the Sanders plaintiffs had waited until two years before the next\nCensus to file their complaint. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s dismissal for laches of plaintiff’s claims for injunctive relief:\nThe district court granted the defendants summary judgment on laches\ngrounds. According to the court, the plaintiffs’ waiting until November\n1998 to file suit—over six years after the first use of the plan and five\nyears after Shaw v. Reno issued—was an inexcusable delay. This delay\nprejudiced the defendants and citizens of Dooly County, the court\nconcluded, in two principal ways: (1) redistricting late in the decade\nwouldleadtoback-to-backredistrictings(thecourt-orderedoneandthe\none using new census data) that would confuse voters and be\nunnecessarily costly to the County; and (2) the census data available to\nredistrict now are over ten years old and thus unreliable. The plaintiffs\nappeal.\n….\nTurning to the merits, we conclude that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in deeming the claims seeking injunctive relief to be\nlaches-barred for the reasons that we described above. Cf. Fouts v.\nHarris, 88 F. Supp. 2d 1351, 1353 (S.D.Fla.1999) (relying on similar\n21\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 22 of 24\nlaches reasoning to dismiss Shaw claims), aff’d sub nom. Chandler v.\nHarris, 529 U.S. 1084, 120 S.Ct. 1716, 146 L.Ed.2d 639 (2000).\nSanders, 245 F.3d at 1290-1291.\nHowever,theEleventhCircuitreachedadifferentconclusionontheplaintiffs’\nclaim for declaratory relief:\nBut we do think that the district court overstepped its discretion in\njudging the claims for declaratory relief to be similarly barred, because\nthethird element of a lachesdefense—prejudice to the defendants from\nthe unexcused delay—is missing. … None of the grounds for prejudice\nthat the district court relied on applies to the plaintiffs’ claims for a\ndeclaration that the 1992 plan violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nThere is no risk of confusion froma redistricting, obviously; no burden\nto the county to redistrict; and no use of out-of-date census data. An\neffect of a grant of such declaratory relief could be to prevent the\nAttorneyGeneralfromusingthe1993consent-decreeplanasabaseline\nfor retrogression analysis in the post–2000 census round of\npreclearance proceedings under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, but that\neffect is no more prejudicial to the defendants now than it would have\nbeen in 1993.\nId., 245 F.3d at 1291-2192 (footnotes omitted). This part of Sanders is\ndistinguishable. The specific benefit to plaintiffs that the Eleventh Circuit identified\n– resetting the benchmark for purposes of Section 5 review – is inapplicable to\nChestnut. And whether two majority-black districts could have been drawn in 2011\nsimply does not speak to whether two such districts will be drawable after the 2020\nCensus, particularly if Alabama loses a seat in Congress, leaving the state with only\nsix Representatives.\n22\n\nCase 2:18-cv-00907-KOB   Document 27   Filed 11/02/18   Page 23 of 24\nChestnut waited too late to bring her suit, and the State of Alabama would be\nundulyprejudiced if the Court were to overlook her inexcusable delayand allow her\ncase to go forward.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons shown above, Secretary Merrill respectfully moves the Court\nto:\na. dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction, or, if the Court declines to do so, then certify for\ninterlocutory appeal the issue of whether Chestnut’s § 2 challenge to\nthe State’s congressional districts must be heard bya three-judge court,\nand stayproceedings before this Court while the interlocutoryappeal is\npending;\nb. dismiss the amended complaint because Chestnut failed to state a\nclaim of vote dilution, or if the Court declines to do so, then certify for\ninterlocutory appeal the issue of whether Chestnut must satisfy\nGingles’ first threshold requirement in her complaint, and stay\nproceedingsbeforethisCourtwhiletheinterlocutoryappealispending,\nand\nc. dismiss the amended complaint because Chestnut inexcusably\ndelayed in commencing this case, and allowing it to proceed would\nunduly prejudice Defendant Secretary Merrill, the State of Alabama,\nmembers of the Legislature, candidates, and voters.\nRespectfully submitted this the 2nd day of November, 2018.\nSteve Marshall\nAttorney General\ns/ James W.
