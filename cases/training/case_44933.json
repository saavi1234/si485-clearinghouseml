Plaintiff alleged that due to the wide margin between popular votes received by Hillary Clinton and by President-Elect Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential election, the value of each Clinton vote counted as approximately 0.99 of each Trump vote. Plaintiff stated that under the Fifth Amendment, citizens have a fundamental right to have their votes counted equally. Plaintiff alleged that counting each Clinton vote as 0.99 is unfair and serves no legitimate government interest. Plaintiff further alleged that the Electoral College Members' declaration of a winner in accordance with the states' results violated Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment rights. Plaintiff also contended that the Electoral College Members&rsquo; anticipated action of declaring Trump the winner violates the <em>Baker v. Carr</em> rule of \"one person, one vote.\"</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff sought a judicial declaration that the Electoral College Members&rsquo; anticipated action will substantially, adversely, and irreparably injure Plaintiff and other Clinton voters. Plaintiff also sought a judicial declaration that the process followed by the Electoral College Members is irreconcilable with Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. Lastly, Plaintiff sought an order permanently enjoining the Electoral College Members from casting votes in a manner inconsistent with Hillary Clinton receiving more votes.</p>\r\n<p>On November 17, 2016, the Central District of California denied the Request to Proceed In Forma Pauperis due to an inadequate showing of indigency and because the case was legally or factually frivolous. The Central District dismissed the case.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2016, Plaintiff filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 16-56754).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal, which was granted two days later.&nbsp;</p>",

BIRKE is a resident of the State of California, and as such, cast a vote \n4  in the November 8, 2016 Presidential election for Democratic candidate Hillary \n5  Clinton. \n6    2.  Defendants, the 538 Individual Members of the Electoral College (the \n7  “E.C. Members”) are the electors chosen by the political parties of the popular vote \n8  winner of each state of the United States and the District of Columbia. The E.C. \n9  MEMBERS gather in their respective states on the first Monday following the second \n10  Wednesday of December after the Presidential election (December 19, 2016), in \n11  order to submit to the President of the Senate, Vice President Joseph Biden, their \n12  votes for the President and Vice-President of the United States. \n13  3.  Unless this Court issues the relief sought herein, the E.C. Members are \n14  overwhelmingly likely to cast their votes in such a manner as to violate the guaranty \n15  of BIRKE’s rights to equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment of the \n16  United States Constitution, see, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), and the \n17  fundamental principle of “one [person], one vote, enunciated by the United States \n18  Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962).  \n19   \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under Title \n22  28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction), § 2201 (authorizing declaratory \n23  relief), and § 2202 (authorizing injunctive relief).   \n24  5.  Venue is proper in this Court under Title 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n25   \n26  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n27  6.    BIRKE  hereby  incorporates  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \n28  Paragraphs 1 through 5 above, and incorporates them as though fully set forth here. \n \n \n2 \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:16-cv-08432-R-E     Document 1     Filed 11/14/16     Page 3 of 6   Page ID #:3\n \n1  7.  As of 7:00 a.m. P.S.T. November 13, 2016, according to the Associated \n2  Press (AP), Hillary Clinton received about 630,000 more votes in the Presidential \n3  election than President-Elect Donald Trump, out of approximately 121.2 million \n4  votes cast. There is no reasonable chance that Trump will surpass Clinton in the \n5  popular vote, or even narrow the present margin; according to election analysts, it \n6  is likely the margin for Clinton will grow as California and Washington complete \n7  their vote tabulations, and provisional ballots are tabulated. In fact, Clinton’s \n8  ultimate margin is widely expected to approach 2 million votes. \n9  8.  Notwithstanding this historic margin of votes in favor of the projected \n10  loser of the Presidential election, the E.C. MEMBERS are poised to award the \n11  Presidency to Trump on December 19th, because they will cast their votes according \n12  to the vote winner of each state and the District of Columbia. \n13  9.  Even taking Clinton’s vote margin over Trump according to AP, unless \n14  this  Court  issues  the  injunctive  relief  sought  herein,  the  E.C.  MEMBERS  will \n15  effectively cause a single vote for Clinton to be valued less than a single vote for \n16  Trump.  Calculating roughly based on the vote totals available to BIRKE at the time \n17  of this complaint, the value of each Clinton vote will count for only about .99 of \n18  each Trump vote. If Clinton’s margin expands as projected, that value will decrease \n19  to about .97. \n20  10.  The Fifth Amendment guarantees to all citizens the equal protection \n21  of federal laws, and is more explicitly protective against unfairness than the Due \n22  Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 \n23  U.S. 497, 499. Thus, the Fifth Amendment creates a fundamental right in each \n24  citizen and a corresponding obligation on the part of all government entities to \n25  treat federal election voters fairly. Counting each Clinton vote, including BIRKE’s \n26  Clinton vote, as only equal to approximately .99, that is, quantifiably less than each \n27  Trump vote, is fundamentally unfair, and serves no legitimate, let alone compelling \n28  government interest. Therefore, the action that the E.C. MEMBERS are all but \n \n \n3 \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:16-cv-08432-R-E     Document 1     Filed 11/14/16     Page 4 of 6   Page ID #:4\n \n1  certain to take on December 19, i.e., casting their votes only in accordance with \n2  the declared winner of the states each of the E.C. MEMBERS represents, violates \n3  BIRKE’s right under the Fifth Amendment to equal protection of the laws pertaining \n4  to his vote for President.  \n5  11.  In  addition,  the  E.C.  MEMBERS’  anticipated  action  violates  the \n6  fundamental, inviolate principle set forth by the United States Supreme Court in \n7  Baker  v.  Carr  369  U.S.  186,  of  “one  person,  one  [whole]  vote.”  There  is  no \n8  precedent supporting an election process that for all intents and purposes rests on \n9  a principle of “one person, .97-.99 vote.” \n10  12.  Injunctive relief is necessary because the process by which the E.C. \n11  MEMBERS will elect the President on December 19th is irreconcilable with BIRKE’s \n12  rights --– and those of approximately 63 million other Clinton voters -- under the \n13  Equal Protection Clause and Baker v. Carr. Either the procedural process set forth \n14  in the United States Constitution which the E.C. MEMBERS will follow, or BIRKE’s \n15  and millions of others’ fundamental rights can be vindicated by this Court under \n16  the United States Constitution, but both cannot be.    \n17  13.  BIRKE’s fundamental right to have his vote counted equally with a \n18  Trump voter’s supersedes the E.C. MEMBERS’ interests in following the Electoral \n19  College process, for the reasons set forth above in Paragraphs 9-12. The harm the \n20  E.C.  MEMBERS’  action  on  December  19th  will  cause  BIRKE  is  substantial  and \n21  irreparable,  and  BIRKE  lacks  any  adequate  remedy  in  law.  Accordingly,  an \n22  injunction prohibiting the E.C. MEMBERS from casting votes on December 19, 2016 \n23  is necessary and appropriate. \n24   \n25  DECLARATORY RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n26  14.  BIRKE  hereby  incorporates  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \n27  Paragraphs 1 through 13 above, and incorporates them as though fully set forth \n28  here. \n \n \n4 \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:16-cv-08432-R-E     Document 1     Filed 11/14/16     Page 5 of 6   Page ID #:5\n \n1  15.  An actual and substantial controversy now exists between BIRKE and \n2  the E.C. MEMBERS as to their respective rights and duties. BIRKE contends the \n3  process the E.C. MEMBERS will engage in on December 19, 2016 will irreparably \n4  injure BIRKE by infringing his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fifth \n5  Amendment by devaluing to less than one his vote for Clinton, while the E.C. \n6  MEMBERS  are  presently  believed  to  contend  they  should  cast  their  votes  on \n7  December 19th according to the popular vote winner of each of the states and the \n8  District of Columbia -- which will result in Trump’s being elected President. \n9  16. This dispute is presently justiciable because by all indications, the E.C. \n10  MEMBERS will vote on December 19th to make Donald Trump the 45th President \n11  despite his receiving about 1.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton, thereby \n12  causing substantial and cognizable injury to BIRKE. \n13  17.  The  E.C.  MEMBERS’  anticipated  action,  based  on  their  presumed \n14  contention in this matter, has substantially affected and will directly, substantially \n15  and adversely affect BIRKE. Therefore, a judicial determination of the parties’ \n16  respective rights and obligations as to this controversy is necessary and appropriate \n17  at this time. \n18   \n19  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20    Wherefore, BIRKE prays for judgment as follows: \n21    1.  For a judicial declaration that the E.C. MEMBERS’ anticipated action \n22  on December 19, 2016 will substantially, adversely, and irreparably injure BIRKE \n23  and all other Clinton voters, in violation of BIRKE’s rights under the Fifth \n24  Amendment, and will derogate the fundamental principle of one person, one \n25  vote. \n26    2.  For a judicial declaration that the process to be followed by the E.C. \n27  MEMBERS in electing the 45th President is irreconcilable with BIRKE’s rights to \n28 \n \n \n5 \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 2:16-cv-08432-R-E     Document 1     Filed 11/14/16     Page 6 of 6   Page ID #:6\n \n1  equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment, and will derogate the \n2  fundamental principle of one person, one vote. \n3    3.  For a judicial declaration that under longstanding principles of \n4  statutory and Constitutional construction, BIRKE’s rights supersede the interests \n5  of the E.C. MEMBERS in following the procedure for electing the 45th President. \n6    4.  For an order permanently enjoining the E.C. MEMBERS from casting \n7  votes for President on December 19th in a manner not consistent with Hillary \n8  Clinton’s receiving many, many more votes than Donald Trump, or otherwise \n9  performing their duties in such manner as effectively to diminish to less than one \n10  the value of BIRKE’S vote for Hillary Clinton. \n11    5.  For all such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n12   \n13  Dated:  November 14, 2016      Respectfully submitted, \n14   \n15           \n            _______________________ \n16 \n            John S.
