    "summary": "<p>On 20 May 2016, the Voting Rights Defense Project, the American Independent Party and two individuals in their capacity as eligible California voters brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against: the Secretary of State of California, the chief of Alameda County Registrar of Voters and the Director of the San Francisco Board of Elections, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the voting rights of no-party-preference (&ldquo;NPP&rdquo;) voters in the California presidential primary election of 7 June 2016. &nbsp;The plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint, which was filed later that day, alleged that voting information disseminated by the defendants inadequately informed NPP voters of their availability to obtain a crossover ballot in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. sections 10101(a)(2)(A) and (B); the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and under the California Elections Code Section 3000 <em>et seq</em>. &nbsp;Given that the defendants&rsquo; actions were alleged to violate state law, the plaintiffs also sought a mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C section 1361.&nbsp; &nbsp;The plaintiffs were represented by the Jaffe Law Firm and William Morris Simpich. &nbsp;The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James but reassigned to District Court Judge William H. Alsup on 23 May 2016. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under California law, an individual who declines to disclose a preference for a political party when registering to vote (a NPP voter), may nevertheless vote in a political party&rsquo;s primary if that political party adopted a rule permitting so-called &ldquo;crossover ballots.&rdquo; A crossover ballot is the only means by which an NPP voter can vote for a presidential nominee. The Democratic Party, the American Independent Party, and the Libertarian Party elected to permit such crossover ballots in the presidential primary of 7 June 2016. &nbsp;The last day to register to vote, or to re-register to vote to change parties or to become a NPP voter, was set for 23 May 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On the evening of 27 May 2016, one week after the action was filed and less than two weeks before the presidential primary, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and requested an expedited hearing on 1 June 2016, or on the soonest possible date prior to 7 June 2016 due to the immediate and irreparable harm alleged to be caused by the dissemination of incorrect, misleading and incomplete information to NPP voters on their right to vote in the presidential primary election. The wide ranging relief sought by the plaintiffs included a statewide injunction, informing the Secretary of State of California and all county officials to use email, internet, radio and TV to get a consistent and concise message out to remedy the alleged inaccurate information disseminated to NPP voters of their right to vote in the presidential primary and to notify poll workers and elections officials that NPP voters have the right to be informed that they may receive a presidential primary ballot, including an order for poll workers to ask NPP voters whether they wish to vote for a presidential candidate in any of the three crossover parties.</p>\r\n<p>On 31 May 2016, each of the defendants filed their opposition to the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. The defendants submitted that far from burdening the voting rights of Californians, they had gone to great lengths to inform voters of their rights so there had been no injury whatsoever. &nbsp;It was also submitted that the declarations filed in support of the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion were inadmissible and inaccurate legal opinions on the application of Californian state law but, in any event, the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim for a mandamus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1361 failed because the statute applied exclusively to violations of law by federal officials, not state or local officials. &nbsp;It was therefore requested that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California deny the motion for a preliminary injunction particularly in circumstances where the remedies sought by the plaintiffs were unwarranted and would sow confusion on the eve of the election on 7 June 2016.</p>\r\n<p>The hearing of the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction took place on 1 June 2016. &nbsp;For the reasons set out in the memorandum opinion of 2 June 2016, the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction was denied. &nbsp; It was held that the plaintiffs had failed to show any likelihood of success on their Voting Rights Act claims and no authority had been cited suggesting that the defendants&rsquo; conduct had been anything close to a constitutional violation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. &nbsp;Furthermore, the plaintiffs claim for a mandamus compelling the defendants to carry out alleged duties under state law also failed on the basis that 28 U.S.C section 1361 did not apply given that the defendants were all state and local officials. &nbsp;While the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California did not have jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the defendants based on a state law duty, the plaintiffs had failed to show that they could succeed on the merits. &nbsp;The plaintiffs&rsquo; theory of irreparable harm rested entirely on speculation as the defendants had already undertaken significant efforts to inform voters, particularly NPP voters, of their rights. In addition the plaintiffs&rsquo; delay in bringing the motion had left too little time for any relief, save for the relief sought at polling stations on election day. &nbsp;However, contrary to the plaintiffs&rsquo; belief, it was held that California state law (Section 13102(b) of the California Elections Code) did not require the defendants to affirmatively inform NPP voters of their rights to obtain a crossover ballot at polling stations. &nbsp;In consideration of the balance of equities and the public interest, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California held that the extraordinary relief sought by the plaintiffs was unwarranted and, to the extent that it was feasible at all, it would cause voter confusion by changing the rules in the run up to the presidential primary election of 7 June 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On 14 June 2016, one week after the primary election of 7 June 2016, the Secretary of State of California filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint without leave to amend. &nbsp;It was submitted that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which the relief should be granted and in any event as the primary had taken place on 7 June 2016, the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were now irrelevant. &nbsp;Nevertheless, as a matter of law, it was further submitted that the plaintiffs&rsquo; had failed to allege a violation of either the federal Constitution or the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs&rsquo; state law claims, which were said to be substantively without merit. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The chief of Alameda County Registrar of Voters filed a notice of joinder to the Secretary of State of California&rsquo;s motion to dismiss on 15 June 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On 20 June 2016, the Director of the San Francisco Board of Elections filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint for the reasons as articulated in the order of 2 June 2016 denying the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction. &nbsp;It was submitted that even if all of the allegations in the complaint were true, the lawsuit was moot, the plaintiffs lacked standing, and every cause of action failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. &nbsp;Accordingly, it was submitted that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California should grant the motion to dismiss without leave to amend.</p>\r\n<p>On 28 June 2016, the plaintiffs&rsquo; filed their opposition to the defendants&rsquo; motions for dismissal and sought permission to amend the complaint to ensure that the alleged discriminatory treatment of NPP voters would not be repeated in the 2020 primary election. The plaintiffs&rsquo; request for leave to amend sought to remove the cause of action seeking a writ of mandamus but to continue the allegations in respect of the violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 sections 10101(a)(2)(A) and (B); the California Elections Code section 3000 <em>et seq.</em>, and the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of Equal Protection pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed replies in support of their motions for dismissal on 5 July 2016. &nbsp;The Director of the San Francisco Board of Elections submitted that the plaintiffs had waived all arguments as regards standing and mootness of the case following the conclusion of the presidential primary on 7 June 2016 by failing to make any attempt to rebut those arguments. &nbsp;The Secretary of State of California submitted that the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for leave to file a further amended complaint merely recycled arguments and evidence that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California had already determined to be legally inadequate in the dismissal of the preliminary injunction. Accordingly, it was requested that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California should dismiss the complaint without leave to amend.</p>\r\n<p>On 26 August 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the action and granted judgment in favor of the defendants on the basis that the presidential primary had already occurred on 7 June 2016 and any proposed amendment to the complaint to address the 2020 presidential primary would be futile as it was not yet known if any political party would allow crossover ballots in the 2020 presidential primary, nor was it yet known whether the defendants would reinstate the practices complained of.</p>\r\n<p>On 26 September 2016, the Voting Rights Defense Project and the American Independent Party (the &ldquo;Appellants&rdquo;) appealed against the judgment of 26 August 2016 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (16-16717). &nbsp; On 13 April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the Appellants&rsquo; motion for voluntary dismissal and dismissed the appeal. &nbsp;The case is now closed.</p>",

For instance, Plaintiffs do not address the fact that this case is moot because the \n3  June 7, 2016 election has already occurred; that to the extent Plaintiffs ever had standing, they no \n4  longer do because Suzanne Bushnell and Clara Daims have voted in the Democratic presidential \n5  primary election; and that this case is not ripe for the 2020 election because there is no way to know \n6  now whether a political party will open its presidential primary to No Party Preference (“NPP”) voters, \n7  and even if a party did so, that the Department’s practices and procedures would be the same in four \n8  years as they were in June 2016.  In lieu of rebutting or even attempting to rebut those arguments, \n9  Plaintiffs recycle the same allegations that the Court has already rejected and the Department’s motion \n10  to dismiss has already refuted.  Indeed, much of Plaintiffs’ brief consists of paragraphs that have been \n11  copy-pasted verbatim from the Complaint and Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  The \n12  Court should dismiss this lawsuit without leave to amend. \n13 \nI.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE WAIVED ALL ARGUMENTS REGARDING STANDING AND \nMOOTNESS. \n14 \n15  A party’s failure to address an argument raised in a motion to dismiss constitutes a waiver of \n16  that issue.  See United States v. McEnry, 659 F.3d 893, 902 (9th Cir. 2011) (where an argument is \n17  available but not raised, it is waived); United States v. Cobb, No. 2:14-CR-00194-APG-NJ, 2015 WL \n18  518543, at *9 (D. Nev., Feb. 9, 2015); Hansen v. Long, 2014 WL 3435871, *14 (C.D. Cal., Jan. 28, \n19  2014) (failure to address argument is a concession that it is correct); In re Online DVD Rental Antitrust \n20  Litig., No. 09–2029 PJH, 2011 WL 5883772, at *12 (N.D. Cal., Nov. 23, 2011) (absent unusual \n21  circumstances, failure to respond to argument on merits “viewed as grounds for waiver or concession \n22  of the argument”); Qureshi v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., No. 09–4198, 2010 WL 841669, at *6 \n23  n. 2 (N.D. Cal., Mar. 10, 2010) (holding that the plaintiff abandoned claims by failing to address \n24  arguments against them in a motion to dismiss);  Sportscare of America, P.C. v. Multiplan, Inc., No. \n25  2:10–4414, 2011 WL 589955, at *1 (D.N.J., Feb. 10, 2011) (“In most circumstances, failure to \n26  respond in an opposition brief to an argument put forward in an opening brief constitutes waiver or \n27  abandonment in regard to the uncontested issue.”). \n28 \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  1 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  Plaintiffs have failed to respond to the Department’s arguments regarding the Complaint’s \n2  Article III deficiencies.  Specifically, Plaintiffs have not contested that: 1) they never had standing \n3  because their alleged confusion about the election does not constitute a cognizable injury; 2) to the \n4  extent Plaintiffs ever had standing, they no longer do because they voted in the Democratic \n5  presidential primary; and 3) this case is moot because the election has already occurred.  Docket No. \n6  51 at 8-9.  Indeed, the words “standing” and “moot” do not even appear in Plaintiffs’ brief, nor does \n7  “Article III.”  Because Plaintiffs have conceded that they have no standing and that this case is moot, \n8  the Court should dismiss it without leave to amend. \nII.  THIS CASE IS NOT RIPE FOR THE JUNE 2020 ELECTION. \n9 \n10  Plaintiffs argue that they should be allowed to amend their Complaint so that “the \n11  discriminatory treatment of the NPPs will [not] be repeated in 2020.”  Plaintiffs’ Opposition to \n12  Motions to Dismiss (“Opp.”) at 1.  For several reasons, this lone, conclusory statement does not make \n13  the case ripe.  First, there has been no “discriminatory treatment of the NPPs” for the reasons \n14  explained in the Department’s motion to dismiss, none of which Plaintiffs have even attempted to \n15  rebut in their opposition.  Docket No. 51 at 3-15. \n16  Second, even if there had been discriminatory treatment in June 2016, this case is not ripe to \n17  remedy a hypothetical harm in 2020.  “Ripeness prevents the court from deciding abstract or \n18  theoretical questions which have no concrete impact on the parties.”  State of California v. Federal \n19  Energy Reg. Comm’n, 966 F.2d 1541, 1562 (9th Cir. 1992); Jacobus v. Alaska, 338 F.3d 1095, 1104 \n20  (9th Cir. 2003) (requirement of ripeness ensures that issues are definite and concrete, not hypothetical \n21  or abstract); Watts v. Petrovsky, 757 F.2d 964 (8th Cir.1985) (speculative claim was not ripe for \n22  review); West v. Sec. of the Dept. of Transp., 206 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 2000) (courts avoid advisory \n23  opinions on abstract propositions of law).  Here, it is pure speculation whether, nearly four years from \n24  now, a political party will choose to allow NPP voters to vote in their primary.  California law allows \n25  political parties to make that determination before each primary election by providing “written notice . \n26  . . to the Secretary of State not later than the 135th day prior” to the election. See Cal. Elections Code § \n27  13102(c).  Even if it was possible to know now what political parties may do in four years, and even if \n28  the Department’s procedures before the June 7, 2016 election were discriminatory (which they were \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  2 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  not), it offends Article III to allow Plaintiffs to sue the Department now for practices and procedures \n2  that may or may not be implemented more than a thousand days from now. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE WAIVED THEIR CLAIM UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n3 \n4  Defendants’ motions to dismiss, as well as the Court’s Order denying Plaintiffs’ motion for \n5  preliminary injunction (Docket No. 46 (“Order”)), explained that the exclusive statute upon which \n6  Plaintiffs’ rely to seek a writ of mandamus—28 U.S.C. § 1361—is inapplicable to local officials.  \n7  Plaintiffs’ opposition makes no arguments to the contrary, and thus, Plaintiffs have waived all state \n8  law claims.   \n9  Despite this waiver, Plaintiffs persist in arguing that the Department has violated provisions of \n10  the Elections Code.  Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that Section 3006(c) obligated the Department to \n11  inform voters who have disclosed a preference for a qualified political party that that they have not \n12  “disclose[d] a preference for a qualified political party.”  Opp. at 3-4, 14.  Plaintiffs also claim that \n13  poll workers must be trained to inform NPP voters that they can vote in the primary of a party that has \n14  opened its primary to NPP voters.  Opp. at 8.  Plaintiffs further claim that the Department does not \n15  inform voters that they can hand-deliver vote-by-mail applications to the Department.  Opp. at 5.  Not \n16  only are these arguments meritless for the reasons set forth in Defendants’ motions to dismiss and the \n17  Court’s Order denying Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction,1 but there is no statutory basis in \n18  the Complaint or Plaintiffs’ opposition for vindicating any alleged violations of state law.     \n19 \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS’ VOTING RIGHTS ACT CLAIM UNDER SECTION 10101(a)(2)(A) \nFAILS. \n20 \n21  Plaintiffs make three arguments in support of their Voting Rights Act Subsection (A) claim.  \n22  Plaintiffs state, without any support, that “there is nothing in the statute that limits this cause of action \n23  to voter registration.”  Opp. at 12.  Plaintiffs do not cite—and the Department is not aware of—any \n24 \n                                                 \n25  1 Specifically, it is absurd to construe Elections Code Section 3006(c) as requiring registrars to \ninform voters who have disclosed a party preference that they have not disclosed a party preference.  \n26  Regarding the training of poll workers, this Court has already held that Elections Code § 13102(b) \ndoes not require poll workers to inform NPP voters that they can obtain a crossover ballot, but rather, \n27  that provision “contemplates that the voter would affirmatively request the crossover ballot.”  Order at \n5.  Finally, the Department informs voters that they can hand deliver vote-by-mail applications to the \n28  Department.  Docket No. 51 at 15.   \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  3 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  cases involving a Subsection (A) claim that does not relate to voter registration.  Indeed, the district \n2  court in Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F.Supp.2d 1356, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2004), held that Subsection (A) \n3  “was designed to eliminate practices that could encumber an individual’s ability to register to vote.”  \n4  (citing Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2003)).  Ironically, Plaintiffs’ own brief in \n5  support of their preliminary injunction motion states that Friedman “offers the best guidance in this \n6  situation.”  Docket No. 29 at 20.  Because “voter registration . . . is not at issue here,” Order at 4, the \n7  Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Subsection (A) claim. \n8  But even if Subsection (A) could be applied to contexts other than voter registration, Plaintiffs’ \n9  claim still fails.  Plaintiffs assert that, “The facts here illustrate a long series of intra-county and inter-\n10  county practices where some counties provide the necessary NPP information to NPP voters and some \n11  do not; some provide the requisite vote by mail information to all voters and some do not; and some \n12  poll workers provide the information needed to NPP voters and some do not. This is an elementary \n13  violation of the statute.”  Opp. at 12.  Regarding the supposed “inter-county practices,” what a \n14  registrar in a different county tells its voters bears no relevance to the information that the Department \n15  provided to San Francisco voters, or whether the Department complied with its legal obligations.   \n16  Regarding the supposedly differential treatment of NPP and party preference voters,   \n17  Subsection (A) does not require that every single voter be provided with identical information at the \n18  identical moment.  In Gonzalez v. State of Arizona, 2006 WL 3627297, at *8 (D. Ariz., Sept. 11, \n19  2006), an Arizona law required different types of identification depending on whether an individual is \n20  registering to vote or verifying identity on election day. Id. at *1.  The Court upheld the law, noting: \n21  “It is not a violation of subsection (A) for a state to apply different standards to two inherently \n22  different procedures.” Id. at *8.  Similarly, nothing in Subsection (A) requires the Department to \n23  inform voters who have disclosed a party preference that they have not disclosed a party preference.  \n24  Those voters are in an “inherently different” position from NPP voters, so they should not receive the \n25  same notice from the Department. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  4 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 6 of 8\n \nV.  PLAINTIFFS’ VOTING RIGHTS ACT CLAIM UNDER SECTION 10101(a)(2)(B) \n1  FAILS. \n2  Plaintiffs’ response as to why their Subsection (B) claim should survive is similarly flawed and \n3  inconsistent with the Court’s conclusion in its preliminary injunction Order.  Plaintiffs’ brief simply \n4  repeats verbatim the allegations in the Complaint, which are also identical to the arguments made in \n5  support of Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion.  Compare Docket No. 2 at ¶ 27 and Docket No. \n6  29 at 20 to Opp. at 13-14.  The only difference is that Plaintiffs now acknowledge that “case law is \n7  somewhat disfavorable based on the facts at hand,” and rely exclusively upon “the 9th circuit case, \n8  Churches.”  Opp. at 15.   \n9  In fact, the Ninth Circuit has not decided a Voting Rights Act case with “Churches” in the title, \n10  but a district court in Washington has.  In Washington Ass'n of Churches v. Reed, 492 F.Supp.2d 1264, \n11  1266 (W.D. Wash., Aug. 1, 2006), at issue was a state law that “essentially requires the state to match \n12  a potential voter’s name to either the Social Security Administration database or to the Department of \n13  Licensing database before allowing that person to register to vote.”  The district court found that the \n14  law likely violated Subsection (B) because the state “failed to demonstrate how an error or omission \n15  that prevents Washington State from matching an applicant’s information is material in determining \n16  whether that person is qualified to vote under Washington law.”  Id. at 1270.   \n17  The present case is nothing like Churches.  Unlike in Churches, the alleged “error or omission” \n18  alleged here—failing to tell voters who have disclosed a preference for a qualified political party that \n19  that they have not “disclose[d] a preference for a qualified political party,” see Cal. Elections Code § \n20  3006(c)—did not deny or otherwise affect anyone’s right to vote.  Indeed, the Department’s decision \n21  not to provide such a misleading notice to party preference voters was entirely appropriate because \n22  providing such information would only have confused them.  Further, unlike in Churches, the alleged \n23  “error or omission” did not occur on an “application, registration, or other act requisite to voting,” as \n24  people requesting crossover ballots have already registered to vote.   \nVI.  PLAINTIFFS’ CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS FAIL. \n25 \n26  Plaintiffs ignore all of the Department’s arguments as to why the Complaint’s constitutional \n27  claims are meritless.  In lieu of even acknowledging the existence of this portion of the Department’s \n28  brief or attempting to argue why the Court’s conclusions in its Order denying the preliminary \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  5 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 7 of 8\n \n1  injunction do not apply here, Plaintiffs have copy-pasted seven paragraphs from their Complaint and \n2  their preliminary injunction motion.  Compare Docket No. 2, ¶¶ 29-30 and Docket No. 29 at 20-23 \n3  with Opp. at 18-19.  By failing to address the Department’s arguments, Plaintiffs have waived any \n4  argument that their constitutional claims should not be dismissed.  Even without a waiver, Plaintiffs’ \n5  constitutional claims fail for the reasons articulated in the Court’s Order and the Department’s motion \n6  to dismiss.  Order at 3-4; Docket No. 51 at 11-13. \n7 \nVII.  THE COURT SHOULD REJECT PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST TO AMEND THEIR \nCOMPLAINT “TO CONFORM TO PROOF.”  \n8 \n9  Plaintiffs ask the Court to allow them to amend their Complaint to “conform to proof.”  This \n10  request lacks legal and factual basis.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) sets forth the \n11  circumstances under which the Court may allow a party to amend its complaint to conform to the \n12  evidence presented “during and after trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).  By its plain language, Rule 15(b) \n13  has no application where, as here, there has been no trial.   \n14  Even if Rule 15(b) had some applicability before trial, Plaintiffs’ request should be denied for \n15  multiple reasons.  First, the “proof” Plaintiffs rely upon does not support any of their claims.  That \n16  proof appears to consist mainly of two documents that the Court has already considered—the \n17  Department’s ballot replacement request form and a vote-by-mail application sent to VBM voters.  \n18  Opp. at 2-3, citing Exhibits 11-A and 11-B to the Dec. of James Roguski.  Neither of these documents \n19  is misleading or supports any alleged violation of law, for the reasons explained in the Department’s \n20  opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (Docket No. 33 at 10-13) and the \n21  Declaration of John Arntz in opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (Docket No. \n22  35 at ¶¶ 29-36).  Indeed, the Court has already rejected Plaintiffs’ arguments that these documents \n23  violate any of the laws cited in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  There is no reason to allow Plaintiffs to amend \n24  their Complaint to relitigate the same issues that the Court has already ruled on. \n25  Plaintiffs’ “proof” may also consist of allegations and articles about the conduct of registrars \n26  who have not been sued in this case; supposed discrepancies between how different counties’ \n27  registrars chose to provide information to voters; and supposed voters confusion in other counties.  \n28  Opp. at 5-9, 12, 13, 16, 18.  But none of these allegations or articles bear any relevance to whether the \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Reply iso Mot. to Dismiss  6 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01118139.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 57   Filed 07/05/16   Page 8 of 8\n \n1  Department complied with the law in informing San Francisco voters about the issues in this case.  \n2  And in any event, as the Court has already held, the fact that counties may have different approaches \n3  does not violate the law.  Order at 4 (“Voters must read the materials provided to them to understand \n4  their rights; only some counties will spoonfeed the information.

On for\n 5 motion for preliminary injunction.\n 6 Counsel, please state your appearances for the record.\n 7 MR. SIMPICH:  William Simpich and Stephen Jaffe here\n 8 for the Plaintiffs, Your Honor.\n 9 THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  Welcome.\n10 MS. O'GRADY:  Sharon O'Grady, Deputy Attorney General\n11 for Alex Padilla, Secretary of State.\n12 MR. LARA:  Ray Lara appearing on behalf of Tim\n13 Dupuis, Registrar of Voters for Alameda County.\n14 MR. WHITE:  Joshua White and Ron Flynn from the\n15 San Francisco City Attorney's office here for --\n16 THE COURT:  Welcome.  Welcome.  All right.  \n17 So you get to go first.  We don't have unlimited time.  So\n18 please make your best points.\n19 MR. SIMPICH:  Thank you, Your Honor.\n20 Your Honor, I wanted to start by mentioning a letter I got\n21 just last night from a poll worker.  And the gist of the\n22 letter was he was afraid that if he informed voters of their\n23 right to request a presidential ballot he might go to jail,\n24 get in legal trouble.  He wanted to know what to do.\n25 It kind of illustrates the nature of the problem with the\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 4 of 35\n     4\n 1 poll workers in particular.  And it also illustrates the\n 2 confusion among the poll workers and the voters regarding the\n 3 right path to have a smooth and easy and uniform and fair\n 4 election.\n 5 The Secretary of State I thought put it in bold relief on\n 6 Page 14 of her brief, meaning Ms. O'Grady's brief, but\n 7 Mr. Padilla's brief if you will, states that under 13102, the\n 8 Elections Code, the duty is only for the poll worker to wait\n 9 for the voter to request the presidential ballot.\n10 But the Secretary of State's training material focuses on\n11 the fact that the poll workers are expected to inform the\n12 voter of their right to request a presidential ballot.\n13 And so, the question is pretty clear (Indicating).  Who\n14 has the burden?  Does the voter have the burden to request the\n15 ballot?  Or does the poll worker have the burden to request\n16 the ballot?  And I think this is a case that shouts out for\n17 uniformity.\n18 It's a big question, I think.  I understand the Secretary\n19 of State -- we called that office primarily as an\n20 indispensable party, but at the same time, because of these\n21 training materials, it brings it into bold relief the question\n22 of duty to train in a uniform manner the elections boards\n23 around the state.\n24 THE COURT:  Why is that a federal issue?\n25 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, the federal issue, Your Honor, I\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 5 of 35\n     5\n 1 would offer, obviously the equal protection argument is one\n 2 that leaps out in terms of the county-by-county disparity.  We\n 3 have pointed out that other counties do things different ways.\n 4 San Francisco, for example, in terms of the poll worker\n 5 issue, we don't have a complaint with.  I have made that very\n 6 clear with Mr. White.\n 7 Alameda County, we do have a problem with the poll worker\n 8 issue.  And we have a couple poll workers ready to rebut, if\n 9 need be, today about what happened and happens at their\n10 trainings over the last couple weeks at these Alameda County\n11 trainings.  They say they're trained to not inform the voters\n12 of their right to request a presidential ballots.\n13 THE COURT:  Okay, but let's assume you are right on\n14 the facts, and just for the sake of argument, that in one\n15 county the poll workers inform -- what do you call, these\n16 NPPs?\n17 MR. SIMPICH:  \"No-party preference\" is the term of\n18 art, Your Honor, yes.\n19 THE COURT:  Okay, they get informed of their right to\n20 request a crossover ballot.  And another county, they're just\n21 silent.\n22 Where does it say in the Constitution that there's any --\n23 that even comes close to a constitutional issue?\n24 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, we offer, Your Honor --\n25 THE COURT:  Maybe a state-law issue, but you should\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 6 of 35\n     6\n 1 have brought that issue in state court.\n 2 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, believe me, Your Honor, we\n 3 thought about it, Your Honor.  We felt this was an issue where\n 4 strict scrutiny should be applied, because you have got a\n 5 class of individuals and no party preference voters in\n 6 particular, who are treated in a different way than the rest\n 7 of the voting populace.  These voters are not informed of what\n 8 a crossover ballot means, nor are they informed of their right\n 9 to vote for President.\n10 THE COURT:  But that is what your group does, is get\n11 the word out.  That is what -- people are presumed to know\n12 what the law is.  They don't have to have somebody inform them\n13 of the law.\n14 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, in this case, they're simply\n15 trying to find out what is inside their ballot packet.  They\n16 don't even know -- in many counties, for example, you have ten\n17 piles, Your Honor, of different packets.  Six parties, and\n18 then four different piles of no-party preference.  One for\n19 no-party preference that are just without a presidential\n20 ballot, and the other three have the presidential ballots of\n21 three parties.\n22 So you have ten parties -- ten different groups, totally.\n23 And if the voter is not informed of what they are asking for\n24 when they say they are no-party preference, in many cases they\n25 simply receive what I would call a vanilla no-party preference\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 7 of 35\n     7\n 1 that has no presidential party ballot within it.  And only if\n 2 they know that, to say they are not only no-party preference,\n 3 but also the party preference that they want to choose for\n 4 President, only then can they vote, because the presidential\n 5 ballot is on a separate document than the senatorial ballot\n 6 and the other federal ones.\n 7 THE COURT:  So let's take that -- say, somebody, NPP\n 8 goes and they get a ballot from the poll worker that doesn't\n 9 have the right President, and they say, \"I wanted to vote for\n10 Bernie Sanders,\" so they get back to the cardboard desk and\n11 say \"Give me the right ballot.\"\n12 They say, \"What are you talking about?\"\n13 Say, \"I want to vote for Bernie Sanders.\"\n14 \"Oh, you need a crossover ballot here.\"  Then they gave\n15 them the right one then.\n16 Isn't that the way it's going the work?\n17 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, Your Honor --\n18 THE COURT:  It's the way it would work where I vote.\n19 I vote in Alameda County.  I think that's what would happen if\n20 that scenario occurred.\n21 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, the problem is twofold,\n22 Your Honor.  One is that many people don't know what\n23 \"crossover ballot\" means, or that the NPP doesn't necessarily\n24 mean they will get a presidential ballot.\n25 But then the problem is redoubled because sometimes people\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 8 of 35\n     8\n 1 simply get the ballot, and they write in their candidate.  Or\n 2 they leave, or they're confused and they leave it blank.\n 3 And I think there is a high level of intimidation and\n 4 confusion when you have federal offices on that ballot that\n 5 they have been handed for senator, for example.\n 6 So what I'm saying, Your Honor, is this is what I call a\n 7 case of mass confusion.  The poll workers aren't acting in\n 8 uniformity; the voters don't know what is in the packet; the\n 9 election workers send out inconsistent information to the NPP\n10 voters throughout the state.  \n11 And it kind of culminated for me when I spoke to Mr. White\n12 from the City when we were trying to resolve this about a week\n13 and a half ago, two weeks ago, and he hands to me these\n14 ballot, well, I actually pointed out to him (Indicating) these\n15 200-page voting pamphlets that had just arrived on May 9th at\n16 my doorstep (Indicating).  I wasn't involved in any litigation\n17 until I started hearing about these problems after this went\n18 out.\n19 But in particular, he pointed out to me that these two\n20 documents are different.  One has no-party preference\n21 information on it for the no-party-preference voters, and the\n22 other does not.  And I pointed out to him:  What if somebody\n23 wants to become a no-party preference voter.  Shouldn't they\n24 have the right to understand what it would mean to be a\n25 no-party preference voter so that they can make a\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 9 of 35\n     9\n 1 discriminating choice?  And he thought that was confusing, and\n 2 I said, \"Well, you could, you know, have an orange box here\n 3 and green box here\" (Indicating).\n 4 But it's information that is mandated by law, Your Honor,\n 5 to be given to all the voters of the State of California.  And\n 6 this went out to hundreds of thousands of people without them\n 7 being notified that they could be no-party preference.\n 8 THE COURT:  I don't know if he -- it's certainly not\n 9 federal law.  That mandates anything.\n10 MR. SIMPICH:  Correct.  It is a state law,\n11 Your Honor.  And our principle that we are standing on is,\n12 one, equal protection because we do believe that no-party\n13 preference voters are not being treated in the same manner.\n14 They are being treated arbitrarily and with a much higher\n15 level of confusion, because a reasonable person, I would\n16 offer, Your Honor, has a very difficult time finding out what\n17 their rights are and is easily misled and can fall into error.\n18 THE COURT:  So on your pamphlets here --\n19 MR. SIMPICH:  These pamphlets here --\n20 THE COURT:  Does the NPP one explain about crossover?\n21 MR. SIMPICH:  The NPP one does explain about\n22 crossover, Your Honor.  My complaint here is a little bit\n23 different. What I'm saying is the people who are in parties\n24 like Democrat or Republican aren't informed that they have the\n25 right to become a no-party-preference voter, and still have\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 10 of 35\n    10\n 1 three different candidates that they could choose for\n 2 President.  And to me that's a fundamental right, Your Honor.\n 3 I think that these people who are not --\n 4 THE COURT:  But why would -- if somebody was a\n 5 Democrat and wanted to vote for Bernie Sanders, they could\n 6 already do that.\n 7 MR. SIMPICH:  That's correct.\n 8 THE COURT:  Well, why would they need to switch to\n 9 NPP to do that?\n10 MR. SIMPICH:  When they might not want to be a\n11 Democrat anymore.  They may be not in the line with the\n12 Democratic party anymore, and feel now they could take that\n13 step.\n14 Or they might want to vote for a Libertarian.  Maybe they\n15 have a strong feeling about the Libertarian, and now they can\n16 vote for a Libertarian instead of having to vote for the\n17 Democrat or the American Independent party.\n18 What I'm saying, Your Honor, is these options are open to\n19 voters.  And they are terrific options to have.  They are not\n20 empty choices.\n21 THE COURT:  All right, let me hear from the other\n22 side.\n23 MS. O'GRADY:  Your Honor, I'll speak to some of the\n24 overarching issues.\n25 (Reporter interruption) \n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 11 of 35\n    11\n 1 MS. O'GRADY:  There are many people that have been\n 2 working very hard to make this election successful, and, and\n 3 that it would go smoothly and be a positive experience for the\n 4 voter.\n 5 The secretary has worked very hard, including extensive\n 6 outreach, specifically targeted to NPP voters and people who\n 7 wants to change their voting registration, it's in the record\n 8 attached to Mr. Reyes' declaration, intended as an exhibit in\n 9 the attachments.  Websites, press releases, outreach events.\n10 A hotline.\n11 They have done -- they've gone the extra mile to try to\n12 make sure everyone in this important election knows their\n13 rights.  The office staff speaks directly to voters.  And the\n14 secretary actually spearheaded legislation to give more\n15 funding for counties to make sure that they had enough\n16 balance.\n17 So this is not a case where the people in charge are\n18 asleep at the switch.  People are working very hard.  The\n19 statute has a requirement that if a party -- if a non-NPP\n20 voter does not request a party ballot they are to be given by\n21 statute, the non-party ballot.  And the fact that voter\n22 outreach and polling people, maybe not entirely uniformly,\n23 maybe there's some that don't, but tell people about that\n24 affirmatively is great.\n25 But that's not what the statute requires.  And it's\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 12 of 35\n    12\n 1 certainly not a constitutional violation.\n 2 THE COURT:  Well, but Counsel said if Alameda County\n 3 does tell them, and San Francisco does not, or vice-versa,\n 4 that they're being -- that is a denial of equal protection of\n 5 the law.\n 6 MS. O'GRADY:  Your Honor, you could say that almost\n 7 every time someone opens their mouth.  I mean, if you really\n 8 wanted to make sure that no one had any additional information\n 9 that everyone else didn't have, people would go into polling\n10 places and just be given written documents, and said:  Figure\n11 it out for yourself.\n12 Interaction with voters is -- is common and a practice,\n13 and there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong\n14 with assisting voters.  And the information is widely\n15 available for anyone who wants it.  I can't speak to the\n16 individual counties; I would let them do that.\n17 THE COURT:  Let me ask you this.  If the -- take the\n18 scenario that I gave.  Let's say an NPP goes to a voting place\n19 and gets the NPP ballot.  Right?  Let's say that's right.\n20 They go into the little booth and say, \"Oh, wait I wanted to\n21 vote for Bernie Sanders.\"  And then they go back to the table\n22 and say \"You gave me the wrong one.  Where's Bernie on here?\"\n23 And then they say, \"Oh, you didn't ask for it, but do you\n24 want a Democrat...\"  Can that happen?  Or --\n25 MS. O'GRADY:  Yes, absolutely.  Election Code Section\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 13 of 35\n    13\n 1 13102(b) provides that if you, if -- and I believe all the\n 2 posting -- polling places, it's posted that says:  You have\n 3 the right to receive a new ballot if prior to casting your\n 4 ballot you believe you've made a mistake.\n 5 And every voter can get up to three ballots.  So, yes.  If\n 6 someone comes and says:  Oh, my God, I thought I was going to\n 7 be able to vote for President, I can't, of course they can go\n 8 back to the poll worker, and exchange that for the ballot that\n 9 they want.\n10 They would have to actually vote, not vote for President,\n11 cast their ballot, and leave before they would be in a\n12 position where they couldn't change their vote.  Or at least,\n13 they'd have to cast their ballot.  They'd have to put their\n14 ballot in the ballot box.\n15 So this is not a situation where people are going to be\n16 blindsided or trapped.  If someone wants to vote for Bernie\n17 Sanders and goes into a voting place and finds out he can't,\n18 he or she, all they have to do is raise that with the poll\n19 worker.\n20 THE COURT:  Is this correct, that -- I think it is\n21 correct, under our system here in California, a registered\n22 Democrat or registered Republican cannot cross over.\n23 MS. O'GRADY:  That's right.  They have to reregister\n24 to vote because every political party can decide who votes in\n25 their party.  The Democrats have decided that Democrats and\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 14 of 35\n    14\n 1 NPP voters can vote.  The Republicans, for example, have\n 2 decided that only Republicans can vote.  So if you are a\n 3 party-affiliated voter and you want to vote in another\n 4 political party, you do need to reregister in that party.\n 5 THE COURT:  What are the timelines on that?\n 6 MS. O'GRADY:  I believe the deadline for\n 7 reregistering is May 23rd.\n 8 MR. WHITE:  (Inaudible)\n 9 THE COURT:  What is today?  June 1?\n10 MR. LARA:  Yeah.\n11 THE COURT:  So that's already come and gone.\n12 MS. O'GRADY:  It's already come and gone.  The last\n13 day to vote by mail was yesterday.  The election is six days\n14 away.\n15 THE COURT:  Okay, let's hear from one of the other\n16 Defendants.\n17 MR. LARA:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Ray Lara appearing\n18 on behalf of Tim Dupuis.  And I'm going to be brief.  I just\n19 want to point out of a couple of things.  \n20 In the scenario that you presented, at the polls, where\n21 you mentioned if there's an NPP voter who gets a ballot and\n22 they want to get their Democratic ballot, they can do that.\n23 But even before any of that happens, what Alameda County\n24 has at each precinct is the flowchart that is in Tim Dupuis'\n25 declaration.  And that flowchart outlines who can vote for\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 15 of 35\n    15\n 1 what, and it outlines what the NPP voters can vote for.  And\n 2 there's more to the flowchart.\n 3 At the bottom of the flowchart, it expressly, explicitly\n 4 advises the poll worker to advise the NPP voter of his or her\n 5 crossover options.  And it goes even further.  In bold red\n 6 lettering, it gives a verbatim statement of what they should\n 7 say.\n 8 So I think it's kind of hard to imagine somebody getting\n 9 to that point and not knowing that they have the right to\n10 crossover vote if they are an NPP voter.\n11 And one other thing is that sheet is placed before the\n12 poll worker who is in charge of the roster index.  And that's\n13 right before you get the ballot.\n14 So you have to go in, check in, and then you go to the\n15 roster index, you find your name, and it shows what party you\n16 are registered with or if you're NPP.  And then you sign your\n17 name.  And right there, that roster index poll worker then\n18 gives the advice.\n19 THE COURT:  What happens -- I'm just curious.  Let's\n20 say that an NPP voter gets the NPP ballot, goes in there and\n21 doesn't say anything, but gets confused, and writes in \"Bernie\n22 Sanders.\"  \n23 What happens to that write-in vote?  Does that get counted\n24 or is it ignored?\n25 MR. LARA:  I don't believe write-in votes are\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 16 of 35\n    16\n 1 counted.  \n 2 THE COURT:  So that vote would be lost.  Right?\n 3 MR. LARA:  You know, I don't know if write-ins are\n 4 counted.  If they're not counted, it would be lost; if they\n 5 are counted, it would not be lost, is the short answer to\n 6 that.\n 7 THE COURT:  That's a non-answer.\n 8 MR. LARA:  Okay.\n 9 THE COURT:  All right.\n10 MR. LARA:  Also, as far as the relief that they\n11 request on poll worker training, I'm not sure exactly what the\n12 Court could order at this point.  \n13 We have over 4,000 poll workers.  There have been 300\n14 training sessions.  With six days left to the election, it\n15 would be impossible to really retrain all of those poll\n16 workers at this point.\n17 If they're asking for some type of notice, as I pointed\n18 out there is that notice.  We already have that in place.\n19 That's where -- the roster index poll worker.  \n20 And the Secretary of State has sent out a sign that\n21 advises all NPP voters of their right to vote in the AIP,\n22 Democratic or Libertarian presidential primary.  And that has\n23 to be posted at every precinct.\n24 And also, one other thing I wanted to touch on was in\n25 Alameda County all of our voter pamphlets or sample ballots\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 17 of 35\n    17\n 1 are the same, whether you're AIP, Libertarian, Democrat or\n 2 NPP.  And they all contain the page that's in Mr. Dupuis'\n 3 declaration that advises all NPP voters of their right to\n 4 crossover vote.\n 5 If you go home tonight and look at your voter pamphlet,\n 6 you will see it.  I think it is Page 3 of the sample or voter\n 7 information pamphlet.\n 8 THE COURT:  Okay, let's hear --\n 9 MR. LARA:  One final thing?  It came to my attention\n10 that there was a declaration filed today by Plaintiffs.  I\n11 haven't had a chance to really review it.\n12 I would move to strike, or at least ask the Court not to\n13 consider it for this motion.\n14 THE COURT:  All right, thank you.\n15 MR. LARA:  Thank you.\n16 THE COURT:  Let's hear from San Francisco.\n17 MR. WHITE:  Thank you, Your Honor.\n18 First of all, on the poll worker issue --\n19 THE COURT:  Your name is?\n20 MR. WHITE:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Joshua White on behalf of\n21 Defendant John Arntz.\n22 On the poll worker issue, the evidence is undisputed even\n23 by Plaintiffs' counsel, that all poll workers are trained to\n24 actively inform NPP voters that they may vote in one of the\n25 presidential primaries.  That's stated in John Arntz's\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 18 of 35\n    18\n 1 declaration.  It's also stated in the poll worker training\n 2 manual on Pages 37 to 50, which is a declaration exhibit to\n 3 John Arntz.  There's also a sign in every polling place\n 4 informing NPP voters that they can obtain a crossover ballot.\n 5 On this question of whether the voter information\n 6 pamphlet -- the back page, the back cover of the voter\n 7 information pamphlet violates the equal protection clause, it\n 8 simply doesn't.  As we explained in our brief, the analysis\n 9 under Burdick is:  Is there a substantial burden on voting\n10 rights?  And if the answer to that question is no, then\n11 essentially it's a rational-basis analysis.\n12 Here, there's no evidence of any kind of burden on voting\n13 rights.  To the contrary, the Department, as we described, has\n14 gone to great lengths to inform NPP voters which presidential\n15 primary they can vote in, which voters could select a party,\n16 which -- how to change.  And there's just simply no evidence\n17 that any voters' rights have been burdened.\n18 In fact, the declarations submitted by Plaintiff actually\n19 speak to the effectiveness of the department's efforts.  Ms.\n20 -- Ms. Daims is an NPP voter who will be voting in a polling\n21 place.  She will be informed, as I just mentioned, that she\n22 can obtain a crossover ballot.  Ms. Mena received the\n23 department's mailer, submitted it to the Department, and\n24 obtained a cross-over ballot.  So I think there's just simply\n25 no evidence that any voter's rights have been burdened.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 19 of 35\n    19\n 1 You know, sort of the final point, this question about\n 2 whether the disclosure on the back of the voter information\n 3 pamphlet had to be provided to both NPP and non-NPP voters.\n 4 First of all, that is not a constitutional question.  It's a\n 5 question under state law.  \n 6 And even if the Court had jurisdiction under 1361, which\n 7 it doesn't, the argument the Plaintiffs' counsel is making\n 8 which is that that statement which says \"I have declined to\n 9 disclose a party preference,\" it would make no sense for the\n10 legislature to have instructed registrars to inform people who\n11 have disclosed a party preference to receive a statement that\n12 they have not disclosed a party preference.\n13 If the goal --\n14 THE COURT:  Say that again.  I followed you until the\n15 last sentence.\n16 MR. WHITE:  Sure.  So 3006(c) of the Elections Code\n17 indicates that on a vote-by-mail application, NPP voters have\n18 to receive a statement that says \"I have declined to disclose\n19 a party preference, but for this election, I will vote in one\n20 of the three parties that's opened up their primary.\"\n21 It makes no sense to interpret that provision to read that\n22 people who have disclosed a party preference -- so Democrats,\n23 Republicans, et cetera -- to receive a statement that says \"I\n24 have not disclosed a party preference.\"  That would, I think,\n25 create chaos.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 20 of 35\n    20\n 1 What the Department has --\n 2 THE COURT:  Well, I mean, let's say, take Democrat,\n 3 or let's say Republican.  That's really the only one that\n 4 would matter here.\n 5 So a Republican is sitting there, they open their mail,\n 6 and it says what?\n 7 MR. WHITE:  It doesn't say -- so on the back --\n 8 THE COURT:  I know, but what the Plaintiffs would\n 9 want it to say.\n10 MR. WHITE:  \"I have declined to disclose a party\n11 preference.  However, for the purposes of this primary, I\n12 would like to vote Democrat, AIP or Libertarian.\"  That is the\n13 interpretation.\n14 THE COURT:  But why would a Republican get that?\n15 MR. WHITE:  They would not.  That is exactly the\n16 point.\n17 The interpretation that Plaintiffs' counsel is advocating\n18 for is that a Republican would receive a statement saying \"I\n19 have declined to disclose a party preference.\"  It's a\n20 nonsensical interpretation of the statute, in our view.\n21 THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.\n22 Let me ask the Plaintiffs a question.  Here we are, on\n23 June 1.  You didn't even file this lawsuit until May 20.  You\n24 didn't ask for any kind of relief on an emergency basis until\n25 May 27th, seven days later.  So we set it up for as fast as we\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 21 of 35\n    21\n 1 could possibly set up a hearing.\n 2 MR. SIMPICH:  (Nods head)\n 3 THE COURT:  Now, give me one example of some relief\n 4 that would be practical that a judge could issue between now\n 5 and the election day that could actually be done.  I frankly\n 6 don't see anything, but maybe you have a better idea.\n 7 MR. SIMPICH:  What we're suggesting, Your Honor, is\n 8 something on one piece of paper (Indicating).  Something very\n 9 small, with four or five bullet points on it.  And we offered\n10 an example in the order we were suggesting at the beginning of\n11 our motion.\n12 The bullet points would be letting voters know that they\n13 -- on the NPP side they have a right to a presidential ballot.\n14 They have a right to obtain it at the polls.\n15 There's several other points --\n16 THE COURT:  This would be mailed out?\n17 MR. SIMPICH:  This would be e-mail, internet, social\n18 media, radio, TV.  Very simple bullet points, with one\n19 sentence, a few words, in each.\n20 The problem with these hundred-page documents is the\n21 fire-hose problem I mentioned in my brief, Your Honor.  It's\n22 too much for most people to wade through.  They simply put it\n23 aside and don't read it at all.\n24 If it was simple and uniform, voters, for example, if they\n25 were voting by mail and then changed their mind and decided to\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 22 of 35\n    22\n 1 go to the polls, they would know the surrender rule, which\n 2 means that you have got to bring your ballot, your\n 3 vote-by-mail ballot to the polls and exchange it, surrender it\n 4 for a new one.  Otherwise, you will be forced to vote\n 5 provisionally.  And a lot of people are upset about voting\n 6 provisionally, and it raises a big stink at the lines.  It's a\n 7 big problem.\n 8 Another big issue for many people is simply knowing if\n 9 their vote-by-mail -- the polls are open now.  Many people\n10 don't know the polls are open.  There is no way of knowing\n11 that.\n12 THE COURT:  What do you mean, the polls are open\n13 right now?\n14 MR. SIMPICH:  Yes, Your Honor.\n15 THE COURT:  You mean I could go vote now in Alameda?\n16 I thought it was only on election day.\n17 MR. SIMPICH:  No, they've been open since May 9th.\n18 THE COURT:  Okay.\n19 MR. SIMPICH:  At least in San Francisco.  I can't\n20 speak for Alameda, but there's a long period of time they are\n21 open.  And they are empty.  I went down on May 18th, and it is\n22 a very sad sight.\n23 THE COURT:  Why doesn't your group get on the radio\n24 and do all that yourself?\n25 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, we have.  But the point is a\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 23 of 35\n    23\n 1 little different, Your Honor.  The early voting things is\n 2 maybe not the best example, because that's not a violation\n 3 they've committed.  But it is a remedy that could be obtained\n 4 by simply letting people know the polls are open.\n 5 I'm trying to think of a very discrete remedy.  And the\n 6 important things for us is that NPP voters know that they have\n 7 the ability and right to vote for President.  And they have to\n 8 ask for the ballot.  Because otherwise, they may not be told,\n 9 as the Secretary of State has said (Indicating), they have a\n10 procedure where they claim the law is that they don't hand out\n11 the presidential ballot unless -- to an NPP voter unless they\n12 ask for it.\n13 So these are very fundamental rights that could be said in\n14 one sentence.  And this is the kind of relief that we think is\n15 central.  And the one sentence the poll workers need at their\n16 site, we would say, is \"All poll workers shall inform the\n17 voter they have the right to request a presidential ballot if\n18 they're NPP.\"\n19 Because if they're not NPP, they get a presidential\n20 ballot.  There is no need to ask.  But if it's an NPP voter,\n21 they will not get a presidential ballot unless they ask for it\n22 in many of the counties of this state.\n23 San Francisco's an exception.  San Francisco informs\n24 everyone that they have the right to request a presidential\n25 ballot.  We have no disagreement with San Francisco here.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 24 of 35\n    24\n 1 THE COURT:  But every NPP would have the right to ask\n 2 for it, even in a county where they don't inform them.  Right?\n 3 MR. SIMPICH:  Right.  If they know that right.  And\n 4 this is an informational right that we contend can't -- if --\n 5 if it's one way, it's got to be the same way throughout the\n 6 state.  It's a violation of equal protection and, we contend,\n 7 the Voting Rights Act.\n 8 THE COURT:  You don't have a single decision in the\n 9 history of the entire universe that says that.  That is just\n10 you talking.\n11 That is just hot air.  There's not a single decision that\n12 says that violates equal protection.\n13 MR. SIMPICH:  Your Honor, there's Yick versus Wo\n14 (sic) and various other cases about arbitrary discrimination.\n15 Arbitrary discrimination is a fine area of law that's got long\n16 standing.  All facts are different.  I would agree with the\n17 Court.\n18 THE COURT:  That case doesn't come anywhere close to\n19 this.\n20 MR. SIMPICH:  All I'm saying, Your Honor, is simply\n21 that it's not just the issue of equal protection we're\n22 arguing.  We're also arguing that they are looking at the\n23 eligibility of these individuals.  They're asking for their\n24 name and address.  They're asking if they're vote-by-mail or\n25 not vote-by-mail.  They're finding out if they're NPP.  So\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 25 of 35\n    25\n 1 eligibility is at issue.\n 2 And under Section A of the Voting Rights Act we've cited\n 3 within Section 2, we think that the standard and procedure and\n 4 practice needs to be uniform.  And we think it's a basic\n 5 right.  We think it's even more closely on point than equal\n 6 protection.\n 7 All facts are different; I would agree with the Court on\n 8 that.  But this is a unique situation brought about by this\n 9 no-party-preference status, where the ballot is separated from\n10 the other ballot, and it's not automatically given to the\n11 voter.\n12 THE COURT:  All right.  Everyone done?\n13 MS. O'GRADY:  Your Honor, if I could have a minute?\n14 Uh, among -- there are very voluminous voting materials,\n15 but there are also very clear one-page directives to voters\n16 (Indicating) that make very clear their options.\n17 Mandatory injunction is an extreme remedy, especially\n18 against state officials, that would require a very high\n19 showing.  And I don't believe there's been a showing of any\n20 violation of federal or state law.\n21 THE COURT:  All right.  Anyone else?\n22 MR. LARA:  Your Honor, just briefly, I would concur\n23 with that.  And I do want to emphasize that Alameda County\n24 does inform poll workers to inform NPP voters of their right\n25 to cross-vote.  And more importantly, we already provide that\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 26 of 35\n    26\n 1 flowchart to the poll workers at the polls.  Which is exactly\n 2 what they want.\n 3 MR. SIMPICH:  Your Honor, I have one last exhibit\n 4 (Indicating) I just wanted to bring to the Court's attention.\n 5 THE COURT:  Okay.\n 6 MR. SIMPICH:  This (Indicating) is not an application\n 7 to vote by mail, but it led to an application to vote by mail.\n 8 MR. LARA:  Can we see that?\n 9 MR. SIMPICH:  Yes.  This is Exhibit 11A.  City and\n10 County of San Francisco.\n11 (Exhibit is tendered to opposing counsel and others) \n12 MR. SIMPICH:  And this is --\n13 THE COURT:  You've got to show it to me.  It won't do\n14 any good to talk about it.  Who's got it?\n15 MR. SIMPICH:  Thank you.\n16 THE COURT:  All right.  My law clerk is giving it to\n17 me, I've got it.  Okay.\n18 (Document handed up to the Court) \n19 MR. SIMPICH:  Thank you.\n20 THE COURT:  What is the point?\n21 MR. SIMPICH:  The point, Your Honor, is on the\n22 paragraph below the three parties that are named -- because\n23 they do name the parties in this particular document.  This is\n24 a very short document (Indicating).  This is not a\n25 hundred-page fire-hose type document.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 27 of 35\n    27\n 1 This simply states that (As read):  \n 2 \"To request a ballot that includes the presidential \n 3 primary contest of one of these parties, mark the \n 4 name of the party on the attached postage-paid \n 5 postcard and sign and return the postcard no later \n 6 than April 18th.  If you do not request the ballot of \n 7 one of these parties, your ballot will not include a \n 8 contest for President.\" \n 9 And this, Your Honor, I know why they did it.  They did it\n10 so they could get the ballot to the voter a month before the\n11 election.  But to the reasonable reader, it sounds like after\n12 April 18th, they will no longer be able to vote for President\n13 of the United States, if they are a no-party preference voter.\n14 THE COURT:  But doesn't this relate to doing it by\n15 mail?\n16 MR. SIMPICH:  Well, it does, in one sense,\n17 Your Honor.  But my immediate point here -- I had two points.\n18 My first point was that here (Indicating), what it means is\n19 that the voter doesn't -- believes he's missed his deadline or\n20 her deadline, and can no longer vote for President of the\n21 United States.\n22 My second point is that there was a postcard attached to\n23 this -- again, very short document, half a page, like this\n24 other one (Indicating).  And this one says: If you want a\n25 replacement ballot, get to us by June 1st.  \n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 28 of 35\n    28\n 1 But it also adds that (As read):\n 2 \"I request a vote-by-mail ballot of one of these \n 3 three parties.\" \n 4 So, now, another situation was created where an\n 5 application to vote by mail, which is what this is\n 6 (Indicating) -- Mr. White doesn't agree with me on that, but\n 7 this other document, 11B, is an application to vote by mail,\n 8 by anyone's standards.  And it gives the wrong date of June\n 9 1st.\n10 These are two fundamental mistakes on half-pages of paper\n11 that went to hundreds of thousands of people within the last\n12 two months before the election.  These are fundamental errors.\n13 We don't need to parade a lot of witnesses in here.  It shouts\n14 out for very straightforward and simple relief.\n15 THE COURT:  Can't these people still go to the polls\n16 and vote?\n17 MR. SIMPICH:  If they know enough; if they haven't\n18 been disheartened.  My friend Ms. Mena, who is trying to get\n19 inside, she was so frightened by getting this (Indicating)\n20 that she went and tried to change her registration to\n21 Democrat.  And if she had brought her photo ID, she'd be up\n22 here right now saying \"Please let me testify because I'm still\n23 thinking that I -- no-party preference, I'm thinking I'm\n24 Democrat,\" and they're telling her she's no-party preference.\n25 She doesn't even know what party she's in.  To this day.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 29 of 35\n    29\n 1 And I think that the intake worker was confused when she\n 2 tried to change to Democrat and put her down as a NPP\n 3 Democrat, because that means that she will get the Democratic\n 4 ballot but remain no-party preference.  She was trying to go\n 5 all the way Democrat so she wouldn't have any problems of any\n 6 kind.\n 7 Thank you.\n 8 THE COURT:  Go ahead.\n 9 MR. WHITE:  Very brief, Your Honor, just to respond.  \n10 So first, to the extent these are state-law claims,\n11 there's no jurisdiction under 1361.  Again, it sounds like if\n12 Mr. Simpich is making an equal protection argument, we've come\n13 back to the standard of:  Has there been a substantial burden\n14 on any voter?\n15 The answer is:  There's been no burden, whatsoever.\n16 What's the -- and then the next question is:  Is it\n17 rational?  Was this a rational basis to, you know to, send\n18 this form to vote-by-mail voters?  The answer is yes, for the\n19 reason we explained in our brief.\n20 There's an operational reason why voters have to be\n21 encouraged to get their -- to get their requests for an NPP\n22 ballot in early.  The reason is if they don't get them in\n23 early, then there is a risk that the vendor will not have\n24 enough time to actually create the ballot at all.  \n25 Regarding this June 1st issue, I would just direct the\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 30 of 35\n    30\n 1 Court to actually read the document that Mr. Simpich is\n 2 referring to.  June 1st is the date by which people who want\n 3 to request a replacement ballot may do so.\n 4 The reason for that request is that if the Department\n 5 received a request for a replacement ballot on June 3rd or\n 6 June 4th, there wouldn't be time to get the voter his or her\n 7 ballot in time for the voter to cast --\n 8 THE COURT:  Is that from voting by mail?\n 9 MR. WHITE:  Yes.  So a voter who has already\n10 registered to vote by mail, and let's say, for example, a\n11 voter, you have an NPP voter who is registered to vote by\n12 mail, that voter, let's say, got their -- didn't send in their\n13 form by April 18th.  The ballot they would receive would not\n14 include a presidential primary because they hadn't requested a\n15 crossover ballot.\n16 In the ballot envelope would be the voting instruction\n17 guide which is attached as Exhibit B to the dec of Director\n18 Arntz.  And they would be told:  If you are an NPP voter and\n19 you want to obtain a replacement ballot, here is the form you\n20 have to fill out, and you must fill it out by June 1st so we\n21 can get you a replacement ballot.\n22 And that process worked, even for Ms. Mena.  She sent in\n23 her form; she received a crossover ballot.  So there's no\n24 evidence that this has imposed any burden.\n25 And finally, on the question of issuing some sort of\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 31 of 35\n    31\n 1 public service announcement, not only have all of the -- have\n 2 Plaintiffs failed to meet any of the standards, but it's\n 3 entirely unnecessary.  The Department has already been\n 4 notifying the public in multiple ways about the option of\n 5 obtaining an NPP ballot.  \n 6 When they show up at the polls, they'll get an NPP ballot.\n 7 And if they vote by mail, the deadline has already passed\n 8 yesterday.  So it would be entirely unnecessary.\n 9 Thank you, Your Honor.\n10 MR. SIMPICH:  Could I have a final word, Your Honor?\n11 THE COURT:  All right.\n12 MR. SIMPICH:  Thank you.\n13 I just wanted to point out a citation that was provided by\n14 Alameda County.  And their citation was that (As read): \n15 \"Burdens that require strict scrutiny are laws and \n16 regulations that unreasonably deprive some residents \n17 from voting in an election or dilute the voting power \n18 of some voters.\"   \n19 And that is Lemons versus Bradbury, 538 F.3d 1098, 1104,\n20 Ninth Circuit, 2008.\n21 And again, Your Honor, the NPP voters' voting power is\n22 being diluted.  They are 23 percent of the populace.  And it's\n23 very clear, Your Honor, I would offer that these laws and regs\n24 that we're pointing out to the Court are depriving them from\n25 voting in a meaningful fashion; are going to create\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 32 of 35\n    32\n 1 extraordinarily long lines to voters who have done their\n 2 homework.  And the poll workers are in a state of fear,\n 3 because they don't know what information they can give.  It\n 4 varies within counties and from county to county.\n 5 We think the eligibility issue is relevant regarding the\n 6 Voting Rights Act.  And the equal-protection argument I think\n 7 for NPP voters is unique, but fits here.\n 8 Thank you.\n 9 THE COURT:  Thank you.  All right.  Normally I would\n10 take this under submission and in a couple of weeks I would\n11 get an order out.  But since the election is coming up soon, I\n12 don't have that luxury, and I'm just going to give you the\n13 answer right now.\n14 All relief is denied on preliminary injunction.  Here are\n15 the basic reasons:  Plaintiffs waited way too long before\n16 bringing this lawsuit, and waited way too long before asking\n17 for a preliminary injunction.  So that, alone, is\n18 show-stopper, period.\n19 But there is more to it than that.  Almost all of these\n20 claims are state-law claims.  This is a Federal Court.  We\n21 also have state courts.  Most of this case should have been\n22 brought in state court, because that's the set of judges that\n23 know the state election code.  And federal judges are not up\n24 to speed on it, but we don't have jurisdiction over that\n25 anyway.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 33 of 35\n    33\n 1 Now, it is said by Plaintiffs, do have jurisdiction under\n 2 Section 1361 of Title 28 U.S. Code.  That's totally wrong.  I\n 3 reject that, reject that basis for saying that I have\n 4 jurisdiction to enforce state law.\n 5 With respect to the federal claims, the Court would have\n 6 jurisdiction, but there's absolutely no showing of any federal\n 7 violation, either under the equal protection clause or under\n 8 the Voting Rights Act.\n 9 And the mere fact that more information might be available\n10 in one county versus the other, you could get down to who's\n11 got enough money in the budget to put radio ads on.  That's\n12 not -- does not rise to the level of an equal protection\n13 violation.\n14 The citizens of California are smart enough to know what\n15 their rights are.  And they are smart enough to be able to go\n16 into a polling place and say \"I'm an NPP, and I want to do a\n17 crossover ballot.\"  They should know their own rights.  They\n18 should know what their rights are.  And if they do, they are\n19 going to be properly served.  And we don't need to\n20 over-educate them with public service announcements, are going\n21 on anyway.\n22 So I'm giving you this answer so that you will be able to\n23 take your emergency writs to the Court of Appeals for the\n24 Ninth Circuit, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court.  And\n25 perhaps after that, to the International Court of the Hague.\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 34 of 35\n    34\n 1 And -- but we are done at the District Court for now.\n 2 If time permits, I'll get out a memorandum opinion.  But\n 3 this order on the record of the Court will constitute the\n 4 denial of the motion for preliminary injunction.\n 5 Thanks to everyone.  Have a good day.\n 6 (Proceedings concluded) \n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n       \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 61   Filed 08/02/16   Page 35 of 35\n 1  \n 2  \n 3  \n 4 CERTIFICATE OF REPORTER \n 5          I, BELLE BALL, Official Reporter for the United \n 6 States Court, Northern District of California, hereby certify \n 7 that the foregoing is a correct transcript from the record of \n 8 proceedings in the above-entitled matter.  \n 9  \n10 /s/  Belle Ball____________________ \n11  Tuesday, August 2, 2016 \n12 Belle Ball, CSR 8785, CRR, RDR \n13  \n14  \n15  \n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25",

Federal courts recognize the right to join in \n7 \nmotions filed by other parties. See, e.g., Willis v. Pacific Maritime Ass'n, C 95-4379, 1997 WL \n8 \n488581, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 1997) (“It is a common occurrence for parties to join in the \n9 \nmotions of other parties on the same side in a case [and] [i]f the grounds stated in the motion \n10 \nare applicable to the joining party as well as the moving party, it would be wasteful for them to \n11 \nfile separate motions.”).  Dupuis joins in and adopts the Reply in its entirety, including all \n12 \narguments, assertions and authorities in the Motion and supporting papers.   \n13 \nREPLY \n14 \nIn addition to the Joinder, Dupuis addresses the issue regarding poll worker training in \n15 \nAlameda County raised in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Motions to Dismissal by All Defendants and \n16 \nRequest for Leave to Amend Complaint to Conform with Proof (“Opposition”).  Plaintiffs attempt \n17 \nto single out Dupuis for allegedly failing to train poll workers to offer a “Presidential ballot” \n18 \nbecause two poll workers were claimed to be confused at their training.  See Opp. at pp. 7-8. \n19 \nAs this Court highlighted in its June 2, 2016 order on the preliminary injunction (ECF \n20 \nDocket No. 46, at 5:6-14), California law does not require defendants to affirmatively inform no-\n21 \nparty-preference voters of their rights to obtain a crossover ballot at the polling place. Section \n22 \n13102(b) of the California Elections Code provides, “[a]t partisan primary elections, each voter \n23 \nnot registered disclosing a preference with any one of the political parties participating in an \n24 \nelection shall be furnished only a nonpartisan ballot, unless he or she requests a ballot of a \n25 \npolitical party” that has authorized crossover ballots. Thus, the plain language of the statute \n26 \ncontemplates that the voter would affirmatively request the crossover ballot.   \n27 \n28  1 \n  Dupuis Joinder in SOS Reply ISO MTD \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 59   Filed 07/05/16   Page 3 of 3\n \n1  Even though California law does not require it, Dupuis’ office has spent countless hours \n2  training poll workers to offer NPP voters the cross over ballots – exactly what the Plaintiffs are \n3  seeking.  See Dupuis Declaration ISO Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n4  (ECF Docket No. 40-1) (“Dupuis Decl.”), ¶¶ 12-14. Dupuis also provided material at the \n5  precincts to inform NPP voters of their cross-over options, which the Opposition does not \n6  mention.  See id., ¶ 15. The Opposition only makes a desperate effort to misconstrue the \n7  detailed training materials, pointing to “an empty green field below the title” that reads “Roster-\n8  Index Page: Crossover Voting for Nonpartisan Voters.”  Opp. at pp. 8-9.   That “green empty \n9  field” included a video of a re-enactment of poll workers offering an NPP voter a cross over \n10  ballot.  See Dupuis Decl., ¶ 12-13. More importantly, the Opposition fails to state how any \n11  amendment to the FAC would state a claim against Dupuis under the U.S. Constitution, the \n12  Voting Rights Act, state law, or any other law. \n13   Finally, as they did in their motion for a preliminary injunction (see ECF Docket No. 28 \n14  at p.5, ¶ 10), Plaintiffs again cite to a declaration by Richard Troy.  No such declaration has ever \n15  been filed in this case; the Court must disregard any arguments or “evidence” based on said \n16  declarations. \n17  CONCLUSION \n18  For these reasons, and those stated in Padilla’s Motion to Dismiss and Reply, this Court \n19  must grant the motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. \n20  DATED:    July 5, 2016  DONNA ZIEGLER, County Counsel in and for \nthe County of Alameda, State of California \n21   \n \n22   \nBy /s/ Raymond S.

This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to secure equitable relief from \n5 \nDefendants’ unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by \n6 \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n7 \n8  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. 10101(a)(2)(A) and (B); and other laws of \n9  the United States and the state of California.   This action is also brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n10 \n1361 to seek a writ of mandamus.  Jurisdiction is conferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § \n11 \n1343.  Declaratory relief can be sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and § 2202. \n12 \n  2.  “No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the \n13 \nelection of those who make the laws…” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). Plaintiffs \n14 \nbring the instant lawsuit to protect the right to vote by mail, early voting, registration, and \n15 \n16  informational voting rights of millions of California voters.  Nearly 70% of ballots cast in the \n17  2014 California special election were by mail, and over 65% of the ballots cast in the 2012 \n18 \npresidential preference primary were by mail.  http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-\n19 \nabsentee/   \n20 \n3.         The impact of failure to inform NPP voters (no party preference voters) of their \n21 \nright to obtain a “crossover ballot” and to vote in the Presidential primary is significant, as is the \n22 \nfailure to inform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no party preference voters \n23 \n24  and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, American Independent, and \n25 \nLibertarian parties.  All Californians’ voting rights have been and will continue to be denied or \n26 \nunreasonably infringed upon due to the lack of oversight of the California Secretary of State and \n27 \ncounty Boards of Elections.   \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 3 of 14\n \n1           4.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to redress the widespread and \n2 \nongoing failure to provide information regarding the protected voting rights of “no party \n3 \npreference” voters to receive a Democratic, American Independent or Libertarian presidential \n4 \nballot.   Inadequate information has also been provided regarding the right of “no party \n5 \npreference voters” to personally deliver their application to vote by mail to the county board of \n6 \nelections office by May 31, 2016 in order to mail their ballot in by the last day of the primary on \n7 \n8  June 7.    \n9  5.  This failure to provide adequate information is in violation of the Voting Rights Act of \n10 \n1965, 52 U.S.C.A. § 10101 et seq, California Elections Code Section 3000 et seq., and the U.S. \n11 \nConstitution’s guarantee of Equal Protection, applied to states pursuant to the Fourteenth \n12 \nAmendment.  Plaintiffs are eligible California voters (one Democratic and one no party \n13 \npreference); Voting Rights Defense Project (an organization campaigning to heighten voter \n14 \neducation and voter turnout for their candidate Bernie Sanders); and the American Independent \n15 \n16  Party itself.  These Plaintiffs and their associational members have been deprived of voting \n17  rights, as have the many similarly situated voters who have complained to their local Boards of \n18 \nElections regarding applications to vote by mail, early voting, registration, and informational \n19 \nvoting rights.  Thousands of Californians are in imminent danger of being disenfranchised in the \n20 \n2016 presidential primary election ending on June 7, 2016, and will continue to be shut out of the \n21 \ndemocratic process unless and until Defendants reform their voting by mail practices.  \n22 \n            6.  Congress enacted section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to prevent certain \n23 \n24  types of situations.  One situation is where some voters in a county are being treated in a \n25 \ndifferent manner from other voters in the county.  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A).  The other \n26 \nsituation is where individuals are denied the right to vote “because of an error or omission on any \n27 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  record or paper” which is “not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under \n2 \nState law to vote.”  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B)  \n3 \n7.  Defendant Tim Dupuis, the chief of the Alameda County Registrar of Voters, has \n4 \nengaged in a pattern and practice that will disenfranchise thousands of Alameda County voters.  \n5 \nDuring the last two weeks, this Defendant distributed a series of notices to Alameda County \n6 \nvoters that did not provide information that is required to be given to California voters pursuant \n7 \n8  to Elections Code Section 3000 et seq.   Because of this failure to provide proper notice, these \n9  voters will be unable to vote for the candidate of their choice unless there is prompt and effective \n10 \nintervention by this court.                   \n11 \n  8.        Specifically, both the Defendants Tim Dupuis and John Arntz (chief of the San \n12 \nFrancisco Department of Elections) distributed to the voters an electronic application to vote for \n13 \nmail on Dupuis’ Oakland website and Artnz’s San Francisco website that violated Elections \n14 \nCode § 3006(c) and 3007.7(e).  Both of these applications failed to provide the mandatory notice \n15 \n16  to all voters of their right to state no party preference; and, further, that a no party preference \n17 \nvoter shall be provided with a Democratic, American Independent Party or a Libertarian Party \n18 \nPresidential primary ballot.   \n19 \n9.         Furthermore, Defendant Arntz (and on information and belief, Defendant Dupuis) \n20 \nviolated Elections Code Section 3006 by preparing the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample \n21 \nBallot in a non-uniform manner.  This time, the aforementioned mandatory notice was properly \n22 \n23  provided at the back page of the pamphlet to all the no party preference voters.  However, the \n24  mandatory notice was not provided to the voters that were members of political parties.   It was \n25 \nmandatory to provide this information by law to all voters, not just the no party preference \n26 \nvoters.                       \n27 \n  10.  The failure to provide this information meant that Bay Area citizens who were \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 5 of 14\n \n1  members of political parties were not provided with choices that reasonably could have led them \n2 \nto select no party preference and request a Presidential primary ballot.  This same error was \n3 \ncommitted in Santa Barbara County and other counties throughout the state of California. This \n4 \nstatewide error occurred even after the Secretary of State created a uniform vote by mail \n5 \napplication that conformed with Elections Code 3007.5 and included the proper language that \n6 \nwas missing as described above.  For reasons of their own, the Defendants and many of their \n7 \n8  colleagues throughout the state elected not to use the Secretary of State’s uniform vote by mail \n9  application, but instead omitted essential terms in their applications. \n10 \n11.       Another essential term that was missing in certain applications created by the \n11 \nDefendants was the mandatory notice contained in Elections Code 3006(b)(3) that applicants to \n12 \nvote by mail have the “legal right” to personally “deliver” the application to the County \n13 \nElections Office by May 31 rather than rely on mail or fax.   These particular application forms \n14 \nwould mention the May 31 date, but did not mention the “personal delivery” option or that the \n15 \n16  applicant had the “legal right” to deliver the application in this fashion.       \n17    12.  It is reasonable to assume that this omission will result in more late applications \n18 \nand less early voting, as applicants who deliver the application could receive the proper \n19 \nPresidential primary ballot and vote right there on the spot.   In turn, it is reasonable to assume \n20 \nthat late applications will result in many more citizens failing to obtain a Presidential primary \n21 \nballot.       \n22 \n23  PARTIES TO THE ACTION \n24  13.       Both Defendants Tim Dupuis and John Arntz, as part of their official duties, are \n25 \nresponsible for conducting Federal, State, County, special and local elections.  Thus, they are \n26 \nsued in their official capacities.  Pursuant to the leadership of these Defendants, the Alameda \n27 \nCounty Registrar of Voters and the San Francisco Department of Elections prepare the published \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 6 of 14\n \n1  notices of elections and lists of offices for which candidates are to be nominated. It is the duty of \n2 \nthese agencies to prepare and print official and sample ballots; mail sample ballots to registered \n3 \nvoters; recruit election officers and polling places; and provide the roster and street index and \n4 \nother supplies for use by the election officers at the polls. These agencies are also required to \n5 \nestablish and revise voting precincts, provide for the tabulation of returns on election night, and \n6 \nconduct the official canvass of votes cast.   \n7 \n8  14.   Furthermore, these agencies had the duty to prepare applications to vote by mail that \n9  complied with the mandatory notices contained in the uniform vote by mail application prepared \n10 \nby the Secretary of State.  As described above, the defendants and similar agencies throughout \n11 \nthe state failed in providing these mandatory notices. Based on information and belief, the \n12 \ndefendants have been involved in training poll workers to provide no preference party voters \n13 \nwith provisional ballots; the plaintiffs seek an order that a provisional ballot will be given to a \n14 \nvoter only when there is no other alternative.   News reports state that a high percentage of \n15 \n16  provisional ballots never make it into the official count. \n17  15.   The Secretary of State Alex Padilla is named as an indispensable party.  The \n18 \nSecretary of State created the regulations that the Elections Code rely on.  On information and \n19 \nbelief, the Secretary of State failed to properly advise the other Defendants, despite the enormous \n20 \nautonomy that the Defendants enjoy in running their own affairs free of interference from the \n21 \nSecretary.     \n22 \n16.  Plaintiff Voting Rights Defense Project is an unincorporated association based in \n23 \n24  Oakland, California.  The organizational plaintiff was created to campaign for the success of \n25 \nBernie Sanders in his quest for votes in the California Presidential primary.  It has no formal \n26 \nrelationship with the Sanders campaign.  This Plaintiff is engaged in taking action of various \n27 \nkinds with like-minded voters to ensure that the turnout for their preferred candidate is as large \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  as possible.  As voting in this primary began on May 9 and will continue until June 7, the \n2 \nprimary election has officially begun and the campaigning activity is ongoing.  \n3 \n17.  Plaintiff American Independent Party of California is a political party that has \n4 \nobtained ballot space in California.  Elections Code Section 7500.  The rules governing its ballot \n5 \naccess are contained within Elections Code 6500 et seq.; in these sections, this Plaintiff  is \n6 \nreferred to as simply the American Independent Party. \n7 \n8  18.   Plaintiff Suzanne Bushnell is a registered Democratic voter in the City and County \n9  of San Francisco.   As a Democratic voter in San Francisco and the state of California, she has \n10 \nbeen injured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the mandatory notice provisions \n11 \nset forth above.  She has “informational standing” due to these omissions by the Defendants, and \n12 \nshe is entitled to relief designed to restore her to the situation she would have been in if this \n13 \ninformation was not denied to her.   She is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a \n14 \nPresidential party ballot for Bernie Sanders if she becomes a no party preference voter.  Her \n15 \n16  rights as a voter have been chilled as a result.           \n17    19.    Plaintiff Clara Daims is a registered no party preference voter in the City and \n18 \nCounty of San Francisco.   As a no party preference voter in San Francisco and the state of \n19 \nCalifornia, she has been injured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the \n20 \nmandatory notice provisions set forth above.  She has “informational standing” due to these \n21 \nomissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled to relief designed to restore her to the situation \n22 \nshe would have been in if this information was not denied to her.   She is uncertain whether she \n23 \n24  will be able to obtain a Presidential party ballot for Bernie Sanders if she remains a no party \n25 \npreference voter.  Her rights as a voter have been chilled as a result.       \n26 \n     \n27 \n  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(A) and 42 USC 1983) \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  20.  Paragraphs 1-19 are incorporated by reference.  \n2 \n21.  Defendants’ actions violate 52 USC 10101(a)(2), generally known as “Section 2” \n3 \nof the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   \n4 \n22. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part: \n5 \n(2) No person acting under color of law shall – \n6 \n(A) in determining whether any individual is qualified under State \n7 \n8  law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, practice, or \n9  procedure difference from the standards, practices or procedures \n10 \napplied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same \n11 \ncounty, parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found \n12 \nby State officials to be qualified to vote. . . \n13 \n23. Private litigants may enforce their rights under 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a) by bringing \n14 \na suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   Defendants, acting under color of state law, \n15 \n16  applied different standards, practices, or procedures in determining whether party \n17  voters would be given voter informational rights than were applied to no party \n18 \npreference voters.  \n19 \n24. Plaintiffs will continue to suffer the violation of their rights as alleged in the \n20 \nComplaint absent relief granted by the Court. \n21 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) and 42 USC 1983) \n22 \n25.  Paragraphs 1-24 are incorporated by reference. \n23 \n24  26.  52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part:  \"No \n25 \nperson acting under color of state law shall … deny the right of any individual to \n26 \nvote in any election because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating \n27 \nto any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 9 of 14\n \n1  omission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under \n2 \nState law to vote in such election.\"  See Schwier v. Cox, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1266 \n3 \n(N.D. Ga. 2005) (finding a Georgia requirement that voting registrants disclose \n4 \nSocial Security number before voting violated materiality provision of Voting \n5 \nRights Act), aff'd, 439 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir. 2006).    \n6 \n27.  Certain Plaintiffs – or the individuals that they represent - are in imminent danger \n7 \n8  of being denied the right to vote in the Presidential primary election because of the \n9  errors and omissions contained in the mandatory notices containing crucial \n10 \ninformation necessary in order to obtain the ballot.  These errors or omissions are \n11 \nnot material in determining whether these individuals are qualified under State law \n12 \nto vote in the June 2016 Presidential primary election. \n13 \n      THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (First and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42 USC 1983)   \n14 \n28. Paragraphs 1-27 are incorporated by reference.  \n15 \n16  29. Defendants’ actions violated the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution \n17  and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States \n18 \nConstitution, as the acts of the defendants towards the no party preference voters \n19 \nconstituted arbitrary discrimination of these plaintiffs as well as the associational \n20 \nclasses that Voting Rights Defense Project and American Independent Party \n21 \nrepresent.  \n22 \n30.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution require that courts \n23 \n24  closely scrutinize challenged election regulations, weighing “the character and \n25 \nmagnitude of the asserted injury . . . against the precise interests put forward by the \n26 \nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.”  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 \n27 \nU.S. 428, 434 (1992).  \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  31. Even when voters are only modestly burdened by State action, the State’s “precise \n2 \ninterests” must be able to justify the regulation, which must in turn be both \n3 \n“reasonable” and “nondiscriminatory,” id.; see also U.S. Taxpayers Party of \n4 \nFlorida v. Smith, 871 F. Supp. 426, 435 (N.D. Fla. 1993) (citing New Alliance \n5 \nParty v. Hand, 933 F.2d 1568 (11th Cir. 1991), as holding that “although the \n6 \nburden imposed on minor parties was not insurmountable, the interests put forth by \n7 \n8  the state were inadequate to justify the restriction imposed.”).        \n9  32. When the burden is more severe, the regulation in question must be able to survive \n10 \nstrict scrutiny. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434.  When the law applies differently to pre-\n11 \nexisting classes of similarly situated citizens seeking to exercise their fundamental \n12 \nrights, the distinction is analyzed under strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Wexler v. \n13 \nAnderson, 452 F.3d 1226, 1231-32 (11th Cir. 2006) (indicating heightened \n14 \nscrutiny if the plaintiffs had pled that voters in touchscreen counties were less \n15 \n16  likely to cast an effective vote than voters in optical scan counties, and citing Dunn \n17  v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972) (“[A] citizen has a constitutionally \n18 \nprotected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in \n19 \nthe jurisdiction.”) . \n20 \n \n21 \n    FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Mandamus) \n22 \n33.  Paragraphs 1-32 are incorporated by reference.         \n23 \n34.  Defendants’ actions violated existing state law pursuant to Elections Code Section \n24 \n3000 et seq.  Because these actions violated state law, Plaintiffs seek mandamus \n25 \npursuant to 28 USC 1361 to ensure that the voters’ informational rights are \n26 \n27  protected; that the voters are able to register either with a political party or without \n28  a political party as they see fit; that the voters are able to obtain the proper ballots \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 11 of 14\n \n1  at the Board of Elections and are able to vote before the last day of elections; and \n2 \nthat the ballots are properly accepted and counted by the Board of Elections. \n3 \n/// \n4 \n PRAYER  \n5 \n            For good cause, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and a writ of \n6 \nmandamus.   \n7 \n8  1.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \n9  declaring that Defendants’ challenge and removal procedures (a) violate Section 2 of \n10 \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, (b) were made with a arbitrarily \n11 \ndiscriminatory purpose in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § \n12 \n10301, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (c) violate \n13 \nthe Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Furthermore, grant \n14 \nPlaintiffs the specific relief sought without regard as to label:    \n15 \n16  2.  Wide distribution of this information via radio, TV, newspaper, internet social media \n17  platforms in Alameda County and throughout the state of California; \n18 \n3.  Ensuring that sufficient ballot forms for all of the Presidential primary candidates are \n19 \nat all of the polling places on June 7;         \n20 \n4.  That no party preference voters are not refused a Presidential primary ballot if they \n21 \npersonally appear at their proper polling place;           \n22 \n5.  Changing the applications at the Board of Elections websites in Alameda County, San \n23 \n24  Francisco, and throughout the state of California to conform with the essential terms \n25 \nset forth in the uniform application created by the Secretary of State; \n26 \n6.  An order permitting the write-in of the Democratic, American Independent Party, and \n27 \nLibertarian candidates, or, in the alternative, segregation of the ballots that have \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                             11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 2   Filed 05/20/16   Page 12 of 14\n \n1  already been cast by those with no party preference registration in order to permit \n2 \nvoters to re-vote for the candidate of their choice by June 7; \n3 \n7.  An order extending the registration deadline to June 7, in order to ensure that no party \n4 \npreference voters are properly informed of the option to either re-register with a party \n5 \nor request a Democratic, American Independent Party or Libertarian Party \n6 \nPresidential primary ballot;              \n7 \n8  8.  An order, as well, stating that party voters are properly informed of the option to re-\n9  register as no party preference and request a Democratic, American Independent \n10 \nParty or Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot if that is their preference;\\ \n11 \n9.  An order that provisional ballots will not be issued to voters unless there is no other \n12 \nalternative. \n13 \n10. Reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to CC Section 1988 and CCP Section 1021.5; \n14 \n11. Reasonable costs;                  \n15 \n16  12. Such other relief as the court may deem proper. \n.         \n17 \n18        DATED:    May 20, 2016       \n19 \n  \n20  By: ___________/s/_________________  \nWilliam M. Simpich \n21 \nStephen R.

This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to secure equitable relief from \n5 \nDefendants’ unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by \n6 \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n7 \n8  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. 10101(a)(2)(A) and (B); and other laws of \n9  the United States and the state of California.   This action is also brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n10 \n1361 to seek a writ of mandamus.  Jurisdiction is conferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § \n11 \n1343.  Declaratory relief can be sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and § 2202. \n12 \n  2.  “No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the \n13 \nelection of those who make the laws…” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). Plaintiffs \n14 \nbring the instant lawsuit to protect the right to vote by mail, early voting, registration, and \n15 \n16  informational voting rights of millions of California voters.  Nearly 70% of ballots cast in the \n17  2014 California special election were by mail, and over 65% of the ballots cast in the 2012 \n18 \npresidential preference primary were by mail.  http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-\n19 \nabsentee/   \n20 \n3.         The impact of failure to inform NPP voters (no party preference voters) of their \n21 \nright to obtain a “crossover ballot” and to vote in the Presidential primary is significant, as is the \n22 \nfailure to inform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no party preference voters \n23 \n24  and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, American Independent, and \n25 \nLibertarian parties.  All Californians’ voting rights have been and will continue to be denied or \n26 \nunreasonably infringed upon due to the lack of oversight of the California Secretary of State and \n27 \ncounty Boards of Elections.   \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 3 of 14\n \n1           4.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to redress the widespread and \n2 \nongoing failure to provide information regarding the protected voting rights of “no party \n3 \npreference” voters to receive a Democratic, American Independent or Libertarian presidential \n4 \nballot.   Inadequate information has also been provided regarding the right of “no party \n5 \npreference voters” to personally deliver their application to vote by mail to the county board of \n6 \nelections office by May 31, 2016 in order to mail their ballot in by the last day of the primary on \n7 \n8  June 7.    \n9  5.  This failure to provide adequate information is in violation of the Voting Rights Act of \n10 \n1965, 52 U.S.C.A. § 10101 et seq, California Elections Code Section 3000 et seq., and the U.S. \n11 \nConstitution’s guarantee of Equal Protection, applied to states pursuant to the Fourteenth \n12 \nAmendment.  Plaintiffs are eligible California voters (one Democratic and one no party \n13 \npreference); Voting Rights Defense Project (an organization campaigning to heighten voter \n14 \neducation and voter turnout for their candidate Bernie Sanders); and the American Independent \n15 \n16  Party itself.  These Plaintiffs and their associational members have been deprived of voting \n17  rights, as have the many similarly situated voters who have complained to their local Boards of \n18 \nElections regarding applications to vote by mail, early voting, registration, and informational \n19 \nvoting rights.  Thousands of Californians are in imminent danger of being disenfranchised in the \n20 \n2016 presidential primary election ending on June 7, 2016, and will continue to be shut out of the \n21 \ndemocratic process unless and until Defendants reform their voting by mail practices.  \n22 \n            6.  Congress enacted section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to prevent certain \n23 \n24  types of situations.  One situation is where some voters in a county are being treated in a \n25 \ndifferent manner from other voters in the county.  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A).  The other \n26 \nsituation is where individuals are denied the right to vote “because of an error or omission on any \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  record or paper” which is “not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under \n2 \nState law to vote.”  52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B)  \n3 \n7.  Defendant Tim Depuis, the chief of the Alameda County Registrar of Voters, has \n4 \nengaged in a pattern and practice that will disenfranchise thousands of Alameda County voters.  \n5 \nDuring the last two weeks, this Defendant distributed a series of notices to Alameda County \n6 \nvoters that did not provide information that is required to be given to California voters pursuant \n7 \n8  to Elections Code Section 3000 et seq.   Because of this failure to provide proper notice, these \n9  voters will be unable to vote for the candidate of their choice unless there is prompt and effective \n10 \nintervention by this court.                   \n11 \n  8.        Specifically, both the Defendants Tim Depuis and John Arntz (chief of the San \n12 \nFrancisco Department of Elections) distributed to the voters an electronic application to vote for \n13 \nmail on Depuis’ Oakland website and Artnz’s San Francisco website that violated Elections \n14 \nCode § 3006(c) and 3007.7(e).  Both of these applications failed to provide the mandatory notice \n15 \n16  to all voters of their right to state no party preference; and, further, that a no party preference \n17 \nvoter shall be provided with a Democratic, American Independent Party or a Libertarian Party \n18 \nPresidential primary ballot.   \n19 \n9.         Furthermore, Defendant Arntz (and on information and belief, Defendant Depuis) \n20 \nviolated Elections Code Section 3006 by preparing the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample \n21 \nBallot in a non-uniform manner.  This time, the aforementioned mandatory notice was properly \n22 \n23  provided at the back page of the pamphlet to all the no party preference voters.  However, the \n24  mandatory notice was not provided to the voters that were members of political parties.   It was \n25 \nmandatory to provide this information by law to all voters, not just the no party preference \n26 \nvoters.                       \n27 \n  10.  The failure to provide this information meant that Bay Area citizens who were \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 5 of 14\n \n1  members of political parties were not provided with choices that reasonably could have led them \n2 \nto select no party preference and request a Presidential primary ballot.  This same error was \n3 \ncommitted in Santa Barbara County and other counties throughout the state of California. This \n4 \nstatewide error occurred even after the Secretary of State created a uniform vote by mail \n5 \napplication that conformed with Elections Code 3007.5 and included the proper language that \n6 \nwas missing as described above.  For reasons of their own, the Defendants and many of their \n7 \n8  colleagues throughout the state elected not to use the Secretary of State’s uniform vote by mail \n9  application, but instead omitted essential terms in their applications. \n10 \n11.       Another essential term that was missing in certain applications created by the \n11 \nDefendants was the mandatory notice contained in Elections Code 3006(b)(3) that applicants to \n12 \nvote by mail have the “legal right” to personally “deliver” the application to the County \n13 \nElections Office by May 31 rather than rely on mail or fax.   These particular application forms \n14 \nwould mention the May 31 date, but did not mention the “personal delivery” option or that the \n15 \n16  applicant had the “legal right” to deliver the application in this fashion.       \n17    12.  It is reasonable to assume that this omission will result in more late applications \n18 \nand less early voting, as applicants who deliver the application could receive the proper \n19 \nPresidential primary ballot and vote right there on the spot.   In turn, it is reasonable to assume \n20 \nthat late applications will result in many more citizens failing to obtain a Presidential primary \n21 \nballot.       \n22 \n23  PARTIES TO THE ACTION \n24  13.       Both Defendants Tim Depuis and John Arntz, as part of their official duties, are \n25 \nresponsible for conducting Federal, State, County, special and local elections.  Thus, they are \n26 \nsued in their official capacities.  Pursuant to the leadership of these Defendants, the Alameda \n27 \nCounty Registrar of Voters and the San Francisco Department of Elections prepare the published \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 6 of 14\n \n1  notices of elections and lists of offices for which candidates are to be nominated. It is the duty of \n2 \nthese agencies to prepare and print official and sample ballots; mail sample ballots to registered \n3 \nvoters; recruit election officers and polling places; and provide the roster and street index and \n4 \nother supplies for use by the election officers at the polls. These agencies are also required to \n5 \nestablish and revise voting precincts, provide for the tabulation of returns on election night, and \n6 \nconduct the official canvass of votes cast.   \n7 \n8  14.   Furthermore, these agencies had the duty to prepare applications to vote by mail that \n9  complied with the mandatory notices contained in the uniform vote by mail application prepared \n10 \nby the Secretary of State.  As described above, the defendants and similar agencies throughout \n11 \nthe state failed in providing these mandatory notices.   \n12 \n15.   The Secretary of State Alex Padilla is named as an indispensable party.  The \n13 \nSecretary of State created the regulations that the Elections Code rely on.  On information and \n14 \nbelief, the Secretary of State failed to properly advise the other Defendants, despite the enormous \n15 \n16  autonomy that the Defendants enjoy in running their own affairs free of interference from the \n17  Secretary.     \n18 \n16.  Plaintiff Voting Rights Defense Project is an unincorporated association based in \n19 \nOakland, California.  The organizational plaintiff was created to campaign for the success of \n20 \nBernie Sanders in his quest for votes in the California Presidential primary.  It has no formal \n21 \nrelationship with the Sanders campaign.  This Plaintiff is engaged in taking action of various \n22 \nkinds with like-minded voters to ensure that the turnout for their preferred candidate is as large \n23 \n24  as possible.  As voting in this primary began on May 9 and will continue until June 7, the \n25 \nprimary election has officially begun and the campaigning activity is ongoing.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  17.  Plaintiff American Independent Party is a political party that has obtained ballot \n2 \nspace in California.  The rules governing its ballot access are contained within Elections Code \n3 \n6500 et seq. \n4 \n18.   Plaintiff Suzanne Bushnell is a registered Democratic voter in the City and County \n5 \nof San Francisco.   As a Democratic voter in San Francisco and the state of California, she has \n6 \nbeen injured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the mandatory notice provisions \n7 \n8  set forth above.  She has “informational standing” due to these omissions by the Defendants, and \n9  she is entitled to relief designed to restore her to the situation she would have been in if this \n10 \ninformation was not denied to her.   She is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a \n11 \nPresidential party ballot for Bernie Sanders if she becomes a no party preference voter.  Her \n12 \nrights as a voter have been chilled as a result.           \n13 \n  19.    Plaintiff Clara Daims is a registered no party preference voter in the City and \n14 \nCounty of San Francisco.   As a no party preference voter in San Francisco and the state of \n15 \n16  California, she has been injured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the \n17  mandatory notice provisions set forth above.  She has “informational standing” due to these \n18 \nomissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled to relief designed to restore her to the situation \n19 \nshe would have been in if this information was not denied to her.   She is uncertain whether she \n20 \nwill be able to obtain a Presidential party ballot for Bernie Sanders if she remains a no party \n21 \npreference voter.  Her rights as a voter have been chilled as a result.       \n22 \n     \n23 \n24    FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(A) and 42 USC 1983) \n25 \n20.  Paragraphs 1-19 are incorporated by reference.  \n26 \n21.  Defendants’ actions violate 52 USC 10101(a)(2), generally known as “Section 2” \n27 \nof the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  22. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part: \n2 \n(2) No person acting under color of law shall – \n3 \n(A) in determining whether any individual is qualified under State \n4 \nlaw or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, practice, or \n5 \nprocedure difference from the standards, practices or procedures \n6 \napplied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same \n7 \n8  county, parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found \n9  by State officials to be qualified to vote. . . \n10 \n23. Private litigants may enforce their rights under 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a) by bringing \n11 \na suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   Defendants, acting under color of state law, \n12 \napplied different standards, practices, or procedures in determining whether party \n13 \nvoters would be given voter informational rights than were applied to no party \n14 \npreference voters.  \n15 \n16  24. Plaintiffs will continue to suffer the violation of their rights as alleged in the \n17  Complaint absent relief granted by the Court. \n18 \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) and 42 USC 1983) \n19 \n25.  Paragraphs 1-24 are incorporated by reference. \n20 \n26.  52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part:  \"No \n21 \nperson acting under color of state law shall … deny the right of any individual to \n22 \nvote in any election because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating \n23 \n24  to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or \n25 \nomission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified under \n26 \nState law to vote in such election.\"  See Schwier v. Cox, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1266 \n27 \n(N.D. Ga. 2005) (finding a Georgia requirement that voting registrants disclose \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 9 of 14\n \n1  Social Security number before voting violated materiality provision of Voting \n2 \nRights Act), aff'd, 439 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir. 2006).    \n3 \n27.  Certain Plaintiffs – or the individuals that they represent - are in imminent danger \n4 \nof being denied the right to vote in the Presidential primary election because of the \n5 \nerrors and omissions contained in the mandatory notices containing crucial \n6 \ninformation necessary in order to obtain the ballot.  These errors or omissions are \n7 \n8  not material in determining whether these individuals are qualified under State law \n9  to vote in the June 2016 Presidential primary election. \n10 \n      THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (First and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42 USC 1983)   \n11 \n28. Paragraphs 1-27 are incorporated by reference.  \n12 \n29. Defendants’ actions violated the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution \n13 \nand the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States \n14 \nConstitution, as the acts of the defendants towards the no party preference voters \n15 \n16  constituted arbitrary discrimination of these plaintiffs as well as the associational \n17  classes that Voting Rights Defense Project and American Independent Party \n18 \nrepresent.  \n19 \n30.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution require that courts \n20 \nclosely scrutinize challenged election regulations, weighing “the character and \n21 \nmagnitude of the asserted injury . . . against the precise interests put forward by the \n22 \nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.”  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 \n23 \n24  U.S. 428, 434 (1992).  \n25 \n31. Even when voters are only modestly burdened by State action, the State’s “precise \n26 \ninterests” must be able to justify the regulation, which must in turn be both \n27 \n“reasonable” and “nondiscriminatory,” id.; see also U.S. Taxpayers Party of \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  Florida v. Smith, 871 F. Supp. 426, 435 (N.D. Fla. 1993) (citing New Alliance \n2 \nParty v. Hand, 933 F.2d 1568 (11th Cir. 1991), as holding that “although the \n3 \nburden imposed on minor parties was not insurmountable, the interests put forth by \n4 \nthe state were inadequate to justify the restriction imposed.”).        \n5 \n32. When the burden is more severe, the regulation in question must be able to survive \n6 \nstrict scrutiny. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434.  When the law applies differently to pre-\n7 \n8  existing classes of similarly situated citizens seeking to exercise their fundamental \n9  rights, the distinction is analyzed under strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Wexler v. \n10 \nAnderson, 452 F.3d 1226, 1231-32 (11th Cir. 2006) (indicating heightened \n11 \nscrutiny if the plaintiffs had pled that voters in touchscreen counties were less \n12 \nlikely to cast an effective vote than voters in optical scan counties, and citing Dunn \n13 \nv. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972) (“[A] citizen has a constitutionally \n14 \nprotected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in \n15 \n16  the jurisdiction.”) . \n17   \n    FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Mandamus) \n18 \n33.  Paragraphs 1-32 are incorporated by reference.         \n19 \n20  34.  Defendants’ actions violated existing state law pursuant to Elections Code Section \n21 \n3000 et seq.  Because these actions violated state law, Plaintiffs seek mandamus \n22 \npursuant to 28 USC 1361 to ensure that the voters’ informational rights are \n23 \nprotected; that the voters are able to register either with a political party or without \n24 \na political party as they see fit; that the voters are able to obtain the proper ballots \n25 \nat the Board of Elections and are able to vote before the last day of elections; and \n26 \n27  that the ballots are properly accepted and counted by the Board of Elections. \n28  /// \nCOMPLAINT  FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ET AL.                                          10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739   Document 1   Filed 05/20/16   Page 11 of 14\n \n1   PRAYER  \n2 \n            For good cause, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and a writ of \n3 \nmandamus.   \n4 \n1.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \n5 \ndeclaring that Defendants’ challenge and removal procedures (a) violate Section 2 of \n6 \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. § 10301, (b) were made with a arbitrarily \n7 \n8  discriminatory purpose in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § \n9  10301, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (c) violate \n10 \nthe Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Furthermore, grant \n11 \nPlaintiffs the specific relief sought without regard as to label:    \n12 \n2.  Wide distribution of this information via radio, TV, newspaper, internet social media \n13 \nplatforms in Alameda County and throughout the state of California; \n14 \n3.  Ensuring that sufficient ballot forms for all of the Presidential primary candidates are \n15 \n16  at all of the polling places on June 7;         \n17  4.  That no party preference voters are not refused a Presidential primary ballot if they \n18 \npersonally appear at their proper polling place;           \n19 \n5.  Changing the applications at the Board of Elections websites in Alameda County, San \n20 \nFrancisco, and throughout the state of California to conform with the essential terms \n21 \nset forth in the uniform application created by the Secretary of State; \n22 \n6.  An order permitting the write-in of the Democratic, American Independent Party, and \n23 \n24  Libertarian candidates, or, in the alternative, segregation of the ballots that have \n25 \nalready been cast by those with no party preference registration in order to permit \n26 \nvoters to re-vote for the candidate of their choice by June 7; \n27 \n7.

An order, as well, stating that party voters are properly informed of the option to re-\n5 \nregister as no party preference and request a Democratic, American Independent \n6 \nParty or Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot if that is their preference; \n7 \n8  9.  Reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to CC Section 1988 and CCP Section 1021.5; \n9  10. Reasonable costs;                  \n10 \n11.

This motion is based \nupon the following facts: \n1.  The subject matter of the underlying application for a preliminary injunction \n(submitted to the Court with an ex parte application and motion to shorten time) \nconcerns the California Democratic Party primary election to occur on June 7, \n2016; \n \n   \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 17   Filed 05/27/16   Page 2 of 4\n2.  Because of the nature of the remedies sought by the preliminary injunction \napplied for by the plaintiffs, to alleviate and mitigate the immediate and \nirreparable harm presently being caused by the dissemination of incorrect, \nmisleading and incomplete information by the defendants to California voters \nwho designated “no party preference” on their voter registrations and who wish \nto exercise their right to vote in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential \nprimary,1  plaintiffs’ application for a preliminary injunction must be heard and \nadjudicated by the court at the earliest possible time. Plaintiffs therefore request \na hearing on their application for a preliminary injunction be held Wednesday, \nJune 1, 2016, or on the soonest possible date for this court prior to Tuesday, June \n7.  The counsel for the Secretary of State has asked that this matter not be set for \nFriday, June 3. \n3.  Notice of this ex parte application was provided to counsel for all defendants on \nMay 26, 2016 by William M. Simpich, counsel for plaintiffs. \n4.  The main relief sought by the Plaintiffs is as follows: \nA.  Because of erroneous information spread statewide due to the Secretary of \nState's omissions regarding its failure to monitor the boards of elections and \ntheir numerous failures to adhere to the notice mandated by Elections Code \n3006(b)(3), 3006(c), and 3007.7 as stated in the Secretary of State’s uniform \nvote-by-mail application: \n(1)  Public service announcements be sent out statewide to ensure \nuniformity in voting procedures by email, internet postings, radio and TV, \nstating as follows:      \n                                                 \n1 The facts setting forth the immediate and irreparable harm to plaintiffs and affected \nCalifornia voters are set forth in the declarations filed in support of plaintiffs’ application for a \npreliminary injunction. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 17   Filed 05/27/16   Page 3 of 4\n(a)  All California voters have the right to receive a Presidential party \nballot if they are registered as of May 23, 2016, as stated in Elections \nCode 3006. \n(b) All California voters have the right to be informed that the deadline to \nrequest a vote by mail ballot is set by statute as May 31, as stated in \nElections Code Section 3006(c) \n(c) All California voters have the right to receive a regular Presidential \nballot at the polling place, even if they did not file an application to \nvote by mail. \n(d) All California voters have the right to be offered a regular Presidential \nballot by the poll workers when they arrive at the polls, although they \nwill have to receive a provisional ballot if they fail to bring to the polls \nany vote by mail ballot that has been sent to them. \nB.   All poll workers shall inform the no party preference voters of their right to \nrequest a Presidential party ballot; \nC.  Sufficient ballots shall be provided at every polling station, which should be \nhigher than the statutory standard set forth in the California Elections Code \nSection 14102 due to the high influx of no party preference voters registering \nsince the previous election. \n5.   The more ambitious relief sought by the Plaintiffs is that registration to vote be \nreopened until as late as Election Day if possible, in an attempt to remedy the \nfailures in registration caused by the confusion resulting from the errors \ncommitted by both these defendants and statewide, in order to protect the rights \nset forth in the Voting Rights Act and in the Equal Protection Clause.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 17   Filed 05/27/16   Page 4 of 4\n  \nPlaintiffs’ motion is based on this motion, the ex parte application on file, the \ndeclarations and exhibits provided to the court, the Plaintiffs’ memorandum of \npoints and authorities, the amended complaint and the request for amendment to \nthe complaint, and all oral or documentary evidence that may be presented at the \ntime of the hearing. \nRespectfully submitted, \nWILLIAM M.

2016 at 8:00 a.m., or as soon thereafter as the \n3  matter may be heard before the Honorable William Alsup in Courtroom 8 of the United States \n4  District Court for the Northern District of California, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San \n5  Francisco, California, 94102, defendant Alex Padilla, in his official capacity of Secretary of State \n6  of the State of California, will move this Court to dismiss without leave to amend plaintiffs’ First \n7  Amended Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Declaratory Relief, and Mandamus pursuant to Federal \n8  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \n9  This motion to dismiss is brought on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a claim as \n10  a matter of law.  This motion is based on this Notice of Motion and Motion, the Memorandum of \n11  Points and Authorities, the papers and pleadings on file in this action, and upon such other \n12  matters as may be presented to the Court at the time of the hearing. \n13   \n14  Dated:  June 14, 2016  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \n15  KAMALA D. HARRIS \nAttorney General of California \n16  TAMAR PACHTER \nSupervising Deputy Attorney General \n17   \n \n18  /s/ Sharon L. O’Grady \n \n19  SHARON L.

As to the Secretary of State, the Complaint1 alleges only:  (1) that he is an \n5  “indispensable party,” and (2) on information and belief, that he “failed to properly advise the \n6  other Defendants.”  Complaint ¶ 15.  These allegations fail as a matter of law to state a claim \n7  upon which relief may be granted, and should be dismissed without leave to amend.  As a \n8  threshold matter, the Complaint does not present a justiciable controversy, if it ever did, because \n9  the election was concluded on June 7, rendering plaintiffs’ claims moot.  On the merits, the \n10  Complaint does not allege facts that plausibly state a claim for relief under the standards set forth \n11  in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-80 (2009), and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n12  544, 555-57 (2007).  And as a matter of law, plaintiffs cannot allege a violation of either the \n13  federal Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.  Finally, this Court lacks jurisdiction over \n14  plaintiffs’ state law claims, which are substantively without merit. \n15  BACKGROUND \n16  I.  THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S ROLE IN THE ELECTION PROCESS \n17  The Secretary of State is the chief elections officer in California.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 10.  \n18  The Secretary “shall see that elections are efficiently conducted and that state election laws are \n19  enforced.”  CAL. Gov’t CODE § 12172.5(a).  The Secretary’s powers are important but limited:  \n20  the Secretary cannot issue enforcement orders requiring local election officials to comply with the \n21  law.  Rather, “[i]f, at any time, the Secretary of State concludes that the election laws are not \n22  being enforced, the Secretary of State shall call the violations to the attention of the district \n23  attorney of the county or the Attorney General.”  Id. § 12172.5(b).   \n24  II.  THE JUNE 7 PRIMARY ELECTION AND THIS ACTION \n25  The presidential primary election in California was held on June 7, 2016, a date established \n26  in California Elections Code section 340.  The last day to register to vote, or to re-register to vote \n                                                           \n27  1 All references herein are to the operative First Amended Complaint, filed May 20, 2016, \nECF No. 2. \n28 \n  2   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 8 of 19\n \n1  to change parties or to become a no-party-preference voter, was May 23, 2016.  Vote by mail \n2  applications include language advising no-party-preference voters of their right to request a \n3  primary ballot for those political parties that have opted to allow no-party-preference voters to \n4  participate in their primary elections.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3006(c).  In addition to printed vote-by-\n5  mail applications, local elections officials may, but are not required to, offer an electronic vote-\n6  by-mail application.  Id. § 3007.7.  Voters also may establish permanent vote-by-mail status.  Id. \n7  § 3201.  Prior to every partisan primary election, county elections officials are required to send \n8  out a notice and application to every no-party-preference voter who is also a permanent vote-by-\n9  mail voter, informing the voter “that he or she may request a vote by mail ballot for a particular \n10  party for the primary election, if that political party adopted a party rule” allowing no-party-\n11  preference voters to vote in their primary.  Id. § 3205(b).  The accompanying application allows \n12  the no-party-preference voter to write in the political party ballot he or she wishes to receive.  Id.   \n13  Plaintiffs filed this action on May 20, 2016.  The Complaint alleges violations of the Voting \n14  Rights Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  In \n15  addition, the Complaint contains a claim for writ of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361, based on \n16  defendants’ alleged violations of the California Elections Code.  On May 27, 2016, plaintiffs filed \n17  a motion for preliminary injunction, and requested an expedited hearing.  At the June 1, 2016 \n18  hearing, the Court denied all relief.  See Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 1, ECF No. 46. \n19  III.  THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT \n20  Plaintiffs are the Voting Rights Defense Project (“VRDP”), an unincorporated association \n21  created to campaign for Senator Bernie Sanders in the California Presidential primary; the \n22  American Independent Party of California; a registered Democratic voter; and a registered no-\n23  party-preference voter.  Complaint ¶¶ 16-19.  Defendants are the Secretary of State of California, \n24  the Chief of the San Francisco Department of Elections, and the Chief of the Alameda County \n25  Registrar of Voters.  Complaint ¶¶ 7-8.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief based on \n26  the following claims in their Complaint:  \n27 \n28 \n  3   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 9 of 19\n \n1  A.  The First Claim for Relief – Section 10101(a)(2)(A) of the Voting Rights \nAct \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated section 10101(a)(2)(A) of the Voting Rights \n4  Act, which provides that “[n]o person acting under color of law shall[,] in determining whether \n5  any individual is qualified under State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, \n6  practice, or procedure difference [sic] from the standards, practices or procedures applied under \n7  such law or laws to other individuals within the same county, parch, or similar political \n8  subdivision who have been found by State officials to be qualified to vote.” Complaint ¶¶ 21-22.  \n9  B.  The Second Claim for Relief - Section 10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights \nAct \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated section 10101(a)(2)(A) of the Voting Rights \n12  Act, which provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o person acting under color of state law shall . . . \n13  deny the right of any individual to vote in any election because of an error or omission in any \n14  record or paper relating to an application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such \n15  error or omission is not material in determing whether such individual is qualified under State law \n16  to vote in such election.”  Complaint ¶¶ 26-27. \n17  C.  The Third Claim for Relief – The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution \n18 \n19  Plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated the First Amendment and the Equal \n20  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by engaging in “arbitrary discrimination” of \n21  plaintiffs and “the associational classes that Voting Rights Defense Project and American \n22  Independent Party represent.”  Complaint ¶ 29. \n23  D.  The Fourth Claim for Relief - Mandamus \n24  Plaintiffs allege that defendants’ conduct violated the California Elections Code, and seeks \n25  a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n26  E.  The Relief Plaintiffs Seek \n27  Plaintiffs seek a judgment “declaring that Defendants’ challenge and removal procedures \n28  violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act” and the Fourteenth Amendment.  Complaint, Prayer \n  4   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 10 of 19\n \n1  Item 1.  Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief, although incoherent, seeks relief specifically \n2  relating to the June 7 primary election.  It seeks (a) “Wide distribution of this information” \n3  through various media “in Alameda County and throughout the state of California;” (b) “Ensuring \n4  that sufficient ballot forms for all of the Presidential primary candidates are at all of the polling \n5  places on June 7;” (c) “That no party preference voters” who “personally appear at their proper \n6  polling place” “are not refused a Presidential primary ballot”; (d) “Changing the applications at \n7  the Board of Elections websites in Alameda County, San Francisco, and throughout the state of \n8  California to conform with the essential terms set forth in the uniform application created by the \n9  Secretary of State;” (e) “An order permitting the write-in of the Democratic, American \n10  Independent Party, and Libertarian candidates, or, in the alternative, segregation of the ballots that \n11  have already been cast” by no-part-preference voters to permit them “to re-vote for the candidate \n12  of their choice by June 7;” (f) “An order extending the registration deadline to June 7”; (g) “An \n13  order, as well, stating that party voters are properly informed of the option to reregister as no \n14  party preference and request a Democratic, American Independent Party or Libertarian \n15  Presidential primary ballot if that is their preference;” and (h) “An order that provisional ballots \n16  will not be issued to voters unless there is no other alternative.”  Id., Prayer Items 2-9. \n17  ARGUMENT \n18  I.  LEGAL STANDARD \n19  A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \n20  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion “tests the legal sufficiency of a claim.”  \n21  Conservation Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d 1240, 1242 (9th Cir. 2011).  Dismissal is proper where \n22  there is no cognizable legal theory or there are insufficient facts alleged to support a cognizable \n23  legal theory.  Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).   To defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) \n24  motion, plaintiffs must allege “more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the \n25  elements of a cause of action will not do”; instead, plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to “raise \n26  a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n27  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must assume the plaintiffs’ allegations of fact \n28  are true and must draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.  See Daniels-Hall v. National \n  5   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 11 of 19\n \n1  Educ. Ass’n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010).  However, “the tenet that a court must accept as \n2  true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  Ashcroft \n3  v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  While the court generally looks only to the face of the complaint and its \n4  exhibits, Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2002), the court \n5  may also consider documents that are proper subjects of judicial notice, Zucco Partners, LLC v. \n6  Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 991 (9th Cir. 2009).  Leave to amend need not be granted if “it is \n7  clear that the complaint could not be saved by an amendment.”  Livid Holdings Ltd. v. Salomon \n8  Smith Barney, Inc., 416 F.3d 940, 946 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n9  II.  PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT DOES NOT PRESENT A JUSTICIABLE CONTROVERSY. \n10  The Complaint should be dismissed as non-justiciable both because the claims alleged are \n11  now moot, and because plaintiffs failed to allege standing to bring those claims. \n12  “It is the inexorable command of the United States Constitution that the federal courts \n13  confine themselves to actual cases and controversies.  See U.S. CONST. art III, § 2, cl. 1.”  \n14  Gator.com Corp. v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 398 F.3d 1125, 1128 (9th Cir. 2005).  Article III requires that \n15  an actual controversy exist at all phases of the litigation.  Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. Brown, \n16  752 F.3d 827, 834 (9th Cir. 2014); Gator.com, 398 F.3d at 1128.  Thus, moot claims are not \n17  justiciable.  The court “loses its power to render a decision on the merits of a claim [citation], \n18  when [it] can no longer effectively remedy a ‘present controversy’ between the parties.”  \n19  Protectmarriage.com, 752 F.3d at 834.   \n20  Plaintiffs’ claims are now moot, because the primary election was concluded June 7.  All of \n21  plaintiffs’ allegations are based on events relating to the June 7, 2016 California primary.  See \n22  Complaint ¶¶ 4-5, 7-14, 16, 18-19.  Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and the relief they seek are specific \n23  to the election.  See supra Background Section III.E.  There is no justiciable controversy, because \n24  the Court is “unable to effectively remedy a present controversy between the parties where a \n25  plaintiff seeks to enjoin an activity that has already occurred, and [the court] cannot ‘undo’ that \n26  action’s allegedly harmful effects.”  Protectmarriage.com, 752 F.3d at 834.  \n27  The claims are also not justiciable because the plaintiffs have not alleged standing to bring \n28  them.  To establish standing, plaintiffs must show that: (1) they suffered an injury in fact – an \n  6   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 12 of 19\n \n1  invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or \n2  imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there is a causal connection between the injury and \n3  the conduct complained of; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury \n4  will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 \n5  (1992) (citations and quotations marks omitted).  Where an allegation of injury is conjectural or \n6  hypothetical and not clean-cut and concrete, concepts of standing and ripeness overlap and \n7  provide additional ground for dismissing a complaint.  Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d 1045, 1058 \n8  (9th Cir. 2010).  See Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998); Thomas v. Anchorage \n9  Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 11354, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).   \n10  To the extent the Complaint can be read to seek relief broader than that sought in \n11  connection with the June 7 primary, plaintiffs’ pleading at most alleges ephemeral, as opposed to \n12  concrete and particularized, injuries.  See Complaint ¶¶ 18-19, 27.  The injuries plaintiffs allege \n13  and the relief they seek are specific to the now-concluded June 7 primary election.  The claims of \n14  VRDP, Clara Daims, and Suzanne Bushnell are specific to the conduct impacting individual \n15  voters’ ability to vote for Bernie Sanders in the now-concluded primary election.  See id.  The \n16  American Independent Party alleges no injury, and can allege none, because at most it could \n17  claim some impact on crossover voting by no-party-preference voters who request an American \n18  Independent Party ballot, but there can be no certainty now that the American Independent Party \n19  will even permit crossover-voting in future presidential primary elections.  See CAL. ELEC. CODE \n20  § 13102(c) (political party may adopt party rule that authorizes no-party-preference voters “to \n21  vote the ballot of that political party at the next ensuing partisan primary election,” by providing \n22  “written notice . . . to the Secretary of State not later than the 135th day prior to [the election]).  \n23  Now that the 2016 primary election is concluded, any continuing threat would be purely \n24  hypothetical. \n25  III.  PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT DOES NOT STATE A CLAIM THAT IS FACTUALLY \nPLAUSIBLE. \n26 \n27  To survive a motion to dismiss, the Complaint must allege a claim that is facially plausible, \n28  that is, “‘the non-conclusory factual content,’ and reasonable inferences from that content, must \n  7   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 13 of 19\n \n1  be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief.”  Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 \n2  F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009).  “Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim . . . [is] \n3  a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and \n4  common sense.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n5  at 557.  Plaintiffs’ complaint simply does not plausibly suggest a claim entitling them to any \n6  relief.  Here, the Complaint alleges in general terms a “failure to inform NPP voters (no party \n7  preference voters) of their right to obtain a ‘crossover ballot’ and vote in the Presidential \n8  primary,” and an alleged “failure to inform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no \n9  party preference voters and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, \n10  American Independent, and Libertarian parties.”  Complaint ¶ 3.  These conclusory allegations do \n11  not plausibly state a claim for relief.   \n12  Indeed, plaintiffs’ complaint is devoid of meaningful factual allegations.  The prayer seeks \n13  a declaratory judgment that “Defendants’ challenge and removal procedures” violate the Voting \n14  Rights Act and the federal constitution, but the allegations of the complaint do not explain, \n15  describe, or even mention, any challenge and removal procedures, much less allege facts tending \n16  to show that any such procedures violate federal law.   \n17  Even if the Court were to overlook these fundamental problems, plaintiffs have not joined \n18  in this lawsuit 56 of the 58 county elections officials against whom plaintiffs seek injunctive \n19  relief.  Plaintiffs seek a broad injunction requiring specific actions in connection with a state-wide \n20  election that is run by local elections officials.  For example, Plaintiffs demand an order that all \n21  polling places have sufficient presidential primary ballots, that all county registrar websites be \n22  changed, and that the Court prescribe specific conduct by local poll workers throughout the state.  \n23  See Prayer to Complaint.  An injunction entered against the defendants in the lawsuit could not \n24  achieve this kind of local relief throughout the State.  See supra Background, Section I; CAL. \n25  Gov’t CODE § 12172.5(a). \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  8   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 14 of 19\n \n1  IV.  THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR VIOLATION OF THE FIRST OR \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs’ claims that party-affiliates must affirmatively be informed that they may re-\n4  register as no-party-preference voters, and that no-party-preference voters must be offered \n5  Democratic Party, American Independent Party, or Libertarian Party ballots by poll worker on \n6  Election Day, fail to state a claim as a matter of law.  These claims are effectively constitutional \n7  attacks on the Elections Code, which does not require such disclosures.  See CAL. ELEC. CODE §§ \n8  3006(c), 3205(b), 13102(b). \n9  These claims fail because the Constitution grants to the States “a broad power to prescribe \n10  the ‘Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,’ Art. I, § 4, \n11  cl. 1.”  Tashjian v. Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208, 217 (1986).  As a practical matter, elections \n12  cannot be conducted in the absence of extensive state regulation of the election process:  \n13  “Common sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must play \n14  an active role in structuring elections; ‘as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation \n15  of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to \n16  accompany the democratic processes.’”  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (quoting \n17  Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974)); accord, Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, \n18  520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997) (“States may, and inevitably must, enact reasonable regulations of \n19  parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election- and campaign-related disorder.”).   \n20  In elections cases, the Supreme Court has developed a balancing test to accommodate \n21  speech rights and a state’s interest in preserving fair and impartial elections.  First, a court “must \n22  weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the State’s rule imposes on those rights against \n23  the interests the State contends justify that burden, and consider the extent to which the State’s \n24  concerns make the burden necessary.”  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. at 358 \n25  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n26  Regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs’ rights must be narrowly tailored \nand advance a compelling state interest.  Lesser burdens, however, trigger less \n27  exacting review, and a State’s important regulatory interests will usually be enough to \njustify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.  . . . .  No bright line separates \n28 \n  9   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 15 of 19\n \n1  permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements on First \nAmendment freedoms. \n2 \n3  Id. at 358-359 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n4  As this Court has already held, plaintiffs’ allegations fail the Burdick balancing test.  \n5  Plaintiffs generally allege only that “the acts of the defendants’ toward no party preference voters \n6  constituted arbitrary discrimination of these plaintiffs as well as the associational classes that \n7  Voting Rights Defense Project and American Independent Party represent.”  Complaint ¶ 29.  As \n8  this Court has held: \n9  Here, the burden on no-party-preference voters, is slight, if it exists at all.  \nVoters must read the materials provided to them to understand their rights; only some \n10  counties will spoonfeed the information.  The government’s interest in arranging for \nan orderly and fair primary, avoiding confusion and providing too much information, \n11  and ensuring that voters can received their ballots in a timely manner all plainly \njustify defendants’ conduct. \n12 \n13  Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 4.2  The Complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a \n14  claim under the First or Fourteenth Amendments. \n15  V.  THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR VIOLATION OF THE VOTING \nRIGHTS ACT. \n16 \nA.  The Complaint Does Not State a Claim for Violation of Section \n17  10101(a)(2)(A) of the Voting Rights Act. \n18  Plaintiffs’ claim under 52 U.S.C. section 10101(a)(2)(A) fails as a matter of law.  That \n19  statute prohibits elections officials from discriminating between individuals within the same \n20  county or other political subdivision with respect to voter registration – in determining whether an \n21  individual is qualified to vote under state law.  As the Court has held, plaintiffs are not being \n22  denied the right to register to vote.  “Section 10101(a)(2)(A) concerns voter registration, which is \n23  not at issue here.”  Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 4. \n24 \n25 \n                                                           \n26  2 Simply treating no-party-preference voters differently from party-affiliated voters does \nnot allege a constitutional violation.  First Amendment associational rights allow the exclusion of \n27  no-party-preference voters from party primaries altogether.  California Democratic Party v. \nJones, 530 U.S. 567. 570-71, 575-76 (2000).  \n28 \n  10   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 16 of 19\n \n1  B.  The Complaint Does Not State a Claim for Violation of Section \n10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights Act. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs’ claim under section 10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights Act is similarly \n4  meritless.  Section 10101(a)(2)(B) prohibits a state from refusing to allow an individual to vote \n5  based on an immaterial error or omission in the registration application.  Friedman v. Snipes, 345 \n6  F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1370-73 (S.D. Fla. 2004).  This statute is wholly irrelevant to the petitioners’ \n7  claims.  Here, there is no allegation that any defendant has improperly rejected any application to \n8  register to vote or attempt to vote, much less that they have done so on the basis of an immaterial \n9  error or omission in the registration application.  The decision in Schwier v. Cox, 42 F. Supp. 2d \n10  1266 (N.D. Ga. 2005) is simply inapposite.  There the court held that the Voting Rights Act was \n11  violated when elections officials refuse to allow voters to register unless they provide social \n12  security numbers, which is information specifically protected from disclosure under federal law \n13  and immaterial to the voter registration process.   \n14  If plaintiffs are alleging that defendants have violated this section because they have not \n15  given no-party-preference voter information to party-affiliated voters, this would also fail to state \n16  a claim.  First, party-affiliated voters do not have a right to vote in any other party’s primary.  \n17  Second, there is no allegation in the complaint that any party-affiliated voter has been denied the \n18  right to vote.   Cf. Mem. Op. re Motion for Prelim. Inj. 4. \n19  VI.  PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS ALSO FAIL. \n20  A.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Mandamus Claims Based \non Alleged Violations of the Elections Code.  \n21 \n22  Alleged violations of the California Elections Code are set forth in plaintiffs’ “Fourth Cause \n23  of Action,” which seeks “mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1361.”  But, as this Court has held, \n24  section 1361 does not confer federal jurisdiction over mandamus claims against state officials.  \n25  Section 1361 provides:  “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the \n26  nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof \n27  to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  (Emphasis added); Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 4.  \n28  “[F]ederal district courts are without power to issue mandamus to direct state courts, state judicial \n  11   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 17 of 19\n \n1  officers, or other state officials in the performance of their duties.  A petition for a writ of \n2  mandamus to compel a state court or official to take or refrain from some action is frivolous as a \n3  matter of law.”  Todd v. McElhany, No. CIV S-11-2346 LKK, 2011 WL 5526464, at *2 (E.D. \n4  Cal. Nov. 14, 2011) (citing, inter alia, Demos v. U.S. District Court, 925 F.2d 1160, 1161 (9th \n5  Cir.1991), and Clark v. Washington, 366 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1966)).  \n6  B.  Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims Must Be Dismissed Because the Court May \nNot Enter an Injunction Based on Those Claims. \n7 \n8  Allowing plaintiffs to re-plead their state law claims as non-writ claims cannot save them.  \n9  The Complaint seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory \n10  relief is based only on plaintiffs’ Voting Rights Act and federal constitutional claims.  See \n11  Complaint at Prayer, Item 1.  The only relief plaintiffs seek on their Elections Code Claims is for \n12  an injunction.  See id. at Prayer, Items 2-9.  Even if the Court could otherwise exercise \n13  jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims, it cannot issue an injunction based on those \n14  claims. \n15  Federal courts should not intervene in state elections to decide issues of state law where no \n16  federal question is involved.  Curry v. Baker, 802 F.2d 1302, 1315 (11th Cir. 1986); Hubbard v. \n17  Ammerman, 465 F.2d 1168 (5th Cir. 1972).  And a federal court abuses its discretion if it enters \n18  any injunction that “requires any more of state officers than demanded by federal constitutional or \n19  statutory law.” Katie A. ex. rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007); \n20  Clark v. Coye, 60 F.3d 600, 604 (9th Cir. 1995).  See Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 5.  \n21  C.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint Fails to State a Claim for Violation of the California \nElections Code. \n22 \n23  Even if the Court could entertain plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims, which it cannot, they are \n24  insufficient as a matter of law.  The only factual allegation made against the Secretary in the \n25  complaint is a bare allegation, on information and belief, that “the Secretary of State failed \n26  properly to advise the other Defendants.”  Amended Complaint ¶ 15.  And the very next sentence \n27  concedes that the county defendants have “enormous autonomy” to run their affairs “free from \n28 \n  12   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 18 of 19\n \n1  interference from the Secretary.”  Id.  Although plaintiffs allege that the Secretary of State is an \n2  “indispensable party,” it is not clear what if any relief they are seeking from him. See id., Prayer.   \n3  If plaintiffs’ allegations are construed to allege that the Secretary of State is somehow \n4  responsible for any statutory violations by the county defendants, the allegations are insufficient \n5  as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs allege that the county defendants’ electronic voter registration \n6  applications violate Elections Code section 3006 and 3007.7 by not providing “mandatory notice \n7  to all voters of their right to state no party preference, and, further, that a no party preference \n8  voter shall be provided with Democratic, American Independent Party or Libertarian Party \n9  Presidential primary ballot”  Complaint ¶ 8.  But section 3006 and 3007 apply only to \n10  applications for a vote by mail ballot, and the applications are not required to include the notice \n11  language plaintiffs claim.  Section 3006 simply requires that the application  \n12  shall inform the voter that if he or she has declined to disclose a preference for a \npolitical party, the voter may request a vote by mail ballot for a particular political \n13  party for the partisan primary election, if that political party has adopted a party rule, \nduly noticed to the Secretary of State, authorizing that vote. . . .  The application shall \n14  contain a checkoff box with a conspicuously printed statement that reads substantially \nsimilar to the following: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified \n15  political party.  However, for this primary election only, I request a vote by mail \nballot for the __________ Party.”  The name of the political party shall be personally \n16  affixed by the voter. \n17  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3006 (emphasis added).   \n18  Plaintiffs’ allegations that the county defendants violated Elections Code section 3006 “by \n19  preparing the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample Ballot in a non-uniform manner” also fails \n20  as a matter of law.  Preliminarily, section 3006 sets forth requirements for voter registration \n21  applications, not voter information pamphlets and sample ballots.  The Secretary is required to \n22  prepare a uniform application format for a vote by mail ballot, CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3007, and the \n23  Complaint concedes that the Secretary of State did so.  Complaint ¶ 10..  However, the statute \n24  expressly provides that “[t]he uniform format need not be utilized by elections officials in \n25  preparing a vote by mail voter’s ballot application to be included with the sample ballot.”  Id. \n26  In short, even if the Court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ purported Elections Code claims, \n27  which it does not, they fail as a matter of law. \n28 \n  13   \nDefendant Secretary of State’s Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 48   Filed 06/14/16   Page 19 of 19\n \n1  VII.  THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. \n2  Leave to amend a defective complaint need not be granted if “it is clear that the complaint \n3  could not be saved by an amendment.”  Livid Holdings Ltd. v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., 416 \n4  F.3d at 946.  As demonstrated above, plaintiffs cannot cure the defects in their complaint by \n5  amendment. \n6  CONCLUSION \n7  The Court should dismiss the Complaint with prejudice. \n8  Dated:  June 14, 2016  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \n9  KAMALA D.

On the eve of the California primary election, Plaintiffs have sued the \n4  California Secretary of State and two county elections officials.  By their motion Plaintiffs ask the \n5  Court to give them, on an emergency basis, an injunction that would include: \n6  •  An order requiring day-of-voting registration, a program that under California law \n7  will not be operational until 2018, and logistically could not be implemented for an \n8  election that will occur in less than one week;  \n9  •  An order directing “all poll workers” to provide voters with certain information \n10  that, while a practice encouraged as part of the State’s goal of providing voters with \n11  a positive Election Day experience, is not a requirement of the Elections Code; and \n12  •  An order requiring “public service announcements,” that, to the extent relevant or \n13  accurate, add nothing to massive voter outreach that the Secretary has made and is \n14  continuing to make with respect to the upcoming election, \n15  In addition, Plaintiffs ask the Court to order unspecified parties, but presumably county registrars \n16  of voters across the state, to comply with Elections Code requirements concerning provision of \n17  ballots at polling places, where Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that the county elections \n18  officials intend to do anything less than their legal duties.1   \n19  Changing the rules in the middle of an election is unfair to the voters, candidates and \n20  elections officials, but more importantly, it threatens the integrity of the election process.  And \n21  last minute requests for extraordinary relief distract from the work that must be done in the few \n22  days that remain before the election.  \n23  Plaintiffs’ motion – and this lawsuit – is frivolous.  The motion should be denied.  \n24 \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiffs’ motion omits a proposed order, required by Local Rule 7-2(c), so the precise \n27 \nrelief they seek is not clear. \n28 \n  1   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 10 of 26\n \n1  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n2  The presidential primary election in California is set for June 7, 2016, a date established in \n3  California Elections Code section 340.  The last day to register to vote, or to re-register to vote to \n4  change parties or to become a no party preference (NPP) voter, was May 23, 2016.  Military and \n5  overseas ballots were sent out between April 8 and April 23, 2016.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3105.  \n6  Vote-by-mail voting has been going on for weeks.  Id. § 3001.   \n7  The vote by mail applications include language advising NPP voters of their right to request \n8  a primary ballot for those political parties that have opted to allow NPP voters to participate in \n9  their primary elections.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3006(c).  In addition to printed vote by mail \n10  applications, local elections officials may, but are not required to, offer an electronic vote by mail \n11  application.  Voters also may establish permanent vote by mail voter status.  Id. § 3201.  Prior to \n12  every partisan primary election, county elections officials are required to send out a notice and \n13  application to every NPP voter who is also a permanent vote-by-mail voter, informing the voter \n14  “that he or she may request a vote by mail ballot for a particular party for the primary election, if \n15  that political party adopted a party rule” allowing NPP voters to vote in their primary.  Id. \n16  § 3205(b).  The accompanying application allows the NPP voter to write in the political party \n17  ballot he or she wishes to receive.  Id.   \n18  Plaintiffs filed this action on May 20, 2016.2  The Complaint alleges violations of the \n19  Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United \n20  States Constitution.  In addition, the Complaint contains a claim for writ of mandamus under \n21  28 U.S.C. § 1361, based on Defendants’ alleged violations of the California Elections Code.  On \n22  the evening of May 27, 2016, one week after the action was filed and less than two weeks before \n23  the presidential primary, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, and requested an \n24  expedited hearing.3   \n25                                                             \n2 Plaintiffs served the complaint on the Secretary of State on May 24, 2016. \n26  3 Plaintiffs’ notice of motion omitted the memorandum of points and authorities that is \nrequired to be included in the motion under Local Rule 7-2(b)(4).  This Court entered a \n27  scheduling order that required Plaintiffs to serve all Defendants with the motion and all \nsupporting papers no later than 4:00 p.m. on May 28, 2016.  Just before 4:00 p.m. Plaintiffs filed \n28  (continued…) \n  2   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 11 of 26\n \n1  LEGAL STANDARD \n2  “‘[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \n3  granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.’”  Mazurek v. \n4  Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (citation omitted).  A Plaintiff seeking a preliminary \n5  injunction must satisfy a four-part test set out by the United States Supreme Court in Winter v. \n6  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  That is, it must “establish \n7  [1] that he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \n8  absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an \n9  injunction is in the public interest.”  Id.; see Farris v. Seabrook, 677 F.3d 858, 864 (9th Cir. \n10  2012).  \n11  Further, the primary purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo while \n12  a case is decided on the merits.  Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Court., 840 F.2d 701, 704 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n13  While a prohibitory injunction preserves the status quo, a mandatory injunction “goes well \n14  beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite [and] is particularly disfavored.”  Stanley \n15  v. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, 1320 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted).  When a party requests a \n16  mandatory preliminary injunction, “the district court should deny such relief ‘unless the facts and \n17  law clearly favor the moving party.’”  Id.

Riles, 502 F.2d \n2  963, 965 (9th Cir. 1974). \n3  A plaintiffs’ evidentiary burden in seeking provisional relief in advance of trial is more \n4  rigorous when the plaintiff seeks to enjoin governmental action taken in the public interest \n5  pursuant to statutory provisions.  Midgett v. Tri-County Metro. Transp. Dist., 254 F.3d 846, 851 \n6  (9th Cir. 2001); see also Thomas v. County of Los Angeles, 978 F.2d 504, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n7  Thus, “[a] strong factual record is therefore necessary before a federal district court may enjoin a \n8  State agency.”  Cupolo v. Bay Area Rapid Transit, 5 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1085 (N.D. Cal. 1997) \n9  (citing Thomas, 978 F.3d at 508).  Moreover, “it is clear that a state suffers irreparable injury \n10  whenever an enactment of its people or their representatives is enjoined.”  Coalition for Economic \n11  Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 718, 719 (9th Cir. 1997).  Thus, “a federal court must exercise \n12  restraint when a plaintiff seeks to enjoin any non-federal government agency, be it local or state.”  \n13  Midgett, 254 F.3d at 851.   \n14  Finally, a federal court may not enjoin a state agency based on an alleged violation of state \n15  law.  The court will be deemed to have abused its discretion if its injunction “require[s] more of \n16  state officials than is necessary to ensure their compliance with federal law.”  Clark v. Coye, 60 \n17  F.3d 600, 604 (9th Cir. 1995); See Trueblood v. Wash. State Dept. of Social & Health Servs.,  \n18  -- F.3d --, No. 15-35462, 2016 WL 2610233 (9th Cir., May 6 2016); Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. Los \n19  Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007).  \n20  ARGUMENT \n21  I.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE NO LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. \n22  The first element in Winter’s four-factor test for determining whether a preliminary \n23  injunction should issue, and the most important, is whether Plaintiffs can show they are likely to \n24  succeed on the merits of their claim.  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015).  \n25  “Because it is a threshold inquiry, when ‘a plaintiff has failed to show the likelihood of success \n26  on the merits, [the court] need not consider the remaining three [Winter elements]’.”  Id. (quoting \n27  Ass’n des Eleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du Quebec v. Harris, 729 F.3d 937 (9th Cir. 2013).  \n28  Here, Plaintiffs’ burden is “doubly demanding” because they are seeking a mandatory injunction, \n  4   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 13 of 26\n \n1  and therefore “must establish that the law and facts clearly favor [their] position.”  Id.  This, \n2  Plaintiffs have not done.  \n3  A.  Plaintiffs’ Cannot Prevail on Their Complaint, Which Does Not State a \nClaim on Which Relief May Be Granted. \n4 \nTo state a claim on which Plaintiffs could be entitled to relief, their complaint4 must state a \n5 \nclaim that is facially plausible, that is, “‘the non-conclusory factual content,’ and reasonable \n6 \ninferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the Plaintiff to \n7 \nrelief.”  Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009).  “Determining whether a \n8 \ncomplaint states a plausible claim . . . [is] a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court \n9 \nto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 622, 670 \n10 \n(2009); see Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007).  Plaintiffs’ complaint simply \n11 \ndoes not plausibly suggest a claim entitling them to any federal court relief.  Here, the Complaint \n12 \nalleges in general terms a “failure to inform NPP voter (no party preference voters) of their right \n13 \nto obtain a ‘crossover ballot’ and vote in the Presidential primary,” and an alleged “failure to \n14 \ninform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no party preference voters and still \n15 \nreceive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, American Independent, and \n16 \nLibertarian parties.”  Complaint ¶ 3. This does not plausibly state a claim for relief.  See Swann v. \n17 \nSecretary, 668 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir. 2012) (inmate lacked standing to bring 1983 claim  \n18 \nbased on elections officials’ failure to send absentee ballot to inmate’s jail address where inmate \n19 \ndid not request that the ballot be sent there).  At the threshold, no preliminary injunction should \n20 \nbe entered based on a facially defective complaint.     \n21 \nIndeed, Plaintiffs’ complaint is unintelligible.  Their prayer seeks a declaratory judgment \n22 \nthat “Defendants’ challenge and removal procedures” violate the Voting Rights Act and the \n23 \nfederal constitution, but the allegations of the complaint do not explain, describe, or even \n24 \nmention, any challenge and removal procedures, much less allege facts showing that any such \n25 \nprocedures violate federal law.5   \n26 \n                                                           \n4 All references herein are to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint. \n27 \n5 Plaintiffs have asked the Court to allow them to amend the complaint to conform to \n28  (continued…) \n  5   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 14 of 26\n \n1  Moreover, the Complaint is insufficient to show standing.  In order to have standing, \n2  Plaintiffs must show “first, a ‘distinct and palpable’ injury to the plaintiff, be it ‘threatened or \n3  actual’; second, a ‘fairly traceable causal connection’ between that injury and the challenged \n4  conduct of the defendants; and third, a ‘substantial likelihood’ that the relief requested will \n5  redress or prevent the injury.”  Olagues v. Russoniello, 770 F.2d 791, 796 (9th Cir. 1985) \n6  (quoting McMichael v. County of Napa, 709 F.2d 1268, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 1983).  Similarly, “[a] \n7  claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as \n8  anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”  Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998); \n9  Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 11354, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).  Except for \n10  vague and sweeping generalizations, Plaintiffs have failed to plead, much less prove, any \n11  threatened or actual injury. \n12  Even if the Court were to overlook these fundamental problems, Plaintiffs have not joined \n13  in this lawsuit 56 of the 58 county elections officials against whom Defendants seek injunctive \n14  relief.  Plaintiffs seek a broad injunction requiring specific actions in connection with a state-wide \n15  election that is run by local elections officials.  See Motion at 2-3; Prayer to Amended \n16  Complaint.6  \n17  Plaintiffs’ complaint, even taken as true, does not state a claim on which any relief may be \n18  granted, let alone the extraordinary remedy of a mandatory injunction that would provide \n19  Plaintiffs the ultimate relief they seek in the action.    \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                           \n(…continued) \n23  proof, but their evidence adds nothing to their allegations.   \n6 Plaintiffs do not allege that the Secretary controls local election officials, and indeed the \n24 \nComplaint concedes that he does not.  Complaint ¶ 15.  Thus Plaintiffs’ reliance on Wash. Ass’n \nof Churches v. Reed, 492 F. Supp. 2d 1264 (W.D. Wash. 2006), which involved a statute that \n25 \ngave the Washington Secretary of State “the authority to instruct and compel county election \nofficial to comply with the laws, rules and guidelines governing elections,” and in which \n26 \nPlaintiffs were seeking to enjoin an election-related statute, is misplaced.  An injunction directed \nto the Secretary cannot impose mandates on county election officials who are not parties to this \n27 \nlitigation.   \n28 \n  6   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 15 of 26\n \n1  B.  In Particular, Plaintiffs Have No Likelihood of Succeeding on the Merits of \nTheir Federal Claims. \n2 \n1.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their First and Fourteenth \n3  Amendments claims. \n4  a.  The Elections Code does not violate the First or Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n5 \n6  At least some of Plaintiffs’ allegations appear to be an attack on the Elections Code, since \n7  Plaintiffs complain, for example, that party-affiliates must affirmatively be informed that they \n8  may re-register as NPP voters, and that NPP voters must be offered Democratic, American \n9  Independent Party or Peace and Freedom ballots by poll worker on Election Day, neither of \n10  which is a requirement of the Elections Code.  See CAL. ELEC. CODE §§ 3006(c), 3205(b), \n11  13102(b). \n12  The Constitution grants to the States “a broad power to prescribe the ‘Times, Places and \n13  Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,’ Art. I, § 4, cl. 1.”  Tashjian v. \n14  Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208, 217 (1986).  As a practical matter, elections \n15  cannot be conducted in the absence of extensive state regulation of the election process:  \n16  “Common sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must play \n17  an active role in structuring elections; ‘as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation \n18  of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to \n19  accompany the democratic processes.’”  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (quoting \n20  Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974)); accord, Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, \n21  520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997) (“States may, and inevitably must, enact reasonable regulations of \n22  parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election- and campaign-related disorder.”).   \n23  In elections cases, the Supreme Court has developed a balancing test to accommodate \n24  speech rights and a State’s interest in preserving fair and impartial elections.  First, a court must \n25  weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the State’s rule imposes on those rights against \n26  the interests the State contends justify that burden, and consider the extent to which the State’s \n27  concerns make the burden necessary.”  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, \n28  358 (citations and internal quotations omitted).   \n  7   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 16 of 26\n \n1  Regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs’ rights must be narrowly \ntailored and advance a compelling state interest.  Lesser burdens, however, trigger \n2  less exacting review, and a State’s important regulatory interests will usually be \nenough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.  . . . .  No bright line \n3  separates permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements \non First Amendment freedoms. \n4 \n5  Timmons, 520 U.S. at 358-359 (citations and internal quotations omitted).   \n6  Plaintiffs’ complaint contains only a general allegation, quoted in Plaintiffs’ Amended \n7  Memorandum, that “the acts of the defendants’ toward no party preference voters constituted \n8  arbitrary discrimination of these plaintiffs as well as the associational classes that Voting Rights \n9  Defense Project and American Independent Party represent.”  Complaint ¶ 29; Amended \n10  Memorandum at 9.  Plaintiffs do not explain why the First or Fourteenth Amendment is violated \n11  by imposing on an NPP voter the de minimis burden of having to request a party presidential \n12  primary ballot, or how a party-affiliated voter is unduly burdened because the state does not \n13  affirmatively notify that voter that he or she will have to re-register to vote if he or she wishes to \n14  vote for a candidate of another political party.   \n15  Simply treating NPP voters differently from party voters is not a constitutional violation.7   \n16  b.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on claims of election fraud. \n17  To the extent Plaintiffs’ claims can be construed as claims for election fraud, Plaintiffs still \n18  cannot prevail on their First and Fourteenth Amendment claims.  A violation of federal \n19  constitutional law under section 1983 requires “willful conduct” that “undermines the organic \n20  processes by which candidates are elected.” Kozuszek v. Brewer, 546 F.3d 485, 488 (7th Cir. \n21  2008); Broyles v. Texas, 618 F. Supp. 2d  661, 694 (S.D. Tex. 2009).  A violation exists only \n22  when election irregularities implicate “the very integrity of the electoral process,” and “reach a \n23  point of patent and fundamental unfairness.”  Welch v. McKenzie, 756 F.2d 1311, 1314 (5th Cir. \n24  1985).     \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n7 In fact, First Amendment associational rights allow the exclusion of NPP voters from \n27  party primaries altogether.  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567. 570-71, 575-76 \n(2000).  \n28 \n  8   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 17 of 26\n \n1  Nothing in the complaint or Plaintiffs’ evidence suggests purposeful or systematic \n2  discriminatory conduct.  At the most generous, Plaintiffs’ claims could be construed as alleging \n3  isolated incidents of election irregularity, which are not sufficient to support a claim under section \n4  1983.  “Garden variety” irregularities such as miscounting votes, counting votes illegally cast, \n5  arbitrarily rejecting certain ballots, or providing incorrect information to individual voters are not \n6  enough to implicate section 1983, see Broyles, 618 F. Supp. 2d at 694 (collecting cases cited \n7  therein), and Plaintiffs’ allegations do not rise even to this level.  For example, in Broyles, the \n8  court concluded that poll officials’ failure on scores of occasions to offer a provisional ballots and \n9  their provision of inaccurate information about the ballot did not violate section 1983.  Id.  Here, \n10  Plaintiffs’ main complaint is that Defendants did not do enough – in Plaintiffs’ view – to make \n11  voters aware of laws that the voters are already presumed to know.   See In re Estate of Haskell, \n12  92 Cal.App.4th 966, 973 (2001); In re Town of Sitka, 11 Alaska 201, 208 (1946).  They have \n13  neither alleged nor proffered evidence of any discriminatory intent.  None of the declarations \n14  Plaintiffs have submitted in support of their claim indicate systematic discriminatory conduct; \n15  indeed, none of those declarations establish that anyone actually has been denied the right to \n16  register to vote or to vote.8   \n17  2.  Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of prevailing on their Voting \nRights Act claims. \n18 \na.  Plaintiffs have not alleged or shown a race or minority \n19  discrimination motive or result. \n20  The Voting Rights Act was intended to eliminate racial discrimination in voting \n21  requirements.  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47 (1986); Smith v. Salt River Project Agric. \n22  Improvement & Power Dist., 109 F.3d 586, 595 (9th Cir. 1997) (in determining whether \n23  challenged voting practice violates Voting Rights Act a court must determine whether the process \n24  is equally open to minority voters).  Plaintiffs do not and cannot allege that the alleged \n25 \n                                                           \n8 Many of the declarants reported incidents that do not involved any conduct of the \n26 \nSecretary of State or the San Francisco or Alameda elections officials.  Any claims against the \nelections officials in Monterey, Orange, San Diego or any other county would have to be asserted \n27 \nin an action against those persons. \n28 \n  9   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 18 of 26\n \n1  wrongdoing is tied to “social and historical conditions,” for example, that “cause an inequality in \n2  the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.”  \n3  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47 (1986); see Southwest Voter Registration Educ. Project v. \n4  Shelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003).  Plaintiffs do not purport to identify the alleged injury \n5  with any particular race or minority group.  See Smith v. Salt River Project, 109 F.3d 586, 595 \n6  (9th Cir. 1997).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims under the Voting Rights Act fail.  \n7  b.  Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of success on their claims \nbased on 52 U.S.C. section 10101(a)(2)(A). \n8 \nEven if Plaintiffs could overcome the threshold defect in their Voting Rights Claim – that  \n9 \nthey have neither alleged or proved injury to a particular race of minority group – Plaintiffs’ \n10 \nclaim under 52 U.S.C. section 10101(a)(2)(A) would fail.  That statute prohibits elections \n11 \nofficials from discriminating between individuals within the same county or other political \n12 \nsubdivision with respect to voter registration – in determining whether an individual is qualified \n13 \nto vote under state law.  Plaintiffs are not being denied the right to register to vote.  Section \n14 \n10101(a)(2)(A) does not require that elections officials provide voters differently situated with the \n15 \nsame information.     \n16 \nc.  Plaintiffs’ have no likelihood of prevailing on their 52 U.S.C. \n17  section 10101(a)(2)(B) claims. \n18 \nPlaintiffs’ claim under section 10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights Act is meritless.  \n19 \nSection 10101(a)(2)(B) prohibits a state from refusing to allow an individual to register to vote \n20 \nbased on an immaterial error or omission in the registration application.  Friedman v. Snipes, 345 \n21 \nF. Supp. 2d  1356, 1370-73 (S.D. Fla. 2004).   This statute is wholly irrelevant to the petitioners’ \n22 \nclaims in this case.  There is no allegation in the Complaint that any of the Defendants have \n23 \nimproperly rejected any application to register to vote, much less that they have done so on the \n24 \nbasis of an immaterial error or omission in the registration application.  The decision in Schwier \n25 \nv. Cox, 42 F. Supp. 2d 1266 (N.D. Ga. 2005), in which the court held that the Voting Rights Act \n26 \nwas violated when elections officials refuse to allow voters to register unless they provide social \n27 \n28 \n  10   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 19 of 26\n \n1  security numbers – information protected from disclosure under federal law and immaterial to the \n2  voter registration process – is simply inapposite. \n3  C.  Plaintiffs Likewise Have No Likelihood of Succeeding on the Merits of \nTheir California Elections Code Claims. \n4 \n1.  Plaintiffs’ state Elections Code claims cannot support the requested \n5  injunction. \n6  a.  This Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ Elections Code \nMandamus Claims. \n7 \n8  Plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims are set forth in Plaintiffs’ “Fourth Cause of Action,” \n9  which seeks “mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1361.”  This Court lacks jurisdiction over that \n10  mandamus claim.  Section 1361 provides:  “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of \n11  any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or \n12  any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the Plaintiff.”  (Emphasis added.)  It does not give \n13  federal courts mandamus jurisdiction over state officials.  “[F]ederal district courts are without \n14  power to issue mandamus to direct state courts, state judicial officers, or other state officials in \n15  the performance of their duties.  A petition for a writ of mandamus to compel a state court or \n16  official to take or refrain from some action is frivolous as a matter of law.”  Todd v. McElhany, \n17  No. CIV S-11-2346 LKK, 2011 WL 5526464, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2011) (citing, inter alia, \n18  Demos v. U.S. District Court, 925 F.2d 1160, 1161 (9th Cir.1991), and Clark v. Washington, 366 \n19  F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1966)).  \n20  b.  The Court may not enter an injunction based on Plaintiffs’ \nElections Code claims. \n21 \n22  Even if the Court could exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims, those \n23  claims cannot support the injunction Plaintiffs seek.  The federal courts should not intervene in \n24  state elections to decide issues of state law where no federal question is involved.  Curry v. Baker, \n25  802 F.2d 1302, 1315 (11th Cir. 1986); Hubbard v. Ammerman, 465 F.2d 1168 (5th Cir. 1972).  \n26  And a federal court abuses its discretion if it enters any injunction – much less a preliminary \n27  injunction – that “requires any more of state officers than demanded by federal constitutional or \n28 \n  11   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 20 of 26\n \n1  statutory law.” Katie A. ex. rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d at 1155; Clark v. Coye, 60 \n2  F.3d at 604 (9th Cir. 1995).  Thus Plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims are legally insufficient. \n3  2.  Even if the Court properly could consider Plaintiffs’ Elections Code \nclaims, Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of succeeding on them. \n4 \n5  Even if the Court were to consider Plaintiffs’ state law claims, which it should not, \n6  Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on them, much less that the law and facts \n7  clearly favor their position, which is their burden.  See Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d at 740.   \n8  a.  The requested injunction should be denied under the doctrine \nof laches. \n9 \n10  Plaintiffs have waited too long to assert their claims, to Defendants’ prejudice.  The Voter \n11  Information Guide went through a public review period from February 23, 2016 to March 14, \n12  2016, during which time anyone seeking to challenge its content could have filed a petition for \n13  writ of mandamus.

The application \n15  to vote by mail has been posted to the Secretary of State website since 2002.  Reyes Declaration \n16  ¶ 22 & Exs. S & T.  Nothing in Plaintiffs’ complaint suggests that Plaintiffs did not discover, and \n17  could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence have discovered, the alleged problems long ago.9   \n18  Yet Plaintiffs waited until just days before the election before filing this action, and \n19  inexplicably delayed a week after filing this action before seeking their motion for an injunction.  \n20  The Secretary of State has been, and is continuing to engage in, appropriate outreach efforts.  \n21  Reyes Declaration ¶¶ 2-21, 23 & Exs. A-Q.  Plaintiffs’ own evidence indicates that many, if not \n22  most, poll workers have already been trained for their Election Day duties.  The last day to \n23  register to vote has passed, and the last day to request a vote by mail ballot will have passed, \n24  before this motion is heard.  Re-opening registration to allow voting through June 7, 2016 would \n25  violate Elections Code sections 2102 and 2107.  Moreover, it is simply not logistically possible.  \n26 \n                                                           \n9 The fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel claim to have only recently learned of alleged problems \n27 \nis irrelevant.  \n28 \n  12   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 21 of 26\n \n1  See Declaration of Susan Lapsley in Opposition to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Lapsley \n2  Declaration) ¶¶ 2-12.  Same day conditional voting will be possible in California on January 1 of \n3  the year following the year California has fully deployed the uniform, centralized statewide voter \n4  registration database required by the Help America Vote Act, 52 U.S.C. section 21083.  See 2012 \n5  Cal. Stat. Ch. 497 (Assembly Bill 1436); CAL. ELEC. CODE §§ 2170-2173.  But that deployment is \n6  not yet complete.  Lapsley Declaration ¶¶ 5-7.      \n7  “Under the equitable doctrine of laches, the Court may deny an injunction to a plaintiff who \n8  fails diligently to assert his claim. ‘Laches requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party \n9  against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.’”  \n10  Southwest Voter Registration Project v. Shelley, 278 F. Supp. 2d 1131, 1137-38 (C.D. Cal. 2003) \n11  (quoting Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265, 282 (1961)).10  Here, the requirements for \n12  laches – lack of diligence on Plaintiffs’ part and prejudice to Defendants – have been met. \n13  b.  Plaintiffs have not shown a violation of the Elections Code. \n14  Plaintiffs’ Elections Code claims also fail on the merits.  The only factual allegation made \n15  against the Secretary in the complaint is a bare allegation, on information and belief, that “the \n16  Secretary of State failed properly to advise the other Defendants.”  Amended Complaint ¶ 15.  \n17  And the very next sentence concedes that the county Defendants have “enormous autonomy” to \n18  run their affairs “free from interference from the Secretary.”  Id.  Although Plaintiffs allege that \n19  the Secretary of State is an “indispensable party,” it is not clear what if any relief they are seeking \n20  from him. See id., Prayer; Amended Memorandum at 2-4.  \n21  Plaintiffs argue that the county Defendants’ electronic voter registration applications violate \n22  Elections Code section 3006 and 3007.7 by not providing “mandatory notice to all voters of their \n23  right to state no party preference, and, further, that a no party preference voter shall be provided \n24  with Democratic, American Independent Party or Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot”  \n25  Complaint ¶ 8.  But section 3006 and 3007 apply only to applications for a vote by mail ballot, \n26 \n                                                           \n10 The district court decision in Southwest was reversed by a panel of the Ninth Circuit, \n27  344 F.3d 882 (2003).  On rehearing en banc the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court decision, \nbut did not address the laches issue.  344 F.3d 914 (2003).  \n28 \n  13   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 22 of 26\n \n1  and the applications are not required to include the notice language Plaintiffs claim.  Section 3006 \n2  simply requires that the application  \n3  shall inform the voter that if he or she has declined to disclose a preference for a \npolitical party, the voter may request a vote by mail ballot for a particular political \n4  party for the partisan primary election, if that political party has adopted a party rule, \nduly noticed to the Secretary of State, authorizing that vote. . . .  The application shall \n5  contain a checkoff box with a conspicuously printed statement that reads substantially \nsimilar to the following: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified \n6  political party.  However, for this primary election only, I request a vote by mail \nballot for the __________ Party.”  The name of the political party shall be personally \n7  affixed by the voter. \n8  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3006 (emphasis added).  The Secretary of State has done much more than the \n9  statute requires.  He has engaged in extensive outreach to inform all voters about their ability to \n10  register as NPP voters and to vote in a primary election for a party that allows NPP voters to do \n11  so.  Reyes Declaration ¶¶ 2-21 and Exs. A-R.  And it is worth noting that county elections \n12  officials are not required to provide electronic vote by mail applications at all.  The Elections \n13  Code merely gives the local elections officials the option to do so.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3007.7(a) \n14  (“The local elections official may offer a voter the ability to electronically apply for a vote by \n15  mail voter’s ballot.” (emphasis added)).  If Plaintiffs could show a problem with the electronic \n16  applications, the remedy would simply be to remove that option, and require all voters to use a \n17  printed application.  \n18   Although not pleaded in the Complaint, Plaintiffs’ motion appears to argue that the \n19  Elections Code requires that all poll workers must inform NPP voters of the right to receive a \n20  presidential ballot, and that the failure of some poll workers to do so would violate the Elections \n21  Code.  Motion at 3.  Plaintiffs are simply incorrect.  Elections Code section 13102(b) states “At \n22  partisan primary elections, each voter not registered disclosing a preference with any one of the \n23  political parties participating in an election shall be furnished only a nonpartisan ballot, unless he \n24  or she requests a ballot of a political party and that political party, by party rule duly noticed to \n25  the Secretary of State, authorizes a person who has declined to disclose a party preference to vote \n26  the ballot of that political party.”  (Emphasis added.)   The Secretary of State’s poll workers \n27  instruction guide encourages poll workers to affirmatively ask NPP voters if they wish to request \n28  a party presidential ballot.  But the fact that the Secretary of State encourages, and elections \n  14   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 23 of 26\n \n1  officials may choose to instruct poll workers to do more than is legally required does not mean \n2  that a failure to do so a violation of the Elections Code.11 \n3  Plaintiffs’ argument that the county Defendants violated Elections Code section 3006 “by \n4  preparing the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample Ballot in a non-uniform manner” also \n5  fails.  Preliminarily, section 3006 sets forth requirements for voter registration applications, not \n6  voter information pamphlets and sample ballots.  The Secretary of State is required to, and did, \n7  prepare a uniform application format for a vote by mail ballot.  CAL. ELEC. CODE § 3007.  \n8  However, the statute expressly provides that “[t]he uniform format need not be utilized by \n9  elections officials in preparing a vote by mail voter’s ballot application to be included with the \n10  sample ballot.”  Id. \n11  Neither the Complaint nor Plaintiffs’ motion includes any factual basis for Plaintiffs’ \n12  request for an injunction order “[e]nsuring that sufficient ballots forms for all of the Presidential \n13  primary candidates are at all of the polling places on June 7.”  Complaint, Prayer.  The Elections \n14  Code contains specific provisions relating to ballots, CAL. ELEC. CODE § 14102, 14299, and \n15  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants have violated, or have threatened to violate, these \n16  provisions. Due to the heightened interest in this election, the Secretary of State has urged county \n17  elections officials to ensure polling places have ample ballots, and has reminded them of their \n18  statutory obligation to have alternative procedures in place in the event there are insufficient \n19  ballots at a precinct.  Reyes Declaration ¶¶ 19-20 & Exs. P, Q.  There is no basis for presuming \n20  that Defendants will not properly perform their legal duties.  See CAL. EVID. CODE § 664.      \n21  Finally, in support of their motion, Plaintiffs have filed declarations by individuals who \n22  complain about individual incidents involving elections officials who are not parties to this action.  \n23  See Declaration of Mark Seidenberg.  While the Secretary of State is not in a position to address \n24  factual allegations pertaining to events in which the Secretary of State’s Office was not involved, \n                                                           \n25  11 Plaintiffs own evidence shows that several counties instruct poll workers to \naffirmatively ask NPP voters if they wish to receive a party ballot.  See, e.g., Ex. 3 to Declaration \n26  of Ashkey Beck (Doc. ## 22, 22-1, 23) (Beck Declaration), Doc # 25 at 35,  Doc # 25-1 at 85, \nDoc # 25-2 (Orange County); Declaration of Michelle M. Jenab, Doc. # 26-2 (Jenab Declaration) \n27  (Los Angeles County); Declaration  of Mimi Kennedy (Doc. # 26-1) (Kennedy Declaration) ¶ 7 \n(Los Angeles County). \n28 \n  15   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 24 of 26\n \n1  it appears that, of those described with sufficient detail to be understood, most of the incidents \n2  were either resolved or simply reflect Plaintiffs’ misinterpretations of the elections laws.  None \n3  indicate that any County is engaged in elections misconduct. \n4  In short, even if Plaintiffs’ purported Elections Code claims were relevant to this \n5  proceeding, and they are not, they fail on the merits. \n6  II.  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT ESTABLISH IRREPARABLE INJURY \n7  Because Plaintiffs have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court \n8  need not consider the other elements of the four-part test in Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Garcia v. \n9  Google, Inc., 786 F.3d at 740; Ass’n des Eleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du Quebec v. Harris, 729 \n10  F.3d at 944.  Plaintiffs’ alleged harm is described primarily in terms of abstract speculation – the \n11  individual Plaintiffs might be denied a “Presidential party ballot for Bernie Sanders.”  Complaint \n12  ¶¶ 18-19.12  Plaintiffs also imply that some NPP voters might not be aware that they can \n13  personally deliver their application to vote by mail to the county board of elections office by May \n14  31, 2016, and that some “party-affiliated voters” might  be unaware that they can re-register as \n15  NPP voters and receive a Democratic Party primary ballot.  See Complaint ¶¶ 3-4. The American \n16  Independent Party does not allege that it has or will suffer any harm.13  Under California law, “[i]t \n17  is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.”  CAL. EVID. CODE § 664.  Plaintiffs \n18  have proffered nothing to rebut the presumption that Defendants have and will follow the law in \n19  connection with the June 7, 2016 presidential primary.  Plaintiffs’ declarations describing alleged \n20  voter confusion, even if accepted, is not irreparable harm.  The Secretary of State has widely \n21  disseminated information fully informing NPP voters of their right to receive a presidential ballot.  \n22 \n                                                           \n12 Indeed, Ms. Bushnell is a registered Democrat who speculates that if she decides to \n23  change to a no party preference voter right before the presidential primary, she might be denied a \nballot of the Democratic slate.  The notion of filing a federal lawsuit ostensibly to preserve the \n24  option to disassociate oneself from the Democratic Party so as to be able to vote in the \nDemocratic presidential primary as an NPP voter piles speculation upon speculation.  Moreover, \n25  the time to do so has passed; the deadline to change party affiliation or to register was May 23. \n13 The American Independent Party has been a registered political party for more \n26 \nthan 40 years.  See CAL. ELEC. CODE  §§ 7500, 6500-6524 (enacted by Stats. 1994, Ch. 920, Sec. \n2).  The Complaint contains no hint as to why the American Independent Party suddenly has a \n27 \nproblem with the election process this year.  \n28 \n  16   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 25 of 26\n \n1  Reyes Declaration ¶¶ 2-21 and Exs. A-R.  Plaintiffs have not established any harm, much less \n2  irreparable harm. \n3  III.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS AND PUBLIC INTEREST OVERWHELMINGLY WEIGH \nAGAINST THE REQUESTED TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. \n4 \n5  The harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest, “merge when the \n6  Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Granting \n7  Plaintiffs the relief they seek of ordering voter registration to be reopened cannot be achieved in \n8  time for the June 7 election, and would be costly at any time.  Lapsley Declaration ¶¶ 2-12.  If \n9  voters were to be told that they could register and vote through June 7, when there is no process \n10  by which that could happen, confusion and disarray would ensue.  Ordering the Secretary of State \n11  to issue a “public service announcement” with the content Plaintiffs demand would spread \n12  misinformation.  And Plaintiffs’ demand that the announcements be sent out “statewide” over \n13  radio and television would be costly.  Plaintiffs’ demand that all poll workers be ordered to offer \n14  a presidential ballot to an NPP voter, even when the voter has not requested it, omits any \n15  explanation as to how that could occur.  The poll workers are hired by local elections officials, \n16  not the Secretary of State.  Poll worker training likely has been completed in most, if not all, \n17  jurisdictions.  See, e.g., Jenab Declaration ¶ 2; Kennedy Declaration ¶ 7; Declaration of Jennifer \n18  J. Abreu (Doc. # 24) ¶ 3; Beck Declaration ¶ 3.; Declaration of Dawn DelMonte (Doc. # 19-3) \n19  ¶ 2.  And since only two counties have been sued in this litigation, there is no mechanism for \n20  ordering the other 56 counties to impose requirements on their poll workers.    \n21  Issuance of any injunction in this case would improperly and incorrectly communicate that \n22  the Secretary of State is not doing his job with respect to this election, and the elections officials \n23  are not doing theirs.  To allow this unprecedented disruption would undermine the hard work of \n24  thousands of poll workers, and California elections officials, who are working tirelessly to \n25  conduct a successful election.  Both the law and the public interest require that Plaintiffs not be \n26  allowed to use the Court to case a cloud over the legitimacy of the election.  The public interest \n27  requires that the election proceed without judicial interference. \n28 \n  17   \nOpposition of the Secretary of State to Motion for Preliminary Injunction (3:16-cv-02739-WHA )  \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 36   Filed 05/31/16   Page 26 of 26\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  The Court should deny the motion for preliminary injunction. \n3  Dated:  May 31, 2016  Respectfully Submitted,  \n   \n4  KAMALA D.

Crossover ballots allowed these no-party-\n25\npreference voters to vote in the presidential primaries of the Democratic Party, the American\n26\nIndependent Party, or the Libertarian Party, each of which had elected to accept crossover\n27\nballots.  (The Republican Party did not.)  Plaintiffs contend the information disseminated by\n28\ncertain election officials, including our defendants, inadequately informed no-party-preference\nvoters of the availability of crossover ballots and other related procedures.\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 74   Filed 08/26/16   Page 2 of 2\n1 At a hearing on June 1, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n2 A memorandum opinion followed the next day (Dkt. No. 46).  \n3 Defendants now move to dismiss the action because (i) the relief sought is now moot,\n4 (ii) plaintiffs lack standing, and (iii) plaintiffs fail to state a claim.  Plaintiffs do not respond to\n5 any of the arguments raised in the motions to dismiss, but instead seek to amend their\n6 complaint.  \n7 This action is plainly moot — the primary has already occurred.  To the extent plaintiffs\n8 seek to amend their complaint to address the 2020 presidential primaries, any claim based\n9 thereon is far from ripe.  We do not yet know if any political party will allow crossover ballots,\n10 nor do we know if our defendants will reinstate the practices complained of herein.\nt 11 Thus, because the action is moot and any proposed amendment would be futile,\nr\nu\nCo nia 12 defendants’ motions to dismiss are GRANTED.\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16 Dated:   August 26, 2016.                                                                \nted  For the  17 WUNILITLEIADM S TAALTSEUSP DISTRICT JUDGE\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n2",

Plaintiffs’ Voting Rights Act and \n5  constitutional arguments, and their request for leave to file a further amended complaint “to \n6  conform with the documents submitted prior to the injunction hearing,” recycle arguments and \n7  evidence that this Court has already determined to be legally inadequate.  The Court should \n8  dismiss the complaint without leave to amend. \n9  ARGUMENT \n10  I.  LEAVE TO FILE A FURTHER AMENDED COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DENIED ON \nGROUNDS OF FUTILITY. \n11 \n12  Although plaintiffs’ document is styled in part as an opposition, they do not directly address \n13  any of the threshold issues raised in the Secretary of State’s motion to dismiss, and ask to amend \n14  their Complaint.  Therefore, the only remaining issue is whether plaintiffs should be allowed \n15  leave to file a further amended pleading.1  The Court should deny leave to amend because \n16  amendment would be futile.  See Novak v. United States, 795 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir. 2015); \n17  Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Publ’g, 512 F.3d 522, 532 (9th Cir. 2008).  Plaintiffs have failed \n18  to show how an amendment would cure the deficiencies in their pleadings.  See TechnoMarine SA \n19  v. Giftports, Inc., 758 F.3d 493, 505 (2d Cir. 2014).  Instead, plaintiffs simply reiterate arguments \n20  the Court has already rejected.  \n21  A.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend Their Complaint to Avoid Mootness. \n22  Plaintiffs failed to address the Secretary of State’s argument that this action is moot because \n23  the June 7 primary is over.  The only allusion plaintiffs make to the mootness problem is their \n24 \n                                                           \n1 Both in their Opposition and in their papers filed in support of their motion for \n25  preliminary injunction plaintiffs refer to amending their complaint to conform to the evidence \npresented on their motion for preliminary injunction.  To the extent plaintiffs are suggesting that \n26  their complaint simply be deemed so amended, the court should reject that suggestion.  \nAmendments according to proof allows a plaintiff to assert a new issue based on evidence at trial, \n27  not at the pleading stage, and a complaint generally should only be deemed amended when an \nunpled issue has been tried with the express or implied consent of the parties.  Rule 15(b).    \n28 \n  1   \nThe Secretary of State’s Reply in Further Support of Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA ) \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 58   Filed 07/05/16   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  statement that the “legacy [of the primary] continues,” and that “[t]he battle for no-party-\n2  preference voters continues.”  Opposition at 1.  Like the allegations of the Complaint, all of the \n3  arguments in plaintiffs’ Opposition relate to the now-concluded primary.  Opposition at 2-11, 16-\n4  19.  The only remedy plaintiffs state that they will seek, if granted leave to amend their complaint, \n5  is “that poll workers must be uniformly trained to ask NPP voters whether they want to vote for a \n6  presidential candidate in any of the three crossover parties.”  Opposition at 8. \n7  The next presidential primary will be held in 2020, and at present there can be no certainty \n8  that any political party will allow crossover voting from no-party-preference voters in that \n9  election.  See CAL. ELEC. CODE § 13102(c).  There is no present controversy.  See \n10  Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. Brown, 752 F.3d 827, 834 (9th Cir. 2014).  In short, further \n11  amendment of plaintiffs’ complaint would be futile because, even as plaintiffs propose to amend \n12  them, plaintiffs’ claims are moot.   \n13  B.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend Their Complaint to Allege Standing. \n14  Plaintiffs’ opposition fails to address the Secretary of State’s standing argument or to \n15  explain how their proposed amended complaint can establish standing, that is, that plaintiffs can \n16  show: (1) an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \n17  actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there is a causal connection between the \n18  injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that \n19  the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n20  560-61 (1992) (citations and quotations marks omitted).  Any assumption that there will be \n21  problems with the 2020 presidential primary, such as inadequate poll worker training, is pure \n22  conjecture.  \n23  C.  Plaintiffs Do Not Identify Any Misconduct on the Part of the Secretary of \nState or Identify Any Relief It Would Seek Against Him in an Amended \n24  Pleading  \n25  Plaintiffs pejoratively accuse the Secretary of State of “gaming the system,” Opposition at 7, \n26  12, but the facts are to the contrary.  Plaintiffs concede that the Secretary’s instruction guide for \n27  the 2016 primary encouraged poll workers to ask no-party-preference voters if they wished to \n28  request a party presidential ballot, even though the Election Code does not require that.  \n  2   \nThe Secretary of State’s Reply in Further Support of Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA ) \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 58   Filed 07/05/16   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  Opposition at 7.  Plaintiffs also gripe generally about the Secretary’s alleged “lack of oversight” \n2  and failure to provide “guidance,” id. at 10, but also concede that local election officials have \n3  “enormous autonomy” to conduct their “affairs free of interference from the Secretary,” id. at 12, \n4  and plaintiffs fail to identify any action the Secretary should have but failed to take.  Plaintiffs \n5  have not shown that they could amend the Complaint to state a claim for relief against the \n6  Secretary.  \n7  D.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend Their Complaint to State a Claim for Violation of \nthe First or Fourteenth Amendments. \n8 \n9  Plaintiffs repeat their claims that party-affiliates must affirmatively be informed that they \n10  may re-register as no-party-preference voters, and that no-party-preference voters must be offered \n11  Democratic Party, American Independent Party, or Libertarian Party ballots by poll workers on \n12  Election Day, Opposition at 10, but fail to explain how the trivial burden of requiring voters to \n13  ask for a party ballot, as provided in the Elections Code, violates the federal Constitution under \n14  the balancing test in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992).  The Opposition identifies no \n15  new facts plaintiffs could allege that would salvage this claim. \n16  Griffin v. Burns, 431 F. Supp. 1361 (D.R.I. 1977), on which plaintiffs rely, is inapposite.  In \n17  that case, the votes of individuals who voted by absentee or shut-in ballots in a primary election \n18  were disallowed after a candidate challenged the election results based on a state law that did not \n19  allow absentee or shut-in ballots in primary elections.  The state mistakenly had been issuing and \n20  counting such ballots in primary elections for years; it had publicized that it would accept such \n21  ballots for the election in question; the disallowed ballots represented more than 10 percent of the \n22  total votes cast and determined the outcome of the election; plaintiffs presented evidence that at \n23  least some individuals would and could have voted in person had they known that their absentee \n24  or shut-in ballots would be disallowed; and the state’s actions “had an undeniable racial effect on \n25  the outcome of the election.”  Id. at 1363-64 & n.1.  No one denies the importance of the right to \n26  vote, but nothing in the Opposition suggests that qualified voters were denied the right to vote.  \n27  The fact that plaintiffs want voters to be given different information than that required by the \n28  Elections Code is not a violation of the electors’ equal protection or First Amendment rights. \n  3   \nThe Secretary of State’s Reply in Further Support of Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA ) \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 58   Filed 07/05/16   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  E.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend the Complaint to State a Claim for Violation of \nSection 10101(a)(2)(A) of the Voting Rights Act. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs argue that 52 U.S.C. section 10101(a)(2)(A) applies to more than voter \n4  registration, but cite no authority that supports that argument.  The statute expressly applies to the \n5  determination whether an individual is qualified to vote under state law.  Id.  The Opposition \n6  suggests no facts that plaintiffs could plead that would support a finding that the Secretary of \n7  State, or any defendant, is applying discriminatory standards in determining who is qualified to \n8  vote.    \n9  F.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend the Complaint to State a Claim for Violation of \nSection 10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights Act. \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs’ Opposition reveals that the sole factual basis for the claim under section \n12  10101(a)(2)(B) of the Voting Rights Act is their allegation that there has been a violation of \n13  Elections Code sections 3006 and 3007.7.  Opposition at 14.  Plaintiffs are wrong, but even if true \n14  their claims are irrelevant.  Plaintiffs have proffered no facts suggesting that anyone was denied \n15  the right to vote because his or her registration application contained an immaterial error or \n16  omission, which is what the statute requires.  See Washington Ass’n of Churches v. Reed, 492 F. \n17  Supp. 2d 1264, 1270 (W.D. Wash. 2006) (errors in voter registration application that preclude a \n18  voter’s name be matched to Social Security database or Department of Licensing database were \n19  not material to determining voter eligibility); Schwier v. Cox, 42 F. Supp. 2d 1266 (N.D. Ga. \n20  2005) (refusal to include social security number in voter registration application was not material \n21  in determining whether the applicant was qualified to vote under state law).  Indeed, rather than \n22  arguing an immaterial error or omission by the voter, plaintiffs are arguing (erroneously) that \n23  there was material error or omission by election officials.  (Opposition at 14.)2  That does not \n24  state a claim under section 10101(a)(2)(B). \n25 \n                                                           \n26  2 Plaintiffs’ observation that the “[c]ase law is somewhat unfavorable” to their position, \nOpposition at 14, is an understatement.  The court in Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1356, \n27  1371-72 (S.D. Fla. 2004), rejected an argument substantially similar to the one plaintiffs make \nhere.  \n28 \n  4   \nThe Secretary of State’s Reply in Further Support of Motion to Dismiss Complaint (3:16-cv-02739-WHA ) \n  \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 58   Filed 07/05/16   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  G.  Plaintiffs Cannot Amend the Complaint to State a Valid State Law Claim. \n2  Plaintiffs seek to dismiss their state law mandamus claim but ask for leave to amend.  \n3  (Opposition at 10.)  The Court should refuse their request.  Even if plaintiffs were to replead their \n4  Elections Code claims as non-mandamus claims, they would be fatally defective.  Plaintiffs’ \n5  Opposition acknowledges that the relief it seeks is an injunction.  (Opposition at 8, 10-11.)  \n6  Plaintiffs cannot get injunctive relief from this Court against state officials based on state law \n7  claims.  Katie A. ex. rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007); Clark v. \n8  Coye, 60 F.3d 600, 604 (9th Cir. 1995).  See Mem. Op. re Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 5.  Plaintiffs also \n9  have pointed to no facts or theories that were not before the Court on plaintiffs’ preliminary \n10  injunction motion, when the Court concluded that plaintiffs’ state law claims were substantively \n11  without merit.  Id. \n12  II.  THE COURT SHOULD NOT HEAR PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST TO FILE AN AMENDED \nCOMPLAINT ON JULY 12.  \n13 \n14  It is common for plaintiffs to request leave to amend a complaint in response to a motion to \n15  dismiss.  That request is considered in connection with that motion, and any argument is \n16  presented at the hearing on the motion.  Where a plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended \n17  complaint as an independent matter, that plaintiff is required to file a motion, not simply \n18  announce a hearing date, as plaintiffs have done.  The document Plaintiffs have filed does not \n19  have the essential attributes of a motion.  Local Rule 7-2(b.)  It also does not comply with notice \n20  requirements.  A motion must be filed at least 35 days in advance of the hearing, unless an order \n21  shortening time is obtained.  Local Rule 7-2(a).

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n   \nALEX PADILLA, et al.,    \n  Date:  6/1/16 \n    Defendants.   Time: 11:00 am \n  Dept:  8, Hon. William Alsup \n     \n        \n \n  The Plaintiffs have stated the essential relief sought in their Notice of Motion, which is \nsummarized here. \n1.   A public service announcement to all on the mailing lists used by the Defendants for \ntheir customary communications, including communications about this case, which \nenunciate the central points set forth in our Notice of Motion – essentially, to inform \nNPP voters of the key things they must do to assure their right to vote for President, \nand to notify poll workers and election officials that these NPP voters shall have the \nright to be informed that they may receive a Presidential primary ballot. \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       1 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 2 of 25\n2.  Plaintiffs ask that this be a statewide injunction, informing the Secretary of State and \nall county officials to use email, internet, radio and TV to get a consistent and concise \nmessage out so that the defects detailed in this brief and the declarations be resolved. \n3.  Plaintiffs also seek that the defendants be enjoined to order their poll workers to \ninform all NPP voters of their right to receive a presidential ballot and that this be \nenforced statewide against all election officials.  Plaintiffs do not have evidence that \nthis is being done in San Francisco, but have contradictory evidence in Alameda \nCounty and by the Secretary of State’s failure to enforce what is apparently its own \npolicy. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n \n  Plaintiffs apply to the court for preliminary injunctive relief.  This motion is based upon \nthe following facts: \n1.  The subject matter of the underlying application for a preliminary injunction \n(submitted to the Court with an ex parte application and motion to shorten time) \nconcerns the California Democratic Party primary election to occur on June 7, 2016;   \n   \n2.  Because of the nature of the remedies sought by the preliminary injunction applied for \nby the plaintiffs, to alleviate and mitigate the immediate and irreparable harm \npresently being caused by the dissemination of incorrect, misleading and incomplete \ninformation by the defendants to California voters who designated “no party \npreference” on their voter registrations and who wish to exercise their right to vote in \nthe 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary,1  Plaintiffs requested and received a \nhearing on their application for a preliminary injunction be held Wednesday, June 1, \n2016, or on the soonest possible date for this court prior to Tuesday, June 7.   \n                                                 \n1 The facts setting forth the immediate and irreparable harm to plaintiffs and affected \nCalifornia voters are set forth in the declarations filed in support of plaintiffs’ application for a \npreliminary injunction. \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 3 of 25\n3.  Notice of this ex parte application was provided to counsel for all defendants on May \n26, 2016 by William M. Simpich, counsel for plaintiffs. \n4.  The main relief sought by the Plaintiffs is as follows: \nA.  Because of erroneous information spread statewide due to the Secretary of State's \nomissions regarding its failure to monitor the boards of elections and their \nnumerous failures to adhere to the notice mandated by Elections Code 3006(b)(3), \n3006(c), and 3007.7 as stated in the Secretary of State’s uniform vote-by-mail \napplication: \n(1)  Public service announcements be sent out statewide to ensure uniformity in \nvoting procedures by email, internet postings, radio and TV, stating as follows:      \n(a)  All California voters have the right to receive a Presidential party ballot if \nthey are registered as of May 23, 2016, as stated in Elections Code 3006. \n(b) All California voters have the right to be informed that the deadline to \nrequest a vote by mail ballot is set by statute as May 31, as stated in \nElections Code Section 3006(c) \n(c) All California voters have the right to receive a regular Presidential ballot \nat the polling place, even if they did not file an application to vote by mail. \n(d) All California voters have the right to be offered a regular Presidential \nballot by the poll workers when they arrive at the polls, although they will \nhave to receive a provisional ballot if they fail to bring to the polls any vote \nby mail ballot that has been sent to them. \nB.   All poll workers shall inform the no party preference voters of their right to \nrequest a Presidential party ballot; \nC.  Sufficient ballots shall be provided at every polling station, which should be higher \nthan the statutory standard set forth in the California Elections Code Section 14102 \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 4 of 25\ndue to the high influx of no party preference voters registering since the previous \nelection. \n5.   The more ambitious relief sought by the Plaintiffs is that registration to vote be \nreopened until as late as Election Day if possible, in an attempt to remedy the failures \nin registration caused by the confusion resulting from the errors committed by both \nthese defendants and statewide, in order to protect the rights set forth in the Voting \nRights Act and in the Equal Protection Clause.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs’ intention in this case was to remedy the faulty application to vote by \nmail notices that came to counsel’s attention two weeks ago.  For ease this argument is \ntaken directly from counsel’s declaration: \n      Counsel knew that time was of the essence, as stated in his declaration to shorten \ntime and will not repeat that discussion here.  Mr. Joshua White was unwilling to \nadmit that the elections department had made any mistakes on their materials and tried \nto convince me that counsel was 100% wrong on every issue.  Counsel could see a \nlittle room for debate but counsel thought his approach to this situation was not fact-\nbased. \nAt Exhibit 11A-D of the Roguski Declaration, counsel has provided documents \nthat are a major basis of our contentions regarding San Francisco.  Exhibit 11A is a \nnotice informing the voters how “to request a ballot that includes the presidential \nprimary contest of one of these parties, mark the name of the party on the attached \npostage-paid postcard, and sign and return the postcard no later than April 18.  If you \ndo not request the ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not include a contest \nfor President.”   The impact to the reasonable voter is clear – if you don’t return the \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 5 of 25\npostcard by April 18, your ballot will not include a contest for President.  Ms. Mena, \nin her declaration, explains that she changed her registration from NPP to Democrat to \nheighten the chance she could vote for President after seeing this notice shortly after \nApril 18. \nCounsel went to the Elections office on Thursday, May 19 and obtained a copy of \nthe postcard that was attached to Exhibit 11-A by showing 11-A to the election worker \nand asking for a copy of the attached postcard.  That copy is attached as Exhibit 11B \nto the Roguski Declaration.  It contains a request for a vote-by-mail ballot but provides \nthe wrong date – pursuant to Elections Code 3006, any application for a vote by mail \nballot such as Exhibit 11B must be requested by May 31.  This application states that \nthe deadline is June 1.  The consequence of missing this deadline will mean that voters \nby mail will not receive by mail their ballot to vote for President, even though they are \nexpecting it.  It is a matter of common knowledge that a high percentage of California \nvoters vote by mail.  On information and belief, plaintiffs believe that the number \nvaries between ½ to 2/3 of the populace.  Similarly, it is common knowledge that a \nsubstantial number of voters in the state are no party preference; my understanding is \nthat number is somewhere between  23% to 25%.   This indicates that hundreds of \nthousands of NPP votes are at stake in this primary election; especially in light of a \nrecent May 25 US News & World Report article stating that at that time 50% of the \nNPP voters are Democrats, but only 14% of them at that time had received vote-by-\nmail ballots back in the mail.                  \n  These statistics are found in this widely circulated US News and World Report \narticle:  http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/bernies-ballot-burden-in-\ncalifornia.    Although this article contends that Bernie Sanders may be aided by \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 6 of 25\ngreater NPP or independent turnout, others may be able to argue that Hillary Clinton \nwill benefit from greater NPP or independent voter turnout.   The fact that some of the \nPlaintiffs support Sanders or the American Independent Party, or that plaintiffs’ \ncounsel likes Sanders, or that City Attorney Dennis Herrera has been identified \npublicly as a Clinton supporter should not matter in the slightest.  It is understandable \nthat passions might run high and people might have strong feelings, but what is at \nstake is the right to vote and applicable laws and procedures that protect that right. \nYet another problem with the City and County of San Francisco is that they sent \nout the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample Ballot in early May .  Counsel \ndiscussed his problem with this Mr. White in mid-May in a letter exchange.  It is his \nbelief that the Elections Code 3006(c) to all voter only needs to be given to NPP \nvoters.  It is counsel’s belief it needs to be given to all voters pursuant to the statute \nand the statutory scheme of which 3006 is a part.  Section 3000 states in essence that it \nis to be construed in a light most helpful to voters.         \n  Counsel believes that all voters need to have access to the 3006 notice in the \nstatute, because some of those voters may have switched to NPP status or may be \nconsidering such a switch, and they are entitled to this information in order to make an \ninformed decision.  Mr. White is of the completely opposite opinion, saying that \nproviding such a notice in an application to vote by mail would be more confusing to \nvoters.                     \n  It is clear that careful wordsmithing can address that issue while ensuring the rights \nof all.                     \n  For the record, counsel went online and noticed that the County of Santa Barbara \ntook the same approach on its sample ballot materials as CCSF did, and the concern is \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 7 of 25\nthat this error is being replicated throughout the state.   A document contrasting the \nparty and NPP sample ballot in San Francisco is attached as Exhibit 11C in the \nRoguski declaration.  Counsel provided these materials in Exhibit 11 to Mr Roguski \nfor inclusion in his declaration.    \nYet another problem with both defendant counties is that they are distributing the \napplications to vote by mail by electronic mail on their website.  See Exhibit 8-9, \nRoguski Declaration.  Defense counsel for both counties state that in both counties, if \nyou enter your data into the form, then the NPP data is provided to you and you get \nthat information.  However, it is a “distribution” to post these forms on a public \nwebsite where citizens perusing the website and trying to make intelligent decisions \nare not given the NPP information unless they log their data into the site and push \n“submit”.  This violates Election Code 3006© and 3007.7, which incorporates 3006(c) \nin its provisions in the electronic context of “distribution”.         \n  Counsel was unable to get San Francisco or Alameda to change this practice, but \ncounsel did convince San Mateo County to do so and Plaintiffs did not sue them as a \nresult of that positive gesture.  The Roguski Declaration, as a general matter, \nchronicles from Exhibits 1-14 defects in applications pursuant to 3006 as well as faulty \ninstructions throughout the state, and shows why Plaintiffs ask the court to strongly \nconsider statewide relief in this case. \nIt should be added that San Francisco failed to inform their voters pursuant to \n3006(b)(3) that voters applying to vote by mail have the right to deliver their \napplication directly to the elections county office by May 31.  They are not limited to \nhaving to do it by mail.  On a day such as today, May 28, it is not practical to submit \nthe application by mail.  Far better to go in during these last slow days of the election \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 8 of 25\nperiod by May 31 and review the materials in a calm setting before deciding how to \nreturn the ballots to a polling place. \nVoters are suffering from great confusion.  Besides the aforementioned Ms. \nMena’s confusion that led to her switch from NPP to Democratic, plaintiff and NPP \nregistrant Ms. Daims is concerned as well about whether she will be able to vote the \nDemocratic ballot.  Also concerned is Gary Remer, a voter in Monterey, whose \ndeclaration shows that he made a similar switch and witnessed great confusion in this \ncounty board of elections about who gets to vote in this election for President and \nhow.   Also concerned is Richard Troy, a voter in Alameda County:  His detailed \ndeclaration shows that despite his deep interest in the process of voting, his \nexperiences with the county board of elections in Alameda left him completely \nconfused.                    \n  Mimi Kennedy, a veteran poll worker in Los Angeles County, recounts how many \npeople have made mistakes in the past about thinking that the American Independent \nParty was the same as no party preference; how many voters are forced to vote \nprovisionally due to failure to bring their vote-by-mail ballots with them to the polls to \n“surrender” for a replacement ballot; and several other issues that illustrate why voters \nare suffering from great confusion with this primary.   \nAs counsel never heard from Alameda County counsel despite his post and his call \nto the defendant Tim Dupuis on May 13, 2016, Plaintiffs filed suit against both entities \nand the Secretary of State on May 20.  Plaintiffs learned that there was an issue in \ncounties about forcing NPP voters to vote provisionally if they wanted to vote for \nPresident, as in San Diego (see Declaration of Jennifer Abreu and Exhibits – even the \ntraining materials include this admonition to give NPP presidential voters provisional \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 9 of 25\nballots – on information and belief, these votes are not included in the count until two \nto four weeks after the election, and only 85% of the time according to leading voter \nanalyst Paul Mitchell), so Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include that issue. A \ncolleague served the Secretary of State on May 23, Mr. Simpich served Alameda \nCounty on May 25, and Mr. Simpich had the City served on May 28 even though Mr. \nWhite had the amended complaint and counsel have been in steady communication \nsince May 13 (unfortunately, counsel agree on very little). \nHowever, in the days ahead counsel was provided a number of very serious reports \nstating that in some counties the poll workers were being trained to not inform NPP \nvoters that they had the right to receive a Presidential primary ballot.  Counsel sifted \nthrough these numerous reports and obtained declarations from the aforementioned \nMs. Abreu of San Diego, Jeff Lewis of Santa Clara County, and Ashley Beck of \nOrange County.  All of them said that they were told not to inform the voter of this \nright, but to provide the Presidential primary ballot only when the voter asked for it.   \nConversely, witnesses such as Michelle Jenab of Los Angeles stated that they were \ntrained to ask the NPP voter if they would like a Presidential primary ballot.  (Note \nthat despite counsel’s best efforts counsel was able to include where she signed the \ndocument, but she informed counsel that she signed it in the County of Los Angeles on \nMay 26 – the date is reflected in the electronic signature.) Joshua White, the attorney \nfor the City and County of San Francisco on election matters as counsel understands it \nfrom his conversations with him, has told counsel that the City is informing NPP \nvoters that they can request a Presidential primary ballot, and that it is reflected in their \ntraining materials, and counsel presently has no evidence to dispute this assertion and \ndoes not make this request regarding the San Francisco defendants. \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 10 of 25\nHowever, the Secretary of State’s counsel Ms. Sharon O’Grady informed counsel \non May 27 that it is her understanding that the law is that the voter must request the \nballot and that there is no duty of the official to offer the ballot – that was counsel’s \nunderstanding of counsel’s conversation with her on that point.  She did not inform \ncounsel of the statute, if there is one.  Her own training materials illustrate that her \noffice states that NPP voters should be advised of the right to obtain a Presidential \nballot, a copy is attached as Exhibit 1 to this declaration, see page 3. \nThe County of Alameda has written counsel and states that their training materials \nshow that poll workers are trained to inform the NPP voter of their right to receive a \nPresidential ballot.  Plaintiffs’ two Alameda County poll worker witnesses are \nGabrielle Dolphin (who is a poll worker judge) and pollworker Dawn DelMonte.  Ms. \nDolphin came away from her training with the understanding that individual poll \nworkers were free to do as they liked – to inform or not to inform the NPP voter that \nthey had the right to request a Presidential party ballot.  Ms. DelMonte had the \nexperience of her trainer contradicting the training video which said that the poll \nworker shall inform the NPP voter of the right to request a Presidential party ballot.  \nShe says the trainer said do not provide that information, but wait for the voter to \nrequest a Presidential party ballot.             \n  In the last 24 hours, Ms. DelMonte was contacted by an individual working with \nelections who engaged in extensive inquiry about Ms. DelMonte’s recollection.  On \ninformation and belief, this included asking questions about the aforementioned pages \n43-44  – Ms. DelMonte believes that others may have been listening to this phone call.  \nOn information and belief, other witnesses were present with DelMonte who may be \nable to back up her story.                 \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 11 of 25\n  Counsel wishes to advise the court that Plaintiffs would like to reserve the right to \ncall one or two of these Alameda County witnesses in order to clarify what happened \nin this last 24 hours and previous period as well as it appears this sequence of events \nwill be a major  matter of contention. \nWe are asking for an order for poll workers to ask NPP voters whether they want \nto vote for a presidential candidate in any of the three crossover parties. A training \nmanual doesn't provide a remedy for an NPP voter who doesn't know their rights. The \nmanual is not dispositive of what is actually said to voters at the polling places, or how \nthe trainers were actually trained. The words in the manual do not prove what words \nare said to the voter in the polling place, or what words were said to the trainer in the \ntraining. \n        The content of the pages relating to crossover voting for nonpartisan voters in the \nAlameda County poll worker clerk manual  (pp 43-44, see exhibit 1 to Gabrielle \nDolphin’s declaration at docket numbers 14 and 20) is the same as the one for \njudges/inspectors (pp 67-70), except visually more material is crammed onto one page \nfor the clerks. In two instances, at the bottom of the respective slides, poll workers are \ntold to \"advise the Nonpartisan voters they are entitled to vote nonpartisan or in one of \nthe following parties: American Independent, Democratic, Libertarian.\"  The \"Roster-\nIndex Page: Crossover Voting for Nonpartisan Voters\" page of the inspector manual \nappears to be an empty green field below the title. (Page 70 in the judge/inspector \nmanual, and not in the clerk manual at all).  \n      In both of the Alameda County poll worker training manuals, there is no mention \nof Presidential candidates in the nonpartisan crossover voting, unlike in the Los \nAngeles poll worker training handbook, which specifically instructs poll workers to \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 12 of 25\nask NPP voters whether they wish to vote for the Presidential candidate for the \nAmerican Independent, Democratic or Libertarian party. This subtle difference points \nto an example of how low information voters can be confused. They might not \nunderstand that their No Party Preference / NP/ Nonpartisan ballot is missing a \nPresidential candidate, and most importantly, that the only way they get to vote for a \nPresidential candidate is by casting one of the crossover ballots. They might not \nrealize that the crossover ballots simply only add the Presidential candidate to their \nchoice of down ballot nonpartisan candidates and that they are not betraying their \nindependent status by choosing a crossover ballot.  \n        It is entirely possible that the County of Alameda is working very hard to make \nthe voting experience a positive one – and the same for San Francisco, and their \npositive efforts should be commended, however, it is in these subtle wording and \nvisual choices involving both the training materials and the applications to vote for \nmail and attendant instructions that have important information has been omitted (or \nambiguously phrased) to the serious detriment of nonpartisan voters. We have \nidentified these subtle differences, and are concerned that many nonpartisan voters are \nnot informed in a sufficiently clear manner what their rights and duties are. We realize \nit is a daunting task, but we also wish to help those voters get all the information they \nneed, in as clear and accurate way as possible, to successfully vote according to their \nwishes. \nTHEORIES BEHIND PLAINTIFFS’ CAUSES OF ACTION \nThis action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to secure equitable relief from \nDefendants’ unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights, privileges and immunities \nguaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 13 of 25\nStates Constitution; Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. 10101(a)(2)(A) \nand (B); and other laws of the United States and the state of California. This action is also \nbrought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1361 to seek a writ of mandamus. Jurisdiction is \nconferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343. Declaratory relief can be sought \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and § 2202.  \n“No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the \nelection of those who make the laws…” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). \nPlaintiffs bring the instant lawsuit to protect the right to vote by mail, early voting, \nregistration, and informational voting rights of millions of California voters. Nearly 70% \nof ballots cast in the 2014 California special election were by mail, and over 65% of the \nballots cast in the 2012 presidential preference primary were by mail. \nhttp://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-absentee/  \nThe impact of failure to inform NPP voters (no party preference voters) of their \nright to obtain a “crossover ballot” and to vote in the Presidential primary is significant, as \nis the failure to inform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no party \npreference voters and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, \nAmerican Independent, and Libertarian parties. All Californians’ voting rights have been \nand will continue to be denied or unreasonably infringed upon due to the lack of oversight \nof the California Secretary of State and county Boards of Elections.      \n   This action seeks injunctive relief to redress the widespread and ongoing failure to \nprovide information regarding the protected voting rights of “no party preference” voters \nto receive a Democratic, American Independent or Libertarian presidential ballot. \nInadequate information has also been provided regarding the right of “no party preference \nvoters” to personally deliver their application to vote by mail to the county board of \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 14 of 25\nelections office by May 31, 2016 in order to mail their ballot in by the last day of the \nprimary on June 7.  \nThis failure to provide adequate information is in violation of the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965, 52 U.S.C.A. § 10101 et seq, California Elections Code Section 3000 et seq., \nand the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of Equal Protection, applied to states pursuant to the \nFourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs are eligible California voters (one Democratic and one \nno party preference); Voting Rights Defense Project (an organization campaigning to \nheighten voter education and voter turnout for their candidate Bernie Sanders); and the \nAmerican Independent Party itself. These Plaintiffs and their associational members have \nbeen deprived of voting rights, as have the many similarly situated voters who have \ncomplained to their local Boards of Elections regarding applications to vote by mail, early \nvoting, registration, and informational voting rights. Thousands of Californians are in \nimminent danger of being disenfranchised in the 2016 presidential primary election ending \non June 7, 2016, and will continue to be shut out of the democratic process unless and \nuntil Defendants reform their voting by mail practices.  \nCongresss enacted section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to prevent certain \ntypes of situations. One situation is where some voters in a county are being treated in a \ndifferent manner from other voters in the county. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A). The other \nsituation is where individuals are denied the right to vote “because of an error or omission \non any record or paper” which is “not material in determining whether such individual is \nqualified under State law to vote.” 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B)  \nDefendant Tim Dupuis, the chief of the Alameda County Registrar of Voters, has \nengaged in a pattern and practice that will disenfranchise thousands of Alameda County \nvoters. During the last two weeks, this Defendant distributed a series of notices to \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 15 of 25\nAlameda County voters that did not provide information that is required to be given to \nCalifornia voters pursuant to Elections Code Section 3000 et seq. Because of this failure to \nprovide proper notice, these voters will be unable to vote for the candidate of their choice \nunless there is prompt and effective intervention by this court.  \nSpecifically, both the Defendants Tim Dupuis and John Arntz (chief of the San \nFrancisco Department of Elections) distributed to the voters an electronic application to \nvote for mail on Dupuis’ Oakland website and Artnz’s San Francisco website that violated \nElections Code § 3006(c) and 3007.7(e). Both of these applications failed to provide the \nmandatory notice to all voters of their right to state no party preference; and, further, that a \nno party preference voter shall be provided with a Democratic, American Independent \nParty or a Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot.  \nFurthermore, Defendant Arntz (and on information and belief, Defendant Dupuis) violated \nElections Code Section 3006 by preparing the Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample Ballot in a \nnon-uniform manner. This time, the aforementioned mandatory notice was properly provided at \nthe back page of the pamphlet to all the no party preference voters. However, the mandatory \nnotice was not provided to the voters that were members of political parties. It was mandatory to \nprovide this information by law to all voters, not just the no party preference voters.  \nThe failure to provide this information meant that Bay Area citizens who were members of \npolitical parties were not provided with choices that reasonably could have led them to select no party \npreference and request a Presidential primary ballot. This same error was committed in Santa Barbara \nCounty and other counties throughout the state of California. This statewide error occurred even after \nthe Secretary of State created a uniform vote by mail application that conformed with Elections Code \n3007.5 and included the proper language that was missing as described above. For reasons of their \nown, the Defendants and many of their colleagues throughout the state elected not to use the Secretary \nof State’s uniform vote by mail application, but instead omitted essential terms in their applications. \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       15 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 16 of 25\n  Another essential term that was missing in certain applications created by the Defendants was \nthe mandatory notice contained in Elections Code 3006(b)(3) that applicants to vote by mail have the \n“legal right” to personally “deliver” the application to the County Elections Office by May 31 rather \nthan rely on mail or fax. These particular application forms would mention the May 31 date, but did \nnot mention the “personal delivery” option or that the applicant had the “legal right” to deliver the \napplication in this fashion.  \nIt is reasonable to assume that this omission will result in more late applications and less early \nvoting, as applicants who deliver the application could receive the proper Presidential primary ballot \nand vote right there on the spot. In turn, it is reasonable to assume that late applications will result in \nmany more citizens failing to obtain a Presidential primary ballot.  \n/// \nPARTIES TO THE ACTION  \nBoth Defendants Tim Dupuis and John Arntz, as part of their official duties, are responsible \nfor conducting Federal, State, County, special and local elections. Thus, they are sued in their official \ncapacities. Pursuant to the leadership of these Defendants, the Alameda County Registrar of Voters \nand the San Francisco Department of Elections prepare the published notices of elections and lists of \noffices for which candidates are to be nominated. It is the duty of these agencies to prepare and print \nofficial and sample ballots; mail sample ballots to registered voters; recruit elecion officers and \npolling places; and provide the roster and street index and other supplies for use by the election \nofficers at the polls. These agencies are also required to establish and revise voting precincts, provide \nfor the tabulation of returns on election night, and conduct the official canvass of votes cast.  \nFurthermore, these agencies had the duty to prepare applications to vote by mail that complied \nwith the mandatory notices contained in the uniform vote by mail application prepared by the \nSecretary of State. As described above, the defendants and similar agencies throughout the state failed \nin providing these mandatory notices. Based on information and belief, the defendants have been \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       16 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 17 of 25\ninvolved in training poll workers to provide no preference party voters with provisional ballots; the \nplaintiffs seek an order that a provisional ballot will be given to a voter only when there is no other \nalternative. News reports state that a high percentage of provisional ballots never make it into the \nofficial count.  \nThe Secretary of State Alex Padilla is named as an indispensable party. The Secretary of State created \nthe regulations that the Elections Code rely on. On information and belief, the Secretary of State failed \nto properly advise the other Defendants, despite the enormous autonomy that the Defendants enjoy in \nrunning their own affairs free of interference from the Secretary.  In Wash. Ass'n of Churches v. \nReed, 492 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96444 (W.D. Wash. 2006) the court \naddressed defendant's argument that he is not the proper defendant to this action. Defendant \ninitially asserted that, while he maintains the voter statewide registration list, the counties actually \nregister voters, and therefore he has no direct control over the 39 separately-elected county \nauditors. Defendant further asserted that these county auditors are not his \"agents,\" such that he \ncould somehow order the counties to register mismatched applicants. \nPlaintiffs responded that defendant had undersold his authority, and that he indeed is the proper \ndefendant. As in Washington state, the Secretary of State is the chief elections officer of the state, \nand he has supervisory control over local elections officials, including the power and \nresponsibility to issue instructions and promulgate rules to ensure that elections are conducted in a \nuniform manner.  The powers are not as strong as in Washington state, but the facts in this case \nfrom the poll workers and the applications to vote by mail show that the Secretary of State is not \nconducting sufficient guidance in a uniform manner. \nPlaintiff Voting Rights Defense Project is an unincorporated association based in Oakland, \nCalifornia. The organizational plaintiff was created to campaign for the success of Bernie Sanders in \nhis quest for votes in the California Presidential primary. It has no formal relationship with the \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       17 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 18 of 25\nSanders campaign. This Plaintiff is engaged in taking action of various kinds with like-minded voters \nto ensure that the turnout for their preferred candidate is as large as possible. As voting in this primary \nbegan on May 9 and will continue until June 7, the primary election has officially begun and the \ncampaigning activity is ongoing.  \nPlaintiff American Independent Party of California is a political party that has obtained ballot \nspace in California. Elections Code Section 7500. The rules governing its ballot access are contained \nwithin Elections Code 6500 et seq.; in these sections, this Plaintiff is referred to as simply the \nAmerican Independent Party.  \nPlaintiff Suzanne Bushnell is a registered Democratic voter in the City and County of San \nFrancisco. As a Democratic voter in San Francisco and the state of California, she has been injured \ndue to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the mandatory notice provisions set forth above. \nShe has “informational standing” due to these omissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled to \nrelief designed to restore her to the situation she would have been in if this information was not denied \nto her. She is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a Presidential party ballot for Bernie \nSanders if she becomes a no party preference voter. Her rights as a voter have been chilled as a result. \nPlaintiff Clara Daims is a registered no party preference voter in the City and County of San \nFrancisco. As a no party preference voter in San Francisco and the state of California, she has been \ninjured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the mandatory notice provisions set forth \nabove. She has “informational standing” due to these omissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled \nto relief designed to restore her to the situation she would have been in if this information was not \ndenied to her. She is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a Presidential party ballot for Bernie \nSanders if she remains a no party preference voter. Her rights as a voter have been chilled as a result.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(A) and 42 USC 1983).  \nDefendants’ actions violate 52 USC 10101(a)(2), generally known as “Section 2” of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part: \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       18 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 19 of 25\n(2) No person acting under color of law shall – (A) in determining whether any individual is qualified \nunder State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, practice, or procedure difference \nfrom the standards, practices or procedures applied under such law or laws to other individuals within \nthe same county, parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found by State officials to be \nqualified to vote. . .                    \n  Private litigants may enforce their rights under 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a) by bringing a suit under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants, acting under color of state law, applied different standards, practices, \nor procedures in determining whether party voters would be given voter informational rights than \nwere applied to no party preference voters.   Jeffers v. Clinton, 730 F. Supp. 196, 204 (E.D. Ark. \n1989) (three-judge court) (Arnold, J.) (finding that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \"should be \nconstrued liberally in favor of its object, which is to open up the electoral process to full \nparticipation\").   The facts here illustrate a long series of intra-county and inter-county practices \nwhere some counties provide the necessary NPP information to NPP voters and some do not; \nsome provide the requisite vote by mail information to all voters and some do not; and some poll \nworkers provide the information needed to NPP voters and some do not.  This is an elementary \nviolation of the statute.  Compare the declarations of the poll workers in San Diego, Orange, and \nSanta Clara (no notice given) with the policies of San Francisco and Los Angeles (notice given) \nwith the custom of Alameda (Plaintiffs’ evidence indicates that poll workers decide for \nthemselves whether or not notice will be given). \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) and 42 USC 1983)  \n52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part: \"No person \nacting under color of state law shall … deny the right of any individual to vote in any election because \nof an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or other act \nrequisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in determining whether such individual \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       19 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 20 of 25\nis qualified under State law to vote in such election.\" See Schwier v. Cox, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1266 \n(N.D. Ga. 2005) (finding a Georgia requirement that voting registrants disclose Social Security \nnumber before voting violated materiality provision of Voting Rights Act), aff'd, 439 F.3d 1285 \n(11th Cir. 2006).                    \n  Certain Plaintiffs – or the individuals that they represent - are in imminent danger of being \ndenied the right to vote in the Presidential primary election because of the errors and omissions \ncontained in the mandatory notices containing crucial information necessary in order to obtain the \nballot. These errors or omissions are not material in determining whether these individuals are \nqualified under State law to vote in the June 2016 Presidential primary election.  \nFriedman v. Snipes, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23739, 18 Fla. L. \nWeekly Fed. D 63 (S.D. Fla. 2004)  offers the best guidance in this situation.  After analysis, the \ncourt ruled against the  Plaintiffs because the errors or omissions did not happen in a record or \npaper.  In this instance, the 3006 and 3007.7 violations occurred in precisely this manner.  The \nfact  that Defendants got it right sometimes does not excuse the statutory violation.   It is a serious \nerror and omission that fundamentally impacts the voter’s rights to information.   Voters have \ninformational rights that must be assiduously respected. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (First and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42 USC 1983)  \nDefendants’ actions violated the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the \nequal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, as the acts of \nthe defendants towards the no party preference voters constituted arbitrary discrimination of these \nplaintiffs as well as the associational classes that Voting Rights Defense Project and American \nIndependent Party represent.                   \n  The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution require that courts closely \nscrutinize challenged election regulations, weighing “the character and magnitude of the asserted \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       20 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 21 of 25\ninjury . . . against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \nimposed by its rule.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).        \n  The facts here illustrate arbitrary discrimination.  Some CA counties send complete \ninformation to NPP voters while others fail to do so.  Similarly, there is a failure to treat similarly \nsituated parties equally under the Elections Code.  California has a very high incidence of by-mail \nvoters compared to other states.   Nearly 70% of ballots cast in the 2014 California special \nelection were by-mail, and over 65% of the ballots cast in the 2012 presidential preference \nprimary were by-mail.  http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-absentee/  Therefore, the \nimpact of failure to inform NPP voters of their right to vote a Presidential party ballot is \nsignificant.  \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTOR TEST IN FEDERAL CASES  \nSee Project Vote v. Blackwell, 455 F.Supp.2d 694, 699 (N.D. Ohio 2006).  In exercising \nits discretion to enter a preliminary injunction order, this Court must consider four factors: \n\"(1) they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) \na preliminary injunction is in the public interest.\" Sierra Forest Legacy v. Rey, 577 F.3d \n1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 19). \nFurther, the Ninth Circuit's \"'serious questions' approach survives Winter when applied as \npart of the four-element Winter test.\" Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d \n1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). In other words, \"'serious questions going to the merits' and a \nbalance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a \npreliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of \nirreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.\" Id. \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       21 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 22 of 25\nAny series of events that results in suppression of the vote – intentional or unintentional - \n\"seeks to decrease the number of eligible voters and, generally, take the electoral power \naway from individuals or groups.\"  It is an umbrella term that includes a number of \npractices that have the intent or effect of preventing people or a group of people from \nvoting.  \nGilda R. Daniels, Voter Deception, 43 Ind. L. Rev. 343, 359 (2010). \n \nEven after the enactment of the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA) eligible citizens have \nhad to navigate \"a complicated maze of local laws and procedures\" creating obstacles to \nvoting sometimes \"as restrictive as the outlawed practices.\"  H.R. REP. NO. 103-9, at 3. \n\"Voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.'\" \nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433, 112 S. Ct. 2059, 119 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1992) \n(quoting Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184, 99 \nS. Ct. 983, 59 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1979)). \n“It is important to recognize that the four considerations applicable to preliminary \ninjunctions are factors to be balanced and not prerequisites that must be satisfied. These \nfactors simply guide the discretion of the court; they are not meant to be rigid and \nunbending requirements.” In re Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., 963 F.2d 855, 859 (6th Cir. \n1992). Thus, “the degree of likelihood of success required may depend on the strength of \nthe other factors.” In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985). “In \ngeneral, the likelihood of success that need be shown (for a preliminary injunction) will \nvary inversely with the degree of injury the plaintiff will suffer absent an \ninjunction.” Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 105 (6thCir. \n1982) (internal citation omitted).               \n  Griffin v. Burns, (D.R.I. 1977) 431 F.Supp. 1361, 1366 (D.R.I. 1977) is an \nillustrative case, even when Plaintiffs must hurdle the more difficult argument of equal \nprotection as contrasted to the Voting Rights Act.  The facts concern failure to properly \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       22 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 23 of 25\nnotify and issue absentee ballots in a Rhode Island primary election.   “The Court rejects \nany contention that no relief is justified. Plaintiffs have been deprived of a valuable, and \nfundamental, right. The Court ought to remedy this loss if it can do so equitably. The \ndefendants did not present, and the Court cannot find, any compelling equitable reasons to \ndeny relief” at 1368. \n“[T]here is an undoubted right, guaranteed by the constitution, to vote in primary elections \non an evenhanded basis together with other qualified voters.” Citing Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. \n649, 660-662, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944); United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 318, 61 \nS.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941)) \nThe right to vote on an equal basis with other citizens is a fundamental right in a free \nsociety; indeed, in any viable form of representative government. It is preservative of all \ngovernmental rights. Yick Wo. v. Hopkins, 1886, 118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220, \n226. “The right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic \nsociety, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.” Citing \nHarman v. Forssenius, 1965, 380 U.S. 528, 537, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 1183, 14 L.Ed.2d 50, 57 (poll \ntax). \n            California's vote-by-mail ballot application process for the 2016 presidential primary \nbegan on May 9, 2012. CAL. ELEC. CODE §§ 3000, et seq.  See \nhttp://sfgov.org/elections/important-election-dates-and-deadlines, showing that the voter by mail \napplication was sent to all voters by May 9.  The San Francisco and Alameda County forms \nchallenged here do not comply with any of the mandates of Elections Code Section 3006(c).   The \npractices of the Alameda County Board of Elections do not comply with the mandates set out in \nthe guidance materials of either the Secretary of State or of Alameda County.  What is even \nworse, if possible, is that the problems in the outlying counties are even more severe than in San \nFrancisco or Alameda County. \n              In weighing these factors, the public interest in maximizing the vote is high.  The cost of \nproviding information to the voters is low.    The instructions need to be pithy and short.  A \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       23 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 24 of 25\nsubstantial portion of the population struggles with functional illiteracy and cannot be expected to \ndrink from a firehose of information.                \n            CONCLUSION                                     \n  There is no reason for the voter to have to drink from a firehose by absorbing 100 pages of \ninformation from the Voters Information Pamphlet circulated in May 2016 to learn how to vote – \nmuch less to adopt an argument made by the defense that the 100 pages of information should be \nconsidered as part of an application to vote by mail in the relevant instances.     \n  What are other good remedies besides policy guidance to poll workers and a strong PSA \noutreach with pithy information and the muscle of a court order?  Extending registration would be \none good remedy, given the seriousness of the 3006 violations set forth here regarding the \napplications to vote by mail and the right to personally deliver one’s vote-by-mail request to the \nelections board pursuant to 3006(b)(3).     Another problem was the faulty instructions that often \noccur in the March to May period while information on the voters is being collected for mailing \nout the Voters Information Pamphlet.  That is certainly the cause of San Francisco’s faulty \ninstructions seen in Exhibit 11.                 \n  The court has the power to fashion effective remedies in this context, especially as new \ncitizens are permitted to register between May 23 and Election Day. A remedy should be offered \nto those who lost the right to vote or had it imperiled due to the errors chronicled in this brief.  \nThis is just one ambitious remedy, but any remedy and any order of this court should make it \nclear that the voting process demands uniformity and fairness – no one wants to create a situation \nwhere unscrupulous people can game the system and endanger the integrity of the voting system. \n  /// \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES       24 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 29   Filed 05/28/16   Page 25 of 25\n \n___________/s/_____________ \nWILLIAM M.

This is hogwash.  The Department has engaged in a massive public \n7  outreach effort over the last four months to educate voters about these precise issues and provide them \n8  with the means to select the presidential primary in which they’d like to vote.  Among many other \n9  efforts, the Department has sent a mailer to all NPP voters who have applied to vote by mail informing \n10  them that they can vote in one of the presidential primaries by submitting an attached, postage paid \n11  form.  Similarly, all NPP voters who go to the Department’s website to look up their registration status \n12  or apply to vote by mail will see that, to vote in a presidential primary, they must fill out a form that \n13  they can access by clicking on a link.  The Department has also sent a Voter Information Pamphlet \n14  (“VIP”) to every registered San Francisco voter explaining how NPP voters can vote in a presidential \n15  primary, and on the back of every VIP sent to an NPP voter is a form that the voter can submit to the \n16  Department indicating the primary in which he or she would like to vote.  In addition, the Department \n17  trains poll workers to inform NPP voters at the polling place on Election Day that they may vote in a \n18  presidential primary, and every polling place has a sign that contains this information.  The \n19  Department’s efforts to inform voters who have selected a party preference how to change that \n20  preference have been just as extensive. \n21  Ignoring the Department’s outreach campaign entirely, Plaintiffs assert a variety of baseless \n22  legal claims.  First, Plaintiffs assert that the Department has violated two provisions of the Voting \n23  Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A) and 10101(a)(2)(B).  But the first provision on which Plantiffs \n24  rely applies only to voter registration practices, and is inapplicable to this case.  And the second \n25  provision restricts registrars from omitting material information from voter materials, when the \n26  Department did just the opposite here.   Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Department has violated the \n27  First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by supposedly failing to \n28  provide sufficient information to NPP voters about their right to vote in a presidential primary.  This \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.  1 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01110025.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 33   Filed 05/31/16   Page 7 of 30\n \n1  claim fails because, far from burdening the voting rights of San Franciscans, the Department has gone \n2  to great lengths to help San Franciscans fulfill those rights.  Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Department \n3  has violated a provision of the California Elections Code that requires the Department to inform NPP \n4  voters that they may vote in a presidential primary.  As a legal matter, Plaintiffs’ claim fails because \n5  the statute under which they are seeking relief—28 U.S.C. § 1361—applies exclusively to violations \n6  of law by federal officials, not state or local officials.  And as a factual matter, Plaintiffs’ claims fail \n7  because the Department went above and beyond its statutory duty to educate all voters about voting in \n8  the presidential primary and their right to change their party preference.   \n9  In addition to not establishing a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs have also fallen \n10  short on every other element of the test for a preliminary injunction.  See Winter v. Natural Resources \n11  Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008).  There has been no irreparable injury—indeed, there has \n12  been no injury whatsoever—as the Department has provided Plaintiffs, like all San Francisco voters, \n13  with all required information regarding which presidential primaries they can vote in and how to \n14  change their party preference.  Any alleged injury to Plaintiffs or any San Francisco voters is so \n15  speculative that even Plaintiffs are unable to articulate a concrete harm.  In addition, the balance of \n16  hardships and the public interest weigh strongly against a preliminary injunction here.  The remedies \n17  Plaintiffs seek are impossible, unnecessary, and/or unwarranted, and would sow confusion on the eve \n18  of Election Day.  For these reasons, the Court should deny the motion for preliminary injunction. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n19 \nI.  SAN FRANCISCO’S DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS. \n20 \nThe Department conducts all federal, state and local elections in San Francisco.  Declaration of \n21 \nJohn Arntz (“Arntz Dec.) ¶ 2.  Serving nearly 467,000 registered voters, the Department must ensure \n22 \nthat the City meets all applicable legal deadlines, that it has adequate staff and equipment to provide \n23 \nelection services, that the recording and tabulation of votes is accurate and secure, and that voting \n24 \nequipment and polling places are usable and accessible to voters.  See id.  For the presidential primary \n25 \nelection on June 7, 2016, the Department has hired approximately 250 temporary employees, \n26 \nincluding more than 30 dedicated to voter services and outreach.  See id.  On Election Day, the \n27 \nDepartment will manage 576 polling places staffed by 2,500 volunteer poll workers.  See id. \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.  2 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01110025.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 33   Filed 05/31/16   Page 8 of 30\n \n1  Federal, state and local law closely regulate and prescribe nearly every aspect of the \n2  Department’s operations to ensure that San Francisco’s elections are fair and functional.  See id. ¶ 3.  \n3  In compliance with these laws, the Department must adhere to a strict schedule to complete essential \n4  tasks for each election, including: ordering ballot supplies; preparing and printing ballots; mailing \n5  overseas and other vote-by-mail (formerly known as absentee) ballots; printing and distributing \n6  information to the voters; training employees and poll workers; testing the accuracy of every voting \n7  machine that will be used in the election; counting and tabulating votes; and conducting a mandatory \n8  post-election hand count to verify election results.  See id. ¶ 3.   \nII.  THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION ON JUNE 7, 2016. \n9 \n10  When registering to vote in California, a person has the option of selecting a political party \n11  preference.  See id. ¶ 4.  Voters who register to vote without stating a party preference are known as \n12  “No Party Preference” or NPP voters.  See id.  Each political party has the option of allowing NPP \n13  voters to vote in its presidential primary.  See id.  For California’s presidential primary election on \n14  June 7, 2016, three political parties have chosen to allow NPP voters to vote on their presidential \n15  primary ballot:  the Democratic Party, the American Independent Party, and the Libertarian Party.  See \n16  id. ¶ 3.  \n17  State law establishes the procedures for voting by mail.  See Cal. Elections Code § 3000, et \n18  seq.  To obtain a vote-by-mail ballot, a person must apply by filling out an application and transmitting \n19  it to the Department by the seventh day prior to the election.  Cal. Elections Code § 3001.  For the \n20  June 7 election, that deadline is May 31.  See id. ¶ 5.  \nIII.  THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO INFORM NPP \n21 \nVOTERS THAT THEY MAY VOTE IN A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. \n22 \nThe Department has made extensive efforts to inform NPP voters—both those who have \n23 \napplied to vote by mail and those who will be voting in-person at a polling place—that they may vote \n24 \nin one of the three presidential primaries.  See id. ¶ 6.      \n25 \nFirst, the Department has sent mailers to all NPP voters who have already applied to vote by \n26 \nmail informing them that they may request a “crossover ballot,” i.e., a ballot that allows them to vote \n27 \nin a presidential primary in the June election.  See id. ¶ 7, Ex. A.  The mailers state:   \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

Each political party can allow voters with no party \npreference to vote in its presidential primary election.  For the June 7 \n2  Presidential Primary Election, the following political parties will allow voters \nwith no party preference to vote in their primary election for President of the \n3  United States:  \nAmerican Independent Party          Democratic Party           Libertarian Party \n4 \nTo request a ballot that includes the presidential primary contest of one of these \n5  parties, mark the name of the party on the attached postage paid postcard, and \nsign and return the postcard no later than April 18. If you do not request the \n6  ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not include a contest for President. \nVote-by-mail ballots will be mailed in early May (April for military and \n7 \noverseas voters). For more information about the June 7 election, visit \nsfelections.org or call the Department of Elections at (415) 554-4375. \n8 \nAlternatively, you may call the Secretary of State at (800) 345-8683 or visit \nsos.ca.gov. \n9 \n10  See id., Ex. A.  In addition, each mailer includes an application that allows NPP voters to request a \n11  vote-by-mail ballot for one of the three political parties.  Id.   \n12    Second, the Department includes a detailed “Voting Instructions” guide with every vote-by-\n13  mail ballot sent to San Francisco voters.  See id. ¶ 8, Ex. B.  That guide states, in relevant part: \nIf you chose no party preference when you registered to vote, your ballot will \n14 \nnot include a presidential primary contest. You may request a ballot that \nincludes the presidential primary contest of one of the three parties that chose to \n15 \nallow voters with no party preference to participate: American Independent, \nDemocratic, or Libertarian. Call (415) 554-4375 or visit sfelections.org/ \n16 \nvbmstatus. If you have already requested a ballot with the presidential primary \ncontest, the enclosed ballot reflects your request.    \n17 \n18  See id. ¶ 8, Ex. B.  An NPP voter may then request a replacement ballot that includes a presidential \n19  primary ballot.  See id. ¶ 8.  The guide includes a link to the Department’s website where the voter can \n20  request a replacement ballot.  See id. ¶ 8, Ex. B.  A copy of the replacement ballot form is attached as \n21  Exhibit C to Director Arntz’s declaration.   \n22  Third, in early May 2016, the Department provided a Voter Information Pamphlet (“VIP”) to \n23  every registered San Francisco voter.1  See id. ¶ 9.  Though the substance of the VIP is the same for all \n24  voters, the back cover varies depending on whether or not the voter has expressed a party preference.  \n25  See id. ¶ 9.  All back covers contain a vote-by-mail application.  See id. ¶ 9.  However, for NPP \n26  voters, the application includes the option to select a party preference: \n27                                                   \n1 In addition, the Department mails VIPS to people who register to vote after the VIPs have \n28  been mailed.  Arntz Dec., ¶ 9.  The VIP is also available online in multiple languages.  See id.  \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

For this election, the following \npolitical parties will allow voters with no party preference to vote in their \n2  primary election for President of the United States: American Independent, \nDemocratic, Libertarian. \n3 \nNote: If you do not request the ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not \ninclude a contest for President. \n4 \nI have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party.  However, \n5  for this primary election only, I request a vote-by-mail ballot of the ______ \nparty (choose one): \n6 \n___American Independent     ___Democratic        ___Libertarian \n7  For more information, call 1-800-345-VOTE, or visit sos.ca.gov.  \n8 \nSee id. ¶ 9, Ex. D.2  A voter who submits this application will receive a crossover ballot for the \n9 \npresidential primary indicated on the application.  See id. ¶ 9.   \n10 \nFourth, the Department’s website offers voters an online tool to look up their voter registration \n11 \nstatus.  See id. ¶ 10, Ex. F, G.  An NPP voter who looks up his status will be informed that he is an \n12 \nNPP voter.  See id. ¶ 10, Ex. F, G.  If the voter has not applied to vote by mail (i.e., will be voting in \n13 \nperson at a polling place), the website states:  \n14  Our records indicate that you declined to disclose a preference for a qualified \npolitical party when you registered to vote.  For this primary election only, you \n15  may request a ballot that includes the presidential primary contest of one of \nthese parties: American Independent, Democratic, Libertarian.   \n16 \nWhen you vote on Election Day, please ask a poll worker for the ballot you \nprefer. \n17 \n18  See id. ¶ 10, Ex. F.  If the NPP voter has applied to vote by mail, the voter is provided the same \n19  statement, but is also informed that to vote in one of the presidential primaries, he must request a \n20  crossover ballot for one of the three political parties that have opened their presidential primaries to \n21  NPP voters.  See id. ¶ 10, Ex. G. \n22  Fifth, an NPP voter who signs up on the Department’s website to vote by mail will be provided \n23  with similar information.  The first step in the online application process is to enter the voter’s house \n24  number, zip code, and date of birth.  See id. ¶ 11, Ex. H.  From this information, the Department can \n25  determine if the person is an NPP voter.  See id. ¶ 11.  If so, the voter is informed that he has the \n26 \n27                                                   \n2 Exhibit E to Director Arntz’s declaration is the back page of a VIP that a non-NPP voter \n28  would receive.   \nOpp. of S.F.

I.  The page contains a link to that application.  See id.3   \n3  Sixth, the Department has trained all poll workers to inform NPP voters that they have the \n4  option of voting for one of the three designated parties.  See id. ¶ 12, Ex. K.  In addition, every polling \n5  place in San Francisco has a sign informing NPP voters that they may vote in one of these primaries.  \n6  See id. ¶ 12, Ex. L.   \n7  Seventh, the VIP, which, as noted above, is sent to every registered San Francisco voter and is \n8  available on the Department’s website, provides answers to questions such as “What does party \n9  preference mean?”; “How can I find out my party preference?”; “How can I change my party \n10  preference?” and “I did not disclose a party preference when I registered to vote.  What ballot will I \n11  receive?”  See id. ¶ 9, Ex. D at 12-13.  The answer provided to the latter question is:  \nAll voters, regardless of party preference, can vote in contests for voter-\n12 \nnominated offices, nonpartisan offices, and ballot measures. For the June 7 \nelection, three parties will allow voters with no party preference to participate in \n13 \ntheir presidential primary elections: the American Independent Party, the \nDemocratic Party, and the Libertarian Party. You can request to vote in one of \n14 \nthese party primaries, or you will receive a ballot with no presidential contest. \n15  If you vote by mail: you may request a party ballot by indicating your choice on \nthe Vote-by-Mail Application on the back cover of this pamphlet. The \n16  Department of Elections must receive this application no later than  5 p.m. on \nMay 31. \n17 \nIf you vote in person: you may request the ballot of your choice from a poll \nworker when you sign the roster. \n18 \n19  See id.  The VIP also provides an easy-to-understand flow chart explaining that NPP voters may vote \n20  in any of the three designated presidential primaries, whereas voters registered for a political party \n21  may only vote in the party’s presidential primary.  See id. ¶ 9, Ex. D at 13.4  In addition, a letter from \n22 \n                                                 \n23  3 Plaintiffs allege that the portion of the Department’s website that allows voters to sign up to \nreceive a vote-by-mail ballot “failed to provide the mandatory notice to all voters of their right to state \n24  no party preference, and further, that a no party preference voter shall be provided with a Democratic, \nAmerican Independent Party or a Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot.”  (Docket No. 29 at 15; \n25  see also Dec. of James Roguski, ¶ 8.)  This is wrong.  As noted above, after a voter enters his house \nnumber, zip code, and date of birth, the website will indicate whether or not he has expressed a party \n26  preference.  Arntz Dec., ¶ 11, Ex. I.  If he is an NPP voter, the website informs him that he may \nrequest a ballot to vote in one of three presidential primaries, and includes a link to request such a \n27  ballot.  See id. ¶ 11, Ex. I.   \n4 Plaintiffs allege that the VIP did not properly inform “voters that were members of political \n28 \nparties” of their “right to state no party preference.”  (Docket No. 29 at 15.)  This is false, as the VIP \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

D at 4.   \n4  Eighth, on April 5, 2016, the Department sent a mailer to every household in San Francisco—\n5  over 362,000 in all—reminding them to vote and stating: “To learn what’s on the ballot and why your \n6  political party preference makes a difference in the Presidential Primary, go to sfelections.org/ \n7  June2016.”  See id. ¶ 14, Ex. M.  That link, among other things, informs NPP voters that they can vote \n8  in the presidential primary for any of the three designated parties.  See id. ¶ 14, Ex. N.6   \n9  Ninth, the Department has issued five press releases advising that, “Voters who did not select a \n10  party preference when registering to vote, will receive a ballot that does not include a presidential \n11  contest unless they request a ballot of one of the parties allowing voters with no party preference to \n12  participate in their presidential primaries.”  See id. ¶ 15, Ex. O.  Those press releases explain how NPP \n13  voters can select a presidential primary ballot.   \n14  Tenth, the Department maintains an active social medial presence, regularly issuing tweets and \n15  Facebook updates informing NPP voters that they can vote in one of the primaries.  See id. ¶ 16, Ex. P.  \n16  For example, on April 8, the Department issued a Tweet and Facebook post to its more than 1,500 \n17  combined followers stating: “June 7 no party preference voting for president?” and attached a \n18  flowchart informing NPP voters the presidential primaries in which they are entitled to vote.  See id. \n19  Similarly, on May 10, 2016, the Department posted: “Registered ‘no party’?  Check your vote-by-mail \n20  ballot.  You can request Al, Dem, or Lib party ballot.”  See id.  And on May 2, 2016, the Department \n21 \n                                                 \n22  informs all voters that they may change their party preference and explains how to do so.  Arntz Dec. ¶ \n21, Ex D. \n23 \n5 Plaintiffs urge the Court to disregard the VIP because, “A substantial portion of the \npopulation struggles with functional illiteracy and cannot be expected to drink from a firehose of \n24 \ninformation.”  (Docket No. 29 at 23-24.)  But the VIP is written for people at an eighth grade reading \nlevel and is remarkably easy to understand.  Arntz Dec. ¶ 9.  In any event, even if one disregards the \n25 \nVIP, many of the Department’s other outreach efforts focus exclusively on the NPP issue and are a far \ncry from a “firehose of information.”   \n26 \n6 Many of the documents, websites, and ballots referenced above are available in English, \n27  Spanish, Chinese, and Filipino.  Arntz Dec., ¶ 19.  The Department provides voters with multiple \nopportunities to select their preferred language, and once the voter has expressed a preference, all \n28  materials sent to that voter will be in English and that language.

Confirm your political party preference.”  See id. \n2  That post provided links to the Department’s website further explaining this issue and providing tools \n3  for vote-by-mail voters to request a presidential primary ballot.  See id. \n4  Eleventh, the Department maintains a voter outreach desk that is staffed by people who are \n5  knowledgeable about how to change party preference and how to request crossover ballots, among \n6  other issues.  See id. ¶ 17.  Any person with questions can call the help desk number, which the \n7  Department publishes in numerous locations, or come into the Department and speak with voter \n8  outreach personnel.  See id. ¶ 17, Ex. A-C, E-I, K-R, T. \n9  Finally, the Department has conducted an extensive outreach campaign to educate voters about \n10  a host of issues, including the implications of being an NPP voter and how to obtain a crossover ballot.  \n11  See id. ¶ 18.  In all, the Department has provided informational materials to over 700 civic partners \n12  through a variety of means.  See id.  For example, Department representatives distribute materials and \n13  provide presentations at events, fairs, and festivals across the City.  See id. ¶ 18, Ex. Q, R.  The \n14  Department pays to post informational materials on the interior of 1,000 Muni vehicles, the exterior of \n15  100 Muni vehicles, and inside 22 Muni and BART stations.  See id. ¶ 19, Ex. S.  The Department also \n16  delivers and mails the materials to community-based organizations, such as Chinese for Affirmative \n17  Action, LGBT Community Center, and the Mission Economic Development Agency, as well as to \n18  schools, City departments, and libraries.  See id. ¶ 19, Ex. Q.  Finally, the Department has placed ads \n19  in local newspapers such as San Francisco Examiner, SF Weekly, Bay Area Reporter, 14 San \n20  Francisco neighborhood newspapers, the Asian Journal, Philippine News, Vietnam Daily News, Sing \n21  Tao, World Journal, La Opinion de la Bahia, El Tecolote, Nichi Bei Weekly, and the Korean Times.  \n22  See id. ¶ 18, Ex. T.   \nIV.  THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO MADE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO INFORM \n23 \nVOTERS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED A PARTY PREFERENCE THAT THEY MAY \nCHANGE THAT PREFERENCE. \n24 \n25  Although Plaintiffs’ claims focus primarily on the information provided to NPP voters, \n26  Plaintiffs also accuse the Department of failing to notify voters with a party preference that they have \n27  the ability to switch parties.  (See, e.g., Docket No. 29 at 15.)  To the contrary, the Department’s \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

See id. ¶ 20. \n3  First, the VIP, which contains a discussion of “Voting in the June 2016 Presidential Primary \n4  Election” states:  \nHow can I change my party preference? \n5 \nIf you want to change your political party preference, you must reregister to \n6  vote. The registration deadline for the June 7 election is May 23.  \nReregister at registertovote.ca.gov, or call the Department of Elections at (415) \n7 \n554-4375 to request that a voter registration card be mailed to you. You may \nalso fill out a voter registration card in person at the Department of Elections in \n8 \nCity Hall. \n9 \nSee id. ¶ 21, Ex. D at 12-13. \n10 \nSecond, every envelope containing a vote-by-mail ballot sent to San Francisco voters includes \n11 \na “Voting Instructions” guide that states: “If you chose a party preference when you registered to vote, \n12 \nthe enclosed ballot includes, among other contests, all contests specific to that party. If you want to \n13 \nchange your political party preference, you must reregister to vote by May 23.”  See id. ¶ 22, Ex. B.  \n14 \nThis guide is also available on the Department’s website, on a portion of the site devoted to “Voting in \n15 \nthe June 7, 2016, Election.”  See id.   \n16 \nThird, every voter who uses the Department’s voter registration tool to determine if he is \n17 \nregistered to vote, the political party for which he is registered, and his polling place, is informed that \n18 \nhe may change his party preference: \n19 \nIf you want to change your party preference, name, or home address in time for \nthis election, you must reregister by May 23 at registertovote.ca.gov. \n20 \nAlternatively, you may call (415) 554-4375 for a registration form to be mailed \nto you.  \n21 \nTo make changes to your voter registration, or to register to vote, please go to \n22  the Secretary of State website for a registration form or more information. You \ncan also obtain a voter registration card from the Department of Motor Vehicles \n23  (DMV), public libraries, or post offices. \n24 \nSee id. ¶ 23, Ex. F-G.   \n25 \n  Fourth, as noted above, the Department sent a mailer to every household in San Francisco—\n26 \nover 362,000.  See id. ¶ 24, Ex. M.

See id. ¶ 25, Ex. M-O, R-\n6  T.   \n7  Finally, the Department has provided information about how voters can change party \n8  preference via its social media posts, its help desk, and its press releases, all of which are described \n9  above.  \nV.  PROCEDURES FOR VOTING BY MAIL IN SAN FRANCISCO. \n10 \nA.  The Use of April 18 on the Department’s Mailers Informing NPP Voters Who \n11  Have Already Applied to Vote by Mail that They May Request a Crossover Ballot. \n12 \nAs noted above, the Department sent mailers to all NPP voters who have already applied to \n13 \nvote by mail informing them that they may request a crossover ballot.  See id. ¶ 31, Ex. A.  Those \n14 \nforms state, among other things: “To request a ballot that includes the presidential primary contest of \n15 \none of these parties, mark the name of the party on the attached postage-paid postcard, and sign and \n16 \nreturn the postcard no later than April 18. If you do not request the ballot of one of these parties, your \n17 \nballot will not include a contest for President.”  See id.  (emphasis added). \n18 \nThe Department’s goal is for voters to receive their vote-by-mail ballots three to four weeks \n19 \nbefore Election Day.   See id. ¶ 32.  The use of the April 18 date on the mailers is not legally mandated \n20 \nbut it is based on the operational requirements of the Department and the third-party vendor with \n21 \nwhich the Department contracts to print and assemble vote-by-mail ballots.  See id.  255,000 of San \n22 \nFrancisco’s 467,000 registered voters have applied to vote by mail.  See id.  Given that substantial \n23 \nnumber, the vendor, which also contracts with numerous other counties in California and other states, \n24 \nrequested two weeks to print and assemble the ballots, then have them driven from Washington to a \n25 \nUnited States Post Office facility in Richmond, where they were placed in the mail.  See id.  Shortly \n26 \nafter April 18, the Department sent the vendor an “extract” containing the information regarding which \n27 \nSan Francisco voters had applied to receive vote-by-mail ballots and the ballots those voters should \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.  10 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01110025.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 33   Filed 05/31/16   Page 16 of 30\n \n1  receive.  See id.  The batch of ballots generated from that extract was placed in the mail in San \n2  Francisco on May 4 and 5, 2016, See id., such that voters likely received them three to four weeks \n3  before Election Day.   \n4  After sending the initial extract to the vendor, the Department sends supplemental extracts on a \n5  regular basis.  See id. ¶ 33.  Once an NPP voter who has applied to vote by mail submits a request for a \n6  crossover ballot, the minimum amount of time that the vendor can process that request is \n7  approximately 72 hours, plus mailing time.  See id.  Larger extracts can take the vendor up to two \n8  weeks to process.  See id.    The vendor mails vote-by-mail ballots generated from supplemental \n9  extracts from Washington, not San Francisco; as such, mailing times are longer.  See id.   \n10  The Department promptly transmits to the vendor all requests for crossover ballots from NPP \n11  voters, including requests received after April 18.  See id. ¶ 34.  Thus, NPP voters who have applied to \n12  vote by mail and who have submitted their request for a crossover ballot will receive one, even if they \n13  submitted that request after April 18 (so long as the Department receives the request with enough time \n14  to provide the voter with a replacement ballot by Election Day). 7  See id.   \n15  Plaintiffs take issue with this statement on the Department’s mailers: “To request a ballot that \n16  includes the presidential primary contest of one of these parties, mark the name of the party on the \n17  attached postage-paid postcard, and sign and return the postcard no later than April 18. If you do not \n18  request the ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not include a contest for President.”  \n19  However, this statement is accurate:  NPP voters who did not submit the form by April 18 received  \n20  ballots that did not include a contest for President.  See id. ¶ 35.  This is because, immediately after \n21  April 18, the Department sent the extract to the vendor, which printed and assembled the ballots and \n22  drove them to Richmond, where they were mailed on May 4 and 5.  See id.  Such voters, however, \n23  were also informed—through the numerous ways explained above, including the Voting Instructions \n24  guide included in every vote-by-mail ballot envelope—that they could still vote in a presidential \n                                                 \n25 \n7 The declaration of Tanya Mena (Docket No. 14-1) supports this aspect of Director Arntz’s \ntestimony.  As explained in greater detail in Section VI, the reason Ms. Mena received her Democratic \n26 \nprimary ballot is because she returned her mailer to the Department after April 18, not because she re-\nregistered to vote as a Democrat.  See Arntz Dec. ¶¶ 39-40.  Indeed, she is still registered as an NPP \n27 \nvoter.  See id. ¶ 40. \n28   \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

See id.  A link to that ballot replacement request form is \n2  included on the Voting Instructions guide.  See id., Ex. B.     \n3  Plaintiffs have argued that the Department’s mailers should not have used April 18, but \n4  instead, a much later date given that NPP voters who have applied to vote by mail can technically \n5  request a crossover ballot much closer to Election Day.  However, a later date would be infeasible \n6  from an operational standpoint.  See id. ¶ 36.  If, for example, the Department used May 31 as the \n7  deadline, voters who submitted their request on that date would not receive their vote-by-mail ballot in \n8  time to cast it.  See id.  A large extract would take the vendor two weeks to process, plus the time it \n9  would take to mail the ballots from Washington, which can be 10 days or more.  See id.  \nB.  The June 1 Deadline for Receiving Requests for Replacement Vote-by-Mail \n10 \nBallots By Voters Who Have Already Applied to Vote by Mail. \n11 \nPlaintiffs have also taken issue with the fact that the Department’s ballot replacement request \n12 \nform states that the Department must receive the request by June 1.  In Plaintiffs’ view, June 1 is \n13 \ninaccurate, because the deadline to apply to vote-by-mail is May 31.  (See Docket No. 12, ¶ 11; \n14 \nDocket No. 27, ¶ 5.)  Plaintiffs, however, misunderstand the purpose of the ballot replacement request \n15 \nform. \n16 \nThat form, which is entitled “Replacement Ballot Request for Voters with No Party \n17 \nPreference” states, among other things: “To request a replacement ballot of one of these parties, \n18 \ncomplete the form below and return it to the Department as soon as possible to ensure it reaches us by \n19 \nWednesday, June 1.  A replacement ballot will be sent to you if the information on this form is \n20 \ncomplete and accurate.”  See id., ¶ 37, Ex. C.  Critically, this form is not an application to vote by \n21 \nmail.  Rather, its purpose is to allow a person who has already applied to vote by mail to obtain a \n22 \nreplacement vote-by-mail ballot.  See id.  For this reason, the form does not state that the deadline to \n23 \napply to vote by mail is June 1; but rather, it says that a person who has already applied to vote by mail \n24 \nmay obtain a replacement ballot (that includes a crossover ballot) by submitting the form to the \n25 \nDepartment by June 1.  See id.    \n26 \nThe Department must receive replacement requests by June 1 in order to ensure that voters \n27 \nreceive their replacement ballots in time to actually cast their votes.

See id.  \n3  After ballot replacement requests are received, the Department must process them, compile a \n4  replacement ballot, then mail it to the voter.   See id.  Requests received after June 1 run the risk of not \n5  reaching the voter until after Election Day, after which point the vote could not be counted.  See Cal. \n6  Elections Code § 3020.   \nVI.  THE DECLARATIONS SUBMITTED BY PLAINTIFFS DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR \n7 \nCASE. \n8 \nPlaintiffs include several declarations in support of their motion, few of which pertain to San \n9 \nFrancisco.8  Those that do are unhelpful to Plaintiffs’ case.  \n10 \nTanya Mena alleges that she “changed her registration to Democratic so I was certain I could \n11 \nvote for a Democratic candidate in the Presidential primary.”  (Docket No. 14-1, ¶ 1; see also ¶ 3.)  \n12 \nThis is not accurate.  Ms. Mena registered to vote in San Francisco in 2014 as an NPP voter, and she \n13 \nhas not re-registered.  Arntz Dec., ¶¶ 39-40.  Because Ms. Mena has applied to vote-by-mail, the \n14 \nDepartment sent a mailer, which she returned to the Department, requesting a ballot for the \n15 \nDemocratic presidential primary.  See id.  Upon receipt of Ms. Mena’s request, the Department mailed \n16 \nto Ms. Mena, on May 13, 2016, a ballot for the Democratic presidential primary.  See id.  In other \n17 \nwords, the reason she received her ballot is not because she re-registered, but because she submitted \n18 \nthe mailer.  See id.  This is consistent with Director Arntz’s testimony that NPP voters who have \n19 \napplied to vote by mail who submit their request for a crossover ballot will receive one, even if they \n20 \nsubmitted that request after April 18.  See id. \n21 \nPlaintiffs also submit the Declaration of Claire Daims, who is an NPP voter.  (Docket No. 14-\n22 \n2.)  Ms. Daims indicates that she is worried that there will not be sufficient Democratic ballots.  \n23 \n(Docket No. 14-2, ¶ 3.)  This concern is unfounded (and lacks any basis in personal knowledge), as the \n24 \nDepartment has ordered ballots for all parties far in excess of what will realistically be needed.  Arntz \n25 \nDec., ¶ 41.

Plaintiffs’ counsel first contacted the Department of Elections via \n15  email on Friday, May 13, 2016, stating:  \nPlease take notice that on Monday, 5/16/16, I am filing in federal court to seek a \n16 \nTRO for injunctive/declaratory relief re: Election Code 3006 violations. The \nvote by mail applications provided to SF residents has incorrect information, \n17 \nincluding but not limited to not providing the info on how to provide Democrat, \nAIP and Libertarian ballots to “no party preference” voters. I will call on \n18 \nMonday about when and where in federal court the TRO will be heard. \n19 \nDeclaration of Joshua White (“White Dec.”), Ex. A.  In response, the Department’s attorney, Joshua \n20 \nWhite, spoke by phone with Plaintiffs’ counsel, explained to him that the Department complies with \n21 \nits obligations under Elections Code § 3006, and further explained where the information required by \n22 \nthat section can be found on the Department’s website and mailers.  Id. ¶ 2.  In addition, on Monday, \n23 \nMay 16, 2016, the Department’s attorney emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel, informing him:  \n24 \nI’m going to do my best to respond to each of the concerns you raise. I’m \nhopeful and confident that we can avoid going to court.  As you will see below, \n25 \nthe Department’s website and mailers comply with all applicable provisions of \nthe California and Municipal Elections. \n26 \n27  Id., Ex. B.

Id., Ex. B.   \n3    Plaintiffs’ counsel did not reply to the email, id. ¶ 3, and filed his lawsuit on Friday, May 20, \n4  2016.  On Monday, May 23, 2016, the Department’s attorney called Plaintiffs’ counsel and inquired as \n5  to whether he would be seeking pre-election relief, and if so, on what timeline.  Id. ¶ 3.  Plaintiffs’ \n6  counsel responded that his hope was to seek ex parte relief and to provide his motion to the \n7  Department by the following day (i.e., Tuesday, May 24).  There was no further communication from \n8  Plaintiffs’ counsel until Thursday, May 26 at 4:24 p.m., when Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the \n9  Department’s attorney by email: “We will be filing our ex parte request - seeking to shorten time for \n10  hearing on a preliminary injunction - and seeking to make this request to Judge Alsup himself at 3 \n11  pm.”  Id., Ex. C.  Before sending that email, Plaintiffs’ counsel had made no effort to confer about a \n12  schedule.  Id. ¶ 5.  Upon receiving this email, the Department’s attorney asked Plaintiffs’ counsel to \n13  provide a proposed schedule as well as the statutory or other basis for Plaintiffs’ motion to shorten \n14  time.  Id., Ex. D.  Despite this request and in violation of Civil Local Rule 6-3(a), Plaintiffs’ counsel \n15  never proposed a schedule and never provided the basis for his authority.  Id. ¶ 5.   \n16  On Friday, May 27, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to serve “[t]he summons, complaint, motion, \n17  and all supporting declarations, as well as this order on defendants by TOMORROW, MAY 28 at \n18  4:00 P.M.”  (emphasis in original).  Plaintiffs have failed to do any of these things—none of the \n19  moving papers or supporting declarations have been provided to the Department,9 Arntz Dec. ¶ 42, \n20  and although Plaintiffs e-filed their memorandum of points and authorities before 4:00 p.m. on May \n21  28, the last line of that document stated that “plaintiffs will fix the word processing errors and ask \n22  permission to file a modified brief at 5 pm, in one hour.”  (Docket No. 28 at 19) (emphasis added).  To \n23  the Department’s knowledge, Plaintiffs never received permission, but nonetheless, more than an hour \n24                                                   \n9 Indeed, Defendant Arntz has not even been properly served in this action.  A suit against an \n25  official in his official capacity is tantamount to a suit against the entity for which he is employed.  \nLuke v. Abbott, 954 F.Supp. 202, 203 (C.D. Cal., March 5, 1997) (“Official capacity suits are generally \n26  another way of pleading an action against an entity of which the officer is an agent.”).  Here, as the \nDepartment is not an independent legal entity, the actual defendant is the City and County of San \n27  Francisco, which can only be served by delivering a summons and complaint to the Mayor’s Office or \nthe Board of Supervisors.  See City and County of San Francisco, Charter (1996), Article XIII, Section \n28  13.104 (creating the Department of Elections).   Plaintiffs have failed to do either. \nOpp. of S.F.

(Docket No. 29.)  \n3  In short, Plaintiffs informed the Department that they planned to file a motion on May 16 but \n4  then failed to file or to communicate with counsel for the Department over the next ten days, finally \n5  filed their motion on the 11th day, and filed a memorandum of points and authorities (after the Court’s \n6  deadline) on the 12th day.  Plaintiffs’ counsel alleges that they spent that time investigating potential \n7  violations of law, but their May 28 filing demonstrates no such thing. \nARGUMENT \n8 \n9  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the \n10  merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance \n11  of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Natural \n12  Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Plaintiffs fall short on every element of the \n13  Winter test.   \nI.  PLAINTIFFS CANNOT ESTABLISH A LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE \n14 \nMERITS.   \n15  A.  The Department Did Not Violate the Voting Rights Act. \n16 \nPlaintiffs argue that the Department violated two provisions of the Voting Rights Act—52 \n17 \nU.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A) and 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B).  Neither of those provisions applies here. \n18 \nSubsection (A) states: \n19  No person acting under color of law shall in determining whether any individual \nis qualified under State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, \n20  practice, or procedure different from the standards, practices, or procedures \napplied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same county, \n21  parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found by State officials to \nbe qualified to vote.... \n22 \nThat provision “was designed to eliminate practices that could encumber an individual’s ability \n23 \nto register to vote.”  Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F.Supp.2d 1356, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (citing Schwier v. \n24 \nCox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2003).  In Friedman, which Plaintiffs cite as “the best guidance in \n25 \nthis situation,” see Docket No. 29 at 20, the court rejected the plaintiff’s Voting Rights Act claim \n26 \nbecause “[t]he error and omission alleged here did not pertain to determining eligibility to vote.”  345 \n27 \nF.Supp.2d at 1372.  Like Friedman, this case has nothing to do with voter registration.  Rather, \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

Section 10101(a)(2)(A) does not apply.   \n3  Even if subsection (A) applies to people who have already registered, Plaintiffs’ claim still \n4  fails.  Plaintiffs’ primary argument is that the Department was obligated to provide all voters, \n5  including those who have disclosed a party preference, with the language required by Elections Code § \n6  3006(c), which states that vote-by-mail applications \nshall inform the voter that if he or she has declined to disclose a preference for a \n7 \npolitical party, the voter may request a vote by mail ballot for a particular \npolitical party for the partisan primary election, if that political party has \n8 \nadopted a party rule, duly noticed to the Secretary of State, authorizing that \nvote. The application shall contain a toll-free telephone number, established by \n9 \nthe Secretary of State, that the voter may call to access information regarding \nwhich political parties have adopted such a rule. The application shall contain a \n10 \ncheckoff box with a conspicuously printed statement that reads substantially \nsimilar to the following: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified \n11 \npolitical party. However, for this primary election only, I request a vote by mail \nballot for the _________ Party.”  The name of the political party shall be \n12 \npersonally affixed by the voter.10 \n13 \n(emphasis added).  But it makes no sense to provide that statement to party preference voters for the \n14 \nprecise reason that they have chosen to “disclose a preference for a qualified political party.”   \n15 \n  Subsection (A) does not require that every single voter be provided with identical information \n16 \nat the identical moment.  In Gonzalez v. State of Arizona, 2006 WL 3627297, at *8 (D. Ariz., Sept. 11, \n17 \n2006), an Arizona law required different types of identification depending on whether an individual is \n18 \nregistering to vote or verifying identity on election day.  Id. at *1.  The Court upheld the law, noting: \n19 \n“It is not a violation of subsection (A) for a state to apply different standards to two inherently \n20 \ndifferent procedures.”  Id. at *8.  Similarly, it would make no sense to require the Department to \n21 \ninform voters who have disclosed a party preference that they have not disclosed a party preference.  \n22 \nIn any event, as a factual matter, the Department has provided abundant information to all San \n23 \nFranciscans, both registered and unregistered, about how to vote in the presidential primary and how \n24 \n25 \n26                                                   \n10 Elections Code § 3007.7(e) clarifies that Elections Code § 3006(c) applies to online vote-by-\n27  mail applications: “Except as provided in Section 3007.5 and this section, all other sections of this \ncode pertaining to vote by mail voter applications, submissions, deadlines, and canvassing shall apply \n28  to electronic vote by mail ballot applications and applicants.” \nOpp. of S.F.

See Arntz Dec. ¶¶ 2-27, Ex. A-T.  Plaintiffs’ claim under Subsection (A) \n2  fails. \n3  Plaintiffs’ claim under Subsection (B)—sometimes referred to as the Voting Rights Act’s \n4  “materiality provision”—is equally meritless.  That provision states: \nNo person acting under color of law may deny the right of any individual to \n5 \nvote in any election because of an error or omission on any record or paper \nrelating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such \n6 \nerror or omission is not material in determining whether such individual is \nqualified under State law to vote in such election. \n7 \n8  Subsection (B), in other words, “prohibits denying the right to vote based on errors or \n9  omissions that are not material in determining voter eligibility.”  Florida State Conference of \n10  N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1173 (11th Cir. 2008).  Originally enacted as part of the Civil \n11  Rights Act of 1964, Subsection (B) was part of the federal government’s effort to enforce voting rights \n12  and “counteract state and local government tactics of using, among other things, burdensome \n13  registration requirements to disenfranchise African–Americans.”  Id.  \n14  In Plaintiffs’ view, the Department has denied the right of party preference voters to vote by \n15  omitting the statement required by Elections Code § 3006 from both on the online vote-by-mail \n16  application and the back cover of the VIP; and by failing to inform voters that they can hand deliver \n17  their vote-by-mail applications to the Department.  But there is no evidence or even any realistic \n18  possibility that the Department has denied anyone the right to vote.  To the contrary, the Department \n19  has gone to great lengths to inform all party preference voters they can re-register, see Arntz Dec., ¶¶ \n20  20-30, and that they can drop off their vote-by-mail applications at the Department.  See id. ¶ 29.  It is \n21  true that the vote-by-mail application on the back cover of the VIP provided to party preference voters \n22  does not state: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party.”  The reason is \n23  that, by definition, party preference voters have “disclose[d] a preference for a qualified political \n24  party.”  For the same reason, the Department does not post that statement on the first page of the \n25  online vote-by-mail application—not all people who are applying to vote online have “declined to \n26  disclose a preference for a qualified political party.”  Quite rightly, the Department has opted to avoid \n27  confusing voters. \n28 \nOpp. of S.F.

The Department Did Not Violate the Constitution.  \n1 \nPlaintiffs claim that the Department violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth \n2 \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  To assess the constitutionality of election laws, courts apply a \n3 \n“flexible standard” that weighs the burdens of such regulation against the government’s interests in \n4 \nenacting those laws.  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).  Focusing on “the extent to which \n5 \na challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendments rights,” the Court has applied the \n6 \nfollowing test:   \n7 \n . . . when those rights are subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be \n8  narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.  But when \na state election law provision imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory \n9  restrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, the \nState’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the \n10  restrictions. \n11 \nId. at 434 (quotations and citations omitted).  If the burden is severe, the regulation is subject to strict \n12 \nscrutiny; if the challenged regulation is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, it may be justified by \n13 \nimportant regulatory interests.  The Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have consistently applied this \n14 \nbalancing approach in considering First Amendment, Due Process, and Equal Protection challenges to \n15 \nelection laws.  See Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 (9th Cir. 2011); Lemons v. Bradbury, \n16 \n538 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir. 2008).  Courts have occasionally described the test for reasonable, \n17 \nnondiscriminatory regulations as a “rational basis” test, Libertarian Party of Washington v. Munro, 31 \n18 \nF.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir. 1994), under which a plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged regulation \n19 \nis “not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Arizona Libertarian Party v. Reagan, 798 F.3d \n20 \n723, 733-34 (9th Cir. 2015).   \n21 \nApplying this standard, the courts have upheld a myriad of election regulations as reasonable \n22 \nand non-discriminatory, even where there is a significant possibility that they would burden voters.  \n23 \nSee, e.g., Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181, 185, 202-03 (2008) (plurality \n24 \nopinion) (voter identification); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 760-62 (1973) (advance \n25 \nenrollment requirement for party primary elections); Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686, 686-87 (1973) \n26 \n(requirement that voters register at least 50 days prior to election); Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679, \n27 \n680-81 (1973) (requirement that voters reside in jurisdiction for 50 days prior to registration); see also \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim.

DiStefano, 37 F.3d 726, 729 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994) (“It is, of course, well established \n2  that states may restrict the voting privilege through residency and other requirements.”).   \n3    In the present case, Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden.  Indeed, it is difficult to even evaluate \n4  Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim since it is unclear what that claim actually entails.  To the extent \n5  Plaintiffs are claiming that it was unconstitutional for the Department not to provide the statement in \n6  Elections Code § 3006(c) to both NPP and non-NPP voters, this argument fails.  That statement is \n7  designed specifically to provide information to NPP voters, and it would be unduly confusing for \n8  voters who have disclosed a preference for a qualified political party to receive a statement stating: “I \n9  have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party.”  Rather than sow confusion, the \n10  Department has, as described above, made extensive efforts to educate voters about the upcoming \n11  presidential primary election and the implications of being an NPP voter or being a party-affiliated \n12  voter.  Far from burdening the voting rights of San Franciscans, the Department has gone to great \n13  lengths to help San Franciscans realize those rights.  \n14    To the extent that Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim relies on the use of the April 18 deadline, that \n15  claim is meritless as there is no evidence that the use of this deadline burdened voting rights of even \n16  one person, and even if it did, that burden was minimal and justified by the Department’s operational \n17  needs.  To the extent that Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim relies on the supposedly erroneous use of the \n18  June 1 deadline on the replacement ballot request form, that claim fails because it imposes no burden \n19  on voters; and it is justified by the operational needs of the Department. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Request for a Writ of Mandamus for Alleged Violations of State Law \n20 \nFails. \n21  1.  The Statute Under Which Plaintiffs Seek Mandamus Relief—28 U.S.C. § \n1361—Does Not Authorize An Injunction Against a Local Official for \n22  Violations of State Law. \n23 \nPlaintiffs seek a writ of mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  However, that statute does not \n24 \nauthorize federal courts to enjoin the conduct of state or local officials.  The statute states: “The \n25 \ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an \n26 \nofficer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  \n27 \n(emphasis added).

See Barber v. Beard, 2015 WL \n2  506254, at *6 (S.D. Cal., Feb. 5, 2015) (“But under the plain language of [28 U.S.C. § 1361], federal \n3  district courts do not have mandamus jurisdiction over state officials.”); Ciacci v. Hawaii Government, \n4  2012 WL 6697569, at *2 (D. Hawaii, Dec. 24, 2012) (“28 U.S.C. § 1361 provides district courts with \n5  jurisdiction in the nature of mandamus to compel officers or employees of the United States—not state \n6  agencies or actors like those named as Defendants in this action—to perform a duty owed to a \n7  plaintiff.”); Newton v. Poindexter, 578 F.Supp. 277, 279 (E.D. Cal., Jan. 18, 1984) (holding that \n8  federal courts cannot compel action by state officials under 28 U.S.C. § 1361).  Thus, all of Plaintiffs’ \n9  claims premised on alleged violations of state law fail. \n2.  Even If This Court Had Jurisdiction Under 28 U.S.C. § 1361, the \n10 \nDepartment Did Not Violate the California Elections Code. \n11 \nPlaintiffs allege that the Department violated provisions of the California Elections Code.  \n12 \nEach alleged violation is discussed in turn below.   \n13 \nFirst, according to Plaintiffs, the Department’s online vote-by-mail application feature violates \n14 \nElections Code Sections 3006(c) and 3007.7(e).  In Plaintiffs’ view, the tool does not “provide the \n15 \nmandatory notice to all voters of their right to state no party preference; and, further, that a no party \n16 \npreference voter shall be provided with a Democratic, American Independent Party or a Libertarian \n17 \nParty Presidential primary ballot.”  (Docket No. 29 at 15.)  In support of this argument, Plaintiffs cite a \n18 \nlink to the first page of the Department’s voter registration tool—http://sfelections.org/tools/vbmapp/ \n19 \nindex.php.   \n20 \nPlaintiffs’ argument ignores the fact that the Department’s online vote-by-mail application \n21 \nfeature is two-step process, and though the cover page does not include the language from Section \n22 \n3006(c), the second page does.  As described above, once a voter inputs his house number, zip code, \n23 \nand date of birth, the Department determines if that person is an NPP voter.  Arntz Dec. ¶ 11, Ex. H, I.  \n24 \nIf so, the next page provides the voter with the information required by Section 3006(c) and includes a \n25 \nlink to a vote-by-mail application that includes the language required by Section 3006(c).  See id. ¶ 11, \n26 \nEx. I-J.  It would make no sense for the first page of the online vote-by-mail application feature to \n27 \ninclude the information required by Section 3006(c) since the all voters see the first page.

But again, it \n8  is nonsensical to construe Section 3006(c) to mean that voters who have disclosed a preference for a \n9  qualified political party must receive a statement saying: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a \n10  qualified political party.”  To be sure, other parts of the VIP as well as the Department’s outreach \n11  efforts, inform voters who have selected a political party that how to change their party preference and \n12  the implications of doing so for June 7 election.11 \n13  Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Department has not properly notified people registering to vote \n14  by mail that they may personally deliver their application to the Department in City Hall.  (Docket No. \n15  29 at 16.)  But as noted above, when an NPP voter fills out an application to vote by mail on the \n16  Department’s website, the website states: “You may mail, deliver or fax the form to the address or fax \n17  number listed on the application.”  Arntz Dec., ¶ 29, Ex I (emphasis added).  In addition, the \n18  application itself states, “Deliver, mail, or fax the completed application to the address or fax number \n19  listed below.”  See id., Ex. J.  (emphasis added).  Though the Department’s mailers that included vote-\n20  by-mail applications did not explicitly inform voters that they may hand deliver their applications to \n21  the Department, the applications included the Department’s address and paid for the postage.  And in \n22 \n                                                 \n11 Plaintiffs also fault the Department for deviating from the California Secretary of State’s \n23 \nuniform vote by mail application.  (Docket No. 29 at 15.)  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, \nthe Department’s vote by mail application conforms in all material respects to the Secretary of State’s \n24 \napplication.  See Arntz Dec., Ex. J, U.  And even if it did not, Elections Code § 3007 does not require \nthe Department to follow the same format: “The Secretary of State shall prepare and distribute to \n25 \nappropriate elections officials a uniform application format for a vote by mail voter's ballot that \nconforms to this chapter. This format shall be followed by all individuals, organizations, and groups \n26 \nwho distribute applications for a vote by mail voter's ballot. The uniform format need not be utilized by \nelections officials in preparing a vote by mail voter's ballot application to be included with the sample \n27 \nballot.”  (emphasis added). \n28   \nOpp. of S.F.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT SUFFERED AND WILL NOT SUFFER ANY INJURY, \n4 \nMUCH LESS AN IRREPARABLE ONE. \n5 \nA preliminary injunction may only be granted when the moving party has demonstrated a real \n6 \nlikelihood of irreparable injury or harm.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 21.  “Speculative injury does not \n7 \nconstitute irreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a preliminary injunction.  A plaintiff must \n8 \ndo more than merely allege imminent harm sufficient to establish standing; a plaintiff must \n9 \ndemonstrate immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief.”  Caribbean \n10 \nMarine Servs. Co., Inc. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988) (emphasis in original; internal \n11 \ncitations omitted).  A preliminary injunction cannot issue based only on the possibility of some remote \n12 \nfuture injury because “injunctive relief [is] an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \n13 \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. \n14 \n  Because interim injunctions “are generally granted under the theory that there is an urgent need \n15 \nfor speedy action to protect the plaintiffs’ rights,” a plaintiff’s delay “tends to indicate at least a \n16 \nreduced need for such drastic, speedy action.”  Citibank v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985).  \n17 \n“By sleeping on its rights a plaintiff demonstrates the lack of need” for preliminary relief.  Lydo \n18 \nEnterprises, Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 F.2d 1211 (9th Cir. 1984) (cites and quotes omitted).  A \n19 \n“long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.”  \n20 \nOakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985). \n21 \nPlaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they or any San Francisco voter will suffer an injury, \n22 \nmuch less an irreparable one.  As described above, the Department has gone to great lengths to educate \n23 \nNPP voters that they can vote in one of the presidential primaries and non-NPP voters that they re-\n24 \nregister.  All NPP voters who vote at a polling place will be informed (both by poll workers and by a \n25 \nsign) that they can vote in one of the primaries.  All NPP voters who applied to vote by mail have been \n26 \ninformed on multiple occasions that they can vote in one of the primaries.  Similarly, the Department’s \n27 \noutreach efforts have informed all San Francisco residents that they can register and/or re-register to \n28 \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.  23 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01110025.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 33   Filed 05/31/16   Page 29 of 30\n \n1  vote.  Finally, the fact that Plaintiffs’ waited 15 days to seek relief—from May 13 when their lawyer \n2  first contacted the Department until May 28 when they filed the instant motion—undercuts the \n3  credibility of their claims about the existence and magnitude of injury that would befall the San \n4  Francisco electorate without emergency relief.   \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS AND PUBLIC INTEREST STRONGLY FAVOR \n5 \nDENYING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION. \n6 \nIn “balanc[ing] the hardships of the public interest against a private interest, the public interest \n7 \nshould receive greater weight.”  Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Affordable Media, LLC, 179 F.3d 1228, 1236 \n8 \n(9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Fed. Trade Comm’n v. World Wide Factors, Ltd., 882 F.2d 344, 347 (9th Cir. \n9 \n1989)).  In the elections context, the Court should act with particular caution because “[c]ourt orders \n10 \naffecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and \n11 \nconsequent incentive to remain away from the polls.”  Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4-5 (2006).  \n12 \nFor these reasons, the Supreme Court has counseled caution in the type of relief to be granted in cases \n13 \naffecting elections: \n14 \nIn awarding or withholding immediate relief, a court is entitled to and should consider the \n15  proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of state election laws, \nand should act and rely upon general equitable principles.  With respect to the timing of relief, \n16  a court can reasonably endeavor to avoid a disruption of the election process which might \nresult from requiring precipitate changes that could make unreasonable or embarrassing \n17  demands on a State in adjusting to the requirements of the court’s decree. \n18  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 585 (1964). \n19  These principles strongly counsel against an injunction in this case.  All of the remedies sought \n20  by Plaintiffs are unnecessary and some of them are impossible.  One impossible remedy is to extend \n21  the voter registration deadline to Election Day.  As described in Director Arntz’s declaration, this \n22  remedy would likely be fatal to the Department’s ability to conduct the election.  Arntz Dec., ¶ 43.  \n23  There are currently about 397,000 San Franciscans who have not registered to vote and millions more \n24  people throughout the state who have not registered.  See id.  Ordering Election Day registration \n25  would be tantamount to requiring the Department to allow every single person who showed up at a \n26  polling place on Election Day to cast a ballot.  See id.  If this happened, the election would be plunged \n27  into chaos, as the Department has not prepared for such vast numbers of people, nor could the \n28  Department prepare for such numbers in such a short time.  See id.   \nOpp. of S.F. Dept. of Elections to Mot. for Prelim. Inj.  24 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01110025.docx\nCase No. 16-CV-2739-WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 33   Filed 05/31/16   Page 30 of 30\n \n1  Planning for and running an election is an incredibly complex process that requires the \n2  Department to make a series of projections related to possible voter turnout.  See id. ¶ 44.  These \n3  projections inform the number of polling places; the number of ballots, provisional ballots, and ballot \n4  envelopes to order; the number of poll workers; the number of field support personnel; and countless \n5  other operational requirements.  See id.  The projections also inform the how the Department staffs \n6  and organizes the Voting Center at City Hall.  See id.  These projections are based on the registration \n7  totals from 15 days before an election.  See id.  The Department could not conduct the election if this \n8  Court ordered the Department to open the polls to 397,000 new San Francisco voters plus the millions \n9  of non-San Francisco voters who could attempt to vote in San Francisco on Election Day.  See id.     \n10  The other remedies sought by Plaintiffs are unnecessary because the Department is already \n11  doing them.  The Department will already inform NPP voters who vote at a polling place that they can \n12  vote in a presidential primary.  The Department’s online vote-by-mail application already satisfies the \n13  requirements of Elections Code § 3006(c), and in any event, the deadline to apply to vote by mail is \n14  the same day as the hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion.  The Department is already widely distributing \n15  information that NPP voters can vote in a presidential primary.  The Department has already widely \n16  distributed the fact that voters can change their party preference, and in any event, the deadline for re-\n17  registering was on May 23.  The Department has already ensured that sufficient ballots will be \n18  available at every polling place.   \n19   “[E]lection cases are different from ordinary injunction cases, and “[i]nterference with \n20  impending elections is extraordinary.”  Southwest Voter Registration Educ. Project v. Shelley, 344 \n21  F.3d 914, 919 (9th Cir. 2003).  There is no basis for such extraordinary intervention in this case. \nCONCLUSION \n22 \n23  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \n24  injunction.  \n25  Dated:  May 31, 2016 \nBy:  /s/Joshua S.

The motion was denied on the record at a hearing.  This memorandum\n24\nopinion sets forth the reasoning for denial of that motion.\n25\nSTATEMENT\n26\nThis action concerns the dissemination of information regarding voting procedures for\n27\nthe California presidential primary, which is scheduled to occur in six days on June 7, although\n28\nthe vote-by-mail procedure began on May 9.  Under California law, an individual who declines\nto disclose a preference for a political party when registering to vote (a “no-party-preference\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 2 of 7\n1 voter”), may nevertheless vote in a political party’s primary if that party has adopted a rule\n2 permitting so-called “crossover ballots.”  A crossover ballot is the only means by which a no-\n3 party-preference voter can vote for a presidential nominee in the upcoming primary.  The\n4 Democratic Party, the American Independent Party, and the Libertarian Party have elected to\n5 permit such crossover ballots.  (The Republican Party has not.)  Individuals affiliated with a\n6 party participating in a given primary cannot obtain a crossover ballot to vote in another party’s\n7 primary, although they could change their affiliation (including by changing to no party\n8 preference) by May 23.  Put in practical terms, Republicans could have re-registered as no-\n9 party-preference voters and then obtained a crossover ballot to vote in the Democratic primary,\n10 provided they changed their affiliation on or before May 23, now more than a week ago. \nt 11 Plaintiffs are supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders and expect their relief will support his\nr\nu\no a 12 campaign.  Senator Sanders, however, has no part in this lawsuit.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Defendants Alex Padilla, Secretary of State of California, John Arntz, chief of the San\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Francisco Department of Elections, and Tim Dupuis, chief of the Alameda County Registrar of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Voters, through their respective agencies, engaged in extensive efforts, including distributing\nS N 16 information by mail and via the internet, hosting outreach and education events, and buying\nted  For the  17 advertisements in print media and on public transportation, regarding the rights of no-party-\ni\nn\nU\n18 preference voters to obtain crossover ballots in order to vote in the three presidential primaries\n19 identified above.  Defendants also plan to display information about no-party-preference voters’\n20 rights prominently at poll stations (Dupuis Decl., Exhs. A, D–F; Arntz Decl., Exhs. A–B, D,\n21 F–I, K–T; Reyes Decl., Exhs. A–R).  Defendants have made similar efforts to inform voters that\n22 they could re-register to vote for a different party or to remove any party affiliation by May 23\n23 (e.g., Arntz Decl., Exh. B).\n24 Plaintiffs’ theory in this case is that certain information disseminated as part of the\n25 foregoing efforts has been inadequate or misleading.  They primarily take issue with the\n26 contention that the poll workers in Alameda County have been trained not to affirmatively\n27 inform no-party-preference voters of their rights to obtain a crossover ballot, while poll workers\n28 in San Francisco (and other counties) have been instructed to affirmatively inform no-party-\n2\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 3 of 7\n1 preference voters of that option.  They also note that no-party-preference voters received\n2 applications to vote by mail that set a deadline of April 18 for any request for a crossover ballot,\n3 and they received subsequent applications for replacement ballots (in case they later realized\n4 they wanted a crossover ballot) with a deadline to make that request by June 1.  Finally, they\n5 note that individuals that had indicated a party preference did not receive any information about\n6 what their rights regarding crossover ballots would be should they choose to change their\n7 registration.  \n8 The Court’s ruling on the record followed briefing and oral argument heard on an\n9 expedited schedule in order to allow more time for an emergency appeal before the primary. \n10 This memorandum opinion amplifies on that ruling.\nt 11 ANALYSIS\nr\nu\no a 12 A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must satisfy a four-part test established by\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the Supreme Court in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008). \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Specifically he must establish “that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of the equities tips\nS N 16 in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  Our plaintiffs fail at\nted  For the  17 every step.\ni\nn\nU\n18 1. PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS.\n19 A. Constitutional Claims.\n20 Plaintiffs contend that defendants’ conduct constituted arbitrary discrimination in\n21 violation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n22 Amendment, but they cite no authority suggesting this conduct is anything close to a\n23 constitutional violation.  In Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992), the Supreme Court\n24 held that in the context of election regulations, we must apply a “flexible standard” that weighs\n25 the burdens of the regulation against the government’s interest in enacting them.  If the burden\n26 is severe, the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, if not, it may be justified by important state\n27 interests.  \n28\n3\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 4 of 7\n1 Here, the burden on no-party-preference voters, is slight, if it exists at all.  Voters must\n2 read the materials provided to them to understand their rights; only some counties will spoon-\n3 feed the information.  The government’s interests in arranging for an orderly and fair primary,\n4 avoiding voter confusion by providing too much information, and ensuring that voters can\n5 receive their ballots in a timely manner all plainly justify defendants’ conduct.\n6 B. Voting Rights Act Claims.\n7 Plaintiffs also contend that defendants violated Sections 10101(a)(2)(A) and (B) of Title\n8 52 of the United States Code.  Section 10101(a)(2)(A) concerns voter registration, which is not\n9 at issue here.  Section 10101(a)(2)(B), on the other hand, prohibits a state from denying the\n10 right to vote “because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application,\nt 11 registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in\nr\nu\no a 12 determining whether such individual is qualified under State law to vote in such election.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs’ theory is that defendants have violated Section 10101(a)(2)(B) by omitting the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 statements regarding no-party-preference voters from materials distributed to voters that had\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 indicated a party preference, but there is no evidence of the possibility that anyone may be\nS N 16 denied the right to vote as a result of that omission.  Defendants have, in fact, extensively\nted  For the  17 campaigned to inform voters about their rights, so in the unlikely circumstance that a voter\ni\nn\nU\n18 timely removed her party affiliation but still sought to vote in a presidential primary via\n19 crossover ballot, ample information has been disseminated to inform her of that right.  \n20 Thus, plaintiffs have failed to show any likelihood of success on their Voting Rights Act\n21 claims.\n22 C. Claim for Mandamus.\n23 Plaintiffs do not assert independent claims based on violations of state law but rather\n24 seek a writ of mandamus under federal law compelling defendants to carry out certain alleged\n25 duties under state law.  Plaintiffs cite Section 1361 of Title 28 of the United States Code as the\n26 authority for that relief, but that provision only grants a district court authority to compel “an\n27 officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty . . . .” \n28 Defendants are all state and local officials, so Section 1361 does not apply.  Moreover, it is an\n4\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 5 of 7\n1 abuse of discretion for a district court to issue an injunction that requires state officials to do\n2 anything more than what is required by federal constitutional or statutory law.  See Trueblood v.\n3 Washington State Dept. of Soc. and Health Services, No. 15-35462, 2016 WL 2610233, at *7\n4 (9th Cir. May 6, 2016) (citing Katie A., ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cnty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1155\n5 (9th Cir. 2007)). \n6 Plaintiffs’ delay in bringing this motion has left too little time for any relief anyway,\n7 save and except for possibly relief at polling places.  Contrary to plaintiffs, however, state law\n8 does not require defendants to affirmatively inform no-party-preference voters of their rights to\n9 obtain a crossover ballot at the polling place.  Section 13102(b) of the California Elections Code\n10 provides, “[a]t partisan primary elections, each voter not registered disclosing a preference with\nt 11 any one of the political parties participating in an election shall be furnished only a nonpartisan\nr\nu\no a 12 ballot, unless he or she requests a ballot of a political party” that has authorized crossover\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 ballots.  Thus, the plain language of the statute contemplates that the voter would affirmatively\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 request the crossover ballot.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 As stated, the Court is without jurisdiction to issue an injunction against our defendants\nS N 16 based on a state law duty, but plaintiffs have not shown that they could succeed on the merits in\nted  For the  17 any case.\ni\nn\nU\n18 2. NO IRREPARABLE HARM.\n19 Plaintiffs’ theory of harm rests entirely on speculation.  They contend no-party-\n20 preference voters might be denied crossover ballots or might be unaware of their rights, and\n21 they are concerned that defendants will act contrary to the law although there is no factual basis\n22 for that concern.  Defendants have already undertaken significant efforts to inform voters,\n23 particularly no-party-preference voters, of their rights, and voters will have additional\n24 information in front of them at their respective polling places.  Far from establishing irreparable\n25 harm might occur, plaintiffs have failed to show that they would suffer any harm as a result of a\n26 denial of their motion.   \n27 3. BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES AND PUBLIC INTEREST.\n28 In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 585 (1964), the Supreme Court cautioned:\n5\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 6 of 7\n1 [U]nder certain circumstances, such as where an impending\nelection is imminent and a State’s election machinery is already in\n2 progress, equitable considerations might justify a court in\nwithholding the granting of immediately effective relief in a\n3 legislative apportionment case, even though the existing\napportionment scheme was found invalid.  In awarding or\n4 withholding immediate relief, a court is entitled to and should\nconsider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the\n5 mechanics and complexities of state election laws, and should act\nand rely upon general equitable principles.  With respect to the\n6 timing of relief, a court can reasonably endeavor to avoid a\ndisruption of the election process which might result from\n7 requiring precipitate changes that could make unreasonable or\nembarrassing demands on a State in adjusting to the requirements\n8 of the court’s decree.\n9 In S.W. Voter Registration Educ. Project v. Shelley, 344 F.3d 914, 919 (9th Cir. 2003), our\n10 court of appeals applied the same principle in the context of an injunction in a Voting Rights\nt 11 Act case (as here):\nr\nu\no a 12 In this case, hardship falls not only upon the putative defendant,\nC ni\n  or the California Secretary of State, but on all the citizens of\nct alif 13 California, because this case concerns a statewide election.  The\ni C\ntr of  public interest is significantly affected.  For this reason our law\n Dis District  14 rinecjuongcntiizoens  ctahsaet se. lSeeceti,o en. gc.a, sReesy anroel ddsif fve. rSeinmt sf,r o3m77 o Urd.Sin. aarty 585, 84\ntates orthern  15 Sex.Ctrta.o 1r3d6in2a. r yIn, tiedr.f, earnedn cien tweriftehr eimncpee nwdiitnhg a nel eecleticotinosn i safter voting\nS N 16 has begun is unprecedented.\nted  For the  17 Although plaintiffs became aware of many of the alleged irregularities and inaccuracies\ni\nn\nU\n18 herein at least as early as May 13, they did not file this motion until 7:00 p.m. on Friday, May\n19 27, just eleven days before the election.  Moreover, although the Court set a briefing and\n20 hearing schedule just three minutes after the motion was filed, plaintiffs’ delays ensured that the\n21 motion could not be heard and decided until June 1, less than a week before the primary. \n22 Plaintiffs’ proposed relief, to the extent it is feasible at all, would no doubt cause voter\n23 confusion by changing the rules in the middle of the primary and changing the messaging about\n24 voters’ rights.  Voters have already received clear enough instructions, submitted their vote-by-\n25 mail applications, and some votes have already been cast.  The extraordinary remedy that\n26 plaintiffs seek is not warranted.\n27 Plaintiffs’ contention that they could not file the complaint or this motion because they\n28 were developing their theory based on poll-worker training rings hollow.  Plaintiffs should have\n6\n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 46   Filed 06/02/16   Page 7 of 7\n1 been investigating that issue from the outset, and they should have sought relief as to the claims\n2 they already knew about immediately.  Moreover, plaintiffs delayed more than twenty-four\n3 hours between informing the deputy courtroom clerk that they would seek to be heard on a\n4 request to shorten time to hear this motion and actually filing this motion. \n5 CONCLUSION \n6 The reasons stated above required denial of plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\n7 injunction.\n8\n9 Dated:   June 2, 2016.                                                                \nWILLIAM ALSUP\n10 UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nt 11\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n7",

(Docket No. 46.)  Taking \n11  all of the allegations in the Amended Complaint as true, the lawsuit is moot, Plaintiffs lack standing, \n12  and every cause of action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  This motion to \n13  dismiss is based on this Notice Of Motion and Motion To Dismiss, the Memorandum of Points and \n14  Authorities, the Request for Judicial Notice (included on pages 10 and 15 of this document), the \n15  Declaration of John Arntz, and the Proposed Order, all filed or lodged herewith, as well as the file in \n16  this case, the argument of counsel at the hearing, and any such further matters as the Court deems \n17  appropriate. \n18   \n \n19 \n \n20     \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nS.F.

INTRODUCTION \n2 \n3  As the Court concluded three weeks ago in its Order denying Plaintiff’s motion for a \n4  preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs’ assertion that the San Francisco Department of Elections \n5  (“Department”) has violated their voting rights is entirely meritless.  Like Plaintiffs’ motion for \n6  preliminary injunction, the Complaint alleges that the Department has violated the Constitution, the \n7  Voting Rights Act, and California law by failing to inform voters who have not expressed a party \n8  preference (“No Party Preference” or “NPP” voters) that they can vote in the Democratic, Libertarian, \n9  or American Independent presidential primaries on the June 7, 2016 election, and by failing to inform \n10  voters who have expressed a party preference that they can change that preference.  On June 2, 2016, \n11  the Court rejected every single one of Plaintiffs’ legal theories.  (Docket No. 46 (“Order”).)  In the \n12  intervening three weeks, only one thing has changed:  in addition to failing to state a claim, the case is \n13  now moot because the election has already occurred and the alleged “injury” of the two registered San \n14  Francisco voter Plaintiffs has been resolved because they actually did vote in the Democratic Party \n15  primary. \nII.  THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION ON JUNE 7, 2016 \n16 \n17  Each political party has the option of allowing NPP voters to vote in its presidential primary.  \n18  For the June 7 election, three political parties chose to do so: the Democratic Party, the American \n19  Independent Party, and the Libertarian Party.  Compl. ¶ 3.1  An NPP voter who votes in one of these \n20  primaries does so using what is sometimes called a “crossover ballot.”  See id. \n21  A voter who wishes to vote by mail must apply to do so.  See Cal. Elections Code § 3001.  A \n22  voter may apply to receive a vote-by-mail ballot at every election or may apply to receive such a ballot \n23  only for a specific election.  See id. §§ 3201; 3006(a)(4).  If a county elections official chooses to mail \n24  a vote-by-mail application to registered voters, that application must contain certain information, such \n25  as the date by which the application is due, space for the voter’s name, address, and signature, as well \n26  as the name and date for which the request to vote by mail is made.  See id., § 3006(a); see also id. § \n27 \n                                                 \n28  1 All references to the Complaint are to the operative Amended Complaint. \nS.F.

If a county elections official sends a vote-by-mail application to NPP voters, that \n2  application must inform the voters that they can vote in a presidential primary for any party that has \n3  opened its primary to NPP voters.  See id. § 3006(c).  That application must also include the following \n4  statement: “I have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party. However, for this \n5  primary election only, I request a vote by mail ballot for the _________ Party.”  Id.   \n6 \nIII.  THE DEPARTMENT’S VOTE-BY-MAIL APPLICATIONS AND VOTER \nINFORMATION PAMPHLET \n7 \n8  The Department conducts “all public federal, state, district and municipal elections in the City \n9  and County.”  S.F. Charter § 13.104.  The Complaint refers to and/or incorporates by reference the \n10  Department’s online vote-by-mail application and the Department’s Voter Information Pamphlet.2  \n11  Compl., ¶¶ 8-11.  Each is discussed below.   \n12  The Department’s website offers voters the option to register to vote by mail.  See Declaration \n13  of John Arntz (“Arntz Dec.”) ¶ 2.  The first step in the online application process requires the voter to \n14  enter his or her house number, zip code, and date of birth.  See id. ¶ 2; Ex. A.  From this information, \n15  the Department can determine if the person is an NPP voter.  See id.  If so, the application \n16  automatically informs the voter that he or she has the option of voting in one of the presidential \n17  primaries, and that to do so, the voter must fill out a separate application.  See id. ¶ 2; Ex. B.  The page \n18  contains a link to that application.  See id. ¶ 2; Ex. C.   \n19  The Department provides a Voter Information Pamphlet (“VIP”) to every registered San \n20  Francisco voter.  See id. ¶ 3.  The back cover of every VIP contains a vote-by-mail application, and for \n21  NPP voters, that application includes the option to select a party preference: \n22  According to our records, you did not indicate a preference for a qualified \npolitical party when you registered to vote.  For this election, the following \n23  political parties will allow voters with no party preference to vote in their \nprimary election for President of the United States: American Independent, \n24  Democratic, Libertarian. \n25                                                   \n2 The Court may consider these documents when ruling on the instant motion to dismiss.  \n26  “When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the district court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint, \ndocuments attached to the complaint, documents relied upon but not attached to the complaint when \n27  authenticity is not contested, and matters of which the Court takes judicial notice.”  In re Northpoint \nCommunications Group, Inc., Securities Litigation, 221 F.Supp.2d 1090, 1094 (N.D. Cal., May 28, \n28  2002)  (citing Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 705–06 (9th Cir. 1998)).  \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  3 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.  C16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 51   Filed 06/20/16   Page 10 of 21\n \nNote: If you do not request the ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not \n1  include a contest for President. \nI have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party.  However, \n2 \nfor this primary election only, I request a vote-by-mail ballot of the ______ \nparty (choose one): \n3 \n___American Independent     ___Democratic        ___Libertarian \n4 \nFor more information, call 1-800-345-VOTE, or visit sos.ca.gov.  \n5 \nSee id. ¶ 3; Ex. D.  The back cover of VIPs mailed to non-NPP voters does not include this language.  \n6 \nSee id. ¶ 3; Ex. E.  \n7 \nInside the VIP are answers to questions such as “What does party preference mean?”; “How \n8 \ncan I find out my party preference?”; “How can I change my party preference?” and “I did not disclose \n9 \na party preference when I registered to vote.  What ballot will I receive?”  See id. ¶ 3; Ex. D at 12-13.  \n10 \nThe answer provided to the latter question is:  \n11 \nAll voters, regardless of party preference, can vote in contests for voter-\n12  nominated offices, nonpartisan offices, and ballot measures. For the June 7 \nelection, three parties will allow voters with no party preference to participate in \n13  their presidential primary elections: the American Independent Party, the \nDemocratic Party, and the Libertarian Party. You can request to vote in one of \n14  these party primaries, or you will receive a ballot with no presidential contest. \nIf you vote by mail: you may request a party ballot by indicating your choice on \n15 \nthe Vote-by-Mail Application on the back cover of this pamphlet. The \nDepartment of Elections must receive this application no later than  5 p.m. on \n16 \nMay 31. \n17  If you vote in person: you may request the ballot of your choice from a poll \nworker when you sign the roster. \n18 \n19  See id.  The VIP also provides an easy-to-understand flow chart explaining that NPP voters may vote \n20  in any of the three designated presidential primaries, whereas voters registered for a political party \n21  may only vote in the party’s presidential primary.  See id. ¶ 3, Ex. D at 13.  In addition, a letter from \n22  Director Arntz at the front of the VIP explains that “the party preference that voters selected when \n23  registering to vote determines which candidates will appear on their ballots for these contests,” but that \n24  three parties have allowed NPP voters to vote in their primaries.  See id., Ex. D at 4.3 \n25                                                   \n3 Though not at issue in this motion to dismiss, the Department made extensive additional \n26  efforts, including a comprehensive outreach campaign and letters to every San Francisco household, to \ninform NPP voters of their rights to request crossover ballots and to inform party preference voters of \n27  their rights to change party registration.  (See Docket No. 35 (“Declaration of San Francisco Director \nof Elections John Arntz in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction”).)  In their \n28  arguments in favor of a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs made no effort to dispute any of these facts. \nS.F.

THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT \n1 \nA.  The Plaintiffs \n2 \nPlaintiffs consist of “an unincorporated association based in Oakland, California” called the \n3 \nVoting Rights Defense Project, the American Independent party, and two registered San Francisco \n4 \nvoters—Suzanne Bushnell and Clara Daims.  Compl., ¶¶ 13-16.  With regard to Ms. Bushnell, the \n5 \nComplaint alleges she has been injured  \n6 \ndue to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the mandatory notice \n7  provisions set forth above. She has “informational standing” due to these \nomissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled to relief designed to restore her \n8  to the situation she would have been in if this information was not denied to her. \nShe is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a Presidential party ballot for \n9  Bernie Sanders if she becomes a no party preference voter.  \n10 \nSee id. ¶ 18.  Similarly, with regard to Ms. Daims, the Complaint alleges: \n11  As a no party preference voter in San Francisco and the state of California, she \nhas been injured due to the failure of the Defendants to comply with the \n12  mandatory notice provisions set forth above. She has “informational standing” \ndue to these omissions by the Defendants, and she is entitled to relief designed \n13  to restore her to the situation she would have been in if this information was not \ndenied to her. She is uncertain whether she will be able to obtain a Presidential \n14  party ballot for Bernie Sanders if she remains a no party preference voter.  \n15 \nSee id. ¶ 19.   \n16  B.  The Causes of Action \n1.  First Cause of Action: Voting Rights Act—52 U.S.C. § 10101(A) \n17 \n18  Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants, acting under color of state law, applied different standards, \n19  practices, or procedures in determining whether party voters would be given voter informational rights \n20  than were applied to no party preference voters.”  See id. ¶ 23.  The Complaint does little to elucidate \n21  the “standards, practices, or procedures” to which the latter phrase is referring.  Plaintiffs seem to be \n22  relying on Defendants’ alleged “failure to inform NPP voters . . . of their right to obtain a ‘crossover \n23  ballot’ and to vote in the Presidential primary” and “the failure to inform party-affiliated voters of their \n24  right to re-register as no party preference voters and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the \n25  Democratic, American Independent, and Libertarian parties.”  See id. ¶ 3.  The Complaint also refers \n26  generally to Defendants’ alleged practice of treating “voters in a county” different from “other voters \n27  in the county.”  See id. ¶ 6.   \n28 \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  5 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.  C16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 51   Filed 06/20/16   Page 12 of 21\n \n2.  Second Cause of Action: Voting Rights Act—52 U.S.C. § 10101(B) \n1 \n2  According to the Complaint, “[c]ertain Plaintiffs – or the individuals that they represent – are \n3  in imminent danger of being denied the right to vote in the Presidential primary election because of the \n4  errors and omissions contained in the mandatory notices containing crucial information necessary in \n5  order to obtain the ballot.  These errors or omissions are not material in determining whether these \n6  individuals are qualified under State law to vote in the June 2016 Presidential primary election.”  See \n7  id. ¶ 27.  There are two alleged “errors or omissions” identified in the Complaint.  See id. ¶¶ 8-11. \n8  The first is on the Department’s online vote-by-mail application, which, according to the \n9  Complaint, does not provide to all voters the statement in Elections Code Section 3006(c)—“I have \n10  declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party.”  In other words, Plaintiffs allege that \n11  the Department violated the Voting Rights Act by failing to tell voters who have disclosed a \n12  preference for a qualified political party that that they “have declined to disclose a preference for a \n13  qualified political party.”  Compl. ¶ 8.  The second alleged omission is similar to the first.  The \n14  Complaint alleges that the back cover of the VIP should have informed all voters, including those who \n15  have disclosed a preference for a qualified political party that that they “have declined to disclose a \n16  preference for a qualified political party.”  See id. ¶ 9. \n3.  Third Cause of Action: First and Fourteenth Amendments \n17 \n18  Plaintiffs allege that the Department violated the Constitution by arbitrarily discriminating \n19  between NPP and non-NPP voters.  See id. ¶ 29.  This alleged discrimination appears to consist of \n20  allegedly not informing NPP voters that they can obtain a crossover ballot and allegedly not informing \n21  party preference voters that they can change party preference.  See id. ¶ 3-5, 9-10. \n4.  Fourth Cause of Action: Writ of Mandamus under 28 U.S.C. § 1361 \n22 \n23    Plaintiffs seek “mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1361” for violations of state law.  Compl. ¶¶ \n24  33-34.  The state laws listed in the Complaint are Elections Code § 3006(c) (requiring mailers to NPP \n25  voters who have registered to vote by mail include a crossover ballot request form); Elections Code § \n26  3007.7(e) (requiring online vote-by-mail applications to inform NPP voters that they can request a \n27  crossover ballot); and Elections Code § 3006(b)(3) (requiring that vote-by-mail application forms tell \n28  voters that they can hand deliver the application to the county elections official).

Eight of those remedies (Prayers 2-9) seek court \n3  orders to prevent certain harms from occurring at the June 7 election.  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek \n4  orders requiring the Department to: provide certain information to voters (Prayer 2); have enough \n5  ballots (Prayer 3); allow NPP voters to obtain a crossover ballot when voting at a polling (Prayer 4); \n6  change its website so voters know they can obtain crossover ballots (Prayer 5); allow NPP voters to \n7  write-in the names of presidential primary candidates (Prayer 6); extend the voter registration deadline \n8  to allow voters to change party preference (Prayer 7); inform party preference voters that they can \n9  switch to NPP (Prayer 8); and issue provisional ballots only if there is no other option (Prayer 9).  The \n10  other three remedies sought are declaratory relief (Prayer 1); fees (Prayer 10); and costs (Prayer 11). \nV.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n11 \n12  Plaintiffs filed their complaint on May 20, 2016, and amended it the same day.  (Docket No. 1; \n13  2.)  Plaintiffs then waited a week to file their motion for preliminary injunction.  (Docket Nos. 12-14, \n14  16-17.)  The Department first appeared in this action on May 31, 2016, opposing Plaintiffs’ \n15  preliminary injunction motion.  (Docket No. 32.)  On June 1, 2016, the Court held a hearing on \n16  Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, and denied that motion from the bench.  (Docket No. 47.)  \n17  The next day, the Court issued an Order setting forth its reasoning for denying the motion.  (Docket \n18  No. 46.)  Despite multiple requests from defense counsel, Plaintiffs have refused to dismiss their \n19  lawsuit.   \nVI.  LEGAL STANDARD \n20 \n21  A court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil \n22  Procedure 12(b)(6) when “it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be \n23  proven consistent with the allegations.”  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984).  \n24  Dismissal is also proper where the complaint alleges facts that demonstrate that the complaint is barred \n25  as a matter of law.  See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990); Jablon \n26  v. Dean Witter & Co., 614 F.2d 677, 682 (9th Cir. 1980).  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \n27  must state a claim that is facially plausible, that is, “‘the non-conclusory factual content,’ and \n28 \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  7 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.

U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009).   \n3  VII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Lawsuit Is Moot Because the Election Has Already Occurred.4 \n4 \n5  “It is the inexorable command of the United States Constitution that the federal courts confine \n6  themselves to actual cases and controversies. See U.S. CONST. art III, § 2, cl. 1.”  Gator.com Corp. v. \n7  L.L. Bean, Inc., 398 F.3d 1125, 1128 (9th Cir. 2005).  Article III requires that an actual controversy \n8  exist at all phases of the litigation. Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8 v. Brown, 752 F.3d 827, 834 (9th \n9  Cir. 2014); Gator.com, 398 F.3d at 1128.  Thus, moot claims are not justiciable.  The court “loses its \n10  power to render a decision on the merits of a claim [citation], when [it] can no longer effectively \n11  remedy a ‘present controversy’ between the parties.”  Protectmarriage.com, 752 F.3d at 834.   \n12  Plaintiffs’ claims are now moot because the primary election was concluded June 7.  All of \n13  Plaintiffs’ allegations are based on events relating to that election.  Compl. ¶¶ 4-5, 7-14, 16, 18-19.  \n14  Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and the relief they seek are specific to the election.  There is no justiciable \n15  controversy because the Court is “unable to effectively remedy a present controversy between the \n16  parties where a plaintiff seeks to enjoin an activity that has already occurred, and [the court] cannot \n17  ‘undo’ that action’s allegedly harmful effects.”  Protectmarriage.com, 752 F.3d at 834. \n18 \nB.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing Because Their Injuries Have Always Been Speculative, \nand In Any Event, the Action Is Moot Because Both Plaintiffs Who Have Any \n19 \nAlleged Connection to San Francisco Voted in the Democratic Presidential \nPrimary. \n20 \n21  Article III requires a plaintiff in federal court to have standing.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n22  504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (describing standing as “an irreducible constitutional minimum”).  To \n23  establish standing, Plaintiffs must show that: (1) they suffered an injury in fact – an invasion of a \n24  legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not \n25  conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct \n26  complained of; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed \n27                                                   \n4 The two paragraphs in this section are largely identical to those in the Secretary of State’s \n28  motion to dismiss, Docket No. 48 at 6. \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  8 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.  C16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 51   Filed 06/20/16   Page 15 of 21\n \n1  by a favorable decision.  Id. at 560-61 (citations and quotations marks omitted).  Where an allegation \n2  of injury is conjectural or hypothetical and not clean-cut and concrete, concepts of standing and \n3  ripeness overlap and provide additional ground for dismissing a complaint.  Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 \n4  F.3d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).   \n5  Here, the two plaintiffs alleged to have any connection to San Francisco are Suzanne Bushnell \n6  and Clara Daims.  The Complaint alleges that Ms. Bushnell, who is a Democrat, was “uncertain” \n7  whether she would be able to obtain a Democratic ballot if she became an NPP voter.  Compl. ¶ 18.  \n8  Not only is this “injury” pure speculation, it is also absurd—if Ms. Bushnell wanted to vote in the \n9  Democatic primary, she could have simply remained a Democrat, received her ballot, and voted.  \n10  Equally speculative is the “injury” of Ms. Daims, an NPP voter who was “uncertain” whether she \n11  would be able to vote in the Democratic primary.  Compl. ¶ 19.  But this is not a concrete injury either:  \n12  if Ms. Daims wished to determine whether she could vote in the Democratic primary, all she had to do \n13  was inform the Department of Elections that she wanted to vote in the Democratic primary.  Indeed, as \n14  discussed in the next paragraph and footnote 5, she did just that. \n15  These “injuries” are so speculative and baseless that they never satisfied Article III standing \n16  requirements.  And even if they ever met that standard, they no longer do.  Ms. Daims and Ms. \n17  Bushnell both voted in the Democratic primary, Arntz Dec. ¶ 5,5 and as such, their claims are moot.  \n18  See Protectmarriage.com-Yes on 8, 752 F.3d at 834.6  \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n5 The Department requests that the Court take judicial notice of the fact that Ms. Daims and \n21 \nMs. Bushnell voted in the Democratic presidential primary at the June 7, 2016 election.  Courts may \ntake judicial notice of facts as part of a motion to dismiss.  See In re Northpoint Communications \n22 \nGroup, Inc., Securities Litigation, 221 F.Supp.2d at 1094.  “A judicially noticed fact must be one not \nsubject to reasonable dispute in that it is . . . capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to \n23 \nsources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  As described in \nDirector Arntz’s declaration, the Department maintains a registration database, which includes each \n24 \nvoter’s voting history.  Arntz Dec. ¶ 4.  Director Arntz checked that database on June 16, 2016 and \nobserved that both Ms. Daims and Ms. Bushnell cast votes in the Democratic presidential primary for \n25 \nthe June 7, 2016 election.  See id.   \n26  6 The Complaint does not allege that the other two Defendants—the Voting Rights Defense \nProject and the American Independent Party—suffered any injury.  Even if the Complaint did allege \n27  that those Defendants were “injured” by the alleged confusion of NPP voters as to which primary they \ncould vote in, those alleged injuries would be just as speculative as those alleged by Ms. Daims and \n28  Ms. Bushnell. \nS.F.

The Causes of Action Fail to State a Claim. \n1 \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Voting Rights Act Claim Under Section 10101(a)(2)(A) Fails \nBecause Voter Registration Is Not At Issue in This Case. \n2 \n3  Plaintiffs allege that the Department violated 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(A), which states: \nNo person acting under color of law shall in determining whether any individual \n4 \nis qualified under State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, \npractice, or procedure different from the standards, practices, or procedures \n5 \napplied under such law or laws to other individuals within the same county, \nparish, or similar political subdivision who have been found by State officials to \n6 \nbe qualified to vote. . . . \n7 \nThat provision “was designed to eliminate practices that could encumber an individual’s ability \n8 \nto register to vote.”  Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F.Supp.2d 1356, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (citing Schwier v. \n9 \nCox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2003).  As this Court has already held: “Section 10101(a)(2)(A) \n10 \nconcerns voter registration, which is not at issue here.”  Order at 4.   \n11 \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Voting Rights Act Claim Under Section 10101(a)(2)(B) Fails \nBecause The Complaint Fails to Allege a Legally Cognizable Error or \n12 \nOmission on Any Writing Requisite to Voting. \n13 \nPlaintiffs’ claim under Subsection (B)—sometimes referred to as the Voting Rights Act’s \n14 \n“materiality provision”—is equally meritless.  Originally enacted as part of the Civil Rights Act of \n15 \n1964, Subsection (B) was a piece of the federal government’s effort to enforce voting rights and \n16 \n“counteract state and local government tactics of using, among other things, burdensome registration \n17 \nrequirements to disenfranchise African-Americans.”  Florida State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. \n18 \nBrowning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1173 (11th Cir. 2008).   Subsection (B) states: \n19  No person acting under color of law may deny the right of any individual to \nvote in any election because of an error or omission on any record or paper \n20  relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting, if such \nerror or omission is not material in determining whether such individual is \n21  qualified under State law to vote in such election. \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ Section (B) claim fails because there has been no “error or omission.”  The alleged \n23 \nomission described in the Complaint is the Department’s failure to tell voters who have disclosed a \n24 \npreference for a qualified political party that that they have not “disclose[d] a preference for a \n25 \nqualified political party.”  This does not constitute a legally cognizable error or omission within the \n26 \nmeaning of the Voting Rights Act because registrars have no legal obligation to make this disclosure, \n27 \nand indeed, doing so would confuse voters.  In addition, the alleged error or omission does not occur \n28 \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  10 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.  C16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 51   Filed 06/20/16   Page 17 of 21\n \n1  on an “application, registration, or other act requisite to voting.”  This is because people requesting \n2  crossover ballots have already registered to vote.  As the Secretary of State argues in support of his \n3  motion to dismiss, there is no allegation that the Department rejected any application to register to vote \n4  or attempt to vote.  (Docket No. 48 at 11.) \n5  The Complaint appears to allege that the Department erred within the meaning of Subsection \n6  (B) by failing to tell party preference voters that they can re-register as NPP voters.  Compl. ¶ 3.  Not \n7  only is this supposed error nonsensical—if a party preference voter didn’t want to vote in the party’s \n8  primary, they could simply choose not to vote in that primary—but Plaintiffs lack standing to assert \n9  this error since they both allege that they wanted to vote in the Democratic primary.  Compl. ¶¶ 18-19. \n3.  Plaintiffs’ First and Fourteenth Amendment Claim Fails Because The \n10 \nDepartment Has Not Burdened Voting Rights. \n11 \nThe Complaint alleges that the Department violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth \n12 \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  To assess the constitutionality of election laws, courts apply a \n13 \n“flexible standard” that weighs the burdens of such regulation against the government’s interests in \n14 \nenacting those laws.  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).  Focusing on “the extent to which \n15 \na challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendments rights,” the Court has applied the \n16 \nfollowing test:   \n17 \n . . . when those rights are subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be \nnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.  But when \n18 \na state election law provision imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory \nrestrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, the \n19 \nState’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the \nrestrictions. \n20 \n21  Id. at 434 (quotations and citations omitted).  If the burden is severe, the regulation is subject to strict \n22  scrutiny; if the challenged regulation is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, it may be justified by \n23  important regulatory interests.  The Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have consistently applied this \n24  balancing approach in considering First Amendment, Due Process, and Equal Protection challenges to \n25  election laws.  See Dudum v. Arntz, 640 F.3d 1098, 1106 n.15 (9th Cir. 2011); Lemons v. Bradbury, \n26  538 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir. 2008).  Courts have occasionally described the test for reasonable, \n27  nondiscriminatory regulations as a “rational basis” test, Libertarian Party of Washington v. Munro, 31 \n28  F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir. 1994), under which a plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged regulation \nS.F.

Reagan, 798 F.3d \n2  723, 733-34 (9th Cir. 2015).   \n3  Applying this standard, the courts have upheld a myriad of election regulations as reasonable \n4  and non-discriminatory, even where there is a significant possibility that they would burden voters.  \n5  See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181, 185, 202-03 (2008) (plurality \n6  opinion) (voter identification); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 760-62 (1973) (advance \n7  enrollment requirement for party primary elections); Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686, 686-87 (1973) \n8  (requirement that voters register at least 50 days prior to election); Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679, \n9  680-81 (1973) (requirement that voters reside in jurisdiction for 50 days prior to registration); see also \n10  Ayers-Schaffner v. DiStefano, 37 F.3d 726, 729 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994) (“It is, of course, well established \n11  that states may restrict the voting privilege through residency and other requirements.”).   \n12  Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims fail for the reasons already articulated by the Court: “Here, the \n13  burden on no-party-preference voters, is slight, if it exists at all.  Voters must read the materials \n14  provided to them to understand their rights; only some counties will spoonfeed the information.  The \n15  government’s interests in arranging for an orderly and fair primary, avoiding voter confusion by \n16  providing too much information, and ensuring that voters can receive their ballots in a timely manner \n17  all plainly justify defendants’ conduct.”  Order at 4.   \n18  This ruling is equally applicable in the context of a motion to dismiss.  The Complaint \n19  incorporates by reference the Voter Information Pamphlet which, among other things, clearly explains \n20  all of the relevant issues in this case, including informing NPP voters that they can obtain a crossover \n21  ballot for one of three primaries and informing party preference voters of their right to change their \n22  party preference.  As a matter of law, there was no burden on NPP voters or any other voters.  The \n23  Department’s decision to provide this information to voters—and to not provide the additional, \n24  irrelevant information that Plaintiffs demand—was motivated by the legitimate goal of avoiding voter \n25  confusion.  Similarly, the Department’s online vote-by-mail application did not burden voting rights \n26  and was justified by a reasonable governmental interest.  The Department appropriately declined to tell \n27  party preference voters that they had not disclosed a party preference.  This decision avoided \n28  confusion and, far from burdening voting rights, helped realize them. \nS.F. Dept. of Elections’ Mot. to Dismiss  12 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01114811.docx\nCASE NO.  C16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 51   Filed 06/20/16   Page 19 of 21\n \n1    At a more general level, there are no cases of which the Department is aware holding that an \n2  elections official violates the First or Fourteenth Amendments by failing to provide all voters with \n3  identical information.  In support of their preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiffs relied exclusively \n4  on one case—Griffin v. Burns, 431 F.Supp. 1361, 1363 (Dist. of R.I., May 17, 1977)—but that case is \n5  not even remotely apposite.  There, the plaintiffs were absentee voters whose ballots had been rejected \n6  following a ruling by the Rhode Island Supreme Court that “there is no constitutional or statutory basis \n7  for allowing absentee and shut-in voters to cast their votes in a primary election.”  Id. (quoting \n8  McCormick v. State Board of Elections, 374 A.2d 116 (R.I. 1977)).  The district court held that \n9  categorically rejecting absentee ballots while accepting ballots cast at the polling place violated the \n10  Equal Protection Clause.  Id.  This case is nothing like Griffin.  The Department has complied fully \n11  with the law, has appropriately informed voters of their rights, and has not categorically rejected vote-\n12  by-mail ballots.   \n4.  Plaintiffs’ Request for a Writ of Mandamus Fails for Multiple Reasons. \n13 \n14  The Court has already ruled that Plaintiffs’ claim for a writ of mandamus is meritless, and the \n15  Court’s reasoning is equally applicable here:  “Plaintiffs do not assert independent claims based on \n16  violations of state law but rather seek a writ of mandamus under federal law compelling defendants to \n17  carry out certain alleged duties under state law.  Plaintiffs cite Section 1361 of Title 28 of the United \n18  States Code as the authority for that relief, but that provision only grants a district court authority to \n19  compel ‘an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty . . . .’  \n20  Defendants are all state and local officials, so Section 1361 does not apply.”  Order at 4.   \n21  The Court’s ruling is consisent with applicable caselaw.  “[F]ederal district courts are without \n22  power to issue mandamus to direct state courts, state judicial officers, or other state officials in the \n23  performance of their duties.  A petition for a writ of mandamus to compel a state court or official to \n24  take or refrain from some action is frivolous as a matter of law.”  Todd v. McElhany, No. CIV S-11-\n25  2346 LKK, 2011 WL 5526464, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2011) (citing, inter alia, Demos v. U.S. \n26  District Court, 925 F.2d 1160, 1161 (9th Cir. 1991), and Clark v.

Hawaii, Dec. 24, 2012) (“28 \n2  U.S.C. § 1361 provides district courts with jurisdiction in the nature of mandamus to compel officers \n3  or employees of the United States—not state agencies or actors like those named as Defendants in this \n4  action—to perform a duty owed to a plaintiff.”); Newton v. Poindexter, 578 F.Supp. 277, 279 (E.D. \n5  Cal., Jan. 18, 1984) (holding that federal courts cannot compel action by state officials under 28 \n6  U.S.C. § 1361).  \n7  There is an additional reason that Plaintiffs’ claim under Section 1361 fails.  As this Court held \n8  in its Order denying Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction: “[I]t is an abuse of discretion for a \n9  district court to issue an injunction that requires state officials to do anything more than what is \n10  required by federal constitutional or statutory law.  See Trueblood v. Washington State Dept. of Soc. \n11  and Health Services, No. 15-35462, 2016 WL 2610233, at *7 (9th Cir. May 6, 2016) (citing Katie A., \n12  ex rel. Ludin v. Los Angeles Cnty., 481 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2007)).”  Order at 4-5.  That \n13  authority is equally applicable in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. \n14  Even if the Court could reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ state law claims, they are meritless.  \n15  First, according to Plaintiffs, the Department’s online vote-by-mail application feature violates \n16  Elections Code Sections 3006(c) and 3007.7(e) by failing to tell party preference voters that they have \n17  not disclosed a party preference (despite the fact that they have, in fact, disclosed a party preference). \n18  Plaintiffs’ argument ignores the fact that the Department’s online vote-by-mail application feature is \n19  two-step process, and though the first page does not include the language from Section 3006(c), the \n20  second page does.  As described above, once a voter inputs his or her house number, zip code, and \n21  date of birth, the website determines whether that person is an NPP voter.  Arntz Dec. ¶ 2, Ex. A.  If \n22  so, the next page provides the voter with the information required by Section 3006(c) and includes a \n23  link to a vote-by-mail application that includes the language required by Section 3006(c).  See id. ¶ 2, \n24  Ex. B-C.   \n25  Second, the Complaint alleges that the Department violated Elections Code Section 3006 \n26  because the back cover of the VIP sent to NPP voters contains the Section 3006(c) language but the \n27  back cover of the VIP sent to party preference voters does not.  But again, it is not reasonable to \n28  construe Section 3006(c) to mean that voters who have disclosed a preference for a qualified political \nS.F.

But \nwhen an NPP voter fills out an application to vote by mail on the Department’s website, the website \n5 \nstates: “You may mail, deliver or fax the form to the address or fax number listed on the application.”  \n6 \nArntz Dec., Ex. B (emphasis added).  In addition, the application itself states, “Deliver, mail, or fax the \n7 \ncompleted application to the address or fax number listed below.”  See id., Ex. C.7  (emphasis added).  \n8 \nThat documents can be hand delivered to the Department is also included throughout the VIP.  See id., \n9 \nEx. D. \n10 \nFinally, to the extent Plaintiffs claim that the Department violated state law by not offering \n11 \ncrossover ballots to NPP voters, this claim fails because, as the Court has already ruled: “Contrary to \n12 \nplaintiffs, however, state law does not require defendants to affirmatively inform no-party-preference \n13 \nvoters of their rights to obtain a crossover ballot at the polling place.  Section 13102(b) of the \n14 \nCalifornia Elections Code provides, ‘[a]t partisan primary elections, each voter not registered \n15 \ndisclosing a preference with any one of the political parties participating in an election shall be \n16 \nfurnished only a nonpartisan ballot, unless he or she requests a ballot of a political party’ that has \n17 \nauthorized crossover ballots.  Thus, the plain language of the statute contemplates that the voter would \n18 \naffirmatively request the crossover ballot.”  Order at 5. \n19  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the motion to dismiss without leave to \n20 \namend, as the flaws described above are fatal and cannot be cured through amendment. \n21 \nDated:  June 20, 2016       By:  /s/Joshua S.

I am San Francisco’s Director of Elections, and I am a named defendant in this action.  \n3  I have personal knowledge of the following facts, except those stated on information and belief.  As to \n4  those facts, I believe them to be true.  If called upon to testify, I could and would testify competently \n5  to the contents of this Declaration. \n6  2.  I am the head of San Francisco’s Department of Elections (“Department”).  The \n7  Department conducts all federal, state and local elections in San Francisco.  Serving nearly 467,000 \n8  registered voters, the Department must ensure that the City meets all applicable legal deadlines, that it \n9  has adequate staff and equipment to provide election services, that the recording and tabulation of \n10  votes is accurate and secure, and that voting equipment and polling places are usable and accessible to \n11  voters.  For the presidential primary election on June 7, 2016, the Department has hired approximately \n12  250 temporary employees, including more than 30 dedicated to voter services and outreach.  On \n13  Election Day, the Department will manage 576 polling places staffed by 2,500 volunteer poll workers.   \n14  3.  Federal, state and local law closely regulate and prescribe nearly every aspect of the \n15  Department’s operations to ensure that San Francisco’s elections are fair and functional.  In \n16  compliance with these laws, the Department must adhere to a strict schedule to complete essential \n17  tasks for each election, including: ordering ballot supplies; preparing and printing ballots; mailing \n18  overseas and other vote-by-mail (formerly known as absentee) ballots; printing and distributing \n19  information to the voters; training employees and poll workers; testing the accuracy of every voting \n20  machine that will be used in the election; counting and tabulating votes; and conducting a mandatory \n21  post-election hand count to verify election results.  \n22   \n23  The Presidential Primary Election on June 7, 2016 \n24  4.  When registering to vote in California, a person has the option of selecting a political \n25  party preference.  Voters who register to vote without stating a party preference are known as “No \n26  Party Preference” or NPP voters.  Each political party has the option of allowing NPP voters to vote in \n27  its presidential primary.  For California’s presidential primary election on June 7, 2016, three political \n28 \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  1 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 3 of 13\n \n1  parties have chosen to allow NPP voters to vote on their presidential primary ballot:  the Democratic \n2  Party, the American Independent Party, and the Libertarian Party. \n3  5.  To obtain a vote-by-mail ballot, a person must apply by filling out an application and \n4  transmitting it to the Department by the seventh day prior to the election.  Cal. Elections Code § 3001.  \n5  For the June 7 election, that deadline is May 31.   \n6   \n7  The Department Has Made Extensive Efforts to Inform NPP Voters That They May Vote in a \n8  Presidential Primary. \n9  6.  The Department has made extensive efforts to inform NPP voters—both those who \n10  have applied to vote by mail and those who will be voting in-person at a polling place—that they may \n11  vote in one of the three presidential primaries.     \n12  7.  First, the Department has sent a mailer to all NPP voters who have applied to vote by \n13  mail informing them that they may request a “cross-over ballot,” i.e., a ballot that allows them to vote \n14  in a presidential primary in the June election.  A true and correct copy of such a mailer is attached \n15  hereto as Exhibit A.  Each mailer includes an application that allows NPP voters to request a vote-by-\n16  mail ballot for one of the three political parties.  The Department processes all applications received \n17  even after the deadline indicated on the mailer.  \n18  8.  Second, the Department includes a detailed “Voting Instructions” guide with every \n19  vote-by-mail ballot sent to San Francisco voters.  A true and correct copy of a “Voting Instructions” \n20  guide is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  An NPP voter may then request a replacement ballot that \n21  includes a presidential primary ballot.  The guide includes a link to the Department’s website where \n22  the voter can request a replacement ballot.  A copy of the replacement ballot form is attached hereto as \n23  Exhibit C.   \n24  9.  Third, in early May 2016, the Department provided a Voter Information Pamphlet \n25  (“VIP”) to every registered San Francisco voter in either hard copy or digital format.  In addition, the \n26  Department mails VIPs to people who register to vote after the VIPs have been mailed.  The VIP is \n27 \n28 \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  2 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 4 of 13\n \n1  also available online, in multiple languages.1  Though the substance of the VIP is the same for all \n2  voters, the back cover varies depending on whether or not the voter has expressed a party preference.  \n3  All back covers contain a vote-by-mail application.  However, for NPP voters, the application includes \n4  the option to select a party preference.  A voter who submits this application will receive a crossover \n5  ballot for the presidential primary indicated on the application.  Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a true \n6  and correct copy of a VIP that an NPP voter would receive.  Attached hereto as Exhibit E is a true and \n7  correct copy of the back cover of a VIP that a non-NPP voter would receive.  The Department’s goal is \n8  to write the VIP at an eighth grade reading level.   \n9  10.  Fourth, the Department’s website offers voters an online tool to look up their voter \n10  registration status.2  An NPP voter who looks up his status will be informed that he is an NPP voter.  \n11  Attached hereto as Exhibit F is a screenshot of what that NPP voter who has not applied to vote by \n12  mail (i.e., will be voting in person at a polling place) would see.  If the NPP voter has applied to vote \n13  by mail, the voter is provided the same statement, but is also informed that to vote in one of the \n14  presidential primaries, he must request a crossover ballot for one of the three political parties that have \n15  opened their presidential primaries to NPP voters.  Attached hereto as Exhibit G is a screenshot of \n16  what such a voter would see. \n17  11.  Fifth, an NPP voter who signs up on the Department’s website to vote by mail will be \n18  provided with similar information.  The first step in the online application process is to enter the \n19  voter’s house number, zip code, and date of birth.  Attached hereto as Exhibit H is a screenshot of this \n20  initial page.3  From this information, the Department can determine if the person is an NPP voter.  If \n21  so, the voter is informed that he has the option of voting in one of the presidential primaries, and that \n22  to do so, he must fill out an application.  Attached hereto as Exhibit I is a screenshot of this page.  This \n23  page contains a link to that application.  A true and correct copy of that application is attached hereto \n24  as Exhibit J.   \n25 \n                                                 \n26  1 http://voterguide.sfelections.org/en (English); http://voterguide.sfelections.org/zh-hant \n(Chinese); http://voterguide.sfelections.org/fil (Filipino); http://voterguide.sfelections.org/es (Spanish). \n27 \n2 http://sfelections.org/tools/reglookup/ \n28  3 http://sfelections.org/tools/vbmapp/index.php \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  3 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 5 of 13\n \n1  12.  Sixth, the Department has trained all poll workers to inform NPP voters that they have \n2  the option of voting for one of the three designated parties.  A true and correct copy of the relevant \n3  excerpts of the poll worker training manual is attached hereto as Exhibit K.4  Pages 37-50 discuss the \n4  fact that NPP voters should be offered a presidential primary ballot for the three political parties that \n5  have opted to allow NPP voters to vote in their primary.  In addition, every polling place in San \n6  Francisco has a sign informing NPP voters that they may vote in one of these primaries.  A true and \n7  correct copy of such a sign is attached hereto as Exhibit L. \n8  13.  Seventh, the VIP, which, as noted above, is provided to every registered San Francisco \n9  voter and is available on the Department’s website, provides answers to questions such as “What does \n10  party preference mean?”; “How can I find out my party preference?”; “How can I change my party \n11  preference?” and “I did not disclose a party preference when I registered to vote.  What ballot will I \n12  receive?”  See Ex. D at 12-13.  The VIP also provides an easy-to-understand flow chart explaining that \n13  NPP voters may vote in any of the three designated presidential primaries, whereas voters registered \n14  for a political party may only vote in the party’s presidential primary.  See Ex. D at 13.  In addition, a \n15  letter I wrote that appears near the front of the VIP explains that “the party preference that voters \n16  selected when registering to vote determines which candidates will appear on their ballots for these \n17  contests,” but that three parties have allowed NPP voters to vote in their primaries.  See Ex. D at 4.   \n18  14.  Eighth, on April 5, 2016, the Department sent a mailer to every household in San \n19  Francisco—over 362,000 in all—reminding them to vote and stating: “To learn what’s on the ballot \n20  and why your political party preference makes a difference in the Presidential Primary, go to \n21  sfelections.org/June2016.”  A true and correct copy of such a mailer is attached hereto as Exhibit M.  \n22  The link on the mailer, among other things, informs NPP voters that they can vote in the presidential \n23  primary for any of the three designated parties.  A true and correct copy of the website referenced on \n24  the mailer is attached hereto as Exhibit N.5 \n25 \n                                                 \n4 https://sfgov.org/elections/ftp/uploadedfiles/elections/GetInvolved/NOV2015/PollWorker \n26 \nManual2015.pdf \n27  5 The mailer references the website www.sfelections.org/June2016, and when one inputs that \nURL into a browser, one is automatically routed here: http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/ \n28  Documents/Voting/2016/2016J_Flowchart_VotingPrimary.pdf \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  4 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 6 of 13\n \n1  15.  Ninth, the Department has issued five press releases advising that, “Voters who did not \n2  select a party preference when registering to vote, will receive a ballot that does not include a \n3  presidential contest unless they request a ballot of one of the parties allowing voters with no party \n4  preference to participate in their presidential primaries.”  True and correct copies of those press \n5  releases are attached hereto as Exhibit O.  Those press releases are also available online.6  The \n6  Department maintains a list of “interested persons”, which includes organizations, interested members \n7  of the public, and media representatives, who automatically receive press releases by email. \n8  16.  Tenth, the Department maintains an active social medial presence, regularly issuing \n9  tweets and Facebook updates informing NPP voters that they can vote in one of the primaries and \n10  explaining how to do so.  Attached hereto as Exhibit P are printouts of some of these social media \n11  posts.  All social media posts appear on both Twitter and Facebook.  Many of the posts provide links \n12  to the Department’s website further explaining this issue and providing tools for vote-by-mail voters to \n13  request a presidential primary ballot. \n14  17.  Eleventh, the Department maintains a voter outreach desk that is staffed by people who \n15  are knowledgeable about how to change party preference and how to request crossover ballots, among \n16  other issues.  Any person with questions can call the help desk number, which the Department \n17  publishes in numerous locations, or come into the Department and speak with voter outreach \n18  personnel.  See Ex. A-G, I, L-S, U.  Personnel can provide assistance in Cantonese, Mandarin, \n19  Filipino, Spanish, and, using an on-demand language service, the Department can also provide \n20  assistance in more than 200 additional languages. \n                                                 \n21 \n6 http://sfgov.org/elections/article/june-7-2016-consolidated-presidential-primary-election-\nrules-voting-under-california%E2%80%99s (issued March 9, 2016);   \n22 \nhttp://sfgov.org/elections/article/department-elections-reminds-voters-no-party-preference-\n23  about-their-ballot-options-june-7 (issued April 7, 2016) \nhttp://sfgov.org/elections/article/department-elections-reminds-voters-why-party-\n24 \npreference%E2%80%93or-lack-party-preference%E2%80%93matter (issued April 29, 2016) \n25  http://sfgov.org/elections/article/department-elections-reminds-voters-why-party-preference-\nmatters-june-7-election (issued May 18, 2016) \n26 \nhttp://sfgov.org/elections/article/tuesday-may-31-last-day-request-vote-mail-june-7-election-0 \n(issued May 31, 2016). \n27 \nSee also http://sfgov.org/elections/article/today-deadline-register-vote-june-7-election (issued \n28  on May 23, 2016 discussing how to register or re-register to vote) \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  5 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 7 of 13\n \n1  18.  Finally, the Department has conducted an extensive outreach campaign to educate \n2  voters about a host of issues, including the implications of being an NPP voter and how to obtain a \n3  crossover ballot.  In all, the Department has provided informational materials to over 700 civic \n4  partners through a variety of means.  For example, Department representatives distribute materials at \n5  events, fairs, and festivals across the City.  True and correct copies of the outreach flyers and posters \n6  are attached hereto as Exhibit Q.  At some of these events, the Department will do a slide presentation, \n7  a true and correct copy of relevant excerpts of which is attached hereto as Exhibit R.  The Department \n8  pays to post informational materials on the interior of 1,000 Muni vehicles, on the exterior of 100 \n9  Muni vehicles, and inside 22 Muni and BART stations.  A true and correct copy of those informational \n10  materials is attached hereto as Exhibit S.  The Department also delivers and mails the materials to \n11  community-based organizations, such as Chinese for Affirmative Action, LGBT Community Center, \n12  and the Mission Economic Development Agency, as well as to schools, City departments, and \n13  libraries.  True and correct copies of the outreach flyers and posters are attached hereto as Exhibit Q.  \n14  Finally, the Department has placed ads in local newspapers such as San Francisco Examiner, SF \n15  Weekly, Bay Area Reporter, 14 San Francisco neighborhood newspapers, the Asian Journal, \n16  Philippine News, Vietnam Daily News, Sing Tao, World Journal, La Opinion de la Bahia, El Tecolote, \n17  Nichi Bei Weekly, and the Korean Times.  A true and correct copy of an exemplar ad is attached \n18  hereto as Exhibit T. \n19  19.  Many election materials, such as many of the documents, websites, and ballots \n20  referenced above are available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Filipino.  The Department provides \n21  voters with multiple opportunities to select their preferred language, and once the voter has expressed \n22  a preference, all materials received will be in English and that language.  \n23   \n24  The Department’s Efforts to Inform Voters Who Have Expressed a Party Preference That They May \n25  Change That Preference. \n26  20.  The Department has made extensive efforts to inform voters who have expressed a \n27  party preference that they may re-register. \n28 \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  6 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 8 of 13\n \n1  21.  First, the VIP contains a discussion of “Voting in the June 2016 Presidential Primary \n2  Election” and explains how voters can change their party preference.  See Ex. D at 12-13.  \n3  22.  Second, every envelope containing a vote-by-mail ballot sent to San Francisco voters \n4  includes a “Voting Instructions” guide that states: “If you chose a party preference when you \n5  registered to vote, the enclosed ballot includes, among other contests, all contests specific to that party. \n6  If you want to change your political party preference, you must reregister to vote by May 23.”  See Ex. \n7  B.  This guide is also available on the Department’s website, on a section of the site devoted to \n8  “Voting in the June 7, 2016, Election.”  See Ex. B. \n9  23.  Third, every voter who uses the Department’s voter registration tool to determine if he \n10  is registered to vote, the political party for which he is registered, and his polling place is informed that \n11  he may change his party preference.  See Ex. F, G. \n12  24.  Fourth, as noted above, the Department sent a mailer to every household in San \n13  Francisco—over 362,000.  That mailer, among other things, informed voters they could change their \n14  party preference: “Voting June 7: To register to vote—or update your registration to change your \n15  political party, home address, or name—go to registertovote.ca.gov by May 23.”  See Ex. L.   \n16  25.  Fifth, the Department’s outreach materials, which, as noted above, have been provided \n17  to over 700 civic partners and distributed at events throughout San Francisco leading up to Election \n18  Day, inform voters that they may change their party preference.  See Ex. M-O, R-T.   \n19  26.  Additionally, the Department has provided information about how voters can change \n20  party preference via its social media posts, its help desk, and its press releases, all of which are \n21  described above. \n22  27.  When an NPP voter fills out an application to vote by mail on the Department’s \n23  website, the website states: “You may mail, deliver or fax the form to the address or fax number listed \n24  on the application.”  See Ex. I.  The address listed on the application is the Department’s office in City \n25  Hall.  In addition, the application itself states, “Deliver, mail, or fax the completed application to the \n26  address or fax number listed below.”  See Ex. J. \n27  28.  Attached hereto as Exhibit U is a true and correct copy of the Secretary of State’s vote-\n28  by-mail application. \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  7 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 9 of 13\n \n1  The Use of April 18 on the Department’s Mailers Informing NPP Voters Who Have Already Applied to \n2  Vote by Mail that They May Request a Crossover Ballot. \n3  29.  As noted above, the Department sent mailers to NPP voters informing them that they \n4  may request a crossover ballot.  See Ex. A.   \n5  30.  The Department’s goal is for voters to receive their vote-by-mail ballots three to four \n6  weeks before Election Day.  The use of the date April 18 on the mailers is not legally mandated, but is \n7  based on the operational requirements of the Department and the third-party vendor with which the \n8  Department contracts to print and assemble vote-by-mail ballots.  255,000 of San Francisco’s 467,000 \n9  registered voters have applied to vote by mail.  Given that substantial number, the vendor, which also \n10  contracts with numerous other counties in California and other states, requested two weeks to print and \n11  assemble the ballots, then have them driven from Washington to a United States Postal Service facility \n12  in Richmond, where they were placed in the mail.  Shortly after April 18, the Department sent the \n13  vendor an “extract” containing the information regarding which San Francisco voters had applied to \n14  receive vote by mail ballots and the ballots those voters should receive.  The batch of ballots generated \n15  from that extract was placed in the mail in San Francisco on May 4 and 5, 2016, such that voters likely \n16  received them three to four weeks before Election Day.  Thus far, approximately 64,000 vote-by-mail \n17  voters have voted and returned their ballots to the Department. \n18  31.  After sending the initial extract to the vendor, the Department sends supplemental \n19  extracts on a regular basis.  Once an NPP voter who has applied to vote by mail submits a request for a \n20  crossover ballot, the minimum amount of time that the vendor can process that request is \n21  approximately 72 hours, plus mailing time.  Larger extracts can take the vendor up to two weeks to \n22  process.  The vendor mails vote-by-mail ballots generated from supplemental extracts from \n23  Washington, not San Francisco; as such, mailing times are longer.   \n24  32.  The Department promptly transmits to the vendor all requests for crossover ballots \n25  from NPP voters, including requests received after April 18.  Thus, NPP voters who have applied to \n26  vote by mail and who have submitted a request for a crossover ballot will receive one, even if they \n27  submitted that request after April 18 (so long as the Department receives the request with enough time \n28  to provide the voter with a replacement ballot by Election Day).   \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  8 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 10 of 13\n \n1  33.  NPP voters who did not submit the form by April 18 received ballots that did not \n2  include a contest for President.  This is because, immediately after April 18, the Department sent the \n3  extract to the vendor, which printed and assembled the ballots and drove them to Richmond, where \n4  they were mailed on May 4 and 5.  Such voters, however, were also informed—through the numerous \n5  ways explained above, including the Voting Instructions guide included in every vote-by-mail ballot \n6  envelope—that they could still vote in a presidential primary by requesting a replacement ballot.  A \n7  link to that form is included on the Voting Instructions guide.  See Ex. B.   \n8  34.  It would be infeasible from an operational standpoint for the mailers to include a date \n9  later than April 18.  If, for example, the Department used May 31 as the deadline, voters who \n10  submitted their request on that date would not receive their vote-by-mail ballot in time to cast it.  A \n11  large extract would take the vendor two weeks to process, plus the time it would take to mail the \n12  ballots from Washington.  For instance, for November 2015 election, my own ballot was delivered to \n13  me 10 days after the vote-by-mail ballots arrived at a postal facility in San Francisco.   \n14   \n15  The June 1 Deadline for Receiving Requests for Replacement Vote-by-Mail Ballots By Voters Who \n16  Have Already Applied to Vote by Mail. \n17  35.  The Department’s ballot replacement request form states that the Department must \n18  receive the request by June 1.  This form is not an application to vote by mail.  Rather, its purpose is to \n19  allow a person who has already applied to vote by mail to obtain a replacement vote-by-mail ballot.  \n20  For this reason, the form does not state that the deadline to apply to vote by mail is June 1; but rather, \n21  it says that a person who has already applied to vote by mail may obtain a replacement ballot (that \n22  includes a crossover ballot) by submitting the form to the Department by June 1.  \n23  36.  The Department must receive replacement requests by June 1 in order to ensure that \n24  voters receive their replacement ballots in time to actually cast their votes.  Before using this June 1 \n25  date, the Department was informed by the United States Post Office that items mailed using first class \n26  postage may require three to five days to be delivered to a voter in San Francisco.  After ballot \n27  replacement requests are received, the Department must process them, compile a replacement ballot, \n28 \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  9 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 11 of 13\n \n1  then mail it to the voter.  Requests received after June 1 run the risk of not reaching the voter until \n2  after Election Day, after which point the vote could not be counted.  See Cal. Elections Code § 3020. \n3   \n4  Plaintiffs’ Declarations \n5  37.  I have reviewed the Declaration of Tanya Mena, in which she alleges that she “changed \n6  her registration to Democratic so I was certain I could vote for a Democratic candidate in the \n7  Presidential primary.”   Because Ms. Mena is an NPP voter who has applied to vote by mail, the \n8  Department sent her two mailers (because she changed addresses), one of which she returned to the \n9  Department, requesting a ballot for the Democratic presidential primary.  Upon receipt of Ms. Mena’s \n10  request, the Department mailed Ms. Mena, on May 13, 2016, a ballot for the Democratic presidential \n11  primary.  I know this because the Department maintains transaction logs that include the names of all \n12  registered San Francisco voters and reflect, among other things, whether and when a vote-by-mail \n13  ballot was mailed to them, and if so, which ballot.  I personally checked this transaction log on May \n14  27, 2016, which indicated that the Department sent Ms. Mena a Democratic presidential primary ballot \n15  on May 13, 2016.   \n16  38.  In Ms. Mena’s declaration, she states that she “changed her registration to Democratic \n17  so I was certain I could vote for a Democratic candidate in the Presidential primary.”  This is not \n18  accurate, as the Department has no record of any attempt by Ms. Mena to re-register.  If Ms. Mena had \n19  re-registered to vote, that would appear in the transaction log.  Ms. Mena registered to vote in 2014  \n20  and there is no record that she re-registered.  The fact that the Department sent Ms. Mena a \n21  Democratic presidential primary ballot was not because she re-registered as a Democrat (she is still \n22  registered as an NPP voter) but because she submitted one of the mailers. \n23  39.  I have also reviewed the Declaration of Clara Daims submitted by Plaintiffs.  Ms. \n24  Daims indicates that she is worried that there will not be sufficient Democratic ballots.  This concern \n25  is unfounded, as the Department has ordered ballots for all parties far in excess of what will \n26  realistically be needed.  Ms. Daims states that she has seen a “circular” stating “to request a ballot that \n27  includes the presidential primary contest of one of these parties, mark the name of the party on the \n28  attached postage-paid postcard. . . .”  Ms. Daims is not a registered vote-by-mail voter, and as such, \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  10 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 12 of 13\n \n1  these mailers would not have been sent to her.  If Ms. Daims votes in person, poll workers have been \n2  trained to inform her that she can vote in one of the three presidential primaries.   \n3   \n4  Service of Documents on the Department \n5  40.  On May 28, 2016, someone dropped off at the Department the Amended Complaint, a \n6  Summons, and this Court’s Supplemental Order to Initial Order Setting Case Management \n7  Conference.  No other documents related to this lawsuit have been provided to the Department. \n8   \n9  Extending Voter Registration Until Election Day \n10  41.  Extending the voter registration deadline to Election Day would likely be fatal to the \n11  Department’s ability to conduct the election.  There are currently about 397,000 San Franciscans who \n12  have not registered to vote and millions more people throughout the state who have not registered.  \n13  Ordering Election Day registration would be tantamount to requiring the Department to allow every \n14  single person who showed up at a polling place on Election Day to cast a ballot.  If this happened, the \n15  election would be plunged into chaos, as the Department has not prepared for such vast numbers of \n16  people, nor could the Department prepare for such numbers in such a short time.   \n17  42.  Planning for and running an election is an incredibly complex process that requires the \n18  Department to make a series of projections related to possible voter turnout based on the number of \n19  registered voters.  These projections inform the number of polling places; the number of ballots, \n20  provisional ballots, and ballot envelopes to order; the number of poll workers; the number of field \n21  support personnel; and countless other operational requirements.  The projections also inform how the \n22  Department staffs and organizes the Voting Center at City Hall.  In addition, poll rosters, which \n23  consist of a list of registered voters for each precinct, must be created.  These projections and poll \n24  rosters are based on registration affidavits voters completed 15 days or more before an election.   \n25  43.  Opening up the polls on Election Day to 397,000 new voters (plus the literally millions \n26  of Bay Area voters who could attempt to vote in San Francisco on election day if the Court ordered the \n27  Department to give a ballot to anyone who requested one) is simply impossible from an operational \n28  standpoint.  Polls very likely could run out of ballots.  Additionally, even if sufficient ballot were \nDec. of San Francisco Director of Elections John Arntz  11 n:\\ethics\\li2016\\161255\\01109907.docx\nCase No.  CV-16-2739 WHA \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 35   Filed 05/31/16   Page 13 of 13\n \n1  available, the Department has ordered, had manufactured, and will distribute a set number of the \n2  envelopes used for identifying and separating ballots cast by voters with no registration record.  This \n3  latter example is considered “provisional” voting and the envelopes are known as “provisional” \n4  envelopes.  Opening up the polls to 397,000 new voters would create a major risk that the Department \n5  would run out of provisional envelopes as well.  In addition, poll workers and field support personnel \n6  would not have the means to support unlimited voting at the polls.  Further, the Voting Center at City \n7  Hall is organized and staffed to support the voting of a certain percentage of actual, registered voters \n8  and would be unable to properly serve voters properly registered if a substantial numbered of \n9  unexpected voters appeared.   \n10   \n11  I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

COMPLAINT TO CONFORM WITH PROOF \n13     \nALEX PADILLA, et al.,      Date:  7/12/16 \n14 \n     Time: 11:00 am \n    Defendants.      Dept:  8, Hon. William Alsup \n15 \n \n16   \n        \n \n17 \n             Plaintiffs respectfully ask the court to determine at the July 12 hearing if this case can go \n18 \nany further.  Plaintiffs waive any defect caused by San Francisco’s filing on June 20 and ask the \n19 \ncourt for guidance now.   Plaintiffs will move the court separately to accept this larger-than-15 \n20 \npage brief. \n21 \nThe 2016 primary election is over – but its legacy continues.  Millions of Californians \n22 \nnow feel let down by their voting system.  The battle for the no-party-preference voters \n23 \ncontinues. \n24 \n            The best remedy for their plight is uniform voting standards consistent with 52 USC \n25 \n10101(a)(2)(A).  For this reason, Plaintiffs seek to continue this lawsuit, and to amend the \n26 \ncomplaint before San Francisco’s motion is heard on August 18, 2016.  Otherwise, the \n27 \ndiscriminatory treatment of the NPPs will be repeated in 2020. \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 2 of 22\n \n1   \n2  I.   PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT TO \n3  CONFORM \n4  WITH PROOF \n5  A.   This lawsuit began with realizing how San Francisco had misled its \n6 \nvoters \n7 \nPlaintiffs seek leave to amend the complaint to conform with the documents \n8 \nsubmitted prior to the injunction hearing on June 1, 2016.  In the week after the \n9 \ncomplaint was filed, Plaintiffs learned first-hand about a raft of abuses involving the \n10 \npoll workers in the County of Alameda.    \n11 \n12  This case was filed following the revelations about the City and County of San \n13  Francisco, as documented in the previously filed declaration of counsel. \n14 \nAs stated in Exhibit 11A-D of the Roguski Declaration, counsel has provided \n15 \ndocuments that are a major basis of the contentions regarding San Francisco.  Exhibit \n16 \n11A is a notice informing the voters how “to request a ballot that includes the \n17 \npresidential primary contest of one of these parties, mark the name of the party on the \n18 \nattached postage-paid postcard, and sign and return the postcard no later than April \n19 \n20  18.  If you do not request the ballot of one of these parties, your ballot will not \n21  include a contest for President.”   The impact to the reasonable voter is clear – if you \n22 \ndon’t return the postcard by April 18, your ballot will not include a contest for \n23 \nPresident.  Ms. Mena, in her declaration, explains that she changed her registration \n24 \nfrom NPP to Democrat to heighten the chance she could vote for President after \n25 \nseeing this notice shortly after April 18. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 3 of 22\n \n1  Counsel went to the Elections office on Thursday, May 19 and obtained a copy of \n2 \nthe postcard that was attached to Exhibit 11-A by showing 11-A to the election \n3 \nworker and asking for a copy of the attached postcard.  That copy is attached as \n4 \nExhibit 11B to the Roguski Declaration.  It contains a request for a vote-by-mail \n5 \nballot but provides the wrong date – pursuant to Elections Code 3006, any application \n6 \nfor a vote by mail ballot such as Exhibit 11B must be requested by May 31.  This \n7 \n8  application states that the deadline is June 1.  The consequence of missing this \n9  deadline will mean that voters by mail will not receive by mail their ballot to vote for \n10 \nPresident, even though they are expecting it.  It is a matter of common knowledge \n11 \nthat a high percentage of California voters vote by mail.  On information and belief, \n12 \nplaintiffs believe that the number varies between ½ to 2/3 of the populace.  Similarly, \n13 \nit is common knowledge that a substantial number of voters in the state are no party \n14 \npreference; my understanding is that number is somewhere between  23% to 25%.   \n15 \n16  This indicates that hundreds of thousands of NPP votes are at stake in this primary \n17  election; especially in light of a recent May 25 US News & World Report article \n18 \nstating that at that time 50% of the NPP voters are Democrats, but only 14% of them \n19 \nat that time had received vote-by-mail ballots back in the mail.        \n20 \n  These statistics are found in this widely circulated US News and World Report \n21 \narticle:  http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/bernies-ballot-burden-in-\n22 \ncalifornia.     \n23 \n24  The next problem manifested when the City and County of San Francisco sent out \n25 \nthe Voter Information Pamphlet and Sample Ballot in early May.  Counsel discussed \n26 \nhis problem with Mr. White in mid-May in a letter exchange.  Mr. White took the \n27 \nposition that the Elections Code 3006(c) to all voter only needed to be given to NPP \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 4 of 22\n \n1  voters.  It is counsel’s belief it needs to be given to all voters pursuant to the statute \n2 \nand the statutory scheme of which 3006 is a part.  Section 3000 states in essence that \n3 \nit is to be construed in a light most helpful to voters.         \n4 \n  Counsel believes that all voters need to have access to the 3006 notice in the \n5 \nstatute, because some of those voters may have switched to NPP status or may be \n6 \nconsidering such a switch, and they are entitled to this information in order to make \n7 \n8  an informed decision.  Mr. White is of the completely opposite opinion, saying that \n9  providing such a notice in an application to vote by mail would be more confusing to \n10 \nvoters.                       \n11 \n      A document contrasting the party and NPP sample ballot in San Francisco is \n12 \nattached as Exhibit 11C in the Roguski declaration.  Counsel provided these materials \n13 \nin Exhibit 11 to Mr Roguski for inclusion in his declaration.    \n14 \nA problem with both defendant counties is that they are distributing the \n15 \n16  applications to vote by mail by electronic mail on their website.  See Exhibit 8-9, \n17  Roguski Declaration.  Defense counsel for both counties state that in both counties, if \n18 \nyou enter your data into the form, then the NPP data is provided to you and you get \n19 \nthat information.  However, it is a “distribution” to post these forms on a public \n20 \nwebsite where citizens perusing the website and trying to make intelligent decisions \n21 \nare not given the NPP information unless they log their data into the site and \n22 \npush“submit”.  This violates Election Code 3006(c) and 3007.7, which incorporates \n23 \n24  3006(c) in its provisions in the electronic context of “distribution”.       \n25 \n  Counsel was unable to get San Francisco or Alameda to change this practice, but \n26 \ncounsel did convince San Mateo County to do so and Plaintiffs did not sue them as a \n27 \nresult of that positive gesture.  The Roguski Declaration, as a general matter, \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 5 of 22\n \n1  chronicles from Exhibits 1-14 defects in applications pursuant to 3006 as well as \n2 \nfaulty instructions throughout the state. \n3 \nIt should be added that San Francisco failed to inform their voters pursuant to \n4 \n3006(b)(3) that voters applying to vote by mail have the right to deliver their \n5 \napplication directly to the elections county office by May 31.  They are not limited to \n6 \nhaving to do it by mail.  What made it worse is that San Francisco informed the voters \n7 \n8  that the deadline to return the vote-by-mail application was June 1 – another act of \n9  potential disenfranchisement.  \n10 \n \n11 \nB.    It became clear that voters and poll workers were suffering from mass \n12 \nconfusion \n13 \nVoters suffered from mass confusion.  Besides the aforementioned Ms. Mena’s \n14 \nconfusion that led to her switch from NPP to Democratic, plaintiff and NPP registrant \n15 \n16  Ms. Daims was concerned as well about whether she will be able to vote the \n17  Democratic ballot.  Also concerned was Gary Remer, a voter in Monterey, whose \n18 \ndeclaration shows that he made a similar switch and witnessed great confusion in this \n19 \ncounty board of elections about who gets to vote in this election for President and \n20 \nhow.   Also concerned was Richard Troy, a voter in Alameda County:  His detailed \n21 \ndeclaration shows that despite his deep interest in the process of voting, his \n22 \nexperiences with the county board of elections in Alameda left him completely \n23 \n24  confused.                      \n25 \n  Mimi Kennedy, a veteran poll worker in Los Angeles County, recounted how \n26 \nmany people made mistakes in the past about thinking that the American Independent \n27 \nParty was the same as no party preference; how many voters are forced to vote \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 6 of 22\n \n1  provisionally due to failure to bring their vote-by-mail ballots with them to the polls \n2 \nto “surrender” for a replacement ballot; and several other issues that illustrate why \n3 \nvoters are suffering from great confusion with this primary.   \n4 \nAs counsel never heard from Alameda County counsel despite his post and his \n5 \ncall to the defendant Tim Dupuis on May 13, 2016, Plaintiffs filed suit against both \n6 \nentities and the Secretary of State on May 20.  Plaintiffs learned that there was an \n7 \n8  issue in counties about forcing NPP voters to vote provisionally if they wanted to vote \n9  for President, as in San Diego (see Declaration of Jennifer Abreu and Exhibits – even \n10 \nthe training materials include this admonition to give NPP presidential voters \n11 \nprovisional ballots – on information and belief, these votes are not included in the \n12 \ncount until two to four weeks after the election, and only 85% of the time according \n13 \nto leading voter analyst Paul Mitchell), so Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include \n14 \nthat issue.  \n15 \n16  However, in the days ahead counsel was provided a number of very serious \n17  reports stating that in some counties the poll workers were being trained to not inform \n18 \nNPP voters that they had the right to receive a Presidential primary ballot.  Counsel \n19 \nsifted through these numerous reports and obtained declarations from the \n20 \naforementioned Ms. Abreu of San Diego, Jeff Lewis of Santa Clara County, and \n21 \nAshley Beck of Orange County.  All of them said that they were told not to inform \n22 \nthe voter of this right, but to provide the Presidential primary ballot only when the \n23 \n24  voter asked for it.   \n25 \nConversely, witnesses such as Michelle Jenab of Los Angeles stated that they \n26 \nwere trained to ask the NPP voter if they would like a Presidential primary ballot.  \n27 \n(Note that despite counsel’s best efforts counsel was able to include where she signed \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 7 of 22\n \n1  the document, but she informed counsel that she signed it in the County of Los \n2 \nAngeles on May 26 – the date is reflected in the electronic signature.) Joshua White, \n3 \nthe attorney for the City and County of San Francisco on election matters as counsel \n4 \nunderstands it from his conversations with him, has told counsel that the City is \n5 \ninforming NPP voters that they can request a Presidential primary ballot, and that it is \n6 \nreflected in their training materials, and counsel presently has no evidence to dispute \n7 \n8  this assertion and does not make this request regarding the San Francisco defendants. \n9  However, the Secretary of State’s counsel Ms. Sharon O’Grady informed counsel \n10 \non May 27 that it is her understanding that the law is that the voter must request the \n11 \nballot and that there is no duty of the official to offer the ballot – that was counsel’s \n12 \nunderstanding of counsel’s conversation with her on that point.  Her own training \n13 \nmaterials illustrate that her office states that NPP voters should be advised of the right \n14 \nto obtain a Presidential ballot, a copy is attached as Exhibit 1 to this declaration, see \n15 \n16  page 3.   \n17  However, the Secretary’s brief at the time of the injunction hearing stated that \n18 \n“The Secretary of State’s poll workers instruction guide encourages poll workers to \n19 \naffirmatively ask NPP voters if they wish to request a party presidential ballot. But \n20 \nthe fact that the Secretary of State encourages, and elections officials may choose to \n21 \ninstruct poll workers to do more than is legally required does not mean that a failure \n22 \nto do so a violation of the Elections Code.”  (Docket 36, pp. 14-15) \n23 \n24  The Secretary of State has offered a blueprint for gaming the system. \n25 \nC.  After the complaint was filed, Alameda’s intra-county problems emerged \n26 \nThe County of Alameda has written counsel and states that their training materials \n27 \nshow that poll workers are trained to inform the NPP voter of their right to receive a \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 8 of 22\n \n1  Presidential ballot.  Plaintiffs’ two Alameda County poll worker witnesses are \n2 \nGabrielle Dolphin (who is a poll worker judge) and pollworker Dawn DelMonte.  Ms. \n3 \nDolphin came away from her training with the understanding that individual poll \n4 \nworkers were free to do as they liked – to inform or not to inform the NPP voter that \n5 \nthey had the right to request a Presidential party ballot.  Ms. DelMonte had the \n6 \nexperience of her trainer contradicting the training video which said that the poll \n7 \n8  worker shall inform the NPP voter of the right to request a Presidential party ballot.  \n9  She says the trainer said do not provide that information, but wait for the voter to \n10 \nrequest a Presidential party ballot.  The trainer’s denial of Ms DelMonte’s \n11 \nrecollections does not negate Plaintiffs’ right to rely on her account in this suit.  \n12 \n  Plaintiff’s suit, if amended, will allege that poll workers must be uniformly \n13 \ntrained to ask NPP voters whether they want to vote for a presidential candidate in \n14 \nany of the three crossover parties. A training manual doesn't provide a remedy for an \n15 \n16  NPP voter who doesn't know their rights. The manual is not dispositive of what is \n17  actually said to voters at the polling places, or how the trainers were actually trained. \n18 \nThe words in the manual do not prove what words are said to the voter in the polling \n19 \nplace, or what words were said to the trainer in the training. \n20 \n        The content of the pages relating to crossover voting for nonpartisan voters in \n21 \nthe Alameda County poll worker clerk manual  (pp 43-44, see exhibit 1 to Gabrielle \n22 \nDolphin’s declaration at docket numbers 14 and 20) is the same as the one for \n23 \n24  judges/inspectors (pp 67-70), except visually more material is crammed onto one \n25 \npage for the clerks. In two instances, at the bottom of the respective slides, poll \n26 \nworkers are told to \"advise the Nonpartisan voters they are entitled to vote \n27 \nnonpartisan or in one of the following parties: American Independent, Democratic, \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 9 of 22\n \n1  Libertarian.\"  The \"Roster-Index Page: Crossover Voting for Nonpartisan Voters\" \n2 \npage of the inspector manual appears to be an empty green field below the title. (Page \n3 \n70 in the judge/inspector manual, and not in the clerk manual at all).  \n4 \n      In both of the Alameda County poll worker training manuals, there is no mention \n5 \nof Presidential candidates in the nonpartisan crossover voting, unlike in the Los \n6 \nAngeles poll worker training handbook, which specifically instructs poll workers to \n7 \n8  ask NPP voters whether they wish to vote for the Presidential candidate for the \n9  American Independent, Democratic or Libertarian party. This subtle difference points \n10 \nto an example of how low information voters can be confused. They might not \n11 \nunderstand that their No Party Preference / NP/ Nonpartisan ballot is missing a \n12 \nPresidential candidate, and most importantly, that the only way they get to vote for a \n13 \nPresidential candidate is by casting one of the crossover ballots. They might not \n14 \nrealize that the crossover ballots simply only add the Presidential candidate to their \n15 \n16  choice of down ballot nonpartisan candidates and that they are not betraying their \n17  independent status by choosing a crossover ballot.  \n18 \n        It is entirely possible that the County of Alameda is working very hard to make \n19 \nthe voting experience a positive one – and the same for San Francisco, and their \n20 \npositive efforts should be commended, however, it is in these subtle wording and \n21 \nvisual choices involving both the training materials and the applications to vote for \n22 \nmail and attendant instructions that have important information has been omitted (or \n23 \n24  ambiguously phrased) to the serious detriment of nonpartisan voters. We have \n25 \nidentified these subtle differences, and are concerned that many nonpartisan voters \n26 \nare not informed in a sufficiently clear manner what their rights and duties are. We \n27 \nrealize it is a daunting task, but we also wish to help those voters get all the \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 10 of 22\n \n1  information they need, in as clear and accurate way as possible, to successfully vote \n2 \naccording to their wishes. \n3 \nII.  THEORIES BEHIND PLAINTIFFS’ CAUSES OF ACTION \n4 \nThis action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to secure equitable relief from \n5 \nDefendants’ unlawful deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights, privileges and immunities \n6 \nguaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \n7 \n8  States Constitution; Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. \n9  10101(a)(2)(A) and (B).  Plaintiff is not seeking a writ of mandamus at this time, and \n10 \nseeks to dismiss this cause of action with leave to amend.   \n11 \n“No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the \n12 \nelection of those who make the laws…” Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964). \n13 \nPlaintiffs bring the instant lawsuit to protect the right to vote by mail, early voting, \n14 \nregistration, and informational voting rights of millions of California voters. Nearly 70% \n15 \n16  of ballots cast in the 2014 California special election were by mail, and over 65% of the \n17  ballots cast in the 2012 presidential preference primary were by mail. \n18 \nhttp://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-absentee/  \n19 \nThe impact of failure to inform NPP voters (no party preference voters) of their \n20 \nright to obtain a “crossover ballot” and to vote in the Presidential primary was significant, \n21 \nas is the failure to inform party-affiliated voters of their right to re-register as no party \n22 \npreference voters and still receive the Presidential primary ballots of the Democratic, \n23 \n24  American Independent, and Libertarian parties. All Californians’ voting rights have been \n25 \nand will continue to be denied or unreasonably infringed upon due to the lack of \n26 \noversight of the California Secretary of State and county Boards of Elections.    \n27 \n     This action seeks injunctive relief to redress the widespread and ongoing \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 11 of 22\n \n1  failure to provide information regarding the protected voting rights of “no party \n2 \npreference” voters to receive a Democratic, American Independent or Libertarian \n3 \npresidential ballot. Inadequate information has also been provided regarding the right of \n4 \n“no party preference voters” to personally deliver their application to vote by mail to the \n5 \ncounty board of elections office by May 31, 2016 in order to mail their ballot in by the \n6 \nlast day of the primary on June 7.  \n7 \n8  This failure to provide adequate information is in violation of the Voting Rights \n9  Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C.A. § 10101 et seq, California Elections Code Section 3000 et seq., \n10 \nand the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of Equal Protection, applied to states pursuant to \n11 \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs are eligible California voters (one Democratic and \n12 \none no party preference); Voting Rights Defense Project (an organization campaigning to \n13 \nheighten voter education and voter turnout for their candidate Bernie Sanders); and the \n14 \nAmerican Independent Party itself.  \n15 \n16  III.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION – 52 USC 10101(a)(2)(A) \n17  Defendants’ actions violate 52 USC 10101(a)(2), generally known as “Section 2” of the \n18 \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant \n19 \npart: (2) No person acting under color of law shall – (A) in determining whether any individual is \n20 \nqualified under State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard, practice, or procedure \n21 \ndifference from the standards, practices or procedures applied under such law or laws to other \n22 \nindividuals within the same county, parish, or similar political subdivision who have been found by \n23 \nState officials to be qualified to vote. . .                \n24 \n      Private litigants may enforce their rights under 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a) by \n25 \n26  bringing a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants, acting under color of state law, applied different \n27  standards, practices, or procedures in determining whether party voters would be given voter \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 12 of 22\n \n1  informational rights than were applied to no party preference voters.   Jeffers v. Clinton, 730 F. \n2 \nSupp. 196, 204 (E.D. Ark. 1989) (three-judge court) (Arnold, J.) (finding that section 2 of the \n3 \nVoting Rights Act \"should be construed liberally in favor of its object, which is to open up the \n4 \nelectoral process to full participation\").   There is nothing in the statute that limits this cause of \n5 \naction to “voter registration”.  The facts here illustrate a long series of intra-county and inter-\n6 \ncounty practices where some counties provide the necessary NPP information to NPP voters and \n7 \n8  some do not; some provide the requisite vote by mail information to all voters and some do not; \n9  and some poll workers provide the information needed to NPP voters and some do not.  This is \n10 \nan elementary violation of the statute.  Compare the declarations of the poll workers in San \n11 \nDiego, Orange, and Santa Clara (no notice given) with the policies of San Francisco and Los \n12 \nAngeles (notice given) with the custom of Alameda (Plaintiffs’ evidence indicates that poll \n13 \nworkers decide for themselves whether or not notice will be given).    \n14 \n15 \nThe Secretary of State Alex Padilla is named as an indispensable party. The Secretary of \n16 \nState created the regulations that the Elections Code rely on. On information and belief, the Secretary \n17 \nof State failed to properly advise the other Defendants, despite the enormous autonomy that the \n18 \nDefendants enjoy in running their own affairs free of interference from the Secretary.   The \n19 \nSecretary’s role in encouraging the counties to “game the system”, as described in Docket 36, pp. 14-\n20 \n21  15, is illustrative. \n22 \n  In Wash. Ass'n of Churches v. Reed, 492 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n23 \n96444 (W.D. Wash. 2006) the court addressed defendant's argument that he is not the proper \n24 \n25  defendant to this action. Defendant initially asserted that, while he maintains the voter statewide \n26 \nregistration list, the counties actually register voters, and therefore he has no direct control over \n27 \nthe 39 separately-elected county auditors. Defendant further asserted that these county auditors \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 13 of 22\n \n1  are not his \"agents,\" such that he could somehow order the counties to register mismatched \n2 \napplicants. \n3 \n4 \nPlaintiffs responded that defendant had undersold his     , and that he indeed is the proper \n5 \ndefendant. As in Washington state, the Secretary of State is the chief elections officer of the \n6 \nstate, and he has supervisory control over local elections officials, including the power and \n7 \nresponsibility to issue instructions and promulgate rules to ensure that elections are conducted in \n8 \na uniform manner.  The powers are not as strong as in Washington state, but the facts in this case \n9 \n10  from the poll workers and the applications to vote by mail show that the Secretary of State is not \n11  conducting sufficient guidance in a uniform manner. \n12 \nIV. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) and 42 USC 1983)  \n13 \n52 USC 10101(a)(2)(B) grants rights to voters by providing, in relevant part: \"No person \n14 \nacting under color of state law shall … deny the right of any individual to vote in any election \n15 \nbecause of an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or \n16 \nother act requisite to voting, if such error or omission is not material in determining whether such \n17 \n18  individual is qualified under State law to vote in such election.\" See Schwier v. Cox, 412 F. \n19  Supp. 2d 1266 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (finding a Georgia requirement that voting registrants disclose \n20 \nSocial Security number before voting violated materiality provision of Voting Rights Act), aff'd, \n21 \n439 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir. 2006).                  \n22 \n    Certain Plaintiffs – or the individuals that they represent - are in imminent danger \n23 \nof being denied the right to vote in the Presidential primary election because of the errors and \n24 \nomissions contained in the mandatory notices containing crucial information necessary in order \n25 \n26  to obtain the ballot. These errors or omissions are not material in determining whether these \n27 \nindividuals are qualified under State law to vote in the June 2016 Presidential primary election.  \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 14 of 22\n \n1  Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23739, 18 Fla. L. \n2 \nWeekly Fed. D 63 (S.D. Fla. 2004)  offers the best guidance in this situation.  After analysis, the \n3 \ncourt ruled against the Plaintiffs because the errors or omissions did not happen in a record or \n4 \npaper.  In this instance, the 3006 and 3007.7 violations occurred in precisely this manner.  The \n5 \nfact  that Defendants got it right sometimes does not excuse the statutory violation.   It is a \n6 \nserious error and omission that fundamentally impacts the voter’s rights to information.   Voters \n7 \n8  have informational rights that must be assiduously respected.  \n9 \nPlaintiffs’ theory is that defendants have violated Section 10101(a)(2)(B) by omitting the \n10 \nstatements regarding no-party- preference voters from materials distributed to voters that had \n11 \nindicated a party preference.  Dkt. 46 at 4.  \n12 \n13 \nSection 10101(a)(2)(B) applies when there is some error or omission in any record or paper \n14 \nrelating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting. 52 USCS § \n15 \n10101(a)(2)(B). In applying §10101(a)(2)(B), courts consider state voter qualification law and \n16 \nwhether the alleged error or omission is material to that law. It should not be material, i.e., \n17 \nsection 10101(a)(2)(B) applies in the presence of an immaterial requirement that only serves to \n18 \n19  disfranchise voters. See, e.g., Churches, 492 F. Supp. 2d 1264; Schwier, 412 F. Supp. 2d 1266.  \n20 \nThe other prong of the inquiry is whether said error or omission  \n21 \n22  causes an individual to be denied the right to vote. 52 USCS § 10101(a)(2)(B).  \n23 \nCase law is somewhat disfavorable based on the facts at hand. In Friedman v. Snipes, the \n24 \nplaintiffs were unable to vote by mail because of delays at the registrar’s office. 345 F. Supp. 2D \n25 \n26  1356, 1358 (S.D. Fla. 2004). The court held that, “because the error and omission alleged here \n27  did not occur on any record or paper and did not occur in relationship to a determination of the \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 15 of 22\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ eligibility to vote, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success on \n2 \nthe merits of a claim of violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1971(a)(2)(B). Id. at 1373.  \n3 \nThe court reasoned: “Nothing in my review of the case law in this jurisdiction or in other \n4 \n5  jurisdictions indicates that section 1971(a)(2)(B) was intended to apply to the counting of ballots \n6  by individuals already deemed qualified to vote.” Id. At 1371. “This is especially true in the \n7 \ncontext of absentee ballots, because there is no fundamental right to vote by absentee ballot.” Id. \n8 \nat 1370. Further, omitting the ballot as a whole from the batch of absentee ballots was not a \n9 \nqualifying error or omission because it was not “on” a record or paper. Id. At 1373.  \n10 \n11  In every case in which relief was granted based on section 10101(a)(2)(B), the error or omission \n12 \nwas related to a registration form with a nonmaterial requirement such as a social security \n13 \nnumber. Schwier, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 1276–77 (holding defendant violated Voting Right Act in \n14 \ndenying plaintiffs right to register to vote because they refused to disclose their SSNs); \n15 \nChurches, 492 F. Supp. 2D at 1271 (holding plaintiffs demonstrated strong likelihood of success \n16 \non merits of claim that matching requirement is in direct conflict with “materiality” provision); \n17 \n18  Fla. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1182-83, 1188 (11th Cir. Fla. 2008) \n19  (holding Voting Rights Act violated by registration requirement for driver’s license, last four \n20 \ndigits of social security number, and matching).  \n21 \nHowever, we argue that the present situation differs from that in Friedman because the errors or \n22 \n23  omissions at issue here did occur on paper and did occur in relationship to a determination of the \n24  Plaintiff’s eligibility to vote for president. Additionally, in the 9th circuit case, Churches, the \n25 \ncourt applied 10101(a)(2)(B) more liberally than the court in Friedman.  \n26 \nANALYSIS  \n27 \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 16 of 22\n \n1  First, we argue that Defendants have misconstrued our 10101(a)(2)(B) argument to be about \n2 \n“failing to tell voters who have disclosed a preference for a qualified political party that that they \n3 \n“have declined to disclose a preference for a qualified political party,” Arntz MTD, Dkt. 51 at 10 \n4 \n(quoting Compl. ¶ 8) or that they should have “given no-party- preference voter information to \n5 \nparty-affiliated voters.” Padilla MTD, Dkt. 48 at 11.  \n6 \n7 \nThe primary error or omission was Defendants’ “failure to inform NPP voters (no party \n8 \npreference voters) of their right to obtain a ‘crossover ballot’ and to vote in the Presidential \n9 \nprimary.” Amended Compl. ¶ 3. Specifically, Defendants Tim Dupuis and John Arntz . . . \n10 \ndistributed to the voters an electronic application to vote for mail on Dupuis’ Oakland website \n11 \nand Artnz’s San Francisco website that violated Elections Code § 3006(c) and 3007.7(e). Both of \n12 \n13  these applications failed to provide the mandatory notice to all voters of their right to state no \n14  party preference; and, further, that a no party preference voter shall be provided with a \n15 \nDemocratic, American Independent Party or a Libertarian Party Presidential primary ballot.”  \n16 \nId. ¶ 8. Registrars around the state failed to inform NPP voters how they could vote for a \n17 \n18  presidential candidate, as is required by the Elections code. Another huge problem related to \n19  registration happened in the interim when thousands of voters went missing from the registration \n20 \nrolls or had their registrations inexplicably changed. At best, this was an “error or omission” on \n21 \nthe part of registrars. See Stephanie Dube Dwilson, Election Fraud: Why Are Voter Registrations \n22 \nChanging?, HEAVY, http://heavy.com/news/2016/04/election-fraud- voter-registration-changed-\n23 \nsuppression- party-affiliation- sanders-clinton- ca-ny- az-md- pa-what- to-do/ (April 13, 2016);  \n24 \n25 \nCalifornia Primary - A Case of Highway Robbery, \n26 \nhttp://www.caucus99percent.com/content/california-primary-case- highway-robbery (June 8, \n27 \n2016).  \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 17 of 22\n \n1  Many people were in fact denied the right to vote for a presidential candidate because of this \n2 \nomission.  Exit polls point to massive numbers of NPP voters who were unable to vote for \n3 \npresident because they were not properly instructed how to do so: Exit polling of independent, \n4 \nvote-by- mail voters is showing that 40 percent wanted to vote for a Democratic presidential \n5 \ncandidate, but only 15 percent requested a Democratic ballot, Political Data, Inc. Vice President \n6 \nPaul Mitchell said. “They just didn’t have the Democratic candidates on their ballot and didn’t \n7 \n8  know how to get them, get the right ballot or get their ballot replaced, Mitchell said.  \n9 \nSharokina Shams, Many CA independent voters left out of presidential primary, KCRA NEWS,  \n10 \n11  http://www.kcra.com/news/many-ca- independent-voters- left-out- of-presidential- \n12 \nprimary/39854480 (June 1, 2016).  \n13 \nAn early exit poll conducted by Capitol Weekly found that 60 percent of nonpartisan voters \n14 \n15  either thought they would automatically receive a Democratic ballot or didn’t understand the \n16  process. Indeed, an analysis of the 322,000 nonpartisan mail ballots turned in by last Thursday \n17 \nshow that only 40 percent of them even cast a vote for president.  \n18 \nJohn Fund, California’s Crazy Election Quirks Limit Voter Choices and Create Chaos, \n19 \n20  NATIONAL REVIEW, http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436220/californias-presidential- \n21  primary-rules- are-crazy (June 5, 2016). Thus, millions of NPP voters were in fact deprived of \n22 \ntheir right to vote because of the omission of information on how to obtain a crossover ballot.  \n23 \nThe need for a crossover ballot is just the sort of unnecessary, immaterial hurdle that section  \n24 \n25 \n10101(a)(2)(B) was enacted to avoid. Being able to use a crossover ballot instead of the one \n26 \ndistributed to NPP voters in no way reads on “whether such individual is qualified under State \n27 \nlaw to vote in such election.” 52 USC § 10101(a)(2)(B). To the contrary, we are witnessing \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 18 of 22\n \n1  “state and local government tactics of using, among other things, burdensome registration \n2 \nrequirements to disenfranchise” certain voters. NAACP, 522 F.3d at 1173. This “trivial \n3 \ninformation served no purpose other than as a means of inducing voter-generated errors that \n4 \ncould be used to justify rejecting applicants.” Id. In sum, the wrongs being committed are exactly \n5 \nthe sort 52 USC § 10101(a)(2)(B) is intended to remedy.  \n6 \n7   \n8 \nV.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (First and Fourteenth Amendments, and 42 \n9 \nUSC 1983)  \n10 \nDefendants’ actions violated the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution and the \n11 \nequal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, as the acts of \n12 \nthe defendants towards the no party preference voters constituted arbitrary discrimination of \n13 \n14  these plaintiffs as well as the associational classes that Voting Rights Defense Project and \n15  American Independent Party represent.               \n16 \n  The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution require that courts closely \n17 \nscrutinize challenged election regulations, weighing “the character and magnitude of the asserted \n18 \ninjury . . . against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \n19 \nimposed by its rule.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).        \n20 \n  The facts here illustrate arbitrary discrimination.  Some CA counties send complete \n21 \n22  information to NPP voters while others fail to do so.  Similarly, there is a failure to treat similarly \n23  situated parties equally under the Elections Code.  California has a very high incidence of by-\n24 \nmail voters compared to other states.   Nearly 70% of ballots cast in the 2014 California special \n25 \nelection were by-mail, and over 65% of the ballots cast in the 2012 presidential preference \n26 \nprimary were by-mail.  http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-absentee/  Therefore, the \n27 \n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND AND OPPOSING DISMISSAL                                      \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-02739-WHA   Document 56   Filed 06/28/16   Page 19 of 22\n \n1  impact of failure to inform NPP voters of their right to vote a Presidential party ballot is \n2 \nsignificant.  \n3 \n4  Even after the enactment of the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA) eligible citizens have \n5  had to navigate \"a complicated maze of local laws and procedures\" creating obstacles to \n6 \nvoting sometimes \"as restrictive as the outlawed practices.\"  H.R.
