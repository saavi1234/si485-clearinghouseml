    "summary": "<p>This was a case about alleged denial of the right to vote. On October 27, 2015, an individual sued the State of Louisiana, the Louisiana Secretary of State Office, Louisiana Secretary of State, Tangipahoa Parish Council, Tangipahoa Parish Clerk of Court Office, Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters Office, and Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The individual asserted claims under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 96, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 207(a), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1915, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1981, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1985, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1986, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, La. Civ. Code &sect; 2315, and La. Civ. Code &sect; 2317. The case was assigned to District Judge Ivan L.R. Lemelle. Proceeding pro se, the individual sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, monetary damages, and punitive damages to redress the denial of the individual&rsquo;s right to vote and racial discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The individual alleged that the Registrar of Voters Office failed to issue him the required identification, causing him to be denied his right to vote when a polling employee of the Tangipahoa Parish Clerk of Court did not let him vote because he did not have identification that satisfied the requirements for voting. The individual additionally alleged that he was denied the right to vote due to racial discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From December 2015 through January 2016 the various defendants filed motions to dismiss the individual&rsquo;s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants contended that Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the individual&rsquo;s suit, and that the individual&rsquo;s conclusory allegations and generalizations did not substantiate his claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 11, 2016, the individual filed an opposition to defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss. The individual argued that qualified immunity did not apply because defendants violated a clearly established and well-settled right. Further, the individual argued that Defendants did indeed conspire to and did actually deny his right to vote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss the individual&rsquo;s claims, and granted leave to file an amended complaint. The Court granted the motion to dismiss the individual&rsquo;s claim that the Registrar of Voters failed to issue a photo identification card to all voters because there is no requirement that the Registrar do so. The court denied defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss as to all other claims.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, 2016, the individual filed an amended complaint against all previously named defendants, and added the Voting Commissioner and the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors as additional defendants. In the amended complaint, the individual alleged that he was unlawfully denied the right to vote due to racial discrimination and the Clerk of Court&rsquo;s failure to provide him required identification.</p>\r\n<p>From February 2016 through May 2016 various defendants filed additional motions to dismiss the individual&rsquo;s claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction because defendants were protected by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defendants further argued that the individual only provided generalizations and conclusory statements in support of his allegations, rather than offering specific facts to support his claim. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2016, the individual filed an opposition to defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss. The individual alleged that qualified immunity did not apply because defendants violated his clearly established and well-settled right to vote. Further, the individual pled more facts to support his claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 2016, the State of Louisiana, the Louisiana Secretary of State Office, Louisiana Secretary of State, Tangipahoa Parish Council, Tangipahoa Parish Clerk of Court Office, Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters Office, and Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters's motions to dismiss were granted because plaintiff did not provide adequate support for his claims, despite his opportunity to amend his complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2016 the Voting Commissioner and the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors filed a motion to dismiss the individual&rsquo;s claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Voting Commissioner and the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors argued that the Eleventh Amendment bars individuals from filing suit against the State in federal court and that the individual only presented conclusory allegations and unwarranted factual deductions insufficient to state a claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, the Court granted Defendants the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors and Patricia Hughes, in her capacity as Commissioner for the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors&rsquo; motion to dismiss, deeming the motion unopposed, and finding that the motion had merit.</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2016, Plaintiff&rsquo;s suit was dismissed, after the court granted all defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss.</p>",

SECTION \"B\"(1) \n \n \nORDER AND REASONS \n \nBefore the Court are numerous motions to dismiss. The State \nof  Louisiana,  the  Louisiana  Secretary  of  State  Office,  and \nSecretary  of  State  Tom  Schedler  (collectively  “the  State \nDefendants”) filed motions to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rec. Docs. 52, \n53. The Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters Office and Registrar \nof Voters John Russell (collectively “the Registrar Defendants”) \nalso filed motions to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of \nthe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  Rec.  Docs.  27,  28.  The \nTangipahoa Parish Clerk of Court Office and Clerk of Court Julian \nDufreche (collectively “the Clerk of Court Defendants”) filed a \nmotion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) as well as a \nmotion to strike under Rule 12(f). Rec. Doc. 29. See also Rec. \nDoc. 57. Finally, Tangipahoa Parish (“the Parish”) filed a motion \nto  dismiss  under  Rule  12(b)(6).  Rec.  Doc.  54.  The  Court  will \ncollectively refer to all of the above-mentioned defendants as \n“Movants.”  Plaintiff,  Johnny  Duncan  (hereinafter  “Duncan”  or \n“Plaintiff”),  representing  himself  pro  se,  filed  oppositions \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 2 of 15\nrelevant to each motion—all of which present essentially the same \narguments  and  adopt  by  reference  their  predecessors.1  For  the \nreasons outlined below,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the Parish’s motion to dismiss (Rec. Doc. \n54) is GRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the State Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Rec. Doc. 53) is GRANTED, and their \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) (Rec. Doc. 52) is DISMISSED \nAS MOOT. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Registrar Defendants’ motion \nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Rec. Doc. 28) is GRANTED, and their \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) (Rec. Doc. 27) is DISMISSED \nAS MOOT.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of Court Defendants’ \nmotion (Rec. Doc. 29) is GRANTED in part and DISMISSED AS MOOT in \npart, granted in all parts except for the motion to strike which \nis now moot.  \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nAs  this  Court  addressed  previously,  the  above-captioned \nmatter arises out of Plaintiff allegedly being denied the right to \nvote in a Louisiana primary election in October 2015. See Rec. \n                     \n1 According to Plaintiff, the “gravamen of the issue is that the law was \n‘clearly established’ and ‘well-settled’ enough on October 24, 2015 that \nVoting Commissioner Patricia Hughes-Sims knew or should have known that it \nwas illegal for her to deny plaintiff the right to vote.” Rec. Doc. 58 at 5. \nSee also Rec. Docs. 41, 46, 60, and 59.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 3 of 15\nDoc. 43. In a prior Order and Reasons, this Court granted in part \nand  denied  in  part  Tangipahoa  Parish’s  motion  to  dismiss, \ndismissing  some  of  Plaintiff’s  claim  while  giving  him  the \nopportunity to amend his complaint to more adequately plead his \nallegations. Rec. Doc. 43 at 8-9. Prior to the issuance of that \nOrder  and  Reasons,  and  while  the  Parish’s  original  motion  to \ndismiss was under consideration, the above-listed defendants also \nfiled motions to dismiss. Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint \non January 28, 2016.  Following Plaintiff’s filing of the amended \ncomplaint,  the  Court  issued  an  Order  permitting  the  other \ndefendants  to  file  supplemental  memoranda,  if  necessary,  to \naddress  the  amended  complaint  in  the  context  of  their  pending \nmotions to dismiss.  \nPlaintiff’s amended complaint provides a few additional facts \npointing out the relationships between the named defendants and \nexplaining their roles in implementing Louisiana Revised Statute \n§ 18:562. See Rec. Doc. 50. However, Plaintiff failed to heed this \nCourt’s advice by identifying the factual underpinnings of the \nvaguely alleged conspiracy to deny him of his rights on account of \nhis race. See Rec. Doc. 50. In addition to the above-mentioned \nchanges, Plaintiff also added two defendants—the Tangipahoa Parish \nBoard  of  Election  Supervisors  and  Voting  Commissioner  Patricia \nHughes-Sims. Rec. Doc. 50 at 7. The Court will analyze all of the \npending motions to dismiss in light of this amended complaint. See \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 4 of 15\nKing  v.  Dogan,  31  F.3d  344,  346  (5th  Cir.  1994)  (“An  amended \ncomplaint supersedes the original complaint and renders it of no \nlegal effect unless the amended complaint specifically refers to \nand adopts or incorporates by reference the earlier pleading.”).  \nII.  LAW AND ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiff begins his amended complaint, as he did his original \ncomplaint,  by  listing  thirteen  federal  and  state  laws  and \nconstitutional provisions that he believes provide him causes of \naction and justify damages in the amount of $1,000,000,000.00. \nRec. Doc. 50 at 1, 10. He goes on to assert factual allegations \nregarding each defendant without clearly connecting them to the \ndifferent causes of action.2  \nThe  different  defendants  rely  on  numerous  grounds  for \ndismissing  the  claims  against  them.  However,  each  defendant \nprimarily relies upon Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nprocedure.3 Due to the number of defendants seeking dismissal and \nfor  simplicity’s  sake,  the  Court  will  walk  through  each  of \nPlaintiff’s alleged grounds for relief, discussing as needed how \n                     \n2 One defendant claims that the Court should not consider the amended \ncomplaint because it was filed two days after the Court-imposed deadline. \nRec. Doc. 54-1 at 3. However, as Plaintiff is a pro se litigant without \naccess to the electronic filing system, the Court will consider the amended \ncomplaint.   \n3 Five of the defendants also rely upon Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity \ngrounds to dismiss some or all of the claims against them. See Rec. Docs. 27, \n52. Five also rely on lack of subject matter jurisdiction over pendent state \nlaw claims after arguing for dismissal of all federal law claims. See Rec. \nDocs. 53 at 10; 57 at 12. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 5 of 15\neach ground applies generally, and then, if necessary, how each \napplies to the relevant defendants.  \na. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \na party can move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted. When reviewing a motion to \ndismiss, courts must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and \nview them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See \nBaker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). “To survive a \nmotion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter,  accepted  as  true,  to  state  a  claim  to  relief  that  is \nplausible on its face.” Gonzales v. Kay, 577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th \nCir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 1949 \n(2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). A claim is facially \nplausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is \nliable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  \nHowever, pro se complaints are “construed liberally,” Johnson \nv. Watkins, 999 F.2d 99, 100 (5th Cir. 1993), and they are “held \nto  less  stringent  standards  than  formal  pleadings  drafted  by \nlawyers.” Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th \nCir. 2002) (quoting Miller v. Stanmore, 636 F.2d 986, 987 (5th \nCir.  1981)).  Nevertheless,  “conclusory  allegations  or  legal \nconclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 6 of 15\nto  prevent  a  motion  to  dismiss.”  Id.  (quoting  S.  Christian \nLeadership Conference v. Supreme Court of Louisiana, 252 F.3d 781, \n786 (5th Cir. 2001)). \nb. Federal Law Claims \nThe initial paragraph of Duncan’s amended complaint generally \ninvokes several federal laws and constitutional provisions, which \nthe Court will use as a guide for navigating Plaintiff’s claims. \nRec. Doc. 50 at 1. \n1. 42 U.S.C. § 1915 \nSection 1915 of Title 42 is no longer part of the United \nStates Code. In all likelihood, Plaintiff meant to cite 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915, which addresses litigants proceeding in forma pauperis. \nNevertheless, that statute does not provide Plaintiff a right of \naction. Accordingly, any claims under either statute against the \nMovants are hereby dismissed. \n2. 42 U.S.C. § 19814  \nSection 1981 guarantees all persons in every State the rights \n“to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, \nand to the full and equal benefit of all laws.” “To establish a \nclaim under § 1981, a plaintiff must allege facts in support of \n                     \n4 The Court will not individually address Plaintiff’s claim under the Civil \nRights Act of 1866 because the substantive rights portion of that Act is now \ncodified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981-1982. Sanders v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 431 F.2d \n1097, 1098 (5th Cir. 1970). As Plaintiff explicitly invokes § 1981 and not § \n1982, this Court’s discussion of § 1981 proves sufficient to address \nPlaintiff’s claims under the 1866 Act.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 7 of 15\nthe following elements: (1) that the plaintiff is a member of a \nracial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of \nrace by the defendant; and (3) the discrimination concerns one or \nmore of the activities enumerated in the statute.” Green v. State \nBar  of  Texas,  27  F.3d  1083,  1086  (5th  Cir.  1994).  Here,  with \nrespect to all Movants, Plaintiff’s amended complaint does not \nmeet this burden.  \nPlaintiff meets the first element by alleging that he is an \nAfrican-American male. However, his complaint fails with respect \nto the second element. Duncan proclaims that the defendants engaged \nin a conspiracy to deprive him of the right to vote because of \n“his skin color, race and gender.” Rec. Doc. 50 at 2. He also \nclaims  that  the  defendants’  actions  constituted  “racial \nharassment.” Rec. Doc. 50 at 2. However, Plaintiff pleads no other \nfacts  to  support  these  conclusory  allegations.  Later,  Duncan \ncontradicts his original conclusion by suggesting uncertainty as \nto  the  reason  for  his  inability  to  vote:  “Whether  denial  of \nplaintiff’s right to vote was because of his race, age, skin-\ncolor,  gender,  ethnicity  or  whatever  god-forsaken  reason  is \nirrelevant.”5 Rec. Doc. 50 at 10. In fact, it is relevant, and \n                     \n5 One of Duncan’s oppositions also claims that “plaintiff knows only that he \nwas denied the right to vote . . . Voting Commissioner Patricia Hughes-Sims \nand the other defendant [sic] must provide their reason for denying plaintiff \nthe right to vote,” which further demonstrates Plaintiff’s failure to \nproperly plead intent to discriminate.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 8 of 15\nPlaintiff’s failure to support his conclusory allegations requires \ndismissal of all claims against the Movants under § 1981.  \n3. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985-1986 \n   Section  1985  provides  a  right  of  action  for  individuals \ninjured by a conspiracy to interfere with their civil rights. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1985. “Plaintiffs who assert conspiracy claims under civil \nrights statutes must plead the operative facts upon which their \nclaim is based. Bald allegations that a conspiracy existed are \ninsufficient.” Lynch v. Cannatella, 810 F.2d 1363, 1369-70 (5th \nCir.  1987).  This  Court  previously  afforded  Plaintiff  the \nopportunity to amend his complaint to plead sufficient facts to \nsupport a conspiracy claim. Rec. Doc. 43 Plaintiff filed an amended \ncomplaint but the additional allegations do not shed any light on \nthe alleged conspiracy.  \nThe only time Duncan gets close to elucidating his conspiracy \nclaim is in his oppositions where he claims that “Tangipahoa Parish \nRegistrar of Voters John Russell and Tangipahoa Parish Registrar \nof  Voters  Office  did  conspire  to  participate  in  meetings  and \ndiscussions and did participate in meetings and discussions in \nwhich  voter  identification  was  discussed  or  should  have  been \ndiscussed.” Rec. Docs. 41 at 6, 46-1 at 6. Even in these instances, \nhowever, Plaintiff does not allege facts supporting a claim that \ndefendants  conspired  to  violate  his  civil  rights.  Instead,  he \nalleges that two of the defendants conspired to hold a meeting at \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 9 of 15\nwhich  they  either  discussed  or  should  have  discussed  voter \nidentification policy. Accordingly, Plaintiffs conspiracy claims \nagainst all Movants must fail.   \nSection  1986  provides  for  third  party  liability  based  on \nknowledge of violations of section 1985. 42 U.S.C. § 1986.  As \nPlaintiff has failed to allege facts to support a claim under § \n1985, he has also necessarily failed to allege facts to support a \nclaim under § 1986.  \n4. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nSection 1983 establishes a private right of action for “any \nparty deprived of a constitutional right under color of state law.” \nTexas Manufactured Hous. Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Nederland, 101 \nF.3d 1095, 1106 (5th Cir. 1996). While section 1983 creates a \nremedy,  it  does  not  create  any  substantive  rights.  Rather, \nPlaintiff must demonstrate that (1) a person acting under color of \nstate  law  (2)  deprived  him  of  a  right  guaranteed  by  the \nConstitution or laws of the United States. American Mfrs. Mut. \nIns. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49-50. (1999). Furthermore, \nPlaintiff  must  support  his  claim  with  “specific  facts \ndemonstrating a constitutional deprivation and may not rely on \nconclusory allegations.” Brown v. Bd. of Trs. Sealy Indep. Sch. \nDist., 871 F. Supp. 2d 581, 596 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (citing Schuelta \nv. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir. 1995)). The constitutional \ndeprivation must also result from intentional conduct, not mere \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 10 of 15\nnegligence.  Id.  (citing  Farmer  v.  Brennan,  511  U.S.  825,  828 \n(1994).  \nDefendant  repeatedly  asserts  that  the  Defendants  in  this \nmatter were acting under color of state law, and it is clear from \nthe face of his complaint that he seeks relief for actions taken \nby defendants acting in their official capacities rather than as \nprivate citizens. See Rec. Doc. 50. Thus, the first element is \nmet. With respect to the second element, Plaintiff seemingly relies \non violations of the 14th and 15th Amendments as the bases for his \n§ 1983 claim. See Rec. Doc. 50 at 1. However, the Court need not \nreach those claims today because Plaintiff’s allegations do not \nmeet  the  intentional  conduct  requirement  with  respect  to  the \nMovants. The only intentional conduct by a state actor referenced \nin  the  complaint  is  voting  commissioner  Patricia  Hughes-Sims’s \nallegedly intentional decision to refuse plaintiff’s two forms of \nidentification because of his “skin-color and/or gender and race.”6 \nRec. Doc. 50 at 9. However, Hughes-Sims has no motion before this \nCourt  and  has  yet  to  file  an  answer.  Moreover,  the  factual \nallegations against the Movants all sound in negligence.7 See Rec. \n                     \n6 Again, Plaintiff’s amended complaint mentions a conspiracy, which qualifies \nas intentional conduct. Rec. Doc. 50 at 2. However, for the reasons discussed \nabove, that conspiracy claim is not adequately supported by the pleadings. \nSee supra section II.b.3.  \n7 Duncan implies that the State of Louisiana negligently hired Hughes-Sims. He \ninsinuates that the Secretary of State’s Office and Secretary of State Tom \nSchedler negligently trained others as they were responsible for providing \ntraining and training materials. He intimates that Tangipahoa Parish \nnegligently appointed Registrar of Voters John Russel who in turn negligently \nappointed a member of the Board of Election Supervisors who in turn \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 11 of 15\nDoc. 50 at 9. As such, Plaintiff fails to adequately make out a § \n1983 claim against any of the movants.  \n5. 42 U.S.C. § 1988 \nSection 1988 permits plaintiffs who prevail under §§ 1981, \n1983, 1985, or 1986 (among others statutes not cited by Plaintiff) \nto seek attorney’s fees. As discussed above, Plaintiff has not \nadequately plead any claims under those statutes, meaning he is \nnot entitled to relief under § 1988.  \n6. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 \nPlaintiff generally invokes the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”) of \n1965 without specifying an applicable provision. Nonetheless, it \nappears most likely that Plaintiff aims to rely upon section two \nof the VRA, which prohibits voting qualifications or prerequisites \nto  voting  as  well  as  standards,  practices,  or  procedures  that \nresult in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account \nof race or color. 52 U.S.C. § 10301. Here, as best this Court can \nsurmise,  Plaintiff  alleges  that  Louisiana  Revised  Statute  § \n18:562, which requires certain forms of picture identification or \na signed affidavit to vote, resulted in the denial of his right to \nvote  on  account  of  his  race.  A  plaintiff  may  demonstrate  a \n                     \nnegligently appointed Hughes-Sims. Finally, he implies that the Clerk of \nCourt’s Office negligently trained voting commissioners and that Clerk Julian \nDufreche negligently chaired the Board of Election Supervisors that appointed \nHughes-Sims. See Rec. Doc. 50 at 3-7. While saying that these allegations \nsound in negligence and thus cannot support a § 1983 claim, this Court is by \nno means addressing the sufficiency of any negligence claim against any of \nthe defendants.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 12 of 15\nviolation  of  section  two  of  the  VRA  by  proving  either  a \ndiscriminatory purpose or a discriminatory effect. Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 35 (1986). \nAs  discussed  in  more  detail  above,  Plaintiff  has  not \nadequately alleged any discriminatory intent by Movants. Instead, \nhis  claims  against  them  sound  in  negligence,  meaning  his  only \npossibility  for  success  here  is  under  a  discriminatory  effect \ntheory. “The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral \nlaw, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical \nconditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by \nblack and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.” \nId. at 47. Here, Duncan does not claim that the questioned law \ncreates unequal opportunities for black or other minority voters.8 \nRather, he claims that he was denied the right to vote on this one \noccasion, and he believes that it may be a result of his race. A \nsingle incident is insufficient to demonstrate the discriminatory \neffect of a state voting prerequisite. Thus, all claims against \nMovants brought under the VRA are dismissed with prejudice.  \nFor all of the reasons discussed throughout the proceeding \nsections, Plaintiff has not stated any federal claims upon which \n                     \n8 This same pleading deficiency defeats any claim Plaintiff may have under the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. Plaintiff also generally invokes that Act. This \nCourt’s best guess is that Plaintiff seeks to cite Title I of the Act, which \nprohibits race, color, or previous conditions from affecting one’s right to \nvote. 52 U.S.C. § 10101. As Plaintiff has not pointed to a pattern or \npractice of discrimination, no such claim can succeed here. See U.S. v. Lynd, \n349 F.2d 785, 786 (5th Cir. 1965).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 13 of 15\nrelief can be granted. All he has presented this Court with are \nconclusory allegations of racial discrimination with no factual \nfoundation. While leave to amend is typically given freely in these \nsituations, McClellon v. Lone Star Gas Co., 66 F.3d 98, 103 (5th \nCir. 1995), this Court already provided Plaintiff one opportunity \nto amend  his complaint. That resulted in an amended complaint \nwith  more  inadequate  support  for  the  deficient  claims.  Thus, \nproviding a second opportunity would prove to be a futile endeavor. \nAccordingly, all of Plaintiff’s claims under federal law against \nthe Movants are dismissed with prejudice.  \nc. State Law Claims \nWith all of Plaintiff’s federal law claims against the Movants \ndismissed, that leaves only states law claims over which this Court \ndoes not have original jurisdiction. Nevertheless, 28 U.S.C. § \n1367(a) provides for supplemental jurisdiction over pendent state \nlaw claims that are sufficiently related to claims over which the \nCourt has original jurisdiction. Yet, district courts may use their \ndiscretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over \nsuch  claims  if,  among  other  reasons,  the  state  law  claims \nsubstantially  predominate  over  the  claims  with  original \njurisdiction or the court has dismissed all claims over which it \nhas original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). Here, Plaintiffs \nremaining claims against Movants consist of state law negligence \nclaims as well as other vague claims regarding the implementation \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 14 of 15\nof Louisiana Revised Statute § 18:562 by state officials. Moreover, \nthe  crux  of  Plaintiff’s  complaint  appears  to  be  the  voter \nidentification procedures used generally by the State and those \napplied  to  him  in  this  one  instance.  These  claims  evidently \npredominate over any and all federal law claims pending against \nthe two remaining defendants. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s state law \nclaims against all Movants, to the extent that there are some \nremaining,  are  dismissed  without  prejudice  to  bring  in  state \ncourt.9  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nIn light of the foregoing, \n  IT IS ORDERED that the Parish’s motion to dismiss (Rec. Doc. \n54) is GRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the State Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Rec. Doc. 53) is GRANTED and their \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) (Rec. Doc. 52) is DISMISSED \nAS MOOT. \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Registrar Defendants’ motion \nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Rec. Doc. 28) is GRANTED and their \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) (Rec. Doc. 27) is DISMISSED \nAS MOOT.   \n                     \n9 As all claims have been resolved, the Court need not reach the sovereign \nimmunity issue raised by several defendants. \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 67   Filed 04/13/16   Page 15 of 15\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of Court Defendants’ \nmotion (Rec. Doc. 29) is GRANTED in part and DISMISSED AS MOOT in \npart. The motion is granted in all parts except for the motion to \nstrike, which is now moot. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 13th day of April, 2016.  \n \n \n____________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n   \n \n15 \n ",

Indeed, they are sued only in their official capacity. \n6. \nA very narrow exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Ex Parle Young doctrine \nexists.  However, this narrow exception does not apply in this case because the Plaintiff cannot \nmeet the requirements of the exception. \n7. \nAs  it relates  to  the  named Registrar Defendants, the PlaintitI fails  to  show that these \nDefendants have the requisite connection with the enforcement of the act challenged necessary to \nestablish the Ex Parte Young Exception. \n2 Cozzo v.

MAG. JUDGE: 1- SHUSHAN \n****************************************************************************** \nMOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO\n \nFED. R. CIV. P 12(b)(6)\n \nNOW  INTO COURT, through  undersigned  counsel, come the  Defendants Tangipahoa \nParish Registrar of Voters Office and John Russell in his official capacity as Tangipahoa Parish \nRegistrar  of Voters,  (collectively  \"Registrar  Defendants\")  who  move  this  Honorable  COUIt, \npursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b)(6), to dismiss the above-entitled action on the ground that, as \ndemonstrated by the following, it fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \nI. \nRule  12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure permits a motion to  dismiss for \nfailure of the complaint to state a claim on which relief can be granted. \n2. \nWhile a complaint need  not have detailed factual  allegations, a plaintiff does have the \nobligation to provide the grounds for his entitlement to relief.  Bell Atlanfic Corp.  v.  Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544,127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007). \n3. \nThe complaint must contain enough factual material to let the court draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable based on the misconduct alleged.  Jd. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 28   Filed 12/27/15   Page 2 of 3\n4. \n\nThe plaintiff must plead enough facts  to  state a claim for relief that is plausible on its \nface.  Id.  at 570.  \"Factual  allegations  must be  enough  to  raise  a right  to  relief above  the \nspeculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if \ndoubtful in fact) ....\"  Id.  at 1965. \n5. \nConclusory allegations and  unwarranted factual  deductions will  not suffice to  avoid  a \nmotion to dismiss.  United States ex ref.  Willard v.  Humana Health Plan afTexas, Inc., 336 F.3d \n375,379 (5th Cir. 2003). \n6. \nTherefore, assuming all of the facts raised in Plaintiffs Complaint are true, the complaint \nfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted as to the Registrar Defendants, all of which \nis more fuBy shown by the memorandum attached to this motion and incorporated by reference. \n2ih \nRespectfully submitted this  day of December, 2015. \nJAMES \"BUDDY\" D.

There are multiple reasons why plaintiff’s complaint should \nbe dismissed.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 29   Filed 12/29/15   Page 2 of 3\n  First, neither the Tangipahoa Clerk of Court, nor Julian Dufreche, are vicariously \nliable  for  alleged  violations  of  Mr.  Duncan’s  civil  rights  by  an  unidentified  polling \ncommissioner in Tangipahoa Parish.  Second, there are no allegations that what happened \nallegedly happened to Mr. Duncan resulted from a custom or policy of the Tangipahoa Clerk \nof Court.  Third, there are no allegations that Dufreche was involved individually in what \ntranspired  at  the  polling  location  in  Tangipahoa  Parish  on  October  25,  2015  or  that \nDufreche acted with deliberate indifference to violations of Mr. Duncan’s constitutional \nrights by one of Dufreche’s subordinates.  Fifth, Mr. Duncan has asserted claims under \nvarious federal statutes which have no application to the matter at hand and which do not \nentitle him to relief in this case.  Sixth, there are insufficient factual allegations to support \nMr. Duncan’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims. \n  Dufreche also moves the court pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(f) to strike allegations against \nDufreche in his official capacity, as those claims are immaterial, impertinent, redundant \nand duplicative of the claims against the Tangipahoa Clerk of Court.  \n  Further, the allegations regarding punitive damages against the Tangipahoa Clerk of \nCourt and Dufreche, in his official capacity, are impertinent since punitive damages are not \nallowed against such parties.  Those claims should, thus, also be struck pursuant to F.R.C.P. \n12(f). \n  Finally, since the plaintiff’s complaint fails to state claims upon which relief can be \ngranted under any federal laws or constitutional provisions, the state law claims under La. \nR.S. 18:562, La. Civ. Code Art 2315 and La. Civ. Code Article 2317 should be dismissed for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  \n \nPage 2 of 3 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 29   Filed 12/29/15   Page 3 of 3\n \nHUVAL VEAZEY FELDER & RENEGAR, LLC \n \n                                                                        /S/ THOMAS H.

AL.     JUDGE IVAN L.R. LEMELLE \n \n****************************************************************************** \n \nMOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(b)(1) and RULE 12(b)(6) \n \nMAY IT PLEASE THE COURT: \n  NOW  INTO  COURT,  through  undersigned  counsel,  come  the  Defendants,  the \nTangipahoa  Parish  Board  of  Election  Supervisors  and  Patricia  Hughes,  in  her  capacity  as \nCommissioner for the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors, who respectfully move \nthis Honorable Court to dismiss this complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) for the reasons explained below. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \n1.   \n  A case will be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) if the court lacks the statutory \nauthority to hear and decide the dispute.1   \n2.   \nThe  Defendant  respectfully  states  that  accepting  all  factual  allegations  made  by  the \nPlaintiff as true, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide Plaintiff’s claims \nwith respect to the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors. \n3.   \n  The Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors is a political subdivision of the \n                                            \n1 St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 58 S.Ct. 586 (1938). \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 68   Filed 05/02/16   Page 2 of 5\nState of Louisiana, created under state statute in La. R.S. 18:423.  Commissioner Patricia Hughes \nis  an  employee  of  the  Tangipahoa  Parish  Board  of  Election  Supervisors  for  purposes  of \nconducting elections in accordance with La. R.S. 18:425 and La. R.S. 18:434. \n4.   \n  Suit against a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana is improper in federal court \nunder La. R.S. 13:5106(A).   \n5.   \nThe Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution provides as follows: \nThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any \nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against of the United States by \nCitizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.  \nU.S. Const. amend. XI. \n6.   \n  Eleventh Amendment immunity is applicable to the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election \nSupervisors as a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana and to and Patricia Hughes, in her \ncapacity as Commissioner for the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors, and the \nEleventh Amendment bars a state’s citizens from filing suit against the State in federal court \nunless it has waived its immunity.2   \n7.   \n  Plaintiff’s Complaint is absent any sufficient allegations of unlawful conduct as to the \nTangipahoa  Parish  Board  of  Election  Supervisors  or  Patricia  Hughes,  in  her  capacity  as \nCommissioner for the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors.  \n \n                                            \n2 Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council-President Government, 279 F. 3d 273, 280 (5th Cir. 2002). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 68   Filed 05/02/16   Page 3 of 5\n8.   \n  A very narrow exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Ex Parte Young doctrine \nexists.  However, this narrow exception does not apply in this case because the Plaintiff cannot \nmeet the requirements of the exception.   \n9.   \n  Further, it is well-established law within the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit that the State has not waived its immunity from suit in federal court.3   \n10.   \n  The Louisiana Legislature, through La. R.S. 13:5106(A), clearly expresses that “no suit \nagainst the state shall be instituted in any court other than a Louisiana state court.” \n11.   \nBecause the State has not waived its sovereign immunity, this Court lacks jurisdiction to \nentertain his claims against the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election Supervisors or Patricia \nHughes,  in  her  capacity  as  commissioner  for  the  Tangipahoa  Parish  Board  of  Election \nSupervisors and, accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed as to the Tangipahoa Parish \nBoard of Election Supervisors pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \n12.   \n  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

SECTION \"B\"(1) \n \n \nORDER AND REASONS \n \nBefore the Court are two motions filed by pro se plaintiff \nJohnny Duncan (hereinafter “Duncan” or “Plaintiff”). The first is \n“Plaintiff’s Fed. R. Civ. Procedure, Rule 11 Motion for Sanctions \nAgainst  Defendants  Tangipahoa  Parish  Registrar  of  Voters  John \nRussell and Tangipahoa Parish Registrar of Voters.” Rec. Doc. No. \n39. The second is “Plaintiff’s Motion for Recusal of Judge Ivan \nLemelle, Pursuant [to] 28 U.S.C. §455(a).” Rec. Doc. No. 40. For \nthe reasons outlined below,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the motions are DENIED.  \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nDuncan filed the instant lawsuit as a result of the alleged \ndenial of his right to vote in a Louisiana primary election in \nOctober of 2015. The litigation is only in its infancy. However, \nPlaintiff seeks sanctions on two opposing parties as well as the \nundersigned’s recusal due to the following sequence of events. On \nDecember 16, 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion for entry of default \nas well as a motion for default judgment against the Tangipahoa \nParish Registrar of Voters, John Russell, as well as the Tangipahoa \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 2 of 7\nParish  Registrar  of  Voters  Office  (hereinafter  collectively \nreferred to as “Defendants”). Rec. Docs. 24, 25. As Defendants \nfailed to timely file responsive pleadings, Duncan sought an entry \nof  default  and  then  a  default  judgment  for  one-quarter  of \n$1,000,000,000.00. The following day, Defendants filed a motion to \nenroll counsel as well as a motion for extension of time to answer. \nRec. Docs. 21-22.  \nThereafter, this Court issued an Order addressing all four of \nthe pending motions. The Court denied both of Plaintiff’s motions \nconcerning default and granted both of Defendants’ motions. As \nthis Court explained in that Order, the Defendants’ subsequent \nappearance demonstrating an intent to defend rendered the motions \nfor default futile. Accordingly, the Court denied the motions and \ngranted Defendants an extension of time to plead pursuant to Local \nRule 7.8. Plaintiff has taken issue with that result. \nOn January 6, 2016, Duncan filed objections to the Court’s \nOrder in which he accused the Court of failing to provide good \ncause for its decision and, in addition, accused the Court of \ncommitting plain error and abusing its discretion by opting to \ndecide this case on the merits. Rec. Doc. 37 at 2-3. That same \nday, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for sanctions based on the \nDefendants’ alleged failure to properly serve him with the motion \nto enroll and the motion for extension of time within which to \nplead. Next, Plaintiff filed the motion for recusal based upon the \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 3 of 7\nCourt’s decision not to grant his motions for default. He alleges—\nwithout any support for his accusations—that this Court’s decision \nwas  based  on  discriminatory  intent.  Namely,  that  this  Court \ndiscriminated against him because of his race and/or his status as \na pro se litigant. Additionally, Plaintiff claims—also without any \nsupport—that this Court’s decision resulted from improper ex parte \ncommunications with the Attorney General.  \nII.  LAW AND ANALYSIS  \nThe Court will first address Duncan’s motion for recusal, \nrecognizing a need to resolve this issue before deciding the fate \nof any additional motions. \na. Motion for Recusal  \nDuncan urges the undersigned to recuse himself pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C.  §  455.  Section  455  provides:  “Any  justice,  judge,  or \nmagistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in \nany  proceeding  in  which  his  impartiality  might  reasonably  be \nquestioned.” Id. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit described this as an objective test, stating that a judge \n“should disqualify himself ‘if the reasonable man, were he to know \nall  the  circumstances,  would  harbor  doubts  about  the  judge’s \nimpartiality.’” IQ Products Co. v. Pennzoil Products Co., 305 F.3d \n368, 379 (5th Cir. 2002) (quoting Potashnick v. Port City Constr. \nCo., 609 F.2d 1101, 1111 (5th Cir. 1980)).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 4 of 7\nThe primary basis for the alleged impartiality is this Court’s \ndecision to refuse entry of default judgment. Plaintiff’s filings \ndemonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of this Court’s prior \nOrder as well as the purpose behind default judgments. Rather than \ntake the time to familiarize himself with the applicable Federal \nRules  of  Civil  Procedure  and  the  relevant  jurisprudence \ninterpreting those rules, Duncan has decided to rely only upon his \nown strict interpretation. \nHowever,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has instructed  that  “[d]efault \njudgments are a drastic remedy, not favored by the Federal Rules \nand resorted to by courts only in extreme situations.” Sun Bank of \nOcala v. Pelican Homestead and Sav. Ass’n, 874 F.2d 274, 276 (5th \nCir. 1989).  Further, the Fifth Circuit has stated that “[a] party \nis not entitled to a default judgment as a matter of right, even \nwhere the defendant is technically in default.” Ganther v. Ingle, \n75 F.3d 207, 212 (5th Cir. 1996). “Generally, the entry of default \njudgment is committed to the discretion of the district judge.” \nMason v. Lister, 562 F.2d 343, 345 (5th Cir. 1977) (citing Wright \n& Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2685). As made clear in \nthe Order denying entry of default and default judgment,1 “the \ncourt may consider whether it later would be obliged to set aside \n                     \n1 In its reasons for denying the entry of default, this Court stated that \n“entering default in this case would prove to be a waste of time as the entry \nof default would inevitably be set aside due to the Defendant’s recent \nappearance.” Rec. Doc. 26 at 2.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 5 of 7\nthe default on defendant’s motion, since it would be meaningless \nto enter the judgment as a matter of course if that decision meant \nthat  the  court  immediately  would  be  required  to  take  up  the \nquestion of whether it should be set aside.” Wright & Miller, \nFederal  Practice  and  Procedure  §  2685.  This  Court,  like  many \nothers, “make[s] every effort to decide a case on its merits rather \nthan rule on a technicality,” and the earlier decision to follow \nthis  principle  was  not  in  error  as  Plaintiff  alleges.  JMC \nConstruction  LP  v.  Modular  Space  Corp.,  No.  07-1925,  2008  WL \n4531819, at *1 (Oct. 8, 2008 N.D. Tex.).  \nBeyond that, Duncan makes the assumption that, because his \nmotions  were  denied,  the  undersigned  must  have  some  ulterior \nmotive. Accordingly, Plaintiff concludes that the undersigned must \nbe  discriminating  against  him  and/or  holding  ex  parte \ncommunications  with  opposing  counsel.  Both  assertions  are \nunfounded.  Consequently,  no  reasonable  person,  knowing  and \nunderstanding  all  of  these  circumstances,  could  harbor  doubts \nconcerning the partiality of the undersigned. Plaintiff has simply \nwasted this Court’s time and resources with unsubstantiated and \nfictitious allegations of impropriety. The motion for recusal is \ntherefore denied.  \nb.  Motion for Sanctions \nPlaintiff urges this Court to sanction Defendants for their \nalleged failure “to abide by local and federal rules and provide \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 6 of 7\nplaintiff with a copy of their motions to enroll and for time \nextension.” Rec. Doc. 39 at 2. Plaintiff claims that the defendants \nviolated Rule 5(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nbecause  he  never  received  a  copy  of  the  motions  from  the \ndefendants. Rec. Doc. 39 at 2. In addition to “any other sanctions \nthat the Court may deem appropriate,” Plaintiff would like the \nCourt to deny Defendants’ pending motions to dismiss. Rec. Doc. 39 \nat 2.  \nDefendants’  Certificates  of  Service  accompanying  their \nmotions certified that, upon filing, they would provide copies of \nthe motions to Plaintiff via U.S. Mail as Plaintiff is not a CM/ECF \nparticipant. Rec. Docs. 21 at 2; 22 at 2. Rule 5(b)(2)(C) permits \nthis method of service, stating: “A paper is served under this \nrule by . . . mailing it to the person’s last known address-in \nwhich  event  service  is  complete  upon  mailing.  FED.  R.  CIV.  P. \n5(b)(2)(C)  (emphasis  added).  Importantly,  Plaintiff  bases  his \nclaim on the allegation that he never received the motions. He \ndoes not contend that Defendants never mailed them, and the Court \nhas no reason to believe that Defendants did not serve them as \nthey  certified  in  their  motions.  Receipt  is  not  the  relevant \nquestion for determining proper service, whether they were mailed \nis the important inquiry. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion does not \nplead facts to support the allegation of improper service.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 49   Filed 01/27/16   Page 7 of 7\nMoreover, Plaintiff invokes Rule 11 without identifying which \nportion of Rule 11 warrants sanctions. A motion for sanctions “must \ndescribe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b).” \nFED.  R.  CIV.  P.  11(c)(2).  Rule  11(b)  identifies  certain \nrepresentations  that  attorneys  make  when  they  present  written \nmotions to the Court—none of which address service. FED. R. CIV. P. \n11(b).  Plaintiff  has  therefore not  identified  specific  conduct \nthat could be construed as a violation of Rule 11(b). Finally, the \nrequested relief—dismissal of unrelated pending motions—is not an \nappropriate sanction under Rule 11. See FED. R. CIV. P. 11(c)(4) \n(“A  sanction  imposed  under  this  rule  must  be  limited  to  what \nsuffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct \nby others similarly situated.”).  \nFor the reasons discussed above, \n  IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff’s motions are DENIED.  \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 27th day of January, 2016.  \n \n \n____________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n7 \n ",

SECTION “B”(1)  \n \nORDER AND REASONS \n \n  Before the Court is the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Election \nSupervisors and Patricia Hughes’ “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6).” Rec. Doc. 68. The instant motion \nwas set for submission on May 25, 2016. Pursuant to Local Rule \n7.5, Plaintiff’s memorandum in opposition was due on or before May \n17, 2016. No memoranda in opposition have been filed. Further, no \nparty filed a motion to continue the noticed submission date or a \nmotion for extension of time within which to oppose the motion. \nWhile pro se litigants are provided greater leniency in certain \nareas, they are still obligated like represented parties to comply \nwith all court orders, rules, and deadlines. Thus, the motion is \ndeemed to be unopposed. It further appearing to the Court that the \nmotion has merit, \n  IT IS ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED. All of Plaintiff’s \nclaims against the two remaining Defendants in this matter, the \nTangipahoa  Parish  Board  of  Election  Supervisors  and  Patricia \nHughes, are hereby DISMISSED.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 70   Filed 05/26/16   Page 2 of 2\nA  motion  for  reconsideration  of  this  Order  based  on  the \nappropriate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, if any, must be filed \nwithin  thirty  (30)  days  of  this  Order.  The  motion  must  be \naccompanied  by  opposition  memoranda  to  the  original  motion.  \nBecause such a motion would not have been necessary had timely \nopposition memoranda been filed, the costs incurred in connection \nwith the motion, including attorney's fees, may be assessed against \nthe party moving for reconsideration. See FED. R. CIV. P. 16, 83.  \nA statement of costs and fees conforming to Local Rules 54.2 and \n54.3 shall be submitted by all parties desiring to be awarded costs \nand attorney's fees no later than eight (8) days prior to the \nnoticed submission date of the motion for reconsideration. \n  New Orleans, Louisiana, this 26th day of May, 2016. \n  \n   \n                                       \n____________________________ \n                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n2 \n ",

SECTION \"B\"(1) \n \n \nORDER AND REASONS \n \nBefore  the  Court  is  Defendant  Tangipahoa  Parish’s \n(hereinafter “Defendant” or “the Parish”) motion to dismiss the \ncomplaint against it for failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncan  be  granted.  (Rec.  Doc.  No.  9).  Plaintiff,  Johnny  Duncan \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Duncan”), representing himself pro \nse, timely filed an opposition to the motion. For the reasons set \nforth below, \nIT IS ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED \nin part.   \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis  case  centers  upon  the  fundamental  right  to  vote. \nPlaintiff alleges that a polling employee of the Tangipahoa Parish \nClerk of Court and Clerk Julian DuFreche denied him the right to \nvote in the primary election occurring on October 24, 2015. (Rec. \nDoc. No. 1 at 8).  This despite the fact that he presented two \nforms of government-issued identification, including a “picture \nidentification.” (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 8). In total, Duncan asserts \nclaims against eight (8) separate defendants for their alleged \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 2 of 9\nroles in the denial of his voting rights. He seeks $1,000,000,000 \nin  punitive  and  actual  damages  plus  a  court  order  requiring \nLouisiana’s Registrars to issue photo identification cards to all \nregistered voters for use in federal, state, and local elections. \n(Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 4-7, 11). Relevant for the purposes of deciding \nthis motion are Duncan’s claims against the Parish,1 the Registrar \nof Voters Office, and the Registrar of Voters, John Russell.  \nAmong  other  things,  Duncan  asserts  that  the  Registrar  of \nVoters  is  tasked  with  providing  registered  voters  with  an \nidentification card that satisfies the requirements for voting in \nstate and federal elections. (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 6-7). He further \nalleges that no such photo identification card was issued to him \nby the Registrar’s Office. (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 6). As a result, \nDuncan was forced to present other forms of identification that \nwere  allegedly  deemed  unacceptable  by  polling  employees.  (Rec. \nDoc. No. 1 at 8). Additionally, Duncan claims that the Parish \n“anointed”  the  Registrar,  that  the  Parish  “controls  the  purse \nstrings” for the Registrar’s Office, and that the Parish “failed \nto provide the [Registrar] with the resources and oversight to \ninsure that it issued a voter identification card that complied \nwith [La. R.S. § 18:562].” (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 5). In essence, \nDuncan’s primary claim against the Parish is that it failed to \n                     \n1 In the Plaintiff’s complaint, the Parish is improperly referred to as the \n“Tangipahoa Parish Counsel.” \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 3 of 9\nprovide the necessary oversight and funding for its “employee,” \nthe Registrar, to issue the required photo identification cards to \nall  registered  voters.  Finally,  his  complaint  and  opposition \nvaguely refer to a conspiracy by Louisiana’s governmental entities \nto prevent him from voting. (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 2; Rec. Doc No. 12 \nat 8). \nThe Parish has moved to dismiss the claims against it pursuant \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Rec. Doc. \nNo. 9). Generally, the movant contends that “[c]laims against the \nParish  should  be  dismissed  because  parish  governments  do  not \nconduct elections.” (Rec. Doc. No. 9-1 at 1). While the motion to \ndismiss briefly discusses the governmental entities responsible \nfor certain aspects of elections, it neglects Plaintiff’s primary \nargument:  that  the  Parish  failed  to  provide  the  resources  and \noversight necessary to ensure that adequate identification cards \nwere issued to voters. Instead, the Parish asserts without support \nthat it “has no authority to supervise the Registrar after initial \nappointment.” (Rec. Doc. No. 9-1 at 3 note 1). Additionally, while \nignoring the obvious crux of Plaintiff’s claims against it, the \nParish asserts that Plaintiff did not allege that “he was denied \nthe  right  to  vote  in  the  October  24  election  due  to  lack  of \nfunding.” (Rec. Doc. No. 9-1 at 2). The Parish also completely \nignores the Plaintiff’s conspiracy claim, instead asserting that \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 4 of 9\n“Plaintiff has sued the Parish by mistake.” (Rec. Doc. No. 9-1 at \n3).  \nII.  LAW AND ANALYSIS  \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \na party can move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted. Such motions are viewed \nwith disfavor and rarely granted. Lowrey v. Tex. A & M Univ. Sys., \n117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. \nSales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 677 F.2d 1045, 1050 (5th \nCir. 1982)). When reviewing a motion to dismiss, courts must accept \nall well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party. See Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d \n190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996).  \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.” Gonzales v. Kay, 577 F.3d \n600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678, 1949 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). A claim is \nfacially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. \nat  678.  However,  pro  se  complaints  are  “construed  liberally,” \nJohnson v. Watkins, 999 F.2d 99, 100 (5th Cir. 1993), and they are \n“held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 5 of 9\nlawyers.” Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th \nCir. 2002) (quoting Miller v. Stanmore, 636 F.2d 986, 987 (5th \nCir.  1981)).  Nevertheless,  “conclusory  allegations  or  legal \nconclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice \nto  prevent  a  motion  to  dismiss.”  Id.  (quoting  S.  Christian \nLeadership Conference v. Supreme Court of Louisiana, 252 F.3d 781, \n786 (5th Cir. 2001)). \na. Plaintiff’s Voter Identification Card Claim \nDuncan has not cited, and we do not find, relevant authority \nrequiring the Registrar of Voters to issue photo identification \ncards  to  all  registered  voters  for  use  in  federal  and  state \nelections. Louisiana’s election laws contain a few references to \n“voter identification cards,” such as the requirement that the \nregistrar “mail a new voter identification card to the voter” after \naddress changes are made in the registration system. LA. STAT. ANN. \n§ 18:192(A)(1)(b). That same statute also requires the “parish \ngoverning authority” to “provide to the registrar of voters the \nfunding necessary for the mailing of new voter identification cards \nin the conduct of [a] canvass.” LA. STAT. ANN. § 18:192(B). However, \nthere is no mandate that the voter identification cards contain \nphotographs of voters.  \nAdditionally, the statute covering “prerequisites to voting” \nlists the forms of identification that voters may use to identify \nthemselves,  and  it  does  not  include  any  reference  to  voter \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 6 of 9\nidentification cards issued by the registrar, further indicating \nthat  no  such  requirement  exists.  LA. STAT. ANN.  §  18:562(A)(2). \nSection 18:562 also does not require a photo identification card \nto vote. Importantly, an individual who does not have the type of \nidentification listed in the statute would still be entitled to \nvote  by  signing  an  affidavit  to  that  effect.  LA.  STAT.  ANN.  § \n18:562(A)(2). Thus, there is no reason that the Registrar would \nneed to provide photo identification cards to registered voters \nbecause photo identification is not an absolute requirement for \nvoting.  \nIn fact, Plaintiff seems to concede that this requirement \ndoes not currently exist by asking this Court to issue such a \nmandate in his prayer for relief. (Rec. Doc. No. 1 at 11). While \nthis Court can understand Plaintiff’s motivation, the question of \nwhether or not such a requirement should exist is a political one. \nIf  Plaintiff  truly  desires  that  this  duty  be  imposed  upon \nLouisiana’s Registrars, then he must seek such relief through the \npolitical process.  \nDespite  the  overall  inadequacy  of  the  Parish’s  motion  to \ndismiss  and  memorandum  in  support,  this  Court  cannot  permit \nPlaintiff to maintain this claim because the duty he claims the \nParish breached does not actually exist. The primary issues in \nthis litigation are what did and did not occur at Plaintiff’s \npolling place on the day in question, not why the State failed to \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 7 of 9\nprovide  photo  identification  to  Plaintiff.  Plaintiff  does  not \nspecifically allege that the Parish played any role in the alleged \nrejections of Plaintiff’s identification on election day. Rather, \nhe alleges in conclusory fashion a vast conspiracy involving the \nParish and others.  \nb. Plaintiff’s Conspiracy Claim \n“The elements of civil conspiracy [under § 1983] are (1) an \nactual violation of a right protected under § 1983 and (2) actions \ntaken in concert by the defendants with the specific intent to \nviolate the aforementioned right.” Kerr v. Lyford, 171 F.3d 330, \n340 (5th Cir. 1999), abrogated on other grounds by Castellano v. \nFragozo,  352  F.3d  939  (5th  Cir.  2003).  To  defeat  a  motion  to \ndismiss, Plaintiff’s complaint only need plead facts that, taken \nas true, satisfy each element.  \nHere, Plaintiff’s complaint only references a conspiracy in \nthe most general terms, claiming that the basis for his claim is \na “conspiracy to deprive African American male plaintiff of the \nRight  to  vote.”  (Rec.  Doc.  No.  1  at  1).  His  memorandum  in \nopposition to the present motion then devotes two paragraphs to \nthe alleged conspiracy without detailing any factual allegations. \n(Rec. Doc. No. 12 at 7-8). In particular, Plaintiff fails to meet \nthe second element of the standard by not providing allegations of \nspecific actions taken by the defendants with the specific intent \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 8 of 9\nto deny him the right to vote. Plaintiff only provides this Court \nwith legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations.  \nNevertheless,  “court[s]  should  freely  give  a  complainant, \nespecially  a  pro  se  complainant,  leave  to  amend  defective \nallegations in a pleading.” McClellon v. Lone Star Gas Co., 66 \nF.3d  98,  103  (5th  Cir.  1995).  The  appropriate  remedy  in  this \nsituation is to “grant the pro se litigant an opportunity to amend \nthe complaint before it is dismissed.” Shiell v. Rowan, 2015 WL \n750705, No. 14-214, at *7 (E.D. La. Feb. 20, 2015) (citing Brewster \nv. Dretke, 587 F.3d 764, 767-78 (5th Cir. 2009)). In this case, \nPlaintiff could potentially amend his complaint in two ways: (1) \nto sufficiently plead a § 1983 civil conspiracy claim; and/or (2) \nto specifically plead facts demonstrating that the Parish played \na role in the rejection of his two forms of identification (and \nthe refusal to permit him to utilize the affidavit option) at the \npolling location.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nIn light of the foregoing, \n  IT IS ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED \nin part. Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendant based upon the \nRegistrar’s failure to provide a photo identification card for use \nin state and federal elections are DISMISSED. However, with respect \nto all other claims raised by Plaintiff, the motion to dismiss is \nDENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to reurge. \n\nCase 2:15-cv-05486-ILRL-SS   Document 43   Filed 01/12/16   Page 9 of 9\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff is granted leave to file \nan  amended  complaint  in  accordance  with  the  discussion  above. \nPlaintiff shall file the amended complaint no later than fourteen \n(14) days after the date of this order. FAILURE TO TIMELY AND \nEFFECTIVELY COMPLY WITH THIS ORDER WILL RESULT IN FINAL DISMISSAL \nWITHOUT NEED OF FURTHER NOTICE.  \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 11th day of January, 2016.  \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n ",
