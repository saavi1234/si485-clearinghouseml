    "summary": "<p>On March 23, 2023, the governor of Idaho signed into law SB 1100, which effectively banned transgender students attending Idaho public schools from using the bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. Specifically, SB 1100 prohibits Idaho public schools from permitting transgender students from using their preferred restroom and locker room, or else risk facing lawsuits from parents whose children share a bathroom or locker room with a transgender student. The law was set to go into effect on July 1, 2023, before the start of the 2023-24 school year.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the passage of SB 1100, a twelve-year-old transgender girl attending public school in Boise School District, along with her parents and the Sexuality and Gender Alliance (SAGA)&mdash;a student organization at Boise High School dedicated to ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students&mdash;filed this lawsuit on July 6, 2023. Represented by Lambda Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund and private counsel, they filed their lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho against the Idaho State Superintendent of Public Instruction, individual members of the Idaho State Board of Education, the Independent School District of Boise City, and the individual members of the school district&rsquo;s board. The plaintiffs alleged that SB 1100 violates Title IX and the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against transgender students based on their gender identity and forcing the involuntary disclosure of transgender students&rsquo; identity in violation of their due process right to privacy. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing SB 1100, and nominal damages of $1 along with attorneys&rsquo; fees. This case was assigned to District Judge David C. Nye.</p>\r\n<p>Contemporaneously with their complaint, plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin defendants from enforcing SB 1100 while the case proceeded. Plaintiffs specifically argued that their equal protection claim was likely to succeed because it triggered heightened scrutiny &nbsp;by the court. Under heightened scrutiny analysis, plaintiffs argued that SB 1100 is not substantially related to Idaho&rsquo;s purported interest in protecting all students&rsquo; privacy and safety. Plaintiffs further argued that allowing defendants to enforce SB 1100 as the 2023-24 school year began would irreparably harm transgender students by violating their constitutional rights, subjecting them to profound stigma, increasing their risk of depression, anxiety, and self-harm, interfering with treatment for gender dysphoria, and causing irreversible privacy violations that expose them to danger.</p>\r\n<p>The court set a hearing date of September 13, 2023 for plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, which was almost a month after the start of the school year. In response, plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order on July 28, 2023. Relying on the same argumentation as their motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs asked that the court temporarily enjoin defendants from enforcing SB 1100 until such time as the court ruled on their motion for preliminary injunction. The court granted plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for temporary restraining order on August 10, 2023, finding that issuing the temporary restraining order would &ldquo;preserve the status quo&rdquo; pending the court&rsquo;s decision on the preliminary injunction. 2023 WL 5146182.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 2023, the United States Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest, indicating the DOJ&rsquo;s view that the court should grant plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss on August 22, 2023. Defendants agreed that plaintiffs&rsquo; challenge to SB 1100 warranted heightened scrutiny by the court. However, citing to <a href=\"../../../../case/43948/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County</em></a>, in which the en banc Eleventh Circuit upheld a similar bathroom access law in Florida, they argued that plaintiffs&rsquo; equal protections and Title IX claims fail because sex-segregated restrooms have long been permissible under Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment to protect safety and privacy interests. Defendants further argued that any harm SB 1100 might cause to transgender students was remedied by gender-neutral, single-occupancy restrooms.</p>\r\n<p>Following oral argument on September 13, 2023, the district court denied both defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss and plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction on October 12, 2023. 2023 WL 6690596. The district court first acknowledged that there was an existing circuit split on how the equal protection clause and Title IX apply to bathroom laws like SB 1100. Although the Eleventh Circuit in Adams upheld such a law, challenges to similar bathroom laws have succeeded in the Fourth and Seventh Circuits. <em>See <a href=\"../../../../case/14977/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/15438/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whitaker by Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District</a>,</em> and <em><a href=\"../../../../case/43310/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A.C. by M.C. v. Metro School District of Martinsville</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p>Adding to the split among courts on this issue, the district court here denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, finding plaintiffs unlikely to succeed on their equal protection, Title IX, or due process privacy claims. Regarding the equal protections claim, applying heightened scrutiny, the court specifically found that SB 1100 classifies students based on sex as opposed to gender identity, and as such, SB 1100 treats students of all sexes equally by mandating that all students use the bathroom corresponding to their biological sex. The court further found that SB 1100 was substantially related to the government&rsquo;s legitimate state interest in protecting students&rsquo; privacy. Regarding plaintiffs&rsquo; Title IX claim, the court found <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17313/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton County</a></em>&mdash;in which the United States Supreme Court held that discrimination based on gender identity was necessarily discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII&mdash;to be of limited guidance in this case, since Bostock pertains to Title VII and not Title IX. The court found it dispositive for plaintiffs&rsquo; Title IX claim that Title IX explicitly allows sex segregation in the context of bathrooms and locker rooms. Finally, regarding plaintiffs&rsquo; due process claim that SB 1100 violated their privacy rights, the court found that plaintiffs&rsquo; claim was unlikely to succeed because although gender identity is in fact personal and private, that does not mean that disclosure of identity is a violation of due process privacy rights, and there is little to no case law one way or another. 2023 WL 6690596.</p>\r\n<p>Although the district court denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, the court also denied defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court indicated that defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss was perfunctory and lacked clear explanation, largely resting on the idea that plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were based on speculative science. The court declined to examine the science behind the parties&rsquo; positions without further discovery, and allowed plaintiffs to continue their claims against defendants, without the preliminary injunction in place. To allow time for Idaho public schools to adjust their policies and communicate with students and parents, the judge ruled that SB 1100 would go into effect on November 2, 2023. 2023 WL 6690596.</p>\r\n<p>Following the district court&rsquo;s decision, on October 16, 2023, plaintiffs appealed the court&rsquo;s denial of preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit (23-2807). On the same day, plaintiffs also filed an expedited motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal in the district court and the Ninth Circuit, asking both courts to enjoin defendants from enforcing SB 1100 until the Ninth Circuit could rule on the issue. The Ninth Circuit granted the temporary injunction on October 26, 2023. On the same day, the district court declared the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion moot due to the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s ruling. &nbsp;2023 WL 7109822.</p>\r\n<p>As of November 20, 2023, this case is pending before the Ninth Circuit, and defendants are enjoined from enforcing SB 1100.</p>",

On October 12, 2023, the district court denied both plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction and defendant’s motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit enjoined defendants from enforcing SB 1100 pending resolution of the appeal. As of November 20, 2023, this case is pending before the Ninth Circuit, and defendants are enjoined from enforcing SB 1100.",

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nDEBBIE CRITCHFIELD, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n   \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   1 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 2 of 21\nBefore this Court is a challenge to the State of Idaho’s attempt to designate the sex of \nindividual students in K-12 public schools for the purpose of categorically excluding transgender1 \nstudents from single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity. Idaho Code Ann. §§ 33-\n6601 et seq. (S.B. 1100).2  Though Idaho students have long used facilities such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms according to the sex with which they identify—and have done so without recorded \nincident—the  law  challenged  here  forbids  this  practice.    Purporting  to  address  a  purely \nhypothetical danger, S.B. 1100 demands that all Idaho K-12 public schools bar transgender \nstudents from using restrooms, changing facilities, and temporary sleeping quarters with students \nwho share their gender identity.  Idaho claims, without evidence, that this categorical exclusion \nprotects the privacy and safety of “all students.”  But within the category of “all students” are \ntransgender students, and S.B. 1100 threatens, in a very real and well-documented manner, their \nprivacy and safety and denies them their federally guaranteed right to access their public education \nfree from sex discrimination. \nThe United States has a significant interest in protecting the right of students to participate \nin an educational environment free of unlawful sex discrimination.  The U.S. Department of Justice \n(DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Education enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (Title IX), which protects students from sex discrimination in the \neducation programs and activities of federal funding recipients.  DOJ is charged with coordinating \n \n1 The term “transgender” describes a person whose gender identity differs from the person’s sex \nassigned at birth. Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1187 n.1 (9th Cir. 2019).  A person’s “gender \nidentity” is their “deep-core sense of self as being a particular gender.” Hecox v. Little, 479 F. \nSupp. 3d 930, 945 (D. Idaho 2020), aff’d, No. 20-35813, 2023 WL 1097255 (9th Cir. Jan. 30, \n2023) (citations omitted). \n2 Citations to Idaho Code Ann. §§ 33-6601 et seq. and S.B. 1100 are to Idaho Code Ann. (West \n2023), Title 33 Education, Chapter [67] 66 Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public \nSchools.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   2 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 3 of 21\nfederal agencies’ implementation and enforcement of Title IX. 28 § C.F.R. Pt. 54; Exec. Order No. \n12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, 1980); see also 28 § C.F.R. 0.51.  DOJ also has authority to \ninvestigate and resolve complaints that a public school board is depriving students of equal \nprotection based on sex. 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-6.  The United States has a significant interest in \nensuring that the proper legal standards are applied to private litigants’ claims under Title IX and \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.      \nThe United States therefore respectfully submits this Statement of Interest, under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 517,3 to advise the Court of its view that Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause do not permit \nIdaho to categorically exclude transgender students from using public schools’ multi-user, single-\nsex facilities consistent with their gender identity.4 \nBACKGROUND \nS.B. 1100 purports to decree each person’s “sex,” declaring that sex is “the immutable \nbiological  and  physiological  characteristics,  specifically  the  chromosomes  and  internal  and \nexternal reproductive anatomy, genetically determined at conception and generally recognizable \nat birth, that define an individual as male or female.”5 Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6602(3).  S.B. 1100 \nrequires public schools to designate all multi-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities “for use \nby male persons only or female persons only” and bar any person not a “member of that sex” from \nentering such facility. Id. § 33-6603(1) and (2).  The law also applies to overnight lodging \narrangements for school-sponsored activities, which it refers to as “sleeping quarters.” Id. § 33-\n \n3 “The Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may be sent by the Attorney \nGeneral to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in \na suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any other \ninterest of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 517. \n4 The United States takes no position on Plaintiffs’ right to privacy claim.   \n5 The United States does not concede to the accuracy of this definition.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   3 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 4 of 21\n6603(4).  S.B. 1100 provides for some exceptions, including for “coaching staff and personnel \nduring athletic events,” but makes no exception for transgender students. Id. § 33-6604.  And \nalthough S.B. 1100 includes “reasonable accommodation[s],” those accommodations do not, under \nany circumstances, allow a transgender student to access these sex-specific facilities if a person of \nthe “opposite sex . . . could be present.” See id. § 33-6605.    \nIdaho proffers “the privacy and safety of all students” as justification for these restrictions.  \nIdaho Code Ann. § 33-6601(7).  Specifically, Idaho claims that this law is justified because \nallowing students of the “opposite sex” to share restrooms and changing facilities “increas[es] the \nlikelihood of sexual assault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism” and “generates \npotential embarrassment, shame, and psychological injury to students.” Id. § 33-6601(4).  \nS.B. 1100 creates a private cause of action, allowing any student to sue their public school \nfor “each instance that [a] student encountered a person of the opposite sex” in a restroom, \nchanging room, or sleeping quarters. Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6606(1) and (3).  These students are \nentitled to $5000 in damages for each incident, as well as additional monetary damages and \nreasonable attorney’s fees. Id. § 33-6606(3) and (4). \nPlaintiff Rebecca Roe is a 12-year-old girl who is transgender and has attended Boise \nSchool District schools since kindergarten. No. 15-2, at 2.6  Rebecca’s declaration states that she \nis generally perceived as female by others and has used restrooms designated for girls outside of \nschool without incident. No. 15-2, at 3.  She has not used a boys’ or men’s restroom at school or \n \n6 “No.__, at __” refers to the docket entry number and page number of documents filed in this \ncase, using the Court’s CM/ECF pagination.  For purposes of this Statement of Interest, the United \nStates assumes the truth of Plaintiffs’ personal declarations, Nos. 15-2 (Decl. of Rebecca Roe); \n15-3 (Decl. of Rachel Roe); 15-4 (Decl. of A.J., President of Plaintiff SAGA), because those \ndeclarations are consistent with evidence and expert testimony the United States has encountered \nin its work about the experiences of many transgender students and their families, as well as with \nthe findings of this Court and others in other litigation involving transgender students. \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   4 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 5 of 21\noutside of school since the fifth grade. No. 15-2, at 4.  Before starting sixth grade, Rebecca planned \nto use the nurse’s restroom, but reports in her declaration that it was “stigmatizing and isolating” \nand less accessible than restrooms used by all the other girls at school. No. 15-2, at 4.  As a result, \nRebecca avers that she avoided using the restroom at school, limiting fluid intake and “hold[ing] \nit,” which was unhealthy and created a physical and mental distraction throughout the school day. \nNo. 15-2, at 4.  For seventh grade, Rebecca will attend a new school with new classmates and \nwants to use the girls’ facilities. No. 15-2, at 4-5.  Rebecca’s declaration expresses her fear that, if \nshe is required to use the boys’ restroom or a single-user restroom, classmates at her new school \nwould know that she is transgender. No. 15-2, at 5.  She states that, as the school year approaches, \nshe is experiencing stress and pain thinking about the stigma and burdens S.B. 1100 imposes. No. \n15-2, at 4-5.  Rebecca’s mother’s declaration states that she and her husband worry about their \nchild’s physical safety, mental health, and general well-being because revealing that Rebecca is \ntransgender makes her vulnerable to violence and targeting by other students. No. 15-3, at 4.  \nPlaintiff Sexuality and Gender Alliance (SAGA), is a student-led organization for high \nschool students at Boise High School. No. 15-4, at 2.  As set forth in the declaration of A.J., current \npresident of SAGA, one of the organization’s goals is “to ensure that LGBTQ+ students are safe \nand welcome at school.” No. 15-4, at 2.  SAGA has transgender members who, consistent with \ntheir school’s policies pre-dating S.B. 1100, wish to use multi-occupancy restrooms and facilities \nthat align with their gender identity. No. 15-4, at 2-3.  A.J. is one of these students.  Since the \neleventh grade, A.J. reports in his declaration, he has used boys’ restrooms consistent with his \ngender-support plan and has had no problems with other students when doing so. No. 15-4, at 3.  \nBoise High School has only one single-user restroom that is less accessible than the various multi-\n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   5 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 6 of 21\nuser restrooms and is sometimes closed for use. No. 15-4, at 4.  A.J.’s declaration states that the \nthought of being forced to use the girls’ restroom makes him “feel ill.” Ibid. \nS.B. 1100 now prohibits all Idaho public schools from allowing transgender students to use \nsingle-sex facilities with peers who share their gender identity.  As a result, transgender students \nlike Plaintiffs face an impossible choice: use facilities that do not align with their gender identities \nat the expense of their health, privacy, and safety; use separate, incomparable, single-user facilities \nand be outed as transgender to their peers, also at the expense of their health, privacy, and safety; \nor continue to use their established facilities and risk a damages lawsuit against their school.  \nPlaintiffs therefore ask this Court to maintain the pre-S.B. 1100 status quo and enjoin Idaho from \nenforcing S.B. 1100. No. 1, at 38.7 \nARGUMENT \nOn a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court reviews: (1) the movant’s likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant absent an injunction; (3) the \nbalance of hardships; and (4) the public interest. Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d \n1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  The United States believes that Plaintiffs will likely succeed on the \n \n7 Where plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the merits, there is no \nheightened burden of proof.  Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 972.  The relevant “status quo” for purposes \nof  an  injunction  “refers  to  the  legally  relevant  relationship  between  the  parties  before  the \ncontroversy arose.” Ibid. (citing Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th \nCir. 2014)).  Here, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to contest the enforceability \nof S.B. 1100.  The status quo, therefore, is the policy in Idaho prior to S.B. 1100’s enactment. See \nibid.  Prior to the enactment of S.B. 1100, Plaintiffs’ school district designated multiuser, single-\nsex restrooms and changing facilities women/girls or men/boys and permitted students to use \nfacilities consistent with their gender identity.  Idaho’s legislative finding that the “long-standing” \npractice was to separate such facilities based on “biological sex” discounts the long history of \npeople who are transgender using single-sex facilities in Idaho that align with their gender \nidentities without incident.  Idaho’s attempt at restrictively defining a person’s sex to limit \ntransgender students’ access to school facilities is what is new.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   6 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 7 of 21\nmerits of their Title IX and Equal Protection Clause claims and does not address the other \npreliminary injunction factors. \n  First, S.B. 1100 restrictively defines “sex” to categorically exclude students who are \ntransgender from their public schools’ multiuser, single-sex restrooms and changing facilities that \nare consistent with their gender identity.  Taking as true Plaintiffs’ personal declarations—which \nare consistent with the findings of this Court and others regarding transgender youth generally—\nthis sex-based exclusion causes Plaintiffs substantial harm and deprives them of educational \nopportunities.  S.B. 1100 therefore forces Plaintiffs’ public schools to discriminate against them \non the basis of sex in violation of Title IX, and no statutory or regulatory exception permits them \nto do so.  \nSecond, S.B. 1100 runs afoul of the Equal Protection Clause’s demand that the law’s sex-\nbased classifications be substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental \nobjective. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (VMI).  S.B. 1100, both by its \nterms  and  against  the  backdrop  of  its  legislative  record,  lacks  an  “exceedingly  persuasive \njustification”  for  its  categorical  exclusion  of  transgender  students  from  single-sex  facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity, and therefore cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. See \nibid.    \nI.    Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prevail on Their Title IX Claim \n  Title IX provides, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \nPlaintiffs prevail on their Title IX claim by showing that: (1) their educational institution receives \nfederal financial assistance; (2) they were excluded from participation in an education program or \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   7 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 8 of 21\nactivity on the basis of sex; and (3) the exclusion caused them legally cognizable harm. See Grimm \nv. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 616-17 (4th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted), as amended \n(Aug. 28, 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  Plaintiffs are likely to make these showings.   \n  First, Boise School District is a public school district that receives federal funds.  Second, \nS.B. 1100 requires the district to exclude transgender students like Plaintiffs from an education \nprogram or activity—namely, school facilities—“on the basis of sex.” See Grimm, 972 F.3d at \n616.  S.B. 1100 defines what it means to be of the male or female “sex” and then bars students \nwhose gender identity is different from their “sex” as defined in the statute from entering school \nrestrooms and changing facilities designated for “the opposite sex.” Idaho Code Ann. §§ 33-6602-\n33-6603.  The purpose and effect of S.B. 1100 is to exclude transgender students like Plaintiffs \nfrom those public-school facilities because of their sex assigned at birth, or, as the legislature terms \nit, their “biological sex.” Id. § 33-6604(2).  This is, by definition, exclusion “on the basis of sex.” \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1739, 1741 (2020); Grabowski v. Arizona Bd. of \nRegents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 2023) (citing Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th 103, 114 (9th Cir. \n2022) (finding Bostock controlling with respect to the meaning of discrimination on the basis of \nsex under Title IX).   \n  Finally, assuming the truth of Plaintiffs’ personal declarations, the sex-based exclusions \nmandated by S.B. 1100 subject them to cognizable harm.  It is this injury that renders Plaintiffs’ \nexclusion from single-sex facilities “discriminatory” under Title IX. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at \n1753  (quoting  Burlington  N.  &  Santa  Fe  Ry.  Co.,  548  U.S.  53,  59  (2006))  (“[T]he  term \n‘discriminate against’ refers to ‘distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected \nindividuals.’”).   \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   8 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 9 of 21\nPlaintiffs’ declarations describe the concrete and substantial harms this exclusion will \nimpose on them. See, e.g., Nos. 15-2, 15-3, 15-4.  Plaintiffs also offer declarations from school \nlaw enforcement, a psychologist and professor with expertise in transgender health, and school \nadministrators who work with transgender students to underscore these harms. See, e.g., Nos. 15-\n8, at 12; 15-5, at 22; 15-6, at 4.  The harms described in these declarations are consistent with \nharms recognized by courts in other cases involving the exclusion of transgender students from \nsingle-sex facilities. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 597-601, 617-18 (bathroom policy made plaintiff feel \n“alienat[ed]” and “humiliat[ed]”); Dodds v. U. S. Dep’t of Educ., 845 F.3d 217, 221-22 (6th Cir. \n2016) (exclusion from the girls’ restrooms “had substantial and immediate adverse effects” on \nplaintiff’s  “daily  life,”  “health,”  and  “well-being”);  A.C.  by  M.C.  v.  Metro.  Sch.  Dist.  of \nMartinsville, No. 22-1786, 2023 WL 4881915, at *8 (7th Cir.

Nos. 15-2, at 5; 15-4, \nat 2; Grimm, 972 F.3d at 617-18 (quoting Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 530 \n(3d  Cir.  2018))  (forcing  transgender  students  to  use  gender-neutral  facility  would  likewise \n“constitute harm under Title IX, as it ‘invites more scrutiny and attention’ from other students, \n‘very publicly branding all transgender students with a scarlet ‘T’.”) (brackets omitted), cert. \ndenied, 139 S.

The only question, then, is whether Title IX contains an exception that would allow \nrecipients to subject Plaintiffs to sex-based harm in the context that S.B. 1100 applies.  It does not.   \nSince 1975, Title IX’s implementing regulations have specified that separate or differential \ntreatment on the basis of sex is presumptively a form of prohibited sex discrimination. See, e.g., \n34 CFR § 106.31(b)(4), (7) (“Except as provided in this subpart, in providing any aid, benefit, or \nservice to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis of sex . . . [s]ubject any person to separate \nor different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; [or] [o]therwise limit any person in \nthe enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.”).  Nevertheless, the regulations \nhave recognized limited contexts in which recipients are permitted to separate students on the basis \nof sex, including restrooms and locker rooms. See 34 C.F.R § 106.33 (toilet, locker room, and \nshower facilities); see also, e.g., id. § 106.34(a)(3) (human sexuality classes).  But these limited \ninstances of allowable separation do not, and cannot, sanction sex-based harm to students in these \ncontexts. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 618 (“[T]he implementing regulation cannot override the \nstatutory prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex.”).  Rather, the regulations allow \nthis separation precisely because excluding a student from a particular single-sex restroom or \nlocker room facility designated for another sex, as a general rule, does not cause that student harm. \nCf. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998) (Title VII does not reach \nnon-harmful “differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with” each other).  That \ngeneral rule, however, does not hold when the student is transgender.  In that circumstance, such \nexclusion does impose not only legally cognizable but substantial harm of the type Plaintiffs’ \ndeclarations describe. See Nos. 15-2, 15-3, 15-4.   \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   10 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 11 of 21\nThus, to the extent that Title IX’s regulations permit sex-separation of restrooms and \nchanging facilities in K-12 schools, a recipient may not carry out such separation in a manner that \ndiscriminates against students by subjecting them to the kind of harms at issue here—which, as \nreflected in numerous court opinions—are substantial. See Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d \n1210, 1227 (9th Cir.) (“[J]ust because Title IX authorizes sex-segregated facilities does not mean \nthat they are required, let alone that they must be segregated based only on biological sex and \ncannot accommodate gender identity.”), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 892 (2020); Grimm, 972 F.3d at \n618 (“All [Title IX’s implementing regulation] suggests is that the act of creating sex-separated \nrestrooms in and of itself is not discriminatory—not that, in applying bathroom policies to \n[transgender] students . . . the Board may rely on its own discriminatory notions of what ‘sex’ \nmeans.”).  \nThere  are  likewise  no  statutory  exemptions  or  other  statutory  provisions  that  allow \nrecipients to discriminate in the context of sex-separate bathrooms and changing facilities in K-12 \npublic schools.  Indeed, Congress has specified limited circumstances where Title IX does not \nprohibit harm resulting from sex separation. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. §1681 (a) (1-9); 20 U.S.C. § 1686.  \nIn  particular,  the  statute’s  “living  facilities”  provision  carves  out  from  Title  IX’s  general \nprohibition on sex discrimination an allowance for recipients to maintain sex-separate living \nfacilities. 20 U.S.C. §1686 (“Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in [Title IX],” \nnothing in Title IX “shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution . . . from maintaining \nseparate living facilities for the different sexes.”).  But that carve out does not apply to restrooms, \nlocker rooms, or shower facilities, which the Title IX regulations have long addressed separately \nfrom “living facilities.” Compare 34 C.F.R. § 106.32 (housing, citing Section 907 of the Education \nAmendments (20 U.S.C. §1686) as its statutory authority) with 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 (toilet, locker \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   11 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 12 of 21\nroom, and shower facilities, citing Section 901 of the Education Amendments (20 U.S.C. §1681) \nas its statutory authority); 40 Fed. Reg. 24128, 24141 (June 4, 1975).8  Congress therefore created \nno statutory exemption or carve out for sex-separate restrooms and changing facilities in K-12 \npublic schools, which are governed by Title IX’s general non-discrimination mandate prohibiting \nsex-based exclusions that “injure protected individuals.” See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753.9 \nIn short, Title IX and its regulations provide no “safe harbor” for S.B. 1100 and other laws \nand policies that seek to exclude students who are transgender from using the single-sex bathrooms \nand changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity.  If this Court determines \nPlaintiffs have established the facts described in their declarations, which are consistent with facts \nfound in other cases cited above, the United States believes they are likely to prevail on the merits \nof their Title IX claim. \nII.  S.B. 1100 Violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Constitution prohibits Idaho from implementing S.B. 1100.  The law classifies on the \nbasis of sex and discriminates against people who are transgender, a “quasi-suspect class.” See \nKarnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1201 (9th Cir. 2019).  S.B. 1100 must therefore withstand \nheightened scrutiny.  It does not.  Even assuming Idaho’s asserted interest in “protecting the \nprivacy and safety of all students” is genuine, S.B. 1100 is not, either on its face or on the basis of \n \n8  See https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-86. \n9 This Court should therefore decline to follow the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning that the statutory \ncarve out for living facilities should somehow be understood to also create a carve out for \nbathrooms and locker rooms, which are clearly governed not by Section 1686, but by the statute’s \ngeneral nondiscrimination mandate, Section 1681. See Adams v. Sch. Bd. Of St. Johns Cnty., 57 \nF.4th 791, 813-14 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc).  Such reasoning cannot be reconciled with Title IX’s \nplain text and ignores that Congress could have, but did not, address anything other than the \npractice of maintaining sex-separate “living facilities” in Section 1686.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   12 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 13 of 21\nits legislative record, substantially related to the achievement of that goal.  Plaintiffs are therefore \nlikely to succeed on the merits on their equal protection claim. \nA.  S.B. 1100 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Under the Equal Protection Clause  \n \nHeightened scrutiny applies here because S.B. 1100 classifies based on sex and because it \ndiscriminates against people who are transgender, a quasi-suspect class. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at \n608 (holding that an exclusionary bathroom policy relied on sex-based classifications); Karnoski, \n926 F.3d at 1201 (accepting district court’s determination that transgender people are members of \na quasi-suspect class). \nS.B. 1100 restrictively defines “sex,” then limits how students may access facilities based \non that definition.  The law therefore relies on a sex-based classification and cannot be enforced \n“without referencing sex.” Grimm, 972 F.3d at 608 (quoting Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051).  The \nSupreme  Court  has  long  recognized  that  such  sex-based  classifications  warrant  heightened \nscrutiny. See, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 532-33 (citing Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 \n(1982)).  Indeed, every circuit to address transgender students’ access to sex-separated spaces has \napplied heightened scrutiny. Grimm, 972 F.3d at 607-10; Dodds, 845 F.3d at 221 (affirming district \ncourt decision that employed heightened scrutiny because bathroom policy discriminates based on \nsex stereotypes); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (same); Martinsville, No. 2023 WL 4881915, at *8; \nAdams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 803 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc).  \nHeightened scrutiny also applies here because transgender people are a quasi-suspect class.  \nIn Karnoski, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s determination that, applying the relevant \nfactors, transgender people constitute a quasi-suspect class. 926 F.3d at 1201 (“the district court \nreasonably applied the factors ordinarily used to determine whether a classification affects a \nsuspect or quasi-suspect class”).  This conclusion is consistent with the decisions of many other \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   13 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 14 of 21\ncourts to have considered the question. See, e.g., Grimm, 972 F.3d at 610-13.10  This Court should \nnot hesitate to reach the same conclusion.  It is irrelevant that S.B. 1100 refrains from explicitly \nusing the word “transgender”: under the law’s definition of “sex,” transgender students are the \nonly students banned from facilities that align with their gender identity. See Hecox v. Little, 479 \nF. Supp. 3d 930, 975 (D. Idaho 2020), aff’d, No. 20-35813, 2023 WL 1097255 (9th Cir. Jan. 30, \n2023).  S.B. 1100 thus discriminates against transgender students, who are members of a quasi-\nsuspect class, and employs a classification based on sex.  Idaho, therefore, must show that S.B. \n1100 survives heightened scrutiny.  \nB.  S.B. 1100 Cannot Survive Heightened Scrutiny   \n \nTo survive heightened scrutiny, Idaho must show the law “serves important governmental \nobjectives” and the “discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement \nof those objectives.” See VMI, 518 U.S. at 524 (quoting Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 724).  \n“The burden of justification is demanding[,] rests entirely on the State,” and must be “‘exceedingly \npersuasive.’” Id. at 533 (quoting Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 724).  The governmental \ninterest “must be genuine, not hypothesized” and “must not rely on overbroad generalizations.” \nIbid.  A classification does not withstand heightened scrutiny when “the alleged objective” of the \nclassification differs from the “actual purpose.” Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 730.  \n \n10 See also Ray v. McCloud, 507 F. Supp. 3d 925, 937 (S.D. Ohio 2020); F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. \nSupp. 3d 1131, 1145 (D.

Idaho \nclaims that S.B. 1100 furthers the important governmental interest of “protecting the privacy and \nsafety of all students.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6601(7) (emphasis added).  Even if this stated \npurpose is genuine, S.B. 1100 is not “substantially related” to the achievement of that objective. \nSee VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  In fact, S.B. 1100’s categorical exclusion of \ntransgender students from sex-specific facilities consistent with their gender identity significantly \njeopardizes their safety and privacy, and does little, if anything, to advance the privacy and safety \nof other students. See Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 976 (citing Latta v. Otter, 19 F. Supp. 3d 1054, \n1077 (D. Idaho), aff’d, 771 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2014)) (courts evaluate whether the “proffered \njustifications overcome the injury and indignity inflicted on Plaintiffs and others like them.”).  S.B. \n1100 is therefore not substantially related to its stated purpose.  \nFirst, S.B. 1100’s stated purpose of “protecting the privacy and safety of all students” \nnecessarily includes the safety and privacy of transgender students, as the word “all,” by definition, \nis encompassing.  The law, however, threatens rather than protects transgender students’ safety \nand privacy.  Using school facilities matching their gender identity is essential to the mental health \nand physical safety of transgender students. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 595-97 (discussing the \nsignificant body of evidence and research on this topic and describing the mental and physical \nharms associated with excluding a transgender child from school facilities consistent with their \ngender identity); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1040-42, 1045-46 (discussing the irreparable harm, \nincluding depression, thoughts of suicide, and intrusion on privacy, that transgender student was \nlikely to suffer if excluded from the boys’ bathroom and required to use single-user restroom).  As \nthe Third Circuit recognized, “transgender students face extraordinary social, psychological, and \nmedical risks” that weigh heavily in favor of allowing them to live consistent with their gender \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   15 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 16 of 21\nidentities at school, which includes access to appropriate facilities. Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 529 \n(finding that policies allowing transgender students to use facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity is necessary because doing otherwise “can exacerbate gender dysphoria, lead to negative \neducational outcomes, and precipitate self-injurious behavior.”).11   \nMoreover, S.B. 1100 creates a private cause of action that incentivizes students to surveil \ntransgender students, or any student suspected of being transgender, further placing their safety \nand privacy at risk. Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6606 (providing that any student who “encounters a \nperson of the opposite sex” in a public-school restroom, changing facility, or sleeping quarters has \na private cause of action against the school district and may recover $5000).  S.B. 1100 provides \na financial inducement for students to police one another, even in schools where transgender \nstudents have used the facilities consistent with their gender identity without incident, creating \nnew and pressing safety issues for transgender students who are already the subject of increased \nvictimization by their peers. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 597.   Should a transgender student, or any \nstudent for that matter, be accused of entering the “wrong” restroom or changing room, they may \nvery well be made the subject of an inquiry into their “external reproductive anatomy.”  Idaho \nCode Ann. § 33-6602(3).  This provision shows that S.B. 1100 was clearly not intended to ensure \nthe safety and privacy of all students.  \nS.B.  1100’s  “accommodations”  provisions  do  nothing  to  alleviate  these  threats  to \ntransgender students’ safety and privacy.  In fact, forcing transgender students to use single-user \nrestrooms threatens to out them as transgender to their peers. See Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 530 \n(forcing transgender students to use single-user facilities causes “extraordinary consequences” that \n \n11 S.B. 1100’s legislative findings acknowledge these cases. See Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6601.  Yet, \nthe statute and legislative record fail to grapple with their holdings and detailed analyses. \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   16 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 17 of 21\nnon-transgender students who voluntarily use single-user facilities do not experience); Whitaker, \n858 F.3d at 1045 (requiring a transgender student to use single-user facilities “actually invited \nmore scrutiny and attention from his peers”).  As courts have recognized, requiring transgender \nstudents to use single-user facilities publicly brands them as unequal, invades their privacy, and \nrenders them vulnerable to violence and harassment. See Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 530; see also \nGrimm, 972 F.3d at 609; Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1045.   \nIn short, S.B. 1100 creates rather than solves safety and privacy problems, particularly for \ntransgender students.  Because S.B. 1100 itself subjects transgender students to harm and severely \ncompromises their privacy and safety, Idaho cannot show that the law is “substantially related” to \nits stated purpose of protecting “all students.” See VMI, 518 U.S. at 533. \n  Second, S.B. 1100 does little, if anything, to advance the safety and privacy of non-\ntransgender students.  S.B. 1100 claims the law protects students from “sexual assault, molestation, \nrape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6601(4).  But schools already create \nand  enforce  nondiscriminatory  rules  designed  to  ensure  the  safety  of  their  facilities.  See \nMartinsville, 2023 WL 4881915, at *9 (noting that schools monitor student conduct in bathrooms \nand locker rooms and gender-affirming policies “neither thwart rule enforcement nor increase the \nrisk of misbehavior” in those facilities).  The legislative record is bereft of any evidence of \ntransgender students in Idaho engaging in any of the named conduct.  Instead, proponents \nconceded that there were no “documented cases of trans person violence on non-trans people.” \nProtecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public Schools: Hearing on S.B. 1100 Before the \nH. Educ. Comm., 67th Leg., 1st Sess. (Idaho 2023) (00:40:05-00:40:50) (statements of Rep. \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   17 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 18 of 21\nWoodings and Rep. Hill, Members, H. Comm. on Educ.).12  Thus, even if this Court were to credit \nthe legislative record’s statements about supposed safety threats to public school students arising \nfrom the use of restrooms by persons of the “opposite sex,” as the law defines that term, Idaho \noffers no justification for applying those assumptions so sweepingly to all transgender students. \nSee  VMI,  518  U.S.  at  541-42  (justifications  for  sex-based  classifications  must  not  rely  on \n“overbroad generalizations,” and “we have cautioned reviewing courts to take a hard look at \ngeneralizations or tendencies of the kind pressed by [the State]”) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).    \nSimilarly,  Idaho  claims  that  S.B.  1100’s  categorical  ban  is  justified  because  of  the \n“potential embarrassment, shame, and psychological injury” some students might feel if they share \na restroom or changing facility with a person of “the opposite biological sex.” Idaho Code Ann. § \n33-6601(4).  Courts have found that such privacy justifications cannot substantiate the exclusion \nof transgender students from single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity, given the \nreality  of  how  they  use  those  facilities.  See,  e.g.,  Grimm,  972  F.3d  at  613-15  (Excluding \ntransgender students from restrooms that correspond to their gender identity “ignores the reality \nof how a transgender child uses the bathroom: by entering a stall and closing the door.”) (quoting \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052); Martinsville, 2023 WL 4881915, at *9 (“Gender-affirming facility \naccess does not implicate the interest in preventing bodily exposure because there is no such \n \n12 Idaho legislators appeared to rely on an incident in Loudoun County, Virginia as justification \nfor S.B. 1100. See Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public Schools: Hearing on \nS.B. 1100 Before the H. Educ. Comm., 67th Leg., 1st Sess. (Idaho 2023) (00:32:44-00:33:10) \n(statement of Rep. Wisniewski, Member, H. Comm. On Education).  Nebulous references to a \nsingle out-of-state incident that may not even involve a transgender student do not provide an \n“exceedingly persuasive” justification for the sweeping exclusion of transgender students from all \nsingle-sex facilities in Idaho public schools. See Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 978-79 (anecdotes \nabout runners from other states were insufficient to support banning transgender athletes in Idaho) \n(citation omitted).   \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   18 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 19 of 21\nexposure.”); Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052 (“A transgender student’s presence in the restroom \nprovides no more of a risk to other students’ privacy rights than . . . any other student who uses \nthe bathroom at the same time.”).  Such injuries are insufficient to justify categorically excluding \nall transgender students from single-sex school facilities consistent with their gender identity, \nparticularly when doing so subjects them to concrete, demonstrable embarrassment, shame, and \npsychological, and even physical, injuries. See Boyertown, 897 F.3d at 529-30 (finding that non-\ntransgender students’ discomfort could not be “equate[d] . . . with the very drastic consequences \nthat the transgender students must endure if the school were to ignore the latter’s needs and \nconcerns”); see also Parents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at 1225 (holding that transgender students’ \naccess to bathrooms matching their gender identity did not violate non-transgender students’ \nconstitutional privacy right).  Idaho’s “proffered justification[]” of privacy for non-transgender \nstudents does not “overcome the injury and indignity inflicted on [transgender students].” See \nHecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 976 (citation omitted).   \nFinally, to the extent Idaho claims S.B. 1100 is clearly related to its important objective of \nprotecting the privacy interests of students to use facilities away from the “opposite biological sex” \nas S.B. 1100 defines that term, this reasoning is fatally circular. See, e.g., Adams, 57 F.4th at 805 \n(reasoning, in circular fashion, that “[t]he School Board’s bathroom policy is clearly related to—\nindeed, is almost a mirror of—its objective of protecting the privacy interests of students to use \nthe bathroom away from the opposite sex”).  The State cannot simply argue that its discriminatory \nmeans (excluding students from facilities based on “sex” without regard for gender identity) is \njustified by its discriminatory ends (separating facilities on the basis of “sex” without regard for \ngender identity). See VMI, 518 U.S. at 545 (rejecting as “notably circular” and a misperception of \nthe Court’s precedent the State’s argument that “[s]ingle-sex education at VMI serves an important \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   19 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 20 of 21\ngovernmental objective, . . . and exclusion of women is not only substantially related, it is essential \nto that objective”) (internal citations omitted).  If this sort of circular reasoning were sufficient to \nwithstand heightened scrutiny, all sex-based exclusions could be justified as substantially related \nto the “important” goal of sex separation simply by stating as much.  VMI explicitly rejected this \nfaulty logic, see ibid., and this Court should too.      \nIn sum, if privacy and safety of all students is Idaho’s goal, S.B. 1100 does not further it.  \nS.B. 1100 disregards the safety and privacy of transgender students and exacerbates dangers they \nalready face.  And the legislative record fails to demonstrate that the categorical exclusion of \ntransgender students from single-sex facilities consistent with their gender identity is “substantially \nrelated” to protecting the safety and privacy of other, non-transgender students.  Because Idaho \nhas  not  demonstrated  an  “exceedingly  persuasive  justification”  for  its  discriminatory  law, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim.  \nCONCLUSION \n  S.B.  1100  requires  public  schools  to  discriminate  against  transgender  students  by \nsubjecting them to sex-based harms and depriving them of equal educational opportunities in \nviolation of Title IX.  S.B. 1100’s exclusionary sex-based means also do not further Idaho’s \npurported goal of protecting all students’ privacy and safety.  Instead, S.B. 1100 imposes state-\nsanctioned injuries and indignity on transgender students.  Such a law cannot withstand the \nheightened scrutiny the Constitution requires.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their Title IX and equal protection claims. \n   \n \nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   20 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 41   Filed 08/08/23   Page 21 of 21\nRespectfully submitted, this 8th day of August, 2023.  \n \nJOSHUA D.

INTRODUCTION  \nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs Rebecca Roe, Rachel and Ryan Roe, and Sexuality \nand  Gender  Alliance’s  (collectively  “Plaintiffs”)  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction \nPending Appeal. Dkt. 64. Defendants Debbie Critchfield et al. (collectively “Defendants”) \noppose the motion. Dkt. 68. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs’ motion is MOOT.   \nII. BACKGROUND1 \n  On July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant action alleging a newly-enacted statute \nin Idaho, S.B. 1100, is unconstitutional and violates: (1) the Equal Protection Clause, (2) \nTitle IX, and (3) their right to privacy. Dkt. 1, at 30–37. Alongside their Complaint, \nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“PI Motion”) seeking to enjoin the law \n \n1 A more complete background can be found in the Court’s prior decision. Dkt. 60, at 3–7. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 1 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 75   Filed 10/27/23   Page 2 of 6\nduring the pendency of this litigation. Dkt. 15. Defendants subsequently filed a Motion to \nDismiss. Dkt. 47.  \nAfter briefing and a hearing, the Court issued a decision denying both motions. Dkt. \n60. As it relates to the PI Motion, the Court found Plaintiffs had not shown they were likely \nto succeed on any of their claims because: (1) S.B. 1100 is based on sex, not gender \nidentity, and is related to the state of Idaho’s substantial interests of privacy and safety; (2) \nS.B. 1100 does not violate Title IX because Title IX allows for this type of scheme; and \n(3)  Plaintiff’s  did  not  demonstrate  they  have  a  protectable  liberty  interest  in  the \nnondisclosure of their gender identity for privacy purposes. Id. at 35–36. The Court also \nfound, however, that Defendants had not carried their burden for full dismissal of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. Id. at 36.  \n  The Court issued its decision on Thursday, October 12, 2023, and indicated that \nS.B. 1100 would take effect 21 days later—on November 2, 2023. Id. at 36–37. \nOn Monday, October 16, 2023, Plaintiffs appealed the Court’s decision to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Dkt. 67. They also filed, with this Court, an Expedited Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal. Dkt. 64. Therein, Plaintiffs requested this \nCourt stay its decision during the pendency of the appeal. See generally id. Plaintiffs also \nindicated that, because of the short timeframe before S.B. 1100 was set to take effect, it \nhad filed its motion for relief simultaneously with the Ninth Circuit. Dkt. 64-1, at 2 n.1. \nThis Court communicated informally with Counsel and set an expedited briefing schedule. \nDkt. 65. That order set a deadline of Sunday, October 22, 2023, for Defendants’ Response \nand noon on October 25, 2023, for Plaintiffs’ reply. Id.  This Court’s intent was to rule on \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 2 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 75   Filed 10/27/23   Page 3 of 6\nPlaintiffs’ Motion by Friday, October 27, 2023. \nThe parties dutifully and timely filed their briefs with this Court. Dkts. 68, 72. They \nfiled  virtually  identical  briefs  in  front  of  the  Ninth  Circuit  on  a  similarly  shortened \ntimeframe. Dkts. 70, 71.  \nOn the afternoon of October 26, 2023, Plaintiffs’ Counsel alerted the Court (via \nemail)2 to the fact that the Ninth Circuit had ruled on the matter and stayed the Court’s \ndecision (and, therefore, S.B. 1100). \nIII. DISCUSSION \n  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 8 outlines that a party “must ordinarily move \nfirst in the district court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending \nappeal.” Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Rule 8(a)(2) outlines that a motion \nfor such relief “may” be made to the Court of Appeals if the movant shows that “moving \nfirst in the district court would be impracticable” or that “the district court denied the \nmotion or failed to afford the relief requested . . . .” Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2)(A)(i)–(ii).  \n  In this case, this Court set an appropriate briefing schedule so that it could rule on \nPlaintiffs’ Motion. Dkt. 65. While it did not explicitly state in its order setting that schedule \nthat it planned to rule on the motion expeditiously, the schedule outlined clearly indicated \nthe  same.3  Based  upon  this  Court’s  prior  experience  in  these  types  of  situations,  it \nunderstood its responsibility was to quickly adjudicate the motion so that the parties could, \n \n2 The Ninth Circuit’s Order was filed with this Court this afternoon. Dkt. 74.    \n \n3 In other words, the Court would not set a schedule that had briefing conclude eight full days prior to S.B. \n1100 going into effect to then sit on its hands and do nothing.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 3 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 75   Filed 10/27/23   Page 4 of 6\nif necessary, ask the Ninth Circuit for relief. The schedule it laid out provided sufficient \ntime for the parties, this Court, and the Ninth Circuit to resolve the matter. \n  Unbeknownst to this Court, however, the Ninth Circuit then ruled on the matter \nbefore it had an opportunity to do so. That ruling effectively moots Plaintiffs’ request \nbefore this Court. Thus, the Court will not opine further on the merits of Plaintiffs’ request \nfor a stay pending appeal. However, it will share a few procedural thoughts in the hopes \nthat situations like this can be avoided in the future.  \n  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 8 is clear. A party seeking relief must seek \nthat relief from the district court before seeking it from the appealed court unless exigent \ncircumstances  exist.  Here,  Plaintiffs  filed  their  brief  requesting  emergency  relief \nsimultaneously before the district court and the Ninth Circuit because of the relatively short \ntimeframe involved. Critically, however, in those briefs, Plaintiffs never posture that asking \nthe district court would be impracticable.4 Said another way, Plaintiffs never argued, or \nshowed, that following the standard procedure would not serve their purposes. And how \ncould they? When they filed their brief, there were still seventeen days until S.B. 1100 \nwent into effect.5 Additionally, in issuing its stay, the Ninth Circuit did not make a finding \nthat waiting for the district court would be impracticable.6 \n \n4 The Court does not have access to the Ninth Circuit’s new case management and filing system. Thus, it \ncannot see all that is in the appellate file. However, some of the briefs on appeal have been transmitted to \nthe district court. As with the briefs before this Court, there is no mention in the briefs before the Ninth \nCircuit of impracticability.  \n5 In like manner, Plaintiffs could not argue that the district court had denied their motion or failed to afford \nthe relief requested because the district court had not yet ruled.  \n \n6 There are no Ninth Circuit cases the Court can locate that require the Circuit Court to wait for a decision \nfrom the district court before ruling. But there are likewise no cases the Court can locate where the Circuit \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 4 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 75   Filed 10/27/23   Page 5 of 6\n  Respectfully,  the Court does not  understand  why  the  Ninth  Circuit  elected  to \nintervene without waiting for an order from this Court. The undersigned and his staff have \nspent considerable time and resources on this case (including the present motion). It \nplanned to issue a decision today (Friday, October 27, 2023). The Ninth Circuit could have \npotentially benefitted from this Court’s decision. To be fair, the Ninth Circuit did not know \nwhen, or if, this Court was going to issue a decision. That said, it would not have been \ndifficult to ascertain the Court’s plans from its briefing schedule or even via other informal \n(or formal) means.7  \n  In its order granting Plaintiffs’  relief, the  Ninth Circuit does not provide any \nexplanation or analysis for its decision: as a whole or related to its early intervention. There \nis no indication that the exigent circumstances warranting its authority and intervention \nwere yet at play. Nevertheless, it decided to step in all the same. Having done so Plaintiffs’ \nMotion before this Court is now MOOT. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n  Candidly, the Court is not comfortable with how this happened procedurally. It \ncoordinated with the parties, expended resources, and made plans to rule on the motion \npursuant to its authority while still providing ample time for the Ninth Circuit to also take \n \nCourt did not make an explicit finding of impracticability in issuing a decision before a district court had \nthe opportunity to rule. However, other Circuits have held that it is erroneous for a party to seek a stay from \nthe Circuit Court before the district court rules on this type of motion. See, e.g., Whole Woman’s Health v. \nPaxton, 972 F.3d 649, 653-54 (5th Cir. 2020); SEC v. Dunlap, 253 F.3d 768, 774 (4th Cir. 2001); Hirschfeld \nv. Bd. of Elections in City of New York, 984 F.2d 35, 40 (2d Cir. 1993). \n \n7 Again, the Court is not implying the Ninth Circuit did anything inherently wrong here. These are their \nrules, and they can interpret them how they see fit. But a head’s up would have saved significant time and \nresources and been appreciated.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 5 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 75   Filed 10/27/23   Page 6 of 6\nup the matter (if needed). Plaintiffs did not present any circumstances indicating it would \nbe “impracticable” for the district court to make a ruling first. And the Ninth Circuit’s \ndecision cites none. The Court, of course, defers to the Circuit. It greatly respects its federal \njudicial colleagues at all levels—District, Circuit, and Supreme. But from an organizational \nand procedural standpoint, this could have been handled better.  \nV. ORDER \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (Dkt. 64) is MOOT. \n2.  The Clerk of the Court shall send a copy of this order to the Ninth Circuit for \nplacement, if appropriate, in Circuit Case No. 23-2807.  \n \n  DATED: October 27, 2023 \n   \n \n  _________________________            \nDavid C.

This lawsuit challenges Idaho Senate Bill 1100 (“S.B. 1100”), a sweeping law \nthat excludes Idaho’s transgender students from school restrooms and other facilities matching \ntheir gender identity beginning on July 1, 2023, and thereby denies them the equal dignity and \nrespect that Idaho affords to non-transgender youth.  S.B. 1100 will hurt Idaho’s transgender \nyouth—damaging their health, subjecting them to stigma and harassment in their schools, and \nincreasing their risk of anxiety, depression, and suicide.  And it will do so even though the \nLegislature that passed S.B. 1100 could not identify evidence supporting its purported findings \nthat S.B. 1100 is necessary to protect the safety and privacy of non-transgender students.  To the \ncontrary, numerous Idaho schools have had inclusive facilities policies that respect the gender \nidentity of transgender students for almost a decade.  Such schools have had no reported \ninstances that such policies threatened the privacy or safety of non-transgender students.  As \nnumerous federal courts across the United States have held for years in regard to similar policies, \nS.B. 1100 violates the fundamental promise of equality enshrined in the Equal Protection Clause \nof the United States Constitution, among other protections, as well as Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 3 of 44\n2.  S.B. 1100 is a solution in search of a problem.  Many schools across Idaho have \nallowed transgender students to use facilities matching their gender identity for years without \nincident.  There is no evidence that these policies and practices have harmed any non-\ntransgender student.  Nevertheless, S.B. 1100 imposes a blanket statewide ban that schools must \nfollow, strips transgender students of equal access to communal facilities, and subjects them to \nprofound harm—in the name of protecting non-transgender students from privacy and safety \nharms that do not exist.   \n3.  S.B. 1100 does not stop there.  It also places a “bounty” on the heads of \ntransgender students by allowing any student to recover thousands of dollars in minimum \nstatutory damages any time they encounter a transgender student using a facility barred by the \nlaw (i.e., in alignment with their gender identity).  That private right of action, coupled with a \nsubstantial quantum of statutory damages, encourages peers of transgender students to search \nthem out.  And it sends a message to Idaho youth that merely sharing the same communal space \nas a transgender student inherently harms other students.  That is, as a matter of fact and settled \nlaw, simply wrong.  See Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1228-29 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(“Plaintiffs allegedly feel harassed by the mere presence of transgender students in locker and \nbathroom facilities.  This cannot be enough [to state a claim for violation plaintiffs’ rights].”) \n4.  The exclusion of transgender youth from communal facilities matching their \ngender identity is deeply stigmatizing.  It also contravenes well-established standards of care for \nthe appropriate treatment of gender dysphoria, which is the clinically significant distress that can \nbe associated with the divergence between one’s gender identity and the sex one was assigned at \nbirth.  Treatment for gender dysphoria generally entails living in a manner consistent with one’s \ngender identity in all aspects of life—including using restrooms and related facilities that align \n  3 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 4 of 44\nwith that gender identity.  Prohibiting transgender youth from using those restrooms is nothing \nshort of depriving them of the medical care they need, and it will expose vulnerable Idaho youth \nto a range of serious health consequences including depression, anxiety, and suicidality.  \nFurthermore, depriving transgender students of equal access to facilities necessary for basic \nbodily functions can also lead to physical harms, from dehydration to infection (caused when \ntransgender youth avoid using restrooms that negate their gender identity—a documented and \ncommon phenomenon), and, further, rob them of equal access to the benefits of education.  And \nexcluding transgender youth from the facilities aligned with their gender identity can force them \nto come out to others every time they use, or explain to others why they cannot use, certain \nfacilities—causing transgender youth to disclose their transgender status involuntarily in \nsituations where they would otherwise keep that information private.  Such forcible outing will \nsubject these youth to an increased of risk of harassment and even bodily harm in violation of \ntheir basic right to privacy. \n5.  The Idaho Legislature exhibited callous disregard for these harms on transgender \nyouth in legislative proceedings.  It passed S.B. 1100 based on stereotypes, prejudice, and \nantipathy against transgender people, rather than any evidence that the law actually served any \nlegitimate purpose.  The political landscape leading to the law’s adoption was rife with \nvillainizing comments painting transgender people as threats, and the law was ultimately enacted \nbased on false and unsubstantiated assertions that it was necessary to stop sexual assault, \nmolestation, and rape.  In fact, as the bill’s supporters admitted, and as numerous experts agree, \nthere was and is no material evidence that allowing transgender students to use the facilities that \nmatch their gender identity has ever caused the harms the law purports to address.  Instead, it is \ntransgender students who face harm when exposed to greater risk of harassment and violence \n  4 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 5 of 44\nwhen forced to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity; when they are forced to out \nthemselves as transgender to fellow students who may not have otherwise known; and when they \nare not allowed to live in a manner consistent with the recommendations of health professionals.  \nThe Legislature failed to give any consideration to these realities.  Indeed, it passed the law a \nmere month after introduction, based entirely on animus and speculation. \n6.  The Legislature, further, acknowledged in its findings that federal courts have \nrepeatedly held that similar policies excluding transgender students from facilities matching their \ngender identity violate the Constitution.  It nevertheless refused to adhere to those rulings. \n7.  Unless enjoined by this Court, S.B. 1100 will irreparably harm transgender youth \nacross Idaho.  That includes Plaintiff Rebecca Roe, who is entering seventh grade, a pivotal time \nin adolescence, as well as members of Plaintiff Sexuality and Gender Alliance (“SAGA”), a \nstudent organization at Boise High School, whose transgender members stand in harm’s way.   \n8.  For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief, declaratory relief, as well as nominal damages resulting from Defendants’ discriminatory \nactions—to protect transgender people across the state, including Plaintiffs themselves, from the \ndevastating impact of S.B. 1100. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation of rights \nsecured by the United States Constitution under the color of state law, and under Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”). \n10.  This court has original subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343 because this action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Constitution of the United \nStates, and Title IX.  Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 6 of 44\n11.  Venue lies in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 as the Plaintiffs and \nDefendants are located in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the action occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Rebecca Roe (“Rebecca”) is a 12-year-old girl enrolled as a student \nwithin Boise School District.  Because Rebecca is transgender, S.B. 1100 bars her from using the \ngirls’ facilities at school.  Rebecca is a resident of Idaho and brings this action pursuant to \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 17(c) by and through her parents and next friends, Rachel and \nRyan Roe.  Rebecca, Rachel, and Ryan all proceed anonymously in this action.1 \n13.  Plaintiff Sexuality and Gender Alliance (“SAGA”), an unincorporated \nassociation, is a student organization at Boise High School, a public high school in the Boise \nSchool District for grades ten through twelve.

Gender identity is a well-established medical and psychological term that refers to \na person’s fundamental, deeply felt understanding of their own gender.  As the medical \ncommunity has long recognized, it is a core characteristic of human identity that everyone \npossesses.  There is also a medical consensus that gender identity is generally established at an \nearly age, although a person’s recognition of their gender identity can emerge at any time, and \nhas significant biological roots. \n21.  The phrase “sex assigned at birth” refers to the sex designation recorded on \nperson’s birth certificate, generally based on the appearance of external genitalia at birth.  While \nthe majority of people possess a gender identity that matches their sex assigned at birth, that is \n  8 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 9 of 44\nnot the case for transgender people, who are defined as transgender because their gender identity \ndoes not match their sex assigned at birth.  People whose gender identity is congruent with the \nsex they were assigned at birth are referred to as “cisgender” or non-transgender. \n22.  People who are transgender have a consistent, persistent, and insistent \nunderstanding that their sex is different from the sex they were assigned at birth.  People who are \ncisgender have a consistent, persistent, and insistent understanding that their sex is the same as \nthe sex they were assigned at birth.  \n23.  There is a medical consensus that efforts to change a person’s gender identity—\nincluding for the purpose of bringing that gender identity into alignment with a person’s sex \nassigned at birth—are not only ineffective, but unethical, and deeply harmful.  That consensus \nemerged after decades of harmful attempts to change transgender peoples’ identities through \ntherapies that consistently failed—and often resulted in depression and suicide. \n24.  A person possesses multiple sex-related characteristics including, but not limited \nto, chromosomal makeup, hormones, internal and external reproductive organs, secondary sex \ncharacteristics, and gender identity.  Medical experts who study human gender and sex, however, \nagree that gender identity is the single most important factor that determines a person’s sex, \nincluding where a person’s sex-related characteristics are not in typical alignment. \n25.  Discordance between one’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth can be \nassociated with clinically significant distress, which is known as gender dysphoria.  Gender \ndysphoria is a condition recognized by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition.  Without adequate treatment, gender \ndysphoria can result in profound psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal \nideation or self-harm. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 10 of 44\n26.  Treatment for gender dysphoria is governed by the internationally-recognized \nStandards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (“Standards of \nCare”), published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) \nsince 1980.  WPATH is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association of medical \nproviders, mental health providers, researchers, and others that promotes evidence-based care \nand research for transgender health.  WPATH published the eighth and most recent edition of the \nStandards of Care in 2022.  These standards are developed and continuously updated by the \nforemost experts in the field of transgender health based on a systematic review of the evidence-\nbased research on transgender health.  They are also recognized by other mainstream medical \norganizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychological \nAssociation, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. \n27.  In accordance with the Standards of Care, treatment for gender dysphoria consists \nof the person transitioning to living openly and being treated by others as the sex corresponding \nto the person’s gender identity.   \n28.  An essential part of that treatment is social transition, in which the individual lives \nin accordance with their gender identity in all aspects of life.  While the precise details are \nspecific to each person, social transition typically includes adopting a new first name, using and \nasking others to use pronouns reflecting the individual’s gender identity, wearing clothing \ntypically associated with that gender, and using sex-specific facilities corresponding to that \ngender.  At school, for example, transgender boys may appear indistinguishable from boys \nwhose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth (i.e., cisgender boys), and \ntransgender girls may appear indistinguishable from cisgender girls.   \n  10 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 11 of 44\n29.  To be effective at alleviating gender dysphoria, it is critical that social transition is \nrespected consistently across all aspects of a transgender individual’s life—for example, at home, \nin school, and at work.  Failing to recognize or respect a transgender person’s gender is contrary \nto established medical protocols and can exacerbate the symptoms of gender dysphoria. \n30.  In addition to social transition, medical treatments such as gender-affirming \nhormone therapy and surgical care may also be undertaken to facilitate transition and alleviate \ndysphoria by bringing a person’s body into greater typical alignment with their gender identity. \n31.  Psychotherapy to reduce the harmful effects of stigma that a transgender person \nmay have internalized regarding their identity may also be an important form of support for \nindividuals with gender dysphoria.  But it is not a substitute for social and medical transition as a \nmeans of treating gender dysphoria. \nII.  The Exclusion of Transgender People from Facilities Consistent with Their Gender \nIdentity Causes Well-Documented Harms. \n \n32.  In the United States, school and other public multiple-occupancy restrooms and \nlocker rooms are often separately designated for females and males.  So-called “bathroom bills” \nlike S.B. 1100 exclude transgender people from equal access to facilities matching their gender \nidentity.  In the context of schools, such bills require that a transgender student be treated as the \n“sex” that corresponds with their sex assigned at birth for purposes of facilities access, even \nwhen that student’s parents, health care professionals, teachers—and often peers—all recognize \nthat student as the sex that corresponds to their gender identity. \n33.  That exclusion—which is nothing short of a denial of that student’s true self—can \ncause a multitude of adverse mental and physical health consequences for transgender students.  \nThose include (1) interference with the process of social transition; (2) involuntary disclosure \nthat the student is transgender; (3) promotion of the view that there is something wrong with the \n  11 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 12 of 44\ntransgender student and that the transgender student does not belong in spaces used by \nclassmates, a view that can foster additional discrimination, harassment, and even violence; (4) \nnegative health consequences caused when transgender students try to avoid going to the \nrestroom; and (5) impairment of the student’s concentration and learning.  Together, such \nconsequences exacerbate the avoidable harms of gender dysphoria and lead to feelings of \nrejection, invalidation, isolation, shame, and stigmatization. \n34.  First, excluding transgender students from using facilities that align with their \ngender identity impairs and impedes a central component of the treatment for gender \ndysphoria—living in a manner consistent with one’s gender identity in all aspects of life.  \nTransgender people generally use restrooms consistent with their identity after completing other \naspects of social transition (e.g., wearing clothing typically associated with their gender, \nchanging their hair, and otherwise modifying their physical appearance to match their gender).  \nUsing such gender-affirming facilities is a significant part of a social transition—and an \nimportant step in treating the symptoms of gender dysphoria.  Expecting or requiring transgender \nstudents to use facilities that conflict with their gender identity can interfere with their treatment \nand even undermine the positive effects of socially transitioning in other aspects of life.  S.B. \n1000 thus exacerbates the symptoms of gender dysphoria, such as depression, anxiety, and \nsuicidal ideation, and damages a transgender person’s mental and physical health.  \n35.  Second, transgender youth are often subjected to victimization in the school \nenvironment, including bullying, physical assault, sexual assault, mistreatment, property \nvandalism, and other direct and indirect attacks.  Forcing transgender students to use facilities \ndiscordant with their gender identity can disclose the fact that they are transgender to other \nstudents and adults who may not have otherwise known and to whom the student may not have \n  12 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 13 of 44\notherwise disclosed that fact.  A transgender girl, for instance, who lives as female in all aspects \nof life, including school, may be forced to use the restroom designated for males, thereby \nrevealing to others that she is transgender.  This involuntary disclosure, in turn, increases the \nlikelihood of the transgender student being targeted for harassment and mistreatment, and \nincreases their fear of such victimization, with the accordant harms resulting from that stress. \n36.  Third, the many harms inflicted by excluding transgender people from the \nfacilities matching their gender identity cannot be avoided through purported “accommodations” \nthat relegate transgender people to using separate facilities from other students, such as a faculty, \nnurse, or single-user restroom.  As a practical matter, these alternate facilities are often located in \nless accessible areas and are not always open or available.  And consigning a transgender student \nto use of these alternate facilities ostracizes and segregates them from their fellow students: It \ncommunicates a message of disapproval to both the student and the school community that the \nstudent’s identity is not and should not be respected; that the student’s presence in a restroom \nfacility matching their gender identity represents a threat to others; and that transgender \nclassmates must be separated from everyone else because of who they are.  Such facilities are \nseparate and unequal in every respect. \n37.  Fourth, when transgender students lack equal access to facilities that match their \ngender identity—and are relegated to “alternate facilities” in less accessible areas—they often \navoid school restrooms, even for the entire length of the school day.  Such avoidance has \nnegative consequences for the student’s health, which can include urinary tract infections and \nkidney infections, as well as an adverse impact on the student’s ability to concentrate and access \nthe benefits of education.  Transgender students may also limit their food or fluid intake in an \n  13 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 14 of 44\nattempt to lessen their need to use the restroom, with the same ill consequences for their health \nand attention level. \n38.  Finally, educators and school administrators across the country also recognize that \nexcluding boys and girls who are transgender from multiple occupancy restrooms that align with \ntheir gender interferes with their ability to learn and thrive at school.  It impairs their ability to \ndevelop a healthy sense of self, peer relationships, and the cognitive skills necessary to succeed \nin adult life.  In light of these harms, the National Association of School Psychologists, National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals, National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, and the American School Counselor Association have all called upon schools to allow \nboys and girls who are transgender to use the same restrooms as their cisgender counterparts. \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Background \n  A.  Rebecca Roe \n39.  Plaintiff Rebecca Roe is a 12-year-old girl who has attended school within Boise \nSchool District since she was in kindergarten.  She will be attending seventh grade during the \n2023-24 academic year at a junior high school within Boise School District. \n40.  Rebecca enjoys playing video games, hanging out with friends at the mall, \nwatching anime shows, and doodling artwork.  She also takes kung fu lessons, both for physical \nexercise and potential self-defense. \n41.  Although Rebecca is now thriving as a transgender girl, her mental health \nsuffered in the past before she came to understand her gender identity better and received the \nsupport that she needed.  Rebecca’s parents became concerned about her mental well-being \naround the time she was in fourth grade.  She exhibited signs of depression and seemed generally \n  14 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 15 of 44\n“checked out.”  She also began falling behind in coursework even though she otherwise \ngenerally excels academically.   \n42.  During the summer after fourth grade, the issue of Rebecca’s gender arose in the \ncontext of a conversation with her parents regarding pride month for LGBTQ people.  Rebecca’s \nparents wanted to reassure her that they would still love her no matter who she was.  In the \ncourse of that conversation, Rebecca expressed to her parents that she did not believe that she \nwas a boy.  Rebecca’s parents were unsure of what to make of this information at the time. \n43.  In fifth grade, older students would sometimes pick on Rebecca, such as when \nthey saw her by herself during recess.  Overall, she struggled socially at school during fifth \ngrade, even though she also had a tight circle of friends. \n44.  Motivated by concerns about Rebecca’s well-being, Rebecca’s parents began \ntaking Rebecca to see a therapist to ensure that she received the mental health support she \nneeded.  During her therapy sessions, Rebecca expressed that she did not feel like a boy, \nconsistent with what she had conveyed to her parents during the summer after fourth grade.  The \ntherapist also spoke with Rebecca about any distress that she felt around issues related to gender. \n45.  Rebecca’s gender identity is female.  She has never felt typically masculine like \nothers assigned male at birth.  When she would look at her male friends, she would think to \nherself, “I don’t feel like this.”  When she would look at her female friends, however, she would \nthink to herself, “I feel more like that.” \n46.  After discussions between Rebecca, Rebecca’s therapist, and Rebecca’s parents, \nthe family decided to give Rebecca the opportunity to “be herself” for spring break in 2021, \nwhen Rebecca was not attending school, and to express her gender in the way that felt most \ncomfortable to her.  Rebecca went shopping and chose more typically feminine clothes for \n  15 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 16 of 44\nherself.  In contrast to the distress associated with gender dysphoria, Rebecca felt joy and relief \nwhen her gender expression matched her gender identity.  Rebecca’s parents noticed the \nimprovements in her mental health as well and that she seemed to be more confident in herself. \n47.  Following this experience, and particularly after the end of fifth grade, Rebecca \ncontinued the process of social transition to live in a manner consistent with her gender identity.  \nFor example, she began to use a more typically feminine name rather than a typically masculine \nname and asked others to use her new, female name; she dressed in clothes typically worn by \ngirls; she adopted a more feminine hairstyle; and she started using female pronouns. \n48.  Rebecca’s friends accepted and supported her as she undertook the process of \nsocial transition.  They respected her name and pronouns.  In addition, Rebecca’s name was also \nupdated in the school information system, and school staff respected her name and pronouns as \nwell.  Overall, Rebecca’s experience in sixth grade was significantly better than her experience \nin fifth grade because she was able to live in a manner consistent with her gender identity in \nseveral respects and was generally treated by her fellow students like other girls. \n49.  After Rebecca began her social transition, she also began using restrooms \ndesignated for females outside of school without incident.  Like other girls, she would enter the \nwomen’s restroom, go into a stall and close the door behind her, use the toilet, and then wash her \nhands and leave.  It was a routine practice that did not cause any problems for anyone, including \nothers using the restroom at the same time as her. \n50.  Rebecca has not used a restroom designated for males, whether at school or \noutside of school, since fifth grade.  Using the restrooms designated for males would feel wrong \nto Rebecca because she is a girl. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 17 of 44\n51.  When Rebecca is in public, she is generally perceived by others as female.  Thus, \nif she were to use the restroom designated for males, it would appear to others that a girl was \nusing the men’s restroom, something far more disruptive to social expectations than her use of \nthe women’s restroom.  As part of treatment for her gender dysphoria, Rebecca also receives \npuberty-delaying medication, which allows transgender adolescents to avoid physical changes \nassociated with their endogenous puberty, and can be followed by gender-affirming hormone \ntherapy where medically appropriate, which facilitates even greater alignment between one’s \ngender identity and body.  Living in a manner consistent with her gender identity, including \nhaving access to the girls’ restroom, is an important aspect of the treatment for Rebecca’s gender \ndysphoria. \n52.  Prior to the start of the sixth grade school year, it was initially envisioned that \nRebecca would use the nurse’s restroom rather than the boys’ restroom.  Rebecca ultimately did \nnot feel comfortable using the nurse’s restroom, however, because it felt stigmatizing and \nisolating to use in comparison to her female peers, who were not limited to using only that \nsingle-stall facility.  It was also in a less accessible location than the restrooms used by \nRebecca’s female classmates. \n53.  As a result, Rebecca generally avoided using the restroom at school.  She limited \nher fluid intake and would “hold it” at school to avoid using the restroom.  These measures were \nnot only unhealthy but they were increasingly difficult to endure as the school day progressed.   \nThey also created a physical and mental distraction while Rebecca was in class, as she spent her \ntime thinking to herself that she was “almost there” as she waited for the school day finally to \nend so that she could use the restroom at home. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 18 of 44\n54.  Rebecca will be attending a new school in seventh grade, alongside new \nclassmates, and she would like to fit in with her female classmates.  Rebecca’s parents have \nsignificant concerns about Rebecca’s physical safety, mental health, and her general well-being \nif she is ultimately excluded from girls’ facilities.  As parents who love their child and want to \nsee her thrive, they agonize that Rebecca’s use of the boys’ restroom, which may be unavoidable \nat times if she is excluded from the girls’ facilities, would expose her transgender status in \nsituations where it would otherwise remain private and leave her vulnerable to violence and \ntargeting by other students.  If Rebecca is only allowed to use either the boys’ restroom or a \nsingle-stall restroom, Rebecca is also afraid that any of her classmates at her new school could \nfind out that she is transgender, and she wishes to have control over her private information.   \n55.  The idea that Rebecca will be excluded from using facilities designated for girls is \npainful and stressful to her and makes her feel unequal to other girls.  It makes her feel like an \noutsider.  Her new school is also farther from home, making it even more difficult and unhealthy \nfor her to delay using the restroom until the end of the day.  Furthermore, living in a manner \nconsistent with her gender identity, including access to the girls’ restroom, is an important aspect \nof the treatment for Rebecca’s gender dysphoria, and at this stage in her social transition, \nRebecca wishes to use the girls’ restroom when she is outside the home, including at school, just \nlike other girls. \n  B.  SAGA \n56.  SAGA is a student organization for high school students at Boise High School. \nSAGA and its activities are led by students, and the organization meets weekly on school \ngrounds during the school year.  SAGA’s goals are to provide LGBTQ+ students and their allies \nwith support, resources, and information about events.  Part of SAGA’s mission is to make the \n  18 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 19 of 44\nschool environment a safe and welcoming place for LGBTQ+ students.  S.B. 1100 inflicts \nserious and ongoing harm against certain of SAGA’s members. \n57.  SAGA brings this action on behalf of its members harmed by S.B. 1100.  \n58.  Certain transgender SAGA members, consistent with school practices pre-dating \nS.B. 1100, wish to use multi-occupancy facilities on school grounds, including during the 2023-\n24 school year, consistent with their gender identity, and inconsistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth.  That includes those with a gender support plan, approved by the school and their parents, \nthat allows them to use multi-occupancy facilities consistent with their gender identity.  These \ngender support plans play an important role in transgender students’ mental and physical health, \nincluding their social transition.  Under S.B. 1100, transgender students would have to change \ntheir facilities use on campus by either using facilities that do not correspond to their gender \nidentity or by avoiding the use of multi-occupancy facilities altogether. \n59.  On their school campus, transgender SAGA members have inconsistent access to \none, single-stall, gender-neutral restroom in a building separate from most classrooms.  That \nrestroom is frequently unavailable either because it is occupied or closed.  It is also further from \nmost classrooms than the multi-occupancy restrooms, making it more difficult to access during \nshort breaks between classes.  \n60.  Any transgender SAGA member who is prohibited from using facilities consistent \nwith their gender identity under S.B. 1100 will be harmed by being treated differently than their \nclassmates who can use facilities consistent with their gender identity.  They will have to choose \nbetween using facilities inconsistent with their identity, causing distress and potential \nharassment, or avoiding facilities use, causing discomfort and potential health issues.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 20 of 44\n61.  Some members will face the risk of being outed as transgender under S.B. 1100, \nincluding in situations where they would not otherwise disclose their status, by having to change \ntheir established restroom use or by being forced to use restrooms inconsistent with their \nidentities (including the names and pronouns they use in the school community).  \n62.  S.B. 1100 is contrary to the mission of SAGA, which exists to support all \nmembers of the LGBTQ+ community and ensure that school is a safe and welcoming \nenvironment for them.  If S.B. 1100 remains in effect, SAGA will also have to spend additional \ntime supporting students that have lost restroom access and advocating for more gender-neutral \nrestroom options for students so they can make it through their school day.  Because SAGA does \nnot have the capacity to handle multiple projects at a time, this would interfere with its ability to \ncomplete other mission-driven student services, such as the clothing drive it has done in the past \nand would like to do again this year.  \nIV.  Idaho Enacted S.B. 1100 Without Any Evidence that It Furthers Privacy or Safety. \n \n  A.  Inclusive School Policies and Practices Had Been in Effect Long Before S.B.  \n    1100.   \n \n63.  For many years preceding the enactment of S.B. 1100, and at many schools across \nIdaho, transgender students have had the ability to access school facilities matching their gender \nidentity pursuant to inclusive policies and practices.  Collectively, these inclusive policies and \npractices have covered the educational experience of tens of thousands of Idaho students, \ncisgender and transgender alike, without causing harm. \n64.  Upon information and belief, at least 60 local educational agencies across Idaho, \nincluding school districts and charter schools, have adopted inclusive policies recognizing that, \nlike other students, transgender students must have the ability to access facilities that match their \ngender identity. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 21 of 44\n65.  Many of these policies were based on a model policy regarding sexual orientation \nand gender identity, Policy 3281, developed by the Idaho School Boards Association (“ISBA”) \nin 2015.  Policy 3281 sought to foster a safe educational environment for all students regardless \nof gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.  As relevant here, Policy 3281 \nspecified that students are allowed to use the facilities that correspond to the gender identity they \nconsistently assert at school, and that no student would be required to use facilities that conflict \nwith their gender identity.  It also recognized that any student, whether transgender or not, with a \nneed or desire for increased privacy could be given the option of a separate or private restroom \nor changing area.  Since Policy 3281 was issued, a significant number of school districts adopted \nit or implemented practices that align with it. \n66.  An increasing number of school districts nationwide, including those in Idaho, \nadopted inclusive policies and practices like Policy 3281 after the U.S. Department of Education \ntook various actions, beginning around 2010 and including a 2015 “Dear Colleague” letter from \nits Office of Civil Rights, that confirmed the obligation of schools to treat transgender students \nequally under federal law. \n67.  Some Idaho districts have also adopted inclusive policies or practices without \nnecessarily adopting Policy 3281 itself.  For example, since at least 2016 if not earlier, \ntransgender students in Boise School District have been able to work with their parents and \nschool staff to develop a written gender support plan.  The plan addresses topics such as student \nsafety, the name and gender marker to be used in the student’s school records, and the student’s \nuse of school restrooms and locker rooms.  Thus, a transgender boy, for example, is able to have \na gender support plan, signed by school staff, confirming his use of the boys’ facilities at school. \n  21 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 22 of 44\n68.  In 2016, Boise School District issued a public statement explaining that, “under \nfederal civil law, the District is required to provide access to public facilities consistent with the \nstudent’s gender identity.”  It further explained that, for purposes of facilities use, “Gender \nidentity is not a fluid concept.  A student may not choose to identify as male one day and a \nfemale the next.  School districts elsewhere that have implemented these policies require that the \ngender identification be both persistent and consistent over time.”  The District’s statement also \nrecognized that there was nothing mutually exclusive between providing transgender students \nwith access to facilities consistent with their gender identity, on the one hand, and “continu[ing] \nto provide safe and supportive school environments for all students, including transgender \nstudents,” on the other hand.  \n69.  Despite the widespread adoption of inclusive policies and practices in Idaho over \nthe last several years, there has been no evidence that such policies have caused any of the \npurported harms the Legislature lists in its “findings” as supposed justification for S.B. 1100.  \nSee 33-6601(4)2 (finding that “[r]equiring students to share restrooms and changing facilities \nwith members of the opposite biological sex generates potential embarrassment, shame, and \npsychological injury to students, as well as increasing the likelihood of sexual assault, \nmolestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism”). \n70.  The experiences of other jurisdictions are in accord.  For example, the District of \nColumbia Public Schools have provided transgender students with access to restroom and locker \nroom facilities consistent with their gender identity since 2006 and implemented the practice \n                                                           \n2 Citations to S.B. 1100 (referenced as 33-6601 to 33-607) are to Idaho Code, Title 33 Education, \nChapter 66 [67] Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public Schools. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 23 of 44\nthrough an official policy in 2015.  No school has reported any incident in which a cisgender \nstudent has been harmed because of the policy.   \n71.  In another example, the State of California enacted legislation in 2013 confirming \nthat students have the right to use restrooms and other facilities based on their gender identity.  \nThe Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest public school district in the country, \nhas had a similar policy in place even longer.  Millions of students have attended school under \nthese inclusive policies, and there is no evidence that providing transgender students with this \naccess has harmed any students. \n72.  Similarly, schools in countless other jurisdictions—including in Arizona, \nDelaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin—have successfully implemented \ninclusive policies and practices, without evidence of harm to students. \n  B.  In 2023, After Years of Inclusive Policies, the Idaho Legislature Proposed  \n    S.B. 1100. \n \n73.  Like numerous other Idaho school districts, on January 10, 2023, Caldwell School \nDistrict in central Idaho considered adopting an inclusive restroom policy.  The meeting abruptly \nended, however, after Senator Chris Trakel, who attended the school board meeting and \norchestrated opposition to the policy, asserted that the policy would risk children’s “moral \nhealth.”  When the board chair attempted to speak, Senator Trakel raised his voice, asserting that \n“he had the floor” at the local school board meeting.  Protesters then disrupted the meeting by \nyelling threats at board members, and district officials had to abruptly adjourn. \n74.  Other state officials also weighed in on the situation in Caldwell later that month.  \nIdaho Attorney General Raul Labrador, who had recently assumed office, took to Twitter to \n  23 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 24 of 44\ninterject his view in opposition to Caldwell School District’s potential adoption of an inclusive \npolicy recognizing transgender students’ equal right to access facilities matching their gender \nidentity, insisting that he needed to defend Idaho children.  He publicly attacked ISBA, a non-\nprofit organization founded in 1942 to serve school boards and members throughout Idaho, for \n“peddling” Policy 3281, through a January 25, 2023 letter that he also posted to Twitter.  He \nspecifically targeted transgender girls, whom he referred to as “biological boys,” and dismissed \ntransgender students’ “gender—along with potential gender dysphoria” as “choices.”  \n75.  In a January 30, 2023 letter, ISBA responded to the Attorney General that all of \nISBA’s model policies are drafted in-house and go through an intensive legal review process.  It \nconfirmed that its model policies are not based on any special interest group or entity, and that \nany legal questions about its policies are referred to outside legal counsel whose lawyers practice \neducation law and represent education clients throughout the state.  It explained that “Current \ninterpretation of Title IX – and likewise for Title VII – does protect discrimination on the basis \nof sex to include a person’s gender identity and sexual orientation.”  \n76.  ISBA also confirmed that “in places where these policies have been adopted and \noperating for many years, there have been no reported incidents of unlawful behavior.”  It \nexplained that its policies “assist school communities address practical issues that arise in their \nschools on a daily basis and require a clear, uniform and workable solution.” \n77.  On the heels of the situation in Caldwell, State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction Debbie Critchfield also wrote a letter dated January 19, 2023, to Senator Cindy \nCarlson to provide clarification and context regarding gender-related policies that address \nstudent facilities in public schools.  Senator Carlson responded that Superintendent Critchfield’s \noffice should take action to prevent enforcement of policies that protect transgender students’ use \n  24 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 25 of 44\nof facilities consistent with their gender identity, on the grounds that they were purportedly \ninconsistent with existing state law.  Senator Carlson closed her letter by declaring that “[w]e \nneed to send the message” about kids not being “indoctrinate[d]” with “this garbage.” \nC.   Legislative Proceedings Identify No Evidence That S.B. 1100 Protects Any \nStudent from Being Harmed in Any Respect. \n \n78.  On February 13, 2023, Senator Ben Adams introduced S.B. 1100 in the Idaho \nSenate.  Short- titled “Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public Schools,” the law \nwas widely referred to as the “Idaho bathroom bill.”  While S.B. 1100 has multiple provisions, as \ndetailed further below, its central provision is a statewide ban that excludes transgender students \nfrom school restrooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identity. \n79.  S.B. 1100 was drafted by the Idaho Family Policy Center, an organization that \nadvocates for public policy based on “biblical truths in sexuality and gender.”  Supporters of S.B. \n1100 expressed their disapproval of transgender people.  For example, Senator Trakel testified: \n“The Idaho Republican Party recognizes that children are a heritage of the Lord.  We believe \nbiological gender to be an essential characteristic of a child’s identity and purpose . . . We \nstrongly oppose any person, entity, or policy that attempts to confuse minors regarding their \nbio[logical] gender.”  Another supporter testified at the Education Committee that “God made \nmen and women . . . and eventually men and women made men’s and women’s bathrooms for \nmen and women,” and that “[W]e either have part A or part B.  Let’s keep it simple.” \n80.  In passing S.B. 1100, the Idaho Senate identified no reported incidents in Idaho of \ntransgender people committing acts of violence in public restrooms.  Instead, they resorted to \nspeculation.  For example, Senator Trakel hypothesized that the bill would prevent “some small \nchild” from otherwise being “molested or raped in the bathroom.”  To the contrary, opponents of \nS.B. 1100 explained that privacy and safety justifications were affirmatively disproven by the \n  25 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 26 of 44\nmany years that transgender students had been using facilities matching their gender identity.  \nEven legislators supporting S.B. 1100 conceded that they were not aware of any documented \ncase of a transgender person committing violence against a non-transgender person in a \nrestroom.  \n81.  The Senate also ignored testimony of youth who would be harmed by the law, \nincluding through the stigmatizing effect of being relegated, at best, to single-occupancy \nfacilities away from their peers if available.  A transgender student explained that the bill would \nfurther marginalize transgender students, perpetuate harmful mythologies that associate \ntransgender people with sexual deviance, and isolate the transgender community.   \n82.  Instead, although the Legislature would ultimately justify S.B. 1100 based on \npurported findings about protecting the privacy and safety of students, the actual legislative \nhistory included only unfounded speculation, contradicted by all the available evidence. \n83.  The bill emerged from committee with a “do pass” recommendation on a 6-2 \nvote.  On March 9, 2013, S.B. 1100 passed the full Senate on a 28-7 vote.  There was no \nmeaningful debate on the floor. \n84.  Proceedings in the House had a similar tenor as proceedings in the Senate.  \nSupporters of S.B. 1100 reprised unsubstantiated views that allowing transgender people to use \nfacilities aligning with their gender identity would lead to “predators” entering restrooms.  \nOpposing the bill, Representative Holli Woodings commented that “it’s not my understanding \nthat there’s been any documented cases of trans person violence on non-trans people?” with \nwhich Representative Edward Hill, who supported S.B. 1100, agreed. \n85.  On March 16, 2023, S.B. 1100 passed the full House on 59-10-1 vote, sponsored \nby Representative Hill.  There was no debate.   \n  26 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 27 of 44\n86.  Governor Brad Little then signed S.B. 1100 on March 22, 2023.  With scant \nlegislative deliberation, it took just over one month from the bill’s introduction to its signing. \n87.  During the same session, the Legislature also enacted other anti-LGBTQ laws, \nincluding a criminal prohibition against providing transgender youth with medically necessary \ngender-affirming healthcare. \nD.  S.B. 1100’s Provisions and Purported Justifications \n88.  S.B. 1100, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1, defines “sex” as the \n“immutable biological and physiological characteristics, specifically the chromosomes and \ninternal and external reproductive anatomy, genetically determined at conception and generally \nrecognizable at birth, that define an individual as male or female.”  33-6602(3).   \n89.  In other words, under S.B. 1100’s definition of sex, a transgender person is a \nmember of the “sex” that is the opposite of their gender identity.  But that definition ignores the \nscientific and medical consensus that recognizes that gender identity is the critical determinant of \nsex where gender identity diverges from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.  Indeed, the \nLegislature’s definition of sex was constructed in order to deny transgender people recognition \nof their gender. \n90.  Based on its definition of “sex,” S.B. 1100 requires that every public school \nmultiple-occupancy restroom or changing facility must be designated for use by male persons \nonly or female persons only, and used only by members of that “sex,” and prohibits any person \nfrom entering these facilities unless they are of the designated “sex.”  33-6603(1).  S.B. 1100 \nalso mandates that public schools must “ensure that all restrooms and changing facilities provide \nits users with privacy from members of the opposite sex.”  33-6603(2).  \n  27 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 28 of 44\n91.  In addition to imposing a statewide mandate, S.B. 1100 also creates a private right \nof action that places a “bounty” on the heads of transgender students and encourages peers to \nsearch them out.  Any student who encounters someone of the “opposite sex” in covered \nfacilities may obtain statutory damages of at least $5,000, in addition to damages for any harm \npurportedly experienced, and attorneys’ fees for the school’s non-compliance with the terms of \nS.B. 1100.  33-6606.  By creating this right of action, the Legislature sent a clear message: A \ncisgender student sharing a restroom with a transgender student—even for a brief moment—\nshould receive thousands of dollars as a reward for reporting that they were in the vicinity of a \ntransgender person using facilities consistent with their gender identity. \n92.  Although S.B. 1100 lays out various exemptions where its provisions do not \napply—notwithstanding the law’s assumption that access to sex-designated facilities by members \nof the “opposite sex” causes harm—none of these exemptions provide transgender students with \nequal access to facilities matching their gender identity as compared to their cisgender peers.  \nOne of these exemptions permits coaching staff and personnel to enter otherwise prohibited \nfacilities specifically during athletic events—which legislative proceedings indicated was to \nfacilitate a halftime “pep talk”—notwithstanding purported concerns about privacy. \n93.  Similarly, while S.B. 1100 requires that schools provide purported “reasonable \naccommodations” to anyone who provides a written request detailing that they are “unwilling or \nunable” to use the multi-occupancy facilities designated for the person’s “sex,” it makes clear \nthat this does not include access to facilities “designated for use by members of the opposite sex \nwhile persons of the opposite sex are present or could be present.”  33-6605.  When transgender \npeople are relegated to alternate “accommodations,” they are often inferior to the facilities used \nby others, located in less accessible locations, and stigmatizing for them to use. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 29 of 44\n94.  While S.B. 1100 targets transgender students, its provisions also apply to other \ntransgender people as well, such as school staff or a student’s siblings or parents who are \ntransgender and may need to use school facilities while on campus.  \n95.  Additionally, S.B. 1100 provides that for any school-sponsored events with \novernight lodging, no person may share sleeping quarters, a restroom, or a changing facility with \na person of the “opposite sex” unless they are members of the same family.  33-6603(4).  Thus, \nfor example, if four students generally stay in one hotel room for a school trip, a transgender \nstudent may be forced to stay in a room without any other students, causing them to feel isolated \nand stigmatized and depriving them of the same social bonding that other students experience. \n96.  S.B. 1100 was enacted on a foundation of imagined fears and stereotypes that \ntransgender people are predators from whom children must be shielded—rather than a \nrecognition that transgender people are friends, neighbors, relatives, and members of the \ncommunity entitled to equal dignity and respect. \n97.  These impermissible motivations are reflected in S.B. 1100 itself.  While couched \nin terms of “privacy and safety,” lawmakers targeted transgender students, and their use of \nfacilities matching their gender identity, as purportedly “increasing the likelihood of sexual \nassault, molestation, rape, voyeurism, and exhibitionism” and causing “potential embarrassment, \nshame, and psychological injury to students.”  33-6601(2-5). \n98.  These purported justifications are baseless and unsupported.  There is no evidence \nto substantiate that transgender people who use facilities associated with their gender identity are \nmore likely to harm others compared to their non-transgender peers. \n99.  There is also no evidence to substantiate that inclusive policies or practices cause \ncisgender people to pretend to be transgender and thereby engage in misconduct that would not \n  29 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 30 of 44\notherwise occur.  Such misconduct is already directly barred by other prohibitions, and nothing \nabout an inclusive policy alters that reality.  In stark contrast, it is transgender people who are \nmore likely to be harassed, mistreated, or assaulted in facilities, particularly where they are \nforced to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity. \n100.  In addition, transgender people using facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity does not intrude on others’ reasonable expectations of privacy in those facilities.  The \nLegislature failed to identify any evidence to support this claim during legislative proceedings, \neven though inclusive policies and practices have existed in many Idaho schools for years.  For \nexample, there is no evidence indicating that transgender people are any more likely to \nunnecessarily expose themselves to others than non-transgender people.  To the contrary, \ntransgender people often take steps to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to themselves and \nthereby reduce the risk of harassment. \n101.  Merely sharing the same physical space as transgender people does not infringe \nupon the privacy of cisgender people.  There are also measures that can be undertaken to \nincrease privacy for anyone desiring additional privacy, transgender or not, without excluding \ntransgender people from facilities matching their gender identity. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Equal Protection \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n(Against Defendants Critchfield, Clark, Gilbert Jr., Hill, Keough, Liebich, Roach, Siddoway, \nDennis, Wagers, Greeley, Gregory, Langley, Oppenheimer, and Rajbhandari) \n  30 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 31 of 44\n102.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations above as though \nfully set forth herein. \n103.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants in their official capacities \nfor purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenging S.B. 1100 facially and \nas applied. \n104.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no State shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  Defendants are all \ngovernmental actors and/or employees acting under color of state law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n105.  S.B. 1100 facially and intentionally discriminates against transgender people like \nPlaintiffs based on sex-related considerations.  Discrimination based on sex includes but is not \nlimited to discrimination based on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, \ngender transition, and nonconformity to sex-based stereotypes.   \n106.  S.B. 1100 engages in sex-based classification by limiting access to school \nrestrooms and other facilities based on sex assigned at birth, even where such facilities are \ninconsistent with an individual’s gender identity.  S.B. 1100 also discriminates against \ntransgender people based on sex by imposing harmful differential treatment on those who fail to \nconform to the stereotypes associated with their sex assigned at birth.  The assumption that \nsomeone’s gender identity will and should align with their sex assigned at birth is a sex-based \nstereotype.  S.B. 1100 discriminates against individuals who fail to conform to this stereotype—\nwhich the medical community has long understood is not true for all individuals.  For example, \nalthough S.B. 1100 denies Plaintiff Rebecca Roe access to girls’ restrooms because her female \n  31 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 32 of 44\ngender identity does not conform to her sex assigned at birth, a cisgender peer whose female \nidentity does conform to her sex assigned at birth can use girls’ restrooms.  \n107.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination \nbased on sex is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to heightened scrutiny. \n108.  S.B. 1100 facially and intentionally discriminates against transgender people like \nPlaintiffs based on transgender status.  S.B. 1100 classifies based on transgender status by \nprohibiting transgender people from using school restrooms and other facilities that align with \ntheir gender identity, while permitting cisgender students to use school restrooms and other \nfacilities that align with their gender identity.  In other words, it treats people differently solely \nbased on whether their assigned sex at birth aligns with their gender identity: if it does, they may \nuse the facilities that correspond to their sex; if it does not, they may not.  That is discrimination \non the basis of transgender status. \n109.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, any \ndiscrimination based on transgender status is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to \nheightened scrutiny.  Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200 (9th Cir. 2019).  Government \ndiscrimination against transgender people bears all the indicia of a classification requiring \nheightened scrutiny by the courts. \na.  Transgender people have long been victims of extreme discrimination \nacross the country, including in Idaho, and continue to suffer such discrimination to this day. \nb.  Transgender status and gender identity bear no relation to one’s ability to \ncontribute to society. \nc.  Transgender people are politically vulnerable to attack and lack sufficient \npower to adequately protect their rights through the legislative process.  Transgender people have \n  32 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 33 of 44\nbeen unable, in large measure, to secure explicit federal, state, and local protections to protect \nthemselves against discrimination, and they have been and continue to be regularly targeted by \nanti-transgender legislation, regulations, bills, and other government action. \nd.  Gender identity is a core, defining trait, and is so fundamental to one’s \nidentity and conscience that a person cannot be required to abandon it as a condition of equal \ntreatment.  Gender identity is also generally fixed at an early age and cannot be voluntarily \nchanged.  Thus, transgender status is immutable. \n110.  S.B. 1100 treats transgender people differently and worse than cisgender people \nwho are similarly situated.  Under S.B. 1100, cisgender people are able to access restrooms and \nother sex-specific facilities consistent with their gender identity, but transgender people are \nbanned from restrooms and other sex-specific facilities consistent with their gender identity. \n111.  S.B. 1100 deprives transgender people such as Plaintiffs of their right to equal \nprotection by branding them as less worthy than their cisgender peers. \n112.  S.B. 1100’s discrimination against transgender people based on sex and \ntransgender status fails every level of scrutiny.  It is not substantially related to an important \ngovernment interest.  It is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest.  \nSchools across the nation, and in Idaho, regularly allow transgender students to use restrooms \nthat align with their gender identity without causing increased safety or privacy problems for any \nstudents. \n113.  Far from advancing any interest in safety or privacy, S.B. 1100 endangers the \nsafety, privacy, and well-being of transgender people.  For example, if a transgender girl were \nforced to use the boys’ restroom, she would be exposed to a heightened risk of harassment and \nassault by students who believe that she should not be in the boys’ restroom, even though that is \n  33 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 34 of 44\nthe facility aligned with her “sex” as defined by S.B. 1100.  Alternatively, forcing transgender \nstudents to only use single-occupancy or other “reasonable accommodation” facilities will \nstigmatize them as “others,” similarly exposing them to a heightened risk of harassment and \nassault and jeopardizing their psychological health. \n114.  In enacting S.B. 1100, the Legislature disguised conclusory allegations rooted in \nbias and misunderstanding as “legislative findings” that lack any factual support.  But rather than \nadvancing any legitimate governmental interest, S.B. 1100’s requirement that transgender \nstudents use facilities incongruent with their gender identity communicates the State’s \ndisapproval of their gender identity, which the Constitution and federal law protect.   \n115.  For example, the Legislature deemed every student to have a “natural right to \nprivacy in the bathroom,” but that right to privacy cannot create—and has been held not to by the \nNinth Circuit—any right on the part of cisgender students not to share a restroom with \ntransgender individuals.   Parents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at 1228. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of Title IX \n20 U.S.C. § 1681 \n(Against Defendants Idaho Board of Education and Boise School District) \n116.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations above as though \nfully set forth herein. \n117.  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a).  Title IX’s prohibitions on sex discrimination extend to “any academic, extracurricular, \n  34 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 35 of 44\nresearch, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient” of \nfederal funding.  34 C.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.400; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n118.  Under Title IX, discrimination “on the basis of sex” encompasses discrimination \nbased on gender nonconformity, gender identity, transgender status, gender transition, and \nnonconformity to sex-based stereotypes.   \n119.  Conduct specifically prohibited under Title IX includes, inter alia, treating one \nperson differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or \ncondition for the provision of aid, benefits, or services; providing different aid, benefits, or \nservices in a different manner; denying any person any such aid, benefit, or service; or otherwise \nsubjecting any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment.  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.31; 7 C.F.R. § 15a.31; 45 C.F.R. § 86.31. \n120.  The public schools that Plaintiffs attend are education programs receiving federal \nfinancial assistance.  This means the schools, including the academic, extracurricular, and other \neducational opportunities provided, are subject to Title IX’s prohibitions on sex- and gender-\nbased discrimination against any student. \n121.  By prohibiting transgender people like Plaintiffs from using the same restrooms \nand other facilities that their cisgender peers are allowed to use, Defendants have and continue to \nexclude Plaintiffs from participation in, deny them the benefits of, and subject them to \ndiscrimination in education programs and activities at their respective schools “on the basis of \nsex.”  This violates Plaintiffs’ rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681.  For example, Defendants violate Rebecca Roe’s rights under Title IX by barring \nher from using the same girls’ restrooms that every other girl is allowed to use and relegating her \nto separate restroom facilities. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 36 of 44\n122.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ Title IX rights has caused injury and damage \nas a result, for which they seek nominal damages of $1 (only as to their Title IX claim). \nCOUNT III \nViolation of Right to Privacy \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n(Against Defendants Critchfield, Clark, Gilbert Jr., Hill, Keough, Liebich, Roach, Siddoway, \nDennis, Wagers, Greeley, Gregory, Langley, Oppenheimer, and Rajbhandari) \n123.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations above as though \nfully set forth herein. \n124.  Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants in their official capacities \nfor purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenging Idaho’s S.B. 1100 \nfacially and as applied. \n125.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no State shall “deprive any \nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  \nDefendants are all governmental actors and/or employees acting under color of state law for \npurposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n126.  The substantive protections of the Due Process Clause, as well as other \nconstitutional provisions, give rise to a right to privacy, protecting information that is highly \npersonal and intimate, which includes information that could lead to bodily harm upon \ndisclosure.  Government infringement of these protections requires courts to apply strict scrutiny \nto such government action. \n  36 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 37 of 44\n127.  The involuntary disclosure of a person’s transgender status violates that person’s \nfundamental right to privacy.  The fact that a person is transgender constitutes highly personal \nand intimate information.  A reasonable person would find the involuntary disclosure of one’s \ntransgender status to be deeply intrusive. \n128.  The involuntary disclosure of one’s transgender status can also cause significant \nharm, including placing one’s personal safety and bodily integrity at risk.  This harm burdens \nand interferes with the ability of transgender persons to live in a manner consistent with their \ngender identity in all aspects of life, including where doing so is medically necessary. \n129.  S.B. 1100 violates the fundamental right to privacy of transgender people, \nincluding Plaintiff Rebecca Roe and members of Plaintiff SAGA, by causing the involuntary \ndisclosure of their transgender status and by depriving them of significant control over the \ncircumstances around such disclosure. \n130.  There are no adequate safeguards to prevent the harms of the involuntary \ndisclosure of one’s transgender status caused by S.B. 1100.  For example, once other students \nlearn of the fact that a student is transgender, nothing prevents those students from disclosing \nthat information to others. \n131.  There is no compelling, important, or even legitimate interest in the government \ncausing transgender people such as Rebecca Roe to disclose their transgender status involuntarily \nany time they need to use school facilities.  There is also no public policy interest that is served \nby causing transgender people to disclose their transgender status to third parties where they \nwould not otherwise do so. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 1   Filed 07/06/23   Page 38 of 44\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that proper process issue and be served upon Defendants, \nrequiring them to answer the Complaint within the time prescribed by law and further Plaintiffs \nrequest an order and judgment: \n132.

INTRODUCTION  \nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”). \nDkt.  34.  Defendants  oppose  the  motion.  Dkt.  39.  Because  oral  argument  would  not \nsignificantly aid its decision-making process, the Court will decide the motion on the \nbriefing. Dist. Idaho Loc. Civ. R. 7.1(d)(1)(B). For the reasons below, the Court GRANTS \nthe Motion and will issue a TRO until further notice. \nII. BACKGROUND \nOn July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the above-entitled civil rights action challenging \nIdaho Senate Bill 1100 (“S.B. 1100”). Dkt. 1. S.B. 1100 was adopted on March 22, 2023, \ntook effect on July 1, 2023, and requires, among other things, that students in Idaho public \nschools use the bathroom or locker room that corresponds with his or her biological sex, \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 1 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 2 of 9\ni.e. the person’s sex assigned at birth. Plaintiffs allege this law is unconstitutional and \ndisproportionately harms students who identify as transgender. \nAlongside their Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Proceed Anonymously (Dkt. \n13)1 and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 15) (“PI Motion”). Defendants then \nfiled a Motion for Extension of Time requesting an approximately 60-day extension to \nrespond to Plaintiffs’ PI Motion. Dkt. 21. The Court partially granted the request, extended \nthe briefing deadlines, and set the PI Motion for a hearing on September 13, 2023. Dkt. 31. \nNotably, in their opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Extension, Plaintiffs argued \nthe Court could grant the extension, but if it did, it should also take other actions to protect \nPlaintiffs’ rights in the interim—such as sua sponte issuing a TRO. Dkt. 25, at 3–4. In its \nDecision, the Court noted that while it could take various actions to accomplish certain \ngoals, it would not do so of its own accord. Dkt. 31, at 4 (explaining it would not take any \nfurther action “sua sponte”).  \nOn July 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for TRO, in which they formally \nask the Court to do what they previously suggested the Court could do sua sponte: issue a \nTRO until the Court’s scheduled hearing and decision on the PI Motion. Dkt. 34.   \nLike their prior suggestion that the Court act sua sponte, Plaintiffs suggest in their \npresent Motion that the Court can issue a TRO without a response from Defendants. Dkt. \n34-1, at 3, 7.2 While this is true, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b), the Court strongly prefers to hear \n \n1 The Court recently granted this motion. Dkt. 38. \n \n2 Plaintiffs recognized, however, that the Court would likely want a response from Defendants. Dkt. 34-1, \nat 7 n.1.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 2 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 3 of 9\nfrom both sides on any issue when feasible. Here, Defendants asked the Court to give them \na short time to respond. Dkt. 35. The Court obliged and set an expedited briefing schedule. \nDkt. 36. The Court also asked the parties to focus on the “status quo” question in their \nbriefing as that would likely be its “main focus in determining Plaintiffs’ TRO Motion.” \nDkt. 37.  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA  preliminary  injunction  and  a  TRO  generally  serve  the  same  purpose  of \n“preserv[ing] the status quo ante litem pending a determination of the action on the merits.” \nLos Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th \nCir. 1980); Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction or TRO “must establish [1] that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.” CTIA-The Wireless Ass’n v. City of Berkeley, 854 F.3d \n1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008)). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nAlthough the issues in this case are “complex” and “weighty,” Dkt. 31, at 4, the \nquestion today is relatively simple: what is the status quo that must be preserved pending \nresolution of Plaintiffs’ PI Motion?  \nThe 2023-2024 school year begins next week, on August 16, 2023. Plaintiffs request \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 3 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 4 of 9\nthat the Court enter a TRO prohibiting S.B. 1100 from going into effect3 until the Court \nissues a full ruling on the PI Motion. Dkt. 34. They contend a short, prohibitory TRO will \npreserve the status quo and prevent harm. Defendants oppose the request, arguing the TRO \nPlaintiffs are requesting is mandatory and will change, rather than preserve, the status quo.   \nDefendants are incorrect on both fronts. \nBoth sides admit that prior to S.B. 1100 being adopted by the Idaho Legislature—\nand long before it went into effect last month—there was a patchwork of regulations and \nrules concerning which students could use which restrooms4 in Idaho schools. Dkt. 39, at \n2; Dkt. 40, at 2. Some school districts (approximately 75% of the 115 school districts in \nIdaho)  maintained  rules  mandating  sex-separate  restrooms,  changing  facilities,  and \novernight accommodations. Dkt. 39-1, at 2. A smaller percentage (25%) had policies in \nplace that allowed for individuals to use facilities consistent with their chosen gender \nidentity.  \nThen S.B. 1100 passed. S.B. 1100 requires that schools mandate students use \nrestrooms consistent with their biological sex.   \nBecause of this, Defendants assert the status quo the Court must maintain is sex-\nseparate bathrooms. But this is not accurate. The relevant “status quo” for purposes of an \ninjunction  “refers  to  the  legally  relevant  relationship  between  the  parties  before  the \ncontroversy arose.” Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir. \n \n3 Like most bills in Idaho, S.B. 1100 became law on July 1, 2023. That said, because no public school \ndistricts have yet to go back into session, it is not really “in effect” yet.    \n  \n4 For ease, the Court will consistently refer just to restrooms, but S.B. 1100 also encompasses locker rooms, \novernight accommodations etc.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 4 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 5 of 9\n2014) (emphasis in original); see also Regents of Univ. of California v. Am. Broad. \nCompanies, Inc., 747 F.2d 511, 514 (9th Cir. 1984) (for purposes of injunctive relief, the \nstatus quo means “the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy”) \n(cleaned up). In this suit, Plaintiffs contests the enforceability and constitutionality of S.B. \n1100. The status quo, therefore, is the policy in Idaho prior to S.B. 1100’s passage and \nenactment.5  \nSo even though some school districts did, in fact, have policies separating bathroom \nusage, others did not. Thus, while S.B. 1100 may “codify[] the common practice,” of sex-\nseparate bathrooms, Dkt. 39, at 2, that does not mean the new law is the status quo. Simply \nput, the status quo concerning bathroom usage in Idaho schools was diverse; but no law, \nno restriction, and no mandate dictated those policies. In other words, keeping the status \nquo at this stage is doing just that: leaving schools to their own devices without any input \nfrom the state of Idaho, and without any formal regulations one way or the other.  \nReviewing what would happen if the Court ruled the other way helps see why this \nmust be the case. If the Court were to allow S.B. 1100 to go into full force and effect, it \nwould require all schools to adopt the sex-separated policy. Doing this would not be a \nchange for some schools and would be a change for others. But the mere fact that S.B. 1100 \n \n5 The Court finds the timing of Plaintiffs’ lawsuit does not change is analysis. See Aggarao v. MOL Ship \nMgmt. Co., 675 F.3d 355, 378 (4th Cir. 2012) (“The status quo to be preserved by a preliminary injunction \n[] is not the circumstances existing at the moment the lawsuit or injunction request was actually filed, but \nthe last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.”) (cleaned up); GoTo.com, \nInc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1210 (9th Cir. 2000) (“The status quo ante litem refers not simply \nto any situation before the filing of a lawsuit, but instead to the last uncontested status which preceded the \npending controversy.”) (cleaned up). The last uncontested status in this case between these two parties was \nthe landscape before S.B. 1100 passed. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 5 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 6 of 9\ndictates a state-wide policy is the change that upends the status quo of there not being a \npolicy in the first instance. Asking school districts to implement this specific regime would \nchange the school-by-school status quo that has been in place for numerous years.   \nThis dovetails into the difference between a prohibitory injunction and a mandatory \ninjunction. The Court turns to that issue next.   \nA prohibitory injunction preserves the status quo by preventing a party from taking \nsome action before a determination on the merits of the action. Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. \nv. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 878-79 (9th Cir. 2009). See also Heckler v. \nLopez, 463 U.S. 1328, 1333 (1983) (a prohibitory injunction “freezes the positions of the \nparties until the court can hear the case on the merits”). By contrast, a mandatory injunction \n“orders a responsible party to take action.” Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 484 \n(1996). Because mandatory injunctions “go[ ] well beyond simply maintaining the status \nquo,” they are “particularly disfavored” and subject to a heightened burden of proof. \nMarlyn Nutraceuticals, 571 F. 3d at 879. See also Diamond House of SE Idaho v. City of \nAmmon, 381 F. Supp. 3d 1262, 1270 (D. Idaho 2019). \nBy granting the TRO today, the Court is not mandating or requiring that school \ndistricts in Idaho do anything—including adopt policies that would allow students to use \nrestrooms that coincide with their gender identity. Nor is it requiring Defendants to do \nanything. It is simply prohibiting, for the time being, the enforcement of a new State-wide \nlaw and allowing the continuation of school-by-school imposition of policies.  \nIn sum, the Court finds that the status quo was the legal landscape before S.B. 1100 \nwas passed, and that landscape did not require sex-separate or sex-inclusive restrooms. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 6 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 7 of 9\nEach school district was free to implement its own policies or regulations. That system \ncontinues today.  \nNow, the Court recognizes that, when deciding a TRO, it should look at the standard \nWinter factors6 “not merely on preservation of the status quo.” Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n v. \nCity & Cnty. of San Francisco, 512 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). The \nconundrum in this case—like many cases where competing constitutional rights are at \nstake—is that both sides allege factors two, three, and four lean their way. Both contend \nthe equities tip in their favor, that the public interest supports their view, and that they will \neach suffer future harm if the Court does not rule as they suggest. Without delving \nsubstantively into the parties’ respective arguments, the Court simply notes these three \nfactors are roughly even. The Court concludes its review of the Winter factors with factor \none—a likelihood of success on the merits.  \nAs the Court has noted elsewhere, a Plaintiff’s ability to demonstrate “a likelihood \nof success on the merits, or serious questions going to the merits, is the most important \nelement of a preliminary injunction.” Perlot v. Green, 609 F. Supp. 3d 1106, 1126 (D. \nIdaho 2022) (citing Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) \n(cleaned up). This showing, however, is only preliminary because the parties have typically \nnot engaged in any discovery by the time a preliminary injunction motion is filed. A TRO \nthat precedes a PI, such as this, is even more removed from the merits and substance of the \n \n6 These factors include: (1) A likelihood of success on the merits; (2) likely irreparable harm in the absence \nof a preliminary injunction; (3) that the balance of equities weighs in favor of an injunction; and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 7 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 8 of 9\ncase.7 Said another way, at this point the Court is effectively tasked with trying to make a \npre-preliminary call on the prospects of Plaintiffs’ claims. It cannot do so at this time with \nany degree of certainty.  \nNotably, there is already a circuit split on the issues raised in this case. The Fourth \nCircuit has decided that denying gender-affirming bathroom access can violate both Title \nIX and the Equal Protection Clause, while the Eleventh Circuit found no violations based \non substantially similar facts. Compare Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 \nF.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020), with Adams ex rel. Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, \n57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc). And just last week, the Seventh Circuit effectively \njoined the Fourth Circuit when it upheld preliminary injunctions entered in two district \ncourt cases dealing with these same issues. See A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of \nMartinsville, 2023 WL 4881915 (7th Cir. Aug. 1, 2023).  \nCandidly, against this divided backdrop, the Court does not know if Plaintiffs will \nbe able to show success on the merits or not at the upcoming hearing. Hence the Court’s \nfocus today on the status quo. Ultimately, the Court finds the Winter factors do not tip \nstrongly one way or the other. The Court does find, however, that preserving the status quo \npending a more complete review is the most fitting approach at the current juncture.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n  Today, the Court puts a pause on S.B. 1100. It does not find it unconstitutional. It \n \n7 For example, in this case, Defendants’ deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ PI Motion (and Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint) is still weeks away. Limited discovery has taken place in the form of retained experts and \nreports, but again, the Court only has those from Plaintiffs.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 8 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 44   Filed 08/10/23   Page 9 of 9\ndoes not find it constitutional. This is not a full adjudication of any argument on the merits. \nThe Court is simply holding S.B. 1100 in abeyance and preserving the situation as it existed \nprior to the parties’ disagreement, which is that S.B. 1100 will not be in effect when school \nstarts on August 16, 2023. School districts may choose how to organize their bathrooms, \nchanging  facilities,  and  overnight  accommodations—whether  that  is  sex-separate  or \ntransgender-inclusive; whether it is consistent with what it did last year or not. But the State \nof Idaho will not be mandating that decision at this time.   \nVI. ORDER \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Dkt. 34) is GRANTED. \n2.  The provisions of S.B. 1100 are held in abeyance until the Court has an opportunity \nto rule on the merits of this action.   \n3.  The TRO will last until the Court issues a decision on Plaintiffs’ PI Motion unless \nordered otherwise.  \n \n  DATED: August 10, 2023 \n \n \n \n  _________________________            \nDavid C.

The Court held oral argument on September 13, 2023, and took both motions \nunder advisement.  \nUpon review, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ PI \nMotion  and  DENIES  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss.  There  will  be  no  preliminary \ninjunction and Idaho’s statute will soon take effect because Plaintiffs have not met their \nburden for an injunction. That said, the case will move forward because Defendants have \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 1 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 2 of 37\nnot met their burden for dismissal either. \nII. OVERVIEW \n  This is a difficult case. Each of the parties before the Court seek to protect important \nindividual rights. The critical question, however, is what happens when individuals’ rights \nconverge and those rights struggle to co-exist? As the Court has explained before, “much \ncan be said about the intersection, and overlapping nature, of these rights and the degree to \nwhich one right impacts another.” Perlot v. Green, 609 F. Supp. 3d 1106, 1111 (D. Idaho \n2022). Today, the Court is again faced with “tackling the difficult interplay between \nvarious [] rights.” Id. In doing so, it is ever “cognizant of the fact that in enforcing or \nprotecting certain rights, other rights may be impinged.” Id.  \n  The outcome of cases such as this are celebrated by some and lamented by others. \nRegardless of the Court’s ruling today, someone will feel left out. In a pluralistic society, \nhowever, everyone cannot win every time. There must be reasonable give and take and \nsensible people on all sides of the issue should work together in a collaborative effort.  \nThe present task is particularly difficult considering the communities on both sides \nof the debate are some of Idaho’s most vulnerable: children and youth. Although it likely \ncomes as little solace to Idaho’s transgender students who, as a result of the Court’s \ndecision today, may have to change their routines, or who, regrettably, may face other \nsocietal hardships, the Court must stay within its lane. Its duty is to interpret the law; it is \nnot a policy-making body. As such, the Court cannot say which approach is best. It can \nonly decide whether the approach chosen by the Idaho Legislature is legal. And, in the \ncontext of a preliminary injunction such as this, the question is even more nuanced since \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 2 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 3 of 37\nthe Court’s analysis is preliminary. Today, the Court reviews the challenged law and asks \nthis simple question: have Plaintiffs convinced the Court the law is likely unconstitutional? \nThe answer is no.  \n  The Court, of course, does not assess this simple question in a vacuum. It is mindful \nthat its “technical” legal decisions have real-world consequences. However, when the \nCourt runs too far afield and starts to “write” the law or suggest what the law should be to \nachieve certain societal goals, it has overstepped.  \nFor the reasons explained herein, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not met their burden \nto obtain a preliminary injunction at this stage of the proceedings. As such, the law \nPlaintiffs challenge may go into effect. Additionally, the Court finds Defendants have not \nmet their burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and will not dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims in their entirety.  \nIII. BACKGROUND \nOn March 22, 2023, the Idaho Legislature adopted Idaho Senate Bill 1100 (“S.B. \n1100” or “the Bill”). On July 1, 2023, S.B. 1100 went into effect. S.B. 1100 requires, \namong other things, that students in Idaho public schools use the bathroom or locker room \nthat  corresponds  with  their  biological  sex.  Similar  regulations  apply  to  overnight \naccommodations. Before S.B. 1100, school districts were free to regulate these issues as \neach deemed fit. Roughly 25% of school districts in Idaho had policies that allowed \nindividuals to use facilities and accommodations consistent with their gender identity. Dkt. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 3 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 4 of 37\n39-1, at 2. The other 75% of school districts did not have regulations one way or the other.1   \n On  July  6,  2023,  Plaintiffs  filed  this  lawsuit  challenging  S.B.  1100  as \nunconstitutional. \nPlaintiff Rebecca Roe is a twelve-year-old transgender girl2 who has attended school \nwithin the Boise School District since kindergarten. She began her social transition in the \nfifth grade and desires to use the restroom, and changing facilities, that coincides with her \ngender identity. Roe alleges that excluding her from those facilities will jeopardize her \nsocial transition, imperil her mental and physical health, and violate her right to privacy by \n“outing” her to her peers. Dkt. 15-1, at 13.  \nPlaintiff Sexuality and Gender Alliance (“SAGA”) is a student organization focused \non supporting, uplifting, and representing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer \n(LGBTQ) students at Boise High School. One of SAGA’s members, A.J. is a transgender \n \n1 This data comes from the Declaration of Greg Wilson, Chief of Staff for Defendant Debbie Critchfield, \nSuperintendent of the Idaho State Department of Education, and was filed as part of Defendants’ opposition \nto Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. Dkt. 39-1, at 2. Therein, Wilson states: “To the best \nof the State Education Department’s estimation, even before the enactment of SB 1100, the vast majority \nof Idaho public school districts (approximately three-quarters of school districts) maintained sex-separated \nrestrooms, changing facilities, and overnight accommodations and did not have any policy that would \npermit the relief that Plaintiffs seek here.” Id. Consistent with these representations, the Court previously \nstated that prior to S.B. 1100, 75% of school districts in Idaho had sex-separate regulations. Dkt. 44, at 4. \nThe parties clarified at the hearing, however, that while 25% of school districts had inclusive policies before \nS.B. 1100, 75% of school districts simply had no policy either way. Neither side was aware of any school \nthat affirmatively had a sex-separate policy. Wilson’s declaration is, therefore, somewhat misleading, if not \nwholly false. While it is true that 75% of school districts did not have a “policy that would permit the relief \nPlaintiffs seek” (i.e. they did not have a sex-inclusive policy), this is not the same thing as affirmatively \n“maintain[ing] sex-separated [facilities].” Although this information is not overly relevant to the Court’s \ndecision today, Defendants are reminded to be completely accurate in all representations before the Court \nto ensure just and fair results.     \n \n2 Roe was born a biological male but identifies as female.  \n \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 4 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 5 of 37\nboy.3 Like Roe, he wishes to use the restroom associated with his gender identity and \nasserts casting him out of those facilities will cause irreparable injuries.  \nDefendant Debbie Critchfield is Superintendent of Public Instruction in Idaho. The \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction is responsible for carrying out policies, procedures, \nand duties authorized by law regarding educational matters. Idaho Code § 33-125. The \nother Defendants are the State Board of Education and the members of that Board, as well \nas the Boise School District, its superintendent, and board members. All are responsible \nfor implementing, and governing, laws related to public education in Idaho.  \nIn  conjunction  with  their  Complaint,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  to  Proceed \nAnonymously (Dkt. 13)4 and the instant PI Motion. Dkt. 15. Defendants swiftly filed a \nMotion for Extension of Time (Dkt. 21) requesting an approximately 60-day extension to \nrespond to Plaintiffs’ PI Motion. The Court partially granted Defendants’ request, extended \nthe briefing deadlines, and set the PI Motion for a hearing on September 13, 2023. Dkt. 31. \nAs part of their opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Extension, Plaintiffs argued \nthe Court could grant the extension, but if it did so, it should also take other actions to \nprotect  Plaintiffs’  rights  in  the  interim—such  as  sua  sponte  issuing  a  Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”). Dkt. 25, at 3–4. In its July 20, 2023 Decision on Defendants’ \nMotion for Extension, the Court noted that while it could take other action, it would not do \nso on its own. Dkt. 31, at 4 (explaining it would not take any further action “sua sponte”).  \n \n3 A.J. was born a biological female but identifies as male.  \n \n4 Defendants did not respond to this motion, and the Court subsequently granted the request. Dkt. 38. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 5 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 6 of 37\nOn July 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO \nMotion”) asking the Court to do what they previously suggested the Court could do sua \nsponte: issue a TRO until the Court’s scheduled hearing and decision on the PI Motion. \nDkt. 34. Defendants opposed the Motion. Dkt. 39.  \nOn August 10, 2023, the Court issued a decision granting Plaintiffs’ TRO Motion. \nDkt. 44. In that decision, the Court explained that, because there is already a circuit split \nregarding the constitutionality of bills such as S.B. 1100, the factors it was required to \nweigh in reaching its decision were “roughly even” between the parties. Accordingly, the \nCourt chose to focus almost entirely on the concept of preserving the status quo. See \ngenerally id at 3–7. Said another way, the Court sought to maintain the landscape as it \nexisted prior to S.B. 1100 pending a more complete review of the issues. The Court \ndetermined the situation in Idaho before S.B. 1100 was inconsistent. Some schools and \nschool districts had “inclusive” policies while others had no policy whatsoever. Thus, the \nCourt “put[] a pause on S.B. 1100” and returned things to the way they were before: without \ncodified regulations either way. Id. at 8. The Court specifically noted it was not finding \nS.B. 1100 constitutional or unconstitutional. Id. at 8–9. Instead, it simply held S.B. 1100 \nin abeyance. Id. The Court’s decision today dives deeper into the substantive issues.  \nDefendants then filed their response brief to Plaintiffs’ PI Motion. Dkt. 48. In \naddition to opposing the motion, Defendants asked the Court to affirmatively dismiss all \nof Plaintiffs’ claims.  Id. Because this filing was a combined response (to the PI Motion) \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 6 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 7 of 37\nand new motion (to dismiss), the Court adjusted some of the briefing. See Dkt. 49.5  \nBriefing concluded and the Court held a hearing on September 13, 2023. Dkt. 53.  \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD  \nInjunctive relief “is an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22, (2008) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)). A party \nseeking a preliminary injunction must establish: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2) likely irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction; (3) that the balance \nof equities weighs in favor of an injunction; and (4) that an injunction is in the public \ninterest. Id. at 20. Where, as here, “the government is a party, these last two factors merge.” \nDrakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nV. ANALYSIS \n  The Court begins by reviewing the text of S.B. 1100. \n  S.B. 1100 requires that “every public school restroom or changing facility accessible \nby multiple persons at the same time must be: (a) Designated for use by male persons only \nor female persons only; and (b) Used only by members of that sex.” Idaho Code Ann. § \n33-6603(1)(a)–(b). The Bill also requires that “no person shall enter a multi-occupancy \nrestroom or changing facility that is designated for one sex unless such person is a member \nof that sex.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6603(2).  \nS.B.  1100  defines  “sex”  as  “the  immutable  biological  and  physiological \n \n5 The Court notes the United States exercised its right under 28 U.S.C. § 517 and submitted a Statement of \nInterest during this timeframe. Dkt. 41. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 7 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 8 of 37\ncharacteristics,  specifically  the  chromosomes  and  internal  and  external  reproductive \nanatomy, genetically determined at conception and generally recognizable at birth, that \ndefine an individual as male or female.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6602(3). \nIn addition to restrooms and changing facilities, S.B. 1100 requires that “during any \nschool  authorized  activity  or  event  where  persons  share  overnight  lodging,  school \npersonnel must provide separate sleeping quarters for members of each sex. No person \nshall share sleeping quarters, a restroom, or a changing facility with a person of the opposite \nsex, unless the persons are members of the same family.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6603(4).  \nS.B. 1100 carves out certain exemptions to these requirements, such as for cleaning \nstaff, medical personnel, coaching staff during athletic events, and in times of natural \ndisasters and emergencies. See generally Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6604(1)–(8).  \nThe Bill also requires that schools provide, upon written request, a “reasonable \naccommodation” to any student who, “for any reason, is unwilling or unable to use a multi-\noccupancy restroom or changing facility designated for the person’s sex and located within \na public school building, or multi-occupancy sleeping quarters while attending a public \nschool-sponsored activity.” Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6605(1)(a). \nFinally, S.B. 1100 provides a civil cause of action against the school for any student \nwho encounters a person of the opposite sex in a restroom, changing facility, or sleeping \nquarters and it is determined the school gave that person permission to use the facilities of \nthe opposite sex or failed to prohibit the person from using facilities of the opposite sex. \nIdaho Code Ann. § 33-6606(1)(a)–(b). The student, if successful, can recover $5,000, \nattorney’s fees, and other monetary damages.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 8 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 9 of 37\nPlaintiffs allege S.B. 1100 is unconstitutional and violates: (1) the Equal Protection \nClause, (2) Title IX, and (3) their right to privacy. Dkt. 1, at 30–37. Against the backdrop \nof the Winter factors, the Court addresses these claims in turn.  \nA. Success on the Merits \nThe Court previously observed—in deciding the TRO Motion—that it could not \nmake a well-reasoned decision on this critical first factor because it had only received \nPlaintiffs’ briefing at that juncture. Dkt. 44, at 7–8. Noting the current circuit split on \nrelevant matters, the Court stated it would give this issue a more “complete review” later. \nId. Today is that time, and with the benefit of full briefing and oral argument, the Court \ndelves into these substantive issues. \n1.  Equal Protection  \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state \nshall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV, § 1. It is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated \nshould be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 \n(1985). The state may not discriminate against classes of people in an “arbitrary or \nirrational” way or with the “bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.” Id. at \n446–47. As the Court noted at the outset, however, this aspirational promise must coexist \nwith the practical reality that laws often draw lines between groups of people, and those \nlines may naturally prove advantageous to some groups while disadvantaging others. \nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996).  \nWhen considering an equal protection claim, the Court must first determine what \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 9 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 10 of 37\nlevel of scrutiny to apply and then decide whether the policy at issue survives that level of \nscrutiny.  \nThere are three levels of review: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational \nbasis review. Laws are subject to strict scrutiny when they discriminate against a suspect \nclass, such as a racial group, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326 (2003), or when \nthey discriminate based on any classification but impact a fundamental right, such as the \nright to vote. E.g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964). Laws are subject to \nintermediate scrutiny when they discriminate based on certain other suspect classifications, \nsuch as gender. Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 723 (1982). When no \nsuspect class is involved and no fundamental right is burdened, courts apply a rational basis \ntest to determine the legitimacy of the classification. Olagues v. Russoniello, 770 F.2d 791, \n802 (9th Cir.1985). \nIn this case, the parties agree the Court must apply intermediate, or heightened, \nscrutiny.6 But they disagree on why the Court uses this level of review. Because the parties \nagree, the Court is reluctant to say more, but feels compelled to clearly state why it is \napplying  intermediate  scrutiny  in  this  case  because  the  distinction  bears  on  various \nconclusions throughout this decision.  \nPlaintiffs assert that, consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent, intermediate scrutiny \napplies  because  transgender persons  represent  a  quasi-suspect  class.  See  Karnoski  v. \n \n6 See, e.g., Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 463–465 (1988) (referring to intermediate scrutiny as “heightened \nscrutiny” in the equal protection context, which similarly distinguishes between three levels of scrutiny—\nstrict, heightened, and rational basis). \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 10 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 11 of 37\nTrump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200-01 (9th Cir. 2019). The Court does not disagree with this \nassertion but notes the circuit in Karnoski did not explicitly hold transgender individuals \nconstitute a quasi-suspect class; only that intermediate scrutiny applies if a law or policy \ntreats transgender persons in a less favorable way than all others. Notably, Courts within \nthe District of Idaho, including this court, have held that transgender individuals qualify as \na quasi-suspect class. See F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1143–1145 (2018); Hecox \nv. Little, 479 F. Supp. 3d 930, 973 (D. Idaho 2020) (“Hecox”). \nDefendants, on the other hand, argue S.B. 1100 does not classify students based \nupon their sexual orientation or gender identity, but on their biological sex—male and \nfemale—and that, consistent with Supreme Court precedent, classifications based on sex \nare subject to intermediate scrutiny. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988). The \nCourt agrees with Defendants.7 The classification that is drawn by S.B. 1100 is based upon \nsex, not gender identity. \nThe Court will discuss this concept in greater detail later, but notes here that the \ndefinition of sex (in S.B. 1100 and in the legal community as a whole) does not include \ngender identity as Plaintiffs seem to suggest. The Supreme Court has never defined sex to \ninclude gender identity.8 Even in Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga—a recent landmark decision \n \n7 The Court recognizes the Ninth Circuit’s recent holding that gender identity is “at least a quasi-suspect \nclass.” Hecox v. Little, 79 F.4th 1009, 1026 (9th Cir. Aug. 17, 2023) (citing Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d \n1180, 1200–01 (9th Cir. 2019)). Again, the Court does not disagree. But that is not the issue. The issue is \nwhether gender identity is the distinction drawn by S.B. 1100. The Court finds it is not.  \n \n8 In fact, the Court cannot locate a single case where a court at any level defined the term “sex” to include \n“gender identity” or “transgender status.” To be sure, this is, no doubt, partially because until recently the \nterm “gender” and “sex” were synonymous. And, as noted, courts have found that discrimination based on \ntransgender status or gender identity can be equated to sex discrimination. This line of reasoning is likely \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 11 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 12 of 37\nabout discrimination against transgender individuals in employment—the United States \nSupreme Court did not disturb the parties’ agreed-upon definition that sex referred to the \n“biological  distinctions  between  male  and  female”  and  that  “homosexuality  and \ntransgender status are distinct concepts from sex.” 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1739, 1746–47 (2020). \nNow, the Bostock Court ultimately held that “discrimination based on homosexuality or \ntransgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex” in the context of Title \nVII, but the Court did not change the underlying definition of “sex.” Id.  \nTurning closer to home, this Court, in Hecox—another case that will be discussed \nin  more  detail  below—held  that  the  definition  of  “sex”  was  “the  anatomical  and \nphysiological processes that lead to or denote male or female. Typically, sex is determined \nat birth based on the appearance of external genitalia.” 479 F. Supp. 3d at 945. On appeal, \nthe Ninth Circuit did not formally define sex. While it called out the challenged Act’s \ndefinition of sex as “an oversimplification of the complicated biological reality of sex and \ngender” it did not define the term itself, nor did it disturb this Court’s definition. Hecox v. \nLittle, 79 F.4th 1009, 1024 (9th Cir. Aug. 17, 2023).9 To be sure, the Ninth Circuit found \nthat the definition of sex in the law Hecox challenged functioned as a “form of [p]roxy \ndiscrimination,” but, like Bostock, it did not redefine the term “sex” itself. Id. at 1024.  \n \nwhy Plaintiffs contend that the definition of sex is not dispositive of their claims in this case and that, \nregardless of how sex is defined, S.B. 1100 discriminates against transgender individuals. As will be \nexplained, however, simply because a certain group is left out of the classification drawn by a particular \nlaw does not mean that law is “targeted” at that group. Terms must be given definitions. And those \ndefinitions must mean something. Here, S.B. 1100 defines “sex” based on biology. No court presented with \nthis same issue has defined the term otherwise.    \n \n9 Defendants in Hecox recently asked for a hearing before the full Ninth Circuit (en banc). Ninth Cir. Case \nNo. 20-35815, Dkt. 219. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 12 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 13 of 37\nThe Court will return to these cases, and concepts, throughout this decision. But \nbecause the definition of sex—in S.B. 1100 and in cases before this district, the circuit, and \nthe Supreme Court—does not include gender identity, S.B. 1100 does not draw a line based \nupon gender identity, but on sex.10 And because any regulation based upon sex warrants \nintermediate scrutiny, that is the level of scrutiny the Court will use here today.11   \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, “a party seeking to uphold government action based \non sex must establish an exceedingly persuasive justification for the classification.” United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 524 (1996) (cleaned up).  \nHere, Plaintiffs contend S.B. 1100 does not withstand intermediate scrutiny, and \nthat they have a likelihood of success on their equal protection claim, because Defendants \ncannot show the Bill is tailored to the Defendants’ stated interests of privacy and safety.  \nNaturally, Defendants disagree, asserting that separating bathrooms for privacy is \n“common sense” and dates to time immemorial. Defendants’ comments, and overall \narguments, echo the sentiments articulated in the Eleventh Circuit’s en banc opinion in \nAdams ex rel. Kasper v. School Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) \n(“Adams”). Because Defendants rely heavily on this case, and because the Court finds that \nCourt’s analysis persuasive, it will briefly review Adams.  \n \n10 Definitions aside, even if the Court found S.B. 1100 discriminated based on transgender status, it would \nstill apply intermediate scrutiny. Thus, the Court does not depart from its prior finding that transgender \nindividuals qualify as a quasi-suspect class; it simply finds that is not the distinction at issue in S.B. 1100.  \n \n11 And while S.B. 1100 is based on sex, it does not include any of the hallmarks of sex discrimination. It \ndoes not prefer one sex over the other; include one sex and exclude the other; provide benefits to one sex \nand not the other; or apply one rule to one sex and not the other. It distinguishes between the two sexes, but \nit does not advantage, or disadvantage, either. Bostock’s holding about the interplay between discrimination \nbased up on transgender status and sex does not change that fact.   \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 13 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 14 of 37\nIn Adams, the Eleventh Circuit upheld a lower court order rejecting an equal \nprotection challenge to a K-12 school policy that provided female, male, and sex-neutral \nbathrooms, and required male students to use the male-designated bathrooms, female \nstudents to use the female-designated bathrooms, and accommodated transgender students \nwith sex-neutral bathrooms. See id. at 797. The policy at issue in that case defined “male” \nand “female” as the gender identified on a student’s birth certificate. See id. The Eleventh \nCircuit rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the policy unconstitutionally discriminated based \non transgender status and found that it was “substantially related” to the school district’s \nimportant interest in securing its pupils’ privacy and welfare. See id. at 811. That court \nspecifically held the challenged policy was not targeted at transgender students—at most, \nit had a disparate impact upon them which did not rise to the level of a constitutional \nviolation because no animus was shown. Id.12  \nThe Court also briefly previews the other circuit cases dealing with these issues that \nconstitute the “circuit split” it has referred to.  \nIn 2020, the Fourth Circuit upheld a challenge, brought by a transgender male \nstudent, against a school district policy that required students to use bathrooms based on \n \n12 There are, of course, differences between Adams and the present case. For one, the district court in Adams \nreached its conclusion after a three-day bench trial. That decision was obviously overturned, but the \nprocedure there was slightly different than that before the Court today. Relatedly, the bench trial in Adams \nhighlighted the fact that the school district had studied these issues extensively and involved members of \nthe LGBTQ community in enacting its policies. The Court is not saying this factor was dispositive of any \nmerits-based issue (at the district or appellate level), but there is no evidence in the present record to suggest \nthe Idaho legislature involved members of the LGBTQ community in crafting S.B. 1100. Such an effort \nmay have yielded fruit. Finally, it goes without saying, but the dispute in Adams revolved around a school \ndistrict policy, while the challenge today is to a state-wide law. Regardless of the procedural differences \nbetween Adams and this case, the Court finds the Adams decision persuasive for the reasons outlined herein. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 14 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 15 of 37\ntheir biological sex. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020), as \namended (Aug. 28, 2020). There, the Circuit found that the school’s refusal to amend the \nstudent’s records to reflect his gender identity violated the Equal Protection Clause and \nconstituted discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX. See generally id.  \nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit similarly affirmed a district court’s decision to enter a \npreliminary injunction against a school district’s unwritten policy that barred a transgender \nmale student from using the boys’ bathroom after he started his female-to-male transition. \nWhitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034 \n(7th Cir. 2017). There, the Circuit determined the school board’s decision violated Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause. See generally id.  \nMore  recently,  the  Seventh  Circuit  noted  the  existing  circuit  split,  reaffirmed \nWhitaker, and declined to give credence to Adams in upholding two preliminary injunctions \nentered by district courts enjoining school districts from restricting transgender students \nfrom using restrooms and locker rooms of their choice.

In their motion, Defendants bring a recent decision from the Sixth \nCircuit, L.W. v. Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688 (6th Cir. Sept. 28, 2023), to the Court’s attention. In Skrmetti, \nthe Sixth Circuit reversed injunctions against state laws that restricted certain medical treatments for minors \nwith gender dysphoria. Although the subject matter of that case is different, the Circuit there grappled with \nsome of the same issues before the Court today. The Court is aware of the Skrmetti decision and, like all \ncases, will give it the weight it deems appropriate. Defendants could have brought this decision to the Court \nvia a Notice of Supplemental Authority, but insofar as they did so via Motion, the Court will grant the same.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 15 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 16 of 37\nNinth Circuit has, on numerous occasions, reiterated its “longstanding recognition that the \ndesire to shield one’s unclothed figure from the view of strangers, and particularly strangers \nof the opposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.” Byrd v. \nMaricopa  Cnty.  Sheriff’s  Dep’t,  629  F.3d  1135,  1141  (9th  Cir.  2011)  (cleaned  up) \n(collecting cases). Other circuits agree. See, e.g., Adams, 57 F.4th at 806 (“[I]t is well \nestablished that individuals enjoy protection of their privacy interests in the bathroom, so \nconcerns about privacy in the bathroom are legitimate concerns.”); Faulkner v. Jones, 10 \nF.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting “society’s undisputed approval of separate public \nrest rooms for men and women based on privacy concerns”); Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d \n1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (recognizing a “constitutional right to bodily privacy because \nmost people have a special sense of privacy in their genitals, and involuntary exposure of \nthem  in  the  presence  of  people  of  the  other  sex  may  be  especially  demeaning  and \nhumiliating” (cleaned up)).  \nBut it does not take a court to acknowledge what most people inherently recognize: \na desire for bodily privacy in restrooms (and like spaces) is rational because one’s body is \nprivate. That individuals generally desire privacy is based upon the inherent differences \nbetween male and female bodies. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) \n(“Physical differences between men and women [] are enduring: The two sexes are not \nfungible; a community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community \ncomposed of both.” (cleaned up)). This appreciation is even more relevant considering \nschool-age children are still developing—mentally, physically, emotionally, and socially—\nand asking them to expose their bodies to students of the opposite sex (or to be exposed to \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 16 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 17 of 37\nthe bodies of the opposite sex) brings heightened levels of stress.   \n  There is no doubt S.B. 1100 is substantially related to the Government’s legitimate \ninterest in said privacy. Restrooms, changing facilities, and overnight accommodations are, \nwithout question, spaces in school (and out of school as the case may be) where bodily \nexposure is most likely to occur. That S.B. 1100 restricts access to who will interact in \nthose circumstances based upon sex furthers the goal of privacy.    \nThe Court next turns to Plaintiffs’ counterarguments and why each is unavailing in \ncalling into question Defendant’s legitimate interest in privacy.  \nPlaintiffs first argue that the Ninth Circuit has already definitely answered whether \nprivacy can justify sex-separation in bathrooms. In Parents for Privacy v. Barr, the Ninth \nCircuit rejected a challenge to a policy that allowed transgender students to use restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and showers that matched their gender identity, rather than their biological \nsex assigned at birth. 949 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2020). There, the Circuit found the school \ndistrict’s  policy  did  not  infringe  on  the  privacy  rights  of  petitioners  because \naccommodations were available for any student who did not want to share facilities with a \ntransgender student. Plaintiffs in this case assert the outcome in Parents for Privacy means \nthe Ninth Circuit would reject Defendants’ privacy justification today. The Court is not so \nsure.  \nTo begin, while somewhat perplexing to say aloud, it appears gender-inclusive \npolicies are constitutional and sex-separate policies are constitutional. That is to say, \nParents for Privacy’s holding that the Constitution does not require sex-separate facilities \nis not the same as a holding that the Constitution forbids sex-separate facilities. More \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 17 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 18 of 37\nimportantly, the Ninth Circuit recently noted that “bathrooms by their very nature implicate \nimportant privacy interest” because, unquestionably “the functions of the bathroom are \nintended to be private.” Hecox, 79 F.4th at 1025 n.10. Thus, whether privacy is a legitimate \ninterest for sex-based distinctions is still an open question. The Ninth Circuit has not, \nhowever, foreclosed Defendants’ arguments as Plaintiffs suggest.    \n  Plaintiffs next contend Defendants’ privacy justification ignores the fact that most \ntransgender students use individual stalls in bathrooms so there is no reason a cisgender \nstudents’ “privacy” will even be impacted. Dkt. 15-1 (citing Grimm, 972 F.3d at 613). The \nCourt understands Plaintiffs’ argument. Not to be unduly technical, but transgender girls \nwould  use  individual  stalls  because  female  restrooms  do  not  contain  urinals.  And \ntransgender boys cannot physically use urinals and would, therefore, also use individual \nstalls. Thus, an argument could be made that often people in the restroom would never \nknow the gender identity of the person going into the stall next to them. But this argument \ndiscounts the other provisions of S.B. 1100 dealing with changing facilities and overnight \naccommodations. While privacy may not be as much of a concern in restrooms where stalls \nare widely used, the same cannot be clearly said of shared changing facilities and overnight \naccommodations. \n Third, Plaintiffs assert S.B. 1100 is a solution in search of a problem. They aver \nthere is no evidence of transgender students engaging in behaviors that infringe upon the \nprivacy of others. Defendants do not dispute this. Neither does the Court. But this argument \nmisses the mark. The issue is not whether any transgender student has affirmatively done \nanything—good, bad, or otherwise—to another student. The issue is whether a student \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 18 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 19 of 37\nmust, against his or her wishes, be forced to change (or undertake other private duties) in \nthe presence of someone of the opposite sex14—even if the person of the opposite sex is \ndoing nothing invasive, dangerous, or threatening. The Court will circle back to this \nmomentarily when discussing Hecox, but S.B. 1100 essentially boils down to this issue. \nThe Bill is not based upon animus towards those who identify as transgender, nor was it \npassed to relegate transgender students to the fringes of society. S.B. 1100 was enacted to \nprotect the privacy of the sexes. A policy or statute can lawfully classify based on biological \nsex without unlawfully discriminating based on transgender status. \nRelatedly,  Plaintiffs’  assert  it  is  transgender  students  who  will  suffer  the  real \ninvasion of privacy if S.B. 1100 is allowed to go into effect. As explained in the Court’s \ndiscussion on their privacy claim, Plaintiffs here are referring more to informational \nprivacy in their gender identity and biological sex as opposed to privacy in the sense the \nCourt has been using the word thus far, i.e. being free from interference and intrusion when \nengaged in private physical activities like changing or using the restroom. And while \nPlaintiffs do not explicitly make the argument, the Court recognizes transgender students \nmay feel an invasion of their privacy (in the context of taking care of their physical needs) \nin having to comply with S.B. 1100 and use restrooms or facilities that do not match their \ngender identity.15 The Court understands the concerns and recognizes the reality that in \n \n14 This issue is complicated by the fact that individuals transition differently. Some choose to alter certain \nphysical characteristics; others do not. Not to mention the fact that individuals could conceivably change \ntheir gender identity from one school year to the next (or even during the year). Without a clear \ndemarcation—some objective “line in the sand” so to speak—there would be no regulations at all and thus \nno expectation of privacy for anyone at any time in any circumstance.   \n15 As with the Court’s example about restroom stall usage, it does not mean to point out the obvious or \nminimize any student’s experience by relegating it to an example. Traversing school for young people is \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 19 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 20 of 37\nprotecting the privacy of some students, the privacy of others decreases. The reality, \nhowever, is that neither the Court, nor the law, can fairly accommodate all interests. See \nCaribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 678 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting that, \nwhen dealing with privacy  concerns, it is often difficult to accommodate competing \ninterests). \nSpeaking of accommodations, Plaintiffs complain the carve-out in S.B. 1100 is not \na sufficient accommodation. Their only argument, however, is that allowing transgender \nstudents to use “other” facilities is stigmatizing and damaging. Dkt. 15-1, at 12. The Court \nwill touch on this more when discussing harm below but returns to the Ninth Circuit’s \nholding in Parents for Privacy. As a reminder, that case was the inverse of this case: \nPlaintiffs challenged an inclusive policy the school district had enacted. Part of the reason \nthe Circuit found the challenged policy did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment was \nbecause there were accommodations offered to those who did not want to share facilities \nwith transgendered students. 949 F.3d at 1225. And it made this finding “even though those \nalternative options admittedly appear inferior and less convenient.” Id. So too in this case. \nS.B. 1100 provides options for transgender students—actually for any students—who do \nnot wish to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex. The convenience \n \ndifficult enough without having to worry about “legal” questions surrounding daily bodily functions such \nas using the restroom and changing. The Court recognizes that in upholding S.B. 1100, it is now those \ntransgender students who will be using the restroom (or changing facility) that does not match his or her \ngender  identity  who  may  face  privacy  concerns.  S.B.  1100  could  make  that  transgender  student \nuncomfortable. It could make others in those facilities uncomfortable as well. While a transgender girl may \nmake a cisgender girl uncomfortable, she may also make a cisgender boy uncomfortable. And both \ncisgender girls and cisgender boys could make a transgender boy uncomfortable. Thus, any regulation (or \neven no regulation at all) could, conceivably, cause some students to feel uncomfortable. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 20 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 21 of 37\nand desirability of those options, however, is not an overly relevant part of the equation. \nBut  if  “compelling”  cisgender  students  to  use  alternate  facilities  is  a  reasonable \naccommodation, there is no reason to suggest asking transgender students to do the same \nwould bring a different result.   \nLastly, the Court returns to Hecox. Plaintiffs assert the Court’s original decision in \nHecox (and the Circuit’s affirmance of that decision) is instructive and urge the Court to \nfollow the rulings in that case because the legal issues in this case are the same. Not quite.   \nIn Hecox, the Plaintiffs brought a constitutional challenge to Idaho’s Fairness in \nWomen’s Sports Act (the “Act”) which prohibited transgender athletes from participating \nin women’s sports. The Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction and \nenjoined  the  law  from  going  into  effect.  Among  other  things,  the  Court  found  the \nDefendants’ justifications for the Act’s categorical exclusion of transgender women from \nwomen’s sports—promoting sex equality for cisgender women in sports and protecting \nscholarships for women—were not legitimate government interests because there were \nother ways to achieve those goals. Defendants appealed and the Circuit affirmed. Plaintiffs \nin this case cite heavily from both decisions, particularly in support of the notion that S.B. \n1100 discriminates based upon transgender status.  \nThe Court begins by reiterating that Defendants in Hecox have asked for en banc \nreview. Resolution of that case is thus, still an open matter. More importantly, there is a \nsmall, but important difference between the Act and S.B. 1100 that renders Plaintiffs’ \ndiscrimination argument less persuasive in the present dispute.  \nIn Hecox, the Defendants argued, much as they do here, that the Act did not \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 21 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 22 of 37\ndiscriminate on the basis of transgender status because it classified individuals based upon \nbiological sex. 79 F.4th at 1025. The Circuit explained, however, that this argument \nappeared pretextual because it was only transgender female athletes who were excluded \nunder the law; the Act allowed transgender male athletes the opportunity to compete on \nmale sports teams. What’s more, the act subjected only female (cisgender or transgender) \nathletes to a verification process but did not mandate the same for male (cisgender or \ntransgender) athletes. Noting that “a law is not immune to an equal protection challenge if \nit discriminates only against some members of a protected class but not others,” the Circuit \nrejected Defendants’ argument. Id. Because the Act excluded only transgender females and \nmandated certain requirements just for females (cisgender and transgender) the Ninth \nCircuit agreed Plaintiffs could likely show it discriminated on the basis of transgender \nstatus and on the basis of sex. Simply put, Defendants could not fairly say the act \ndifferentiated based on sex when one biological sex was treated better than the other and \nthe law had requirements that only affected one quasi-suspect class of people.16  \nS.B. 1100 is different. It does not prohibit only transgender girls from using facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity; it “prohibits” both transgender girls and transgender \n \n16 The Ninth Circuit significantly hedged its decision in Hecox. It specifically noted it was not deciding the \n“larger question of whether any restriction on transgender participation in sports violates equal protection.” \n79 F.4th at 1039. See also id. at 1052 (“In my understanding, nothing in today’s decision, or in the district \ncourt’s decision, precludes policymakers from adopting appropriate regulations in this field—regulations \nthat are substantially related to important governmental interests.”) (Christen J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part). The Circuit explained its ruling was “narrow” and only answered the question of whether \nthe district court abused its discretion. Id. at 1016, 1020, 1021, 1039, 1050. It also observed that, in the time \nsince the district court issued its opinion, some of the world’s leading athletic organizations—including \nsome the district court relied on in reaching its original decision—had revisited their guidance concerning \ntransgender athletes. Id. at 1051. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 22 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 23 of 37\nboys from using those facilities. And both sides of the classification at issue—biological \nmales and biological females—includes transgender students. Thus, to say S.B. 1100 \nsingles out transgender students mischaracterizes how the law operates. The Court is not \nimplying that because the law “discriminates” equally it is lawful, but rather because S.B. \n1100 does not differentiate between transgender boys and transgender girls—even though \nit does differentiate amongst the biological sexes—the conclusion from Hecox does not \napply here. To repeat, S.B. 1100 is not based upon sexual orientation or gender identity; it \nis based on sex. And that basis is equal between the sexes and between transgender students \nwho belong to both sexes. That other groupings of individuals are left out is, therefore, not \ndiscrimination against those groups, but rather a natural consequence of setting parameters. \nRomer, 517 U.S. at 631.17  \nA final word on discrimination. The term “discrimination” has become quite the \nbuzzword over the past twenty years. And it is typically used in a very derogatory manner. \nTo be sure, one definition of discrimination is a “prejudiced or prejudicial outlook, action, \nor  treatment.”  Merriam-Webster  Dictionary,  https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/discrimination (last visited October 12, 2023). Another definition, \nhowever, is “the act of making or perceiving a difference.” Id. The Court does not mean to \nget into semantics, but the prevalent idea in society today that simply because a person \nsupports one position necessarily means he or she “discriminates” against the other position \n \n17 Additionally, as outlined above, unlike the Court’s findings in Hecox, it has determined the disparate \ntreatment S.B. 1100 mandates in this case is substantially related to the government’s stated interest of \nprivacy and safety.   \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 23 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 24 of 37\n(or against a person who supports the opposite position) is short-sighted.18 Reasonable \npeople can support one position and not have any animus or ill-intent for the other position. \nThe Court is not implying that some supporters of S.B. 1100 are basing their support on \ncompletely altruistic feelings. But it is not implying they are basing their support on animus \nor hatred either. The Court receives enough “hate mail” and “hate calls” to know there are \npeople on both sides of the equation who do not have respect for the other side. But \nPlaintiffs’ repeated arguments that the proponents of S.B. 1100 all demonstrated blatant \ndiscriminatory animus against transgender students during the legislative history falls flat \nwhen those statements are read in context. See Dkt. 15-1.   \nLastly, the Court wishes to address the concept of “safety.” Besides asserting \nDefendants cannot meet their burden that S.B. 1100 is related to privacy, Plaintiffs also \ncontend Defendants cannot show S.B. 1100 is substantially related to any legitimate \nconcerns surrounding “safety.” The difficult part of this argument is that Defendants \ncombine the two concepts. They couch their support of S. B. 1100 in terms of “safety and \nprivacy.” And, to a large degree, Plaintiffs do as well. Thus, the Court finds it need not \nmake a separate determination as to “safety.” For the most part, the Court agrees that, in \nthis context, the concepts are substantially related. Furthermore, because the Court has \nalready determined Defendants have shown the nexus between S.B. 1100 and privacy, even \nwere the Court to construe the term “safety” separately, it would still not carry the day for \n \n18 Those who attempt to force some type of ideological purity on others, or who reject as bigoted and \ndiscriminatory any opinion that differs with their own, would be wise to remember that the refusal to listen \nto the other side of a debate swiftly leads to less collaboration, less protection, and ultimately less freedom. \nIn a pluralistic society, the exploration—not acceptance, but also not facial rejection—of a variety of ideas \nis what makes this Country great.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 24 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 25 of 37\nPlaintiffs in achieving a preliminary injunction. As the Supreme Court has observed, “in a \npublic school environment[,] . . . the State is responsible for maintaining discipline, health, \nand safety.” Bd. of Educ. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 830 (2002) (emphasis added).   \nIn sum, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not met their burden in showing they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their Equal Protection claim. S.B. 1100 distinguishes \nbased upon sex, not gender identity.19 Moreover, S.B. 1100 is substantially related to the \nGovernment’s important interest in protecting the privacy and safety of students from those \nof the opposite sex while they are engaged in personal and private functions.  \n2.  Title IX  \nPlaintiffs contend they are likely to succeed on their Title IX claim for the “same \nreasons” they are likely to succeed on their equal protection claim. Dkt. 15-1, at 22. Insofar \nas the Court has found Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their equal protection claim, \nit will not repeat that analysis here. Still, the Court must discuss Title IX separately to \nhighlight relevant nuances.    \nTitle IX provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a). \n  The threshold problem is, again, whether S.B. 1100 is based on sex. Plaintiffs \n \n19 But as already noted, even if the Court found the classification drawn by S.B. 1100 was based on \ntransgender status, it would still find Plaintiffs have not met their burden because privacy is a legitimate \ngovernment interest regardless of which suspect class is at issue.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 25 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 26 of 37\ncontend S.B. 1100 discriminates based upon transgender status and that, consistent with \nthe Supreme Court’s holding in Bostock that discrimination against transgender people \nconstitutes discrimination based on sex, the Court should apply that same reasoning here \nand strike the Bill down. 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). There are two problems with Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on Bostock. First, that case dealt with Title VII; this case deals with Title IX. \nSecond, as outlined, S.B. 1100 is a law based upon sex, not sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  \nThere is no doubt the Supreme Court held in Bostock that discrimination “because \nof” sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. 140 S. Ct. at 1743. \nBut the Bostock Court also made it painstakingly clear that its holding did not “sweep \nbeyond Title VII to other federal or state laws” or “address bathrooms, locker rooms, or \nanything else of the kind.” Id. at 1753.20 Moreover, the fact that the Bostock court held that \nclassifications based on gender identity are necessarily classifications based on sex does \nnot mean that classifications based on sex (as here) are necessarily classifications based on \ngender identity.21  \nNotably, there is a circuit split on whether Bostock’s Title VII analysis applies in \nthe Title IX context. The Sixth Circuit has held that “it does not follow that principles \nannounced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context.” Meriwether \n \n20 In fact, Justice Alito, in his dissent, specifically pointed to Hecox (which at the time was just a newly \nfiled lawsuit), and his concerns about how the Supreme Court’s decision would be read in cases where Title \nIX was at issue. 140 S. Ct. at 1780, 1783 (Alito, J. dissenting).  \n \n21 And in Bostock, the employers fired adult employees because their behavior was perceived as inconsistent \nwith gender stereotypes. Here, the law is directed at children and does not depend on how a student acts or \nidentifies; it only depends on the student’s sex. Those factual distinctions are relevant as well.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 26 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 27 of 37\nv. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021). The Eleventh Circuit in Adams likewise \nheld that the interpretation of the word “sex” set forth in Bostock does not apply to Title \nIX. 57 F.4th at 811–14. And, while the Fifth Circuit has held “transgender discrimination \nis a form of sex discrimination under Title VII,” it has not held as much with respect to \nTitle IX. Olivarez v. T-mobile USA, Inc., 997 F.3d 595, 603 (5th Cir. 2021).  \nConversely, in Grimm, the Fourth Circuit held that “although Bostock interprets \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . it guides our evaluation of claims under Title \nIX.” (cleaned up). 972 F.3d at 616. In like manner, the Ninth Circuit recently held that \n“discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex-based discrimination \nunder Title IX.” Grabowski v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116 (9th Cir. 2023).22 \nPlaintiffs rely on Grabowski and assert they prevail on their Title IX claim outright. \nAgain, however, S.B. 1100 is based on sex, not sexual orientation23 or gender identity. \nMore importantly, Title IX already allows the practice of sex-separate facilities. Again, \nwhile odd to say, the legal landscape is such that discrimination based on sexual orientation \n(and maybe gender identity) appears barred under Title IX, but Title IX also allows for sex-\n \n22 For its part, the Court is of the opinion that Title VII and Title IX should be treated differently. The two \nTitles have differing language, implicate different legal liability structures, and serve different purposes. \nFor example, Title IX talks about discrimination “on the basis of sex” whereas Title VII talks in terms of \n“because of sex.” These phrases are different, and the Court must give full effect to the difference in word \nchoice. Henry J. Friendly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, in Benchmarks 224 (1967) \n(“[W]hen Congress employs the same word, it normally means the same thing, when it employs different \nwords, it usually means different things.”). By failing to acknowledge the different phrases Title VII and \nTitle IX employ, the Court “would risk amending [the] statutes outside the legislative process reserved for \nthe people’s representatives.” Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1738. Because Title IX prohibits “on the basis of sex,” \nthe Court is hesitant to reflexively adopt Bostock’s “because of sex” causation analysis.  \n \n23 Grabowski dealt with sexual orientation, not gender identity, in the context of Title IX. Whether that \ndifference is material is debatable, but the Court’s point is that case is not on “all fours” with this case as \nPlaintiffs suggest.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 27 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 28 of 37\nseparated facilities. Thus, unless and until Congress amends Title IX, the concept of \nseparating facilities based on sex is not a form of discrimination actionable under Title IX.    \nWhile  prohibiting  discrimination  based  upon  sex,  the  regulations  in  Title  IX \nspecifically outline that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any \neducational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. And the corresponding code sections \nimplementing Title IX outline that educational institutions “may provide separate toilet, \nlocker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” so long as the facilities “provided \nfor students of one sex [are] comparable to [the] facilities provided for students of the other \nsex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nThe United States, in its statement of interest, references these exceptions but asserts \nthey do not apply when a student is transgender. Dkt. 41, at 10.24 It reaches this conclusion \nbased upon the idea that “excluding a student from a particular single-sex restroom or \nlocker room facility designated for another sex, as a general rule, does not cause that \nstudent harm.” Id. But, because the students here are transgender, and excluding them could \ncause harm, the United States (and Plaintiffs) aver the Court can simply ignore these \nimplementing regulations. The Court cannot agree.  \n \n24 Defendants argue the United States is barred from making this argument because of an injunction in \nanother case where the state of Idaho is a plaintiff. Specifically, in Tennessee v. United States Dep’t of \nEduc., a federal district court enjoined the United States from arguing a specific letter explaining how Title \nIX applied to transgender individuals was formal Department of Education guidance because the letter had \nnot gone through the notice and comment process under the Administrative Procedures Act. 615 F. Supp. \n3d 807 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). While the Court agrees with Defendants that the United States cannot argue \nthere is official guidance on how Title IX should be interpreted in cases such as this, that is not what the \nUnited States does here. It simply states its position. Such is acceptable and does not run afoul of the \ninjunction in Tennessee.   \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 28 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 29 of 37\nAgain, S.B. 1100 is a regulation based upon sex. And while Title IX itself does not \ndefine sex,25 even the authorities Plaintiffs cite in support of their position do not go as far \nas they would like. Enter again Parents for Privacy. Plaintiffs once more cite to Parents \nfor  Privacy  and  argue  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  foreclosed  Defendants’  argument  today \nbecause inclusive facilities have been upheld and any type of contrary regulation is \ndiscriminatory. But to repeat: just because inclusive facilities are constitutional does not \nmean sex-separate facilities are unconstitutional. Because Parents for Privacy was the \ninverse of this case, it takes some mental gymnastics to determine how the Ninth Circuit’s \nholdings there may affect matters here. In rejecting those plaintiffs’ challenge that the \nschool’s inclusive policy violated Title IX, the Ninth Circuit in Parents for Privacy found \n“just because Title IX authorizes sex-segregated facilities does not mean that they are \nrequired, let alone that they must be segregated based only on biological sex and cannot \naccommodate gender identity.”  949 F.3d at 1227. Thus, while the Ninth Circuit ruled that \ninclusive policies were allowed, it also clearly stated that Title IX authorizes exactly what \nS.B. 1100 has done here: create sex-separate facilities. The bottom line is that Title IX may \nnot preclude regulations based on, or incorporating, gender identity, but it does not require \nthem either.  \n \n25 The Fourth and Seventh Circuits—in Grimm and A.C.—essentially determined that, in the context of \nTitle IX, the term “sex” should be read to include gender identity. Although neither court explicitly states \nthis, the outcome of both cases makes clear those courts viewed gender identity as included under the “sex’ \numbrella of Title IX. The Eleventh Circuit (in Adams) held that “sex” means biological sex in the context \nof Title IX based upon the legislative history and understanding of the term “sex” when Title IX was \nenacted. The Court will not undertake a separate review of the history of Title IX at this time but notes its \nagreement with the Adams majority (and Judge Niemeyer’s dissent in Grimm and Judge Easterbrook’s \ndissent in A.C.) that Title IX is not ambiguous and—consistent with its findings above regarding the general \nlegal definition of “sex,”—the definition of “sex” in Title IX does not include gender identity.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 29 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 30 of 37\nUltimately, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not shown they are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their Title IX claim because Title IX allows the structure S.B. 1100 mandates. \nFurthermore, while Title VII and Title IX are related in certain aspects—thus rendering \nBostock  and  other  cases  helpful—they  differ  materially  in  other  respects  and  those \ndifferences are crucial in this case. Ultimately the Court finds Plaintiffs have not met their \nburden of establishing a likelihood of success on their Title IX claim.  \n3.  Privacy \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue they are likely to succeed on their privacy claims because \nforcing them to use certain facilities could expose their gender identity and doing so would \nbe a violation of their privacy. As noted, the specific privacy interest Plaintiffs advocate \nhere is slightly different than the privacy referenced above. Plaintiffs are not talking so \nmuch about physical privacy in shielding their bodies from others in restrooms, changing \nfacilities, and overnight accommodations, but rather they are talking about informational \nprivacy in their gender identity and whether others know their gender identity and/or \nbiological sex.26  \nFor their part, Defendants largely did not discuss this argument in their opposition. \n \n26 Some transgender students are open about their gender identity. Others are not. Plaintiffs’ privacy claim \nis largely directed at those students who are transgender, but who have not disclosed that information to \nothers (i.e. Roe’s friends do not know she is a biological male; they only know her as female). Plaintiffs \nassert this “outing” of a transgender student’s status could happen in a variety of ways once S.B. 1100 takes \neffect. For example, if a student has been using one sex-specific restroom and now must use the other sex-\nspecific restroom (or an alternate restroom altogether), other students may realize the student is transgender. \nIt is true this may occur. To be sure, however, that same phenomenon of students discovering another’s \ngender identity may currently be happening as transgender students use facilities that coincide with their \ngender identity, but not their biological sex. Thus, to an extent, Plaintiffs’ privacy claim is related to \nphysical  privacy  because  physical  privacy  could  help  prevent  the  inadvertent  disclosure  of  one’s \ntransgender status. But again, the privacy claim here is more broadly directed at the information itself, not \nhow it may be disclosed.    \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 30 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 31 of 37\nThis led Plaintiffs to assert any opposition was waived. Defendants did discuss privacy \nmore in their final sur-reply, but only to emphasize that Plaintiffs have not put forth enough \nto support this claim. Defendants also went one step further and contended that even if \nPlaintiffs could show a specific injury in the disclosure of their gender identity, due process \ndoes not protect against that disclosure when competing interests are at stake. With little \nargument (and even less applicable caselaw) on this claim, the Court is left wanting. \nNonetheless, it finds Plaintiffs have, again, not met their initial burden of establishing a \nlikelihood of success on this privacy claim.  \n  A federal district court in California was recently faced with deciding whether \nchildren have a privacy interest in their gender identity for purposes of determining if \nteachers had to disclose any changes in gender identity to the children’s parents. Because \nthe challenged law was couched in terms of a state privacy right, the court looked to \nCalifornia state court decisions for guidance. It found that none “recogniz[ed] a child’s \nright to quasi-privacy about their gender identity expressions[.]” Mirabelli v. Olson, 2023 \nWL 5976992, at *10 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2023). The present case is, obviously, different, \nbut like the Mirabelli Court, the Court is not aware of any relevant and binding caselaw—\nin Idaho state or federal court—providing a true “privacy” interest in one’s gender identity. \n  Plaintiffs’ argument makes sense. Information about one’s sex, sexual orientation, \nand/or gender identity is personal and private. But that does not mean the disclosure of this \ninformation is a violation of due process because it does not implicate a fundamental liberty \ninterest.  See  Washington  v. Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  721  (1997). The Court finds \nPlaintiffs unlikely to succeed on their privacy claim.  \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 31 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 32 of 37\nB. Irreparable Harm \nWhile the merits-based prong is typically viewed as the most important element of \na preliminary injunction, see Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th \nCir. 2017), the issue of irreparable harm in this case is also important.  \nAs the Court has already discussed, harm may result irrespective of how it rules on \nPlaintiffs’ PI Motion today. Plaintiffs assert harm will befall transgender students because \nthey will be “outed” to their peers when they are forced to travel to different restrooms in \ntheir  schools,  change  in  different  facilities,  and  stay  in  different  overnight \naccommodations.  Defendants,  on  the  other  hand,  assert  these  accommodations  are \nsufficient and that failing to uphold S.B. 1100 could result in harm to those who do not \nidentify as transgender because they will be forced to share spaces, and expose their bodies, \nto persons of the opposite sex. The problem is both sides can only speculate on this front. \nAt the hearing, neither party was able to identify any specific instances of harm befalling \ntransgender, or cisgender, students in Idaho. The Court is sensitive to both side’s concerns; \nhowever, it cannot base its decision on what some students may subjectively feel or the \nspeculation of potential future harm. \nBoth sides spend a great deal of time discussing the science behind gender dysphoria \nand what S.B. 1100 might mean for transgender students. Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Stephanie \nBudge,  explains  that  transgender  students  may  suffer  depression,  anxiety,  or  other \npsychological  harms  if  they  are  not  allowed  to  socially  transition  and  use  facilities \nmatching their gender identity. On the other hand, Defendants’ expert, Dr. James Cantor, \nexplains the science actually demonstrates many of the concerns transgender individuals \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 32 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 33 of 37\nface dissipate with time and the harms Dr. Budge asserts often do not come to pass.27 \nAgain, however, neither side has any conclusive information about Idaho and any specific \nharm students—transgender or cisgender—have, or will, suffer.  \nThe Court understands why both sides focus much of their attention on their \ncompeting experts’ opinions. Nevertheless, as the Sixth Circuit recently noted, “expert \nconsensus, whether in the medical profession or elsewhere, is not the North Star of \nsubstantive due process, lest judges become spectators rather than referees in construing \nour Constitution.” Skrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688, at *12. Even if the Court had consistent \nexpert opinions in this case—which it does not—such would not mean it had to follow \nwhat the experts recommend. The Court’s duty is legal in nature. And while science and \nsociety has much to say on these topics, the Court’s focus is on the law.  \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a possibility of irreparable harm is insufficient. \nInstead, Plaintiffs must establish that irreparable harm is likely, and not just possible, in \nthe absence of an injunction. All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th \nCir. 2011); Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 23 (2008). Because neither \nside does little more than speculate that harms will occur, the Court finds this factor roughly \neven. Plaintiffs may experience some harm, but Defendants (and those who support S.B. \n \n27 Defendants assert Dr. Budge’s testimony is “biased” and should not be considered because she is a self-\ndescribed activist on transgender issues. They also claim Dr. Budge wholly ignores relevant studies that \ncontradict her own findings. In like manner, Plaintiffs take issue with some of Dr. Cantor’s findings and \nhis lack of experience treating individuals with gender dysphoria. Arguments regarding the sufficiency of \nexpert testimony are better left for later in the case. Suffice it to say, the Court will not delve into either \nexpert’s testimony at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. It has, frankly, not relied on this testimony \nbecause the science in this area is constantly evolving. And while the law is evolving to some degree as \nwell, the Court is an expert in the law, not science; thus, it has determined the most suitable outcome is to \nbase its decision on the law. It has given both experts’ testimony the weight it deems appropriate.      \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 33 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 34 of 37\n1100) may as well.     \nC. Balance of Equities and Public Interest   \nAs explained, because the Government is a party in this suit, the last two Winter \nfactors merge. See Jewell, 747 F.3d at 1092. \nAs is typically the case, neither party discussed either of these factors (together or \nseparately) in any amount of detail. Both simply argue their side prevails on the third and \nfourth prongs considering their success on the first prong. \nThere is no doubt the public has an interest in this issue. And the interest is \nsignificant on both sides. Whether the equities tip one way or the other likewise depends \non which position one takes—for or against S.B. 1100.  \nFor its part, the Court finds these factors are roughly even. Supporters and opponents \nof S.B. 1100 both have a vested interest in the outcome of this case.      \nVI. CONCLUSION \n  This is a difficult case. The Court previously prevented S.B. 1100 from taking effect \nbased upon the concept that maintaining the status quo—of no formal regulation—would \nallow the parties more time to fully address the difficult issues involved in this case. And \nwhile its decision today is still not a full adjudication on the merits, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have not shown they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. The Court \nis not implying Plaintiffs’ arguments are meritless—after all, some courts have upheld \nsimilar arguments to those Plaintiffs offer now. On the other hand, other courts have upheld \nthe arguments Defendants proffer. Indeed, this area of law (and societal policy) is evolving.  \nThe Court, however, must stay in its lane. It cannot provide guidance on how elected \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 34 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 35 of 37\nofficials should navigate these difficult situations. It can only decide whether the action \nthey have taken withstands constitutional scrutiny. As the Sixth Circuit aptly noted just a \nfew weeks ago with respect to regulations about medical care for transgender minors: \n“[L]ife-tenured judges construing a difficult-to-amend Constitution should be humble and \ncareful about announcing new substantive due process or equal protection rights that limit \naccountable elected officials from sorting out these medical, social, and policy challenges.” \nSkrmetti, 2023 WL 6321688 at *23. \n Ultimately,  the  Court  is  not  convinced  Plaintiffs  can  prevail  on  their  equal \nprotection claims because: 1) S.B. 1100 is based upon sex, not gender identity, and 2) \nprivacy  and  safety  are  important  government  interests  and  separating  these  types  of \nfacilities  on  the  basis  of  sex  is  “substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  those \nobjectives.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724.28 The state of Idaho has an interest in protecting the \nprivacy and safety of its youth while at school. It has written a law to achieve that goal, \nwhile also mandating a reasonable accommodation for any student who feels he or she \ncannot follow the law. That not all people agree with the law is the reality of living in a \npluralistic society where everyone cannot have everything they want according to how they \nsee the world. See Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. \nPlaintiffs likewise cannot show they are likely to prevail on the merits of their Title \n \n28 And the Court would reach this conclusion even if it were to assume, as Plaintiffs argue, that S.B. 1100 \ndiscriminates based on transgender status. That is, frankly, the whole point of this exercise. Under \nintermediate scrutiny, the government must show that it has a persuasive justification for the classification \nit has drawn. It has done so here regardless of which classification the Court uses—sex or transgender \nstatus. Thus, while there may be disagreement on the complicated, esoteric, and ever-evolving landscape \nof discrimination based on gender identity and whether that is the same as discrimination based on sex, it \nmatters not because privacy is a legitimate interest either way. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 35 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 36 of 37\nIX  claim  because  Title  IX  specifically  allows  for  sex-separate  facilities.  S.B.  1100, \ntherefore, does not violate Title IX, it adheres to it.   \nAnd finally, Plaintiffs have not shown they are likely to prevail on the merits of their \nprivacy claim because they have not demonstrated they have a protectable liberty interest \nin the nondisclosure of their gender identity. \nThus, while the Court finds the remaining Winter factors roughly even, it finds \nPlaintiffs have not prevailed on the critical first prong required to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction today.   \nThat  said,  Defendants  have  not  shown  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  entitled  to  full \ndismissal. While they move to dismiss all claims, Defendants do so in a perfunctory \nmanner, with little explanation. The idea seems to be that Plaintiffs’ claims are based on \nspeculative science and cannot withstand muster. As noted, however, the Court will not be \ndelving into the science behind the parties’ positions today. But the fact that other courts \nhave found merit in similar claims against the backdrop of regulations similar to S.B. 1100 \nweighs against finding that Plaintiffs’ claims are wholly implausible. The Court will not \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ claims at this time. \nBecause the Court’s decision today will take time to implement, the Court will \nextend the TRO for 21 days. This should provide enough time for school districts to \nidentify and designate restrooms, changing facilities, and overnight accommodations in a \nmanner consistent with S.B. 1100. Once the 21 days have elapsed, S.B. 1100 will be in full \nforce and effect. \n   \nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER – 36 \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00315-DCN   Document 60   Filed 10/12/23   Page 37 of 37\nVII.
