    "summary": "<p>This case was one of two that challenged D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department (DC Fire) rules prohibiting beards and long hair under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, a group of DC Fire employees with religious convictions prohibiting them from shaving their beards, brought this lawsuit against the District of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2005. The plaintiffs challenged a DC Fire rule which required all members to be clean shaven in the area where the sealing surface of their masks met their faces (no-beard rule). Specifically, they claimed that the no-beard rule violated the RFRA because it substantially burdened their exercise of religion and was not the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the no-beard rule violated their rights under the RFRA, a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting DC Fire from taking adverse action against any plaintiff because of their facial hair, and an order saying that plaintiffs who were assigned to administrative duties because of their facial hair be able to perform those duties on their regular schedules and be paid accordingly. The plaintiffs also sought compensatory damages and to be made whole with respect to pay, benefits, seniority, and all other terms and conditions of employment for all losses resulting from their removal from active duty due to their religious observances. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs asked the court for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the no-beard rule. On November 10, 2005, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion. The court enjoined the defendant from discharging, disciplining, retaliating against, or imposing any other adverse action upon the plaintiffs on account of the plaintiffs&rsquo; refusal to shave their beard. However, the court said that plaintiffs may be placed on administrative leave during that time. Furthermore, the court consolidated this case with Potter v. District of Columbia, another case challenging DC Fire&rsquo;s beard policies and in which there was already a preliminary injunction in place protecting other DC Dire employees from being discharged for wearing beards for religious reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Unlike the rest of the plaintiffs, two plaintiffs in this case shaved their beards, in disobedience to their religious beliefs, in order to remain on active duty. They did so because they could not afford to remain on administrative duty for an extended period of time, given the pay cut that accompanied it. As a result, they were not a part of the preliminary injunction phase of this case. Following the court&rsquo;s November grant of the preliminary injunction, these two plaintiffs filed a motion for reinstatement. In that motion, they asked the court to allow them to regrow their beards while remaining on regular duty because otherwise they would be put in the position of choosing between quitting their jobs or violating their religious beliefs for the indefinite future. The court denied their request on March 14, 2006, but it granted their motion for reinstatement. They appealed that denial on April 7, 2006, and on April 11, 2006, they moved in the district court for an injunction pending their appeal that would allow them to re-grow their beards and remain on active duty. The court denied that motion on April 18, 2006. The parties eventually agreed to voluntarily dismiss the appeal, and the D.C. Circuit accordingly dismissed on November 9, 2006. 2006 WL 3307275.</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on October 16, 2006. After the court granted plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend their complaint, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on August 22, 2007. The plaintiffs maintained that the policy violated the RFRA and the First Amendment, but they sought additional relief. Specifically, they asked the court to (i) make plaintiffs whole for losses resulting from their being removed from active duty because of their failure to adhere to the grooming policy and (ii) award compensatory damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2007, the court denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment. It found that D.C. Fire&rsquo;s policy violated the RFRA, and it directed the plaintiffs to file a form of order proposing appropriate further relief. On October 29, 2007, the court issued a permanent injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing the facial hair provisions of its policy against plaintiffs. It also ordered (i) that defendant restore to field duty each plaintiff who was assigned to administrative duty for violating the facial hair policy, (ii) that plaintiffs who shaved their facial hair in order to remain on field duty be allowed to regrow their beards, and (iii) that if any plaintiffs claimed lost income, benefits, or lost or forced sick leave as a result of violating the policy, the parties would confer and seek in good faith to agree upon remedies for such losses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2007, the defendant appealed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court on April 23, 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned in the district court to Judge Richard J. Leon, and the court referred the case to mediation on January 2, 2013. On October 27, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, in accordance with a settlement agreement between the parties. The court granted the motion on October 11, 2013, and it retained jurisdiction for limited purposes, including adjudicating any alleged violation of the parties&rsquo; settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In February 2020, D.C. Fire announced a new facial hair policy to conform with practices recommended by several agencies. The policy recommended against having facial hair so as to ensure a tight fit not only with facemasks but also with medical masks. It prohibited employees from having facial hair that came between the sealing surface of the face piece and the face or interfered with the valve function.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 7, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment of civil contempt, claiming that the parties had failed to reach a settlement agreement. on August 31, 2023, the court denied that motion on discretionary grounds. It found that although plaintiffs may have shown that D.C. Fire violated the court&rsquo;s order by enforcing the 2020 policy (which was nearly identical to the policy plaintiffs originally challenged) and returning plaintiffs to administrative duty, D.C. Fire acted in a reasonably cautious way, under unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances, to keep plaintiffs and the public it served safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. It therefore determined that defendant should not be considered a contemnor for its actions, especially since plaintiffs&rsquo; damages were likely to be de minimis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 2, 2023, the plaintiffs appealed the court&rsquo;s order denying their motion for judgment of civil contempt to the D.C. Circuit. The court issued its opinion on January 28, 2025. 126 F.4th 720. It found that the district court abused its discretion by misapplying the legal standards for civil contempt. The court explained that the district court could not exercise discretion in this case. Instead, it was required to determine whether D.C. Fire violated plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the 2007 injunction. Alternatively, the district court could have withheld judgment if it found that recognized defense to contempt applied, but violating an injunction &ldquo;in a reasonably cautious way&rdquo; was not a recognized defense to civil contempt. The court vacated the dismissal order and remanded to the district court. The case is ongoing as of April 20, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The court also consolidated this case with Potter v. District of Columbia, another case challenging D.C. Fire’s no-beard rule. On September 28, 2007, the court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs and issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the policy by defendants. In 2020, D.C. Fire issued a new grooming policy that was similar to its previous policy, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment of civil contempt. The district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion, but on appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that the district court had abused its discretion by misapplying the legal standards for a civil contempt judgment. On October 2, 2023, the D.C. Circuit remanded with instructions to the district court. The case is ongoing as of April 20, 2025.",

Wilson Building\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20004\nDefendant.\n_____________________________________\nCOMPLAINT\n(for injunctive relief and damages; violation of religious liberty)\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 2 of 15\n1.  This is an action to compel the District of Columbia Department of Fire and\nEmergency Medical Services (“Department” or “Fire Department”) to abide by its statutory\nobligation to respect and accommodate the religious practices of its employees.  The\nDepartment prohibits its employees from wearing beards.  The plaintiffs are six employees\nwho hold sincere religious convictions prohibiting them from shaving their beards.  Plaintiffs\n(and many others) have worked at the Department for many years without shaving, and have\nexperienced no safety problems.  Modern safety equipment makes it unnecessary to be clean-\nshaven in order to be safe.  The Department therefore cannot prove that its no-beard rule is\nessential to safety.  In the absence of such proof the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\nprohibits the Department from overriding plaintiffs’ religious convictions.\n2.  Just last month, in an essentially identical case styled Potter v. District of\nColumbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR), this Court entered a preliminary injunction protecting three\nFire Department employees from being discharged because they wear beards for religious\nreasons, and ordering the Department to allow them to take “fit tests” to show that they could\nsafely wear negative-pressure respirators despite their beards.  Disdaining this Court’s action,\nthe Fire Chief has announced that he will now proceed to discipline and discharge all other\nmembers of the Department who wear beards, no matter how sincere their religious reasons\nfor doing so.  Nor will he permit them to take fit tests before being discharged.  Injunctive\nrelief is necessary to protect the long-standing status quo and to prevent imminent and\nirreparable injury to plaintiffs’ religious rights.\nJurisdiction\n3.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n1343 because plaintiffs assert claims under federal law.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action is\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 3 of 15\nestablished by 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4.  Venue lies in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\nParties\n5.  Plaintiff Steven B. Chasin is employed as a paramedic by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for more than fifteen years.  He has worn a short beard for more than seventeen\nyears, as a sincere observance of his Jewish faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he will soon\nbe discharged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n6.  Plaintiff Kevin Conerly is employed as a firefighter by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for more than sixteen years.  He has worn a beard for approximately twenty-five\nyears, as a sincere observance of his Nazerite faith, which includes a vow not to shave.  He\nwore a beard during his service in the United States Army, 1980-1983, prior to joining the\nDepartment.  Absent relief from this Court, he will soon be discharged from the Department\nif he does not shave his beard.\n7.  Plaintiff Dwight Evans is employed as a paramedic by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for thirty years; there is no paramedic senior to him in the Department.  He has\nworn a beard for thirty-three years, including during his service in the United States Army\nprior to joining the Department.  Plaintiff Evans was a Baptist for most of his life, but\nbecame a Muslim in December 2004 and wears his neatly trimmed beard as one part of his\nsincere observance of his new religious faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he will soon be\ndischarged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 4 of 15\n8.  Plaintiff Shango Kwame Rashumaa is employed as a paramedic by the District of\nColumbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He was a member of the\nDepartment from 1999 to 2002, when he left to undertake a journey of personal and spiritual\ngrowth, traveling in Africa and the Caribbean and studying his spiritual and cultural heritage.\nAs part of his spiritual rebirth, he legally changed his name to what it is today.  As spiritual\nobservances, he follows a vegan diet, wears his hair in locks, covers his head, and does not\nshave his face.  He rejoined the Department in April 2004; he has not shaved, as a matter of\nsincere spiritual observance, since before that time.  Absent relief from this Court, he will\nsoon be discharged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n9.  Plaintiff Jasper W. Sterling is employed as a paramedic by the District of\nColumbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services. He has been a member of\nthe Department for fourteen years.  He has worn a beard for approximately twenty-four\nyears, including during his five years of service in the United States Air Force.  He wears his\nbeard as a sincere observance of his Muslim faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he will\nsoon be discharged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n10.  Plaintiff Eleon A. Baker is a sergeant with the District of Columbia Department\nof Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a D.C. firefighter for more than\ntwenty years, since June 1985.   He has worn a short beard, following the tenets of his\nNazerite faith, for about 19 years.  Absent relief from this Court, he will soon be discharged\nfrom the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n11.  Defendant District of Columbia is a municipal corporation of which the District\nof Columbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services is an agency.\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 5 of 15\nFacts\n12.  For at least thirty years, the Department has officially permitted its employees to\nwear 1/4-inch beards if they suffered from a medical condition known as pseudofolliculitis\nbarbae, also known as “PFB” or “razor bumps.”  Informally, the Department has allowed all\nemployees to wear such beards for at least twenty years.  During that time, hundreds of\nDepartment members have worn beards.  During that time, hundreds of Department members\nhave taken and passed official fit tests while wearing beards.  During all that time, there has\nnot been a single incident in which a member’s facial hair was responsible for a safety\nproblem.\n13.  Subsequent to the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in\nKennedy v. District of Columbia, 654 A.2d 847 (1994), all Department members were\nofficially permitted to wear 1/4-inch beards.  As a practical matter, the Department did not\nenforce the 1/4-inch limitation on the length of beards, and many members wore beards\nlonger than 1/4 inch.  Many Department members passed official fit tests while wearing\nbeards longer than 1/4 inch.  No member’s facial hair has ever been responsible for a safety\nproblem.\nFirefighters\n14.  While on a fireground, or in any other toxic atmosphere, firefighters protect\nthemselves from respiratory injury by wearing a “self-contained breathing apparatus”\n(SCBA) consisting of a face mask connected to an air tank.  The air tank provides a constant\nflow of pressurized clean air to the face mask, such that any imperfections in the fit between\na firefighter’s face and mask will result in a leakage of clean air to the outside atmosphere,\nrather than a leakage of toxic material into the face mask.\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 6 of 15\n15.  The presence of facial hair might or might not cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.  Other variables, such as a thin face, prominent cheekbones,\na long jaw or nose, or facial scars, might or might not also cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.\n16.  Because of the positive-pressure feature of the SCBA, an imperfect fit does not\ndirectly endanger a firefighter’s life or health or the safety of others.\n17.  A less perfect fit—whatever its cause—will result in a firefighter depleting his or\nher air supply somewhat faster than a more perfect fit.  Many other individual variables,\nincluding body weight, physical fitness, respiratory efficiency, and physiological reaction to\nstress, will also affect the speed with which a firefighter depletes his or her air supply.\n18.  There is no reason to believe that the presence or absence of facial hair will have\na greater effect on the speed with which a firefighter’s air supply is used than the firefighter’s\nbody weight, physical fitness, respiratory efficiency, or physiological reaction to stress.\nFirefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker do not deplete their air supply faster than their fellow\nfirefighters.\n19.  Firefighters with facial hair present no greater risk to themselves or others, when\nfighting fires or when operating in any hazardous atmosphere, than clean-shaven firefighters.\n20.  Firefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker have been working safely for more than\n36 combined years with their beards.\n21.  In the spring of 2001, then-D.C. Fire Chief Ronnie Few announced strict\nenforcement of the Department’s grooming policy, which prohibited (among other things)\nbeards longer than 1/4 inch, hair longer than the top of the shirt collar (for men only), and\nhead coverings (such as yarmulkes and kufis) that were not part of the official uniform.  Six\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 7 of 15\nfirefighters who, as a matter of religious observance, wore beards, long hair, and/or head\ncoverings, filed a civil action in this Court to protect their rights under the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  That action was styled  Potter v. District of\nColumbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR).\n22.  On June 22, 2001, this Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the\nDepartment from taking any action against the plaintiffs in the Potter case because of their\nbeards, long hair or head coverings.  With regard to beards, this Court’s order rested on its\nunderstanding that the positive-pressure feature of the breathing apparatus provided\nprotection for firefighters with facial hair.\n23.  For the next four years, the Department honored that injunction and, by order of\nthe Fire Chief (Special Order 48, 2001, dated June 26, 2001), exempted all other members of\nthe Department who “object[ed] on a religious basis to any portion of the grooming\nregulations” from complying with the portion of the grooming regulations to which they so\nobjected.\nEmergency Medical Service Personnel\n24.  In addition to firefighters, the Department employs approximately 200\nemergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who respond to emergency medical\ncalls in the District of Columbia.  Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel are not\ntrained or equipped to work in hazardous atmospheres.  Until some months after the terrorist\nattacks of September 11, 2001, the Department’s EMS personnel were not provided with, or\ntrained to use, respiratory protection apparatus.\n25.  Sometime in late 2001 or early 2002, the Department’s EMS personnel were\nprovided with face masks and “go-bags,” which contain a filter that, when fitted to the face\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 8 of 15\nmask, creates an air-purifying respirator (APR) that provides protection against certain\natmospheric hazards.\n26.  When these go-bags were issued, each emergency medical technician and\nparamedic was required to take a fit test to determine whether he or she could obtain a good\nseal.  Plaintiffs Chasin, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling, who are paramedics, each passed the\nfit test.  Each had a beard at the time.  Thirty to 40 of the approximately 200 emergency\nmedical service personnel also had beards at that time, and each passed the fit test.  Some\nclean-shaven personnel had difficulty passing the test, but after appropriate adjustments to\ntheir masks, everyone passed.\nGo-Bag Filters\n27.  Subsequently, the Department’s firefighters were also provided with go-bags.\n28.  A face mask fitted with a go-bag filter operates as negative-pressure air-purifying\nrespirator.  Because outside air is pulled through the filter by the user’s intake of breath,\noutside air could leak into the face mask in the event of a poor fit.\n29.  For this and other reasons, the respirator formed by a face mask and go-bag filter\nis not approved for use in a toxic atmosphere.  Department personnel are not permitted to\nwork in toxic atmospheres using their face masks and go-bag filters.\n30.  When the go-bags were distributed, Department personnel were advised that they\nwere intended for use in civil disturbance situations, for protection against non-lethal hazards\nsuch as tear gas, pepper spray, and the like.\n31. Department personnel are not required to, and do not, carry their face masks and\ngo-bags with them when they are off duty.  They are kept at the station house with members’\nother equipment.\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 9 of 15\nRecent Developments\n32.  On May 25, 2005, Fire Chief Thompson issued Special Order 20, Series 2005.\nThat order requires all members to be clean-shaven in the area where the sealing surface of\ntheir face masks meet their faces.  Because the sealing surface of a face mask meets the face\nin the same area where a beard grows, the effect of Special Order 20 is that no member may\nwear a beard.  Special Order 20 provides that disobedience will result in discharge.\n33.  At the time Special Order 20 was issued, Fire Chief Thompson also issued a\n“Notice to Persons Seeking Exemption to Special Order 20, 2005 for Religious Reasons.”\nThat notice stated:\nSpecial Order 20, 2005 does not provide for an exemption for religion or\nany other reason.  However, because of court proceedings related to this\nissue, the Department will honor requests for a religious exemption until\nthe court rules on this matter. These requests will no longer be honored\nwhen and if the court rules that federal law does not require religious\nbased exemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.  [Emphasis added.]\n34.  Pursuant to that memorandum, the Department continued to allow members who\nwere not plaintiffs in the Potter case to wear beards for religious reasons in June, July and\npart of August 2005.\n35.  This court has never ruled that that federal law does not require religiously-based\nexemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.  To the contrary, on August 11, 2005, this Court\nentered an additional preliminary injunction in the Potter case ordering the Department to\naccommodate the religious beliefs of the Potter plaintiffs by allowing them (in the first\ninstance) to take fit tests, even though Special Order 20 provides that members with facial\nhair may not take fit tests.\n36.  Reneging on his May 2005 Notice, on August 24, 2005, Fire Chief Thompson\nissued a new “Notice to Persons Seeking Exemption from Special Order 20 for Religious\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 10 of 15\nReasons,” stating that “[t]he Department is no longer honoring requests for a religious\nexemption,” and that “failure to comply with Special Order 20 shall result in disciplinary\naction as set forth in the order” regardless of the religious basis for a member’s wearing\nfacial hair.\n37.  Despite this Court’s August 11 order requiring fit tests for the Potter plaintiffs,\nthe Fire Chief will not permit other members with religious reasons for wearing beards to\ntake fit tests before being discharged.  Plaintiffs Chasen, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling will\nbe discharged despite having passed fit tests.\nNo Need to Burden Plaintiffs’ Exercise of Religion\n38.  Plaintiffs Kevin Conerly and Eleon Baker are firefighters with the Department.\nTheir Nazerite religious faith teaches them not to shave their beards, and they have worn\nbeards for approximately 25 and 19 years, respectively.  They are in every material respect\nsimilarly situated to the plaintiffs in the Potter case.\n39.  Plaintiffs Conerly and Baker can obtain adequate respiratory protection in any\nsituation in which they would be expected to work by wearing their self-contained breathing\napparatus.  There is no situation in which their go-bag filters would provide better protection.\n40.  Should they be required to use their go-bag filters, there is no reason to believe\nthat plaintiffs Conerly and Baker cannot obtain a good face mask seal, with facial hair, at this\ntime or in the future.\n41.  Plaintiffs Chasen, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling are paramedics.  Their religious\nbeliefs teach them not to shave their beards, and they have worn beards for approximately 17,\n33, 2 and 24 years, respectively.  They are neither trained nor permitted to work in toxic\natmospheres.  Plaintiffs Chasen, Evans and Sterling each passed a formal fit test when he was\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 11 of 15\nissued a face mask and filter in 2001 or 2002.  Plaintiff Rashumaa passed a fit test when he\nrejoined the Department in 2004.  Each was wearing a beard at the time.\n42.  There is no reason to believe that the plaintiffs Chasen, Evans, Rashumaa and\nSterling cannot obtain a good face mask seal, with facial hair, at this time or in the future.\n43.  The Department owns the equipment needed to conduct formal fit tests.  The cost\nto the Department of conducting fit tests on plaintiffs would be trivial.\n44.  Even in the event that a plaintiff could not pass a fit test—whether because of\nfacial hair or any other reason—alternative equipment is readily available that will provide\nhim with adequate respiratory protection in situations where the go-bag filter would be used.\n45.  The Department owns a number of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\nmanufactured by the same company that makes the face masks used by all Department\nmembers and the filters contained in the go-bags.  These PAPRs are compatible (or\n“interoperable”) with the Department’s other respiratory protection equipment.\n46.  A PAPR is similar to the APR formed by a face mask and go-bag filter, except\nthat in a PAPR a battery-operated fan pushes air through the filter.  A PAPR therefore creates\na positive-pressure atmosphere inside the face mask, so that any leakage will be outward.  A\nPAPR also eliminates the need for the user to operate the filter through his or her own\nrespiratory effort.  A PAPR therefore provides both better protection, and a longer work-\nspan, than an APR formed by a face mask and go-bag filter.\n47.  In the event that a plaintiff could not pass a fit test because of his religious\nobservance, use of a PAPR would provide him with at least as good a level of respiratory\nprotection as other Department members would obtain using their go-bag equipment, and\nwould enable him to work for longer than he could work using his go-bag equipment.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 12 of 15\n48.  The cost to the Department of issuing PAPRs to plaintiffs would be a minuscule\nfraction of the Department’s operating budget, which exceeds $150 million annually.\n49.  The Department has not considered, and cannot satisfy its burden of\ndemonstrating, that these or other accommodations will not satisfy its interest in safety while\nallowing plaintiffs to exercise their religious beliefs.\nHarm to Plaintiffs\n50.  Special Order 20 further provides that on the first day a member reports for duty\nwith facial hair he will be removed from field operations and ordered to shave, that on the\nsecond day a member reports for duty with facial hair he will be suspended for 12 duty hours,\nthat on the third day a member reports for duty with facial hair he will be suspended for 24\nduty hours, and that on the fourth day a member reports for duty with facial hair his\ntermination will be proposed.\n51.  On September 8, 2005, Plaintiff Conerly reported for duty for a fourth day with\nfacial hair and was proposed for termination.  Plaintiff Sterling anticipates that he will be\nproposed for termination on September 13.  Plaintiff Chasen anticipates that he will be\nproposed for termination on September 15.  Plaintiffs Evans and Rashumaa will follow\nshortly thereafter, unless they shave.\n52.  In the absence of injunctive relief by this Court, plaintiffs will soon be discharged\nfrom the Department.\n53.  Plaintiffs have been removed from field operations and placed on administrative\nduties because they have observed their religious obligations regarding facial hair and beards.\nWhile on administrative duty status, plaintiffs suffer a major loss of pay because of the\n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 13 of 15\nmanner in which Department personnel are compensated.  Plaintiffs also suffer the loss of\nbenefits and other terms and conditions of employment.\n54.  Plaintiffs have already suffered, and will continue to suffer, mental and emotional\ndistress because of defendant’s unlawful conduct.\nClaim for Relief\n38.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides, in pertinent part, that:\n(a) Government shall not substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability, except as provided in subsection (b) of this\nsection.\n(b)  Government  may  substantially  burden  a  person’s\nexercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the\nburden  to  the  person-  (1)  is  in  furtherance  of  a  compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n39.  The District of Columbia and its Department of Fire and Emergency Medical\nServices are subject to the commands of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n40.  The Department’s prohibition of beards substantially burdens plaintiffs’ exercise\nof their religious beliefs by forcing them to choose between their jobs and their faith.\n41.  The Department’s prohibition of beards is not the least restrictive means of\nsatisfying any compelling interest of the defendant.\n42.  A less restrictive means of satisfying the Department’s interest in safety is to\nallow plaintiffs to fit tests.  If a plaintiff can pass the fit test, he is as safe as any other\nmember of the Department.\n43.  Even if a plaintiff does not pass a fit test, a less restrictive means of satisfying the\nDepartment’s interest in safety is for plaintiffs to use SCBAs or PAPRs (as appropriate to\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 1      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 14 of 15\neach plaintiff’s job and as appropriate to the conditions of a particular situation).  Using an\nSCBA or a PAPR, a plaintiff is as safe as any other member of the Department.\n44.  The Department cannot satisfy its burden of showing that these or other feasible\naccommodations will not adequately satisfy its interest in safety.\n44.  The Department’s refusal to accommodate plaintiffs’ religious observances by\nusing less restrictive means to satisfy the Department’s interest in safety violates plaintiffs’\nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs ask that this Court:\n1.  Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that defendant’s prohibition of facial hair\nviolates plaintiffs’ rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act;\n2.  Enter preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the defendant, and its\nofficers and agents, from discharging any plaintiff, or imposing any sanction or other adverse\nconsequence against any plaintiff, on account of that plaintiff’s facial hair;\n3.  Order, with respect to any time period for which plaintiffs are assigned to\nadministrative duties on account of their facial hair, that they perform those duties on their\nregular schedules and be paid accordingly;\n4.

CHASIN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.      No. 05-cv-______ (JR)\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,\nDefendant.\n_____________________________________\nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nPursuant to Rule 65, Fed. R. Civ. P., plaintiffs hereby move for a preliminary\ninjunction preserving the status quo by prohibiting the District of Columbia Department of\nFire and Emergency Medical Services from disciplining, discharging, or otherwise\ndiscriminating or retaliating against them because they continue to wear beards in accordance\nwith the dictates of their religions; and ordering the Department, as preliminary relief, to\nallow them to take fit tests to show that they can achieve an adequate face mask seal while\nwearing their beards.\nThe defendant does not consent to the relief sought in this motion.\nPOINTS AND AUTHORITIES\nIntroduction\nThis Court is already familiar with both the facts and the legal issues presented in this\ncase because they are the same, in every material way, as the facts and issues presented in the\nrelated case of Potter v. District of Columbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR).\nDespite the fact that this Court just recently entered a preliminary injunction\nprotecting the plaintiffs in the Potter case from discipline or discharge on account of their\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 2 of 18\nreligiously-worn beards, the Fire Chief has decided that other members of the Department\nwill now be disciplined and discharged if they wear beards, no matter how sincere their\nreligious reasons for doing so and no matter how long they have served with honor and safety\nin the Department.  (One of the plaintiffs in this action is a thirty-year veteran of the\nDepartment and has worn his beard that entire time.)\nDespite the fact that this Court has just ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct requires the Department to administer fit tests to the plaintiffs in the Potter case to\ndetermine whether they can achieve an adequate face mask fit, the Fire Chief has decided\nthat he will not permit other Department members who wear beards for religious\nreasons—such as the plaintiffs here—to take fit tests for the same purpose.  Instead, he\nintends to discharge them regardless of whether they could achieve a perfectly adequate fit.\nIndeed, he intends to discharge them despite the fact that most of them have already passed\nformal fit tests with their beards.\nWhile this Court’s orders in Potter do not technically apply to individuals who are not\nplaintiffs in that case, the Fire Department has recognized, for the past four years, that other\nmembers with religiously-worn beards ought to be treated the same. Suddenly, however, in\nthe wake of this Court’s recent order requiring fit testing for the Potter plaintiffs, the Fire\nChief has moved to retaliate against all other similarly-situated members.\nOne of the plaintiffs in this case—a sixteen-year veteran firefighter—has already\nbeen written up for discharge.  The others will be in that situation within a matter of days.1\n                                                \n1 Defendant’s counsel (Mr. Utiger) has represented to plaintiffs’ counsel that no\nplaintiff will be finally discharged prior to September 16, and that this date can be extended\nif necessary for the Court to rule on this preliminary injunction motion, thereby enabling\nplaintiffs and the Court to proceed by a motion for a preliminary injunction rather than by an\napplication for a temporary restraining order.  Plaintiffs’ counsel appreciate that assurance.\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 3 of 18\nPerhaps the Fire Chief is afraid that if men with beards are allowed to take the fit test,\nthey will show that they can pass.  Perhaps the Fire Chief feels the need to demonstrate that\ndespite this Court’s orders, it is his word that is law in the Fire Department.2  Whatever the\nexplanation, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects the plaintiffs in this case, just as\nit protects the plaintiffs in Potter.  Accordingly, this Court should enter a preliminary\ninjunction preserving the long-standing status quo against this retaliatory and well-nigh\nirrational action by the Fire Chief.\nFacts\nA.  The Plaintiffs\nAs detailed in their respective declarations, the plaintiffs in this case are four\nparamedics and two firefighters employed by the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services\nDepartment, all of whom have sincere religious reasons for wearing beards.\nPlaintiff Steven B. Chasin has been a paramedic with the Department for more than\nfifteen years.3  He has worn a short, neatly-trimmed beard for more than seventeen years as a\nsincere observance of his Jewish faith.\nPlaintiff Kevin Conerly has been a firefighter with the Department for more than\nsixteen years; he has worn a beard for approximately twenty-five years, including during his\n                                                \n2 Indeed, by placing plaintiffs on administrative duties, the Fire Chief is already\ndemonstrating his ability to punish those who exercise their federal rights, because\nassignment to administrative duties imposes an immediate, heavy financial penalty on an\nemployee, as explained in detail in the Declarations of plaintiffs Chasin (¶ 10), Conerly (¶ 9)\nand Sterling (¶ 7).  At the same time, it serves no conceivable public safety purpose.  See\ninfra at 18 n.44.\n3 Paramedics are the highest level of emergency medical services personnel.  They are\nqualified to administer intravenous fluids, to use manual defibrillators, to perform\nendotracheal intubations, to interpret electrocardiograms, and use other advanced medical\nequipment and techniques.  See Chasin Decl. ¶ 2.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 4 of 18\nservice in the United States Army prior to joining the Department.  He wears his beard as a\nsincere observance of his Nazerite faith, which includes a vow not to shave.  On September\n8, 2005, he was recommended for discharge because he failed to report for duty clean-\nshaven.4\nPlaintiff Dwight Evans has been a paramedic with the Department for thirty years;\nthere is no paramedic senior to him in the Department.5  He has worn a beard for thirty-three\nyears, including during his service in the United States Army prior to joining the Department.\nPlaintiff Evans was a Baptist for most of his life, but became a Muslim in 2004 and wears his\nneatly trimmed beard as one part of his sincere observance of his new religious faith.\nPlaintiff Shango Kwame Rashumaa is also a paramedic.  He was a member of the\nDepartment from 1999 to 2002, when he left to undertake a journey of personal and spiritual\ngrowth, traveling in Africa and the Caribbean and studying his spiritual and cultural heritage.\nAs part of his spiritual rebirth, he legally changed his name to what it is today.  As spiritual\nobservances, he follows a vegan diet, wears his hair in locks, covers his head, and does not\nshave his face.  He rejoined the Department in April 2004; he has not shaved, as a matter of\nsincere spiritual observance, since before that time.\nPlaintiff Jasper W. Sterling has been a paramedic with the Department for fourteen\nyears and has worn a beard for approximately twenty-four years, including during his five\nyears of service in the United States Air Force.  He wears his beard in observance of his\nMuslim faith.\n                                                \n4 See Conerly Decl. ¶ 8; plaintiff Conerly has confirmed to counsel by telephone that\nthis occurred as expected.\n5 Plaintiff Evans will be eligible to retire when he reaches the age of 55 in April 2007,\nunless he is discharged for continuing to wear his beard.\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 5 of 18\nPlaintiff Eleon A. Baker is a sergeant with the Department.  He has been a D.C.\nfirefighter for more than twenty years and has worn a short beard, following the tenets of his\nNazerite faith, for about 19 years.\nB.  The Department’s Policy and Practice\nFor at least thirty years, the Department has officially permitted its employees to wear\n1/4-inch beards if they suffered from a medical condition known as pseudofolliculitis barbae,\nalso known as “PFB” or “razor bumps.”6  Informally, the Department has allowed all\nemployees to wear such beards for at least twenty years,7 and subsequent to the decision of\nthe District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Kennedy v. District of Columbia, 654 A.2d 847\n(1994), all Department members were officially permitted to wear such beards.8   During that\ntime, hundreds of Department members have worn beards, yet there has not been a single\nincident in which a member’s facial hair was responsible for a safety problem.9\nWhile on a fireground, or in any other toxic atmosphere, firefighters protect\nthemselves from respiratory injury by wearing a “self-contained breathing apparatus”\n                                                \n6 See Evans Decl. ¶ 2.\n7 See Baker Decl. ¶ 3.\n8 The gist of the Court of Appeals’ ruling was that since the Department recognized\nthat firefighters with pseudofolliculitis barbae could safely wear their breathing apparatus\nwith short beards, the ban on beards for other firefighters could not be justified as a matter of\nsafety.  Other firefighters accordingly had a right to wear such beards under the D.C. Human\nRights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on “personal appearance . . . including . . .\nhair style and beards,” unless such “style or manner of dress or personal grooming presents a\ndanger to the health, welfare or safety of any individual.”  D.C. Code § 2-1401.02 (22).\nAt the factfinding hearing in the Kennedy case, firefighter Kennedy demonstrated that\nhe could obtain a good face mask seal with his beard, and the judge so found.  See 654 A.2d\nat 855.\n9 See July 28, 2005, Declaration of Raymond Sneed, filed in Potter [R. Doc. 92].\nThis Court can take judicial notice of matters of record from other cases, see Coleman v.\nBurnett, 477 F.2d 1187, 1198 & n.50 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 6 of 18\n(SCBA) consisting of a face mask connected to an air tank.  The air tank provides a constant\nflow of pressurized clean air to the face mask, such that any imperfections in the fit between\na firefighter’s face and mask will result in a leakage of clean air to the outside atmosphere,\nrather than a leakage of toxic material into the face mask.10\nThe presence of facial hair might or might not cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.  Other variables, such as a thin face, prominent cheekbones,\na long jaw or nose, or facial scars, might or might not also cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.  But because of the positive-pressure feature of the SCBA,\nan imperfect fit does not directly endanger a firefighter’s life or health or the safety of\nothers.11\nA less perfect fit—whatever its cause—will result in a firefighter depleting his or her\nair supply somewhat faster than a more perfect fit.  However, many individual variables,\nincluding body weight, physical fitness, respiratory efficiency, and physiological reaction to\nstress, will also affect the speed with which a firefighter depletes his or her air supply, and\nthere is no reason to believe that facial hair will have a greater effect that these other\nvariables.12  Firefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker do not deplete their air supply faster\nthan their fellow firefighters, and they have been working safely for more than 36 combined\nyears with their beards.13  It follows that firefighters with facial hair present no greater risk to\nthemselves or others, when fighting fires or when operating in any toxic atmosphere, than\nother firefighters.\n                                                \n10 See Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 86 (testimony of Capt. Flint)\n11 See Declaration of Alexander Santora, filed in Potter [R. Doc. 2]\n12 Id.\n13 Conerly Decl. ¶ 5; Baker Decl. ¶ 5.\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 7 of 18\nIn the spring of 2001, then-Fire Chief Ronnie Few announced strict enforcement of\nthe Department’s grooming policy, which prohibited (among other things) beards longer than\n1/4 inch, hair longer than the top of the shirt collar (for men only), and head coverings (such\nas yarmulkes and kufis) that were not part of the official uniform.14  Six firefighters who\nwore beards, long hair, and/or religious headgear brought suit under the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act; that lawsuit was styled Potter v. District of Columbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR).\nFor the reasons outlined above, this Court was persuaded—at least tentatively— that\nthe plaintiffs’ religious practices did not present a safety problem, and entered a preliminary\ninjunction in that case prohibiting the Department from taking any action against the\nplaintiffs because of their beards, long hair or kufis.  Potter, Order of June 22, 2001 [R. Doc.\n34].  For the next four years, the Department honored that injunction and, by order of the Fire\nChief, exempted all other members of the Department who “object[ed] on a religious basis to\nany portion of the grooming regulations” from complying with the portion of the grooming\nregulations to which they so objected.15\nIn addition to firefighters, the Department employs approximately 200 emergency\nmedical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who respond to emergency medical calls in the\nDistrict of Columbia.16  Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel are not trained or\nequipped to work in hazardous atmospheres.

This Special Order is in the Potter record as Exhibit\nA to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [R. Doc. 2].\n15 Special Order 48, Series 2001 (June 26, 2001). This Special Order is in the Potter\nrecord as Exhibit A to the Defendant’s Response to The Court’s Order of May 13, 2004 [R.\nDoc. 51].\n16 Chasin Decl. ¶ 6.\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 8 of 18\nSeptember 11, 2001, the Department’s EMS personnel were not provided with, or trained to\nuse, respiratory protection apparatus.17\nSometime in late 2001 or early 2002, the Department’s EMS personnel were provided\nwith face masks and “go-bags,” which contain a filter that, when fitted to the face mask,\ncreates an air-purifying respirator (APR) that provides protection against certain atmospheric\nhazards.18  When these go-bags were issued, each emergency medical technician and\nparamedic was required to take a fit test to determine whether he or she could obtain a good\nseal.  Plaintiffs Chasin, Evans and Sterling, who were Department members at that time, all\npassed the fit test; each had a beard at that time.19  Thirty to forty of the approximately 200\nemergency medical service personnel also had beards at that time, and each of them passed\nthe fit test.20  Plaintiff Rashumaa was issued a go-bag when he rejoined the Department in\n2004; he passed the fit test at that time, with a beard.21  Subsequently, the Department’s\nfirefighters were also provided with go-bags.\nA face mask fitted with a go-bag filter operates as negative-pressure air-purifying\nrespirator.  Because outside air is pulled through the filter by the user’s intake of breath,\noutside air could leak into the face mask in the event of a poor fit.  For this and other reasons,\nthe respirator formed by a face mask and go-bag filter is not approved for use in a toxic\natmosphere.22  Department personnel are not permitted to work in toxic atmospheres using\ntheir face masks and go-bag filters; indeed, when the go-bags were distributed, Department\n                                                \n17  Chasin Decl. ¶ 5.\n18  Id.; Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 92 (Capt.

Flint).\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 9 of 18\npersonnel were advised that they were intended for use in civil disturbance situations, for\nprotection against non-lethal hazards such as tear gas, pepper spray, and the like.23\nDepartment personnel are not required to, and do not, carry their face masks and go-bags\nwith them when they are off duty.  They are kept at the station house with members’ other\nequipment.24\nC.  Recent Developments\nOn May 25, 2005, Fire Chief Thompson issued Special Order 20, Series 2005.  That\norder requires all members to be clean-shaven in the area where the sealing surface of their\nface masks meet their faces.25  Because the sealing surface of a face mask meets the face in\nthe same area where a beard grows, the effect of Special Order 20 is that no member may\nwear a beard.  Special Order 20 provides that disobedience will result in discharge.\nAt the time Special Order 20 was issued, Fire Chief Thompson also issued a “Notice\nto Persons Seeking Exemption to Special Order 20, 2005 for Religious Reasons.”  That\nnotice stated:\nSpecial Order 20, 2005 does not provide for an exemption for religion or\nany other reason.  However, because of court proceedings related to this\nissue, the Department will honor requests for a religious exemption until\nthe court rules on this matter. These requests will no longer be honored\nwhen and if the court rules that federal law does not require religious\nbased exemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.\nEmphasis added.26  Pursuant to that memorandum, the Department continued to allow\n                                                \n23  Chasin Decl. ¶ 5.\n24  Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 21 (Mr. Potter); 45 (Lt. Sneed).\n25 Special Order 20, 2005, is in the Potter record as Exhibit A to the Second\nDeclaration of Raymond Sneed [R. Doc. 73].\n26  This Notice is in the Potter Record as Exhibit B to the Second Declaration of\nRaymond Sneed [R. Doc. 73].\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 10 of 18\nmembers who were not plaintiffs in the Potter case to wear beards for religious reasons in\nJune, July and part of August 2005.\nThis court has never ruled that that “federal law does not require religiously-based\nexemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.”  To the contrary, on August 11, 2005, this Court\nentered an additional preliminary injunction in the Potter case ordering the Department to\naccommodate the religious beliefs of the Potter plaintiffs by allowing them (in the first\ninstance) to take fit tests,27 even though Special Order 20 provides that members with facial\nhair may not take fit tests.\nReneging on his May 2005 Notice, on August 24, 2005, the Fire Chief issued a new\n“Notice to Persons Seeking Exemption from Special Order 20 for Religious Reasons,”\nstating that “[t]he Department is no longer honoring requests for a religious exemption,” and\nthat “failure to comply with Special Order 20 shall result in disciplinary action as set forth in\nthe order” regardless of the religious basis for a member’s wearing facial hair.28  Thus,\ndespite this Court’s recent order requiring fit tests for the Potter plaintiffs, the Fire Chief will\nnot permit other members with religious reasons for wearing beards to take fit tests before\nbeing discharged.  Plaintiffs Chasen, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling will be discharged\ndespite having passed fit tests.  Unless the Department is again enjoined by this Court, all of\nthe plaintiffs in this case will soon be discharged unless they shave their beards.\nD.  Facts Relating to Accommodations\nFirefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker are in every material respect similarly\nsituated to the plaintiffs in the Potter case.  They can obtain adequate respiratory protection\n                                                \n27 Potter, Order of August 11, 2005 [R. Doc. 97].\n28 The Fire Chief’s Notice of August 24, 2005, is attached as Exhibit A to this\nmemorandum.\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 11 of 18\nin any situation in which they would be expected to work by wearing their self-contained\nbreathing apparatus.  There is no situation in which their go-bag filters would provide better\nprotection.29  Thus, no accommodation is needed aside from allowing them to use their\nSCBAs when they need respiratory protection.\nLikewise, paramedic plaintiffs Chasin, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling need no\naccommodation because respiratory protection did not become an essential part of their jobs\njust because they were issued go-bags.  They are not trained or authorized to work in toxic\nenvironments.30  Nor would their go-bag filters provide them with protection in such\nenvironments.31  In nearly four years since the go-bags were issued, no EMT or paramedic\nhas used one.32\nEven should the plaintiffs be required to use their go-bag filters, there is no reason to\nbelieve that they cannot obtain a good face mask seal, with facial hair, at this time or in the\nfuture.  Certainly that cannot be determined without giving them the opportunity to take a fit\ntest.33  Thus, if any further accommodation is needed, it may be adequate simply to allow\nthem to take fit tests, as this Court has already ordered in Potter.\nParamedic plaintiffs Chasen, Evans and Sterling each passed a formal fit test when he\nwas issued a face mask and filter in 2001 or 2002.  Plaintiff Rashumaa passed a fit test when\n                                                \n29  Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 83 (Ass’t Chief Fitzgerald) (“Q. And isn't\nit true that a self-contained breathing apparatus provides better protection than an air\npurifying respirator?  A. Absolutely.”).\n30 Chasin Decl. ¶ 5.\n31 Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 115 (Capt. Flint).\n32 Chasin Decl. ¶ 7.\n33 The Department already owns the equipment needed to conduct formal fit tests.\nThe cost to the Department of conducting fit tests on plaintiffs would be trivial.  See Tr. of\n30(b)(6) deposition of defendant in Potter, at 85-86.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 12 of 18\nhe rejoined the Department in 2004.  Each was wearing a beard at the time.34  Thus, on the\ncurrent record, the only reasonable conclusion is that each of them can obtain an adequate fit\nand can safely use the go-bag filter.\nFinally, even if one or more of the plaintiffs could not pass a fit test—whether\nbecause of facial hair or any other reason—alternative equipment is readily available that\nwill provide him with adequate respiratory protection in situations where the go-bag filter\nwould be used.\nThe Department already owns a number of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\nmanufactured by the same company that makes the face masks used by all Department\nmembers and the filters contained in the go-bags.  These PAPRs are compatible (or\n“interoperable”) with the Department’s other respiratory protection equipment and with the\nequipment of other departments in the region.35  A PAPR is similar to the APR formed by a\nface mask and go-bag filter, except that in a PAPR a battery-operated fan pushes air through\nthe filter.  A PAPR therefore creates a positive-pressure atmosphere inside the face mask, so\nthat any leakage will be outward.36  A PAPR also eliminates the need for the user to operate\nthe filter through his or her own respiratory effort.  A PAPR therefore provides both better\nprotection, and a longer work-span, than an APR formed by a face mask and go-bag filter.\nThus, in the event that a plaintiff could not pass a fit test because of his religious observance,\n                                                \n34 Chasin Decl. ¶ 6; Evans Decl. ¶ 3; Sterling Decl. ¶ 4; Rashumaa Decl. ¶ 2.\n35 Tr. of Aug. 1, 2005, hearing in Potter at 93 (Capt.

Flint]: In essence, yes, it does.”).\n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 13 of 18\nuse of a PAPR would provide him with at least as good a level of respiratory protection as\nother Department members would obtain using their go-bag equipment, and would enable\nhim to work for longer than he could work using his go-bag equipment.37\nArgument\nPlaintiffs satisfy the familiar standards for preliminary injunctive relief:  they have a\nsubstantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits, absent relief they will suffer irreparable\ninjury, an injunction will not impose substantial harm on the defendant, and the public\ninterest favors relief.  See, e.g., WMATC v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir.\n1977).  Those conclusions follow ineluctably from the preliminary injunctions already issued\nby this Court—and still in effect—in the Potter case, for the two cases are materially\nindistinguishable.\nA.  Likelihood of Success\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides, in pertinent part, that:\n(a) Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of\nreligion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,\nexcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n(b) Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion\nonly if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.\n                                                \n37 The cost to the Department of issuing PAPRs to plaintiffs would be a minuscule\nfraction of the Department’s operating budget, which exceeds $150 million annually. See\nDistrict of Columbia FY 2006 Proposed Budget and Financial Plan, at p. C-25 (available at\nhttp://cfo.dc.gov/cfo/cwp/view,a,1321,q,589949,cfoNav,%7C33210%7C.asp).\nThe alternatives discussed here are presented for purposes of plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction.  They are not the only accommodations that may be available, and\nRFRA requires the Department carry the burden of showing that no accommodations are\npossible.\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 14 of 18\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.  In other words, if there is a feasible way of satisfying both the\ngovernment’s interest (here, the interest in safety) and the individual’s religious exercise\n(here, wearing a beard), that must be done.  The government cannot simply ignore such a\nfeasible accommodation because it prefers to enforce its rules uniformly on everyone.38\nThe accommodations that will satisfy both needs are obvious here, and have been\ndiscussed above.  This Court has already ordered one of them in Potter—allowing plaintiffs\nto take the fit test.  If they pass, they will have shown that they can get an adequate seal, and\nare as safe as any other members of the Department.  The defendant’s unwillingness even to\nallow the plaintiffs in this case to take fit tests—particularly when this Court has already\nordered the defendant to give fit tests to the Potter plaintiffs, and when most of the plaintiffs\nin this case have already passed formal fit tests—can only be characterized as irrational and\npunitive.39  At a minimum, the Court should enter a parallel injunction in this case. 40\n                                                \n38  Indeed, a government agency’s refusal to accommodate the religious exercises of\nits employees was the precise issue that led to the enactment of the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act.  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 512-516 (1997) (noting that\nRFRA was enacted to legislatively “overrule” Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872\n(1990), which had upheld an employer’s discharge of two Native American employees for\ntheir religiously-motivated use of peyote).\nThe fact that plaintiff Rashumaa’s spiritual beliefs are not associated with an\norganized religion of course does not lessen the protection to which his sincere beliefs are\nentitled.  See, e.g., Frazee v. Illinois Dep’t of Employment Security, 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989)\n(“we reject the notion that to claim the protection of the Free Exercise Clause, one must be\nresponding to the commands of a particular religious organization.”).\n39 Perhaps this is not quite fair, as it would be rational for the Fire Chief to seek to\nprevent a demonstration that his no-beards policy is unnecessary.\n40  Plaintiffs have some reason to think that the defendant may argue that the\ndifference between this case and Potter is that the plaintiffs’ beards in Potter are “mature,”\nwhile the plaintiffs in this case trim their beards.  Such an argument would be unavailing\nbecause there is no way to know whether all, or some, or none of the plaintiffs in the two\ncases can pass a fit test without allowing them all to take the fit test.  Furthermore, if it is the\ncase that longer beards are better able to achieve a good seal, one or more of the plaintiffs in\nthis case would be happy to allow his beard to grow longer, in order to be safer.\n14\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 15 of 18\nEven if one or more plaintiffs is unable to pass a fit test, the needs of both parties can\nstill be fully and easily satisfied through the issuance of powered air-purifying respirators\n(PAPRs) to the plaintiffs for their go-bags.  As explained above, a PAPR is similar to, but\nbetter than, the APR formed by the face mask and the go-bag filter.  In particular, it turns the\nnegative-pressure APR into a positive-pressure system, and thus prevents any inward leakage\nof harmful material just as an SCBA does.  The Department already has such PAPRs that are\ncompatible (or “interoperable”) with its other respiratory equipment.  It would be a simple\nmatter for the plaintiffs to keep PAPRs in their go-bags for use in the unlikely event that they\nmight be needed.\nBecause defendant cannot demonstrate that it is necessary to discharge the plaintiffs\nin order to satisfy its interest in safety, it is likely that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits.\nB.  Irreparable Injury\nAs this Court easily concluded in Potter, forcing plaintiffs to give up their jobs and\ncareers of many years standing in order to observe their religions—particularly when no such\nchoice is required in order to protect anyone’s safety—constitutes irreparable injury.  See\nPreliminary Injunction Order, June 22, 2001 [R. Doc. 34].\nC.  Harm to Defendant\nThe preliminary injunction sought here would preserve the longtime status quo.\nWhile employed by the Department, plaintiff Evans has worn his beard for thirty years,\nplaintiff Baker for nineteen years, plaintiff Conerly for sixteen years, plaintiff Chasin for\nfifteen years, plaintiff Sterling for fourteen years and plaintiff Rashumaa since his return to\nthe Department in 2004.  It is the Department that seeks to upset the status quo here, for\nreasons that make no sense.\n15\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 16 of 18\nThe Department has operated for more than thirty years with bearded firefighters and\nemergency medical personnel, without a single beard-related safety incident.  After this\nCourt issued a preliminary injunction in Potter on June 22, 2001, the Department operated\nsafely—and voluntarily allowed many other members with beards to continue on active\nduty—for more than four years before even getting around to issuing its new policy\nprohibiting beards in June 2005.  Even after issuing that new policy, the Department\nvoluntarily did not discipline or discharge members who had religious reasons to wear beards\nbut who were not plaintiffs in the Potter case during June, July, and most of August this year.\nNothing changed in late August except that this Court ruled—in the Potter plaintiffs’\nfavor—that the Department must allow them to take fit tests, must allow them to remain on\nthe payroll until they take those tests, and must allow them to remain on active duty if they\npass.\nThe Department’s voluntary actions for the past thirty years, the past four years, and\nthe past three months, show that the Department will suffer no harm if it is ordered to treat\nthe plaintiffs in this case in exactly the same manner as the plaintiffs in Potter.  What\nplaintiffs seek is truly an injunction preserving the longtime status quo.\nD.  The Public Interest\nIn enacting RFRA, Congress found that:\n(1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an\nunalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the\nConstitution;\n(2) laws “neutral” toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as\nlaws intended to interfere with religious exercise; [and]\n (3) governments should not substantially burden religious exercise without\ncompelling justification.\n16\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 17 of 18\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a).  In the absence of any argument by the defendant that RFRA is\nunconstitutional, this explicit declaration by the legislature defines the applicable public\npolicy here.  And as the defendant cannot show a “compelling justification” for discharging\nthese plaintiffs after their cumulative 99 years of faithful service, the public interest here is\nserved by maintaining the status quo and by giving the plaintiffs the opportunity to show that\nthey can continue to serve safely while still practicing their religions.\nRequested Relief\nThe proposed order that is filed herewith contains three items of relief:\n—It orders the Department to allow plaintiffs to take fit tests.  This relief should be\ngranted for the same reason it was granted in Potter.\n—It prohibits the Department from disciplining or discharging the plaintiffs, pending\na final decision from this Court, and orders the Department to cancel any disciplinary Trial\nBoards already scheduled.  This relief should be granted as a straightforward matter of\npreserving the status quo.  Disciplinary proceedings are already underway against several\nplaintiffs and will probably be underway against all plaintiffs before this Court can act on\nthis motion.41  Those proceedings should be halted.\n—Finally, it provides that if a plaintiff is assigned to administrative duties, he shall\nserve on his regular duty schedule and shall be paid accordingly.  As explained in plaintiffs’\ndeclarations, by putting plaintiffs on administrative duties the Fire Chief has imposed a\nsubstantial financial penalty on their exercise of religion.42  If the Department’s real purpose\nin assigning plaintiffs to administrative duties is to somehow protect public safety, then the\n                                                \n41 See Chasen Decl. ¶ 9; Conerly Decl. ¶ 8; Evans Decl. ¶ 6; Sterling Decl. ¶ 6; Baker\nDecl. ¶ 8.\n42 See Chasin Decl. ¶ 10; Conerly Decl. ¶ 9; Sterling Decl. ¶ 7.\n17\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 3      Filed 09/09/2005     Page 18 of 18\nDepartment has no interest in cutting their pay and should not oppose allowing them to work\ntheir usual schedules.  If the Department’s real purpose—as plaintiffs believe—is punitive,\nthen this Court should protect plaintiffs from financial punishment, pendente lite.43\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the plaintiffs’ motion should be granted and a preliminary\ninjunction should be issued.\nRespectfully submitted,\n_____________________________________________________________________\nArthur B.

Defendant’s only safety concern (as articulated in Potter) is that\nplaintiffs will (in defendant’s view) be unsafe in the unlikely event of a catastrophic\nemergency where the go-bag masks have to be used.  By defendant’s own reasoning,\ntherefore, the public safety could be fully protected while this litigation continues by keeping\nthe plaintiffs (in this case and in Potter) on regular active duty but requiring them not to\nparticipate in field operations in the event of a catastrophic emergency where the go-bag\nmasks have to be used.\nIf defendants were free to discharge plaintiffs and hire and train replacements, that\nwould be one thing.  But so long as plaintiffs remain on the payroll, it makes no sense at\nall—except punitively—to require them to sit at a station house five days a week doing\nnothing, rather than allowing them to do the life saving jobs for which they are so well\ntrained and experienced.\n18",

Shortly thereafter the \n                                                           \n2 Of the original six Potter plaintiffs, only three are still employed by FEMS and currently involved in this \nlitigation. Plaintiff Umarani did not pass any of the fit-tests directed in the Court’s August 11, 2005 order \nand did not move for reinstatement, and was not ordered reinstated by the Court.  \n  3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 4 of 9\nDistrict effectively abandoned this grooming policy and the Potter case became dormant.  \nIn early 2005 the FEMS expressed its intent to begin enforcement of a safety based \npolicy that precluded the face-fit testing of fire-fighters and Emergency Medical Service \n(“EMS”) personnel who have facial hair at the point where the face piece seals to the \nface.  Potter plaintiffs brought a series of motion’s aimed at stopping the FEMS from \nenforcing this policy and both parties filed dispositive motions.   \nOn August 1, 2005 the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the issues involved \nand on August 11, 2005 issued an order granting plaintiffs  preliminary injunctive relief \nallowing the District to remove the Potter plaintiffs from field duty but preventing the \nDistrict from discharging plaintiffs, the effect being to place plaintiffs on administrative \nduties.3  The Court also ordered that the District allow the plaintiffs the opportunity to \ntake face-fit tests over a series of months to demonstrate that they could consistently pass \nthe required face-fit tests while wearing beards.    \nOn September 9, 2005 the Chasin plaintiffs, six EMS workers, filed a complaint \nand motion for preliminary injunction challenging the application of the District’s face-fit \npolicy on grounds identical to those presented in Potter. After oral argument, the Court \ngranted in part plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction providing relief identical to \nthat awarded the Potter plaintiffs on August 11, 2005 \nIn accordance with the preliminary injunction in this case the District conducted a \nseries of face-fit tests at approximately 30 day intervals over the course of four months.  \nAt the conclusion of the tests, two of the Potter plaintiffs and all of the Chasin plaintiffs \n                                                           \n3 All other pending motion were denied without prejudice.   \n  4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 5 of 9\nmoved for reinstatement.4  The Court granted the motions of Potter plaintiffs Ali and \nPotter and Chasin plaintiffs Rashumma, Sterling, Chasin and Conerly.  As a condition of \nreinstatement the Court ordered that each of the above plaintiffs take and pass a face-fit \ntest every 30 days.  The District has appealed these orders.  \nArgument \nIn order to obtain a stay, a party must satisfy each prong of the following four-part \ntest: (1) there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the party will suffer \nirreparable harm if a stay is denied; (3) the issuance of a stay will not cause substantial \nharm to other parties; and (4) the public interest will be served by the issuance of the stay. \nUnited  States  v.

Cir. 1998). \nThe District meets each element of this four-part test, and a stay should be granted. \n \n                                                           \n4 In effect, plaintiffs moved to modify the Court’s earlier preliminary injunctions of August 11, 2005 \n(Potter) and November 10, 2005 (Chasin).  \n  5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 6 of 9\nLikelihood of Success on the Merits \nAs set forth in the District’s opposition to plaintiffs’ motions for reinstatement, \nwhich is incorporated herein by reference, the unopposed expert testimony in this case is \nthat facial hair at the point of seal on a negative pressure face-piece is dangerous.  Further, \nthe effect of beards on face-fit is highly variable from donning to donning.  The fact that any \ngiven plaintiff had passed face-fits in the past wearing a beard does not demonstrate he will \nbe able to pass at any given time in the future.   In fact, two of the Chasin plaintiffs ordered \nto be reinstated, Shango Kwame Rashumma, and Kevin Conerly, failed face-fit tests on \nMarch 23, 2006 and March 27, 2006 after having passed three prior tests with marginal \nscores.5  The District has fully met its burden of demonstrating that it has a compelling \ninterest in enforcing its face-fit testing policy and that it is filling that need through the least \nburdensome means possible.     \nEven if the Court considers likelihood of success on the merits a close call, the other \nfactors strongly favor the District and justify the stay requested pending appeal. \nIrreparable Harm \nThe effect of the Court’s orders of March 20, 2006 is to put back on field duty four \nindividuals who, if faced with a situation where they are required to wear a negative \npressure mask, may not be able to fulfill their duties safely.   At the very least, the factual \nrecord in this case establishes that the weight of governmental regulations, industry \nstandards, and scientific studies support the proposition that it is unsafe to allow facial hair \nat the point of seal of face-pieces.  Each of the plaintiffs granted reinstatement pose, at the \nvery least, a potential risk to themselves, their co-workers and the general public if allowed \n                                                           \n5 Consistent with the directive of the Court at the March 14, 2006 oral argument, Messr. Rashuuma and \nConerly  will not be placed back on field duty.      \n  6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 7 of 9\nback on field duty.  It may be, indeed it is probable and certainly hoped for, that no event \nnecessitating the wearing of a negative pressure mask will occur during the pending appeal \nof the Court’s March 20, 2006 Orders.  But if it does and plaintiffs fail to achieve an \nadequate seal on their face-piece because of their beards, the potential harm could be the \nloss of life.  Even a small risk of the ultimate irreparable harm vastly out-weighs plaintiffs’ \nloss of overtime pay.  \nIssuance of a Stay Will Not Cause Plaintiffs Substantial Harm \nThe sole “harm” alleged by the plaintiffs in their motions for reinstatement is a loss \nof overtime pay while they are on administrative duty.  That there can be no irreparable \nharm from financial losses, even if substantial, has been firmly established by the \nSupreme Court, the D.C. Circuit, and nearly every federal court of appeals. That \noverwhelming precedent holds that loss of income and its attendant financial \nconsequences do not, as a matter of law, constitute irreparable harm. Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U.S. at 90–91; Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n, 259 F.2d at 925; Davenport, 166 \nF.3d at 367; Chilcott v. Orr, 747 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1984); Jayaraj v.

Shoshone \nRiver Power, Inc., 805 F.2d 351, 355 (10th Cir. 1986);  Lifestar Ambulance Serv. v. \n  7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 8 of 9\nUnited States, 365 F.3d 1293, 1296 n.5 (11th Cir. 2004);  Mikohn Gaming Corp. v. Acres \nGaming, 165 F.3d 891, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1998). \nHere, should this Court grant the District’s stay motion pending appeal, plaintiffs’ \nwill continue to receive their full regular salaries.  All they will lose is over-time pay.  \nSuch a loss is simply not legal  irreparable harm.  Even if it were, it would be insufficient \nto off-set the District’s safety concerns.  \nHarm to the Public \nThe citizens of the District have a right to be protected in an emergency by fire-\nfighters and emergency medical service personnel as prepared as possible.  In the case of \na major release of an inhalation contaminant that means personnel equipped to wear \nnegative pressure masks for extended periods of time without themselves becoming \ncasualties.  This is best accomplished by allowing the FEMS to enforce its safety based, \nOSHA mandated, face-fit policy, at least pending appeal. \nIn the Alternative the Court Should Modify It’s Orders Pending Appeal \nShould the Court decide not to stay its March 20, 2006 Order’s pending appeal, \nthe District requests that the Court modify its orders to narrowly tailor the relief given to \nthe irreparable harm alleged by the plaintiffs.  As noted above, the sole harm identified \nby the plaintiffs is a loss of overtime pay.  Should the Court decide not to stay the March \n20, 2006 Orders in their entirety, the District asks that the Court modify the Orders to \nonly require that the District pay plaintiffs’ overtime they would otherwise have earned, \npending appeal.  Such a modification will remove any possible irreparable harm to \nplaintiffs’ without endangering the citizens of the District of Columbia.          \n \n  8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 26      Filed 03/28/2006     Page 9 of 9\nConclusion \nFor all these reasons, this Court should stay its Orders of March 20, 2006 pending \nappeal.  In the alternative, the Court should modify its orders to only require that the \nDistrict pay plaintiffs overtime pay they would otherwise have been able to earn pending \nappeal.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n          ROBERT J.

CHASIN, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.      No. 05-cv-1792 (JR)\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,\nDefendant.\n___________________________________________________\nPLAINTIFFS EVANS’ AND BAKER’S MOTION\nFOR INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c), plaintiffs Dwight Evans and Eleon Baker hereby\nmove for an injunction pending appeal of this Court’s oral order of March 14, 2006,\ndenying their motion for a preliminary injunction permitting them to re-grow their beards\nwhile remaining on active duty.  The defendant does not consent to the relief requested in\nthis motion.\nBackground\nUnlike the other four plaintiffs in this case, paramedic Dwight Evans and\nfirefighter Sgt. Eleon Baker have been on active duty in recent months because they\nshaved their beards, in disobedience to their sincerely held religious beliefs.  They took\nthis drastic step in order to return to active duty work, because they could not afford to\nremain on “administrative duty” for an extended period of time, given the serious\nreduction in pay that administrative duty entails.  See Second Declaration of Dwight\nEvans; Second Declaration of Eleon Baker.1\n                                                \n1  Those previously-filed declarations [14] are being re-filed with this motion for\nthe Court’s convenience.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 2 of 7\nAs part of plaintiffs’ motion for reinstatement, plaintiffs Evans and Baker asked\nthe Court to allow them to re-grow their beards, while remaining on regular duty and\ntaking fit tests, “because otherwise they will be put in the cruel position of being forced\nto choose between quitting their jobs (which they have held for more than 30 and 20\nyears, respectively) or violating their religious beliefs for the indefinite future, as they\nremain unable to take a major cut in pay for a period of three months or longer.”  Motion\nfor Reinstatement [14] at 4.2  The requested relief would have put these two plaintiffs in\nthe same position as the other Chasin plaintiffs, following the Court’s March 20, 2006,\norder.\nHowever, at the conclusion of the March 14 hearing in this case, the Court denied\nthe relief requested by these two plaintiffs.  See Transcript of Mar. 14 Hearing [25] at 52-\n53.3  Plaintiffs Evans and Baker have filed an appeal from that ruling [28], and now seek\nan injunction allowing them to re-grow their beards while continuing to serve in field\noperations, subject to monthly fit testing, pending appeal.\nPoints and Authorities\nIn order to obtain an injunction pending appeal, a party must show “(1) that it has\na substantial likelihood of success on the merits;  (2) that it will suffer irreparable injury\nif the stay is denied;  (3) that issuance of the stay will not cause substantial harm to other\n                                                \n2  In fact, the other Chasin plaintiffs were forced to remain on administrative duty\nat low pay for more than five months between the preliminary injunction hearing on\nOctober 11, 2005, and the order directing their reinstatement to regular duty on March\n20, 2006.\n3  The Court’s only stated reason was “they’ve shaven, they’re out of the game for\nthe preliminary injunction phase.”  Tr. 53.  In order that the Court’s order regarding\nplaintiffs Evans and Baker will appear on the docket, plaintiffs respectfully suggest that\nthe Court enter a written order reflecting its oral ruling.  For the Court’s convenience, we\nhave attached to this motion a draft order reflecting the Court’s oral ruling.\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 3 of 7\nparties;  and (4) that the public interest will be served by issuance of the stay.” United\nStates v. Philip Morris, Inc., 314 F.3d 612, 617 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing Washington\nMetro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\nPlaintiffs Evans and Baker have made the necessary showing.\n1.  Plaintiffs Evans and Baker are likely to succeed in their appeal. \nPlaintiffs Evans and Baker are likely to succeed in their appeal because excluding\nthem from the relief given to the rest of the Chasin plaintiffs perpetuates a violation of\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) by the District of Columbia.\nThe key point to bear in mind is that under RFRA, it is the government’s burden\nto show, with evidence, that its action burdening a person’s exercise of religion is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.  42 U.S.C. §§\n2000bb-1(b); 2000bb-2(3).  The compelling interest involved in this case is safety, but\nthere is no factual evidence in this record to support the government’s theory that\nplaintiffs Evans and Baker are unsafe because they cannot consistently pass a face mask\nfit test.  The factual evidence is just the opposite.\nRegarding plaintiffs Evans and Baker themselves, the evidence is that Paramedic\nEvans has successfully passed three fit tests while wearing his beard, and has never failed\na fit test; Firefighter Sgt. Baker has successfully passed one fit test while wearing his\nbeard, and has also never failed a fit test.4  The evidence regarding the plaintiffs as a\n                                                \n4  Paramedic Evans passed fit tests with his beard in November and December\n2006 with scores of 6960 and 13,700, respectively.  See fit test results attached to\nDeclaration of Jessica Langley, filed January 12, 2006 [14].  He had previously passed a\nfit test with his beard when he was first issued a face mask in late 2001 or early 2002.\nSee Declaration of Dwight Evans, ¶ 3 [3].\n  Sergeant Baker passed the fit test with his beard in July, 2005, as part of the\nDepartment-wide fit testing that was conducted at that time.  See Declaration of Eleon\nBaker, ¶ 6 [3].  Of course, clean-shaven firefighters who passed the fit test at that time\nhave not been required to show that they can again pass the fit test between then and now.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 4 of 7\n whole supports the same conclusion, as most of the plaintiffs in this case and the Potter\ncase have successfully passed their fit tests on multiple occasions while wearing their\nbeards.5\nThe fact that there are not a greater number of fit test results for plaintiffs Evans\nand Baker cannot be held against them, for in the absence of evidence it is the Fire\nDepartment that cannot carry its burden.  Moreover, it is the Department that has refused\nto conduct fit tests on bearded firefighters and paramedics; the Department has no one to\nblame but itself for the absence of the evidence that—according to its hypothesis—would\nenable it to prove its case.\nOn the current state of the record, therefore, plaintiffs Evans and Baker are likely\nto succeed in their appeal.\n2.  Plaintiffs Evans and Baker will suffer irreparable injury\n     absent an injunction.\nIn the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress authorized the courts to enter\n“appropriate relief” against the government to protect individuals in the exercise of their\nreligious beliefs.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c).  It has never been doubted that “appropriate\nrelief” included injunctive relief,6 and thus Congress necessarily recognized that being\nforced by the government to violate one’s religious beliefs constitutes irreparable injury.\nThat congressional determination is entitled to respect here, just as it would be in any\nother context (e.g., antitrust or patent law) where Congress authorizes injunctive relief for\nthe violation of statutory standards.  This Court has applied that standard in this case by\n                                                \n5  See fit test results attached to plaintiffs’ motions for reinstatement [Potter 103;\nChasin 14].\n6  The only uncertainly was whether it also included money damages, see, e.g.,\nJama v. INS, 343 F. Supp. 2d 338, 371-76 (D.N.J. 2004).\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 5 of 7\ngranting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs who showed that they could pass a series of fit\ntests between October 2005 and January 2006.  See Order of March 20, 2006 [23].\nThe uncontradicted evidence in the record shows that in the absence of an\ninjunction permitting them to re-grow their beards while remaining on active duty,\nplaintiffs Evans and Baker will never have an opportunity to demonstrate that they can\nrepeatedly pass fit tests with their beards, because they cannot afford the substantial loss\nof pay that would be involved in going on administrative duty for four or five months in\norder to take those tests.  See Second Declaration of Dwight Evans; Second Declaration\nof Eleon Baker.  Thus, the Court’s denial of their motion to remain on active duty while\nre-growing their beards means that plaintiffs Evans and Baker have been suffering\nirreparable harm, and will continue to suffer irreparable harm, because they are forced to\nviolate their religious beliefs every day in order to remain on the job and earn the income\nthey need to support their households.7\n3.  Entry of an injunction pending appeal will not cause\n     substantial harm to the District of Columbia.\nIt is vanishingly unlikely that substantial harm will befall the District of Columbia\nif the Court allows plaintiffs Baker and Evans to remain on active duty and re-grow their\nbeards—subject to passing a fit test every 30 days—while their appeal is pending.  \nRegarding Mr. Evans, the Court is aware that no paramedic has ever been\nrequired to use his facemask on the job.  Declaration of Steven B. Chasin, ¶ 7 [3].\nParamedics are not trained to enter hazardous IDLH atmospheres, and are not authorized\nto do so.  Id., ¶ 5.  Mr. Evans has passed three consecutive fit tests with his beard, with\n                                                \n7 As the Court knows, it is uncontested that plaintiffs’ sincere religious beliefs\nrequire them to wear beards.  See Declaration of Dwight Evans [3]; Declaration of Eleon\nBaker [3].\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 6 of 7\nvery high scores on the two tests for which we know the scores.  See footnote 4, supra.\nNo serious argument can be made that the District of Columbia will be harmed by\nallowing Mr. Evans—a 30-year D.C. Fire Department veteran—to remain on the job with\nthe beard that he wore safely as a D.C. paramedic from 1975 until last summer.  See\nDeclaration of Dwight Evans [3].\nLikewise, no serious argument can be made that District of Columbia will be\nharmed by allowing Sgt. Baker to remain on the job and re-grow his beard, subject to fit\ntesting every 30 days.  Sgt. Baker wore his beard as a D.C. firefighter for nearly 20 years\nwithout any safety problem.  Baker Declaration ¶ 5 [3]; Baker 2d Declaration ¶ 6 [14].\nHe passed a fit test with his beard just as recently as all of the clean-shaven firefighters in\nthe Department.  Id.  And even in the highly unlikely event that some terrorist incident\noccurs during the pendency of his appeal, there is no reason to believe that he will be\nunable to respond the same as any other firefighter, using his much safer positive-\npressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), or, in the hypothetical situation\nwhere the “Go bag” filters must be used, with the negative pressure mask that he has\nshown he can wear safely.\n4.  Issuing an injunction pending appeal will serve the public interest.\nIn enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress declared it to be the\npublic policy of the United States that “governments should not substantially burden\nreligious exercise without compelling justification.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a)(3).  Because\nthe District of Columbia has failed to demonstrate any compelling justification for\nforcing plaintiffs Evans and Baker to choose between keeping their jobs and practicing\ntheir faiths, the public interest lies in allowing them to do both.\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 32      Filed 04/11/2006     Page 7 of 7\nConclusion\nFor the reasons given above and in plaintiffs’ earlier papers, which are\nincorporated herein by reference, the Court should grant plaintiffs Evans and Baker an\ninjunction pending appeal.\nA proposed order is filed herewith.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/\n_____________________________________________________________________\nArthur B.

All\nthe pending issues in this case need to be resolved as soon as\npossible.  The parties are directed to meet and confer on what\nadditional proceedings, if any, are needed before a final\ndetermination on the merits can be made, and, by April 28, 2006,\nto present a proposed schedule for such proceedings, including\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 33      Filed 04/18/2006     Page 2 of 3\ndates for briefing and any evidentiary hearing that may be\nrequired.  In the meantime, it is\nORDERED that the motion of plaintiffs Rahsumaa and\nConerly for an order directing the Fire Department to give them\nproper face tests [30] is denied.  The gist of this motion seems\nto be that plaintiffs failed the test because they were not given\nsufficient notice, but, since the test is of emergency equipment,\nsurprise or random testing seems quite reasonable.  It is\nFURTHER ORDERED that the motion of plaintiffs Evans and\nBaker for an injunction pending their cross-appeal that would\nallow them to re-grow their beards while continuing to serve in\nfield operations [32] is denied.  One of the premises of the\nrelief originally granted was that fully grown beards would be\nstable enough to produce repeatable test results; experimentation\nwith growing beards would be a significant departure from that\npremise.  And it is\nFURTHER ORDERED that plaintiffs' motion for\nclarification [31] is granted.  The March 20 order is clarified\nas follows: Periodic re-testing after a face-fit test failure\nwill not be permitted during the pendency of the cross-appeals. \nThe Department's hostility towards plaintiffs' facial hair is now\nquite evident, and it appears that, at least during the pendency\nof the appeals, face-fit testing will be an adversary process.  I\nwill neither sit as face-fit test monitor nor appoint a special\n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 33      Filed 04/18/2006     Page 3 of 3\nmaster for that purpose.

Wilson Building\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20004\nDefendant.\n_____________________________________\nAMENDED COMPLAINT\n(for injunctive relief and damages; violation of religious liberty)\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 2 of 14\n1.  This is an action to compel the District of Columbia Department of Fire and\nEmergency Medical Services (“Department” or “Fire Department”) and its officials to abide\nby their obligation to respect and accommodate the religious practices of its employees.  The\nDepartment prohibits its employees from wearing beards.  The plaintiffs are six employees\nwho hold sincere religious convictions prohibiting them from shaving their beards.  Plaintiffs\n(and many others) have worked at the Department for many years without shaving, and have\nexperienced no safety problems.  Modern safety equipment makes it unnecessary to be clean-\nshaven in order to be safe.  The Department therefore cannot prove that its no-beard rule is\nessential to safety.  In the absence of such proof the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\nprohibits the Department from overriding plaintiffs’ religious convictions.\n2.  In August 2005, in an essentially identical case styled Potter v. District of\nColumbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR), this Court entered a preliminary injunction protecting three\nFire Department employees from being discharged because they wear beards for religious\nreasons, and ordering the Department to allow them to take “fit tests” to show that they could\nsafely wear negative-pressure respirators despite their beards.  Disdaining this Court’s action,\nthe Fire Chief announced that he would proceed to discipline and discharge all other\nmembers of the Department who wear beards, no matter how sincere their religious reasons\nfor doing so.  Nor would he permit them to take fit tests before being discharged.  Injunctive\nrelief is necessary to protect the long-standing status quo and to prevent imminent and\nirreparable injury to plaintiffs’ religious rights.\nJurisdiction\n3.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n1343 because plaintiffs assert claims under federal law.  Plaintiffs’ cause of action is\n2\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 3 of 14\nestablished by 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4.  Venue lies in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\nParties\n5.  Plaintiff Steven B. Chasin is employed as a paramedic by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for more than seventeen years.  He has worn a short beard for more than\nnineteen years, as a sincere observance of his Jewish faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he\nwill be discharged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n6.  Plaintiff Kevin Conerly is employed as a firefighter by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for more than eighteen years.  He has worn a beard for approximately twenty-\nseven years, as a sincere observance of his Nazerite faith, which includes a vow not to shave.\nHe wore a beard during his service in the United States Army, 1980-1983, prior to joining the\nDepartment.  Absent relief from this Court, he will be discharged from the Department if he\ndoes not shave his beard.\n7.  Plaintiff Dwight Evans is employed as a paramedic by the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a member of the\nDepartment for thirty-two years; there is no paramedic senior to him in the Department.  He\nhas worn a beard for thirty-five years, including during his service in the United States Army\nprior to joining the Department.  Plaintiff Evans was a Baptist for most of his life, but\nbecame a Muslim in December 2004 and wears his neatly trimmed beard as one part of his\nsincere observance of his new religious faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he will be\ndischarged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n3\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 4 of 14\n8.  Plaintiff Shango Kwame Rashumaa was employed as a paramedic by the District\nof Columbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He was a member of the\nDepartment from 1999 to 2002, when he left to undertake a journey of personal and spiritual\ngrowth, traveling in Africa and the Caribbean and studying his spiritual and cultural heritage.\nAs part of his spiritual rebirth, he legally changed his name to what it is today.  As spiritual\nobservances, he follows a vegan diet, wears his hair in locks, covers his head, and does not\nshave his face.  He rejoined the Department in April 2004; he has not shaved, as a matter of\nsincere spiritual observance, since before that time.\n9.  Plaintiff Jasper W. Sterling is employed as a paramedic by the District of\nColumbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services. He has been a member of\nthe Department for sixteen years.  He has worn a beard for approximately twenty-six years,\nincluding during his five years of service in the United States Air Force.  He wears his beard\nas a sincere observance of his Muslim faith.  Absent relief from this Court, he will be\ndischarged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n10.  Plaintiff Eleon A. Baker is a sergeant with the District of Columbia Department\nof Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  He has been a D.C. firefighter for more than\ntwenty-two years, since June 1985.   He has worn a short beard, following the tenets of his\nNazerite faith, for about twenty-one years.  Absent relief from this Court, he will be\ndischarged from the Department if he does not shave his beard.\n11.  Defendant District of Columbia is a municipal corporation of which the District\nof Columbia Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services is an agency.\n4\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 5 of 14\nFacts\n12.  For at least thirty years prior to 2005, the Department officially permitted its\nemployees to wear 1/4-inch beards if they suffered from a medical condition known as\npseudofolliculitis barbae, also known as “PFB” or “razor bumps.”  Informally, the\nDepartment allowed all employees to wear such beards for at least twenty years prior to\n2005.  During that time, hundreds of Department members wore beards, and took and passed\nofficial fit tests while wearing beards.  During all that time, there was not a single incident in\nwhich a member’s facial hair was responsible for a safety problem.\n13.  Subsequent to the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in\nKennedy v. District of Columbia, 654 A.2d 847 (1994), all Department members were\nofficially permitted to wear 1/4-inch beards.  As a practical matter, the Department did not\nenforce the 1/4-inch limitation on the length of beards, and many members wore beards\nlonger than 1/4 inch.  Many Department members passed official fit tests while wearing\nbeards longer than 1/4 inch.  No member’s facial hair has ever been responsible for a safety\nproblem.\n14.  While on a fireground, or in any other toxic atmosphere, firefighters protect\nthemselves from respiratory injury by wearing a “self-contained breathing apparatus”\n(SCBA) consisting of a face mask connected to an air tank.  The air tank provides a constant\nflow of pressurized clean air to the face mask, such that any imperfections in the fit between\na firefighter’s face and mask will result in a leakage of clean air to the outside atmosphere,\nrather than a leakage of toxic material into the face mask.\n15.  The presence of facial hair might or might not cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.  Other variables, such as a thin face, prominent cheekbones,\n5\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 6 of 14\na long jaw or nose, or facial scars, might or might not also cause an imperfect fit between a\nfirefighter’s face and face mask.\n16.  Because of the positive-pressure feature of the SCBA, an imperfect fit does not\ndirectly endanger a firefighter’s life or health or the safety of others.\n17.  A less perfect fit—whatever its cause—will result in a firefighter depleting his or\nher air supply somewhat faster than a more perfect fit.  Many other individual variables,\nincluding body weight, physical fitness, respiratory efficiency, and physiological reaction to\nstress, will also affect the speed with which a firefighter depletes his or her air supply.\n18.  There is no reason to believe that the presence or absence of facial hair will have\na greater effect on the speed with which a firefighter’s air supply is used than the firefighter’s\nbody weight, physical fitness, respiratory efficiency, or physiological reaction to stress.\nFirefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker do not deplete their air supply faster than their fellow\nfirefighters.\n19.  Firefighters with facial hair present no greater risk to themselves or others, when\nfighting fires or when operating in any hazardous atmosphere, than clean-shaven firefighters.\n20.  Firefighter plaintiffs Conerly and Baker have been working safely for more than\n40 combined years with their beards.\n21.  In the spring of 2001, then-D.C. Fire Chief Ronnie Few announced strict\nenforcement of the Department’s grooming policy, which prohibited (among other things)\nbeards longer than 1/4 inch, hair longer than the top of the shirt collar (for men only), and\nhead coverings (such as yarmulkes and kufis) that were not part of the official uniform.  Six\nfirefighters who, as a matter of religious observance, wore beards, long hair, and/or head\ncoverings, filed a civil action in this Court to protect their rights under the Religious Freedom\n6\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 7 of 14\nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., and the First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.  That action was styled  Potter v. District of Columbia, No. 01-cv-1189 (JR).\n22.  On June 22, 2001, this Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the\nDepartment from taking any action against the plaintiffs in the Potter case because of their\nbeards, long hair or head coverings.  With regard to beards, this Court’s order rested on its\nunderstanding that the positive-pressure feature of the breathing apparatus provided\nprotection for firefighters with facial hair.\n23.  For the next four years, the Department honored that injunction and, by order of\nthe Fire Chief (Special Order 48, 2001, dated June 26, 2001), exempted all other members of\nthe Department who “object[ed] on a religious basis to any portion of the grooming\nregulations” from complying with the portion of the grooming regulations to which they so\nobjected.\n24.  In addition to firefighters, the Department employs approximately 200\nemergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who respond to emergency medical\ncalls in the District of Columbia.  Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel are not\ntrained or equipped to work in hazardous atmospheres.  Until some months after the terrorist\nattacks of September 11, 2001, the Department’s EMS personnel were not provided with, or\ntrained to use, respiratory protection apparatus.\n25.  Sometime in late 2001 or early 2002, the Department’s EMS personnel were\nprovided with face masks and “Go-bags,” which contain a filter that, when fitted to the face\nmask, creates an air-purifying respirator (APR) that provides protection against certain\natmospheric hazards.\n26.  When these Go-bags were issued, each emergency medical technician and\n7\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 8 of 14\nparamedic was required to take a fit test to determine whether he or she could obtain a good\nseal.  Plaintiffs Chasin, Evans, Rashumaa and Sterling, who are or were paramedics, each\npassed the fit test.  Each had a beard at the time.  Thirty to forty of the approximately 200\nemergency medical service personnel also had beards at that time, and each passed the fit\ntest.  Some clean-shaven personnel had difficulty passing the test, but after appropriate\nadjustments to their masks, everyone passed.\n27.  Subsequently, the Department’s firefighters were also provided with Go-bags.\n28.  A face mask fitted with a Go-bag filter operates as negative-pressure air-\npurifying respirator.  Because outside air is pulled through the filter by the user’s intake of\nbreath, outside air could leak into the face mask in the event of a poor fit.\n29.  For this and other reasons, the respirator formed by a face mask and Go-bag filter\nis not approved for use in a toxic atmosphere.  Department personnel are not permitted to\nwork in toxic atmospheres using their face masks and Go-bag filters.\n30.  When the Go-bags were distributed, Department personnel were advised that\nthey were intended for use in civil disturbance situations, for protection against non-lethal\nhazards such as tear gas, pepper spray, and the like.\n31. Department personnel are not required to, and do not, carry their face masks and\nGo-bags with them when they are off duty.  They are kept at the station house with members’\nother equipment.\n32.  On May 25, 2005, then-Fire Chief Thompson issued Special Order 20, Series\n2005.  That order requires all members to be clean-shaven in the area where the sealing\nsurface of their face masks meet their faces.  Because the sealing surface of a face mask\nmeets the face in the same area where a beard grows, the effect of Special Order 20 is that no\n8\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 9 of 14\nmember may wear a beard.  Special Order 20 provides that disobedience will result in\ndischarge.\n33.  At the time Special Order 20 was issued, then-Chief Thompson also issued a\n“Notice to Persons Seeking Exemption to Special Order 20, 2005 for Religious Reasons.”\nThat notice stated:\nSpecial Order 20, 2005 does not provide for an exemption for religion or\nany other reason.  However, because of court proceedings related to this\nissue, the Department will honor requests for a religious exemption until\nthe court rules on this matter. These requests will no longer be honored\nwhen and if the court rules that federal law does not require religious\nbased exemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.\n34.  Pursuant to that memorandum, the Department continued to allow members who\nwere not plaintiffs in the Potter case to wear beards for religious reasons in June, July and\npart of August 2005.\n35.  This court has never ruled that that federal law does not require religiously-based\nexemptions to Special Order 20, 2005.  To the contrary, on August 11, 2005, this Court\nentered an additional preliminary injunction in the Potter case ordering the Department to\naccommodate the religious beliefs of the Potter plaintiffs by allowing them (in the first\ninstance) to take fit tests, even though Special Order 20 provides that members with facial\nhair may not take fit tests.\n36.  Reneging on his May 2005 Notice, on August 24, 2005, then-Chief Thompson\nissued a new “Notice to Persons Seeking Exemption from Special Order 20 for Religious\nReasons,” stating that “[t]he Department is no longer honoring requests for a religious\nexemption,” and that “failure to comply with Special Order 20 shall result in disciplinary\naction as set forth in the order” regardless of the religious basis for a member’s wearing\nfacial hair.\n9\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 10 of 14\n37.  Despite this Court’s August 2005 order requiring fit tests for the Potter plaintiffs,\nthe Fire Chief did not permit other members with religious reasons for wearing beards to take\nfit tests before being discharged.\n38.  Even in the event that a Plaintiff could not pass a fit test—whether because of\nfacial hair or any other reason—alternative equipment is readily available that will provide\nhim with adequate respiratory protection in situations where the Go-bag filter would be used.\n39.  The Department owns a number of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\nmanufactured by the same company that makes both the face masks used by all firefighters in\nconnection with their SCBAs and the filters contained in the Go-bags.  These PAPRs are\ncompatible (or “interoperable”) with the Department’s other respiratory protection\nequipment.\n40.  A PAPR is similar to the APR formed by a face mask and Go-bag filter, except\nthat in a PAPR a battery-operated fan pushes air through the filter.  A PAPR therefore creates\na positive-pressure atmosphere inside the face mask, so that any leakage will be outward.  A\nPAPR also eliminates the need for the user to operate the filter through his or her own\nrespiratory effort.  A PAPR therefore provides both better protection, and a longer work-\nspan, than an APR formed by a face mask and Go-bag filter.\n41.  In the event that a Plaintiff could not pass a fit test because of his religious\nobservance, use of a PAPR would provide him with at least as good a level of respiratory\nprotection as other Department members would obtain using their Go-bag filter mask , and\nwould enable him to work for longer than he could work using his Go-bag equipment.\n42.  The cost to the Department of issuing PAPRs to plaintiffs would be a minuscule\nfraction of the Department’s operating budget, which exceeds $150 million annually.\n10\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 11 of 14\n43.  The Department cannot satisfy its burden of demonstrating, that these or other\naccommodations will not satisfy its interest in safety while allowing Plaintiffs to exercise\ntheir religious beliefs.\n44.  Plaintiffs can obtain adequate respiratory protection in any situation in which\nthey would be expected to work by wearing their self-contained breathing apparatus or by\nusing a PAPR.  There is no situation in which their Go-bag filters would provide better\nprotection.\n45.  Special Order 20 further provides that on the first day a member reports for duty\nwith facial hair he will be removed from field operations and ordered to shave, that on the\nsecond day a member reports for duty with facial hair he will be suspended for 12 duty hours,\nthat on the third day a member reports for duty with facial hair he will be suspended for 24\nduty hours, and that on the fourth day a member reports for duty with facial hair his\ntermination will be proposed.\n46.  Plaintiffs Chasin, Evans, Conerly, Baker and Sterling have been on\nadministrative duty since failing fit tests in 2005 and 2006.  While on administrative duty\nstatus, Plaintiffs suffer a major loss of pay because of the manner in which Department\npersonnel are compensated.  Plaintiffs also suffer the loss of benefits and other terms and\nconditions of employment.\n47.  In the absence of injunctive relief by this Court, Plaintiffs Chasin, Evans,\nConerly, Baker and Sterling will be discharged from the Department.\n48.  Plaintiffs have already suffered, and will continue to suffer, mental and emotional\ndistress because of defendant’s unlawful conduct.\n11\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 12 of 14\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (RFRA)\n49.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides, in pertinent part, that:\n(a) Government shall not substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability, except as provided in subsection (b) of this\nsection.\n(b)  Government  may  substantially  burden  a  person’s\nexercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the\nburden  to  the  person-  (1)  is  in  furtherance  of  a  compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\n50.  The District of Columbia and its Department of Fire and Emergency Medical\nServices are subject to the commands of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n51.  The Department’s prohibition of beards substantially burdens plaintiffs’ exercise\nof their religious beliefs by forcing them to choose between their jobs and their faith.\n52.  The Department’s prohibition of beards is not the least restrictive means of\nsatisfying any compelling interest of the defendant.\n53.  A less restrictive means of satisfying the Department’s interest in safety is to\nallow plaintiffs to fit tests.  If a plaintiff can pass the fit test, he is as safe as any other\nmember of the Department.\n54.  Even if a plaintiff does not pass a fit test, a less restrictive means of satisfying the\nDepartment’s interest in safety is for plaintiffs to use SCBAs or PAPRs (as appropriate to\neach plaintiff’s job and as appropriate to the conditions of a particular situation).  Using an\nSCBA or a PAPR, a plaintiff is as safe as any other member of the Department.\n55.  The Department cannot satisfy its burden of showing that these or other feasible\naccommodations will not adequately satisfy its interest in safety.\n12\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 13 of 14\n56.  The Department’s refusal to accommodate plaintiffs’ religious observances by\nusing less restrictive means to satisfy the Department’s interest in safety violates plaintiffs’\nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nSecond Claim for Relief (First Amendment)\n57.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits governmental\nentities from interfering with the rights of its citizens to freely exercise their religious\nbeliefs.\n58.  Enforcement of the grooming policy and other policies that discriminate\nagainst Plaintiffs because of their religious practices and beliefs constitutes a deprivation\nof Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.\n59.  Plaintiffs’ beliefs regarding the significance of their hair beards are sincere\nand religious in nature, and the Defendants' policies are an unreasonable restraint on\nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to exercise their religion freely.\n60.  The Department’s refusal to accommodate Plaintiffs’ religious practices has\nharmed and will harm Plaintiffs by violating their First Amendment rights.\n61.  The Department’s policies are subject to strict scrutiny review under the First\nAmendment because they are not neutral laws of general applicability.  Heightened\nscrutiny is alternatively appropriate because the policies allow for a system of\nindividualized exceptions.\nRequest for Relief\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs ask that this Court:\n(A)  Declare, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that Defendant’s prohibition of facial hair\nviolates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act;\n13\n\nCase 1:05-cv-01792-JR     Document 54      Filed 08/22/2007     Page 14 of 14\n(B)  Enter preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the Defendant, and\nits officers and agents, from discharging any Plaintiff, or imposing any sanction or other\nadverse consequence against any Plaintiff, on account of that Plaintiff’s facial hair;\n(C)  Order, with respect to any time period for which Plaintiffs are assigned to\nadministrative duties on account of their facial hair, that they perform those duties on\ntheir regular schedules and be paid accordingly;\n(D)  Make Plaintiffs whole, with respect to pay, benefits, seniority, and all other\nterms and conditions of employment, for all losses resulting from their being removed\nfrom active duty because of their religious observances;\n(E)  Award Plaintiffs compensatory damages in an amount commensurate with the\nproof adduced at trial;\n(F)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable costs and attorney fees; and\n(G)  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as the Court deems just and\nproper.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/  Arthur B.
