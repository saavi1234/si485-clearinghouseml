Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Court has endorsed and docketed this Stipulation and Order, Defendants shall pay to Plaintiffs the sum of nine thousand, five hundred dollars ($9,500) for attorneys' fees and litigation costs. This payment shall constitute full and final satisfaction of any claims by Plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and litigation costs in this matter, and is inclusive of any interest. Payment shall be made by electronic funds transfers, and counsel for Plaintiffs will provide the necessary information to counsel for the Defendants to effectuate the transfers. Defendants shall make their best effort to make payment to Plaintiffs within 90 days following the dismissal of this Action. As further set forth by this Order. This action is accordingly dismissed with prejudice and without costs or fees other than as provided in paragraph 1 of this Stipulation and Order, provided that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over any issues that might arise relating to the enforcement of this Stipulation and Order. Because this stipulation does not require the Court to oversee the enforcement of any prospective relief or find that Plaintiff \"substantially prevailed\" under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E), the Court construes this stipulation simply as a binding agreement plus a dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), which requires no Court endorsement. The Clerk of Court is directed to close this case. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Arun Subramanian on 4/15/2024) (tg) Transmission to Finance Unit (Cashiers) for processing. (Entered: 04/15/2024)"

In this lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union sought public release of opinions from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) regarding Section 702 surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1881a, permits the AG and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. Section 702 requires that the AG, through the DOJ, and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).</p>\r\n<p>The ACLU alleged that on December 22, 2022, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), it requested all FISC opinions since 2021 about &ldquo;novel or significant legal issues&rdquo; and asked to expedite the process. When it did not receive the opinions, it filed this lawsuit, alleging a FOIA violation. The ACLU also noted that Section 702 of FISA was set to expire in December 2023 unless Congress reauthorized it. As a result, the ACLU believed timely disclosure of these opinions was &ldquo;vitally necessary to an informed debate about whether these surveillance powers should be reauthorized or reformed.&rdquo; The ACLU sought an injunction requiring Defendants to process the requests immediately and preventing Defendants from assessing fees for the processing of the requests, as well as attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Lewis J. Liman and designated to Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo. The case was then reassigned to Judge Arun Subramanian on August 10, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>After discussions between the parties and additional searches by the defendants, the parties agreed to a settlement to dispose the matter. Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiffs $9,500 for attorneys&rsquo; fees and litigation costs. On April 15th, 2024, the Court dismissed the case, and it is now closed.</p>",

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n   \nNATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,    \nOFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF     Case No. 23-cv-907 \nNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,    \nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,        \nand DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) seeks the timely \nrelease of agency records concerning Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—a \nsweeping law that authorizes the warrantless surveillance of international communications. The \ngovernment uses Section 702 to amass vast amounts of internet and telephone communications \neach year, including many communications involving Americans. Recent opinions issued by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) address novel or significant issues raised by the \nagencies’ applications to conduct Section 702 surveillance, and directly implicate Americans’ \nprivacy rights. Immediate disclosure of these records is critical to informing public debate as \nCongress weighs whether to reauthorize the law when it expires this year.  \n2.  Plaintiffs,  two  non-profit,  non-partisan  civil  liberties  advocacy  organizations, \nsubmitted a FOIA request (the “Request”) to the National Security Agency, Office of the Director \n \n \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 2 of 11\nof National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, and Department of Justice on December 22, \n2022, seeking the release of these FISC opinions. To date, none of these Defendant agencies has \nreleased any responsive records, notwithstanding the FOIA’s requirement that agencies respond \nto requests within twenty working days. \n3.  Section 702 is set to expire in December 2023. In the coming months, Congress \nwill consider whether to reauthorize these surveillance powers and will newly examine the breadth \nand intrusiveness of the digital searches the government conducts under this authority. \n4.  In 2021, the FISC took the unusual step of extending its review of the government's \nannual Section 702 application, in order to consider novel or significant issues raised by the \nproposed surveillance. But the government has not released the court opinions that resulted from \nthat review, even though they bear directly on the public’s understanding of the surveillance \npowers the government seeks to wield under Section 702. \n5.  Timely disclosure of these FISC opinions is vitally necessary to an informed debate \nabout whether these surveillance powers should be reauthorized or reformed.  \n6.  Plaintiffs now ask the Court for an injunction requiring Defendants to process the \nRequest immediately. Plaintiffs also seek an order enjoining Defendants from assessing fees for \nthe processing of the Request. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction \nover the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The Court also has jurisdiction over this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06. \n8.  Venue lies in this district under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n  2\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 3 of 11\nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union is a nationwide, non-profit, nonpartisan \n26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4) organization, incorporated in the District of Columbia and with its principal \nplace of business in New York City. The American Civil Liberties Union’s mission is to maintain \nand advance civil rights and civil liberties and to ensure that the U.S. government acts in \ncompliance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. The American Civil Liberties \nUnion is also committed to principles of transparency and accountability in government, and seeks \nto ensure that the American public is informed about the conduct of its government in matters that \naffect  civil  liberties  and  human  rights.  Obtaining  information  about  governmental  activity, \nanalyzing that information, and widely publishing and disseminating it to the press and the public \nis a critical and substantial component of the American Civil Liberties Union’s work and one of \nits primary activities.  \n10.  Plaintiff  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  Foundation  is  a  separate  501(c)(3) \norganization that educates the public about civil liberties and employs lawyers who provide legal \nrepresentation free of charge in cases involving civil liberties. It is incorporated in New York State \nand its principal place of business is in New York City.   \n11.  Plaintiffs together are referred to as the “ACLU.”   \n12.  Defendant National Security Agency (“NSA”) is an intelligence agency established \nwithin the executive branch of the U.S. government and administered through the Department of \nDefense. The NSA is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n13.  Defendant Office of the Director of National Intelligence (“ODNI”) is a department \nof the executive branch of the U.S. government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1). \n  3\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 4 of 11\n14.  Defendant  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (“CIA”)  is  an  intelligence  agency \nestablished within the executive branch of the U.S. government and is an agency within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n15.  Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is a department of the executive branch \nof the U.S. government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). The National \nSecurity Division (“NSD”), from which the ACLU has requested records, is a component of the \nDOJ. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n16.  Section  702  authorizes  the  widespread  collection  of  Americans’  international \ncommunications without a warrant. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. While this surveillance is ostensibly \n“targeted” at foreigners located overseas, the government uses this authority to acquire the internet \ncommunications and phone calls of Americans who are in contact with hundreds of thousands of \nforeign targets.  \n17.  The statute is extraordinarily permissive. It allows agency analysts to collect the \ncommunications of any non-U.S. person abroad where a “significant purpose” is to acquire \n“foreign intelligence,” a broad and elastic category. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a, 1801. This warrantless \nsurveillance is permitted even if there is an American on one end of the communications. \nWhenever the government’s targets—who may be journalists, academic researchers, scientists, or \nbusinesspeople abroad—communicate with a person in the United States, those communications \nare subject to interception and retention under Section 702. \n18.  In  practice,  the  government  uses  this  authority  to  seize  and  search  the \ncommunications of Americans and others on an immense scale. Government disclosures indicate \n  4\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 5 of 11\nthat, as of 2011, the NSA collected more than 250 million internet communications under Section \n702 annually. As the number of Section 702 targets has grown since then—to include more than \n232,000 individuals, groups, and organizations—the NSA now likely collects over a billion \ncommunications each year.  \n19.  Since  its  enactment,  Section  702  has  been  the  subject  of  widespread  public \ncontroversy,  given  its  impact  on  the  privacy,  free  expression,  and  associational  rights  of \nAmericans. \n20.  Section 702 permits the government to obtain the communications of Americans \nwithout a finding of probable cause or any suspicion of wrongdoing at all. Rather than applying \nfor  individualized  warrants,  the  government  submits  annual  certifications  to  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) describing the general procedures and guidelines it \nintends to follow in conducting the surveillance. The government does not identify its individual \ntargets or the various places and facilities at which its surveillance will be directed. 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 188la(a), 188la(g)(4).  \n21.  The statute’s safeguards are limited to the requirement that each agency adopt \nprocedures that are reasonably designed to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit \nthe dissemination of U.S. persons’ information. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(j)(2)(C) (referencing 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(l), 1821(4)(A)). These procedures, however, grant the government wide \nlatitude to seize, search, analyze, and use the communications of Americans.  \n22.  The FISC’s role in reviewing the surveillance is narrowly circumscribed. It is \nlimited to approving the general procedures and the annual certifications; the FISC does not \napprove the government’s interception of individual Americans’ communications. \n  5\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 6 of 11\n23.  The government routinely relies on warrantless surveillance under Section 702 to \ninvestigate individual Americans. Communications collected under Section 702 are amassed in \ngovernment databases, where intelligence analysts and criminal investigators can conduct queries \nseeking the private messages, emails, and internet chats of Americans.  \n24.  The scale of these intrusions is vast: FBI agents alone conduct millions of U.S. \nperson queries—or “backdoor searches”—each year. Indeed, agents around the country can \ngenerally search for and read through U.S. persons’ private communications without needing to \nobtain even a supervisor’s approval.  \n25.  Congress last authorized Section 702 in 2018, following an extensive public and \nlegislative debate. Because of the privacy and civil liberties concerns raised by this sweeping \nsurveillance, Congress imposed a new sunset date in 2023.   \n26.  Despite the breadth and intrusiveness of this surveillance regime, the public lacks \ncritical information about how Section 702 surveillance has expanded and evolved in recent \nyears—information that is essential for a meaningful debate about whether the statute should be \nreauthorized. \n27.  Behind closed doors, the FISC has been examining novel or significant issues \nrelated to the government’s Section 702 applications since at least late 2020. Although the FISC \ntypically issues at least one order approving the government’s Section 702 certification each year, \nthe court declined to issue any Section 702 orders in 2021. Instead, the FISC extended its review \nof the government’s proposed surveillance. It also appointed outside amici to assist in that review, \nas Congress has mandated when the government’s surveillance applications present “novel or \nsignificant” questions of law. 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2). \n  6\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 7 of 11\n28.  The opinions issued by the FISC as a result of this review have not been released \nto the public—notwithstanding a statutory requirement that the government publicly release “to \nthe greatest extent practicable” FISC opinions addressing novel or significant issues. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1872. \n29.  Without access to these opinions, the public has no insight into the kinds of novel \nsurveillance Defendants are seeking to conduct under Section 702, the impact that surveillance \nmay have on the rights and civil liberties of Americans if Section 702 is reauthorized, and the \nreforms that may be required to safeguard Americans’ privacy. This information is vital for the \npublic and legislative debate that is already getting underway.  \nThe FOIA Request \n30.  On December 22, 2022, the ACLU submitted the Request to Defendants, seeking \n“all FISC or FISCR [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review] opinions or orders dated \non or after January 1, 2021, that address novel or significant issues, including but not limited to \nnovel or significant issues concerning Section 702 surveillance.” \n31.  Plaintiffs sought expedited processing of the Request on the ground that there is a \n“compelling need” for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an \norganization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about \nactual or alleged federal government activity. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E).  \n32.  Plaintiffs sought a waiver of search, review, and reproduction fees on the ground \nthat disclosure of the requested records is “in the public interest because it is likely to contribute \nsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not \nprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \n  7\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 8 of 11\n33.  Plaintiffs also sought a waiver of search and review fees on the grounds that the \nACLU qualifies as a “representative of the news media” and that the records are not sought for \ncommercial use. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). \nDefendants’ Responses to the Request \n34.  Despite the urgent public interest regarding government surveillance activities, \nDefendants have not released any records in response to the Request.  \n35.  Under FOIA, Defendants have twenty working days to respond to a request. 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  \n36.  If there are “unusual circumstances,” an agency may extend the time limit by no \nmore than ten working days. Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i). To invoke that extension, the agency must \nprovide “written notice . . . setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date \non which a determination is expected to be dispatched.” Id.  \n37.  An agency can extend its processing time beyond the additional ten days only if it \nprovides written notice and “an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be \nprocessed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time \nframe for processing the request or a modified request.” Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). \n38.  More than twenty working days have passed since Plaintiffs filed the Request and \nno Defendant has provided the written notice required for an extension. Thus, the statutory time \nperiod has elapsed. \nNational Security Agency \n39.  By letter dated December 29, 2022, the NSA acknowledged receipt of the Request \nand assigned it tracking number 11544. \n  8\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 9 of 11\n40.  The letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and deferred decision \non Plaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver. \n41.  By letter dated January 25, 2023, the NSA stated that the Request “has been placed \nin the first-in, first-out processing backlog queue.” \n42.  To date, the NSA has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the NSA has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence \n43.  By letter dated December 29, 2022, the ODNI acknowledged receipt of the Request \nand assigned it tracking number DF-2023-00066. \n44.  The ODNI letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and granted \nPlaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver. \n45.  To date, the ODNI has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis \nfor withholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the ODNI has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nCentral Intelligence Agency \n46.  By letter dated January 4, 2023, the CIA acknowledged receipt of the Request and \nassigned it tracking number F-2023-00495. \n47.  The CIA letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and granted \nPlaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver.  \n48.  To date, the CIA has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the CIA has failed \nto comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \n  9\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 10 of 11\nDepartment of Justice \n49.  By email dated January 17, 2023, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of the request and \nassigned it tracking number 23-116.  \n50.  The DOJ email denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and did not \ncomment on Plaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver.  \n51.  To date, the DOJ has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the DOJ has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n52.  The  failure  of  Defendants  to  make  a  reasonable  effort  to  search  for  records \nresponsive to the Request violates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3), and Defendants’ corresponding \nregulations. \n53.  The failure of Defendants to promptly make available the records sought by the \nRequest violates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(3)(A), (a)(6)(A), and Defendants’ corresponding \nregulations. \n54.  The failure of Defendants to process Plaintiffs’ request expeditiously and as soon \nas  practicable  violates  the  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a)(6)(E),  and  Defendants’  corresponding \nregulations. \n55.  The failure of Defendants to grant Plaintiffs’ request for a waiver of search, review, \nand  duplication  fees  violates  the  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §§  552(a)(4),  (a)(6),  and  Defendants’ \ncorresponding regulations. \n56.  The failure of Defendants’ to grant Plaintiffs’ request for a limitation of fees \nviolates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4), (a)(6), and Defendants’ corresponding regulations. \n  10\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 11 of 11\nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n   \nNATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,    \nOFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF     Case No. 23-cv-907 \nNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,    \nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,        \nand DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) seeks the timely \nrelease of agency records concerning Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—a \nsweeping law that authorizes the warrantless surveillance of international communications. The \ngovernment uses Section 702 to amass vast amounts of internet and telephone communications \neach year, including many communications involving Americans. Recent opinions issued by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) address novel or significant issues raised by the \nagencies’ applications to conduct Section 702 surveillance, and directly implicate Americans’ \nprivacy rights. Immediate disclosure of these records is critical to informing public debate as \nCongress weighs whether to reauthorize the law when it expires this year.  \n2.  Plaintiffs,  two  non-profit,  non-partisan  civil  liberties  advocacy  organizations, \nsubmitted a FOIA request (the “Request”) to the National Security Agency, Office of the Director \n \n \n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 2 of 11\nof National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, and Department of Justice on December 22, \n2022, seeking the release of these FISC opinions. To date, none of these Defendant agencies has \nreleased any responsive records, notwithstanding the FOIA’s requirement that agencies respond \nto requests within twenty working days. \n3.  Section 702 is set to expire in December 2023. In the coming months, Congress \nwill consider whether to reauthorize these surveillance powers and will newly examine the breadth \nand intrusiveness of the digital searches the government conducts under this authority. \n4.  In 2021, the FISC took the unusual step of extending its review of the government's \nannual Section 702 application, in order to consider novel or significant issues raised by the \nproposed surveillance. But the government has not released the court opinions that resulted from \nthat review, even though they bear directly on the public’s understanding of the surveillance \npowers the government seeks to wield under Section 702. \n5.  Timely disclosure of these FISC opinions is vitally necessary to an informed debate \nabout whether these surveillance powers should be reauthorized or reformed.  \n6.  Plaintiffs now ask the Court for an injunction requiring Defendants to process the \nRequest immediately. Plaintiffs also seek an order enjoining Defendants from assessing fees for \nthe processing of the Request. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction \nover the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The Court also has jurisdiction over this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06. \n8.  Venue lies in this district under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n  2\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 3 of 11\nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union is a nationwide, non-profit, nonpartisan \n26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4) organization, incorporated in the District of Columbia and with its principal \nplace of business in New York City. The American Civil Liberties Union’s mission is to maintain \nand advance civil rights and civil liberties and to ensure that the U.S. government acts in \ncompliance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. The American Civil Liberties \nUnion is also committed to principles of transparency and accountability in government, and seeks \nto ensure that the American public is informed about the conduct of its government in matters that \naffect  civil  liberties  and  human  rights.  Obtaining  information  about  governmental  activity, \nanalyzing that information, and widely publishing and disseminating it to the press and the public \nis a critical and substantial component of the American Civil Liberties Union’s work and one of \nits primary activities.  \n10.  Plaintiff  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  Foundation  is  a  separate  501(c)(3) \norganization that educates the public about civil liberties and employs lawyers who provide legal \nrepresentation free of charge in cases involving civil liberties. It is incorporated in New York State \nand its principal place of business is in New York City.   \n11.  Plaintiffs together are referred to as the “ACLU.”   \n12.  Defendant National Security Agency (“NSA”) is an intelligence agency established \nwithin the executive branch of the U.S. government and administered through the Department of \nDefense. The NSA is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n13.  Defendant Office of the Director of National Intelligence (“ODNI”) is a department \nof the executive branch of the U.S. government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1). \n  3\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 4 of 11\n14.  Defendant  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (“CIA”)  is  an  intelligence  agency \nestablished within the executive branch of the U.S. government and is an agency within the \nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n15.  Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is a department of the executive branch \nof the U.S. government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). The National \nSecurity Division (“NSD”), from which the ACLU has requested records, is a component of the \nDOJ. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n16.  Section  702  authorizes  the  widespread  collection  of  Americans’  international \ncommunications without a warrant. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. While this surveillance is ostensibly \n“targeted” at foreigners located overseas, the government uses this authority to acquire the internet \ncommunications and phone calls of Americans who are in contact with hundreds of thousands of \nforeign targets.  \n17.  The statute is extraordinarily permissive. It allows agency analysts to collect the \ncommunications of any non-U.S. person abroad where a “significant purpose” is to acquire \n“foreign intelligence,” a broad and elastic category. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a, 1801. This warrantless \nsurveillance is permitted even if there is an American on one end of the communications. \nWhenever the government’s targets—who may be journalists, academic researchers, scientists, or \nbusinesspeople abroad—communicate with a person in the United States, those communications \nare subject to interception and retention under Section 702. \n18.  In  practice,  the  government  uses  this  authority  to  seize  and  search  the \ncommunications of Americans and others on an immense scale. Government disclosures indicate \n  4\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 5 of 11\nthat, as of 2011, the NSA collected more than 250 million internet communications under Section \n702 annually. As the number of Section 702 targets has grown since then—to include more than \n232,000 individuals, groups, and organizations—the NSA now likely collects over a billion \ncommunications each year.  \n19.  Since  its  enactment,  Section  702  has  been  the  subject  of  widespread  public \ncontroversy,  given  its  impact  on  the  privacy,  free  expression,  and  associational  rights  of \nAmericans. \n20.  Section 702 permits the government to obtain the communications of Americans \nwithout a finding of probable cause or any suspicion of wrongdoing at all. Rather than applying \nfor  individualized  warrants,  the  government  submits  annual  certifications  to  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) describing the general procedures and guidelines it \nintends to follow in conducting the surveillance. The government does not identify its individual \ntargets or the various places and facilities at which its surveillance will be directed. 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 188la(a), 188la(g)(4).  \n21.  The statute’s safeguards are limited to the requirement that each agency adopt \nprocedures that are reasonably designed to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit \nthe dissemination of U.S. persons’ information. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(j)(2)(C) (referencing 50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(l), 1821(4)(A)). These procedures, however, grant the government wide \nlatitude to seize, search, analyze, and use the communications of Americans.  \n22.  The FISC’s role in reviewing the surveillance is narrowly circumscribed. It is \nlimited to approving the general procedures and the annual certifications; the FISC does not \napprove the government’s interception of individual Americans’ communications. \n  5\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 6 of 11\n23.  The government routinely relies on warrantless surveillance under Section 702 to \ninvestigate individual Americans. Communications collected under Section 702 are amassed in \ngovernment databases, where intelligence analysts and criminal investigators can conduct queries \nseeking the private messages, emails, and internet chats of Americans.  \n24.  The scale of these intrusions is vast: FBI agents alone conduct millions of U.S. \nperson queries—or “backdoor searches”—each year. Indeed, agents around the country can \ngenerally search for and read through U.S. persons’ private communications without needing to \nobtain even a supervisor’s approval.  \n25.  Congress last authorized Section 702 in 2018, following an extensive public and \nlegislative debate. Because of the privacy and civil liberties concerns raised by this sweeping \nsurveillance, Congress imposed a new sunset date in 2023.   \n26.  Despite the breadth and intrusiveness of this surveillance regime, the public lacks \ncritical information about how Section 702 surveillance has expanded and evolved in recent \nyears—information that is essential for a meaningful debate about whether the statute should be \nreauthorized. \n27.  Behind closed doors, the FISC has been examining novel or significant issues \nrelated to the government’s Section 702 applications since at least late 2020. Although the FISC \ntypically issues at least one order approving the government’s Section 702 certification each year, \nthe court declined to issue any Section 702 orders in 2021. Instead, the FISC extended its review \nof the government’s proposed surveillance. It also appointed outside amici to assist in that review, \nas Congress has mandated when the government’s surveillance applications present “novel or \nsignificant” questions of law. 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2). \n  6\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 7 of 11\n28.  The opinions issued by the FISC as a result of this review have not been released \nto the public—notwithstanding a statutory requirement that the government publicly release “to \nthe greatest extent practicable” FISC opinions addressing novel or significant issues. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1872. \n29.  Without access to these opinions, the public has no insight into the kinds of novel \nsurveillance Defendants are seeking to conduct under Section 702, the impact that surveillance \nmay have on the rights and civil liberties of Americans if Section 702 is reauthorized, and the \nreforms that may be required to safeguard Americans’ privacy. This information is vital for the \npublic and legislative debate that is already getting underway.  \nThe FOIA Request \n30.  On December 22, 2022, the ACLU submitted the Request to Defendants, seeking \n“all FISC or FISCR [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review] opinions or orders dated \non or after January 1, 2021, that address novel or significant issues, including but not limited to \nnovel or significant issues concerning Section 702 surveillance.” \n31.  Plaintiffs sought expedited processing of the Request on the ground that there is a \n“compelling need” for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an \norganization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about \nactual or alleged federal government activity. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E).  \n32.  Plaintiffs sought a waiver of search, review, and reproduction fees on the ground \nthat disclosure of the requested records is “in the public interest because it is likely to contribute \nsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not \nprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \n  7\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 8 of 11\n33.  Plaintiffs also sought a waiver of search and review fees on the grounds that the \nACLU qualifies as a “representative of the news media” and that the records are not sought for \ncommercial use. Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). \nDefendants’ Responses to the Request \n34.  Despite the urgent public interest regarding government surveillance activities, \nDefendants have not released any records in response to the Request.  \n35.  Under FOIA, Defendants have twenty working days to respond to a request. 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  \n36.  If there are “unusual circumstances,” an agency may extend the time limit by no \nmore than ten working days. Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i). To invoke that extension, the agency must \nprovide “written notice . . . setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date \non which a determination is expected to be dispatched.” Id.  \n37.  An agency can extend its processing time beyond the additional ten days only if it \nprovides written notice and “an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be \nprocessed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time \nframe for processing the request or a modified request.” Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). \n38.  More than twenty working days have passed since Plaintiffs filed the Request and \nno Defendant has provided the written notice required for an extension. Thus, the statutory time \nperiod has elapsed. \nNational Security Agency \n39.  By letter dated December 29, 2022, the NSA acknowledged receipt of the Request \nand assigned it tracking number 11544. \n  8\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 9 of 11\n40.  The letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and deferred decision \non Plaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver. \n41.  By letter dated January 25, 2023, the NSA stated that the Request “has been placed \nin the first-in, first-out processing backlog queue.” \n42.  To date, the NSA has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the NSA has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence \n43.  By letter dated December 29, 2022, the ODNI acknowledged receipt of the Request \nand assigned it tracking number DF-2023-00066. \n44.  The ODNI letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and granted \nPlaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver. \n45.  To date, the ODNI has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis \nfor withholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the ODNI has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nCentral Intelligence Agency \n46.  By letter dated January 4, 2023, the CIA acknowledged receipt of the Request and \nassigned it tracking number F-2023-00495. \n47.  The CIA letter denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and granted \nPlaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver.  \n48.  To date, the CIA has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the CIA has failed \nto comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \n  9\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 10 of 11\nDepartment of Justice \n49.  By email dated January 17, 2023, the DOJ acknowledged receipt of the request and \nassigned it tracking number 23-116.  \n50.  The DOJ email denied Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing and did not \ncomment on Plaintiffs’ request for a fee waiver.  \n51.  To date, the DOJ has neither released responsive records nor explained its basis for \nwithholding them. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies because the DOJ has \nfailed to comply with the time limit for responding to the Request under the FOIA. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n52.  The  failure  of  Defendants  to  make  a  reasonable  effort  to  search  for  records \nresponsive to the Request violates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3), and Defendants’ corresponding \nregulations. \n53.  The failure of Defendants to promptly make available the records sought by the \nRequest violates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(3)(A), (a)(6)(A), and Defendants’ corresponding \nregulations. \n54.  The failure of Defendants to process Plaintiffs’ request expeditiously and as soon \nas  practicable  violates  the  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a)(6)(E),  and  Defendants’  corresponding \nregulations. \n55.  The failure of Defendants to grant Plaintiffs’ request for a waiver of search, review, \nand  duplication  fees  violates  the  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §§  552(a)(4),  (a)(6),  and  Defendants’ \ncorresponding regulations. \n56.  The failure of Defendants’ to grant Plaintiffs’ request for a limitation of fees \nviolates the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4), (a)(6), and Defendants’ corresponding regulations. \n  10\n\nCase 1:23-cv-00907   Document 1   Filed 02/03/23   Page 11 of 11\nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.
