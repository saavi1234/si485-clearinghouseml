    "summary": "<p>This entry summarizes an order that the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued in multiple cases related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, 2021, Judge Rudolph Contreras of the FISC issued an order addressing the FBI's use of information that had come from surveillance conducted pursuant to various FISA provisions: Section 702 (foreign targeting), Title I (electronic surveillance), Title III (physical searches), and Title V (business records or other tangible things). The court held that the FBI was searching un-minimized information without following the government's requirement that a search had to be reasonably expected to return foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime. In fact, the FBI's procedures only required that a search be used to find foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime \"to the extent reasonably feasible.\" The FBI had revised its procedures to require a written statement about why the search was reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime, but these statements were mostly being made from a pre-prepared list of options rather than a case-specific explanation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court noted that in the previous few years, it had addressed this issue multiple times. The court cited its conclusion from 2018 that the FBI's repeated failure to follow the correct standard for Section 702 searches meant that the searches were not being conducted pursuant to minimization procedures, as the Fourth Amendment requires. It also had found violations in 2019 and 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The court also addressed an issue involving its previous order that the FBI regularly report how many of its searches of Section 702 data were about evidence of a crime and not about foreign intelligence. The government had reported such a low rate of these searches that it \"strain[ed] credulity,\" and the court stated that it was likely due to under-reporting issues. This could cause violations of Section 702, which requires the FBI to sometimes get approval before accessing communications unrelated to foreign intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, the FISC ordered that (1) the FBI's search procedures must fully explain the requirements for querying un-minimized information, and be consistent between Titles I, III, and V and Section 702; (2) the FBI had to tell the court what it was doing to ensure compliance; (3) the FBI had to explain how it interpreted language in Section 702 about viewing foreign intelligence information and information about crimes; and (4) the FBI had to provide an assessment of whether its current systems and practices complied with Section 702.</p>\r\n<p>The FISC later addressed the FBI's compliance issues discussed here in the <a href=\"../../../../case/45192/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2021 FISA certification</a>.</p>",

Therefore, the court ordered the FBI to change its search procedures and assess its compliance with Section 702 of FISA.

Violations of the Substantive Querying Standard \nThe Government has represented that the substantive standard for FBI personnel to run \nqueries of un-minimized information is practically equivalent for collection under any of the \nabove-identified authorities.  See In re DNIIAG 702(h) Certification 2018-A, et al., Memorandum \nOpinion and Order at 70 (FISC Docket Nos. 7020)-18-01, et al. Oct. 18, 2018) (\"October 18, \n2018 Opinion\"), aff'd in part, In re DNI/AG 702(h) Certifications 2018-A, 2018-B, and 2018-C, \nand Predecessor Certifications (FIS CR July 12, 2019) (per curiam) (\"In re DNIIA G \nCertifications\").  The Government \nhas characterized [that] standard as a high one, having three elements: (1) a query \ncannot be overly broad, but rather must be designed to extract foreign-intelligence \ninformation or evidence of crime; (2) it must have an authorized purpose and not \nbe run for personal or improper reasons; and (3) there must be a reasonable basis \nto expect [it] will return foreign intelligence information or evidence ofc rime. \nId. at 67 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  But the querying standards \nexplicitly stated in the applicable FBI procedures do not include these three elements.  Rather, \nthe FBI minimization procedures applicable to information acquired under Titles I, III, and V \nsimply provide that, \"[t]o the extent reasonably feasible,\" authorized users with access to raw \ninformation must design queries to find and extract foreign intelligence information or evidence \n1 The cited version of Title V remains in effect for particular foreign intelligence \ninvestigations that began before March 15, 2020.  See Pub. L. 109-177, § 102, as amended by \nPub. L.111-118, § 1004(a), Pub. L. 111-141, § l(a), Pub. L. 112-3, § 2(a), Pub. L. 112-14, § 2, \nPub. L. 114-23, § 705(a) and (c), and Pub.

Standard Minimization Procedures for FBI Electronic Surveillance and Physical \nSearch Conducted Under FISA § 111.D.3.b (\"FBI SMPs for Titles I and III\"); FBI Standard \nMinimization Procedures for Tangible Things Obtained Pursuant to Title V of FISA § III. I (\"FBI \nBR SMPs\").  In contrast, by the tenns of the applicable procedures, FBI queries of\"unminimized \ncontents or non-contents (including metadata) acquired pursuant to Section 702 ... must be \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence infonnation, as defined by FISA, or evidence of \na crime, unless otherwise specifically excepted.\" Querying Procedures used by the FBI in \nConnection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence Jnfonnation Pursuant to Section 702 of \nFlSA §IV.A.I (\"FBI Querying Procedures\"). \nThe FBI has not consistently complied with the three-part querying standard articulated \nby the Government.  In October 2018, the Court concluded that \"the FBJ's repeated non \ncompliant queries of Section 702 information\" precluded findings that its Section 702 querying \nand minimization procedures, as implemented, satisfied the definition of \"minimization \nprocedures\" at 50 U.S.C. § J8 0I(h) and were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  October \n18, 2018 Opinion at 62.  The Government acknowledged that those improper queries \"generally \n2 \nresulted from fundamental misunderstandings .. . about what the standard 'reasonably likely to \nreturn foreign intelligence information' means,\" and the Court cited the \"lack of a common \nunderstanding within FBI and NSD [i.e., the National Security Division of the Department of \nJustice) of what it means for a query to be reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence \n2  Although that case was a proceeding under Section 7020), the Court's opinion also \nexamined problems with FBI queries of information acquired under Titles I and V of FISA.  Id \nat 70, 76-77. \nSECMill14©1 ©ldllI JSR  Page 3 \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n8E@Mlf,%1f JOl.il01tPVFl8A \ninformation or evidence of crime\" as contributing to the FBI's non-compliance. Id. at 69, 77 \n(some internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Court expected that a requirement for FBI personnel to document their basis for \nbelieving that a query using a U.S.-person query term satisfied the querying standard before \naccessing Section 702-acquired contents information retrieved by the query would help ensure \nthat they recalled and thoughtfully applied the guidance and training they had received on the \nstandard.  See id. at 92-93.  The Government eventually amended the FBI's Section 702 querying \nprocedures to incorporate such a documentation requirement (among other things).  See In re \nDNJIAG 702(h) Certificalion 2018-A, et al., Memorandum Opinion and Order at 8-10 (FISC \nDocket Nos. 702(j)-l8-01, el al. Sept. 4, 2019) (\"September 4, 2019 Opinion\"). As revised, the \nprocedures require \"FBI personnel to provide a written statement off acts showing that the query \nwas reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime\" and the \nFBI to maintain records of such statements of facts \"in a manner that will enable oversight by \nNSD and ODNI.>'  FBI Querying Procedures§§ IV.A.3, lV.B.4 (emphasis added).3  But the \nprimary means of implementing those requirements is for FBI personnel to select from a pre-set \nmenu of broad, categorical justifications, not to prepare a case-specific explanation of why the \nstandard is met for a particular query.  See In re DNJIAG 702(h) Certification 2020-A, et al., \nMemorandum Opinion and Order at 44-47 (FISC Docket Nos. 702(j)20-01, el al. Nov. 18, 2020) \n3  See also October 18, 2018 Opinion at 96 (\"The Court contemplates a brief statement of \nthe query justification - in many cases it should suffice to succinctly complete a sentence that \nstarts 'This query is reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence information [o  r evidence of \ncn.m  e]  be cause . . . .

It is questionable how effectively that \nprocess results in a \"written statement of facts showing\" why each query comports with the \nstandard. \nIn December 2019, \"there still appear[e d) to be widespread violations of the querying \nstandard by the FBI.\" In re DNIIAG 702(h) Certification 2019-A, et al., Memorandum Opinion \nand Order at 65 (FlSC Docket Nos. 7020)-19-01, et al. Dec. 6, 2019) (\"December 6, 20 I 9 \nOpinion\").  Despite that widespread non-compliance, the Court did not find another deficiency in \nthe FBI's querying and minimization procedures for Section 702 information.  The Court \nreasoned that, because the FBI was \"really just starting to implement the [a bove-described] \ndocumentation requirement on a comprehensive basis,\" the improper queries did not undermine \nits prior determination that the FBI' s procedures, as augmented by the documentation \nrequirement, met statutory and Fourth Amendment requirements.  Id. at 68. \nOne of the non-compliant queries discussed in the December 6, 2019 Opinion provided \nfurther evidence of the Jack of a common understanding of the querying standard between FBI \nand NSD.  In August 2019, the FBI queried \"unminimized Section 702 information using the \nidentifiers for approximately 16,000 persons who  '  Id \nat 67. NSD assessed that those queries violated the querying standard, except for queries relating \nto seven persons with \"ties to a  nvestigation.\" Id  The FBI, however, maintained that \nall of the queries \"were reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence information or evidence \nof a crime because \n01'!CJI I!JK  Page 5 \nSECl&IJll◄bl \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n81301UJ'f;f;lf JOPONJ:lf318/t \nId.  The Court found the FBI' s position \n•'unsupportable\" and observed: \"There is no relevant distinction between the \nqueries and other broad, suspicionless queries previously identified by the government and the \nCourt as violations of the querying standard.\" Id. at 67-68 (citing October 18, 2018 Opinion at \n68-69). \nIn November 2020, the Court again surveyed recent reports of non-compliant FBI queries, \nwhich suggested \"that the FBl's failure to properly apply its querying standard when searching \nSection 702-acquired information was more pervasive than was previously believed;\" however, \nmost of those queries «occurred prior to the implementation of the FBI' s system changes and \ntraining\" regarding the documentation requirement.  November 18, 2020 Opinion at 39, 41 \n(e mphasis added). \"In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited the government's \nability to monitor the FBI's compliance\" after those systems changes and training had occurred. \nId. at 41.  Under those «unique circumstances,\" the Court concluded that the latest group of non \ncompliant queries did not undermine its prior determination that the FBI' s procedures, with \nimplementation of the documentation requirement, met statutory and Fourth Amendment \nrequirements.  Id. \nIt is now apparent that such violations continue and that a common understanding of the \nquerying standard still eludes the FBI and NSD.  When NSD oversight efforts have w1covered \nqueries that clearly violated the above-described standard, the FBI has sometimes insisted, \napparently at the management level, that the queries were proper.

NSD found these queries to have \nviolated the querying standard because there was no reasonable basis to expect they \nwould return foreign intelligence or evidence of crime. Id. at 5.  The FBI, however, \nmaintained that querying FISA information using the identifiers for the victims of these \nhomicides - simply because they were homicide victims - was reasonably likely to \nretrieve evidence of crime.

For example, requiring personnel to \naffirmatively select to query FISA information should reduce the nwnber of violations in which \npersonnel inadvertently query FISA information, but they will not address the large number of \ncases in which they intend to do so. See Letter regarding FBI programmatic enhancements to \nfacilitate compliance with applicable requirements regarding queries of Fl SA-acquired \ninformation at 2 (July 26, 2021).  And requiring attorney approval of\"batchjobs of l00 or more \nqueries\" on a particular FBI system may not improve compliance if an inconect understanding of \nthe querying standard is not limited to non-attorney personnel. See id  Jn view of these concerns, \nthe Court is directing the Government to take the steps described in Part III below. \nFBJ's~etween November 2019 and August 2020); Notice of compliance \nincidents regarding the FBI's querying of raw FISA-acquired information, including infonnation \nacquired pursuant to Section 702 of FISA at 3 (Aug. 10, 2021) (\"August l 0, 2021 Notice\") (27 \nqueries conducted by the FBI's  n May 2020 ''usin  the name of a \n~ dt he names of individuals who worked at that  .. to check for any \nderogatory information which would assist FBI in deciding w  et er to  eve op these individuals \nas potential sources\"). \n8 The Court has received no indication that the FBI has changed its understanding of the \nquerying standard since the submission of the May 21, 2021 and May 28, 2021 Notices.  NSD \nhas informally advised, however, that future compliance notices will not describe any dissenting \nviews the FBI may have about whether the querying standard was satisfied. \nPage9 \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nII.  Issues Specific to Queries of Section 702 Information to Retrieve Evidence of \nCrime \nSection 702(f)(2) requires the FBI in certain circumstances to obtain approval from the \nFISC before accessing the contents of communications acquired under Section 702.  Specifically, \nthat requirement applies to accessing such contents -\n(1) if they \"were retrieved pursuant to a query made using a United States person query \nterm,\" \n(2) where the query \"was not designed to find and extract foreign intelligence \ninformation\" \n(3) and was conducted \"in connection with a predicated criminal investigation . .. that \ndoes not relate to the national security of the United States,\" \n( 4) unless \"there is a reasonable belief that such contents could assist in mitigating or \neliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.\" \nSection 702(f)(2)(A), (E).  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review has observed \nthat Section 702(f)(2) appears to be \"intended to address ... compliance with the Fourth \nAmendment,\" and specifically the concern that the \"foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth \nAmendment's warrant requirement ... might not apply in everyday criminal investigations \nunrelated to national security and foreign intelligence needs.\" In re DNJIAG Certifications at 29 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe government has never brought an application to the FISC under Section 702(f)(2).  It \nhas, however, reported a number of violations of this provision.  In December 2019, the Court \nobserved that some of those violations \"resulted in part from the manner in which FBI systems \ndisplayed information in response to queries,\" and stressed the importance of designing system \nmodifications to facilitate compliance with Section 702(f)(2).  December 6, 2019 Opinion at 69-\nPage 10 \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\n70.  In November 2020, the Court expressed concern that \"the default-choice architecture\" for \ndocumenting U.S. -person queries of un-minimized Section 702 information may \"influence \nbehavior or lead to misunderstandings by FBI personnel.\"  November 18, 2020 Opinion at 47-48. \nThe default assumption is that a query is not an evidence-of-crime-only query.9  Unless the \nperson conducting the query affirmatively reverses that default, it will be treated as designed to \nfind and extract foreign intelligence information and therefore not subject to Section 702(f)(2)'s \nrequirements.  See id. at 48.  The  overly broad understanding of when a query is reasonably \nexpected to return foreign intelligence that the FBI advanced in defense of some of the \nueries, see supra at 7-8, provides reason to question whether FBI personnel will \nreverse this default, even when the query's nexus to foreign intelligence is attenuated at best. \nIn the November 18, 2020 Opinion, the Court also expressed concern that this default \nassumption may impede compliance with a reporting requirement applicable to certain evidence \nof-crime-only queries.  See November 18, 2020 Opinion at 48.  The Court first imposed this \nrequirement in November 2015 because it had \"relied on the government's representation that \n'queries designed to elicit evidence of crimes unrelated to foreign intelligence rarely, if ever, \nproduce responsive results'\" from Section 702 information, and \"the Com1 sought reassurance \nthat its 'risk assessment is valid.\"'  December 6, 2019 Opinion at 71-72 (quoting In re DNIIAG \n702(g) Certification 2015-A, et al., Memorandum Opinion and Order at 44 (FISC Docket Nos. \n702(i)-15-01, et al., Nov. 16, 2015)).  Under the current form of this requirement, the \n9 In this Order, the phrase \"evidence-of-crime-only query\" refers to a query designed to \nreturn evidence of a crime, and not foreign intelligence information. \n819Cft1Jlf,\\lfl t O1 301.Ul/t'ISA  Page 11 \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nS~Cftl!!'fi/NOPOftNfli'ISa \nGovernment must, on a quarterly basis, provide specified information about \"each instance in \nwhich FBI personnel accessed unminimized Section 702-acquired contents information that was \nreturned by a query that used a U.S.-person query term and was not designed to find and extract \nforeign intelligence information.\" November 18, 2020 Opinion at 63. 10  The Government also \nmust report on a quarterly basis \"the number ofU.S.-Person queries run by the FBI against \nSection 702-acquired information\" and ''the number of such queries in which the documented \njustifications indicated an evidence-of-crime-only purpose.\"  Id. \nThe Government's reporting indicates that evidence-of-crime-only queries are an \ninfinitesimal percentage of FBI queries of un-minimized Section 702 information.  Indeed, for \nMarch through May 2021 it is reported that the FBI conducted over 1,055,000 queries of such \ninformation using U.S.-person query terms, as well as over 976,000 queries using query terms for \npresumed U.S. persons, but \"none of those queries were conducted for an evidence-of-crime-only \npurpose.\"  June 2021 Section 702 Quarterly Compliance Report at 87 (emphasis added). 11  For \nthe same period, the Government reported no instances of FBI personnel accessing un-minimized \ncontents information returned by an evidence-of-crime-only query that used a U.S.-person query \nterm.  Id at 87. \n10  Queries for which an application is made to the FISC pursuant to Section 702(f)(2) are \nnot subject to this requirement.  Id. \n11  FBI documentation indicated that 14 of the queries fell within the evidence-of-crime \nonly category, but after further examination the FBI concluded that each of them \"either had a \nvalid foreign intelligence purpose, was conducted using solely non-United States person \nidentifiers, or was otherwise not conducted for an evidence-of-crime-only purpose.\"  Id. n.60. \nPage 12 \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)\n\nDocument re: September 2, 2021 FISC Order  Authorized for Public Release by ODNI\nThis reporting strains credulity.  It is theoretically possible that in a three-month period \nthe FBI (which, after all, is a Jaw-enforcement agency as well as a member of the Intelligence \nCommunity) conducted over two million queries regarding U.S. persons and presumed U.S. \npersons, without a single one being designed to return non-foreign intelligence evidence of a \ncrime. But it is far more plausible that the FBI is under-reporting such queries, due to factors \nsuch as the default assumption that every U.S.-person query is designed to return foreign \nintelligence information and the FBI's unreasonably broad understanding of when a query may \nbe reasonably expected to return foreign intelligence information.  In addition to effectively \nnegating the Court's reporting requirements, failure by the FBI to properly identify and document \nevidence-of-crime-only queries is likely to result in violations of Section 702(f)(2) in \ncircumstances where the requirement to obtain a FISC order otherwise applies. See supra at I 0.12 \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe problems relating to FBI querying practices are substantial and persistent.  Failure to \ncorrect them would call into question the continued validity, as implemented, of the FBI SMPs \nfor Title I and Title Ill and the FBI BR SMPs, as well as the ability of a FISC judge to find the \nFBI's Section 702 procedures, as implemented, to be consistent with statutory and Fourth \nAmendment requirements.  Some of the systems modifications and training efforts implemented \nto date have been constructive, especially with regard to situations in which FBI personnel do not \nintend to query un-minimized FISA information.  But they have not been a sufficient response to \n12  The Court is awaiting the Government's assessment of whether recent oversight efforts \nat the  and the  uncovered further violations of Section \n702(f)(2).

In the Court's assessment, these problems are likely to remain intractable as \nlong as the FBI and NSD lack a shared, reasonable understanding of the querying standard and, \nrelatedly, of the parameters of Section 702(£)(2) and the reporting requirements regarding \nevidence-of-crime-only queries. \nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT, by November 1, 2021, the Government \nshall submit: \n(1) draft revisions of the FBI SMPs for Titles I and Ill, the FBI BR SMPs, and the FBI \nSection 702 Querying Procedures that provide a full and explicit articulation of the \nrequirements for querying un-minimized information in language that is consistent across \nthose three sets of procedures, or an assessment of why it is not feasible to do so; \n(2) a description of steps it is taking or wil1 take to ensure that the FBI applies the \nquerying standard in a manner that is consistent with the Government's representations to \nthe Court and the Court's interpretation of that standard in its opinions; \n(3) an explanation of how the phrases \"not designed to find and extract foreign \nintelligence information\" and \"in connection with a predicated criminal investigation ... \nthat does not relate to the national security of the United States\" should be understood for \npurposes of implementing Section 702(£)(2); and \n(4) an assessment of whether the FBI's current systems and practices (a) fully comport \nwith the requirements of Sections IV.A.3 and IV.B.4 of the FBI Querying Procedures and \n(b) facilitate full compliance with Section 702(£)(2). \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nEntered this;). r./( day of ~--6!,,,,W,202 I . \nRc!i~ \nJudge, United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court \n,  ~hie1 Oepuly Cieri<.. \nF;·sc, cerilly tl1at this document is a true  S1361lll'lx/i'NOFORIJ:IFISA  Page 14 \nand \nAuthorized for Public Release on July 21, 2023 FISC Order In Response to Querying Violations (2021)",
