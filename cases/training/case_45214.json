Initial discovery shall continue to be limited to the 135 properties previously identified, not to the much larger number again somewhat obliquely requested by the plaintiff. Based on representations made by defendants' counsel, loan agreements and regulatory agreements for the 135 properties are readily available and shall be turned over by 1/31/2020. The remaining discovery on the 135 properties discussed in the City's 11/27/19 report to the court 69 shall, as previously ordered, be on a rolling basis and must be completed by 6/30/2020, the date the City's counsel informed the court today she believed discovery could be completed. Despite intimations from counsel for the plaintiff, that is more than a reasonable amount of time in which to complete discovery. Counsel for the plaintiff are permitted, although not required, to take the depositions of those who submitted an affidavit/declaration in support of the City's Status Report relating to discovery. 68 . See, e.g. FTC v. Advocate Health Care Network, 162 F.Supp.3d 666, 671 (N.D. Ill. 2016); Tellabs v. Fujitsu, 283 F.R.D. 374 (N.D.Ill. 2012). Compare Schmidt v. Astrue, 496 F.3d 833, 842 (7th Cir. 2007). Should the plaintiff decide to take one or more such depositions, the subject matter is limited to the declarations in the case. Counsel are urged to call chambers at 312-435-5601 if any issues arise during any depositions. Counsel shall continue to file a written status report with declarations three business days before each status hearing with a copy delivered to chambers pursuant to Local Rule 5.2(f). The reports should focus not only on the difficulties claimed to prevent discovery, but on what discovery is next and when it will be made. Mailed notice (jms, ) (Entered: 12/02/2019)"

Dow, Jr: Upon review of the status reports [114, 115] filed on 5/29/2020 and in view of the ongoing effects of all litigation as a result of the current global health crisis, the Court has come to the conclusion that any attempt to regulate the scope of discovery based on the Court's ruling more than a year ago denying Defendant's motion to dismiss would not assist the parties in moving the case forward at this time. The document that embodies the Court's ruling speaks for itself and any guidance that this Court gave the counsel almost a year ago surely is stale by now given the status hearings before Judge Cole and the unfortunate delays in the progress of this and other litigation as a consequence of the pandemic. Moreover, Magistrate Judge Cole has decades of experience managing complex discovery and resolving disputes over the pace and direction of document production, depositions, and every other aspect of litigation. He will be well positioned to give the parties the time and energy needed to help reactivate discovery in this case as counsel are able to resume whatever litigation activities they can consistent with social distancing and other restrictions on access to their workplaces and to third parties who may have information related to this litigation. For these reasons, the motion to clarify 79 is denied as moot and as superseded by subsequent events. Mailed notice (cdh, ) (Entered: 05/31/2020)"

The City has filed a Status Report 170 in which it recounts its efforts to produce certain executed loan and regulatory agreements related to properties previously identified by the plaintiff. The City had been ordered to produce in the first wave of discovery some 100 properties on each of five specified dates. It has now done so. The City's final production of executed loan and regulatory agreements was made on 3/21/21 for the remaining 54 properties. Thus, the initial wave of discovery required by the City has now been completed, and the City's most recent Status Report details the effort required to meet the initial deadline. Thus, the City's most recent Status Report states that its \"review of all non-publicly available Finance Division sources that may contain executed loan and regulatory agreements is complete, and all available executed loan and regulatory agreements related to the properties listed in Exhibit A to the Status Report have been produced.\" [170 at 2]. Given the completion of this first phase of discovery, the parties have submitted a Joint Proposed Discovery Schedule. 171 . That Joint Schedule is adopted and discovery shall be in accord with the following jointly agreed upon dates: All fact discovery, except development inspections, shall be completed by 3/1/22; completion of all development inspections by 7/1/22; plaintiff's expert disclosures by 8/1/22; Defendant's response expert disclosures by 10/1/22; close of oral expert discovery by 12/1/22.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Jeffrey Cole: This case is now 4 years and 4 months old. Despite prior orders in this case, especially dkt# 246, the parties have now filed a joint motion to again, amend a discovery schedule, while they acknowledge they did not anticipate requesting a further extension, \"intervening staffing and family related health issuesand the need to continue to work collaboratively to set deadlinesin order to complete the final outstanding discovery items, has required the parties to jointly move for this short amendment.\" [248, para. 1]. See also [248, para. 5]. The motion also refers to \"one of counsel's serious family health issues.\" [248, para.6]. In effect, the motion asks for a two month extension of the expert discovery schedule from 3/20/23 to 5/8/23, to that extent the motion is granted. The motion also seeks in essence, an extension of the fact discovery schedule from 8/1/22 to 11/28/22. The motion is granted. However, the parties should be under no misapprehension that THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS OF EITHER THE FACT DISCOVERY SCHEDULE OR EXPERT DISCOVERY SCHEDULE beyond the dates set forth in this Order. By the close of the period envisioned in this Order, the case will be almost 5 years old. At the risk of being repetitive, there will be no further extensions of this Order. See Judge Seeger's emphatic denial in 1:18-cv-03275 Boyd v. Pfister et al, \"The Court meant what it said when it ordered that \"this extension is the last.\"\" The schedule set by this Order includes not only depositions but completion of development inspections.

At the hearing, the parties and the Court will discuss (1) how to address the City's motion to exclude expert John Wodatch; and (2) whether the City has any objection to the extra-page request of the United States for the Statement of Interest. On the first issue, the Court generally disfavors multiplying summary-judgment briefs by separating Rule 702 motions from any other type of evidentiary challenges. This approach results in six (and sadly sometimes more) briefs instead of three, and evades page limits (or at the least obscures what is a reasonable expansion of page limits).

If negotiations stall or falter, then the Court will set a trial schedule. During pretrial litigation, the Court will ask the parties to address (among other things) whether the Court is bound for purposes of injunctive relief by any jury decision  on liability; and what the damages presentation at trial would entail. For now, though, the parties shall engage in good-faith settlement negotiations. It would seem that both sides would want to minimize the risks and delay of further litigation, a nd indeed the City naturally should want to fashion an affordable housing \"program\" (whether in statutory or non-statutory terms) that promotes compliance with the federal accessibility laws. The parties shall file a status report, on or be fore 11/04/2024 on the status of negotiations and the proposed next step of the litigation. The tracking status hearing of  10/25/2024 is reset to 11/15/2024 at 8:30 a.m., but to track the case only (no appearance is required, the case will not be called). Instead, the Court will review the status report and set a schedule from there. Emailed notice(eec)"

Certain out of town counsel, for the plaintiff, participated by phone. In discussions with counsel for both sides, it was their view that given the nature of the particular case, the provisions of the MIDP were not appropriate to effectively and expeditiously govern discovery here, and it was requested by all counsel that the MIDP not apply in this case. That request was granted, and discovery will proceed under the usual Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The parties initially shall engage in formal discovery regarding the 139 properties discussed in court today. Counsel shall submit a Joint Proposed Discovery Schedule by 10/9/2019. A few preliminary observations may be in order. [P]rotracted discovery, [is] the bane of modern litigation. Rossetto v. Pabst Brewing Co., Inc., 217 F.3d 539, 542 (7th Cir.2000). The undeniable fact is that under the realities of modern litigation[,] [p]re-trial discovery has become a monster on the loose.... Pre-trial proceedings have become more costly and important than trials themselves. A.H. Robins Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F.2d 994, 1013 (4th Cir. 1986). Thus, it is perhaps more imperative today than ever before that parties engage in discovery in good faith, without gamesmanship, In re Sulfuric Acid Antitrust Litigation 231 F.R.D. 331, 342 (N.D.Ill. 2005), and to cooperate with and facilitate forthright discovery. Johnson v. J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., 280 F.3d 1125, 1132 (7th Cir.2002). See also Mills v. East Gulf Coal Preparation Co., LLC, 259 F.R.D. 118, 130 (S.D.W.Va. 2009). Accordingly, parties must respond with specificity to discovery requests, including by making particularized objections. Hall v. Sullivan, 231 F.R.D. 468, 474 (D.Md.2005). General or boilerplate objections to discovery requests are invalid. BankDirect Capital Finance LLC v. Capital Premium Financing, Inc., 2017 WL 5890923, *2 (N.D.Ill. 2017). This is not to suggest that any of these cautions will not be observed in this case. But given the importance of the case and the inevitable complexity of the discovery that is to follow, it is certainly not inappropriate to share with counsel some of the consistent views of judges throughout the country. See also Frank Easterbrook, Discovery As Abuse, 69 B.U.L.Rev. 635 (1989). Counsel are reminded of Local Rule 16.1(4) requiring that discovery be completed before the discovery closing date. If any issues arise during depositions, counsel are urged to call chambers at 312-435-5601.Mailed notice (jms, ) (Entered: 09/25/2019)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Jeffrey Cole: On September 25, 2019, the parties were ordered to submit a Joint Proposed Discovery Order by October 9, 2019. [Dkt. # 54]. They asked for, and received a one-day extension of that deadline. However, a joint discovery Order was not forthcoming, despite its title. Apparently the parties could not agree on a schedule. Instead, two versions of a discovery schedule were submitted: one by the plaintiff and one by the defendant. The plaintiff's version sought one year of fact discovery and an additional three months of expert discovery. Under this timetable, all discovery is to end on 1/4/21. The Defendant, however, has proposed a different schedule. It wants two years for all discovery [Dkt. # 58] which would end on 10/8/21. In essence, the joint schedule is that in name only. This case was filed on May 13, 2018. On June 4, 2018, defendant asked for, and received, an extension of time in which to file a motion to dismiss and a stay of discovery until that motion was ruled on. [Dkt. # 14, 30]. The defendant's motion to dismiss was denied on March 29, 2018 [Dkt. #35] and, at the next status hearing on April 18, 2019, Judge Dow ordered that discovery proceed \"on a rolling basis as expeditiously as possible.\" [Dkt. # 38](Emphasis supplied). Given what has already gone on, with a long break from discovery at the defendant's behest and Judge Dow's understandable and perfectly proper desire that lost time be made up for, the plaintiff's shorter schedule is more appropriate and will be adopted. Mindful of what the instant case involves, care must be taken not to be consumed by excessive and needless demands for discovery, which are \"the bane of modern litigation.\" Rossetto v. Pabst Brewing Co., Inc., 217 F.3d 539, 542 (7th Cir.2000). See generally Frank H. Easterbrook, \"Discovery as Abuse,\" 69 B.U. L.Rev. 635, 639 (1989). The public interest in the prompt and efficient resolution of legal disputes cannot and should not be ignored. See Fort Howard Paper Co. v. Standard Havens, Inc., 901 F.2d 1373, 1380 (7th Cir. 1990); Weingarten Realty Investors v. Miller, 661 F.3d 904, 913 (5th Cir.2011); Gray v. Schaub, 182 F.3d 921 (7th Cir.1999). Experience, which has a role to play in all cases, United States v Montoya De Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 542 (1985), teaches that the farther in the future a deadline looms, the less seems to be done in the time allowed. If things are not done until the last minute, as is unfortunately so often the case in the law, Gilliam v. Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., 2014 WL 901296, at *4 (W.D. Pa. 2014), then it is better that the last minute comes earlier rather than later. Accordingly, the plaintiff's schedule is adopted. Any requests for extensions must comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b). The defendant's position that the length of 30(b)(6) depositions be determined on an as needed basis is adopted. The duration of depositions is defined by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which govern the discovery in the case absent a showing of some reason why the amount of time provided in the Rules should not be adhered to.

The parties have taken diametrically opposed positions on this issue, with the plaintiff insisting that the 135 properties would only constitute the first phase of what they insist will require discovery far beyond that limited to these properties. The city has a very different view. The extent of fact discovery is a matter to be determined at an appropriate time in the future. The next written status report is due on 7/2/20.

Previously, discovery had been limited to 135 properties, the identity of which was determined by the parties. It was my view that discovery should proceed in segments and should not deal with the 800 or so properties that might be included in those properties adverted to in the Complaint. In my discussion with counsel today it became clear that as to logistical difficulties, largely the result of the coronavirus pandemic, precluding the completion of discovery as to the initial 135 properties and that an extension of that initial phase of discovery was necessary. Accordingly, a three month extension to 11/16/20 is necessary. The time for completion of discovery as to the initial 135 properties is now 11/16/20. I was told today that an examination of the \"loan and regulatory agreements\" pertaining to the initial 135 properties disclosed that a certain number of properties were not properly in the case as outlined in the Complaint. 1 . See also plaintiff's proposal on \"next steps\" for discovery. 124 . It seemed to me that an examination of the loan and regulatory agreements pertaining to the remaining several hundred properties potentially involved in this case would be productive as an initial matter and would help to pare the case down even further than originally envisioned by the plaintiff. Accordingly, discovery as to those properties other than the initial 135 should proceed broader discovery. Indeed, counsel on both sides thought it \"likely\" that such an examination would enable the parties to ascertain what should properly be included in the Complaint. I rejected the City's contention that this limited discovery should await the completion of discovery relating to the initial 135 properties. Accordingly, production of the loan and regulatory documents relating to the balance of the several hundred properties potentially involved in this case shall begin immediately. A closing date for discovery relating to the properties beyond the initial 135 shall be set at a future date. The court wishes to express its thanks to counsel for both sides for their input and assistance in this matter and for the proposed \"next steps\" for discovery. The next telephone status is set for 9/9/20 at 10:00am, and counsel should call (888) 684-8852, access code 5618926#.

I observed that the plaintiff had various forms of relief, should it decide to use them, available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that if plaintiff felt it was appropriate, a motion could be filed. There was also a dispute among counsel regarding certain other matters. I instructed them to have an immediate 37.2 conference and if they could not come to an agreement regarding factual determinations as opposed to legal conclusions about certain matters, the aggrieved party was free to file an appropriate motion seeking appropriate relief. The City of Chicago is again ordered to begin making immediate production on a rolling basis of the items required by the Order of 8/7/20. 126 . Unjustified noncompliance in discovery will not be permitted. Telephone Status Conference is set for 10/13/20 at 11:30am. Counsel should call (888) 684-8852, access code 5618926.#.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Jeffrey Cole: The Plaintiff has filed a Motion to Compel 136 the Defendant to comply with not one, but two previous Orders. [126, 133]. I note that we have been down this road before with the Defendant, with disappointing and unsatisfactory results, as recently as the status hearing on September 21st. In the two months since the first of those two Orders, the Defendant has managed to produce loan agreements for just 15 of the more than 600 developments potentially involved in this case. The excuse offered for this unsatisfactory and minimal compliance is the Pandemic. Everyone has been affected by the Pandemic, not just the City of Chicago and its lawyers. But not everyone has failed in their discovery responsibilities, and none to the degree the Defendant has done here. Counsel and their clients do not own the discovery schedule. See Motorola Sols., Inc. v. Hytera Commc'ns Corp., 365 F. Supp. 3d 916, 921 (N.D. Ill. 2019); United States v. Marder, 318 F.R.D. 186, 192 (S.D. Fla. 2016); Solis v. Washington, 2010 WL 1186184, at *3 (W.D. Wash. 2010). \"'Managing the discovery process is the district court's business....'\" Wanko v. Bd. of Trustees of Indiana Univ., 927 F.3d 966, 969 (7th Cir. 2019). As I said at the previous hearing on this same issue, the performance and excuses continually raised by the City are unacceptable. Another hearing on this matter is scheduled for October 13th, at which I am already inclined due to past history to enter Plaintiff's proposed Order that Defendant produce for 100 Developments each thirty (30) day period until Plaintiff's list is exhausted, either (1) Loan and Regulatory Agreements or (2) confirm that no such Agreements exist in either paper or electronic form. The utility of this solution as a device to quickly and efficiently streamline this case is not denied, nor could it be. But, the Defendant has not complied with prior Orders and instructions and importunings, and one wonders what hope there is that the Defendant will comply with Orders to comply with Orders. But courts are not helpless in the face of perpetual foot dragging in discovery. Consequently, Defendant shall file a written response to Plaintiff's Motion by October 12th. There will be no extensions of this date. The defendant has no one to blame but itself for the position it is in. In its Response, the defendant must address a point not raised by Plaintiff's Motion but one that is necessarily implicated by the City's continued evasion of basic and legitimate discovery requests: why a recommendation that a default judgment should not be entered against the City in the event of continued non-compliance with the discovery Orders entered by this court and which are intended to and will streamline the case. What the Seventh Circuit said in another context in which the City was the victim of discovery abuses, applies equally here where the City appears to be the abuser: \"Enough is enough.\" Banos v. City of Chicago, 398 F.3d 889, 893 (7th Cir. 2005). See also Olcott v. Delaware Flood Co., 327 F.3d 1115, 1126 (10th Cir. 2003). Mailed notice (yt) (Entered: 10/08/2020)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Jeffrey Cole: Video conference held on 10/19/20. On 10/8/20, I entered a lengthy Order, critical of what I perceived to be the City's continued noncompliance with Plaintiff's basic and legitimate discovery requests. 138 . The Order noted that the City had no one to blame but itself for the position it was in, and it referred to the consequences of a continued evasion of basic and legitimate discovery requests by the City. 138 . The defendants were ordered to respond to the Motion by 10/12/20. 138 . Almost immediately thereafter, the Defendant filed its eleventh Discovery Status Report. 139 . On October 12, 2020, four days after my Order, the City filed a Response to the Motion to Enforce Discovery Orders. 140 . A Declaration attached to the City's Response stated there are 715 boxes of Finance Division transactions containing hard copy documents at City Hall and are spread between the Finance Division suite and a separate storage area. [140 at page ID 1648]. The Declaration also stated that the Finance Division had copy documents, of which there were over 100 indices, also stored off site where, the Declaration did not say. In the Plaintiff's Reply 142 it contended that the parties have not reached any sort of agreement with respect to the City's search for electronic Loan and Regulatory Agreements. 142 . After considering the extensive argument by both sides in the recent video status conference regarding the City's claimed efforts to comply with prior Orders, I have concluded that the Motion to Enforce the court's August 7 and September 21 Discovery Orders 136 should be and is granted. Beginning on November 1, 2020 and every 30 days thereafter until the Plaintiff's list of developments potentially involved in this case has been completed, the City shall either 1) produce the required Loan and Regulatory Agreement (in whatever form they exist, if they exist) or explain their absence; or 2) confirm that no such Agreement exists in either paper or electronic form, so far as can be ascertained. As explained earlier, the presence of these documents will establish which entities should not be involved in the case at all and thus streamline the litigation. The representations regarding each of the Loan and Regulatory Agreements shall be made under oath and fully explain the circumstances should a particular Agreement not be producible. And they should confirm that no such Agreement exists in either paper or electronic form. In the event a Loan and Regulatory Agreement contemplated by this Order and the extended discussion during the October 20 status hearing not be producible, the City must explain under oath in a Declaration by an appropriate and competent witness why any particular Loan and Regulatory Agreement could not be produced. This court is hardly unsympathetic to contentions regarding the harm and dislocations caused by the pandemic as the October 8 Order demonstrates. See 138 and Smid v. Molex, 2020 WL 6132221 (N.D.Ill. 2020). However, merely and generally invoking the pandemic as a justification for noncompliance with the straightforward discovery requests in this case will not suffice. A final point regarding the mechanics of the review by the City required by this and earlier Orders: If the Law Department with its quite large number of attorneys representing the City finds it difficult to examine the several hundred boxes in order to determine whether a particular kind of document exists, the City should look beyond the Law Department to the two quite large Firms representing the City of Chicago. These firms have numerous offices throughout the country with many hundreds of lawyers. This is how discovery in major cases, indeed in cases far \"larger\" than this, is often conducted. In short, the excuses provided by the City for its failures to comply with reasonable discovery requests are not acceptable. Counsel should confer together by phone or in person and with sufficient regularity to be able to assure that reasonable and legitimate discovery requests will be honored and that discovery will proceed with sufficient efficiency that discovery may be completed in a reasonable time frame.

However, this is the final discovery extension that will be granted in this four year old case. Counsel are reminded of Local Rule 16.1, which requires that all discovery be completed, not merely scheduled, before the discovery close date. As provided in the Rule, discovery requested before the discovery closing date, but not scheduled for completion before that date, does not comply with the Rule. Finally, what the Fifth Circuit said in U.S. ex rel Taylor v. Hicks, 513 F.3d 228, 238 (5th Cir. 2008) should not be forgotten that \"all good things, including discovery, must come to an end.\" Nothing in this Order is intended to detract in any way from the cooperative spirit that counsel have demonstrated thus far.

There is also some disagreement on the question whether, even if, the parties agree to a further 30(b)(6) deposition, Court approval is none the less required.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Jeffrey Cole: Status conference and continued motion hearing held on 7/21/22. Fact discovery is scheduled to close in this 2018 case 1 on 8/1/22. 236 . On 7/13/22, counsel reported that discovery was proceeding without incident save for a possible issue of a potential 30(b)(6) deposition, requiring, according to the defendant, court approval. 240 . Counsel for the parties were unable to resolve the issue, and the plaintiff has moved to take a second 30(b)(6) deposition, which plaintiff says could span three days. 241 . Phrased differently, the motion asks that the duration of the deposition be expanded from the 7 hours allowed by Rule 30(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to 21 hours, which is 14 additional hours envisioned by the Rule. The defendant has objected to a second 30(b)(6) deposition of any duration. 243 . The plaintiff's motion states that in one of its status reports, it \"expressly reserved\" its right to notice additional 30(b)(6) topics at a later date. [241 at 3]. The plaintiff's motion observes that the defendant did not indicate it would object to further 30(b)(6) testimony. Of course, the defendant did not have to, and \"inferences from silence are perilous.\" Posner, Cardozo: A Study In Reputation, 37 (1990). And in this case, in connection with this motion, no inference will be drawn. What is significant, though, is that nine months ago in October 2021 the plaintiff perceived a potential need for \"further 30(b)(6) testimony,\" id. at 3, but did nothing until discovery was about to close, and only then sought a second Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, whose duration could be as much as 21 hours, if the plaintiff gets what it is seeking. I do not agree with the plaintiff's contention that leave to conduct a second deposition should \"ordinarily\" be granted, with the objecting party bearing the burden to show the deposition would be inconsistent with Rule 26. [241 at 5]. \"[G]eneral propositions do not decide concrete cases.\" Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 76 (1905)(Holmes, J., dissenting). See also Daubert v. Merrell Dow, 509 U.S. 579, 598 (1993)(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Rule governing approval or disapproval of requests for a second 30(b)(6) deposition ultimately is a function of the broad discretion invested in district courts overseeing discovery. Thus, there is no presumptive right answer when a second 30(b)(6) deposition is sought. Exercises of discretion do not presuppose or permit predetermined answers. Discretion means that the result need be only within a permissible range. Indeed, in matters of discretion, two decision-makers on virtually identical facts can arrive at opposite conclusions, both of which can constitute appropriate exercises of discretion. Compare United States v. Boyd, 55 F.3d 239 (7th Cir. 1995) with United States v. Williams, 81 F.3d 1434 (7th Cir. 1996). An abuse of discretion occurs when no reasonable person could take the view of the district court. Mejia v. Cook County, Ill., 650 F.3d 631, 635 (7th Cir. 2011); United States v. Banks, 546 F.3d 507, 508 (7th Cir. 2008); U.S. v. Re, 401 F.3d 828, 832 (7th Cir. 2005). Cf. United States v. Bullion, 466 F.3d 574, 577 (7th Cir. 2006)(Posner, J.)(\"The striking of a balance of uncertainties can rarely be deemed unreasonable....\"). Indeed, \"substantial discretion... ensures inconsistency.\" Johnson v. Daley, 339 F.3d 582, 593-94 (7th Cir. 2003). Following the conclusion of the writing of this Order, the plaintiff filed a status report 245 stating that in a conversation with the City, one of its lawyers had agreed to one additional day of 30(b)(6)deposition testimony [245 at 2, 5-6] and would agree to forego the additional two days the plaintiff had requested. According to the status report, the defendant rejected this offer, saying that \"it would only remove its objection if plaintiff agreed to 3 1/2 hours of testimony. [245 at 2, 7]. The City responded a bit later that a 7 hour deposition was not acceptable, but it would remove its objection to an additional 30(b)(6) deposition if plaintiff would agree that the proposed deposition would only last 3 1/2 hours. That offer was declined and the parties had reached an impasse over whether the deposition should lasat 7 hours or 3 1/2 hours. Given the totality of circumstances as presented by the parties in 241, 243, 245, the plaintiff's motion is granted to the extent that it seeks to take a second Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. It is denied insofar as it seeks an additional 14 hours to depose the witness. Counsel on both sides of this case are reminded of the Fifth Circuit's admonition quoted in the Minute Order of 6/21/22 236 : \"All good things including discovery must come to an end.\" U.S. ex rel Taylor v. Hicks, 513 F.3d 228, 238 (5th Cir. 2008). And they should keep in mind the wise admonition of Judge Moran: \"Parties are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to investigate the facts-and no more.\" Vakharia v. Swedish Covenant Hosp., 1994 WL 75055, at *2 (N.D. Ill. 1994). With all deference, I am constrained to say that the controversy that involves whether a deposition should be 3 1/2 or 7 hours ill becomes our profession and helps explain Judge Posner's lament that \"protracted discovery, [is] the bane of modern litigation.\" Rossetto v. Pabst Brewing Co., Inc., 217 F.3d 539, 542 (7th Cir.2000). The presently scheduled date for the close of fact discovery will stand. See also 236 . Emailed notice (yt) (Entered: 07/21/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>This action challenges the state of Illinois&rsquo; housing practices for alleged failure to comply with federal disability accessibility law.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2018, Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago, Inc., an Illinois-based disability advocacy nonprofit, sued the City of Chicago in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern District. Plaintiff observed that Chicago had developed and supported affordable housing initiatives (&ldquo;Affordable Rental Housing Program&rdquo;) since 1988 with the assistance of Department of Housing and Urban Development (&ldquo;HUD&rdquo;) and other federal funding. Utilizing such funding, Chicago provided grants and loans to private developers and nonprofit organizations to build or maintain affordable housing units in the city. However, plaintiffs pointed out that although federal law required that the Affordable Rental Housing Program (as a recipient of federal funding) meet federal accessibility standards, Chicago had failed to implement and enforce policies that would make the program meaningfully accessible to people with disabilities. By failing to provide necessary architectural and programmatic accessibility to the housing units it built, Chicago had effectively excluded such individuals from the affordable housing program and perpetuated discrimination against such individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, plaintiff argued that Chicago&rsquo;s discriminatory actions with respect to its affordable housing program violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (hereinafter &ldquo;Title II&rdquo;), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (hereinafter &ldquo;Section 504&rdquo;), and the Fair Housing Act, which outline necessary accommodations that must be made for individuals with disabilities. In its complaint, plaintiff pled for declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the city from supporting affordable housing units which are not compliant with federal disability accessibility law, as well as require remedial action to come into compliance with those accessibility requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The matter was assigned to the Honorable Robert M. Dow, Jr. The case was later re-assigned to the Honorable Ronald A. Guzman, but then re-assigned again in May 2023 to the Honorable Edmond E. Chang.</p>\r\n<p>On July 9, 2018, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that plaintiff lacked standing to bring the suit on behalf of individuals with disabilities and, furthermore, that plaintiff failed to state a claim as plaintiff did not identify with particularity specific instances of alleged disability discrimination in its complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2019, the court denied defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. In issuing this decision, the court examined both parts of defendant&rsquo;s argument for dismissal. With respect to defendant&rsquo;s standing argument, the court held that, as the &ldquo;injury in fact&rdquo; standing requirement is a low bar in the housing discrimination context for housing organizations, plaintiff had sufficiently demonstrated that it had invested resources to combat defendant&rsquo;s allegedly discriminatory housing practices &ndash; therefore meeting standing requirements. With respect to defendant&rsquo;s argument that plaintiffs failed to state a claim, the court held the plaintiff need not allege specific details for their complaint in order to state a claim; in fact, the court found that plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint, which outlined the applicable legal requirements of federal disability accessibility law and the ways that the City had failed to ensure compliance, contained enough factual content for the court to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, the parties engaged in creating and executing a discovery plan and schedule. The parties negotiated extensively via regular status conference, but continued to disagree as to the appropriate parameters of discovery. Plaintiff filed a motion with the court on December 16, 2019, requesting clarification on the scope of discovery and/or enforcement of the court&rsquo;s decision denying the motion to dismiss, arguing that the timing and sequence of discovery is critical to ensure resolution of plaintiff&rsquo;s claims and that defendant improperly framed the case and discovery as being about atomized incidents of discrimination and not systemic issues.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a public emergency on March 30, 2020, affecting all open cases. On May 2020, the court scheduled a telephonic status conference to discuss any impact that the pandemic may have on the contemplated discovery schedule, and concluded that its 2019 decision on defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss would not be appropriate to regulate the scope of discovery, despite plaintiff&rsquo;s motion, particularly in light of the ongoing litigation issues and global health crisis. The telephonic status conference was held on June 3, 2020; as discovery remained incomplete and still ripe for further discussions and negotiations, the court continued to order written status conferences. The court oversaw those continued discussions and status conferences/reports, and ordered some limited discovery in August and September; after the defendant did not comply, citing COVID-19 related issues, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel.</p>\r\n<p>On October 21, 2020, the court noted that defendant had continued to fail to fully comply with the court&rsquo;s discovery orders, and its rationales for noncompliance (namely, the volume of documents to identify and the pandemic) were unconvincing, as issues that other litigants in the city commonly face. As such, the court held it was appropriate to grant the motion to enforce those orders. Defendant eventually complied, submitting all ordered discovery; discovery exchanges continued for the next three years, with interim extensions of the discovery schedule granted by the court.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2023, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendant primarily argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were grounded in federal accessibility laws, which did not cover the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Affordable Rental Housing Program because the program was not a &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;activity&rdquo; within the meaning of the federal laws.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. Government through the Department of Justice submitted a Statement of Interest in the case on December 12, 2023. In its Statement, the Government clarified its understanding that Section 504 and Title II cover all programs or activities of a public entity, and its view that Chicago is liable for its failure to create accessible programs, even in contracting with private developers to build affordable housing.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2024, the court issued its memorandum opinion and order, denying defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. For the Section 504 and Title II claims, noting that the two federal laws used almost identical language, the court noted that while there was no definitive text to resolve the statutory interpretation issue, the regulations were intended to be broad and the Seventh Circuit had provided illustrative guidance that (1) a government entity cannot avoid its statutory obligations by ceding its functions to private entities, as here, and (2) governing regulations contemplate the possibility that liability may attach to some relationships. Between public and private actors. The court held that a jury is entitled to decide whether the Affordable Rental Housing Program is a qualifying &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;activity&rdquo; of the City, and if so, if plaintiff was denied the benefits of that program or activity. For the Fair Housing Act claim, the court reasoned that a reasonable jury could find that the defendant must comply with the Housing Act, especially given that the Act was always intended to be interpreted broadly. While defendant also raised a statute of limitations argument that the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims were time-barred, the court found that a reasonable jury could in fact determine the statute of limitations had not expired because defendant engaged in a continuous pattern of discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>In issuing its denial of the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, the court also ordered the parties to engage in settlement negotiations, stating that it would set a trial schedule if negotiations were to stall or falter, and set a status report deadline. The parties entered into such negotiations, filing the court-requested status report on those discussions in November 2024. The parties noted that they had exchanged mediator candidates, and hoped to set an initial mediation soon.</p>\r\n<p>The parties presumably are still engaged in settlement discussions, to attempt to avoid further litigation action. A status update is not available as of April 20, 2025, but the case is still active.</p>",

Dow, Jr. \n  ) \nv.  ) \n  ) \nCITY OF CHICAGO,  ) \n  ) \nDefendant.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \nPlaintiff Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Access Living”), \nbrings this action against Defendant the City of Chicago (“Defendant” or “City”), for alleged \nviolations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, and the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) (collectively, the “Federal Accessibility \nLaws”).  Currently before the Court is Defendant’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint for lack \nof standing and failure to state a claim [24].  For the reasons explained below, Defendant’s motion \n[24] is denied. \nI.  Background1 \n  The complaint alleges that over the last thirty years, the City has distributed hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to non-profit and private developers to build or rehabilitate more than 50,000 \naffordable rental units in more than 650 developments across the City.  [1] at 1, ¶ 1 & 14-15, ¶ 53.  \nThe complaint refers to this as the City’s “Affordable Rental Housing Program” or the “Program.”  \nAccording to the complaint, the City—as a public entity, recipient of federal funds, and active \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of the City’s motions to dismiss, the Court assumes as true all well-pled allegations set forth \nin Plaintiff’s complaint.  See [1]; Calderon-Ramirez v. McCament, 877 F.3d 272, 275 (7th Cir. 2017).  \n\nparticipant in the development of affordable housing—has a duty under the Federal Accessibility \nLaws to ensure that owners of developments in the Program comply with federal accessibility \nrequirements.  [1] at 16, ¶ 60 & 19-20, ¶ 71.  The City also must ensure that the Program as a \nwhole is accessible to people with disabilities and does not discriminate against people with \ndisabilities in its terms, conditions, or privileges, or in the provision of services or facilities.  Id. at \n16-17, ¶¶ 61-62.   \n  The complaint alleges that although the City offers low-income residents more than 50,000 \naffordable units in the Program, it has failed to ensure that sufficient units are available to people \nwith disabilities, resulting in Chicagoans with disabilities being forced to live on the street, in their \ncars or homeless shelters, in nursing homes, or in other inadequate and dangerous housing.  [1] at \n29, ¶¶ 110-112.  The complaint details Plaintiff’s extensive investigation into the Program’s \ncompliance  with  the  Federal  Accessibility  Laws,  including  its  randomized  testing  of \napproximately  300  developments  in  the  Program.    According  to  the  complaint,  Plaintiff \ndetermined that none of the properties it tested fully complied with the relevant federal standards.  \nId. at 22-27, ¶¶ 82-99.  For example, the complaint alleges, many of the properties had stairs at the \nmain  entrances,  lacked  doorways  wide  enough  to  allow  wheelchair  passage,  and/or  had \ninaccessible bathrooms and kitchens.  \n  The complaint alleges that the City’s actions and omissions caused these accessibility \nproblems.  In particular, the complaint alleges that the City has no policies or procedures to ensure \naffordable housing units are accessible; does not ensure that accessible, affordable units that might \nbe constructed are made available to and occupied by people who need their accessible features; \nand is unable to identify whether buildings in the Program have accessible units or where such \nunits are located.  See [1] at 27-29, ¶¶ 100-112. \n2 \n \n\n  According to the complaint, the City has the authority, but nonetheless largely fails, to \nrequire developments in the Program to comply with Federal Accessibility Laws.  In particular, \nthe City’s contracts, loan and regulatory agreements, and covenants with developers and owners \ngive  the  City  authority  to  demand  compliance  with  all  applicable  federal,  state,  and  local \nrequirements, and to enter, inspect, and declare a default for an owner’s failure to comply.  [1] at \n13, ¶¶ 44-45.   \n  The complaint alleges that the City’s failure to enforce accessibility obligations has injured \nPlaintiff, which is an organization that promotes independent living for and offers a broad array of \nprograms and services to Chicagoans with disabilities.  Most of these individuals cannot afford to \npay rent without some public assistance due to the many barriers to employment they face.  The \ncomplaint alleges that the City’s failure to make the Program accessible to people with disabilities \nundermines the effectiveness of Plaintiff’s services and makes it more difficult and expensive for \nPlaintiff to attempt to connect clients to accessible, affordable housing.  The complaint further \nalleges that the City’s conduct has required Plaintiff to “divert its scarce resources away from its \neducational  and  other  programs  focused  on  expanding  independent  living  options  for  its \nconstituents  and  toward  efforts  focused  on  securing  compliance  with  federal  accessibility \nrequirements in the City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program.”  [1] at 33, ¶ 133.  For instance, \nthe complaint alleges, the City’s actions have “forced Access Living to divert scarce resources to \nidentify, investigate, and counteract the City’s discriminatory practices” by conducting “site visits, \ninvestigations, surveys, and tests at properties throughout the Affordable Rental Housing Program \nin order to assess the extent of the City’s discrimination, which resulted in the diversion of its \nresources in terms of staff time, travel, and incidental expenses that Access Living would not have \nhad to expend were it not for the City’s violations.”  Id. at 35, ¶ 137.   \n3 \n \n\n  Plaintiff alleges that it filed this lawsuit to address the ongoing diversion of resources and \nfrustration of mission caused by the City’s conduct.  According to the complaint, the City violated \nand continues to violate Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, and the Fair Housing Act by failing to ensure (1) that individual buildings and \nunits within the City’s Affordable Housing Program are built in accordance with architectural \nstandards set by federal law and (2) that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits of its \nAffordable Housing Program as a whole.  The complaint seeks a declaration that the City actions \nviolate Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the FHA.  It also seeks \ninjunctive relief.  In particular, the complaint requests that the City be enjoined from providing \nfunds or assistance for housing units that fail to comply with the Federal Accessibility Laws, from \nfailing to bring buildings and housing units in the Program into compliance with the Federal \nAccessibility Laws, and from failing to provide meaningful access to the Program for people with \nmobility, visual, and hearing disabilities.  The complaint also requests injunctive relief requiring \nthe  City  to  survey  all  units  in  the  Program  and  assess  their  compliance  with  the  Federal \nAccessibility laws; to bring noncompliant units into compliance; to adopt policies and procedures \nto ensure that newly built or renovated housing complies with the Federal Accessibility Laws; and \nto adopt policies and procedures to ensure that owners of buildings in the Program comply with \nthe Federal Accessibility Laws.  \nII.  Legal Standard \n \nThe City has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The City’s Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenges Plaintiff’s \nstanding to bring this lawsuit.  Rule 12(b)(1) “provides for dismissal of a claim based on lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, including lack of standing.”  Stubenfield v. Chicago Housing Authority, \n4 \n \n\n6 F. Supp. 3d 779, 782 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (citing Retired Chicago Police Ass’n v. City of Chicago, \n76 F.3d 856 (7th Cir. 1996)).  Typically, “[i]n ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing, \nthe district court must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, drawing all \nreasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff’s favor.”  Lee v. City of Chicago, 330 F.3d 456, \n468 (7th Cir. 2003) (citing Retired Chicago Police Ass’n, 76 F.3d at 862); see also Moore v. Wells \nFargo Bank, N.A., 908 F.3d 1050, 1057 (7th Cir. 2018); Browner v. American Eagle Bank, 355 F. \nSupp. 3d 731, 732–33 (N.D. Ill. 2019).  However, when “standing is challenged as a factual matter, \nthe plaintiff must come forward with ‘competent proof’—that is a showing by a preponderance of \nthe evidence—that standing exists.”  Lee, 330 F.3d at 468; see also Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, \nRoebuck & Co., 572 F.3d 440, 445 (7th Cir. 2009) (once evidence calling the plaintiff’s standing \ninto question is proffered, the presumption of correctness accorded to a complaint’s allegations \nfalls away, and the plaintiff bears the burden of coming forward with competent proof that standing \nexists).  \nThe City’s 12(b)(6) motion challenges the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s complaint.  For \npurposes of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court “‘accept[s] as true all of the well-\npleaded facts in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.’”  \nCalderon-Ramirez, 877 F.3d at 275 (quoting Kubiak v. City of Chicago, 810 F.3d 476, 480-81 (7th \nCir. 2016)).  To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff’s complaint must \nallege facts which, when taken as true, “‘plausibly suggest that the plaintiff has a right to relief, \nraising that possibility above a speculative level.’”  Cochran v. Illinois State Toll Highway Auth., \n828 F.3d 597, 599 (7th Cir. 2016) (quoting EEOC v. Concentra Health Servs., 496 F.3d 773, 776 \n(7th Cir. 2007)).  The Court reads the complaint and assesses its plausibility as a whole.  See Atkins \nv. City of Chicago, 631 F.3d 823, 832 (7th Cir. 2011). \n5 \n \n\nIII.  Analysis \n \n  A.  Standing \n  “To establish Article III standing, plaintiffs must show they have suffered ‘(1) a concrete \nand particularized injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, \nand that is (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.’”  Gaylor v. Mnuchin, -- F.3d \n--, 2019 WL 1217647, at *3 (7th Cir. Mar. 15, 2019) (quoting Freedom from Religion Foundation, \nInc. v. Lew, 773 F.3d 815, 819 (7th Cir. 2014)).  The City argues that Plaintiff’s complaint should \nbe dismissed for lack of standing because Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to establish any \nof the three required elements of standing.   \n  As to the first requirement, a concrete and particularized injury in fact, the City argues that \nall of the expenditures Plaintiff has made as a result of the City’s alleged failure to comply with \nthe Federal Accessibility laws are “either part of its core mission or things it specifically receives \ngovernment funding to do.”  [25] at 2.  The City contends that because “Plaintiff already spends \nits time and money on investigating discrimination as part of its purpose, it cannot be said to have \n‘diverted’ anything” to pursue this litigation.  Id. at 9, n.4.  For instance, the City points to evidence \nthat from 2008 through 2016, Plaintiff received federal funding specifically for “the investigation \nof housing discrimination complaints and the administrative or judicial enforcement of federal, \nstate, or local fair housing laws.’”  Id.  The City asserts that, under Plotkin v. Ryan, 239 F.3d 882 \n(7th  Cir.  2001),  Plaintiff’s  expenditures  on  investigating  and  litigating  the  City’s  alleged \nnoncompliance with the Federal Accessibility Laws are insufficient to constitute a concrete and \nparticularized injury in fact for purposes of standing.  \n  Plotkin  concerned  the standing  of  the  Better  Government  Association  (“BGA”)—an \norganization devoted to exposing government corruption—to bring a suit challenging alleged fraud \n6 \n \n\nin the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office in connection with the Secretary of State’s gubernatorial \ncampaign.  The BGA alleged that it was injured “simply by reason of its expenditure of time and \nmoney in pursuing the alleged fraud.”  239 F.3d at 886.  The Seventh Circuit rejected this \nargument, reasoning that “ordinary expenditures as part of an organization’s purpose do not \nconstitute the necessary injury-in-fact required for standing.”  Id.   \n  The Court is not convinced that Plotkin is applicable here, given the well-developed body \nof law (discussed below) specifically addressing the standing of fair housing organizations to bring \nsuit to address alleged housing discrimination.  The City does not cite, and the Court has not \nlocated, any cases in which Plotkin’s “ordinary expenditures” standard has been applied in the fair \nhousing context.  Assuming that Plotkin is applicable, Plaintiff has alleged more than “ordinary \nexpenditures” of time and money to investigate the City’s practices and pursue this litigation.  \nAccording to the complaint, the City’s actions also impede Plaintiff’s day to day operations by \nmaking it much more difficult for Access Living to help place clients in accessible affordable \nhousing and, in turn, provide services to clients in their homes.  This reduces the total amount of \nservices that Plaintiff is able to provide and the effectiveness of those services.  \n  The City focuses little attention on the case law that applies the “injury in fact” requirement \nin the housing discrimination context, which sets a “relatively low bar for a housing organization \nto establish standing.”  H.O.P.E., Inc. v. Eden Management LLC, 128 F. Supp. 3d 1066, 1079 \n(N.D. Ill. 2015).  In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), the Supreme Court \naddressed the standing of HOME—a non-profit corporation devoted to equal opportunity housing \nin the Richmond, Virginia, area—to bring suit challenging an apartment owner’s racial steering \npractices.  The Supreme Court held that HOME’s complaint was sufficient to survive a challenge \nto standing where it alleged that “Plaintiff HOME has been frustrated by defendants’ racial steering \n7 \n \n\npractices in its efforts to assist equal access to housing through counseling and other referral \nservices” and “has had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract the defendant’s \nracially discriminatory steering practices.”  Havens, 455 U.S. at 379.  The Court concluded that if \nthe  defendants’  “steering  practices  have  perceptibly  impaired  HOME’s  ability  to  provide \ncounseling and referral services for low-and moderate-income homeseekers, there can be no \nquestion that the organization has suffered injury in fact.”  Id.  The Court reasoned that “[s]uch \nconcrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain on \nthe organization’s resources—constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests.”  Id. \n  Applying Havens, the Seventh Circuit has made clear that “the only injury which need be \nshown to confer standing on a fair-housing agency” (including nonprofits that promote integrated \nhousing) “is deflection of the agency’s time and money from counseling to legal efforts directed \nagainst discrimination.”  Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521, 1526 (7th Cir. 1990).  As \nthe court of appeals explained, “[t]hese are opportunity costs of discrimination.”  Id.  Even where \nthe organization’s “counseling is not impaired directly,”  the court reasoned, “there would be more \nof it were it not for the defendant’s discrimination.”  Id. (nonprofit corporation that promoted \nintegrated housing had standing to bring action against real estate brokerage firm for alleged \nconduct of steering black home seekers to one village and white seekers to adjoining suburbs in \nviolation of civil rights laws); see also City of Chicago v. Matchmaker Real Estate Sales Center, \nInc., 982 F.2d 1086, 1095 (7th Cir. 1992) (“The Leadership Council is a fair-housing agency.  By \nconducting the investigation into Matchmaker’s activities, the Leadership Council deflected its \ntime and money from counseling to legal efforts directed against discrimination.  The Leadership \nCouncil therefore has standing to sue.”); H.O.P.E., Inc. v. Alden Gardens of Bloomingdale, Inc., \n8 \n \n\n2017 WL 4339823, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 29, 2017) (nonprofit organization’s complaint contained \nsufficient allegations to establish standing to bring suit challenging apartments’ rejection of \napplicants based on mental illness diagnoses, where it alleged that “it provides fair-housing \ncounseling at no charge to housing providers and people seeking housing,” that “individual \ncomplaints  prompted  its  investigation  of  the  Illinois  Supportive  Living  Program,”  and  that \n“conducting the investigation of other Supportive Living Facilities to determine whether the \npractices about which it received complaints were widespread impeded its educational outreach \nefforts and diverted its resources from its other programs”); City of Evanston v. Baird & Warner, \nInc., 1990 WL 186575, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 15, 1990) (nonprofit organization devoted to achieving \neconomic and racial diversity and providing fair housing in the northern suburbs of Chicago had \nstanding to bring FHA suit challenging real estate firm’s alleged racial steering practices where it \nalleged that it “incurred costs as a result of investigating defendants’ real estate practices”). \n  In each of these cases, combatting housing discrimination could be characterized as a core \nmission of the plaintiff organization, [25] at 2, yet the courts concluded that the plaintiff was \ninjured  because  it  was  required  to  expend  resources  to  combat  the  defendant’s  allegedly \ndiscriminatory housing practices.  The City attempts to distinguish Village of Bellwood on the \nbasis that Plaintiff here cannot be said to have “diverted” any resources from its educational \nprograms or programs focused on expanding living options to the instant litigation, because \nPlaintiff “receives a variety of government funding for those precise activities.”  [25] at 9.  The \nCity has not demonstrated, however, that this level of specificity is required to satisfy the \n“diversion of resources” standard.  Even if such specificity were required, the “evidence” relied \non by the City suggests only that Plaintiff has certain dedicated funding streams, not that those \nfunds are more than sufficient to cover all of Plaintiff’s expenses in particular areas or that there \n9 \n \n\nis no overlap in the use of funds, personnel, or other resources.2  Further, Plaintiff alleges not only \nthat the City’s actions have required it to divert resources to this litigation, but also that they have \nundermined  the  effectiveness  and  reach  of  Plaintiff’s  supportive  programs  and  services  by \nrequiring Plaintiff to spend considerably more staff time and money to assist clients in locating \nand securing accessible housing.  In other words, there would be “more of” Plaintiff’s counseling \nand support services “were it not for” the City’s alleged violations of the Federal Accessibility \nLaws.  Village of Bellwood, 895 F.2d at 1526. \n  Turning to the second requirement for standing, the City argues that the complaint fails to \nspecify how Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the City.  As the City emphasizes throughout its \nbriefs, it does not own any of the housing units at issue.  However, the complaint recognizes this \nand is not premised on the City owning any of the units in the Program.  Instead, the complaint \nalleges that the City has the authority to enforce the Federal Accessibility Laws through its \ncontracts, loan and regulatory agreements, and covenants with developers and owners.  See  [1] at \n13, ¶¶ 44-45.  The City presents no evidence that calls these allegations into question.  Further, the \ncomplaint alleges that the City has caused Plaintiff’s injuries by failing to adopt or enforce any \npolicies or procedures to ensure that housing units in the Program are accessible to persons with \ndisabilities or comply with Federal Accessibility Laws.  For instance, the complaint alleges that \nthe City, prior to making funding commitments, does not review architectural plans to ensure \ncompliance with the Federal Accessibility Laws; does not conduct field visits during construction; \nand does not have a process for issuing construction and occupancy permits in a manner that \nensures compliance with the Federal Accessibility Laws.  See id. at 27-28, ¶¶  101-107.  The City \n                                                 \n2 Since the materials relied on by the City are insufficient to call into question the complaint’s allegations \nof injury, the Court does not consider Defendant’s motion to be a “factual” challenge to standing.  See Apex \nDigital, 572 F.3d at 445.   \n10 \n \n\nalso allegedly fails to compile, track and publicize information regarding the location of accessible \nunits in the Program, making it extremely difficult for individuals with mobility and sensory \ndisabilities who need accessible features to find the few units where they might live comfortably.  \nSee id. at 29-30, ¶¶113-119.  While the complaint does not identify specific properties or units that \nfail to comply with the Federal Accessibility Laws, the City does not cite  any case law that would \nrequire such specificity and the complaint’s detailed allegations are more than sufficient to put the \nCity on notice of the basis of Plaintiff’s claims.   \n  The City also argues that the complaint does not sufficiently plead how Plaintiff’s injury \nis likely to be addressed by a favorable decision.  In particular, the City faults Plaintiff for not \nexplaining how the City has the legal right or authority to provide what the City deems the “core \nrelief” requested in the complaint: surveying all housing units for compliance with the Federal \nAccessibility Laws and bringing noncompliant units into compliance.  According to the City, \nPlaintiff has not shown that the City has a legal right to even enter the units in question.  In fact \nhowever, the complaint alleges that the City’s contracts, loan and regulatory agreements, and \ncovenants with developers and owners give the City a right to enter, inspect, and declare a default \nfor an owner’s failure to comply with the Federal Accessibility Laws.  [1] at 13, ¶¶ 44-45.  The \nCity has not presented any evidence to the contrary.  Further, even if the City is correct in its \nsuggestion that it has no legal ability to enter or otherwise obtain data about occupied units, the \ncomplaint requests a broad array of other types of injunctive relief beyond surveying and bringing \nexisting units into compliance.  See [1] at 41-43, ¶¶ 162-163. \n  For these reasons, Plaintiff has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that it has standing to \nbring this lawsuit.  The City’s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is, therefore, denied.  \n   \n11 \n \n\n  B.  Failure to State a Claim \n  In its motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the City argues that the complaint should also be \ndismissed because Plaintiff has not “identified with any particularity when, where, or by whom \nalleged  disability  discrimination  occurred,  instead  relying  on  impossibly  vague,  conclusory \nallegations that do not meet Rule 8 pleading requirements.”  [24] at 2.  While acknowledging that \nthe complaint alleges that Plaintiff contacted nearly 300 developments in the City ranging in size \nfrom 5 to over 700 units who received federal funding between 1988 and 2016, the City contends \nthat this is insufficient because Plaintiff does not identify the developments by name or allege \nwhen they were contacted or where they are located.  The City also acknowledges that the \ncomplaint alleges that Plaintiff observed conditions at 17 developments that posed significant \naccessibility barriers, but faults Plaintiff for failing to allege “when they were visited, how many \nunits in each development were visited, or how those developments were selected,” how those \nunits were “representative of the overall group,” or which City employees were responsible for \nany of the alleged instances of discrimination.  [25] at 13. \n  The Court is not convinced that any of these details are necessary to satisfy Rule 8.  To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint needs to contain only enough “‘factual content [to] allow[] \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.’”  \nLewis v. City of Chicago, 914 F.3d 472, 475 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009)).  Plaintiff’s detailed, well-organized 44-page complaint easily satisfies that \nstandard.  The complaint outlines the applicable legal requirements of the Federal Accessibility \nLaws, describes Plaintiff’s extensive investigation into the City’s compliance with those laws, and \ndetails the variety of ways in which the City has failed to ensure that its Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram is compliant.  The City cites no case law indicating that Plaintiff was required to provide \n12 \n \n\ndevelopment-by-development or unit-by-unit level detail on its investigation or the results thereof.  \nAnd it is easy to see why Plaintiff did not, as that would result in an unwieldly complaint that was \nhundreds of pages long.  As Plaintiff points out, all of the details that the City claims are lacking \n“go to the substantiation of Plaintiff’s claims and methodology,” which “the City is free to explore \nin discovery.”  [33] at 2-3.  \n  Finally, the City argues that, to the extent that Plaintiff’s claims are based on violations \nthat occurred more than two years before the complaint was filed, they are barred by the applicable \nstatutes of limitations.  This issue cannot be resolved at the pleading stage.  Dismissal of a \ncomplaint based on a statute of limitations is appropriate only where the plaintiff has “affirmatively \nplead himself out of court” by “plainly reveal[ing] that [the] action is untimely.”  County of Cook \nv. Bank of America Corp., 181 F. Supp. 3d 513, 520 (N.D. Ill. 2015) (internal citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  The City does not even argue that this is the case here.  Further, the complaint \nexpressly  alleges  that  the  City’s  practices  constitute  a  continuing  violation  of  the  Federal \nAccessibility Laws.  One of those laws, the FHA, provides that a civil enforcement action must be \nfiled “not later than 2 years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory \nhousing practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  “The italicized language was \nadded to the FHA in 1988 to codify the continuing violation doctrine recognized in Havens: \n‘[W]here a plaintiff, pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, challenges not just one incident of conduct \nviolative of the Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the \ncomplaint is timely when it is filed within [two years] of the last asserted occurrence of that \npractice.’”  Bank of America, 181 F. Supp. 3d at 520 (quoting Havens, 455 U.S. at 380-81).  The \ncontinuing violation doctrine has also been applied to claims brought under Title II of the ADA \nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See Deck v. City of Toledo, 56 F. Supp. 2d 886, 894 \n13 \n \n\n(N.D. Ohio 1999) (ADA); D.G. v. Somerset Hills School Dist., 559 F. Supp. 2d 484, 495 (D.N.J. \n2008) (Rehabilitation Act).  Since the City’s alleged violations of the Federal Accessibility Laws \nmay constitute continuing violations, the Court cannot determine at this early stage of the case \nwhether any parts of Plaintiff’s claims are barred by an applicable statute of limitations.   \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, Defendant’s motion to dismiss [24] is denied.  This case is set for status \nhearing on April 18, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. \n \n \nDated: March 29, 2019                   \n                ____________________________ \n                Robert M.

Plaintiff Access Living of Metropolitan Chicago (“Access Living”), a non-profit \ndisability advocacy organization and a Center for Independent Living (“CIL”), brings this action \nagainst the City of Chicago (the “City”) because—over the last three decades—the City has \nfunded and developed tens of thousands of affordable rental housing units without ensuring that \na sufficient number are accessible to people with disabilities as required by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), and the Fair \nHousing Act (“FHA”). As a consequence, low-income people with disabilities struggle to find \nsuitable housing and are often forced to live on the street, in their cars, in nursing homes, in \nhomeless shelters, or in other inadequate and dangerous housing. \n2.  Since at least 1988, the City, through a number of different agencies, has \ndeveloped and supported affordable housing initiatives throughout Chicago with U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and other funding. The City’s efforts \n   \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 2 of 44 PageID #:2\nto develop and support affordable housing using federal, state, and local funding—which have \nresulted in the construction or rehabilitation of over 650 developments with more than 50,000 \nrental units—are referred to as the “Affordable Rental Housing Program.”  \n3.  Despite the City’s acknowledgement that there is a particular need for housing for \nindividuals with disabilities that is both accessible and affordable, Access Living has observed a \nsevere shortage of such housing in Chicago. For years, Access Living has been inundated with \nthousands of requests to assist people with disabilities who are struggling to find accessible, \naffordable housing. Some representative examples include:  \na.  a woman with a significant mobility disability who crawled up 25 stairs to \nthe second floor of a single family house for years because it was the only \nplace she could afford;  \nb.  a man who had both legs amputated and was forced to live in a nursing \nhome because he was unable to find an affordable apartment without stairs \nor with doorways wide enough for his wheelchair;  \nc.  a woman with cerebral palsy who was in and out of homeless shelters for \nyears until she was placed in a public housing unit after twenty years on \nthe waitlist;  \nd.  a woman whose multiple sclerosis progressed while she lived in a walk-up \napartment and who could not find another place to live, and was forced to \ncall the fire department to have firefighters carry her down the stairs and \nback up every time she left her apartment;  \n  2 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 3 of 44 PageID #:3\ne.  a woman whose leg was amputated and was forced to live in a nursing \nhome because she was unable to find an accessible apartment before her \nrental subsidy voucher expired;  \nf.  a woman with a mobility disability as a result of several strokes who could \nnot fit her walker into the bedroom and had to sleep in her dining room; \nand \ng.  a woman with lupus who was homeless for five months after her \napartment caught fire and had to settle for an apartment with stairs despite \nstruggles with mobility because she could not find anything else and was \nat risk of losing her rental subsidy voucher.  \n4.  Many of the individuals who contacted Access Living for help had already \nsearched for housing for years and had become frustrated and depressed because of their inability \nto obtain accessible, affordable housing anywhere in Chicago.  \n5.  In 2016, after years trying to convince the City of the need for more accessible, \naffordable housing and assisting people with disabilities to find the relatively few such units \navailable in Chicago, Access Living began an investigation to determine whether the City was \ncomplying with the accessibility requirements of the ADA, Section 504, and the FHA in its \nAffordable Rental Housing Program. \n6.  Under all three of these federal laws, architectural accessibility is a cornerstone of \nequal opportunity for people with disabilities. With respect to units and buildings it funds or \notherwise develops, the City is obligated to ensure compliance with the architectural accessibility \nstandards mandated by these laws. In addition, the City must evaluate and ensure the meaningful \naccessibility of the Affordable Rental Housing Program as a whole. This includes implementing \n  3 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 4 of 44 PageID #:4\npolicies and procedures to ensure that accessible units are actually prioritized for occupancy by \npeople with disabilities who need the accessible features, and conducting a thorough self-\nevaluation to identify and address any ongoing barriers to accessibility in the Program. \n7.  Access Living’s investigation involved extensive review of publicly available \ndocuments and randomized testing of the architectural accessibility of the units and buildings in \nthe City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program. The investigation revealed that many \ndevelopments in the City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program were not constructed to allow \nindividuals who use wheelchairs or walkers to enter, access, and/or use buildings, rooms, and \namenities.  \n8.  Access Living’s testing confirmed that the developments funded by the City were \nnot and are not built to include units that are physically accessible and usable to people with \ndisabilities. \na.  At over one third of the properties tested, an individual who uses a \nwheelchair was unable to enter the building at all without assistance \nbecause of steps or other barriers.  \nb.  In almost one quarter of the properties tested, the front door was too \nnarrow for a tester who uses a wheelchair to enter a unit identified as \n“accessible.”  \nc.  In almost one third of the properties tested, doors in units identified as \n“accessible” were too narrow for a tester who uses a wheelchair to enter \nthe bedroom and/or bathroom. \n  4 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 5 of 44 PageID #:5\nd.  In more than half of the properties tested, testers using wheelchairs were \nunable to approach the kitchen sink and/or the bathroom sink in units \nidentified as “accessible.” \ne.  In two thirds of the properties tested, there was insufficient space in \nkitchens and bathrooms for testers using wheelchairs to turn around in \nunits identified as “accessible.” \nf.  Over three fourths of the properties tested did not have roll-in showers in \nunits identified as “accessible.” \n9.  Architectural barriers such as these make it difficult, if not impossible, for \nindividuals with mobility disabilities to live in these units in the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram. \n10.  In addition, although the City is obligated under federal law to ensure that units in \nits Affordable Rental Housing Program meet specific federal accessibility standards, the \ninvestigation revealed the City has not historically imposed—and does not currently impose—\nsuch standards on building owners and managers.  \n11.  Access Living’s investigation also uncovered evidence that the City failed to \nimplement and enforce policies necessary to make the Affordable Rental Housing Program as a \nwhole meaningfully accessible to people with disabilities, including any policies to connect units \nwith accessible features to individuals who need those features. \n12.  The City’s decades-long failure to provide architectural and program accessibility \nhas adversely impacted people with physical and sensory disabilities and effectively excluded \nthem from the City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program. The City’s failures continue to the \npresent day. \n  5 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 6 of 44 PageID #:6\n13.  In order to counteract the negative effects of the City’s violations of federal \naccessibility requirements, Access Living has been forced to spend thousands of hours each year \nto assist people seeking accessible, affordable apartments and to advocate for policy reforms to \nincrease housing opportunities for the disability community. As a result, it had to divert staff \ntime and resources away from providing Chicagoans with disabilities with the five core services \nrequired of a CIL:  independent living skills training; services that facilitate the transition of \nadults with disabilities from nursing homes and other institutions into the community and the \ntransition of young adults with disabilities into adulthood; peer support; advocacy; and \ninformation and referral services.  \n14.  Furthermore, the City’s failure to comply with federal accessibility requirements \nfrustrates Access Living’s mission by making it substantially harder to deliver core services to \nChicagoans with disabilities who lack stable housing that is accessible and affordable. It also \ndamages Access Living’s reputation in the community by conveying to funders, clients, and the \npublic at large that Access Living is powerless to address the shortage of accessible, affordable \nhousing for Chicagoans with disabilities.  \nPARTIES \n15.  Founded in 1980, Access Living is a CIL with its principal place of business in \nChicago. It is a non-profit, community-based corporation that provides a wide range of services \nto people with disabilities in the City of Chicago and adjoining areas. As a CIL, people with \ndisabilities make up a majority of the members of Access Living’s Board of Directors and staff.  \n16.  Access Living is mandated by federal law to promote independent living for \npeople with disabilities. Among other activities, it transitions people with disabilities from \nnursing homes and other institutions into fully-integrated settings in the community and provides \n  6 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 7 of 44 PageID #:7\nassistance to those at risk of entering such institutions. It is the only federally-recognized CIL \nserving people with disabilities in Chicago. \n17.  Access Living’s mission is to foster the dignity, pride, and self-esteem of people \nwith disabilities and enhance the options available to them so they may choose and maintain \nindividualized and satisfying lifestyles. \n18.  Access Living is a “person aggrieved” within the meaning of Section 504. 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). Similarly, Access Living is a “person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability” within the meaning of Title II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12133; Innovative Health Sys., \nInc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. 1997). \n19.  Access Living is also an “aggrieved person” within the meaning of the Fair \nHousing Act, and is authorized to commence litigation to obtain appropriate relief against the \nCity of Chicago. 42 U.S.C. §§ 3602, 3612-13. Access Living falls within the zone of interests \nprotected by the Fair Housing Act. Access Living has suffered concrete and particularized \ninjuries that are fairly traceable to the City of Chicago’s conduct and that are likely to be \nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.  \n20.  Defendant City of Chicago is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of \nthe State of Illinois.  \n21.   Since the ADA was enacted in 1990, the City has been a local government and \nthus a “public entity” subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title II of the ADA. \n42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n22.  At all times relevant, the City received federal financial assistance within the \nmeaning of Section 504. \n  7 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 8 of 44 PageID #:8\n23.  Each employee of a City agency who acted or failed to act, as alleged herein, was \nthe actual or apparent agent, employee, manager, or representative of the City and, in doing the \nacts or omitting to act as alleged in this Complaint, was acting in the course and scope of his, her, \nor its actual or apparent authority pursuant to such agencies, or the alleged acts or omissions \nwere subsequently ratified and adopted by the City as principal. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343, 42 U.S.C. § 12133, 29 U.S.C. § 794a, and 42 U.S.C. § 3613.  \n25.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b) because the City operates and performs its official duties therein and thus resides there \nfor purposes of venue, and because a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to \nthe claims occurred in Chicago, which is in the Northern District of Illinois. \nSTATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nI.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act   \n26.  The ADA was enacted “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate \nfor the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities” with “clear, strong, \nconsistent, enforceable standards . . . in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced \nday-to-day by people with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b). \n27.  All public entities, including state and local governments and their departments, \nagencies, and instrumentalities, must comply with Title II of the ADA. This includes ensuring \nthat the public entity’s “services, programs, [and] activities” are provided in a non-discriminatory \nfashion to all qualified individuals regardless of disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.149. \n  8 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 9 of 44 PageID #:9\n28.  The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the federal agency Congress charged \nwith implementing Title II of the ADA, has interpreted the statute to mean that public entities \nthat operate residential housing programs are subject to Title II and must provide accessible \nhousing.  \n29.  DOJ regulations specify that a public entity may not “directly or through \ncontractual, licensing or other arrangements . . . [a]id or perpetuate discrimination” on the basis \nof disability by others to whom it has delegated authority or control of any aspect of a public \nprogram. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). Similarly, the regulations specify that a public entity may not \n“utilize criteria or methods of administration” that discriminate on the basis of disability. 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n30.  A residential housing program subject to Title II must fulfill two obligations:  \n(1) compliance with detailed architectural accessibility requirements; and (2) adoption and \nimplementation of policies, practices, and other measures to ensure that this program—like every \nother City program, service, and activity—when viewed in its entirety is meaningfully accessible \nto people with disabilities. This requirement, called “program accessibility,” applies to all of the \nCity’s programs, services, and activities, regardless of whether a particular program, service, or \nactivity itself receives direct federal funding. \nII.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n31.  The purpose of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is to “maximize employment, \neconomic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion and integration into society” of people \nwith disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1). The Rehabilitation Act is based on findings that \n“individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination in such \ncritical areas as . . . housing” and that “the goals of the Nation properly include the goal of \nproviding individuals with disabilities with the tools necessary to . . . achieve equality of \n  9 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 10 of 44 PageID #:10\nopportunity, full inclusion and integration in society, employment, independent living, and \neconomic and social self-sufficiency.” 29 U.S.C. §§ 701(a)(5), (6)(B). \n32.  All entities receiving federal financial assistance must comply with the anti-\ndiscrimination provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provides that “[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n33.  A “program or activity” includes all of the operations of any state or local \ngovernment department, agency, or other instrumentality, any state or local entity that distributes \nfederal financial assistance, and any state or local department or agency that receives federal \nfinancial assistance. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1). Once “any part” of a “department, agency, special \npurpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government” receives federal \nfunds, Section 504’s non-discrimination requirements apply to “all of the operations of” that \nentity, “regardless of which specific program receives federal funds.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1), (4).  \n34.  Pursuant to Congressional authority, HUD promulgated regulations that specify \nthat recipients of federal financial assistance “may not, directly or through contractual or other \narrangements,” discriminate on the basis of disability, or “utilize criteria or methods of \nadministration the purpose or effect of which would” be to discriminate on the basis of disability. \n24 C.F.R. §§ 8.4(b)(1), (4). \n35.  Like Title II of the ADA, Section 504 requires a federally-financed residential \nhousing program to fulfill two obligations:  (1) compliance with detailed architectural \naccessibility requirements; and (2) compliance with program accessibility requirements. \n  10 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 11 of 44 PageID #:11\nIII.  The Fair Housing Act \n36.  Since 1988, the Fair Housing Act has prohibited discrimination on the basis of \ndisability. Among other things, it prohibits the City from operating a housing program in which \nunits are made unavailable or denied to a person because of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1). \nThe Fair Housing Act also prohibits discrimination in the “terms, conditions, or privileges of sale \nor rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with \nsuch dwelling,” because of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2). \n37.  In addition, Congress defined discrimination on the basis of disability to include \nthe failure to design and construct new multifamily apartment buildings in a manner such that all \nground floor units and units served by an elevator, and the common and public areas that serve \nthose units, include certain accessible features. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3) (“FHA Accessibility \nRequirements”). Those who participate in the design and construction process must ensure that \ncovered units include doors that are sufficiently wide to allow passage, accessible routes, \naccessibly located environmental controls, usable kitchens and bathrooms, and reinforced \nbathroom walls.  \n38.  All participants in the design and construction process are jointly and severally \nliable for the failure to design and construct covered units in compliance with the FHA \nAccessibility Requirements. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The City of Chicago’s Affordable Rental Housing Program  \n39.  The City of Chicago was incorporated in 1837. The Mayor of Chicago is the chief \nexecutive of the City, and appoints the commissioners of the several City departments \nresponsible for the financing, development, and permitting of affordable rental housing units. \n  11 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 12 of 44 PageID #:12\n40.  Since 1974, the City of Chicago has received billions of dollars of federal \nfinancial assistance for housing and community development activities, including funds from \nHUD’s Home Investment Partnership Program (“HOME”), Community Development Block \nGrant, Emergency Solutions Grant, and Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS program \n(collectively, “HUD funds”). For each of the past ten years, the City has received in excess of \n$100,000,000 in HUD funds.  \n41.  The City designates the Office of Budget and Management (“OBM”) as the \nagency that manages, monitors, and enforces the grants management process in conjunction with \nother City departments. OBM is also responsible for applying for and receiving HUD funds, and \nsub-allocates certain of those funds to other City agencies to provide financial support for the \ndevelopment of affordable housing.  \n42.  City agencies administering HUD funds include the Department of Planning and \nDevelopment (“DPD”),1 the Department of Family and Support Services, the Chicago \nDepartment of Public Health, and OBM itself. These agencies, and other City agencies that \nadminister federal, state, and local funding to develop affordable housing, will be referred to as \nthe “City Funding Agencies.” \n43.  The City Funding Agencies do not own the units in the Affordable Rental \nHousing Program, but they award money to third-party developers and owners to construct new \nrental housing units or to rehabilitate existing rental units for the benefit of low-income \nhouseholds.  \n                                                 \n1 The agency currently known as DPD was previously known by other names, including the \nDepartment of Housing and Economic Development and the Department of Housing. For \npurposes of this Complaint, the term “DPD” denotes the current agency and the City’s principal \nhousing department as it was known under any previous name. \n  12 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 13 of 44 PageID #:13\n44.  Each agency has its own competitive mechanisms for evaluating and determining \nwhether and what developments will receive City financial support. However, once a \ndevelopment has been selected, the City Funding Agencies must incorporate all requirements \napplicable to HUD funding programs into any contracts, loan agreements, or other documents \nevidencing the award of funding to third-party developers and owners, including requirements \nconcerning accessibility and affordability.  \n45.  By virtue of such contracts, loan agreements, or other documents, the City \nFunding Agencies have the power to enforce federal and other requirements against third-party \ndevelopers and owners, typically for as long as 30 years or more. \n46.  Once a development receives a funding commitment from one of the City \nFunding Agencies, it becomes part of the City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program. As of the \nfiling of this lawsuit, the Affordable Rental Housing Program consisted of more than 650 \ndevelopments, containing more than 50,000 total rental units. \n47.  OBM sub-allocates virtually all of the HOME funding to DPD to support the \ndevelopment of income-restricted rental housing in Chicago. Since at least 1988, with HUD and \nother funding, DPD has “worked to develop and support affordable housing initiatives citywide” \nand its website provides a list of several hundred affordable rental housing developments \n“supported and developed through the City of Chicago.” \n48.  To comply with federal affordability requirements, DPD developed lease \nprovisions, regulatory agreements, and a sophisticated annual on-site monitoring system to \nensure that owners of developments in the Affordable Rental Housing Program lease rent-\nrestricted units only to low-income tenants. \n  13 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 14 of 44 PageID #:14\n49.  The City is subject to the accessibility requirements of the ADA and Section 504, \nbut maintains no similar system that ensures that developments and units in the Affordable \nRental Housing Program comply with those accessibility requirements. \n50.  Although the website for the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities \n(“MOPD”) says that MOPD “examines . . . plans for compliance with the accessibility \nprovisions of the Chicago Building Code and Illinois Accessibility Code,” and “is available to \nanswer questions about [accessibility laws],” this agency is drastically underfunded and \nunderstaffed. In Fiscal Year 2018, MOPD has just four accessibility compliance employees—\nand a budget of only $367,000—to provide technical assistance, education and outreach, \nconsultation, and plan review not just for all newly-constructed and rehabilitated residential \nhousing, but also for all public buildings and retail and commercial businesses in the City of \nChicago.  \n51.  The City Funding Agencies do not have any obligation to consult with MOPD or \nsubmit any plans to MOPD for its approval prior to making funding commitments to developers \nfor projects that become part of the Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n52.  For purposes of the FHA, the City’s selection of funding applications, its entry \ninto long-term funding and regulatory agreements with developers, and its provision of financing \nfor the development of units in the Affordable Rental Housing Program make it a participant in \nthe design and construction of the resulting newly-constructed multifamily housing. \n53.  Over the last three decades, the City has used hundreds of millions of dollars in \nfederal funds, as well as state, local, and private resources, for the development, construction, \nand/or rehabilitation of thousands of rental units in the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n  14 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 15 of 44 PageID #:15\nII.  The Need for Accessible, Affordable Housing in the City of Chicago.  \n54.  There are hundreds of thousands of individuals with ambulatory, vision, and/or \nhearing disabilities in Chicago, as the City itself recognizes. \n55.  Many of these individuals with disabilities need accessible, affordable housing. \nChicagoans with disabilities face many barriers to employment and, as a result, a \ndisproportionate percentage are low income and require either housing-payment assistance or a \nsubsidized unit. Only 28% of people with disabilities in Chicago are employed and more than \none third live below the federal poverty line; in comparison, 70.5% of people without disabilities \nin Chicago are employed and less than one fifth live below the federal poverty line. This gap has \nexisted for many years. In 2006, the median income for an individual with a disability was \n$20,114, and the median income for an individual without a disability was $28,476. In 2016, the \nmedian income for an individual in Chicago with a disability was $22,247, while the median \nincome for an individual without a disability was $35,733. \n56.  In addition, many individuals with disabilities rely on Supplemental Security \nIncome (“SSI”). SSI is the federal assistance program for people with significant and long-term \ndisabilities who have little or no other income, with a federal payment standard of just $750 for \n2018. That paltry amount is not enough to cover the rent on a typical studio or one-bedroom \napartment in Chicago and, even if it were enough, it would leave the recipient without funds to \npay for food, clothing, utilities, transportation, and other necessities. Because many Chicagoans \nwith disabilities are not able to find affordable housing on the open market, they are especially in \nneed of assistance from the City’s Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n57.  The need for accessible, affordable housing is particularly acute for individuals \nunder 62 who are not old enough to qualify for senior housing. Although only approximately \n  15 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 16 of 44 PageID #:16\n10% of individuals with disabilities in Chicago are over 65, approximately 22% of the units in \nthe Affordable Rental Housing Program are in seniors-only housing.  \n58.  These demographics demonstrate that there is and has been a substantial need for \naccessible units within the Affordable Rental Housing Program for several decades. In its 2015 \nConsolidated Plan, the City itself recognized that “[t]he [dual] effect of a low income and \ndecreasing affordable housing stock has proven extremely problematic to the elderly and those \nwith disabilities,” and acknowledged that the “gap between supply and demand for rental \nhousing in Chicago continues to pose problems, particularly for . . . persons with disabilities.” \nIII.  The City is Required to Ensure Architectural and Programmatic Accessibility in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program \n59.  Under the ADA and Section 504, the City is obligated to ensure meaningful \naccessibility across the Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n60.  The City is required to take affirmative steps to ensure compliance with the \narchitectural accessibility standards mandated by federal law. This includes reviewing \nconstruction documents and completed projects for compliance, ensuring developers are on \nnotice about accessibility requirements, and monitoring and enforcing compliance by developers \nand managers. In addition, program accessibility requires the City to evaluate the architectural \naccessibility of the Affordable Rental Housing Program as a whole.  \n61.  Program accessibility also mandates that the City take steps to ensure that \naccessible units that are part of the Affordable Rental Housing Program are meaningfully made \navailable to individuals with disabilities who need them. Among other things, the City must:  \nmaintain lists of accessible units and their accessible features and make that information public; \noffer available accessible units to people who need the accessible features; adopt affirmative \nmarketing to people with disabilities; provide accessible methods of application; and ensure \n  16 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 17 of 44 PageID #:17\ndevelopers and managers of properties in the Program put the same mechanisms in place. It \nfurther requires the City to engage in a self-evaluation of the accessibility of the program, and to \ncreate a targeted plan to address any deficiencies identified in that evaluation. \n62.  In addition, the City is obligated under the FHA to ensure that it does not \ndiscriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges, or in the provision of services or facilities, in \nconnection with the Affordable Rental Housing Program. The City is also required to ensure that \nit does not deny or otherwise make unavailable to individuals with disabilities the units in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program. The failure to ensure meaningful accessibility in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program is relevant to whether or not the City discriminates against \nindividuals with disabilities under the FHA. \nA.  Relevant Architectural Accessibility Requirements \n63.  Architectural accessibility is a key component of a residential housing program’s \noverall accessibility. If people cannot get into or reside in the affordable dwelling units the \nprogram creates, the program is not accessible to those individuals. \n64.  The three federal statutes relevant to this litigation—the ADA, Section 504, and \nthe FHA—require the City to comply with overlapping obligations to ensure accessibility in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program. The first two require a very high level of accessibility in a \nprescribed fraction of units in each building—including features such as roll-in showers, lowered \ncountertops, extra wide doorways, large “clear floor space” areas in kitchens and bathrooms, the \ninstallation of multiple grab bars, and others—as well as accessible common areas and accessible \npaths of travel throughout the development. The FHA requires a more modest level of \naccessibility in all ground floor units and all units served by an elevator, together with \naccessibility in common areas and paths of travel that are similar to those under the ADA and \nSection 504. \n  17 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 18 of 44 PageID #:18\n65.  Because of the significantly greater level of accessibility required under the ADA \nand Section 504, its standards will be referred to as the “heightened accessibility standards,” and \nthe FHA Accessibility Requirements will be referred to as “basic accessibility standards.” \n66.  As a public entity, the City must comply with regulations under Title II of the \nADA. Under Title II, for new construction commencing after January 26, 1992, the City must \nensure apartment buildings are “designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part \nof the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.151(a)(1). From that commencement date until the ADA regulations were amended in 2012, \nthe scoping and technical standards for such units were supplied by the Uniform Federal \nAccessibility Standards (“UFAS”), which requires that five percent (5%) of the total dwelling \nunits in new multifamily housing projects receiving federal financial assistance meet heightened \nrequirements for accessibility for people with mobility disabilities, and an additional two percent \n(2%) must be accessible per heightened requirements for people with hearing or vision \ndisabilities. See 24 C.F.R. § 8.22. Alterations of existing buildings must conform to similar \nrequirements “to the maximum extent feasible.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b)(1).  \n67.  As of March 15, 2012, the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \nGuidelines (“ADAAG”) provide mandatory accessibility requirements—both scoping and \ntechnical—for residential buildings constructed or altered by, or with the assistance of, local \ngovernment entities such as the City. ADAAG also requires five percent (5%) of the total \ndwelling units to provide heightened mobility features, and an additional two percent (2%) to \nprovide heightened communication features for people with hearing or vision disabilities. See \n2010 ADA Standards, ch. 233. \n  18 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 19 of 44 PageID #:19\n68.  In addition, by virtue of receiving federal financial assistance, the City is required \nto ensure that the scoping and technical requirements of the UFAS accessibility standards are \napplied to newly-constructed and substantially rehabilitated properties in the Affordable Rental \nHousing Program, including those receiving direct federal financial assistance. 24 C.F.R. \n§§ 8.20, 8.22, 8.23, 8.32. \n69.  Because the City has acted and continues to act as a developer of residential \nmulti-family developments with four or more units built for first occupancy after March 13, \n1991, through its Affordable Rental Housing Program, those developments must also comply \nwith the FHA Accessibility Requirements. It is jointly and severally liable for any failure to \ndesign and construct in accord with those requirements.  \nB.  Ensuring and Evaluating Architectural Accessibility  \n70.  The City is obligated to ensure compliance with the heightened and basic \narchitectural accessibility requirements in the Affordable Rental Housing Program. In addition, it \nmust evaluate architectural accessibility as a whole throughout the Program. \n71.  In furtherance of its obligations, the City must adopt policies and procedures to \nensure housing units and common areas in the Affordable Rental Housing Program are designed \nand constructed consistent with the relevant federal architectural accessibility standards. Among \nother things, the City must: \na.  review construction documents for developments in the Affordable Rental \nHousing Program to ensure they are designed to comply with architectural \naccessibility and other requirements;  \nb.  inspect projects during the construction process to ensure compliance with \narchitectural accessibility requirements; \n  19 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 20 of 44 PageID #:20\nc.  inspect completed projects to ensure compliance with architectural \naccessibility and other requirements at the time of their completion and at \nregular intervals over the time in which they are part of the Affordable \nRental Housing Program;  \nd.  ensure developers are on notice of specific requirements for developments \nin the Affordable Rental Housing Program, including accessibility \nrequirements; and \ne.  monitor and enforce compliance by third party developers and managers \nwith relevant architectural accessibility requirements.  \n72.  Furthermore, the City must consider the architectural accessibility of the portfolio \nas a whole.  \n73.  The City must also assess whether accessible units are distributed throughout \nhousing projects and sites to the maximum extent feasible and are available in a range of sizes \nand amenities so that a person with a disability has a choice of living arrangements comparable \nto that of others. \nC.  Ensuring Individuals Who Need Them Can Find and Are Placed in Units \nWith Accessible Features  \n74.  As part of ensuring program accessibility, the City must take steps to ensure that \naccessible dwelling units in its Affordable Rental Housing Program are made available to and \noccupied by people who need the accessible features of those units. Among other things, it must:  \na.  maintain a list of accessible units and their accessible features;  \nb.  respond to requests from members of the public concerning the location of \naccessible units;  \nc.  offer available units first to people who need the accessible features; \n  20 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 21 of 44 PageID #:21\nd.  adopt policies and procedures to ensure that accessible units are occupied \nby people who need the accessible features; \ne.  adopt affirmative marketing procedures that will actually attract eligible \ntenants without regard to, among other things, disability; and \nf.  provide accessible methods of applying for accessible units. \n75.  Under federal law, the City must require participating private entities to take the \nsame steps, including offering available accessible units to people who need the accessible \nfeatures first and adopting affirmative marketing procedures. However, the City has failed to \ncreate such requirements. \nD.  Evaluation of the Affordable Rental Housing Program  \n76.  Finally, in order to establish and maintain program accessibility, the City must \nregularly evaluate the Affordable Rental Housing Program’s current services, policies, and \npractices.  \n77.  To maintain programmatic accessibility, the City must conduct a self-evaluation \nthat identifies barriers to accessibility in the Program and develop a transition plan to correct any \ndeficiencies identified.  \n78.  As part of the self-evaluation, the City must:  identify the scope of the overall \nneed for accessible rental housing in the area served by the Affordable Rental Housing Program; \nassess and ensure that architectural accessibility standards are being met; and identify and assess \nhow and whether policies and procedures are in place to make accessible units available to those \nwho need them, as described in paragraph 74. \n  21 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 22 of 44 PageID #:22\nIV.  The City Failed to Ensure Architectural and Programmatic Accessibility in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program \n79.  Access Living conducted a months-long investigation into the City’s Affordable \nRental Housing Program that included testing, interviews, public records requests, and review of \npublicly available documents.  \n80.  The investigation revealed that, by any measure, the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram is inaccessible to people with disabilities. The City’s failure to ensure the accessibility \nof the Program has a different and disparate impact on people with mobility and sensory \ndisabilities who have a particular need for housing with accessible features, and effectively \nexcludes them from the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \nA.  Developments in the Affordable Rental Housing Program Do Not Comply \nWith Applicable Accessibility Standards \n81.  Access Living’s investigation revealed that for thirty years and continuing into the \npresent, the City failed to ensure that developments in the Affordable Rental Housing Program \nwere designed and constructed in accord with applicable accessibility standards so as to be \naccessible to individuals with disabilities. \n82.  Access Living’s investigation included systematic, randomized testing of \ndevelopments in the Affordable Rental Housing Program for compliance with ADAAG, UFAS, \nand FHA Accessibility Requirements. None of the properties tested by Access Living fully \ncomplied with any of those standards.  \n83.  Access Living contacted nearly 300 developments in the Affordable Rental \nHousing Program to inquire about available accessible, affordable units. These properties include \nmultifamily housing, permanent supportive housing, and single room occupancy developments; \nrange in size from five units to more than 700 units; are located around the City; and received \nfinancing from the City between July 1988 and 2016. \n  22 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 23 of 44 PageID #:23\n84.  Management agents for dozens of developments in the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram represented that their buildings did not have any accessible units at all. Some agents \nstated they only had walk-up units or that all units in the building were only reachable via stairs. \nThis included buildings that received funding from the City over the last thirty years, including \nwithin the last two years. \n85.  Many agents stated that no units in their buildings, including buildings developed \nby the City within the last two years, contained roll-in showers. Such showers are required in a \nsubset of units within each building to comply with the heightened accessibility standards.  \n86.  Management agents also repeatedly told Access Living callers that they had long \nwaiting lists, with hundreds of people on them, and predicted wait times of up to ten years. These \ndevelopments did not maintain separate wait lists for units with accessible features. One leasing \nagent advised the Access Living caller to check retirement homes because they occasionally \nadmit individuals who use wheelchairs but do not meet the age requirements. \n87.  Access Living was able to observe conditions at 17 developments in the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program. At each of these developments, Access Living identified \nsignificant accessibility barriers that rendered the developments out of compliance with UFAS, \nADAAG, and/or the FHA Accessibility Requirements.  \n88.  There were multiple developments tested whose front entrances could not be \nreached by individuals who use wheelchairs, as there were stairs or other barriers at the main \nentrance to the building or unit. If an individual in a wheelchair cannot even enter the building, it \nis not accessible under any accessibility standard. \n89.  Multiple developments lacked doorways sufficiently wide to allow passage by a \nwheelchair user, including into bathrooms and bedrooms. These narrow doorways impede the \n  23 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 24 of 44 PageID #:24\nability of potential residents to live there and prevent residents from having guests who use \nwheelchairs. These doorways violate both the heightened and basic accessibility standards. \n90.  In multiple tested units, countertops were higher than 34 inches. Such countertops \ndo not satisfy the heightened accessibility standards, which require lowered counter space usable \nby an individual who uses a wheelchair.  \n91.  Multiple tested units did not provide the space or features necessary for \nwheelchair users to use key kitchen appliances comfortably and safely, which significantly \nimpedes the unit’s overall accessibility and does not comply with federal accessibility standards.  \na.  In several tested units, a wheelchair user could not access the kitchen sink \nby a forward approach because there were cabinets blocking access. In \nthose units, under-sink cabinets were not constructed to be easily \nremovable. This violates both the heightened and basic accessibility \nstandards. \nb.  In several tested units, the kitchen sink lacked lever hardware, which is \nnecessary for individuals who have difficulty gripping or maneuvering \nwith their hands. This violates the heightened accessibility standards. \nc.  In certain tested units, the controls for the range were located on the back \nof the stove, rather than at the front. This is dangerous for wheelchair-\nusers as they have to extend their arm directly over the flame to control the \nrange. This violates the heightened accessibility standards. \n92.  Similarly, several tested units did not provide the space or features necessary for \nwheelchair users to use bathroom features comfortably and safely. The inability to access and \n  24 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 25 of 44 PageID #:25\nuse a bathroom creates obvious obstacles for residents, potential residents, or guests with \ndisabilities. \na.  Several tested bathrooms did not have a 60-inch turning radius in the \nbathroom, such that an individual who uses a wheelchair could \ncomfortably maneuver from feature to feature. This violates the \nheightened accessibility standards. \nb.  In multiple tested bathrooms, an individual using a wheelchair could not \naccess the bathroom sink by a forward approach because there were \ncabinets blocking access. In those bathrooms, the under-sink cabinets were \nnot constructed to be easily removable. This violates both the heightened \nand basic accessibility standards. \nc.  Sinks, showers, and tubs in bathrooms lacked lever hardware, which is \nnecessary for individuals who have difficulty gripping or maneuvering \nwith their hands. This violates the heightened accessibility standards. \nd.  Fourteen of the seventeen tested developments did not have a roll-in \nshower in their designated “accessible” unit. Roll-in showers allow an \nindividual who uses a wheelchair to shower independently in his or her \nwheelchair without having to transfer to a separate seat. This violates the \nheightened accessibility standards. \n93.  In multiple tested units, light switches and thermostats were located higher than \n48 inches off the ground. Individuals with limited reach range cannot live in those units without \nsacrificing the ability to control the light and the temperature. This violates both the heightened \nand basic accessibility standards. \n  25 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 26 of 44 PageID #:26\n94.  Several tested developments provided parking for residents, but lacked designated \naccessible parking spaces. This failure diminishes accessibility for people with disabilities who \ndrive, whether they are residents, potential residents, or guests, and violates both the heightened \nand basic accessibility standards. \n95.   Several tested developments did not have a van-accessible parking space, which \nhas a wider access aisle than a standard accessible parking space in order to accommodate a \nwheelchair lift. This violates the heightened accessibility standards. \n96.  One of the tested developments was built in 2017. At this development, the units \ndescribed by the management as “highly accessible” did not include the necessary shower seat or \nchair required by the heightened accessibility standards. In a unit not designated as “highly \naccessible,” an individual using a wheelchair could not access the bathroom sink or the kitchen \nsink by a forward approach because there were cabinets blocking access. In those bathrooms, the \nunder-sink cabinets were not constructed to be easily removable. The tested units at this \ndevelopment did not comply with either the heightened or basic accessibility standards. \n97.  In addition to its failure to comply with accessibility requirements for the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program as a whole, Access Living’s investigation also establishes \nthat the City failed to ensure compliance with accessibility requirements when the City provided \nfederal funding directly to the developer and/or owner of the project. At least eight of the \ninvestigated developments had direct federal funding but did not satisfy either the heightened or \nbasic accessibility standards. \n98.  The City’s unlawful development practices have been in place for decades, and \ncontinue into the present. \n  26 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 27 of 44 PageID #:27\n99.  Access Living’s testing and investigation demonstrate a uniform failure of the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program over several decades to comply with federal accessibility \nstandards in its developments.  \nB.  The City Has No Policies and Procedures to Ensure Architectural \nAccessibility in the Affordable Rental Housing Program \n100.  In addition, Access Living’s investigation revealed that from 1988 to the present, \nthe City failed, and continues to fail, to have policies and procedures to ensure that housing units \nand common areas of developments within the Affordable Rental Housing Program are designed \nand constructed consistent with federal architectural accessibility standards, including UFAS, \nADAAG, and the FHA Accessibility Requirements.  \n101.  Although the City’s Consolidated Plan identifies several programs that provide \nsupport services for people with disabilities, and acknowledges the large gap between supply and \ndemand for accessible, affordable housing, it does not identify any specific program or policy \nthat ensures affordable housing units are designed, constructed, and maintained to meet UFAS \nand other applicable federal accessibility standards.  \n102.  Prior to making funding commitments, the City Funding Agencies do not review \narchitectural plans to ensure compliance with the accessibility requirements of the ADA, Section \n504, or the FHA. \n103.  The City Funding Agencies do not conduct field visits during construction to \nensure that developments in the Affordable Rental Housing Program are actually built or \nrenovated in compliance with the heightened accessibility requirements of the ADA and Section \n504 or the basic accessibility requirements of the FHA.  \n104.  The City Funding Agencies do not have their own process for issuing construction \npermits, conducting building inspections, or issuing occupancy permits for developments in the \n  27 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 28 of 44 PageID #:28\nAffordable Rental Housing Program. Rather, the City funding agencies rely on the permitting \nand inspection process administered by the City’s Department of Buildings. \n105.  Access Living’s investigation reveals that the Department of Building’s process \nfor issuing construction and occupancy permits does not ensure developments in the Affordable \nRental Housing Program are built in accord with the heightened accessibility requirements of the \nADA and Section 504 or the basic accessibility requirements of the FHA. \n106.  The City, through its Department of Buildings, reviews plans and buildings in \nconstruction to ensure that certain provisions of the Chicago Building Code applicable to new \nand rehabilitated residential buildings are enforced, including requirements related to structure, \nfire safety, light and ventilation, and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems. However, the \nCity does not ensure that the accessibility provisions of the Chicago Building Code are enforced, \nincluding for properties in the Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n107.  The City and DPD know or should know that the Department of Buildings’ \nstandard process will not result in developments that comply either with the heightened \naccessibility requirements of the ADA and Section 504 or the basic accessibility requirements of \nthe FHA. In part, they should know this because Access Living and other disability advocates \nhave long complained to the City about the ongoing lack of accessible, affordable housing \nthroughout the City. Access Living and other individuals and entities have also filed a number of \ncases over the last several decades alleging that new construction in the City of Chicago was not \nbeing built according to federal accessibility law.  \n108.  The City’s failures with regard to ensuring the accessibility of the Affordable \nRental Housing Program stand in stark contrast to its efforts to enforce other requirements, such \n  28 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 29 of 44 PageID #:29\nas regulatory provisions concerning affordability requirements, deck and porch requirements, \nfencing requirements, and the City’s weed control ordinance.  \n109.  The City has also failed to ensure that third-party developers and owners comply \nwith the heightened accessibility requirements of the ADA and Section 504 or the basic \naccessibility requirements of the FHA. \n110.  As a result of the City’s failure to enforce compliance with the heightened \naccessibility requirements, the Affordable Rental Housing Program lacks thousands of units with \naccessible features that would have existed had the City taken adequate steps to ensure \ncompliance with the heightened accessibility requirements of the ADA and Section 504. \n111.  Similarly, the Affordable Rental Housing Program lacks thousands of units that \ncomply with the basic accessibility requirements of the FHA, due to the City’s failures. \n112.  As a result of the City’s failure to enforce such compliance, hundreds or perhaps \nthousands of Chicagoans with disabilities, including those described in paragraph 3, have been \nforced to live on the street, in their cars, in nursing homes, in homeless shelters, or in other \ninadequate and dangerous housing. \nC.  The City Has Failed to Ensure Individuals Who Need Accessible Features \nHave Access To, and Are Being Placed In, Accessible Units \n113.  The City also failed to take steps to ensure accessible units within the Affordable \nRental Housing Program are made available to people with disabilities who need them.  \n114.  During its investigation, Access Living requested all documents from DPD \nreflecting the number, location, and availability of apartment units that received federal financial \nassistance and complied with the UFAS requirements. DPD confirmed it does not possess or \nmaintain a list that summarizes and contains that information for more than a small subset of the \nAffordable Rental Housing Program. Thus, at all relevant times, the City could not or would not \n  29 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 30 of 44 PageID #:30\nidentify for the public which buildings or units in the Affordable Rental Housing Program \nreceived federal financial assistance. \n115.  At all relevant times, the City could not or would not identify for the public any \nwheelchair-accessible or sensory-accessible units in the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n116.  At all relevant times, the City could not or would not describe for the public any \naccessible features in so-called “wheelchair units,” “handicapped units,” or “sensory accessible \nunits” within the Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n117.  Because the City has not compiled and tracked information regarding the location \nof accessible units in its Affordable Rental Housing Program, it has failed and continues to fail to \nrespond to requests from members of the public concerning the location of any accessible units \nthat do exist.  \n118.  The City has also failed, and continues to fail, to notify people with disabilities of \nthe existence and availability of any accessible units that do exist, or to provide a method for \napplying for those units.  \n119.  The City’s failure to track and publicize the existence and availability of units \nwith accessible features makes it extremely difficult for individuals with mobility and sensory \ndisabilities who need accessible features to find the few units where they might live comfortably. \n120.  The City has also failed, and continues to fail, to take steps to ensure that \naccessible units that do exist in the Affordable Rental Housing Program are indeed inhabited by \npeople with disabilities who need those accessible features. When people who do not need \naccessible features reside in accessible units, it diminishes the housing opportunities of those \nwho need a unit with such features. \n  30 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 31 of 44 PageID #:31\n121.  In addition, to the extent the City includes provisions in its loan and regulatory \nagreements with developers, owners, operators, and managers of Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram developments that mandate compliance with accessibility requirements, the City does \nnot enforce such requirements and does not seek to recover funds if those requirements are \nbreached.  \nD.  The City Has Not Completed a Comprehensive Self-Evaluation \n122.  Neither the City nor DPD has conducted a self-evaluation in accord with the \nrequirements of the ADA, 28 C.F.R. § 35.105, and Section 504, 24 C.F.R. § 8.51, that assessed \nthe accessibility of the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n123.  In its annual budget statement presented in October 2015, MOPD reported that \n“as part of the City’s Title II Self-Evaluation Program, [MOPD] conducted self-evaluation \nsurveys of all City facilities and programs,” but provided no information on findings of \ninaccessibility in the Affordable Rental Housing Program. Nor did it reference any transition \nplan to overcome accessibility barriers within the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n124.  MOPD’s October 2016 and October 2017 Budget Statements make no mention at \nall of a self-evaluation or a transition plan for the Affordable Rental Housing Program. \n125.  While the City posts a Notice of Nondiscrimination on its website, identifying the \nCommissioner of MOPD as the City-wide ADA Coordinator, the City displays no ADA or \nSection 504 self-evaluation or transition plan for DPD or any other agency on any publicly-\navailable website. \n126.  To the extent the City is engaging in the kind of accessibility self-evaluation \nrequired by federal law, there is no evidence that it has identified or has decided to address the \nchronic shortage of accessible, affordable housing in its Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n*  *  *  \n  31 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 32 of 44 PageID #:32\n127.  The City failed, and continues to fail, to ensure that housing within the Affordable \nRental Housing Program complies with applicable federal law and is accessible to people with \ndisabilities. As a result, people with physical disabilities who require accessible units are denied \nmeaningful access to the Affordable Rental Housing Program.  \n128.  The City has also failed, and continues to fail, to ensure the affordable housing \nunits within the Affordable Rental Housing Program are made equally available to people with \ndisabilities and that the Affordable Rental Housing Program’s services and facilities are equally \navailable to people with disabilities.  \nINJURY TO PLAINTIFF ACCESS LIVING \n129.  Access Living is a cross-disability organization governed and staffed primarily by \npeople with disabilities. Access Living fosters the dignity, pride, and self-esteem of people with \ndisabilities and enhances the options available to them so they may choose and maintain \nindividualized and satisfying lifestyles. To this end, Access Living offers:  peer-oriented \nindependent living services; public education, awareness, and development; individualized and \nsystemic advocacy; and enforcement of civil rights on behalf of people with disabilities. Access \nLiving recognizes the innate rights, abilities, needs, and diversity of people with disabilities, \nworks toward their full integration into community life, and serves as an agent of social change.  \n130.  As a result of the actions described above, Access Living and its consumers, \nemployees, and board of directors (“constituents”) have been directly and substantially injured. \nThese actions have frustrated Access Living’s mission and undermined the effectiveness of the \nprograms and services it provides, including its efforts to:  move people out of institutional \nsettings and into housing in the community; encourage community integration of people with \ndisabilities; provide assistance to individuals and families searching for housing or affected by \ndiscriminatory housing practices; and eliminate discriminatory housing practices.  \n  32 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 33 of 44 PageID #:33\n131.  A substantial majority of Access Living’s consumers are people with disabilities \nor family members of people with disabilities who have been harmed and continue to be harmed \ndue to the City’s failure to ensure that the Affordable Rental Housing Program is accessible to \npeople with disabilities.  \n132.  Because the City has not complied with its obligations to ensure that its \nAffordable Rental Housing Program meets accessibility requirements, and because it has failed \nto inform the public of the existence of any accessible units, Access Living has been required to \ndevote substantial staff time and money to assist people with disabilities to locate and secure \nsuch accessible housing. \n133.  As a consequence of the violations by the City described herein, Access Living \nhas had to divert its scarce resources away from its educational and other programs focused on \nexpanding independent living options for its constituents and toward efforts focused on securing \ncompliance with federal accessibility requirements in the City’s Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram. \n134.  For example, Access Living attempts to facilitate and encourage independent \nliving through its community reintegration work. Access Living’s community reintegration \nservices help people with disabilities transition from nursing homes into communities of their \nchoice, because it is well-established that a person’s quality of life improves when integrated into \nthe community. The reintegration process is comprehensive and involves:  referral from a \nmanaged care organization; identifying the consumer’s housing and independent living needs; \nthe location and viewing of housing units; completing housing subsidy and lease paperwork; \nidentifying and purchasing needed household and grocery items; moving into the unit; and \nconnecting the client with wrap-around services and benefits. Access Living also offers \n  33 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 34 of 44 PageID #:34\nindependent living skills training, including financial literacy classes, so individuals are \nsuccessful in their new homes. One of the primary barriers to moving people with disabilities \nfrom institutions into the community is the lack of accessible, affordable housing. Due to the \nshortage of such housing in the Chicago area, people who could be moved into the community \nthrough Access Living’s community reintegration services continue to languish in nursing \nfacilities and require additional time and effort from Access Living staff who work on their \nbehalf. \n135.  Since 2004, Access Living has received over 50,000 telephone inquiries from \nconsumers seeking affordable and/or accessible housing. As a result, Access Living has \nexpended substantial resources attempting to counteract the City’s discriminatory practices \nincluding, but not limited to, counseling people with disabilities affected by the City’s \ndiscriminatory practices and conducting outreach to the City about federal accessibility \nrequirements, resulting in the diversion of resources that it would not have had to expend were it \nnot for the City’s violations.  \n136.  In addition, Access Living has invested considerable time and effort to educate \nthe City, the housing industry, and the general public about the importance of accessible housing \nfor people with disabilities in an attempt to secure compliance. Over the last several years, \nAccess Living staff has engaged in systemic advocacy efforts around accessible, affordable \nhousing, including but not limited to: meeting with City officials, submitting comments to the \nCity’s Consolidated Plan and Five-Year Housing Plan, testifying at public hearings, and working \nwith its constituents to convey individual accounts of their inability to find accessible, affordable \nhousing directly to City officials, including the Mayor.  \n  34 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 35 of 44 PageID #:35\n137.  The City’s continuing discriminatory practices have also forced Access Living to \ndivert scarce resources to identify, investigate, and counteract the City’s discriminatory practices, \nand such practices have frustrated Access Living’s other efforts against discrimination, causing \nAccess Living to suffer concrete and demonstrable injuries. As detailed above, Access Living \nconducted site visits, investigations, surveys, and tests at properties throughout the Affordable \nRental Housing Program in order to assess the extent of the City’s discrimination, which resulted \nin the diversion of its resources in terms of staff time, travel, and incidental expenses that Access \nLiving would not have had to expend were it not for the City’s violations. \n138.  Each time the City failed to ensure that housing in the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram was accessible, it frustrated the mission of Access Living inasmuch as it made it \ndifficult or impossible for people with disabilities to live in that housing, and difficult or \nimpossible for Access Living to deliver federally-mandated services to Chicagoans with \ndisabilities. \n139.  Going forward, to counteract this frustration of mission, Access Living will be \nrequired to carry out a comprehensive program of monitoring, training, public education and \noutreach, and counseling for people with disabilities seeking accessible housing. \n140.  Until remedied, the City’s unlawful, discriminatory actions will continue to injure \nAccess Living by: \na.  interfering with efforts and programs intended to bring about equality of \nopportunity in housing; \nb.  requiring the commitment of scarce resources, including substantial staff \ntime and funding, to investigate and counteract the City’s discriminatory \n  35 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 36 of 44 PageID #:36\nconduct, thus diverting those resources from Access Living’s other \nactivities and services, such as education, outreach, and counseling;  \nc.  continuing to frustrate the mission and purposes of Access Living; and  \nd.  conveying to people with disabilities and to the public at large that Access \nLiving is ineffective in addressing the needs of the disability community \nin Chicago and fulfilling its federal mandate.  \n141.  By the actions described above, the City has engaged and continues to engage in \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities in violation of the ADA, Section 504, and the \nFair Housing Act. The City’s discriminatory conduct over the last several decades constitutes a \ncontinuing violation. \n142.  The City has acted or failed to act with deliberate indifference. The City has \nknown that its acts and omissions create a substantial likelihood of harm to Access Living’s \nfederally protected rights, and the City failed to prevent that likelihood. \n143.  There now exists an actual controversy between the parties regarding the City’s \nduties under federal civil rights laws. Access Living accordingly is entitled to declaratory relief. \n144.  Unless enjoined, the City will continue to engage in the unlawful acts and the \npattern or practice of discrimination and unlawful conduct described above. \n145.  Access Living has no adequate remedy at law. It is now suffering and will \ncontinue to suffer irreparable injury from the City’s acts and unlawful conduct unless relief is \nprovided by this Court. Access Living is thus entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief. \n  36 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 37 of 44 PageID #:37\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount I – Violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. \n \n146.  Access Living re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the foregoing paragraphs. \n147.  The City, a public entity, discriminated and continues to discriminate on the basis \nof disability in violation of Title II of the ADA by acting or failing to act in a manner that, \namong other things:  \na.  denies meaningful access to the Affordable Rental Housing Program to \npeople with mobility, visual, and hearing disabilities;  \nb.  aids or perpetuates discrimination against people with disabilities, \nincluding the construction of new facilities used for public purposes that \nare not accessible, when such discriminatory conduct is engaged in by \ndevelopers and others who have received financial or other significant \nassistance from the City as part of the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram;  \nc.  uses methods of administration that discriminate against people with \ndisabilities, defeating the purpose of the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram, and/or that perpetuate the discrimination of other agencies by \nfailing to ensure that the Affordable Rental Housing Program provides \naccessible housing or otherwise provides meaningful access to people with \nmobility, visual, or hearing disabilities; and \n  37 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 38 of 44 PageID #:38\nd.  otherwise limits people with disabilities from enjoying housing or the \nopportunity to obtain such housing by engaging in the policies, practices, \nacts, and omissions described above. \n148.  As a result of the discrimination alleged in the previous paragraphs, Access \nLiving has sustained the injuries described herein. \nCount II – Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \n29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n \n149.  Access Living re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the foregoing paragraphs. \n150.  As a recipient of federal financial assistance, the City discriminated and continues \nto discriminate on the basis of disability in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by \nacting or failing to act in a manner that, among other things:  \na.  denies meaningful access to the Affordable Rental Housing Program to \npeople with mobility, visual, and hearing disabilities;  \nb.  aids or perpetuates discrimination against people with disabilities, \nincluding the construction of inaccessible facilities with federal housing \nfunds and/or for other public purposes, when such discriminatory conduct \nis engaged in by developers and others who have received financial or \nother significant assistance from the City as part of the Affordable Rental \nHousing Program;  \nc.  uses methods of administration that discriminate against people with \ndisabilities, defeating the purpose of the Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram, and/or that perpetuate the discrimination of other agencies by \n  38 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 39 of 44 PageID #:39\nfailing to ensure that the redevelopment housing provides meaningful \naccess to people with mobility, visual, or hearing disabilities; and \nd.  otherwise limits people with disabilities from enjoying housing or the \nopportunity to obtain such housing by engaging in the policies, practices, \nacts, and omissions described above. \n151.  As a result of the discrimination alleged in the previous paragraphs, Access \nLiving has sustained the injuries described herein. \nCount III – Violation of the Fair Housing Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \n152.  Access Living re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the foregoing paragraphs. \n153.  Access Living is an aggrieved person as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i).  \n154.  The Affordable Rental Housing Program contains residential apartment units that \nare “dwelling[s]” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). \n155.  As described above, the City has committed discriminatory housing practices that \nmade such dwellings unavailable to persons because of their disabilities in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(1). \n156.  The City has also discriminated against persons because of their disabilities in the \nterms, conditions, or privileges of rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities \nin connection with the rental of a dwelling, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2).  \n157.  The Affordable Rental Housing Program also contains residential multi-family \ndevelopments with four or more units built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 (“covered \nunits”), subject to the design and construction requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)(3)(C) of the Fair Housing Act.  \n  39 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 40 of 44 PageID #:40\n158.  The City, as a developer of numerous properties subject to the Fair Housing \nAccessibility Requirements, has failed to design and construct those developments in compliance \nwith the requirements mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C) and the applicable regulation, 24 \nC.F.R. § 100.205 (2008), including, inter alia, failing to design and construct those \ndevelopments such that: \na.  the public-use and common-use portions are readily accessible to and \nusable by people with disabilities;  \nb.  doors designed to allow passage into and within covered units are \nsufficiently wide to allow passage by a person who uses a wheelchair; \nc.  covered units contain an accessible route into and through the dwelling;  \nd.  light switches and thermostats in covered units are in accessible locations; \nand \ne.  covered units contain usable kitchens and bathrooms such that a person \nwho uses a wheelchair can maneuver about the space.  \n159.  The City’s differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in the Affordable \nRental Housing Program is consistent and continuous throughout the last several decades. \nWhether analyzed on a year-to-year basis or over the entire period of investigation, the same \npattern of differential treatment is evident and constitutes a continuing violation of the Fair \nHousing Act.  \n160.  As a result of the discrimination alleged in the previous paragraphs, Access \nLiving has sustained the injuries described herein. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Access Living respectfully prays that this Court enter an order \nagainst the City of Chicago, as follows: \n  40 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/13/18 Page 41 of 44 PageID #:41\n161.

Chicago is a recipient of federal financial assistance from the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subject to Section 504 and a public \nentity subject to Title II.2 \nAccess Living of Metropolitan Chicago, Inc. brought this action against Chicago under \nSection 504, Title II, and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-19, alleging the City \ndiscriminates against individuals with disabilities by failing to ensure its “affordable rental \nhousing program” is accessible.  Compl., Dkt. 1.  Access Living uses the term “affordable rental \nhousing program” to describe “the City’s efforts to develop and support affordable housing using \nfederal, state, and local funding—which has resulted in the construction or rehabilitation \nof…more than 50,000 rental units.”  Compl. ¶2.  Chicago moved for summary judgment, \narguing, in part, that it does not operate an “affordable rental housing program” and therefore \nTitle II and Section 504 do not apply.  See Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. For Summ. J. (“City \nMem.”), Dkt. 208 at 5-13.  Chicago also argues that Section 504 and Title II do not apply to non-\nfederally funded developments.3 \n \n1 The Attorney General is authorized “to attend to the interests of the United States” in any case pending \nin federal court.  28 U.S.C. § 517. \n2 This Statement of Interest uses the term “public entity” to refer to both a recipient of federal financial \nassistance under Section 504 and a public entity under Title II when discussing both statutes, for brevity. \n3 This Statement of Interest only addresses the Section 504 and Title II claims. \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:7693\n \nThis Statement of Interest clarifies the correct interpretation of whether Chicago’s \naffordable housing activities constitute a covered service, program, or activity under Section 504 \nand Title II, the benefits of which must be accessible to individuals with disabilities.  First, it \nexplains that Section 504 and Title II cover all programs or activities of a public entity, and the \nlaw and undisputed facts support that providing affordable rental housing opportunities is a \nprogram or activity of the City.  Second, Section 504 and Title II govern a public entity whether \nit provides a benefit directly or through contractual or other arrangements.  Thus, Chicago is \nliable for the accessibility of its program or activity even when it contracts with private \ndevelopers to build the affordable housing.  Third, Chicago has the authority, obligation, and \nability to ensure the private developers it contracts with provide housing that is both affordable \nand accessible.  Fourth, Section 504 obligations extend to the entire “program or activity” of a \nrecipient of federal funding. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nThis litigation implicates the proper interpretation and application of Section 504 and \nTitle II.  The Department of Justice is charged with enforcing Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), \nand with coordinating federal agencies’ implementation and enforcement of Section 504, 28 \nC.F.R. pt. 41; Exec. Order No. 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, 1980); see also 28 C.F.R. \n§ 0.51(b)(3).  Congress delegated authority to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) to promulgate regulations under Section 504, and HUD implements and \nensures Section 504 compliance.  29 U.S.C. § 794; 24 C.F.R. pt. 8. \nCongress charged the Department of Justice with implementing Title II of the ADA by \npromulgating regulations, issuing technical assistance, and bringing suits in federal court to \nenforce the statute.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12133-12134, 12206; 28 C.F.R. pt. 35.  HUD is the designated \n2 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:7694\n \nagency responsible for implementing the compliance procedures under Title II at 28 C.F.R. pt. \n35, Subpart F, for purposes of all programs, services, and activities relating to state and local \npublic housing, and housing assistance and referral.  28 C.F.R. § 35.190(b)(4). \nThe United States therefore has a strong interest in the proper and uniform application of \nSection 504 and Title II, and in furthering Congress’s intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, \nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities” and reserve \na “central role” for the federal government in enforcing the ADA’s standards.  42 \nU.S.C.§ 12101(b)(2)-(3). \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  Legal Background \nA.  Section 504 \nCongress enacted Section 504 in 1973 to guarantee that no otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability in the United States, shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 24 C.F.R. \n§§ 8.1(a), 8.2, 8.4(a).  A central aim of Section 504 was the “elimination of architectural \nbarriers.”  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 297 (1985) (citing S. Rep. No. 93-318, p. 4 \n(1973)). \nThe City is a primary recipient of federal financial assistance from HUD subject to \nSection 504.  24 C.F.R. §§ 8.2, 8.3.  A “primary recipient” includes a “State or local unit of \ngovernment that is authorized or required to extend Federal financial assistance to another \nrecipient for the purpose of carrying out a program or activity.”  24 C.F.R. § 8.3.  Section 504 \ndefines “program or activity” as “all of the operations of…a local government; or the entity of \nsuch…local government that distributes such assistance….  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. \n3 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:7695\n \n§ 8.3.  Under Section 504, individuals with disabilities “must be provided with meaningful \naccess to the benefit that the grantee offers.”  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 301.  A recipient, \nin providing the benefits of a program that receives federal financial assistance may not, directly \nor through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, discriminate against individuals with \ndisabilities.  24 C.F.R. § 8.4(b)(1). \nB.  Title II of the ADA \nIn 1990, Congress enacted the ADA, expanding protections to individuals with \ndisabilities by providing “a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  Congress found \nthat “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persist in such critical areas \nas…housing…and access to public services” and “individuals with disabilities continually \nencounter various forms of discrimination, including…the discriminatory effects of \narchitectural…barriers.  Id. § 12101(a)(3), (5).  Title II of the ADA applies to public entities and \nprovides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of \na public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  Id. § 12132. \nThe City is a public entity subject to Title II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(B); 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.104.  At its core, the ADA requires that individuals with disabilities be provided with \n“equality of opportunity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii).  Equality \nof opportunity means the City must provide individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in and benefit from any aid or benefit provided to others.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(1).  The Title II regulation makes clear that Title II applies to programs “made \navailable” by a public entity and that when providing an aid or benefit, the public entity “may not, \n4 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:7696\n \ndirectly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements” discriminate on the basis of \ndisability.  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.102(a), 35.130(b)(1). \nC.  Program Accessibility Under Section 504 and Title II \nBoth Section 504 and Title II regulations require that a public entity operate each \nprogram or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.  24 C.F.R. §§ 8.20, 8.24 (Section 504); \n28 C.F.R. §§ 35.149, 35.150 (Title II).  And both the Section 504 and Title II regulations contain \nphysical accessibility requirements for facilities.  24 C.F.R. §§ 8.20, 8.22, 8.23, 8.24, 8.32 \n(Section 504); 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.149, 35.150, 35.151 (Title II). \nII.  Factual Background \nOne self-described mission of the City is to develop and administer programs and \npolicies to encourage and promote the availability of adequate and affordable housing in the \nCity.4  As part of this mission, the City helps to build, rehabilitate, and preserve rental housing to \nensure that it is available to residents throughout Chicago.5  To accomplish its mission, the \nChicago Department of Housing (“DOH”) is tasked to work with private developers to increase \nthe supply of affordable housing in every Chicago neighborhood through a litany of targeted \n \n4 Municipal Code of Chicago, 2-44-050(a)(1), available at \nhttps://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2598874 (last visited Dec. 11, \n2023); see also Chicago Department of Housing, Housing, DOH – Mission, \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/auto_generated/doh_mission.html (last visited Dec. 11, 2023). \n5 See Chicago Department of Housing, Affordable Rental Housing Resource List, \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/renters/svcs/affordable-rental-housing-resource-\nlist.html (last visited Dec. 11, 2023); see also City Ex. 8 at 2. \n5 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:7697\n \nprograms.6  One of Chicago’s “affordable housing programs” includes the Multi-Family Housing \nFinancial Assistance Program.7 \nThe City of Chicago is a recipient of $100 million annually, on average, of HUD funds, \nincluding Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and Community Development Block \nGrant (CDBG) funds.8  Since 1988, the City has used this funding, along with other funding \nsources and tax credits, to provide grants and loans to private developers and nonprofits to \nfacilitate the construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing in at least 517 developments.9  \nThe City instructs developers seeking DOH funds or other assistance to rehabilitate, construct, or \nrefinance multi-family affordable rental housing developments to complete a Multi-Family \nHousing Financial Assistance Application (“Application”).10  If a proposed development \nproceeds past the application stage, it will go to City Council for approval.11 \nThe City enters into standardized written agreements with developers when it provides \nfunds or tax credits.12  The contracts require developers to comply with federal, state, and local \nlaws, including Section 504 and the ADA.13  Under the contracts, among other provisions: 1) the \n \n6 Pl.

Chicago’s Affordable Rental Housing Scheme is a Program or Activity of the City \nUnder Section 504 and Title II.17 \nUnder Section 504 and Title II, a program or activity is anything the public entity does, \ncovers all the normal functions of a government entity, and includes those activities that are \ncarried out through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements.  Chicago has committed to \nproviding the benefit of affordable rental housing to its residents as expressed through its \nMunicipal Code, website, and contracts with private developers.  Chicago carries out this \nprogram through various activities, including contracting with private developers to build and \nrehabilitate affordable rental housing for Chicago residents.  And Chicago has the authority, \nobligation, and ability to ensure that the private developers with whom it contracts provide \naffordable housing that is accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Thus, Chicago is liable \n \n14 See City Exs. 8-38. \n15 See, e.g., City Ex. 8, Ex, B (C0266412) (requiring 65 units to be occupied by “low-income families” \nand 28 units by “very-low-income families.”); City Ex. 33 at 2, 5, Ex. B (C0486250, C0486252, \nC0486263) (requiring 30 units to be occupied by “low-income families” at a rent determined by the City). \n16 City SOMF ¶ 34. \n17 Title II of the ADA and Section 504 are construed in a consistent manner.  Ashby v. Warrick Cnty. Sch. \nCorp., 908 F.3d 225, 230 n. 10 (7th Cir. 2018). \n7 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:7699\n \nunder Section 504 and Title II to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to the \nbenefits of its affordable rental housing program.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Section 504), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132 (Title II). \nA.  A “Program” or “Activity” Includes Anything a Public Entity Does and \nProviding Affordable Housing is a Normal Function of City Governments. \nThe statutory phrases “program or activity” and “service, program or activity” are \nintentionally expansive.  Section 504 defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations \nof…a local government; or the entity of such…local government that distributes such \nassistance….  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 8.3.  The same phrase in the ADA, expanded to \ninclude “services” as well, is at least as broad.  See 42 U.S.C. 12201(a) (“Except as otherwise \nprovided in this Act, nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the \nstandards applied under [Section 504] or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to \nsuch title.”).  The Title II regulation specifies that Title II of the ADA “applies to all services, \nprograms, and activities provided or made available by public entities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.102(a) \n(emphasis added), see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1).  The Supreme Court has recognized the \nbreadth of the phrase “benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity,” \nrejecting arguments that it does not apply to state prisons.  Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v. \nYeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210-12 (1998). \nThe Seventh Circuit has recognized that the statutory terms service, program, or activity \nare unambiguously broad, holding “whenever a public entity or federal funding recipient ‘does ... \nanything,’ it must extend ‘the benefits of,’ and cannot ‘discriminat[e]’ in, that thing on the basis \nof disability.”  Ashby v. Warrick Cnty. Sch. Corp., 908 F.3d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted); see e.g. Oconomowoc Residential Programs, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 300 F.3d 775, \n782 (7th Cir. 2002) (zoning decisions covered under Title II); Hason v. Med. Bd., 279 F.3d 1167, \n8 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:7700\n \n1173 (9th Cir. 2002) (medical licensing covered under Title II).  In determining whether something \nis a service, program, or activity under Section 504 and Title II, some courts have focused on \nwhether the function is a “normal function of a government entity.”  See Barden v. City of \nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (maintaining public sidewalks is a normal \ngovernment function); Innovative Health Systems v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 45 (2d Cir. \n1997) (zoning decisions are a normal function of a government entity); Am. Council of the Blind \nof Metro. Chi. v. City of Chi., No. 19 C 6322, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56419, at *15 (N.D. Ill. Mar. \n31, 2023) (maintenance of signalized intersections and the pedestrian grid is a normal function of \na government entity). \nThe City’s own municipal code makes clear that one function of the city is to “develop \nand administer programs and policies to encourage and promote the availability of adequate and \naffordable housing in the City.”  Municipal Code of Chicago, 2-44-050(a)(1); see Ellison v. \nUnited States Postal Serv., 84 F.4th 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2023) (using the statute establishing the \nPostal Service to define the contours of the program at issue).  On its website, Chicago states that \nthe “mission of [DOH] is to expand access and choice for residents and protect their right to \nquality homes that are affordable, safe, and healthy.”  See Chicago Department of Housing, \nHousing, DOH – Mission, \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/auto_generated/doh_mission.html (last visited Dec. \n11, 2023).  Chicago’s website also states that it “works to develop and support affordable \nhousing initiatives citywide” and that “the City helps to build, rehabilitate and preserve rental \nhousing to ensure that it is available to residents throughout Chicago.”  See Chicago Department \nof Housing, Affordable Rental Housing Resource List, \n9 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:7701\n \nhttps://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/renters/svcs/affordable-rental-housing-\nresource-list.html (last visited Dec. 11, 2023). \nChicago also affirms in its contracts with private developers that developing and \nsupporting affordable housing is a City function.  One agreement with a private developer, for \nexample, states that the City has received funding from HUD “to increase the number of families \nserved with decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing and to expand the long-term supply of \naffordable housing, through, among other things, acquisitions, new construction, reconstruction \nand rehabilitation.” See City Ex. 8 at 2.  The agreement requires, among other things, that at least \n28 of the units in the “Low-Income Project” shall be occupied by “Very-Low Income Families.”  \nSee City Ex. 8 at Exs. A, B.  In another agreement, the City states that pursuant to the Municipal \nCode of Chicago, it “supervises and coordinates the formulation and execution of projects and \nprograms creating safe, decent and affordable housing for residents of the City.” See City Ex. 33 \nat 2.  The agreement requires, among other things, that all of the units in the “Low-Income \nProject” (as defined by the contract) shall be leased only to tenants who are Low-Income \nFamilies at the time of initial occupancy by such Low-Income Families.  Id. at 5.  Chicago, like \nmany cities, develops affordable housing as a normal function of city government.  Thus, this \nconstitutes a program or activity covered under Section 504 and Title II. \nB.  Chicago Cannot Contract Away Its Section 504 and Title II Obligations. \nSection 504 and Title II cover all programs and activities of a public entity, and do not \ndistinguish between a program provided directly by the public entity and a program provided \nthrough a contractual or other arrangement.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (Section 504), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132 (Title II).  The regulations make clear that when a city’s program is carried out through \n“contractual, licensing, or other arrangements,” the city maintains its Section 504 and Title II \nobligations.  24 C.F.R. § 8.4(b)(iii), (viii) (Section 504); 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.102(a), 35.130(b)(1) \n10 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:7702\n \n(Title II); City Mem. at 7 (acknowledging that it cannot avoid its obligations by “ceding its \ngovernmental functions to private entities”).18  For example, in Castle v. Eurofresh, Inc., Arizona \ncontracted with a private company to provide a work incentive program to Arizona state inmates, \nand the inmate alleged that the private company discriminated against him because of his \ndisability.  731 F.3d 901, 909-10 (9th Cir. 2013).  The Ninth Circuit determined the work \nincentive program was a benefit provided to the inmate by the State, and not the private \ncompany, and that the State was liable to ensure compliance with Title II.  Id.; see also \nArmstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1066 (9th Cir. 2010) (state maintained its Title II \nobligations to state inmates who were housed in county jails through arrangements between the \nState and County); Marks v. Colorado Department of Corrections, 976 F.3d 1087, 1098 (10th \nCir. 2020) (public entities can “farm out operations to others, but doing so would not prevent \nliability under [Section 504 or Title II]”). \nHere, Chicago contracts with private developers to build and rehabilitate affordable rental \nhousing for Chicago residents.19  In its contracts with developers, Chicago requires them to \ncomply with Section 504 and ADA. See e.g. City Ex. 8 § 2.27 (requiring Section 504 and ADA \ncompliance when City provides funding from a federal source); City SOMF ¶ 17, City Ex. 34 § \n6.01(a) (requiring Section 504 and ADA compliance when providing city funding).  This helps to \nensure that Chicago complies with its own legal obligations.  See City of LA v. AECOM Servs., \n854 F.3d 1149, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[A]n important component in a city’s doing all it can \n \n18 HUD’s Section 504 regulation further requires subrecipients of federal financial assistance to submit an \nassurance to the primary recipient of federal financial assistance that it will comply with the requirements \nof HUD’s Section 504 regulation.  24 C.F.R. § 8.50(a). \n19 While the City relies heavily on Ashby v. Warrick Cnty. Sch. Corp., 908 F.3d 225 (7th Cir. 2018), the \ncase has limited value for the instant case because it did not involve a contractual relationship between a \npublic and private entity.  Instead, the case addressed a scenario where a school choir was an invitee to a \nprivate event. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:7703\n \nto fulfill its duties under Title II and § 504 is to require as part of its contracts with necessary \nthird party entities that the requirements of those statutes be met.”). \nDespite including these requirements in its contracts, Chicago argues that it is not liable \nfor the lack of accessibility in affordable housing built by the private developers because “the \nexistence of a contractual relationship does not per se create a program.”  City Mem. at 11.  In \ndoing so, Chicago misconstrues the Department of Justice’s Title II Technical Assistance \nManual 1994 Supplement by omitting the complete guidance and further illustrations that \nsupport Chicago’s liability.  City Mem. at 11.  For example, the manual explains that: \nif a State highway authority leases a facility in one of its highway rest areas to a \nprivately owned restaurant, the public entity would be responsible for making the \nspace accessible, because the restaurant is part of the State’s program of providing \nservices to the motoring public. The private entity operating the restaurant would \nhave an independent obligation to meet the requirements of title III. 20 \n \nAdditional examples in the guidance illustrate that a public entity is liable for ensuring \naccessibility in the part of its program carried out by contract with private entities, such as a \nprivate restaurant operating by concession in a state park or a privately operated group home \nunder contract with a state agency.  See Section II-1.3000 of the Department’s Title II Technical \nAssistance Manual.21  As in these examples, Chicago’s obligations under Section 504 and Title II \nare established not simply because of a contractual relationship with the developers.  Rather, \nChicago has obligations under these laws with respect to its affordable housing program, one of \nthe normal functions of DOH, even when units are built by private developers with whom the \nCity contracts. \n \n20 Americans with Disabilities Act, Title II Technical Assistance Manual 1994 Supplement at II-5.1000, \navailable at https://archive.ada.gov/taman2up.html (last viewed Dec. 11, 2023). \n21 The Americans with Disabilities Act, Title II Technical Assistance Manual, available at \nhttps://archive.ada.gov/taman2.html (last viewed Dec. 11, 2023). \n12 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:7704\n \nC.  Chicago Has the Ability and Obligation to Ensure That Private Developers \nProvide Affordable and Accessible Rental Housing. \nChicago has the ability and obligation to ensure that the private developers with whom it \ncontracts provide housing that is both affordable and accessible to individuals with disabilities.  \nFirst, as discussed above, Chicago’s contracts require the private developers to comply with \nSection 504 and the ADA.  See e.g. City Ex. 8 § 2.27; City Ex. 34 § 6.01(a).  This includes \nrequiring the affordable housing units to remain in compliance with the accessibility \nrequirements of Section 504 after the construction or rehabilitation of the housing.  See City Ex. \n8 § 2.32. \nSecond, Chicago must ensure that the federal funds it receives from HUD for affordable \nhousing are used in compliance not only with Section 504, but also with statutory and regulatory \nobligations with respect to HUD funding programs.  For instance, under the HOME program, \nrecipients are obligated to comply with program requirements and must monitor their \nsubrecipients for such compliance. See 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.219(b)(2)(iii), 92.504(a) (“…The \nparticipating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies, procedures, and systems, \nincluding a system for assessing risk of activities and projects and a system for monitoring \nentities…to ensure that the requirements of this part are met.”); 92.504(c)(2) (subrecipients’ \nagreements “must set forth and require the subrecipient to follow the participating jurisdiction’s \nrequirements…”); 92.504(c)(2)(iv) (subrecipient’s agreement “must require the subrecipient to \ncarry out each activity in compliance with all Federal laws and regulations described in subpart \nH of this part…,” which includes the requirements at 24 C.F.R. § 5.105(a)(1), requiring \ncompliance with nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements under the Fair Housing \nAct, Section 504, and Title II, among others).  This includes conducting inspections of each \nproject, both upon completion to ensure compliance with the HOME property standards at 24 \n13 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 18 of 23 PageID #:7705\n \nC.F.R. § 92.251,22 and periodically during the period of rental housing affordability to ensure \nongoing compliance with the property standards and other requirements.  See 24 C.F.R. \n§ 92.504(d).  Thus, Chicago cannot argue that it is unable or is not obligated to monitor private \ndevelopers, and thus lacks sufficient control over its affordable housing program to meet its own \nSection 504 and Title II obligations. \nChicago makes several unavailing arguments that it lacks operational control and thus \nliability because: 1) it is merely a funding entity; 2) it does not operate the housing units; and 3) \nit merely issues building permits.  But the facts and cases relied on by Chicago fail to support its \nclaims. \nFirst, Chicago relies on Bacon v. City of Richmond, Virginia, 475 F.3d 633 (4th Cir. \n2007) and McDaniel v. Board of Education of City of Chicago, 956 F. Supp. 2d 887 (N.D. Ill. \n2013) to argue that “funding entities” are not liable under Title II.  Second, Chicago cites Swan v. \nBoard of Education of City of Chicago, 956 F. Supp. 2d 913 (N.D. Ill. 2013) and Wright v. Bd. of \nComm'rs of the Capital Area Transit Sys., 551 F. Supp. 3d 607 (M.D. La. 2021) to argue that it \ncannot be liable because it does not operate the housing developments at issue.  But as explained \nbelow, all four cases address situations involving two separate public entities where only the \npublic entity with the legal authority to carry out the program at issue was found liable under \nSection 504 or Title II.  Here, Chicago is the only public entity at issue and has the legal \nauthority to carry out its affordable rental housing program.  Accordingly, these cases support \nthat Chicago is liable for Section 504 and Title II violations in its affordable rental housing \nprogram. \n \n22 Among other things, the HOME property standards at 24 C.F.R. § 92.251 contain accessibility \nrequirements, which obligates recipients and subrecipients to comply with Section 504 and HUD’s \nimplementing regulation, as well as Title II of the ADA and DOJ’s implementing regulation. \n14 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:7706\n \nBacon involved claims against a school board and the City of Richmond for accessibility \nviolations in the schools.  The Court found the school board liable under Title II because it had \nthe statutory authority to make the improvement projects at issue.  Bacon, 475 F.3d at 639.  The \nCity of Richmond, in contrast, had no authority to fix the accessibility violations and thus was \nnot liable, even though it provided capital funding to the school district.  Id.  Without a finding \nthat the City violated the law, the Court could not require the City to fund the remedial order to \ncorrect the school board’s violations.  Id. at 639-40. \nSimilarly in McDaniel, the Court dismissed the City of Chicago from a lawsuit on the \ngrounds of redressability, where the lawsuit challenged a public-school district’s decision to \nclose 53 elementary schools.  The Court found that the school board, not the City, had the \nauthority to close or keep open the schools.  McDaniel, 956 F. Supp. 2d at 895.  Even if the City \nprovided some funding to the school district, the City lacked the statutory authority to carry out \nthe requested injunction—to keep schools open.  Id. at 893-94.  Likewise, Swan and Wright \naddress situations involving two public entities and the Court found that only one of the two \npublic entities had the statutory authority to carry out the program at issue.  In Swan, only the \nschool board had the statutory authority to close schools, Swan, 956 F. Supp. 2d at 92, and in \nWright, only the Capital Area Transit System had the authority to ensure the accessibility of the \nbus stops.  Wright, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 614. \nHere, Chicago is the public entity with authority to provide affordable rental housing to \nits residents.  Chicago solicits and accepts funding from local, state, and federal sources and then \nuses those funds to administer a program to further its mission of providing affordable rental \nhousing for its residents.  Chicago enters into written agreements to allow it to conduct on-site \ninspections and enforce private parties’ compliance with local and federal accessibility laws \n15 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:7707\n \nthroughout the program.  Chicago is the public entity that can ensure that its affordable rental \nhousing program complies with Section 504 and the ADA.  Here, Chicago sits in a position akin \nto that of the school boards in Bacon, McDaniel, and Swan, and the Capital Area Transit System \nin Wright, all of which had the authority to take the actions at issue to comply with Section 504 \nand the ADA, and thus were found to be the proper defendants. \nFinally, Chicago makes a similar mistake by relying on S.G. v. City of Los Angeles, No. \nLA-CV-1709003 JAK (PJWx), 2020 WL 8837146, at *12 (C.D. Cal. 2020) to support its \nargument that it is not liable under Title II and Section 504 because it merely issues building \npermits.  City MOL at 10.  S.G. in fact supports Chicago’s liability.  In S.G., the Court correctly \nheld Title II does not “extend to discrimination in connection with private services, programs or \nactivities that are licensed, certified or permitted by a public entity” but they do extend to \n“discrimination where a public entity has a public service, program or activity that is operated by \na designated private entity that acts on behalf of the public entity.” S.G. at *9.  As applied here, \nChicago is liable under Section 504 and Title II for the affordable housing program carried out \nby private entities. \nII.  Section 504 Obligations Extend to the  Entire “Program” or “Activity” of a \nRecipient of Federal Funding. \nChicago argues that it is not liable under Section 504 for any developments that only \nreceived non-federal funding or tax credits for affordable housing.23  City Mem. at 15.  But \nChicago is incorrect.  Section 504 defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations” of the \nrecipient.  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 8.3; see Schroeder v. Chicago, 927 F.2d 957, 962 \n(7th Cir. 1991) (explaining that Congress expanded the definition of “program or activity” to \n \n23 This argument does not affect the City’s liability under Title II, which does not rely on federal funding. \n16 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:7708\n \ninclude “all the operations” of the entity receiving the federal funding); Koslow v. Pennsylvania, \n302 F.3d 161, 171-72 (3d Cir. 2002) (Section 504 “sweeps ‘all the operations’ of a department or \nagency receiving federal financial assistant under the Act’s coverage” even if “a particular \n‘activity’…might be the state’s only link to federal funds.”).  Thus, because Chicago receives \nfederal funding for its affordable rental housing program, its Section 504 obligations extend to \nall of the operations of that program, and not only to the portions of the program the city funds \nthrough federal sources.  Accordingly, Chicago’s obligation to comply with Section 504 relates \nto its affordable rental housing program as a whole, as well as on a development-by-development \nbasis.24 \nIII.  Title  II  Program  Accessibility  Provisions  Apply  to  Facilities  Constructed  or \nAltered on Behalf of, or For the Use of, Chicago’s Affordable Rental Housing \nProgram.25 \nChicago next attempts to limit its ADA obligations by arguing that it has no Title II \nobligations because the housing developments were not constructed or altered “by the City.”  \nCity Mem. at 17.  But this too narrowly construes the Title II regulation, which requires \naccessibility in facilities (or part of the facility) newly constructed or altered “by, on behalf of, or \nfor the use of a public entity.”  28 C.F.R.§ 35.151(a)(1), (b)(1) (emphasis added).  Here, when \nChicago enters into contracts with private entities to construct or alter a building to be used as \npart of its affordable rental housing program, the affordable rental housing units must be rented \nto low-income tenants at a rate directed by the City—not at market rate—to further the City’s \n \n24 While the City’s administration of the program as a whole must comply with Section 504, how the \narchitectural standards apply may differ for developments that receive federal financial assistance and \ndevelopments that only received non-federal funding or tax credits. \n25 Section 504 also requires recipients and subrecipients to provide program accessibility in any program \nor activity receiving federal financial assistance. \n17 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:7709\n \nmission of providing affordable housing opportunities.  Accordingly, the construction or \nalteration is “on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity.” \nChicago cites several cases that purport to address what constitutes a “facility altered by, \non behalf of, or for the use of a public entity.”  City Mem. at 17.  But they do not support \nChicago’s argument.  Chicago cites to Swan and Wright, addressed above, which analyze which \nof two public entities has the statutory authority to carry out the program at issue.  Neither case \ndescribes what constitutes a facility altered “on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity.”  Nor \nis Lang v. Oregon Shakespeare Festival Ass’n, No. 1:12–cv–01844–CL, 2013 WL 5944184 (D. \nOr. Oct. 31, 2013) instructive.  In Lang, a city leased land to a private entity that operated a year-\nround festival, which the court found was a private event.  Id. at *1.  As such, there were no \nallegations that the private entity altered any facilities on behalf of, or for the use of, the City.  Id. \nat *1-4.  Similarly, Chicago’s reliance on Tyler v. City of Manhattan, 849 F. Supp. 1429 (D. Kan. \n1994) is misplaced.  There, the Court held that a city was not liable for the inaccessibility of \ntaverns and restaurants.  Id. at 1441-42.  But as in Lang, there were no allegations that the \ntaverns and restaurants carried out any program or activity of the public entity or that the taverns \nor restaurants altered any facilities on behalf of, or for the benefit of the City.  As the public \nentity that develops and administers its affordable rental housing program, Chicago is liable \nunder Title II and Section 504 for ensuring that individuals with disabilities have equal access to \nthe benefits of its affordable housing program, even if the buildings were not built or \nrehabilitated directly by the City but instead done so through contractual relationships. \n   \n18 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 317 Filed: 12/12/23 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:7710\n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor these reasons, the United States asks the Court to consider this Statement of Interest \nin this litigation. \nDated: December 12, 2023 \nRespectfully submitted, \nKRISTEN CLARKE  MORRIS PASQUAL \nAssistant Attorney General for  Acting United States Attorney  \nCivil Rights   \n  By: /s/ Patrick Johnson   \nREBECCA B.

The City \nmoves for summary judgment, arguing that its affordable-housing activities do not \nqualify as a program or activity under the laws, so the City cannot be held liable for \nany of the residential buildings’ shortcomings. See R. 307, Def.’s Mot. For the reasons \nexplained below, summary judgment is denied.   \n \n1This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Access Living’s federal claims under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n \n2Citations to the record are “R.” followed by the docket entry number and, if needed, \na page or paragraph number. \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 2 of 20 PageID #:8297\nI. Background \nIn deciding the City’s motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evi-\ndence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Access Living. Matsushita \nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \nSince 1988, the City of Chicago has administered policies encouraging and fa-\ncilitating (or at least trying to do so) the availability of affordable housing within the \ncity limits. R. 309, DSOF ¶ 4; R. 309-1, DSOF Exh. 1. To date, the City has supported \nthe construction and rehabilitation of over 500 residential developments, creating \nmore than 50,000 affordable housing units. R. 313, Pl.’s Resp. to DSOF ¶ 6; R. 313-1, \nPl.’s Resp. to DSOF Exh. 1, Feidt Dep. at 121, 173–74. \nEach year, the City receives on average of $100 million from the United States \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to put towards the City’s goal. \nR. 314-10, PSOF Exh. 37 at 19, 20. Chicago uses these funds, among other financing \nsources, to provide grants and loans to private developers and nonprofit organizations \nfor building, rehabilitating, and preserving the available rental housing in the City. \nDSOF ¶¶ 2, 4, 6, 7; R. 27, Answer ¶¶ 2, 41–43; DSOF Exh. 1. In exchange for funding, \nthe developers agree to provide some apartments at below market rate to tenants \nwho meet certain income requirements. R. 309-8, DSOF Exh. 8 at 32 (PDF page num-\nber); R. 309-33, DSOF Exh. 33 at 2, 5. The Chicago Department of Housing is tasked \nwith administering these funds. PSOF ¶ 3; R. 314-3, PSOF Exh. 30. \n  A developer or non-profit organization seeking Chicago Department of Housing \nfunds  for  an  affordable  housing  project  must  complete  a  Multi-Family  Housing \n2 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 3 of 20 PageID #:8298\nFinancial Assistance Application. PSOF ¶ 6; R. 314-4, PSOF Exh. 31. If the applicant \npasses this initial stage, then the loan proposal goes to the City Council for review \nand approval. DSOF ¶ 33; R. 309-4, Horan Dep. at 134:4–136:2. If the City Council \napproves the application, then the City will enter into standardized written loan and \nregulatory agreements with the developers, memorializing the transaction. DSOF \n¶¶ 8–19, 39; R. 309-8–38, DSOF Exhs. 8–38.  \nThe contracts obligate the City to provide the developer with funds or tax cred-\nits and, in turn, obligate the developer to comply with federal and state laws, includ-\ning Section 504 and Title II of the ADA. See 24 C.F.R. § 92.504(a). The contracting \nparties (that is, the City and the respective developer) agree that the developers must \ndocument compliance with accessibility requirements, and set out remedies for non-\ncompliance. See DSOF Exhs. 8–38; see also 24 C.F.R. § 92.504(c)(2)(iv). At the build-\ning’s completion, the Chicago Housing Department must inform the federal HUD and \nthe public that the building was inspected “and during the period of affordabil-\nity … meets the … § 922.251 Property Standards,” which incorporate federal accessi-\nbility requirements by reference. PSOF ¶ 18; R. 314-2, Horan Dep. at 53:1–12, 58:14–\n59:21. \nDevelopers must also apply for a building permit, issued by the City’s Depart-\nment of Buildings. DSOF ¶ 35; R. 309-5, Ullrich Dep. at 21:7–22:6. During the permit \nprocess, the City’s Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities reviews the building \nplan for compliance with federal, state, and local accessibility laws and standards. \nDSOF ¶¶ 36–37; Ullrich Dep. at 13:18–14:14, 16:1–16:19, 38:16–39:24, 85:24–87:17. \n3 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 4 of 20 PageID #:8299\nAccess Living, an organization devoted to promoting independent living for \nChicagoans with disabilities, alleges that, despite the City’s effort to develop and \nmaintain affordable housing units, most of these units fail to comply with federal \naccessibility laws (as pertinent here, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Fair \nHousing Act). Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3; R. 312, Pl.’s Resp. at 7–9. In effect, the City lacks a \nsufficient supply of accessible, affordable housing units, leaving Chicagoans with cer-\ntain disabilities unable to find affordable housing. Pl.’s Resp. at 7–9. Access Living \nattributes this failure in part to the City neglecting to consistently review building \npermits for compliance with accessibility standards. Id.  \nIn 2018, Access Living sued the City of Chicago under Title II of the ADA, \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Fair Housing Act, alleging that Chi-\ncago’s failure to enforce federal accessibility requirements harms the organization by \nundermining the effectiveness of its services, making it more challenging and expen-\nsive for it to connect its clients with affordable, accessible housing. See Compl. Access \nLiving also alleges that the City’s failure to ensure that housing developments in the \naffordable housing scheme comply with federal accessibility requirements effectively \nexcludes people with disabilities—Access Living’s clients— from an equal opportunity \nto obtain affordable housing. Id. ¶¶ 12, 80. \nAccess Living seeks damages to compensate it for the injuries caused by the \nCity’s allegedly discriminatory practices. Id. ¶ 164. Access Living also seeks several \nkinds of injunctive relief. Id. ¶¶ 162–63. It seeks an injunction enjoining the City from \nproviding funds or assistance for housing units that fail to comply with the federal \n4 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 5 of 20 PageID #:8300\naccessibility laws, from failing to bring buildings and units into compliance with the \nfederal accessibility laws, and from failing to provide meaningful access to affordable \nhousing for people with mobility, visual, and hearing disabilities. Id. And the organ-\nization seeks an injunction requiring the City to survey all affordable housing units \nthat receive Chicago Housing Department funds to assess their compliance with the \nfederal accessibility laws, to bring noncompliant units into compliance, to adopt poli-\ncies and procedures to ensure that newly built or renovated units comply with the \nfederal accessibility laws, and to adopt policies and procedures to ensure that owners \nof the City-funded affordable housing units comply with the Federal Accessibility \nLaws. Id. \nEarlier in the case, Chicago moved to dismiss Access Living’s complaint for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim because the com-\nplaint was untimely. R. 24, Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss. The previously assigned judge de-\nnied the motion to dismiss, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the \norganization suffered an injury stemming from the City’s actions and that it was too \nsoon to tell whether the statute of limitations had run. R. 35, Order 03/29/2015. The \nCity now seeks summary judgment, arguing that it does not build, own, or exercise \noperational control over the affordable rental housing, so it cannot be held liable un-\nder the federal accessibility laws. Def.’s Mot.  \nII. Legal Standard \nSummary judgment must be granted “if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \n5 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 6 of 20 PageID #:8301\nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact exists if “the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). In evaluating sum-\nmary judgment motions, courts must view the facts and draw reasonable inferences \nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 \n(2007). The Court may not weigh conflicting evidence or make credibility determina-\ntions, Omnicare, Inc. v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., 629 F.3d 697, 704 (7th Cir. 2011), \nand must consider only evidence that can “be presented in a form that would be ad-\nmissible in evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). The party seeking summary judgment \nhas the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine dispute and that they are \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Carmichael v. Village of Palatine, 605 F.3d \n451, 460 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); \nWheeler v. Lawson, 539 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir. 2008). If this burden is met, the ad-\nverse party must then “set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. \nIII. Analysis \nA. Standing \n  Although the City does not re-raise its Article III standing contention on sum-\nmary judgment, this Court has an independent obligation to ensure that it has subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the cases before it. See R. 308, Def.’s Br.; see also Lujan v. \nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). In the decision on the City’s earlier \nmotion to dismiss, the previously assigned judge found that Access Living adequately \n6 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 7 of 20 PageID #:8302\nalleged a concrete injury that was traceable to the actions of the City: the City’s prac-\ntices hindered Access Living’s day-to-day operations by making it much more difficult \nfor the organization to help place clients in accessible affordable housing. See Or-\nder 03/29/2015 at 7–8. Even more, the City’s alleged failure to ensure compliance with \nthe federal accessibility laws reduces the total amount of services that Access Living \ncan provide, and that the effectiveness of those services is in turn reduced. Id. Noth-\ning in the discovery record undermines this prior finding, so the Court agrees that \nAccess Living has Article III standing. See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. \n363, 373–79 (1982); Common Cause Indiana v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944, 949 (7th Cir. \n2019) (explaining the requirements an organization must satisfy to have standing to \nsue on behalf of its members). \nB. ADA and Section 504 \n  Access Living argues that the City’s failure to ensure that affordable housing \ndevelopments comply with the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in effect \nexcludes Chicagoans with disabilities from the affordable housing program, thus \namounting to disability discrimination. Generally speaking, when it comes to disabil-\nity discrimination in housing, “decades of deliberation and investigation” by Congress \nuncovered that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination, including … the discriminatory effects of architectural … barriers,” \neven in housing. 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (a)(5). Congress thus enacted the Americans with \nDisabilities Act to address the need for a “comprehensive national mandate for the \nelimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” Id. § 12101(b)(1). \n7 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 8 of 20 PageID #:8303\nTitle II of the ADA applies to public entities—like the City of Chicago—and provides \nthat “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” Id. \n§ 12132; see also id. § 12131(1)(b); 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is similarly directed at guaranteeing that \n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability … solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject \nto discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assis-\ntances.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Section 504 requires that individuals with disabilities “be \nprovided with meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers,” one benefit \nbeing the “elimination of architectural barriers.” Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, \n297, 301 (1985). The City is a recipient of federal funds under Section 504: Chicago \nreceived federal funding from HUD for the purpose of providing affordable housing \nfor Chicagoans. See 24 C.F.R. §§ 8.2, 8.3. A “program or activity” under Section 504 \nis defined broadly, including “all of the operations of … a local government; or the \nentity  of  such … local  government  that  distributes  such  assistance ….”  29 \nU.S.C. § 794(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 8.3. \n  The focus of this dispute is whether the affordable housing scheme funded by \nChicago is a “program or activity of” the City under the ADA and Section 504’s re-\nquirements. The ADA and Section 504 use nearly identical language to describe the \nprohibited discriminatory acts, so the Seventh Circuit construes and applies them in \n8 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 9 of 20 PageID #:8304\na consistent manner. See Wagoner v. Lemmon, 778 F.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 2015). This \nOpinion will discuss the two standards together and rely interchangeably on cases \narising under either statute. Under either statute, then, a violation occurs when (1) \na qualified individual with a disability (2) was denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity (3) because, or on the basis of their disability. \nMoore v. W. Illinois Corr. Ctr., 89 F.4th 582, 594 (7th Cir. 2023); 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nFor now, the parties only dispute the second element—whether Access Living’s cli-\nents were denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the City.3 \n  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Access Living, a reasonable \njury could find that the affordable housing scheme is a “service, program, or activity” \nof the City. “Neither the statutory language nor the regulations” shine much light on \nwhat kinds of undertakings the statutes are meant to cover. See Ashby v. Warrick \nCnty. Sch. Corp., 908 F.3d 225, 231 (7th Cir. 2018). The regulations merely suggest \nthat the scope of protection is broad, applying “to all services, programs, and activities \nprovided  or  made  available  by  public  entities.”  28  C.F.R.  § 35.102(a)  (emphasis \nadded). The City explains that the affordable housing scheme cannot be a program of \nthe City because the “presence of funds or tax credits does not impute statutory lia-\nbility on the City” and, even more, the City does not operate the housing develop-\nments,  both  of  which  show  (to  the  City’s  way  of  thinking)  that  the  City  had \n \n3To be sure, the City says in passing that Access Living is not a “qualified” individual, \nbut it does not develop its argument beyond stating this conclusion. See Def.’s Br. at 13. For \nthis reason, the City’s argument on the first element is waived. See Gross v. Town of Cicero, \n619 F.3d 697, 705 (7th Cir. 2010).   \n9 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 10 of 20 PageID #:8305\nintentionally not created an affordable housing program. Def.’s Br. at 8–12. Access \nLiving, on the other hand, argues that the City’s understanding of statutory liability \nis incorrect— “service, program, or activity” is meant to be interpreted broadly and \ncover exactly the kinds of operations like the affordable housing scheme. Pl.’s Resp. \nat 11–12. \nThe Seventh Circuit has identified two principles to help courts work out when \nan endeavor is a “service, program, or activity” of a government agency. First, the \nSeventh Circuit established that “a governmental entity cannot avoid its obligations \nunder the statute by ceding its governmental functions to private entities.” Ashby, \n908 F.3d at 232. It follows that whether the affordable housing scheme is a “program” \nor “activity” will turn in part on whether the City itself is “doing, providing, or making \navailable” the affordable housing, rather than the private developers. Id. Second, the \nSeventh Circuit recognized that the governing regulations contemplate that liability \nmay attach to some relationships between public and private actors. Id. (citing 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1) (explaining that “a public entity may not discriminate on the \nbasis of disability, directly or indirectly, such as ‘through contractual, licensing, or \nother arrangements.’”)). \nThe City’s argument butts heads with these two observations. First, the City \nmay not avoid liability by framing its role in the affordable housing scheme as merely \nproviding funding and tax credits to developers in a way that blanketly absolves the \nCity from its own duty of complying with the federal accessibility laws. The City at-\ntempts  to  frame  its  funding  role  as  not  directly  “doing,  providing,  or  making \n10 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 11 of 20 PageID #:8306\navailable” the affordable housing to place liability directly on the developers who are \nmore involved with the day-to-day operations of the individual developments. Def.’s \nBr. at 8–9. But this goes directly against the principle that the City may not “avoid \nits obligations under the statute by ceding its governmental functions to private en-\ntities.” See Ashby, 908 F.3d at 232. This is not to say that any time a municipality \nprovides some funding to private entities the government then becomes liable for any \nof the project’s failures or legal violations. But here, the record evidence creates a \ngenuine issue of fact on whether the City’s funding and oversight role render it liable \nunder the ADA and Section 504. \nThe City’s closely related position that it cannot be held liable because it does \nnot directly operate and manage the developments fares no better. To support this \nargument, the City explains that its contracts with the developers place property-\nmanagement responsibilities on the developers. Def.’s Br. at 9–12. In this way, the \nCity argues, the developers agree to assume compliance obligations. See id. The City \nalso offers evidence that it is not involved with the oversight of the developments \nbecause it does not own any of the developments, it is not a landlord or manager of \nany of the developments, it is not a party to any lease agreements, nor does it receive \nrental payments from any of the developments’ tenants See DSOF ¶¶ 45–56.  \nThere are several problems with this position. First, the contracts themselves \ncontemplate (or at the very least, a reasonable jury could so find) a general oversight \nor compliance obligation placed on the City by requiring that the developers comply \nwith federal laws before receiving funding. The contracts set out, for example, that \n11 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 12 of 20 PageID #:8307\nthe City agrees, pursuant to the Municipal Code of Chicago, to “supervise[] and coor-\ndinate[] the formulation and execution of projects and programs creating safe, decent, \nand affordable housing for residents of the City.” See DSOF Exh. 33 at 2. Certain \nagreements even explicitly require the developers to comply with Section 504 and the \nADA and permit the City to inspect the developments for compliance. See, e.g., DSOF \nExh. 8 § 2.27; R. 309-34, DSOF Exh. 34 § 6.01(a). The contractual relationship be-\ntween the City and the developers, then, is evidence that the affordable housing \nscheme is a program or activity that is “made available,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.102(a), by the \nCity. \nDespite the unambiguous terms of the contracts, the City insists that it makes \nall the difference under the federal accessibility laws that Chicago is not the owner, \noperator, or property manager of any of the individual developments. See Def.’s Br. \nat 9–12. The City is correct that it does not have these specified relationships with \nthe developments and tenants. But the City cannot simply “ced[e] its governmental \nfunctions,” Ashby, 908 F.3d at 232—ensuring compliance with the federal accessibil-\nity laws—to the developers.  \nIndeed, the City has a regulatory obligation to ensure that the private devel-\nopers comply with the federal accessibility laws. For example, the receipt of certain \nfederal funds requires recipients of federal funds (in this case, the City) to comply \nwith program requirements and to monitor subcontractors for such compliance. See \n24 C.F.R. §§ 92.219(b)(2)(iii), 92.504(a). This includes, among other things, an obliga-\ntion that recipients inspect each project for compliance with the federal accessibility \n12 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 13 of 20 PageID #:8308\nlaws and other property standards, both upon completion of the building and also \nperiodically during the rental property’s affordability period to ensure ongoing com-\npliance. See 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.504(d), 92.251. Similarly, the ADA Title II regulation \nrequires accessibility in facilities newly constructed or rehabilitated “by, on behalf of, \nor for the use of a public entity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a)(1). If recipients of federal funds \ncould evade liability by simply placing the burden on third-parties with which the \nrecipient enters into a contract, then the statutes would lose much of their force.  \nWhat’s more, if the jury finds that the affordable housing scheme is a program \nor activity of the City, then the program in its entirety must comply with the federal \naccessibility laws—even those developments that do not directly receive federal funds \nvia the City. The analysis under the ADA is straightforward. The developments must \ncomply with the ADA because a public entity—the City—is providing the service or \nprogram. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) (qualified individuals participate in the “programs or \nactivities provided by a public entity”). \nCompliance with Section 504 warrants more discussion. Even though certain \ndevelopments do not receive federal funds, the entire program must comply with Sec-\ntion 504 because the statute defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations” of \nthe funding recipient. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. § 8.3; see Schroeder v. Chicago, \n927 F.2d 957, 962 (7th Cir. 1991) (explaining that “program or activity” is intention-\nally broad). So the City need not determine which individual buildings must comply \nwith Section 504—because all of the buildings that are part of the City’s “program” \nare swept up under Section 504’s purview. \n13 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 14 of 20 PageID #:8309\nIn sum, a jury must decide whether the City’s affordable housing scheme is a \nqualifying “program” or “activity” of the City and, if so, the jury must determine \nwhether Access Living was denied the benefits of the program or activity. \nC. Fair Housing Act \nAccess Living raises a similar claim for discrimination under the Fair Housing \nAct. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful “[t]o discriminate against any person in \nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision \nof services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap ….” \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2). Discrimination under the Housing Act includes “a failure to \ndesign and construct those dwellings in such a manner that … [they] are readily ac-\ncessible to and usable by handicapped persons … [and] contain [specified] features of \nadaptive design.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(C).  \nIn this case, the parties dispute whether the City could be held liable under \nthe Fair Housing Act. Access Living argues that the City is a central participant in \nthe design and construction process, especially through the permit-review process, \nand is thus responsible for discrimination in the construction of the housing develop-\nments. See Pl.’s Resp. at 27–34. But the City maintains that the third-party develop-\ners are, in fact, the parties responsible for the design and development of the housing. \nSee Def.’s Br. at 18–20.  \n  Based on the evidence presented, and viewing the evidence in Access Living’s \nfavor for now, a reasonable jury can find that the City must comply with the Housing \nAct because of Chicago’s role in the design and construction of the affordable housing \n14 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 15 of 20 PageID #:8310\ndevelopments. Remember that the Housing Act’s prohibitions are not directed at a \nspecific actor. Instead, the prohibitions ban an outcome without requiring “who the \nactor is, or how such actors” discriminate against potential tenants. See N.A.A.C.P. \nv. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 287, 298 (7th Cir. 1992) (emphasis omitted). And \nthe Housing Act should be interpreted broadly. See Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., \n409 U.S. 205, 209 (1972). Under those principles, it is reasonable to hold that the \nCity, in its role providing funding for the housing developments, approving the con-\nstruction and rehabilitation of the developments, and its contractual obligation to \nensure that the developments comply with federal law “discriminate[d] against [a] \nperson in the … conditions … of sale or rental of a dwelling” by its “failure to design \nand construct those dwellings in such a manner that … [is] readily accessible to and \nusable by handicapped persons.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2), (f)(3)(C). At the very least, a \nreasonable jury could so find.  \n  The City contends that “the responsibility of complying with the provisions of \nthe FHA would fall solely on the person actually responsible for the property.” Def.’s \nBr. at 20 (citing Indep. Living Ctr. of S. California v. City of Los Angeles, 2012 WL \n13036779, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2012)). But the evidence presented here gives rise \nto a question of fact on whether the City is responsible for the property based on the \nCity’s extensive role in the affordable housing scheme. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 978 \nF.2d at 298; see also Oconomowoc Res. Programs, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 300 F.3d \n775, 782, 787 (7th Cir. 2002) (finding a municipality liable for a discriminatory denial \n15 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 16 of 20 PageID #:8311\nof a zoning permit for a group home even though the municipality did not own, oper-\nate, or manage the housing). Summary judgment on this claim too is denied. \nD. Statute of Limitations \nNext, the City argues that the statute of limitations extinguishes many devel-\nopments from forming the basis of the claims. But a reasonable jury can find that the \nstatute of limitations did not expire because the City has engaged in a pattern of \ndiscrimination in its affordable housing scheme, so much so that there is a continuing \nviolation of the federal accessibility laws. The City argues that each of Access Living’s \nclaims are untimely because Section 504, the ADA, and the FHA are subject to a two-\nyear statute of limitations. Def.’s Br. at 20–21; 42 U.S.C.§ 3613(a)(1)(A) (FHA); see \nalso Cheeney v. Highland Cmty. College, 15 F.3d 79, 81 (7th Cir. 1994) (applying two-\nyear statute of limitations to ADA and Section 504 from Illinois’s personal injury \nstatute); 735 ILCS 5/13-202. Access Living concedes that the statute of limitations \nunder each statute is two years but argues that its claims are timely because it is \nexperiencing continuous discrimination under the “continuing violations exception.” \nPl.’s Br. at 34–38. \n  The continuing-violations exception tolls the statute of limitations for certain \nclaims if the plaintiff can prove that otherwise time barred actions are related to ac-\ntions occurring within the limitation period. See Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at \n380–81. The plaintiff instead has until two years after the “last asserted occurrence \nof [the discriminatory] practice.” County of Cook v. Bank of America, Corp., 181 F. \nSupp. 3d 513, 520 (N.D. Ill. 2015) (quoting Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 380–81)). \n16 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 17 of 20 PageID #:8312\nThe doctrine recognizes that certain claims are more like a “persistent process of il-\nlegal discrimination” rather than a discrete, completed discriminatory act. See Tyus \nv. Urban Search Mgmt., 102 F.3d 256, 265 (7th Cir. 1996). \n  The Seventh Circuit currently recognizes a continuing-violations exception for \nHousing Act discriminatory-practice claims but has yet to apply the exception to ADA \nor Section 504 claims. 42 U.S.C.§ 3613(a)(1)(A) (explaining that a Housing Act civil \nenforcement action must be filed “not later than 2 years after the occurrence or the \ntermination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice”). Given the similarity of \nthe statutes and the close relationship of the claims, and consistent with other district \ncourts, this Court will apply the exception to the ADA and Section 504 claims. See, \ne.g., Deck v. City of Toledo, 56 F. Supp. 2d 886 (N.D. Ohio 1999) (ADA); D.G. v. Som-\nerset Hill Sch. Dist., 559 F. Supp. 2d 484 (D.N.J. 2008) (Rehabilitation Act).    \n  Access  Living  has  presented  sufficient evidence  to  create  a  jury  issue  on \nwhether the City has engaged in a “pattern” of discrimination. Access Living has de-\nclared that it is not challenging the continual ill-effects arising from a single (or mul-\ntiple) past violation. See Tyus, 102 F.3d at 265–266. Instead, Access Living is chal-\nlenging the City’s ongoing failure to comply with and enforce the federal accessibility \nlaws. See Compl. at ¶¶ 1–2, 6–12; R. 33, Pl.’s Resp. Mot. to Dismiss at 12; Pl.’s Resp. \nat 34. This distinction is important. If Access Living were to claim that it—or its cli-\nents—were suffering the ongoing effects of non-compliant housing, like a building \nhaving a defective elevator, much of the claim would likely not fit the continuing-\nviolations exception. See Bank of America, 181 F. Supp. 3d at 520 (citing Havens \n17 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 18 of 20 PageID #:8313\nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 380–81)). But alleging that there is an ongoing, systemic \nfailure of the City to fulfill its contractual and statutory obligations is something al-\ntogether different. This kind of failure is ongoing and not a single isolated incident. \nSee id. And each day brings with it a renewed violation of the laws because the City \ncontinues not to perform its statutory duties (or so the liability theory goes). The stat-\nute of limitations issue must be decided at trial as well.  \nE. Private Right of Action \n  Access Living has a private right of action to sue the City under each of the \nfederal accessibility laws. “[P]rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be \ncreated by Congress.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001). To determine \nwhether a statute creates a private cause of action, “[t]he judicial task is to interpret \nthe statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create \nnot just a private right but also a private remedy.” Id.  \n  The City does not actually contest that each of the federal accessibility laws \ncontains a private right of action. See Def.’s Br.; R. 318, Def.’s Reply. Instead, the City \nargues that Access Living sued under the laws to enforce the underlying regulations, \nand not to obtain the respective statutory remedies. Def.’s Br. at 26–29. The City \nmisreads the Complaint. Access Living cites the regulations to provide the context \nand the definitions needed to apply the statutory provisions. Access Living does not, \nas the City believes, ask the Court to enforce the regulations that Access Living cites. \nSee, e.g., Compl. ¶ 27 (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.149 to explain prohibited discrimination \nunder Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132). \n18 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 19 of 20 PageID #:8314\nHere, each statute supplies a cause of action and Access Living falls within the \nintended class of plaintiffs of each statute. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286. For the \nreasons explained earlier in this Opinion, Access Living presents sufficient evidence \nthat it is a “person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability” under Title II of \nthe ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12133; a “person aggrieved” within the meaning of Section 504, \n29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2); and an “aggrieved person” authorized to file suit and seek re-\nlief against the City under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3602, 3612–13. PSOF \n¶¶ 38, 40; R. 314-27 Feidt Dep. at 197:24–198:22, 292:2–13. Access Living thus has a \ncause of action under each statute to bring its claims. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286. \nIV. Conclusion \nThe City’s motion for summary judgment is denied. The remaining disputes \nfor the jury are, at the least: (1) how the facts apply to the definitions of “program” or \n“activity” to trigger the application of the federal accessibility laws; (2) whether the \nCity’s involvement in design and construction triggers the obligations under the Fair \nHousing Act; and (3) whether the continuing-violations exception applies to set the \nproper statute of limitations. The Court also orders the parties to engage in settle-\nment negotiations. If negotiations stall or falter, then the Court will set a trial sched-\nule. During pretrial litigation, the Court will ask the parties to address whether the \nCourt is bound for purposes of injunctive relief by any jury decision on liability; and \nwhat the damages presentation at trial would entail. For now, though, the parties \nshall engage in good-faith settlement negotiations. It would seem that both sides \nwould want to minimize the risks and delay of further litigation, and indeed the City \n19 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-03399 Document #: 335 Filed: 09/30/24 Page 20 of 20 PageID #:8315\nnaturally should want to fashion an affordable housing “program” (whether in statu-\ntory or non-statutory terms) that promotes compliance with the federal accessibility \nlaws. The parties shall file a status report, on or before November 4, 2024, on the \nstatus of negotiations and the proposed next step of the litigation.  \n                ENTERED:   \n \n \n                  s/Edmond E.
