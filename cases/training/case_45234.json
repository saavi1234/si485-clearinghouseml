All parties in Case No. 4:23-cv-00474 and Case No. 4:23-cv-00478 have now responded and confirmed that they do not intend to offer live testimony at the hearing on the motions for preliminary injunction. The Court is therefore satisfied that the single consolidated hearing on December 22, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., will be sufficient to address the motions in both cases. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Penguin House Plaintiffs' request for a separate hearing. The Court anticipates the following order of events at the December 22 hearing: (1) the GLBT Youth Plaintiffs will present argument on their motion; (2) the Penguin House Plaintiffs will present argument on their motion; (3) the State of Iowa Defendants will present argument in response to both the GLBT Youth and Penguin House motions; (4) any other Defendants wishing to be heard will present argument; (5) the GLBT Youth Plaintiffs will present rebuttal argument, if any; and (6) the Penguin House Plaintiffs will present rebuttal argument, if any. There are no other hearings scheduled before the undersigned on December 22, and thus all parties will be given as much time as they reasonably believe they need to argue their positions. The Court is likely to have substantial questions for all sides regarding, among other things, the constitutional rights at issue, the scope and governing standards for those rights, and the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the challenged legislation.

    "summary": "<p>The Iowa governor signed SF 496 into law on May 26, 2023. SF 496 includes an Age-Appropriate Standard, an Identity and Orientation Prohibition, a Library Restriction provision (together, the Book Restriction provisions), and a Parental Notice provision. The Age-Appropriate Standard dictates that school libraries must contain &ldquo;only age-appropriate materials&rdquo; which cannot include &ldquo;any material with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act.&rdquo; SF 496 defines sex act broadly and does not account for the value of a book as a whole or its literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value. The Age-Appropriate Act also draws no distinction between what is appropriate for a kindergartener versus a high school student. &nbsp;The Identity and Orientation Prohibition also prohibits school libraries from providing any program or promotion relating to &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; or &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; to students in kindergarten through sixth grade. SF 496 does not define what constitutes a program or promotion, nor does it provide guidance was to what types of materials &ldquo;relate&rdquo; to gender identity or sexual orientation. Under SF 496, teachers, libraries, and other educators face license sanctions and adverse employment actions for violations of SF 496, including termination of their employment. The Library Restriction provision facilitates anonymous complaints by parents requesting the removal of material from classrooms and libraries. Finally, the Parental Notice provision mandates that school officials notify a student&rsquo;s parent or guardian when the student asked to use a name or pronouns that differ from those in the school&rsquo;s records, even if the official is aware that a student will be rendered unsafe or vulnerable to abuse as a result. SF 496 was set to go into effect on January 1, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>On November 28, 2023, an LGBTQ+ non-profit and eight students attending Iowa schools brought this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Represented by the ACLU of Iowa, Lambda Legal, and private counsel, plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the Governor of Iowa, the Iowa Department of Education (IDOE), the director of IDOE, the Iowa State Board of Education (ISBE), the Iowa City Community School District, the Sioux City Community School District, the Urbandale Community School District, the Waterloo Community School District, and the West Des Moines Community School District, as well as each of the school district superintendents and individual members of their school boards. Plaintiffs alleged that the Age-Appropriate Standard and Identity and Orientation Prohibition provisions of SF 496 violated Plaintiffs&rsquo; First and Fourteenth Amendment rights in several ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction provisions constituted content- and viewpoint-based restrictions on the right to receive information in violation of Student Plaintiffs&rsquo; First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction and Parental Notice provisions violated all Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment by chilling and depriving their freedom of speech and expression.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction and Parental Notice provisions violated all Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment by depriving their freedom of expressive association.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction and Parental Notice provisions violated all Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment because it was unconstitutionally vague.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction provisions violated all Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment because it was unconstitutionally overbroad.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction and Parental Notice provisions violated the rights of all Plaintiffs to Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status.</li>\r\n<li>The Book Restriction and Parental Notice provisions violated all Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 4071, by denying equal access or a fair opportunity to Gay Straight Alliances in schools.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs asked that the court grant declaratory relief, attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs, and permanent injunctive relief enjoining defendants from enforcing the relevant provisions of SF 496. The case was assigned to Judge Stephen H. Lochner and Magistrate Judge Stephen B. Jackson.</p>\r\n<p>Contemporaneously with their complaint, on November 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin defendants form enforcing SF 496 while the litigation proceeded. On December 19, 2023, school district defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction, and the state defendants filed their opposition on December 20.</p>\r\n<p>The school district defendants also filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on December 20, arguing that (1) the school district defendants were not the moving force behind Plaintiffs&rsquo; injuries, (2) the school district defendants could not be held liable for following state law, and (3) alternatively, the claims against the individual school district officials should be dismissed as duplicative of the claims against the school districts.</p>\r\n<p>The court held oral argument regarding Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction on December 22, 2023. This oral argument was held simultaneously with the oral argument for a motion for preliminary injunction in Penguin Random House, LLC v. Robbins, 4:23-cv-00478, which also challenged the constitutionality of SF 496.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2023, the district court granted in part Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction. The court enjoined defendants from enforcing the Book Restriction provisions, but denied Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction as it pertained to the Parental Notice provision. The court first analyzed which plaintiffs had standing to challenge which provisions of SF 496. The court found that students had standing to challenge the Book Restriction provision because it directly restricted what books they could access in their school&rsquo;s library. However, seven of eight Student Plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the Book Restriction provisions insofar as Student Plaintiffs argued that such provisions restricted their freedom of speech or association, as the court found that any such restriction was a result of Plaintiffs&rsquo; perception of the law rather than the law itself. Only one Student Plaintiff had standing to bring such a first amendment challenge because she was the only plaintiff under grade six, and SF 496 therefore posed stricter restrictions on her compared to her co-plaintiffs. Additionally, the court found that no Student Plaintiff had standing to challenge the Parental Notice provision because all of the named Student Plaintiffs were already out to their families and as such suffered no concrete injury. Turning to the merits of parties&rsquo; arguments, the court found that the Age-Appropriate Standard was overbroad and unlikely to survive any standard of scrutiny and that the Identity and Orientation Prohibition, while facially neutral, was likely void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment. For these reasons, the court enjoined defendants from enforcing the Book Restriction provisions while the case proceeded. 2023 WL 9052113.</p>\r\n<p>The state defendants appealed the court&rsquo;s order on preliminary injunction on January 12, 2024 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (24-1075).</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2024, defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending the appeal in the Eighth Circuit. On the same day, the district court temporarily granted the motion, asking Plaintiffs and school district defendants to respond to their motion explaining how they would be harmed by a stay pending appeal. Following motion practice, the district court partially lifted the stay, setting a deadline for Plaintiffs to respond to school district defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on February 27, 2024, and school district defendants filed their reply on March 8, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>In the district court, Plaintiffs filed a motion to allow limited discovery and motion practice on May 21, 2024. Specifically, Plaintiffs asked to proceed with limited discovery against the school board defendants only. Plaintiffs also asked to move to amend their complaint only as it pertained to claims not on appeal in the Eighth Circuit. Finally, Plaintiffs asked for leave to move to renew their motion for preliminary injunction as to the Parental Notice provision, as they sought to amend their complaint with facts demonstrating injury and standing. The district court granted the motion on May 23, 2024, allowing Plaintiffs to proceed with limited discovery and move to amend their complaint a renew their motion for preliminary injunction. The Plaintiffs filed their motions the same day. Also on the same day, state defendants moved for the court to reconsider its order granting Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion, arguing allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint now as opposed to after the Eighth Circuit ruled on their appeal would prejudice them significantly. On May 24, the district court denied defendant&rsquo;s motion to reconsider and Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to amend but gave both parties leave to refile.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, in the Eighth Circuit, the state defendants moved to stay proceedings in the district court pending their appeal. The Eighth Circuit granted defendants&rsquo; motion on May 28, 2024 without giving their reasoning. In response to the circuit court&rsquo;s order, the district court denied school district defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs&rsquo; renewed motion for preliminary injunction on May 29, 2024, and stayed all proceedings in the district court.</p>\r\n<p>The Eighth Circuit set oral argument for June 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 9, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction that had blocked enforcement of Iowa&rsquo;s Senate File 496, holding that the lower court didn&rsquo;t apply a broad enough interpretation as the Plaintiffs brought a facial challenge to SF 496. Thus, the appellate court vacated the injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings, while noting plaintiffs were still free to seek injunctive relief under the framework set out in Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2397 (2024).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The District Court issued an order requesting the Plaintiffs submit amended pleadings on September 25, 2024, after the Eighth Circuit vacated the preliminary order injunction in this case and the related case: Penguin Random House, LLC v. Robbins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Back in the District Court, Plaintiffs filed a renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction on their claims that SF 496 was overbroad, vague, and infringed upon their First Amendment rights pursuant to the requirements for a facial challenge set out in the Eighth Circuit&rsquo;s opinion on October 19, 2024. In support of this motion, Plaintiffs filed a brief arguing that SF 496 violated the First and Second Amendments through its three principal provisions: the &ldquo;Library Restriction,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Gender Identity Notification Provision.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />On October 23, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which included an updated factual background discussing events pertaining to the original preliminary injunction and a renewed request for injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />On February 6, 2025, the District Court heard arguments regarding Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for preliminary injunction, and on May 15, 2025, the Court granted and denied the motion in part. The court held that restrictions on &ldquo;curriculum, tests, surveys, questionnaires, or instruction&rdquo; about gender identity or sexual orientation for kindergarten through sixth-grade students could survive if narrowly interpreted to bar only mandatory instruction giving detailed explanations or normative views, but not neutral references. However, it found the bans on &ldquo;programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;promotions&rdquo; facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, thereby protecting student groups like GSAs and permitting schools to advertise and support them. The court also struck down the parental notification law as unconstitutionally vague except for cases where a student requests different pronouns. The court reaffirmed its earlier injunction blocking book bans on works containing sexual acts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />In response to the Court granting in part the Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for preliminary injunction, Defendants gave notice of appeal on June 13, 2025. Shortly thereafter, on June 15, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings, which was granted on the same day.</p>",

Defendants appealed the courtโs order on preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Oral argument was set for June 11, 2024. On August 9th, the Court of Appeals reversed the injunction, holding that the district court's legal reasoning was flawed and remanded proceedings. In response, on October 19th, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, followed by their first amended complaint four days later on October 23rd, 2024. After hearing arguments, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion for preliminary injunction on May 14, 2025.

Plaintiffs are a non-profit advocacy organization serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer, or questioning (โLGBTQ+โ) Iowa youth, which brings suit on behalf of the \norganization itself and on behalf of the organizationโs members comprising both individual \nstudents and gender sexuality alliance chapters1 (โGSAsโ), six LGBTQ+ students from Iowa who \nattend Iowa public schools and whose ages range from ten to seventeen, and two educators. They \nchallenge as unconstitutional and unlawful under federal statute SF 496, a sweeping piece of \nlegislation signed into law by Governor Kim Reynolds on May 26, 2023, which primarily amends \nportions of Title VII (Education and Cultural Affairs) of the Iowa Code.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343 \nbecause this action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988 and seeks to secure equitable relief under an Act of \nCongress, 20 U.S.C. ยง 4071.  \n3.   This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because Defendants are \ndomiciled in the State of Iowa and the deprivation of Plaintiffsโ rights arises out of and relates to \nDefendantsโ official duties in the State of Iowa.  \n4.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(1) and (2). \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n5.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS is a mission-driven not-for-profit 501(c)(3) \n \n1 GSAs are noncurricular clubs for LGBTQ+ students and their allies to find fellowship and \ncommunity. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 4 of 177\n \norganization founded in 2002 and based in Des Moines, Iowa. The mission of IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS is to provide safe, supportive, and nurturing learning environments and communities \nfor LGBTQ+ and allied youth through education, outreach, advocacy, and direct services. IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLS pursues this mission by providing services to its members, which include \nindividual students and GSAs. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ flagship program is the GSA Network, \nthrough which IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS provides services and resources to student members and \nmember GSAs to empower them in pursuing inclusive school policies, combating anti-LGBTQ+ \nbulling, and supporting one another. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS provides individualized support to \nits  student  members  and  member  GSAs,  including  through  on-site,  in-person  visits,  direct \nconsultation, and connections and coordination with other student groups and IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS opportunities. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS hosts multiple annual student-focused events \nfor its members and maintains regular contact with them to provide guidance and address their \nneeds at school. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS assists its student members and member GSAs in their \nadvocacy efforts, and additionally advocates on their behalf through coordination with membersโ \neducators and school districts. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS further performs data collection with \nrespect to incidents of anti-LGBTQ+ bullying, harassment, and discrimination, and provides \nservices and resources to its members experiencing trauma or tragedy, most notably the loss of a \nfriend and fellow member to suicide.  \n6.  IOWA  SAFE  SCHOOLS  also  pursues  its  mission  by  providing  professional \ndevelopment, licensure renewal, and graduate credits to educators individually and district-wide. \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS provides these services through direct consultation programs, in which \nit meets with Iowa educators and school districts to provide guidance on understanding and \nmeeting the needs of LGBTQ+ students; an online Iowa Safe Schools Academy that offers \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 5 of 177\n \ncoursework for the fulfillment of license renewal obligations and graduate credits, coursework that \nis primarily focused on supporting different student groups, including LGBTQ+ students; and \nmultiple annual conference and symposium opportunities, including the Engage and Empower \nSummit, the Trans Education Summit, and the Anti-Violence Symposium. Through these services, \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS works with and provides guidance and programming to educators and \nschool  districts  in  developing  and  implementing  school  policies  and  practices  inclusive  of \nLGBTQ+ students and respectful of LGBTQ+ studentsโ rights.  \n7.  IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS appears in a dual capacity because as an organization its \nArticle III standing can be satisfied in two ways.  \na.  With respect to certain claims2 asserted herein, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS asserts \ndirect organizational standing on its own behalf because SF 496 has perceptibly \nimpaired its ability to provide services and referral services to students, both \nindividually and through its member GSAs. By chilling the speech and expressive \nassociation of its member GSAs and students, the law directly interferes with core \nmission and business of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS. SF 496 has further directly \ninterfered with the core mission and business of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS by \nprohibiting,  discouraging,  and  heightening  the  risk  to  students  and  educators \npursuing or implementing the inclusive school policies and practices advocated by \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS. \nb.  With respect to other claims asserted herein, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS asserts \nrepresentational standing by appearing on behalf of its members, which includes \n \n2 Individual counts alleged herein specifically identify the capacity in which IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS appears in bringing them. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 6 of 177\n \nboth GSAs as well as individual students who may or may not be currently active \nin a GSA. \n8.

SF  496  has  altered  the  landscape  for  Iowa  schools  and  students  through  its \nunconstitutional and discriminatory provisions.  \n36.  SF 496, as a whole, in its intent, purpose, and effect, is designed to and is \naccomplishing the silencing and marginalization of students, particularly LGBTQ+ students.  \n37.  Plaintiffs highlight three particular provisions of SF 496 that have caused and will \ncontinue to cause the most damage: those relating to the content of school libraries, those relating \nto the discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation, and those requiring the reporting of \nstudents expressing a wish for affirmation in their gender identity.   \nThe Library Restriction  \n38.  SF 496 includes multiple provisions that impact and restrict the availability of \nbooks and other materials in Iowa schools.  \n39.  Of particular note is the provision of SF 496 that provides: โEach school district \nshall establish a kindergarten through grade twelve library program that is consistent with section \n280.6 and with the educational standards established in this section, contains only age-appropriate \nmaterials, and supports the student achievement goals of the total school curriculum.โ SF 496, Div. \nI, ยง 2 (codified at Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(2)).  \n40.  Prior to SF 496, Iowa Code used the term โage appropriateโ only in reference to \nhealth class. The term, which has a common understanding of meaning suitable for a particular \nage or age group, was defined separately as โtopics, messages, and teaching methods suitable to \nparticular  ages  or  age  groups  of  children  and  adolescents,  based  on  developing  cognitive, \nemotional, and behavioral capacity typical for the age or age group.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.50(10)(a).  \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 14 of 177\n \n41.  Rather than relying upon the ordinary understanding or existing definition in Iowa \nCode, SF 496 created a new definition, which begins by reiterating the above, but then includes an \nexpress exception: โAge-appropriateโ does not include any material with descriptions or visual \ndepictions of a sex act as defined in section 702.17.โ SF 496, Div. I, ยง 4 (codified at Iowa Code ยง \n256.11(19)(a)(1).  \n42.  As noted, the term โsex actโ is separately defined in Iowaโs criminal law, alongside \nthe term โsexual activityโ; specifically, for purposes of offenses such as lascivious conduct. See \nIowa Code ยง 702.17. The criminal law defines these terms as โany sexual contact between two or \nmore persons by any of the following,โ before listing six examples of qualifying contact between \ntwo or more personsโ various body parts. See id. \n43.  In short, these provisions of SF 496 obligate Iowa schools to remove any material \nthat includes a description or depiction of a sex act. These provisions of SF 496 have been referred \nto as โbook bans.โ Hereinafter, this will be referred to as the โLibrary Restrictionโ of SF 496.  \n44.  Most terms within the Library Restriction are undefined.  \n45.  The term โlibrary programโ itself has no separate definition within SF 496 or the \nIowa Code. The term has been reasonably understood in various Iowa school districts as the entire \noffering  of  books  within  the  school  for  student  access,  including  those  within  a  teacherโs \nclassroom; a separately designated space within each school for the storage, display, and student \naccess of books and other materials; an arrangement with a local community library to provide \nstudent access during school hours to the books and materials available; or even a โLittle Free \nLibraryโ consisting of a container of books freely donated and removed by students located on or \nnear school grounds.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 15 of 177\n \n46.  The term โmaterialsโ is not given a definition, either. In context with the word \nโlibrary,โ some school districts have reasonably understood it to include books, periodicals, or \nother examples of a tangible, written word. However, the Library Restriction does not give any \nindication as to its potential application to portable digital media, such as audiobooks or CDs, nor \nas to publications and other informationโor โmaterialsโโavailable on computers provided in \nschool libraries for student access.  \n47.  Crucially, the Library Restriction fails to define what constitutes a โdescription or \nvisual depiction.โ  Whether a word, collection of words, or image โdescribesโ or โdepictsโ \nsomething is inherently a subjective inquiry; only the reader or viewer of the material receives the \nmental image created by the description or depiction, influenced by their own understanding and \nexperiences.  \n48.  The Library Restriction does not, for example, provide qualifying or quantifying \nlanguage that would address how specific a description or depiction must be, how frequent such \ndescriptions or depictions must occur within a work, or how explicitly they must reveal to the \nrecipient of their message that they are referencing the occurrenceโreal or fictionalโof a โsex \nact.โ Whether a description or depiction may be offensive or benign to the reader is immaterial to \nits removal.  \n49.  Given  the  creative  medium  of  expression  it  seeks  to  regulate,  the  Library \nRestriction noticeably declines to include any authorization for a school or school employee to \nconsider the intended effect of a material, such as whether it appeals to a prurient interest, meaning \na material containing any description or depiction, even if not intended to evoke sexual excitement \nin the reader, must automatically be removed.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 16 of 177\n \n50.  Similarly, the Library Restriction declines to authorize those applying it to consider \nthe merit or quality of the material as a whole. Any isolated description or depiction of a sex act \nmandates the materialโs removal from the library program, regardless of whether the work is \nconsidered a historic or modern-day classic, an essential piece of reading for a college preparatory \nclass, or expressing a message of support or inclusion of particular relevance and importance to its \nintended audience.  \n51.  Nor does the Library Restriction allow those applying it to consider the grade level \nor levels to which the material is made available. Students in grades 11 and 12 are limited in their \naccess to books in the same way as a student in kindergarten.  \n52.  The Library Restriction contains a single exception from its scope: compliance with \nIowa Code ยง 280.6, which states, โReligious books such as the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran \nshall not be excluded from any public school or institution in the state.โ Accordingly, the Library \nRestriction permits such religious books regardless of whether they include a description or \ndepiction of a sex act. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(1)); see also Iowa Code \nยง 280.6.    \n53.  SF 496 enforces compliance with the Library Restriction mainly through a newly \ncreated system of investigation and discipline. SF 496 charges the Department of Education with \ninvestigating library programs in Iowa schools for potential violations of the Library Restriction \nand,  upon  finding  a  violation,  with  issuing  progressively  severe  disciplinary  actionโup  to \nrevocation of an educatorโs license and even loss of school accreditation. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 \n(codified at Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(3)(a)โ(b)).   \n54.  SF 496 also encourages third party monitoring of schoolsโ and school employeesโ \ncompliance with the Library Restriction, by requiring the online publication of all books made \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 17 of 177\n \navailable to students in the school district and authorizing anonymous requests for removal of any \nsuch book or any other โbook, article, outline, handout, video, or other educational material that is \navailable to students.โ SF 496, Div. II, ยง 13 (codified at Iowa Code ยง 279.77(3), (4)). \n55.  Prior to the Library Restriction, the books and materials within Iowa schools were \nselected, in the case of separately identified school library spaces, by qualified teacherโlibrarians \napplying their expertise to select and maintain an appropriate collection of books and materials of \nbenefit to the students, and the studentsโ education, in the applicable building. Individual teachers \nalso maintained typically smaller collections of books and materials relevant to their studentsโ \ncoursework or otherwise suitable for the students accessing their classrooms. These decisions \nwere, in either case, subject to the oversight of the local school board, which is authorized to hear \nand decide objections to the inclusion of books and materials.  \n56.  Since the Library Restriction was enacted, there has been a statewide culling of \nbooks and materials available in Iowa schools, whether in designated school libraries or in \nindividual teacher classrooms. The number of books removed is estimated to be at least around \n3,400, a figure that is likely underreported as many schools quietly remove books without \npublicizing having done so. Iowa students have thus lost access to untold quantities of information \nthat had otherwise been carefully selected for them as suitable for their age and educational \ndevelopment.  \nThe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition \n57.  SF  496  includes  a  sweeping  section  titled,  โSexual  orientation  and  gender \nidentityโprohibited instruction,โ that forbids any mention of sexual orientation or gender identity \nfrom kindergarten through the sixth grade, in or outside of the classroom. Specifically, the law \nprohibits school districts from providing โany program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 18 of 177\n \npromotion,  or  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  to  students  in \nkindergarten through grade six.โ SF 496, Div. II, ยง 16 (Iowa Code ยง 279.80(1)-(2)). This provision \nof SF 496 has been referred to as a โdonโt say gay or transโ law. Hereinafter, this provision of SF \n496  will  be  referred  to  as  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Prohibition,  or  โGISO \nProhibition.โ \n58.  Unlike the Library Restriction, the GISO Prohibition does not include an exception \nfor human growth and development instruction, i.e., health class. Id. ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(2)-\n(3)); SF 496, Div. II, ยง 9 (Iowa Code ยง 279.50(1), (1A)). The seven separate prohibited types of \nspeech  under  the  GISO  Prohibitionโany  program,  curriculum,  test,  survey,  questionnaire, \npromotion, or instructionโtaken together would encompass all activities remotely associated with \na school.  \n59.  By using these terms without separate definition, elaboration, or other reference, \nthe GISO Prohibition fails to set any limits or bounds on the circumstances to which it applies, \nsuch that its restrictions conceivably apply to:  \na.  with respect to โprogramโ: in-class and out-of-class activities, coursework, \nschool libraries, extracurricular groups, school performances, sports teams, \nbathrooms, after-school events, field trips, or any other offering or activity that \nmay conceivably occur on or off school grounds if associated with the school;  \nb.  with respect to โcurriculumโ: the courses offered, the assignments or projects \ngiven, studentsโ self-directed work or the presentation of their work in class, or \nan educatorโs statements or guidance in class;  \nc.  with respect to โsurveyโ: formalized surveys such as the Iowa Youth Survey or \nthe CDCโs Youth Risk Behavior Survey, or general questions posed to or \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 19 of 177\n \nassessments taken of a student or group of students (nor whether a โsurveyโ \nholds a separate meaning from โquestionnaireโ or โtestโ);   \nd.  with respect to โpromotionโ: displays in school hallways or classrooms, a \ndisplay of books or other materials, in-class reading or discussion, educatorsโ \nself-identification, acknowledgement or affirmance of students, extracurricular \ngroups or events, or any other speech, act, or symbol that may be construed as \nโpromotingโ a prohibited concept; and,  \ne.  with respect to โinstructionโ: a lecture given to a seated class, discussions with \nstudents on lessons or their ideas or general wellbeing, discussions between \nstudents  and  educators  to  form  a  positive  relationship  to  facilitate  class \nparticipation, or even the permission of a studentโs own speech or expressive \nconduct in or out of class.  \n60.  As shown by this non-exhaustive list of potential circumstances to which the GISO \nProhibition, by its use of seven undefined terms, may apply, the GISO Prohibition makes no \ndistinction  based  upon  whether  the  activity  is  mandatory  or  permissive,  curricular  or \nextracurricular. The GISO Prohibitions use of such an expansive list indicates instead that it is \nintended to apply to all.  \n61.  Compounding this expansive list of circumstances to which it may apply, the GISO \nProhibition uses a phrase that must ordinarily be given a very permissive meaning: โrelating to.โ  \n62.  Accordingly, the GISO Prohibition is violated if an activity falling within a listed \ncircumstance has merely a relation with or nexus to the prohibited concepts, without regard for the \ncloseness of that link or the intention of the persons engaging in the activity.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 20 of 177\n \n63.  The concepts prohibited by the GISO Prohibition are โgender identityโ and โsexual \norientation.โ The GISO Prohibition adopts the definition given these terms in the Iowa Civil Rights \nAct; as to โgender identityโ: โa gender-related identity of a person, regardless of the personโs \nassigned sex at birthโ; and, as to โsexual orientationโ: โactual or perceived heterosexuality, \nhomosexuality, or bisexuality.โ  The GISO Prohibition does not, on its face, distinguish between \nLGBTQ+ identities and orientations, and cisgender identities and heterosexual orientations. This \ntextual failing creates inconsistencies with other Iowa statutes recently passed by the legislature, \nincluding a requirement that sports teams be designated by gender and prohibits participation in \ngirls teams based on the studentโs sex assigned at birth (see Iowa Code ยง 261I.2(1)(a)โ(b)); as well \nas a โbathroom billโ that prohibits access to restrooms, changing areas, overnight accommodations, \nand other spaces based upon the studentโs sex assigned at birth (see Iowa Code ยง 280.33(1)โ(2)).  \n64.  Notwithstanding these otherwise neutral definitions of gender identity and sexual \norientation, State Defendants have taken the position in this litigation that an interpretation of the \nGISO Prohibition that would include within its scope cisgender identities and heterosexual \norientations would be absurd. State Defendants have articulated an interpretation of the GISO \nProhibition that applies only to LGBTQ+ identities and orientations, and subjects only the concepts \nof non-cisgender identity and non-heterosexual orientation to prohibition. For example, in giving \nan example of โmandatoryโ instruction that would violate the GISO Prohibition, State Defendants \nnoted an in-class reading of a book featuring gay or transgender characters.  \n65.  The GISO Prohibition also includes complications in application and enforcement \ndue to the grade levels chosen. Iowa schools do not uniformly, if even generally, designate \nbuildings solely for use by kindergarten through sixth grade; rather, it is common for sixth graders \nto attend either middle schools or junior highs along with students in grades seven or eight, thus \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 21 of 177\n \nsubjecting those students otherwise falling outside its restrictions to restraints on their activity to \nensure compliance as to the sixth graders in their presence.    \n66.  Unlike  the  Library  Restriction,  the  GISO  Prohibition  includes  no  separately \ndescribed enforcement mechanism. Instead, SF 496 makes its obligations a condition of a school \ndistrictโs accreditation. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (codified at Iowa Code ยง 256.11(2)(3)).   \n67.  Prior to the GISO Prohibition, many Iowa schools engaged in proactive efforts to \nsupport the inclusion, affirmation, and safety of students who were LGBTQ+ themselves or came \nfrom families with LGBTQ+ members. Among these efforts were the display of symbols or \nmessages of support for the LGBTQ+ community, sponsoring and facilitating LGBTQ+ student \ngroups, providing students with factual information on transgender and nonbinary gender identities \nin  response  to  or  to  protect  against  anti-transgender  bullying  and  harassment,  ensuring  the \navailability of books and materials that included LGBTQ+ representation alongside traditionally \nrepresented straight and cisgender characters, checking in with students to ensure they felt included \nand represented in class, and allowing student speech and conduct, including the preparation and \npresentation of classroom projects or assignments, on issues relating to LGBTQ+ identities, \norientations, and rights.  \n68.  Since the GISO Prohibition, these Iowa schools have eliminated or rolled back all \nsuch efforts and have instead taken steps to ensure issues relating to LGBTQ+ identities and \norientations are not acknowledged or addressed in the school or school-related environments. In \naddition to direct prohibitions on student speech, conduct, and association, this curtailment of \nLGBTQ+ inclusion and its consequent message of LGBTQ+ exclusion has chilled students and \nforced them to self-censor on topics related to their or their friendsโ and family membersโ LGBTQ+ \nidentity or orientation. In addition to the negative consequences this restriction on expression and \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 22 of 177\n \ndeprivation  of  information  has  had  on  these  studentsโ  educational  outcomes  and  emotional \nwellbeing, it has further put LGBTQ+ students at increased risk of anti-LGBTQ+ bullying and \nharassment.  \nThe Gender Identity Notification Provision \n69.  Finally, SF 496 includes a Gender Identity Notification Provision, which has been \nreferred to as a โforced outingโ provision. The Gender Identity Notification Provision forces \nschool officials to notify a studentโs parent or guardian whenever a student asks school officials to \nrespect the studentโs gender identity, even when the school has reason to believe that doing so will \nresult in imminent harm, homelessness, or abuse of the student at the hands of their parents or \nguardians. SF 496, Div. II, ยง 14 (Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3)).  \n70.  Specifically, the Gender Identity Notification Provision states: โIf a student . . . \nrequests an accommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs gender identity from a licensed \npractitioner employed by the school district,โ the licensed practitioner must โreport the studentโs \nrequest to an administrator,โ who then โshall report the studentโs request to the studentโs parent or \nguardian.โ Id.  \n71.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision includes only one example of what \nmight qualify as a requested โaccommodation,โ noting that this term is โincluding a request that \nthe licensed practitioner address the student using a name or pronoun that is different than the \nname or pronoun assigned to the student in the school districtโs registration forms or records.โ Id. \nAs  the  example  of  a  request  for  gender-affirming  names  or  pronouns  is  only  one  of  the \ncircumstances โinclud[ed]โ within its scope, the Gender Identity Notification Provision leaves \nsignificant room for other reportable requests.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 23 of 177\n \n72.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision does not include limiting language that \nwould exempt from its reporting obligation common expressions of a transgender or gender \nnonconforming studentโs gender identity, such as organizing a GSA and participating openly in its \nmeetings and events, and thus actions can necessitate a report home.  \n73.  As a GSAโs mission is to support free expression of LGBTQ+ identity and inclusion \nof LGBTQ+ persons by providing students with a safe environment to freely express themselves, \nfind support and community, access resources, and advocate for appropriate changes to school \npolicy, the Gender Identity Notification Provision thus necessarily impacts GSAsโ operations in \nways inapplicable to other student-led, noncurricular groups, in addition to its impact on the \nstudents themselves.  \n74.  Furthermore, the Gender Identity Notification Provision contains no exception for \nincidents  of  anti-LGBTQ  bullying  or  harassment.  Under  the  Gender  Identity  Notification \nProvision, a student who reports being bullied or harassed because of their transgender or gender \nnonconforming status must also expect they will be outed to their parents or guardians.  \n75.  Similarly, the Gender Identity Notification Provision contains no exception for \ndisclosures made while the student is receiving school-provided mental health counseling or social \nservices, regardless of the studentโs expectation of confidentiality or, indeed, the psychologistโs, \ncounselorโs, social workerโs, or nurseโs own ethical obligations. A student who privately reveals \ntheir gender identity to a trusted professional may be blindsided when that professional breaks \nconfidentiality to initiate a mandated report to the studentโs parents or guardians.  \n76.  The  Gender Identity Notification Provision requires that school districts, including \nDefendant School Districts, their administrators, and their employees, make this notification to \nparents and guardians regardless of the studentโs wishes or plans for sharing this information with \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 24 of 177\n \ntheir parents or guardians; regardless of whether a student will be rendered unsafe as a result; \nregardless of whether a student may have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality when \nspeaking with a school psychologist, counselor, social worker, or nurse; and regardless of ethical \nobligations these professionals may have to protect confidentiality. The law contains no process \nfor determining whether the studentโs safety or wellbeing will be threatened as result of such a \ndisclosure. It also does not contain any exception allowing for a school employee to avoid parental \nnotification when the employee already knows that such notification imminently will endanger the \nstudent.  \n77.  The enforcement mechanism for the Gender Identity Notification Provision is \nsimilar to the Library Restriction, in that an investigation and disciplinary procedure specific to \nthis provision has been added by SF 496. In short, the Department of Education is required to \nenforce this mandate by investigating potential violations and imposing disciplinary action ranging \nfrom written warnings to proceedings that could result in loss of licensure or certification.  (Iowa \nCode ยง 279.78(4)). As is the case with any violation of state law, upon disciplinary action, \nsuperintendents and school boards have the ability to terminate a teacher. See Iowa Code ยง \n279.27(1)โ(2). \n78.  Prior to the Gender Identity Notification Provision, Iowa educators, based on their \ntraining,  experience,  and  the  positive  impact  apparent,  would  endeavor  to  form  trusting \nrelationships with their students. With this trust in place, Iowa educators had greater insight into a \nstudentโs  emotional  wellbeing,  including  their  home  situation,  and  consequently  a  greater \nopportunity to address the challenges a student was facing in their academic performance. This \nrelationship further allowed educators to  fulfill their obligations as mandatory  reporters, as \nstudents felt comfortable seeking out these trusted adults for help with abuse at the hands of their \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 25 of 177\n \nparents or guardians. Separately, Iowa educators facilitated LGBTQ+ student groups and allowed \nopen discussion on issues relating to gender identity within them, to create a safe space for students \nto engage with each other and form support structures in the school environment. Facilitating such \ngroups  further  allowed  Iowa  educators  to  head  off  unsafe  or  inappropriate  behavior,  and \nadditionally provided the opportunity to encourage and provide guidance to transgender or gender \nnonconforming students in disclosing their gender identity at home.  \n79.  Since  the  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision,  Iowa  educators  have  been \nreluctant to form these bonds with students, given the risk that a student from a non-affirming \nhome environment could feel safeโand then betrayedโin revealing their gender identity to a \ntrusted educator. Students similarly have been reluctant to ask questions or share their struggles \nwith gender identity, effectively placing a wall between them and those with the obligation to \nreport them. Meanwhile, students from homes that are affirming of their gender identity have \nrefrained from engaging with or encouraging teacher engagement with fellow students believed to \nbe struggling with their gender identity in a non-affirming home environment, not wanting to put \neither the student at risk of abuse at home or the educator at risk of discipline in failing to make a \nrequired report. The Gender Identity Notification Requirement has thus forced students to engage \nin self-censorship, exposed them to domestic violence and homelessness, prevented them from \nforming or continuing a trusted a relationship with an adult teacher or advisor, increased the \nlikelihood of isolation and ostracization by peers, and undermined any expectation that they may \nhave had that their school environment would be a safe space for learning where teachers could \nhelp protect them from bullying or abuse. \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 26 of 177\n \nRulemaking and Policymaking \n80.  On November 15, 2023, Defendant ISBE issued proposed rules implementing SF \n496, including new enforcement mechanisms the law requires. Although the rulemaking purports \nto clarify aspects of SF 496, the proposed rules raise new questions and do not address the \nvagueness of the statutory language in any meaningful way.  \n81.  For example, the proposed rules purport to limit the definition of โage-appropriate,โ \nwhich the statute defines as excluding โany material with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex \nact,โ by adding, โA reference or mention of a sex act in a way that does not describe or visually \ndepict a sex act as defined in that section is not included in the previous sentence.โ Iowa State \nBoard of Education, Notice of Intended Action, Item 2 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.2) \n(hereinafter, โProposed Rulesโ).  \n82.  This proposed rule does not clarify when a โreferenceโ or โmention of a sex actโ \ndoes or does not qualify as โdescrib[ing]โ a โsex act.โ  \n83.  This proposed rule also does not explain whether enforcement turns on the brevity \nof the description, whether the description is merely implicit, the degree to which the description \nplays a role in a broader narrative, whether the average person would find the reference to appeal \nto the prurient interest, or take into account the literary, artistic, political, or scientific value of the \nwork. \n84.   The  proposed  rules  modify  the  enforcement  provisions  of  SF  496โs  Library \nRestriction by specifying that Defendant IDOE โmay exercise enforcement discretion if any \nviolation is voluntarily and permanently corrected prior to the department making a determination \nof a violation.โ Proposed Rules, Item 4 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.3(12)(d)(3)).  \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 27 of 177\n \n85.  This  enforcement  โdiscretion,โ  however,  is  merely  an  inducement  to  greater \ncurtailment of expression, inviting school districts to remove books in response to even a hint of \nan anonymous challenge, without ever having determined whether the specific text meets the \nstatute. \n86.  With respect to SF 496โs GISO Prohibition, the proposed rules add: โIn monitoring \nand enforcing this subrule, the department will not conclude that a neutral statement regarding \nsexual orientation or gender identity violates [the law].โ Proposed Rules, Item 5 (amending Iowa \nAdmin. Code r. 281-12.3(15)). \n87.  Far  from  clarifying  the  statute,  this  proposed rule  prompts  further  questions, \nhighlights, and doubles down on the impermissibly content-based and viewpoint-based nature of \nSF 496โs prohibitions. For example, what qualifies as a neutral statement about sexual orientation \nor gender identity? Would a GSA advisor violate the rule if she allowed sixth grade GSA members \nto meet to discuss the need for greater LGBTQ+ civil rights, but comply if students instead \nmentioned their sexual orientations incidentally while introducing themselves and discussed the \nlunch menu? Does a book in a fourth-grade classroom violate the rule if it portrays a childโs same-\nsex parents as loving and attentive, but comply if the reference to gay parents is merely an aside?3   \n88.  The proposed rules also fail to provide clarity to school districts with mixed K-12 \nlibrary programs or that use the local community library for their students. A proposed rule simply \ninstructs  these  districts  to  โexercise  reasonable,  physical,  administrative,  and  technological \ncontrols to ensure that materials accessible to students have access to age-appropriate materials \n \n3 Tom Barton and Caleb McCullough, Iowa Board of Education advances rules on school library \nrestrictions, The Gazette (Nov. 15, 2023), https://bit.ly/4eNRjTN (โThe rules allow for books to \nhave โneutralโ mentions of LGBTQ characters, [Thomas] Mayes [General Counsel for the Iowa \nDepartment of Education] said. This includes an โobservation regarding a book characterโs sexual \norientation or gender identity that stops short of being a promotion.โโ).  \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 28 of 177\n \nbased on their age and grade.โ Proposed Rules, Item 4 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-\n12.3(12)(d)(4)).  \n89.  The proposed rules also purport to explain school officialsโ obligation under SF \n496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision: โConcerning a studentโs request to use a name that \nis different from the name on the studentโs registration forms or records, that request is governed \nby this subrule only if the request is an accommodation intended to affirm a studentโs gender \nidentity.โ Proposed Rules, Item 5 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.3(16)(b)).  \n90.  This proposed subrule would require licensed practitioners to interrogate every \nstudent as to the purpose of their preferred name or nickname, imposing unique burdens on gender-\nnonconforming and transgender students forced to justify their own names. For example, under \nthis proposed subrule, school officials may acquiesce to a studentโs request to use โBobโ instead \nof โRobert,โ without triggering the reporting requirement, but they may have to report Samantha \nfor seeking to be referred to as โSamโ and would be required to report Susan for seeking to be \nreferred to as โSimon.โ  \n91.  Alternatively, a school district might reason that โgender identity,โ as defined by \nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act and incorporated into SF 496, includes cisgender identities, and any \nnickname might be understood to confirm a studentโs gender identity, whether that is transgender, \nnonbinary, gender non-conforming, or cisgender. Accordingly, Thomasโs request to go by Tom4 \nwould affirm his identity as a cisgender male.  \n92.  Unless an anti-LGBTQ+ intent is read into the law, the proposed subrule does \nnothing to clarify the scope of the Gender Identity Notification Provision. Further, the proposed \n \n4 See Barton and McCullough, supra note 5 (โFor example, โThomas to Tomโ is fine, Mayes \nsaid.โ). \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 29 of 177\n \nsubrule does not address the failure of the statute to identify other contexts and content that might \ntrigger reporting. The proposed subrule thus continues to encourage ad hoc implementation of the \nforced outing provision to any circumstance involving the expression of gender identity, including \nin GSA meetings and events. \n93.  The President of the Iowa State Education Association summarized the proposed \nrules as follows:  \nThe proposed rules do nothing to address the chilling effect the law \ncreated. So far, hundreds of book titles have been pulled from \nshelves across the state, and weโve created ridiculous amounts of \npaperwork over topics like student nicknames. Public education \nprofessionals will still continue to spend valuable instructional time \ntrying to meet vague state mandates.5 \n \n94.  During a preliminary injunction of the Library Restriction and GISO Prohibition \nprovisions of SF 496, State Defendants completed approval of the proposed rules on the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision as described.  See Iowa Admin.

In an effort to implement and maintain compliance with SF 496, School Board \nMember Defendants have separately adopted various new and revised policies intended to address \nthe Library Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provision.   \n98.  Iowa City Community School District Defendants have, since SF 496 was enacted, \nreviewed and updated, or are presently reviewing, policies entitled LGBTQ+ Guideline (102.G1), \nAnti-Bullying/Anti-Harassment (104), Title IX-Discrimination and Harassment Based on Sex \nProhibited  (106),  Student  Appearance  (502.1),  Student  Expression  and  Student  Publication \n(502.3), Student Expression and Student Publication Code (502.3R1), Student Disclosure of \nIdentity (503.7), Report of Student Disclosure of Identity (503.7E1), Request to Update Student \nIdentity (503.7E2), Student Organizations (504.2), Student Library Circulation Records (506.4), \nMulticultural/Gender Fair Education (603.4), and Objection to Instructional and Library Materials \n(605.3), as well as others impacted by or applying the provisions of SF 496.  \n99.  Sioux City Community School District Defendants have, since SF 496 was enacted, \nreviewed  and  updated  policies  entitled  Student  Library  Circulation  Records  (506.4)  and \nReconsideration of Library Materials (604.72), as well as others impacted by or applying the \nprovisions of SF 496.  \n100.

School District Defendantsโ policies have, as with State Defendantsโ rulemaking, \nfailed to resolve the inherent vagueness of the Library Restriction and GISO Prohibition, failed to \nprotect the First Amendment rights of School District Defendantsโ students infringed upon by the \nLibrary Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provision, and, in many \ncases, rolled back preexisting protections for LGBTQ+ students in an effort to apply and comply \nwith these provisions of SF 496.  \nLegislative History of SF 496 \n104.  The landscape of Iowa law before the passage of SF 496, along with the lawโs \nlegislative history, underscore that SF 496 was not enacted for any legitimate purpose and \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 32 of 177\n \ndemonstrate that SF 496 is an attempt to target LGBTQ+ students and prescribe what shall be \northodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion in Iowa schools. \n105.  Prior  to  SF  496,  Iowa  law  contained  numerous  protections  for  students  that \nprotected them from exposure to harmful materials in school.  \n106.  Iowa law prohibited the dissemination of obscene material to minors and the \nadmission of minors to premises where obscene material is exhibited. See Iowa Code ยง 728.2, \n728.3.  \n107.  Iowa law also provided for the creation and oversight of appropriate, supportive \nschool library programs. See 281 Iowa Admin. Code r. 12.3(12)(a)โ(c).  \n108.  And Iowa law required each school district to adopt policies to address the selection \nand reconsideration of school libraries. See 281 Iowa Admin. Code r. 12.3(12)(c).  \n109.  Despite  these  pre-existing  protections  for  Iowa  students,  the  2022  legislative \nsession opened with comments from Iowa State Senator Jake Chapman accusing โsomeโ teachers \nof a โsinister agendaโ to โnormalize sexually deviant behaviorโ and describing an โattack on our \nchildren [that] is no longer hidden.โ6 \n110.  Shortly thereafter, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds appeared for an interview and \nwas asked about Senator Chapmanโs comments. Governor Reynolds responded, โIf youโre talking \nabout, do I think inappropriate things are being displayed in libraries, and in classrooms, across \nthe state? From what Iโve heard from parents, I absolutely agree with that.โ7  \n \n6 Iowa senator criticized for comments about Iowa teachers, KCCI 8 Des Moines (updated Jan. \n11, 2022, 6:22 PM CST), https://tinyurl.com/4mszm4za.  \n7 James Stratton, Iowa Gov: โI donโt think thatโs appropriateโ: Context and controversy behind \nbook  challenged  in  Iowa,  KCCI  8  Des  Moines  (updated  Jan.  24,  2022,  10:21  AM  CST \nhttps://tinyurl.com/2zah6wn2.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 33 of 177\n \n111.  During the interview, Governor Reynolds proceeded to read a passage from All \nBoys Arenโt Blue, a young adult memoir by writer and LGBTQ+ activist George M. Johnson, \ncalling it โrated Rโ and suggesting it was inappropriate to teach as part of the curriculum for K-12 \neducation and include in school libraries. At the time, the book was subject to challenge in certain \nschool districts. \n112.  Legislative action directed at LGBTQ+ expression in Iowa public schools became \na priority of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds for the 2023 legislative session. \n113.  On February 2, 2023, Governor Reynolds promoted legislation targeting LGBTQ+ \nstudents and their identities at a town hall meeting hosted by Moms for Liberty8 and the Leadership \nInstitute.9 The meeting began with an invocation praying for strength in โthe battle taking place \nfor our childrenโs minds.โ10  \n114.  At the meeting, Governor Reynolds described her goal โto restore sanityโ through \nthe legislation, explaining there exists an โextreme and extremely loud minority,โ trying to \nโindoctrinate our children,โ that thinks โpornographic library books are education.โ11 \n115.  A week later, on February 9, 2023, Governor Reynoldsโs legislation was introduced \nin the Iowa Senate as Senate Study Bill 1145. An identical House Study Bill was introduced on \n \n8  The  Southern  Poverty  Law  Center  (SPLC)  describes  Moms  for  Liberty  as  โa  far-right \norganization that engages in anti-student inclusion activities and self-identifies as part of the \nmodern  parental  rights  movement.โ  SPLC,  Moms  for  Liberty,  https://tinyurl.com/3v2eczw3 \n(accessed Oct. 17, 2024).

During the session, the bill emerged from House and Senate committees as Senate \nFile 496, and underwent substantial amendments and refinements, which reinforced its anti-\nLGBTQ+ priorities and goals.  \n117.  The initial bill proposed a notification and right to opt out of โany activity or \ninstruction that involves obscene material or sexually explicit material.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16; H.S.B. \n222, ยง 16. To that end, the initial version also proposed the creation of a โcomprehensive listโ of \nany book removed by a school board of directors. S.S.B. 1145, ยงยง 1, 14; H.S.B. 222, ยงยง 1, 14. The \nbill defined those restricted materials by (a) the definition of obscenity in existing Iowa Code,12  \nand (b) a new, narrow definition of โsexually explicitโ materials.13 In order for material to be \nsexually explicit, it had to not only be โoffensiveโ and โprurient,โ but also โlack[] serious literary, \nartistic, political, or scientific value as to minors.โ14 The final bill jettisoned any reference to \nobscenity or that termโs familiar factorsโsuch as taking the work as a whole, judging it by \ncontemporary community standards, or assessing its intended appealโand abandoned the term \nโsexually explicit,โ  opting  instead for the  blanket prohibition  of materials  that include  any \n \n12 See  Iowa Code ยง 728.1(5) (โany material  depicting or describing the genitals, sex  acts, \nmasturbation, excretory functions or sadomasochistic abuse which the average person, taking the \nmaterial as a whole and applying contemporary community standards with respect to what is \nsuitable material for minors, would find appeals to the prurient interest and is patently offensive; \nand the material, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, scientific, political or artistic valueโ). \n13 โSexually explicitโ materials were defined as material thatโ(1) [t]aken as a whole with respect \nto minor children, the material appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion,โ โ(2) \n[t]he material depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is \nsuitable for minor children, a sex act or lewd exhibition of the genitals,โ  and โ(3) [t]aken as a \nwhole, the material lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors,โ which \nwould be deemed met โif the material contains material described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) \nwhen substantially similar material is readily available to minor childrenโ without such material \nโbut that conveys a substantially similar message or viewpoint.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16. \n14 Id. \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 35 of 177\n \nโdescription or visual depiction of a sex act.โ Any attempt to limit the scope of the Library \nRestriction would be rejected, including the Iowa Houseโs suggestion to prohibit only โgraphic \ndescriptionsโ of a sex act. Amendment H-1173 to S.F. 496, 90th Leg. Sess. Div. V ยง 10.19a(1) (as \nadopted by IA House, Apr. 4, 2023). \n118.  Moreover, the final billโs Library Restriction was expressly amended to carve-out \nthe Bible from the billโs effect. An Iowa Senator asked on the Senate floor whether a book \ncontaining โgang rape,โ โserial incest,โ and an โact of masturbationโ would meet the billโs \ndefinition of โage appropriate.โ The Senate sponsor correctly identified the referenced book as the \nBible,15 and suggested that a school board that โdecides to remove the Bible . . . might have to put \nup with the wrath of a few parents.โ  After the inquiring senator noted that existing Iowa law \nactually prohibits the exclusion of the Bible from public schools, the bill was amended again to \nexclude religious texts from its scope.16  \n119.  In the initial bill, although the term โsexual activityโ was present and had the same \ndefinition โsex actโ does in the final bill (by reference to Iowaโs criminal law), the term applied \nonly to prohibit content in K-3 instruction.17   \n120.  The final billโs Library Restriction expanded the prohibition from grades K-3 \n(about ages 5-9) to all grades K-12 (ages 5-18), and redirected the use of the term โsex actโ to ban \n \n15Senate Video (2023-03-22),  90th  IA S. Sess.  73rd  Day at  6:35:39 PM, (Mar.  22, 2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4dpsfzhh (quoting exchange between Sen. Quirmbach and Sen. Rozenboom); \nsee generally Genesis 19:32-26, 38:8-9; Judges 19:24-29. \n16 See Iowa Code ยง 280.6 (โReligious books such as the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran shall not \nbe excluded from any public school or institution in the state . . . .โ). \n17 S.S.B. 1145, ยง 13 (prohibiting any โprogram, curriculum, material, test, survey, questionnaire, \nactivity, announcement, promotion, or instruction of any kind relating to gender identity or \nsexual activity to students in kindergarten through grade threeโ and defining โsexual activityโ as \nโthe same as defined in section 702.17โ). \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 36 of 177\n \nlibrary books and other materials.  \n121.  Similarly,  although  both  the  initial  bill  and  final  bill  prohibit  materials  and \ninstruction related to gender identity, that prohibition applied only to grades K-3 in the initial bill. \nAnd despite targeting gender identity from its inception, SF 496 did not expressly target sexual \norientation. Instead, the initial bill only targeted only sexual โactivityโ related to K-3 instruction. \n122.  The final billโs GISO Prohibition expanded the restriction on content related to \ngender identity to include grades 4-6 as well. The final bill also substituted in the term โsexual \norientationโ for โsexual activity,โ and like with gender identity, expanded the restriction from \napplying only to grades K-3 to applying to grades K-6.  \n123.  This legislative history shows a conflation of content concerning sexual activity \nand content related to LGBTQ+ identities and people. By conflating the two, the final bill \nsexualizes  LGBTQ+  identities  and  people,  portraying  them  as  predatory,  inappropriate  for \ndiscussion in school, and unworthy of dignity, recognition, and respect. SF 496 communicates that \nLGBTQ+ children and adults are unspeakable and shameful, simply by virtue of who they are. \n124.  Finally, in the initial version of the bill, the triggering event for the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision was an employeeโs โreasonabl[e] belie[f] that the minor child has expressed \na gender identity that is different than the biological sex listed on the minor childโs official birth \ncertificate.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16. After the billโs opponents criticized the potential reach and \nambiguity in the language, the Senate sponsor countered, โWe all know what weโre talking about \nhere.โ18  The  language  was  changed  to  trigger  reporting  on  a  studentโs  โrequestโ  for  โan \naccommodation.โ  \n \n18 Senate video (2023-03-22), supra note 17, at 6:46:42 PM (quoting IA Sen. Rozenboom). \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 37 of 177\n \n125.  The final billโs Gender Identity Notification Provision also was amended to remove \na safety measure. If the school determined that the notification โwas likely to lead to a case of child \nabuse,โ the school was required to report its โsafety concerns to the department of health and \nhuman services so that the department may determine whether the minor child is a child in need \nof assistanceโ under Iowa law, i.e., proceedings to determine whether the child should be removed \nfrom the home. S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16; see generally Iowa Code ยงยง 232.96A(1)โ(17), .102(1)โ(10). \nThis apparent acknowledgment of the risks the legislation posed to children with parents or \nguardians that are not accepting or affirming of their identity ultimately was removed to ensure \nthe severe consequences of reporting fall only upon the targeted students.  \n126.  Throughout the legislative process, legislators opposing the bill spoke out on what \nthey saw as a โhatefulโ19 bill โpromoting ignorance and intolerance . . . about people who are \ndifferent than themselves.โ20 Others identified the bill as setting up โtwo tiers of kids in school: \nkids with a government approved identity or a government approved family, and kids who are \nforced  to  live  in  silent  shadow,โ and  predicted  it  would  lead  to  โdisruption,  bullying,  and \nprejudice.โ21 On books, opponents saw the bill sending the โmessage that certain topics are taboo \nor shameful,โ even though โbooks that discuss sex can play a critical role in promoting empathy \nand understanding for those with different experiences and identities,โ effectively โden[ying] kids \nthe opportunity to learn and grow.โ22 Others noted the new definition of โage appropriateโ would \ncapture award-winning books that โhave already been vetted from the Department of Ed. on \n \n19 Senate video (2023-04-19), supra note 2, at 6:34:12 PM (quoting IA Sen.

Nevertheless, proponents maintained the bill was necessary, citing an unspecified \nโmountain of evidence that many Iowa libraries contain books that do provide sexually explicit \nand obscene pictures and narratives that many Iowa parents find objectionable.โ25 Proponents also \nclaimed that students have โcome home with books that are literally pornography.โ26 By way of \nexample,  one  Iowa  Senator  identified  Gender  Queer:  A  Memoir  by  Maia  Kobabe,  an \nautobiographical graphic novel about the authorโs journey of self-identity as a nonbinary, asexual \nperson, which the Senator described as โdisgusting.โ27  \n128.  But SF 496 does not ban only Gender Queer, whose intended audience is teenagers, \nit alsoโon its faceโbans books like Melissa by Alex Gino, which does not contain a โsex actโ \nand has been removed and restricted pursuant the GISO Prohibition solely for telling the story of \na transgender girl.  \n129.  Ultimately, however, proponents decided the bill was necessary โdue to schools \npushing wokismโ28 and because it is โwrong to push political agendas in the classroom.โ29  \n130.

IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS serves a network of chapter member GSAs, which are \nstudent-led organizations and noncurricular clubs within schools that focus on providing a safe \nspace  for  LGBTQ+  youth,  address  anti-LGBTQ+  harassment  and  discrimination,  promote \ninclusion, offer support to students, and educate people about sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.  \n132.  IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS serves its member GSAs in multiple ways, providing \nguidance to members forming new GSAs and supporting their goals throughout the school year, \nincluding individualized support in on-site visits, workshops, connections to other network GSAs \nand access to several annual events, and written resources on issues relevant to operating a GSA \nand supporting and advocating for LGBTQ+ youth.  \n133.  IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS also serves individual student members and groups of \nstudents who are not yet members of a GSA, including by providing resources and consultation \non forming GSAs, materials and victim service information regarding bullying, and all other \nbenefits of the GSA Network, such as access to events and scholarship opportunities. These \nstudents are part of the IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS GSA network regardless of whether they are \nmembers of an active GSA. In other words, numerous GSAs and individual LGBTQ+ students \nthroughout Iowa are members of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 40 of 177\n \n134.  SF 496 chills students from associating for the purpose of expressing themselves, \nadvocating for equality for LGBTQ+ students, and providing mutual support and community.  \n135.  IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS serves at least 4,000 students, representing more than 100 \nmember GSAs in school districts across the state.  \n136.  The law has caused school districts across the state to restrict the activities of \nmember GSAs within IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs GSA network and has forced some member \nGSAs to close altogether.  \n137.  School districts have prohibited IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs member GSAs from \ndisplaying signs or promoting the club in classrooms or hallways where students younger than \nseventh graders may be present, even in schools that include eighth or ninth graders, and even \nthough other noncurricular clubs are not subject to the same restrictions. The GISO Prohibition of \nSF 496 is cited as the source for this restriction. For example, the administration at Mount Vernon \nMiddle School would not allow the schoolโs GSAโan IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS memberโto \nadvertise in the public areas of hallways, such as on studentsโ lockers, in areas where 5th and 6th \ngrade  students  are  able  to  see.  On  information  and  belief,  no  other  noncurricular  student \norganization at Mount Vernon Middle School, or any other school with mixed populations of \nstudents above and below 6th grade, was subject to this restriction. \n138.  At other schools with students at or below 6th grade, the GISO Prohibition has \nforced them to close. For example, one advisor for a member GSA in the College Community \nSchool District informed an IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS staff person, โWith us being a 5th/6th \nbuilding, we will not be able to run our GSA this year due to the new legislation.โ \n139.  Other advisors for IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS member GSAs have pointed to the \nlawโs Gender Identity Notification Provision as the cause of restrictions and/or closure of GSAs. \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 41 of 177\n \nStudents and faculty members alike are confused about what speech during a GSA meeting could \ntrigger a report home, whether merely attending a meeting is sufficient, and how to handle other \nsituations that may arise in an open group discussion. Faculty members who previously sponsored \nstudent-led GSA chapters now are reluctant to do so for fear of being required to out student \nmembers as a result of the law, forcing these chapter members of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS to \nradically alter the way they conduct meetings, or even to close. For many member GSAs under SF \n496, particularly those with student members who have not yet come out to their parents or \nguardians about their gender identity, the GSA cannot be a safe and open space if a teacher advisor \nis present, as that advisorโs presence could put the students at risk of being outed before they are \nready. As a result, these advisors must either withdraw from the GSA meetings and activities or \ndecline to serve, in either event to the significant detriment of their GSAโs members.  \n140.  For  example,  as  a  result  of  the  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision,  the \nadministration at Mount Vernon Middle School has not allowed its GSA, a member of IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLSโs GSA network, to have a faculty sponsor present in the room during meetings. \nThat prohibition caused the GSAโs president, F.J., considerable difficulty in running the meetings. \nThe presence of an adult authority figure in the room is important to the orderly conduct of a \nmeeting full of teens and pre-teens, and F.J., then an eighth grader, struggled to keep the group \nfocused on its mission of providing a supportive and inclusive space for students to share their \nexperiences. On information and belief, no other student organization at Mount Vernon Middle \nSchool is subject to this restriction.  \n141.  At schools where an IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS member GSA has continued to meet \nwith a faculty member present, SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision has prevented \nstudents who are not out to their parents or guardians from joining, reducing the membership of \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 42 of 177\n \nthe GSAs and thus interfering with the remaining GSA membersโ ability to meet their group goals. \nAlthough many individual student members of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS are openly LGBTQ+ and \nout to their parents or guardians, others have not yet come out to their parents or guardians. Some \nstudent members of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS who are not yet out to their parents or guardians \nparticipate in active member GSAs. But since SF 496 took effect, they do so only in a limited way, \nsuch as without disclosing their names and openly engaging in discussion when a faculty sponsor \nis in earshot for fear of being outed. These limitations impede the ability of student members of \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS to participate meaningfully in the GSA, frustrating the GSAโs goals and \nlessening their fellow membersโ experience in the GSA. Other student members of IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS who are not out to their parents or guardians and who previously participated in a GSA \nno longer participate because they fear being outed. Due to SF 496, member GSAs of IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS have been forced to close or have otherwise been restricted in their ability to meet and \nconduct GSA activities on the same terms as other student-led, noncurricular groups.    \n142.  Before the passage of SF 496, Plaintiff A.C. attended meetings of the GSA at her \nschoolโa member GSA of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโas a third grader. The purpose of these \nmeetings was to build community among the LGBTQ+ students as a result of SF 496โs GISO \nProhibition, Defendant IOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT ceased GSAs for \nkindergarten  through  sixth  grades.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendant  IOWA  CITY \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT did not similarly prohibit any other student group in K-6 \nschools. A.C. and other LGBTQ+ students at her school are not able to attend GSA meetings.  \n143.  SF 496 has interfered with Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs ability to enjoy his GSA. The Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision has caused the number of members of the Waterloo West High \nSchool GSAโanother member GSA of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโto dwindle, as students now \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 43 of 177\n \nfear being outed to unsupportive family members and increased bullying and harassment from \npeers. Even among members, engagement has declined due to these fears from the law, making it \ndifficult to fill leadership roles and organize GSA activities. Waterloo West High Schoolโs GSA \nis a happy space that should be accessible to all interested LGBTQ+ students, but SF 496 interferes \nwith studentsโ ability to create a supportive community for each other. On information and belief, \nstudents and members of other student-led groups in Defendant WATERLOO COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICT have not experienced such challenges and harms.  \n144.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE is active in his schoolโs GSAโa member GSA of IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLSโand knows fellow students who would like to join the GSA but will not \nbecause they are afraid of facing hostility at home if they are outed by SF 496โs requirements. \nLGBTQ+ studentsโ reluctance to join the GSA diminishes DOEโs own experience of community \nin the GSA. DOE also knows students who are afraid to use the name and pronoun that match their \ngender identities, because SF 496 will cause school officials to out these students to unsupportive \nparents or guardians, and they will face negative consequences at home. Students remain worried \nthat even the GSA sponsor might be required to out them to their parents. Additionally, DOE states \nthat the school also supports some student groups in holding events for the public or attending \nevents or competitions relevant to the group around the state, but his GSA has never received \nspecial funding to host or attend events like those put on by Iowa Safe Schools. \n145.   JAMES DOE feels that SF 496 has created a climate of fear that prevents students \nfrom coming together to support each other and express a common message of pride in who they \nare. For example, this has manifested in an incident of anti-LGBTQ harassment, when posters \nfeaturing pride flags posted by the GSA were torn down. Due to SF 496, even among the few \nmembers  of  the  JAMES  DOEโs  GSA,  engagement  with  group  activities  has  substantially \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 44 of 177\n \ndecreased, placing a larger burden on a few members to accomplish the GSAโs goals. The \nconditions for the GSA under SF 496 are such that the GSAโs leadership, including JAMES DOE, \nare considering โrebrandingโ to a general activism club, allowing the group to support LGBTQ+ \nwithout being as visibly an LGBTQ+ group.  On information and belief, students and members of \nother student-led groups in Defendant SIOUX CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT have \nnot experienced such challenges and harms.  \n146.  These examples highlight myriad local rules, customs, and practices schools have \ndeveloped surrounding the Gender Identity Notification Provision and GISO Prohibition. They \nhave  adopted  rules  or  practices  that  prohibit  GSAs  in  the  K-6  environment  and  limit \nadvertisements of the GSAs in public places that other student groups may access. Students have \nseen  pride  flags  and  safe  space stickers  removed.  Schools  have  had  to  develop  ad  hoc \nunderstandings of what constitutes a โrequestโ for an โaccommodationโ โrelated toโ โgender \nidentity,โ as well as when and how the rules are to be implemented. For example, at one middle \nschool, students in the GSA were instructed to only use their last names when referring to \nthemselves and others in front of their faculty advisor, to avoid potentially triggering the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision. On information and belief, no other student groups require such \nlimitations on speech or expression. At another middle school GSA, students in 7th and 8th grade \nare forced to obtain parental permission to join the GSA, and 5th and 6th graders are barred from \njoining at all. On information and belief, no other student groups require parental permission for \nmere participation, nor do they bar students in 5th and 6th grade from attending. Such practices \nhave effectively forced teachers to avoid or limit their participation as GSA faculty sponsors, and \nsome GSAs have shrunk or disappeared entirely as a result. SF 496 has interfered with individual \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 45 of 177\n \nstudentsโ rights to assemble and student GSAs abilities to function in ways that cannot be \noverstated.  \n147.  As a result of SF 496, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS has expended significant resources \neducating its member students and GSAs on the lawโs impact and helping its member GSAs simply \nto avoid closure. Those are resources that IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS would otherwise spend on its \nordinary course of helping GSAs to flourish and providing resources to students. \n148.  Rather than taking advantage of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ core programming on \nleadership  and  organizational  skills,  student  members  and  member  GSAs  of  IOWA  SAFE \nSCHOOLS since SF 496 have been far more in need of guidance navigating Iowa law. While \nprevious visits to member GSAs by IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA coordinator would focus on \ngroup goal setting, visits after SF 496 were almost exclusively dedicated to reviewing SF 496 and \nassessing whether the student membersโ schools were overextending its provisions. Instead of \nimproving program leadership resources over the summer as its employees would typically have \ndone, employees were devoted to developing guidance regarding SF 496, preparing for teacher \nadvisor Q&A sessions concerning the law, and responding to direct inquiries about the lawโs \nimpact on member GSAs.  \n149.  GSAs are critical resources for LGBTQ+ studentsโ mental and physical well-being, \nand academic success. GSAs assist LGBTQ+ students in seeking or forming friendships, networks, \nfinding community, exploring their identity, and engaging with school resources or activism. Such \nsupportive relationships promote self-esteem, sense of purpose, and adjustment for LGBTQ+ \nstudents, which can be particularly important for LGBTQ+ students who experience rejection or \ndiscomfort  from  their  families.  GSA  participation  is  associated  with  higher  GPAs,  greater \nlikelihood  of  graduating,  and  greater  community  involvement.  Conversely,  when  LGBTQ+ \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 46 of 177\n \nstudents do not have access to supportive resources or meaningful peer networks, they are less \nlikely to succeed academically. \n150.  GSA activities can promote tolerance, respect, and inclusion for LGBTQ youth, \nprovide a space for advocacy and education, and help teachers better advocate for their students. \nLGBTQ+ students at schools with active GSAs hear fewer anti-LGBTQ remarks, are less likely to \nfeel unsafe due to their identities, experience lass severe victimization, and are less likely to miss \nschool for reasons of feeling unsafe or uncomfortable. Students in educational environments that \ndo not have these structures in place, by contrast, report greater isolation, withdrawal, and open \nhostility  from  classmates  and  school  employees.  By  causing  the  closure  of  certain  GSAs, \nrestrictions on the activities of others, and chilling student participation, SF 496 has harmed \nPlaintiffs A.C., P.B.-P., DOE, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, and its student members and GSA chapter \nmembers. \n151.   IOWA  SAFE  SCHOOLS  also  provides  professional  development,  licensure \nrenewal, and graduate credits to educators individually and district-wide, in the past reaching over \n4,000 educators annually. These services are offered through in-person presentations and direct \nconsultation with client school districts, an online Iowa Safe Schools Academy hosting coursework \nand seminars for educators, and large conferences and symposiums for educators to attend with \ntheir colleagues.  \n152.  IOWA  SAFE  SCHOOLSโ  professional  development  services  are  designed  to \nsupport its core mission of providing a safe, supportive, and nurturing learning environment and \ncommunity for LGBTQ+ youth and their allies.  \n153.  With respect to direct consultation programs, school districts contract with IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLS to have an IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS employee meet with educators one-on-one \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 47 of 177\n \nand present to them in group settings, such as during teacher in-service days, on issues related to \nbetter understanding and meeting the needs of LGBTQ+ kids. Common topics include โLGBTQ \n101,โ how to build support systems for LGBTQ+ youth and their allies, how to build empathy \namong students on issues face by LGBTQ+ youth, and understanding and respecting studentsโ \npronouns.   \n154.  With respect to licensure renewal and graduate credit offerings, IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS maintains an online service, the Iowa Safe Schools Academy, which offers a variety \nof classes focusing on how best to support different student groups in classrooms, including \nLGBTQ+ students, and set them up for acceptance and success. Educators pay a fee to take these \ncourses.  \n155.  With  respect  to  conferences  and  symposiums,  IOWA  SAFE  SCHOOLS  has \nhistorically held three per year: the Engage and Empower Summit in the fall, the Trans Education \nSummit in the winter, and the Anti-Violence Symposium in the spring. As indicated by their titles, \nthese conferences and symposiums are an opportunity for educators to expand their knowledge \nand skills in the area of LGBTQ+ inclusion and safety, and thus better support their students. \nAttendees pay an attendance fee and various sponsors pay fees to support the event.  \n156.  Since SF 496, there has been a sharp decline in participation across IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLSโ  professional  development  services,  frustrating  its  mission.  Educators  and \nadministrators have cancelled existing engagements and rejected additional services because they \nbelieve the GISO Prohibition prohibits their engagement with LGBTQ+-affirming content or the \nGender Identity Notification Provision prohibits their implementation of its lessons without \nputting themselves and their students at risk. Since SF 496, only two school districts have taken \nadvantage of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ direct consultation programs, the number of registrants \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 48 of 177\n \nfor Iowa Safe Schools Academy courses has been cut in half, and IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS has \nbeen forced to cancel both the Engage and Empower Summit and the Anti-Violence Symposium \ndue to lack of attendance. This decline represents a direct harm to IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ \nfunding.  \n157.  Further due to SF 496, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS has been forced to modify the \ncontent of its professional development services substantially. SF 496 has diverted the time of \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS employees to revising the content of its professional development \nofferings and responding to educatorsโ questions on the law and its applicability. SF 496 has shifted \nthe focus of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ direct consultation programs, online coursework, and \nconferences from its core mission of building out systems and policies to support LGBTQ+ \nstudents and their allies to identifying what permissible supports remain under the law and \nnavigating school policy implementing the law.  \n158.  SF 496 has further frustrated IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ mission of supporting \nLGBTQ+ students and their allies in the K-12 setting, as it has been forced to redirect professional \ndevelopment services to colleges and employers, in an effort to support LGBTQ+ youth and their \nallies after high school graduation and to make up for the loss of K-12 educators and school \nengagement.  \n159.  Outside of professional development services, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS partners \nwith local nonprofits to provide programming and events that reach additional students, families, \nand educators. As with professional development services, SF 496 has created a need for IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLS to modify its programming and events to respond to concerns of students, \nfamilies, and educators on the impacts of the law.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 49 of 177\n \n160.  In summary, SF 496 has imposed unique harms and burdens on IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLSโs member GSAs, prevented some IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS student members from \njoining a GSA or participating openly in a GSA, correspondingly interfered with the enjoyment of \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student members remaining in GSA, caused IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS \nto expend significant resources on supporting GSAs in navigating the law and avoiding closure, \nsubstantially decreased school and educator engagement with IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ paid \nprofessional development services, required IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS to modify its professional \ndevelopment services and community programming to respond to concerns relating to the law, and \nrequired IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS staff to shift from its core focus of enhancing the experience of \nLGBTQ+ youth and their allies to responding to concerns and questions surrounding the law.   \nSF 496 Caused Chaos and Confusion and Deprived Plaintiff Students  \nof Access to Books Based on Content and Viewpoint \n161.  Although the Governor signed SF 496 into law in May, Iowa schools had virtually \nno guidance on how to comply with the law when the 2023-2024 school year started. And the \nproposed guidance they recently have received is of no utility, because it provides no greater \nspecificity or clarity than the statute itself. Administrators, teachers, parents, and students are \nconfused about how to comply with SF 496. Teachers and administrators across the state have \nexpressed panic and anxiety about how to implement the law. School districts across the state have \ncirculated and banned widely diverging lists of books and other materials from school classrooms \nand libraries. \n162.  Many of the books that Iowa school districts have banned are books by LGBTQ+ \nauthors, such as All Boys Arenโt Blue by George M. Johnson, which chronicles the authorโs journey \ngrowing up as a queer Black man in New Jersey and Virginia.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 50 of 177\n \n163.  Many banned books also contain content of particular relevance to LGBTQ+ \nstudents,  including  LGBTQ+  characters,  historical  figures,  or  themes.  These  books  include \nMelissa (winner of the Stonewall Award for Childrenโs and Young Adult Literature, California \nBook Award for Juvenile (Gold), and Lambda Literary Award for Childrenโs/Young Adult)30  by \nAlex Gino; Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe; Brave Face by Shaun David Hutchinson; \nThe Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller; and This Book is Gay by Juno Dawson.  \n164.  Similarly, many banned books are by authors of color, or contain content centering \nthe narratives of Black, Brown, or Indigenous people. See, e.g., The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison; \nThe Color Purple by Alice Walker; Black Girl Unlimited by Echo Brown; Native Son by Richard \nWright; When I Was Puerto Rican by Esmeralda Santiago; Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur; and The \nAbsolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie (winner of the National Book \nAward for Young Peopleโs Literature, Odyssey Award, Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for \nFiction, and California Young Readers Medal for Young Adult)31.  \n165.  On information and belief, in response to SF 496, Defendant URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT initially marked hundreds of books to be banned from \nUrbandale school libraries.32 The list included 1984 (winner of the Prometheus Hall of Fame \n \n30 Melissa, Goodreads, https://bit.ly/4dODOll (last visited Oct. 17, 2024) \n31 The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Goodreads, https://bit.ly/3U94SoA (last \nvisited Oct. 17, 2024). \n32 Nearly 400 titles on reported banned book list at Urbandale Schools, KCCI 8 Des Moines (July \n31, 2023); Chris Higgins, Iowa school district flags 374 books as potentially banned, from \nโUlyssesโ  to  โHeartstopper,โ  Des  Moines  Register  (updated  6:15  PM  CT,  July  31,  2023), \nhttps://bit.ly/4f2Utm4.

See Appendix A \n(the  list  of  books  Defendant  URBANDALE  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  initially \nidentified for removal).  \n166.  In a statement, Defendant URBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT \ninitially defended the list, explaining, โWe had to take a fairly broad interpretation of the law \nknowing that if our interpretation was too finite, our teachers and administrators could be faced \nwith disciplinary actions according to the new law.โ35 \n167.  After  publication  of  the  list  and  public  outcry,  Defendant  URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT reduced the number of books banned from libraries and \nclassrooms to 51, largely by assuming for the time being that the GISO Prohibition does not require \nbanning  books  related  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  from  school  libraries.36  The \nshortened list, however, still includes titles such as Gender Queer: A Memoir (winner of the ALA \nAlex Award)37 by Maia Kobabe; Beloved (winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, American Book \nAward, Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and Frederic G. Melcher Book Award)38 by Toni Morrison; \n \n33 Michael Grossberg, Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, Newspeak & memory holes: \nGeorge Orwellโs Nineteen Eighty-Four, a 1984 Prometheus Hall of fame winner for Best Fiction, \nPrometheus Blog (July 30, 2020), https://bit.ly/405FS59. \n34 The Color Purple, Goodreads, https://bit.ly/4dS5dTm, (last visited Oct. 17, 2024). \n35 Phillip Sitter, Urbandale schools pause removing books referencing gender identity, sexual \norientation, Des Moines Register (updated 11:44 AM CT, Aug. 4, 2023), https://bit.ly/4eLpsnf. \n36 Id. \n37 American Library Association, 2020 Alex Award Winners, https://bit.ly/3YqlGd7 (last visited \nOct. 17, 2024). \n38 Beloved, Goodreads, https://bit.ly/3YrejSy (last visited Oct. 17, 2024). \n51 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 52 of 177\n \nLike a Love Story by Abdi Nazemian; and Call Me By Your Name (Lambda Literary Award for \nGay Fiction)39 by Andre Aciman.

On information and belief, Mason City Community School District used ChatGPT \nto identify a list of books that purportedly depict sex acts and pulled 19 books from school \nshelves.40 See Appendix C (the list of books Mason City Community School District identified for \nremoval). Also, on information and belief, Ankeny Community School District has eliminated \naccess to books for students in kindergarten through sixth grade, including All Are Welcome by \nAlexandra Penfold, and Pink Is for Boys by Robb Pearlman.  \n169.  Defendant IOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT circulated a list of \n67 books for removal, including Brave Face by Shaun David Hutchinson; All Boys Arenโt Blue by \nGeorge M. Johnson; and Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out (winner of the 2015 \nFlora Stieglitz Straus award)41 by Susan Kuklin. See Appendix D (the list of books Defendant \nIOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT identified for removal). \n170.  Defendant WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS circulated a list of 47 \nbooks for removal, including Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe; Lawn Boy (winner of \nthe ALA Alex Award)42 by Jonathan Evison; and Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut.

Overall, at least 3,400 books have been removed from Iowa schools.43 \n172.  By targeting these books for removal from Iowa schools and depriving students of \naccess to these materials based on their content and viewpoint, Defendants have prevented \nmarginalized students such as LGBTQ+ young people from seeing themselves reflected in the \nstories collected in their classrooms and libraries. Plaintiff Students are denied the comfort of \nnarratives that include LGBTQ+ characters and the solace that they are not alone. \n173.  Plaintiff T.S. found meaning in the book Rick by Alex Gino, which chronicles the \nstruggles of a gender nonconforming boy who finds support at a GSA meeting. T.S. has long hoped \nto read the book Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe, but never got around to doing so \nbefore  passage  of  SF  496.  Because  Defendant  URBANDALE  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL \nDISTRICT has banned the book from school libraries and classrooms as a result of SF 496, T.S. \ncan no longer check it out from her school library. If Gender Queer: A Memoir were available, \nT.S. would check it out. As a queer person, T.S. feels that SF 496 erases her identity from public \nview.\n  \n174.  Plaintiff  B.F.  long  has  enjoyed  graphic  novels  and  other  fiction  containing \nLGBTQ+ representation that were available in their school library, such as Heartstopper by Alice \nOseman; Lumberjanes by Shannon Watters, Grace Ellis, Gus Allen, and ND Stevenson; Drama \nby Raina Telgemeier; and Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Me by Mariko Tamaki. B.F. was \ninsulted by the list of books that Defendant URBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT \n \n43  Tim Webber, These 5 graphics show the significant impact of 3,400 books banned from Iowa \nschools, Des Moines Register (June 10, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/h5pns6ac.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 54 of 177\n \nbanned. Several of the titles on the original list were books that were important to B.F. growing \nup because they included LGBTQ+ themes or characters. B.F. felt degraded at having their identity \nlabeled too inappropriate to even be in the school. The law and Defendant URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICTโs implementation of it caused B.F. to feel as though they \nshould be ashamed of who they are. B.F. would like to read books on the list for removal, such as \nCall Me By Your Name by Andre Aciman, and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. If they were \nnot banned, B.F. would check out the books  from the school library. Some of the books on the list \nare  even  recommended  reading  before  college.  Defendant  URBANDALE  COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICTโs implementation of SF 496 has deprived B.F. of the opportunity to obtain \nthese books in school and to work through them with other students.  \n175.  Plaintiff  B.F.S.  reviewed  the  long  list  of  books  that  Defendant  WEST  DES \nMOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS created in implementing SF 496.  B.F.S. recognized that \nmany of the books on the list include LGBTQ+ characters and authors, which bothered B.F.S. \nbecause they wish to read books at school that reflect their identity and experience.  \n176.   A.C. previously had access to books that helped answer questions relating to her \ngender identity. Prior to the preliminary injunction, A.C.โs school had started removing books that \nacknowledge the existence of LGBTQ+ people as well as books that educate preteens and young \nteenagers about topics related to sexuality. With the law back in effect, this has continued and been \nseriously harmful to A.C. and students in her age group, who can longer access books that represent \nthem. \n177.  District teachers have reported that K-6 schools were instructed to remove all books \ncontaining what is deemed sexual content or LGBTQ+ content. This lack of clarity leads to over-\n54 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 55 of 177\n \ncensorship. Recently, a series of planned readings by an Iowan author of a novel addressing \nLGBTQ+ themes written for preteens and young teens (Erin Beckerโs Crushing It) was canceled. \n178.  Queer literature is an important part of Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs life. He ceased feeling out \nof place in his own skin after reading Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky, a story about a \ntransgender young person. Orlando by Virginia Woolf helped him realize that queer people existed \nin past generations and that being queer does not need to be labeled the way it is today. \nHeartstopper by Alice Oseman; Good Omens (no. 68 on BBCโs top 200 best-loved novels)44 by \nTerry Pratchet and Neil Gaiman; and Red, White, and Royal Blue (winner of the ALA Alex \nAward)45 by Casey McQuiston gave him hope that one day his life could be filled with as much \nlaughter and queer joy as those characters had. The librarians have told him that that they were \ndirected by the district attorney to remove several books, including All Boys Arenโt Blue by George \nM. Johnson, Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, Letโs Talk About It by Erika Moen and Matthew \nNolan, Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison, and Lucky by Alice Sebold. He was able to check Lawn Boy \nbefore librarians were told to remove the book from the shelves, but he is worried if he doesnโt \nfinish it in time to return it by the due date, he wonโt be able to finish it all. These books made \nP.B.-P. feel safe and welcomed, and he fears that Defendant WATERLOO COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICTโs implementation of SF 496 will deny him access to these books he adores, \nin addition to queer literature he has yet to read. \nSF 496 Has Been Impossible for Educators to Understand and Has Been Implemented \nInconsistently Throughout the State \n179.  The lack of guidance and clarity around the implementation of SF 496 has caused \n \n44 The Big Read, BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml (last visited Oct. 17, \n2024). \n45 2020 Alex Award Winners, supra note 37. \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 56 of 177\n \nserious confusion and concern among educators. The vagueness of these provisions means many \neducators donโt know what is forbidden and what is allowed.  \n180.  The potential for arbitrary enforcement of the GISO Prohibition means teachers are \nnot sure what conduct could lead to discipline, and administrators have felt compelled to adopt \nbroad interpretationsโand impose broad restrictionsโin an effort to steer clear of a sudden \nenforcement action.   \n181.  Plaintiff Aly Telford, a middle school English teacher, has found that the lack of \nclarity in the GISO Prohibition has made it more difficult for her to advocate for the safety and \nacceptance of her LGBTQ+ students. While she teaches primarily seventh graders, she also \ninteracts with the sixth graders in her school regularly. \n182.  For example, Telford was a co-sponsor for the GSA prior to SF 496.  After SF 496 \nshe inquired about restarting the group, but administration advised her that doing so may violate \nthe GISO Prohibition as a โprogramโ or โpromotionโ relating to gender identity.  She was also told \nthat putting posters to advertise the club in the hallโwhere they would be visible to sixth gradersโ\nmay also constitute promotion in violation of the GISO Prohibition.  \n183.  Neither the text of the GISO Prohibition nor State Defendantsโ rulemaking efforts \nhave provided any clarity on whether Plaintiff Telford would be putting her license at risk should \nshe choose to sponsor a student-led GSA, allow sixth graders to join, or allow that GSA to advertise \non school grounds.  \n184.  This  uncertainty  is  particularly  tragic,  as  Plaintiff  Telford  knows  from  past \nexperience that she would be able to use her position as GSA co-sponsor to advocate for LGBTQ+ \nstudents  and act as a safe adult for them to approach  when they  needed  help. The GISO \nProhibitionโs potential to be used as a tool of discrimination against LGBTQ+ students and clubs \n56 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 57 of 177\n \nhas thus both discouraged teachers from supporting their students, and shut those same students \noff from a resource proven to have positive effects.  \n185.  Teacher sponsors of GSAs, including GSAs in school environments with sixth \ngraders present, are able to develop trusting relationships with the student-club members. These \nteachers can leverage that relationship to encourage students to report being teased for having two \ndads, to refrain from unsafe behavior, and to communicate openly with their parents about their \ngender identityโall real examples of interactions Plaintiff Telford had while she co-sponsored the \nschool GSA.  \n186.  However now, the lack of clarity in the GISO Prohibition means that even if Telford \nis able to form a trusting relationship with a student in need, if that student is a sixth grader coming \nto Plaintiff Telford to disclose anti-LGBTQ+ harassment or to seek advice on speaking with their \nparents about their gender identity, she would have to make the untenable choice between risking \nher license and supporting her student.  \n187.  Worse, because the Gender Identity Notification Provision is not clear on whether \na studentโs mere disclosure that they are questioning their gender identity, or a studentโs mere \nrequest the teacher provide them with guidance in coming out to their parents, is a reportable event, \nPlaintiff Telford would have to choose between her license and both (a) whether to help the \nstudent, and (b) whether to report them for seeking that help. Prior to SF 496, Plaintiff Telford \nwould be able to, and indeed had been able to, guide the student and provide them with the \ninformation and the confidence they need to approach their parents on the topic of gender identity \nin a prepared way. Now, Plaintiff Telford must question whether such an interaction is the end of \nher career.   \n57 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 58 of 177\n \n188.  Plaintiff Daniel Gutmann, an educator with DMPS, has similarly expressed how SF \n496 has substantially disrupted his advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the school.  \n189.  As a gay educator, Plaintiff Gutmann was told by his administration that he could \nnot mention his husband in the presence of his students, and if he did, he would face disciplinary \naction. Thankfully the school later reversed course, but this only highlights the vagueness in \npossible interpretations of the provision. His school district simply could notโand still cannotโ\nknow whether allowing LGBTQ+ educators to exist and work as out LGBTQ+ educators is a \nviolation of the GISO Prohibition. He still remains unclear on how to respond if students ask him \nwhy he is married to man or other such questions. The issue is not what policy his school district \nhas adopted on this issue, but what interpretation State Defendantsโ enforcement personnel may \nchoose to apply on that day.   \n190.  The potential application of the GISO Prohibition to books is similarly confusing \nfor educators who maintain diverse books in their classroom. \n191.  Over the course of this litigation, State Defendants have sometimes taken the \nposition that the GISO Prohibition does not require schools to remove books solely because they \nfeature  an  LGBTQ+  character  or  characters.  Other  times,  State  Defendants  have  taken  an \ninconsistent position.46 This shifting litigation position, leading to the conclusion that a book with \nLGBTQ+ characters may be in class, but not read in class, is uncoupled from any text in the GISO \nProhibition or the Proposed Rules implementing it, and does not guarantee State Defendants will \nnot enforce the GISO Prohibition in this way in the future.  \n192.  Regardless, this interpretation does not resolve the lack of clarity in what is \npermitted to be done with those books; in other words, whether Plaintiffs Telford and Gutmann \n \n46 See paragraph 64, supra. \n58 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 59 of 177\n \ncan recommend, read and discuss these books with their students without risk of disciplinary \naction. \n193.  Plaintiff Telford maintains a diverse library in her classroom, which is open to all \nstudents.  She has had students come to her classroom specifically because she had books with \nLGBTQ+ characters. Because of the inconsistency in implementation of SF 496 she is now unsure \nwhat she can continue doing without receiving discipline. Books she had previously used in an \nextracurricular book club featuring LGBTQ+ characters were originally designated for removal. \nEven if not removed, Plaintiff Telford has no certainty on whether resuming such a book club, or \nmerely continuing to recommend certain books with LGBTQ+ characters or addressing issues of \ninterest to LGBTQ+ readers, would constitute a program or promotion relating to gender identity \nin violation of the GISO Prohibition.  \n194.  Plaintiff Gutmann also has a diverse library, including books that discuss LGBTQ+ \nthemes. While he has not been told to remove these books from his classroom, the lack of clarity \nin the GISO Prohibition means he is similarly not sure if can read these books to students in class, \nor even recommend them, without being disciplined for engaging in prohibited curriculum, \ninstruction, or promotion.  \n195.  The GISO Prohibitionโs and Gender Identity Notification Provisionโs confusing \nand vague language is demonstrated by their varying application across school districts.  \n196.  Cindy Harper is an educator at Waverly-Shell Rock Middle School, and has been \nsince 2014.  During this time, she has been an advocate for LGBTQ+ students, including her role \nas a faculty supervisor for the GSA.  The GSA rebranded during the 2022-2023 school year to \nโEquality for Allโ in order to better reflect to the community that it is a group seeking to end \noppression and bias against people not just on the basis of their LGBTQ+ identities, but also \n59 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 60 of 177\n \nbecause of their race, disability, economic status, or religion. The group is still a GSA member of \nthe Iowa Safe Schools GSA Network. \n197.  After her principal told her that SF 496 would apply not only to class but also the \nGSA, Harper has been forced to rethink how she acts as the GSA faculty supervisor, so she does \nnot risk triggering the law. She has students only use their last name and only names that would \nappear in their Infinite Campus portal, to avoid triggering a report home. She also asks students if \ntheir parents support using โthey/themโ pronouns, and if they do not, she tells students not to let \nher know that they use these pronouns.  \n198.  The lack of knowing what the rules are has caused her a lot of frustration and \nresulted in situations where teachers have to decide between advocating for the safety of their \nstudentsโor even just answering their questions in classโand potentially jeopardizing their \nlicensure. The lack of clarity has also led to inaction. With school districts fearful of crossing a \nline they cannot see, past efforts to support LGBTQ+ students have often been put on hold.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nI.  VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT FOR OVERBREADTH \n199.  The Library Restriction and Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition, on \ntheir face, violate the First Amendment as overbroad.   \n200.  The First Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment \nand enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides in part that the government โshall make \nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . of the right of the people peaceably to assemble.โ  \n201.  Under the First Amendment, a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial \nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statuteโs plainly legitimate \n60 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 61 of 177\n \nsweep. This less demanding standard for facial challenges in First Amendment cases exists to \nprovide breathing room for free expression.  \n202.  The first step in a facial analysis is to assess the scope of the challenged laws; \nexpressed differently, to ask: what activities, by what actors, do the laws prohibit or otherwise \nregulate?  As described in greater detail in the counts below, these challenged provisions of SF \n496 are of a staggering, unprecedentedly broad scope.   \n203.  The second step in a facial analysis is to determine which of the lawsโ applications \nviolate the First Amendment.  As described in greater detail in the counts below, and as further \narticulated in other claims asserted on First Amendment grounds in this Complaint, a substantial \nnumber of the provisionsโ applications violate the First Amendment.   \n204.  The third step in a facial analysis is to measure the unconstitutional applications \nagainst  the  remaining  provisions.  As  described  in  greater  detail  in  the  counts  below,  the \napplications of the provisions that remain are insignificant when compared to the unconstitutional \napplications.     \nCount 1  \nThe Library Restriction is Facially Unconstitutional for Overbreadth \n205.  The  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 62 of 177\n \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants.   \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n206.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 199 through 204 as if fully set forth herein.  \n207.  The Library Restriction includes within its scope the operation of all kindergarten \nthrough grade twelve library programs in the State of Iowaโs public school system.  \n208.  The term โlibrary programโ is undefined but generally understood to mean the \nspace each Iowa elementary school, middle school, junior high, or high school sets aside in the \nbuilding or by arrangement with a local public library for the collection of books and other \nmaterials and resources made available to the students attending such schools. \n209.  The term โlibrary programโ may also include within its scope the collections of \nbooks commonly maintained in individual teachersโ classrooms. \n210.  The Library Restriction imposes a new restriction on the โmaterial,โ principally \nbooks, though often including other media such as audiobooks, movies, music, or games, which \nmay be made available to the students who access such library spaces. \n211.  Thus,  the  Library  Restriction  regulates  actors  including  the  schools,  school \nemployees, and, in the case of local libraries made available to the school by agreement, third \nparties maintaining these libraries, as well as the students who are accessing them.   \n62 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 63 of 177\n \n212.  The activities from which these actors are restricted is the inclusion of or, in the \ncase of students, access to, any material that includes a โdescription[] or visual depiction[] of a sex \nact.โ The term โsex actโ is separately defined in Iowa Code to mean sexual contact, in its various \nforms, between two or more persons.  \n213.  This definitional term does not include any qualification or adjustment for the \nfrequency, type, or character of the descriptions or depictions contained within the material, the \nmaterialโs target audience or its restricted availability within the school system to students of \ncertain grades, the materialโs intention as to the inclusion of such a description or depiction, the \nmaterialโs merit or value in other respects when taken as a whole, or any other characteristic of the \nmaterial or its audience, with the exception of โthe Bible, the Torah, . . . the Koran,โ and undefined \nother โreligious books,โ which are excluded from the Library Restriction notwithstanding any \ndescriptions or depictions of a sex act contained therein.  \n214.  Accordingly, the Library Restriction includes within its scope a massive amount of \nbooks and materials that had previously been made available in Iowa school libraries by and, in \nthe case of students, accessed by, these actors because of the booksโ and materialsโ quality and \nidentified support for the schoolsโ and studentsโ educational goals.  \n215.  An application of the Library Restriction violates the First Amendment if it results \nin a removal of books or materials that unjustifiably infringes upon a studentโs right to receive \ninformation.  \n216.  Studentsโ First Amendment right to receive information includes the right to access \nbooks and materials otherwise made available in school libraries. This right is infringed upon when \nsuch a book or material is removed from the studentโs access without adequate justification.   \n63 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 64 of 177\n \n217.  When  an  infringement  upon  the  right  to  receive  information  occurs,  it  is \nunconstitutional unless justified by a substantial and reasonable governmental interest or, at a \nminimum, a legitimate pedagogical concern.  \n218.  State Defendants have conceded that every book removed thus far has included a \ndescription or depiction of a sex act which would qualify it for exclusion under the Library \nRestriction. This number is in the thousands of books.  \n219.  This statewide culling of library books does not serve either a substantial and \nreasonable governmental interest or a legitimate pedagogical purpose.  \n220.  The books that have been or will be removed had already been assessed to support \nand comport with the schoolsโ central mission of educating Iowaโs children. Local school districts, \nand particularly their professional teacher-librarians, are well-qualified and dedicated to ensuring \nthe materials selected for inclusion in the school library are suitable for the developmental and \nsocial maturity of the grade or grades for which the materials are made available; in other words, \nthey are age appropriate. Such inclusion decisions have additionally been subject to the oversight \nof the local school boards authorized to hear and resolve any objections made by the parents or \nguardians of the students within the district. The State cannot justify the Library Restrictionโs \nhardline overriding of this traditionally local discretion.  \n221.  These unconstitutional applications of the Library Restriction are substantial when \ncompared to any applications that remain.  \n222.  The Library Restriction is not readily susceptible to a limiting construction that \nwould render it constitutional. State Defendantsโ attempts at rulemaking have failed, and will fail \nagain should they be allowed to continue, at limiting the Library Restrictionโs unconstitutional \noverbreadth.  \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 65 of 177\n \n223.  Plaintiff Students are all students at Iowa public schools subject to the Library \nRestriction. All Plaintiff Studentsโ right to receive information has been infringed upon or is \nimminent danger of being infringed upon by both State Defendants and their respective School \ndistrict Defendants due to the Library Restriction.  \n224.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include individual students in Iowa public schools \nsubject to the Library Restriction. Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the \nright of these members to receive information, infringed upon by both State Defendants and their \nrespective School District Defendants due to the Library Restriction.  \n225.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to have access to books and other materials \nreflecting their identity.  \n226.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.   \n227.  State Defendants and School district Defendants are responsible for enforcement of \nthe Library Restriction. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa \nSafe Schools in its representational capacity would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ \nenforcement of the Library Restriction, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ \nlocal school districts would make the removed books and materials available to them again, given \nall such books and materials previously included in these school libraries had already been deemed \nto be age appropriate and supportive of the schoolsโ and studentsโ educational goals.  \n228.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \n65 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 66 of 177\n \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants (and their \nmembersโ respective School District Defendants) on the other, concerning the constitutionality, \nand specifically the overbreadth, of the Library Restriction. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchools  respectfully  request  a  declaration  from  this  Court  that  the  Library  Restriction  is \nunconstitutionally overbroad.  \n229.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have suffered and \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, \nenforcement, and threat of enforcement of the Library Restriction. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Students \nand Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity respectfully request injunctive relief that \nenjoins State Defendants and their membersโ respective School District Defendants from enforcing \nthe Library Restriction.  \nCount 2 \n The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition is \nFacially Unconstitutional for Overbreadth \n230.  The  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n66 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 67 of 177\n \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants.   \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n231.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 199 through 204 as if fully set forth herein.  \n232.  The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition includes within its scope any \nprogram, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender \nidentity or sexual orientation available to any student in grades kindergarten through sixth in an \nIowa public school.  \n233.  โProgram,โ โtest,โ โsurvey,โ โquestionnaire,โ โpromotionโ and โinstructionโ are \nnot  separately  defined  in  Iowa  statute.  However,  Iowa  Administrative  Regulations  define \nโeducational programโ as โthe entire offering of the school, including out-of-class activities and \nthe sequences of curriculum areas and activities,โ and โcurriculumโ as โall the courses offered.โ  \n234.  These  terms,  together  with  the  ordinary  meaning  of  โtest,โ  โsurvey,โ \nโquestionnaire,โ and, particularly, โpromotionโ and โinstruction,โ encompass the provision of \nessentially all information to students in grades kindergarten through sixth. Consequently, the \nGISO Prohibition regulates the activities of students in grades kindergarten through sixth, who are \nprohibited from receiving such information or engaging with any such โprogram,โ โcurriculum,โ \n67 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 68 of 177\n \nโtest,โ โsurvey,โ โquestionnaire,โ โpromotion,โ or โinstruction,โ to the extent such activities are \nโrelated to gender identity or sexual orientation.โ  \n235.  The activities from which these actors are restricted depends upon the meaning of \nthe statutory language, โrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation.โ  \n236.  The phrase โrelated toโ is an expansive phrase that is ordinarily understood to mean \nto stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; or to bring into association \nwith or connection with.  \n237.  The terms โgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ are separately defined in Iowa \nCode as โa gender-related identity of a person, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at birth,โ \nand โactual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality,โ respectively. \n238.  State Defendants have asserted that, notwithstanding these neutral definitions, the \nGISO Prohibition is intended to apply only to non-cisgender identities and non-heterosexual \norientations; in other words, those identities and orientations captured by the acronym โLGBTQ+โ.  \n239.  In summary, the GISO Prohibition prohibits the availability of and engagement in \nany activity within the school that bears upon or concerns LGBTQ+ identities and orientations.  \n240.  Studentsโ First Amendment rights in school-connected settings include the right to \nreceive information, the right to engage in speech and expressive conduct, and the right to \nexpressive association.  \n241.  Studentsโ  First  Amendment  right  to  receive  information  is  unconstitutionally \ninfringed upon when information otherwise made available in the school is removed from studentsโ \naccess without adequate governmental justification.  \n242.  Applications of the GISO Prohibition that have infringed upon studentsโ First \nAmendment right to receive information include the prohibition on classroom activities that bear \n68 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 69 of 177\n \nupon LGBTQ+ identities and orientations, such as an in-class reading of a book featuring an \nLGBTQ+ character; the prohibition of instruction on LGBTQ+ identities and orientations, such as \nexplanation or guidance on gender identity in response to an incident of harassment or bullying; \nthe prohibition on promotion of books and materials with LGBTQ+ characters and themes, such \nas by recommendation or display; and, to the extent such has occurred and continues to occur \nnotwithstanding State Defendantsโ assertion that the GISO Prohibition does not apply to the \navailability of books in school libraries, the removal of books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes.  \n243.  This restriction on information does not serve either a substantial and reasonable \ngovernmental interest or a legitimate pedagogical concern.  \n244.  Studentsโ First Amendment right to engage in speech and expressive conduct is \nunconstitutionally infringed upon if the speech or expressive conduct is, in the case of school-\nsponsored speech, restricted without reasonable relation to a legitimate pedagogical concern, or, \nin the case of private, noncurricular speech, restricted despite not presenting a material and \nsubstantial interference with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of school \nor impinging upon the rights of other students.  \n245.  Applications of the GISO Prohibition that have infringed upon studentsโ First \nAmendment right to engage in speech and expressive conduct include the prohibition of classroom \ndiscussion of LGBTQ+ issues, such as a student project on the history of LGBTQ+ rights or an \nLGBTQ+ figure; the prohibition of the display of LGBTQ+ symbols, such as student placement \nof a flyer for an LGBTQ+ pride group; and other chilling or forced self-censorship caused by the \nGISO Prohibition, such as students refraining from engaging in speech or expressive conduct that \nwould identify them as LGBTQ+, during and outside of classroom instructional time.  \n69 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 70 of 177\n \n246.  These restrictions on student speech and expressive conduct are, in the case of \nspeech deemed school-sponsored, not justified by a reasonable relation to a legitimate pedagogical \nconcern, or, in the case of private, noncurricular speech, not justified by the presentation of a \nmaterial  and  substantial  interference  with  the  requirements  of  appropriate  discipline  in  the \noperation of school or impingement upon the rights of other students.  \n247.  Studentsโ First Amendment right to expressive association is unconstitutionally \ninfringed upon if it is restricted based upon the viewpoint expressed.  \n248.   Applications of the GISO Prohibition that have infringed upon studentsโ First \nAmendment right to expressive association include the prohibition on student-led, extracurricular \nGSAs.  \n249.  The prohibition on GSAs is based upon the views expressed by such groups; \nnamely, the promotion of LGBTQ+ studentsโ rights.  \n250.  The above-described unconstitutional applications of the GISO Prohibition are \nsubstantial when compared to any applications that remain.  \n251.  The GISO Prohibition is not readily susceptible to a limiting construction that \nwould render it constitutional. State Defendantsโ attempts at rulemaking have failed, and will fail \nagain should they  be allowed to  continue, to limit the  GISO Prohibitionโs unconstitutional \noverbreadth.  \n252.  Student Plaintiff A.C. is a fifth-grade student in an Iowa public school subject to \nthe Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Prohibition. Student Plaintiff A.C.โs First Amendment \nright to receive information has been infringed upon by the prohibition of instruction on LGBTQ+ \nissues in response to an incident of harassment or bullying; and the removal or prohibition on the \npromotion of books describing and explaining LGBTQ+ identities and orientation or otherwise \n70 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 71 of 177\n \nfeaturing LGBTQ+ themes or characters, as well as the removal and prohibition on the promotion \nof symbols of LGBTQ+ inclusion. Student Plaintiff A.C.โs First Amendment right to engage in \nspeech and expressive conduct has been infringed upon in that she has been chilled or forced to \nengage in self-censorship including refraining from classroom discussion of LGBTQ+ issues, and \nrefrained from speech or expressive conduct that would identify her as transgender. Student \nPlaintiff A.C.โs First Amendment right to engage in expressive association has been infringed upon \nby the prohibition on the maintenance of a student-led, extracurricular GSA. \n253.  Plaintiff Students are all students in Iowa public school districts subject to the GISO \nProhibition. All Plaintiff Studentsโ First Amendment right to speech and expressive conduct has \nbeen infringed upon as they have engaged in or assert the rights of students who have been chilled \nor forced to engage in self-censorship due to the GISO Prohibition.  \n254.  Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational capacity has been injured by the loss of \nrevenue associated with educator participation in online and in-person programming on LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity in the school setting made impermissible by the GISO Prohibition and the consequent \nharm to its mission-critical outreach and impact programs; the additional costs incurred to answer \neducatorsโ questions relating to the scope and effect of the GISO Prohibition on preexisting \nLGBTQ+ inclusivity training and policies; the further costs incurred to prepare, modify, offer, and \nimplement LGBTQ+ inclusivity programming in-school and out-of-school that addresses the \nlimitations on educatorsโ, studentsโ, and GSAsโ activities created by the GISO Prohibition; the \nforced redirection of professional development resources outside of the traditional K-12 focus due \nto the inability to implement its resources and guidance in the K-12 setting under the GISO \nProhibition; and the frustration of its organizational purpose of maintaining a GSA network by the \nrestrictions and prohibitions imposed upon its member GSAs.  \n71 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 72 of 177\n \n255.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nmembers also include GSAs, including GSAs in kindergarten through sixth-grade schools. Iowa \nSafe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of those student members whose \nrights to receive information, engage in speech and expressive conduct, and engage in expressive \nassociation have been infringed upon by the GISO Prohibition. Iowa Safe Schools further asserts \nin its representational capacity the rights of GSAs in its membership that have had their right to \nengage in expressive association infringed upon by the GISO Prohibition. The interests at stake \nare germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in that Iowa Safe Schools is an \norganization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ students, including the right of \nLGBTQ+ students to have access to information about their identity, engage in speech and \nexpressive conduct that expresses their identity, and engage in expressive association by forming \nand participating in GSAs to promote and preserve their rights as LGBTQ+ students. Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation of its individual members.   \n256.  State Defendants are responsible for enforcement of the GISO Prohibition. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought by  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its \norganizational and associational capacities would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ \nenforcement of the GISO Prohibition, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ \nlocal school districts would revert to practices and policies in place prior to enforcement of the \nGISO Prohibition.  \n257.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and associational capacities on the \n72 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 73 of 177\n \none hand, and State Defendants on the other, concerning the constitutionality, and specifically the \noverbreadth, of the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully \nrequest a declaration from this Court that the GISO Prohibition is unconstitutionally overbroad.  \n258.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and \ngender sexuality alliance members have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as \na direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement \nof the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and gender sexuality \nalliance members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Students and Iowa \nSafe Schools in its organizational and representational capacity respectfully request injunctive \nrelief that enjoins State Defendants from enforcing the GISO Prohibition.  \nII. VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS FOR \nVAGUENESS  \n259.  The  Library  Restriction,  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Prohibition,  and \nGender Identity Notification Provision are, on their face, unconstitutionally vague in violation the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n260.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, provides that โ[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law.โ  \n261.  A law is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment if it \nfails to provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct and authorizes or encourages arbitrary \nenforcement.  \n262.  A severe enforcement mechanism lessens the degree of tolerable vagueness.  \n73 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 74 of 177\n \n263.  To the extent a law intrudes upon an area protected by the First Amendment, \nstandards of permissible vagueness are strict, and the government may regulate only the matter \nonly with narrow specificity.  \nCount 1  \nThe Library Restriction is Facially Unconstitutional for Vagueness \n  \n264.  The  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants. \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n265.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 259 through 263 as if fully set forth in this Count.  \n266.  The Library Restriction fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable \nopportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits and authorizes or encourages arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement.  \n74 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 75 of 177\n \n267.  The Library Restriction is vague in its use of the phrase โdescription or visual \ndepiction.โ  \n268.  The ordinary understanding of a description is โan act of describing,โ โdiscourse \nintended to give a mental image of something experienced,โ or โa statement or account giving the \ncharacteristics of someone or something: a descriptive statement or account.โ  \n269.  The ordinary understanding of a depiction is โa representation in words or images \nof someone or something.โ  \n270.  The Library Restriction contains no qualifying or quantifying language that would \naddress the level of specificity, frequency, or explicitness that would rise to the level of a prohibited \ndescription or visual depiction.  \n271.  The Library Restriction is additionally vague in that it regulates a medium of \ncreative  expressionโbooks  and  other  materialsโwithout  accounting  for  their  unique \ncharacteristics, such as a materialโs intended effect, its merit as a whole, or its target audience.  \n272.  By failing to provide clear boundaries on the books and materials prohibited by its \nterms, the Library Restriction has invited and resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \nMost notably, the creation and implementation of conflicting lists of books and materials subject \nto removal.  \n273.  Studentsโ First Amendment right to receive information includes the right to access \nbooks and materials otherwise made available in school libraries. This right is infringed upon when \nsuch a book or material is removed from the studentโs access without adequate justification.  \n274.  Plaintiff Students are all students at Iowa public schools subject to the Library \nRestriction. All Plaintiff Studentsโ right to receive information, and, consequently, their Fourteenth \nAmendment right to due process, has been infringed upon or is imminent danger of being infringed \n75 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 76 of 177\n \nupon due to the vagueness of the Library Restriction, in that they have lost or are imminent danger \nof arbitrarily or discriminatorily losing access to books or materials otherwise made available in \ntheir school libraries, have experienced stigmatization or wish to access, read, and discuss such \nbooks or materials without experiencing stigmatization due to the arbitrary and discriminatory \nlabeling of such removed books, in particular books by LGBTQ+ authors, featuring LGBTQ+ \ncharacters, or addressing LGBTQ+ issues, as inappropriate, โpornography,\" โsexually explicit,โ or \notherwise  unacceptable  in  the  school  environment;  and  have  otherwise  experienced  or  are \nimminent danger of experiencing an infringement upon their First Amendment right.  \n275.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include individual students in Iowa public schools \nsubject to the Library Restriction. Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the \nright of these members to receive information and not be subject to vague laws, infringed upon by \nthe Library Restriction. The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs \npurpose, in that Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of \nLGBTQ+ students, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to have access to books and other \nmaterials reflecting their identity. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require \nthe participation of its individual members.  \n276.  State Defendants are responsible for enforcement of the Library Restriction. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought by  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its \nrepresentational capacity would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ enforcement of the \nLibrary Restriction, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ local school districts \nwould make the removed books and materials available to them again, given all such books and \nmaterials previously included in these school libraries had already been deemed to be age \nappropriate and supportive of the schoolsโ and studentsโ educational goals.  \n76 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 77 of 177\n \n277.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother, concerning the constitutionality, and specifically the vagueness, of the Library Restriction. \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request a declaration from this Court that the \nLibrary Restriction is unconstitutionally vague. \nCount 2  \nThe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition is Facially Unconstitutional for \nVagueness \n  \n278.  This count is brought by Plaintiff Educators against State Defendants. \n279.  This count is also brought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools, in its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants.   \n77 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 78 of 177\n \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants. \n280.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 259 through 263 as if fully set forth in this Count.  \n281.  The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition fails to provide people of \nordinary  intelligence  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  understand  what  conduct  it  prohibits  and \nauthorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  \n282.  The GISO Prohibition is vague as to the activities to which it applies: โany program, \ncurriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction.โ By use of the term โany,โ the \nGISO Prohibition indicates that the listed terms are intended to be interpreted as broadly as \npossible.  \n283.  The ordinary understanding of a program is โa public notice,โ a โperformanceโ or \nโoutline of the order to be followed, of the features to be presented, and the persons participatingโ \nin a performance; โa plan or system under which action may be taken toward a goal,โ โcurriculum,โ \nor โprospectus, syllabus.โ Separately, an โEducational Programโ is defined under Iowa law as โthe \nentire offering of the school, including out-of-class activities and the sequences of curriculum areas \nand activities,โ and the phrase โlibrary programโ is used elsewhere in SF 496, namely, in the \nLibrary Restriction.  \n284.  The GISO Prohibition fails to identify to which of these uses of the term program, \nas ordinarily understood or separately defined in Iowa law, it refers, such that a person of ordinary \nintelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand if its regulations apply to the \nentirety of in-class and out-of-class activities, coursework, school libraries, extracurricular groups, \nschool performances, sport teams, bathrooms, after-school events, field trips, or any other offering \nor activity that may conceivably occur on or off school grounds if associated with the school. \n78 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 79 of 177\n \n285.  The term curriculum is defined in Iowa regulations as โall the courses offeredโ and \nhas an ordinary understanding of โthe courses offered by an educational institution.โ The GISO \nProhibition fails to identify whether the use of this term refers to which courses may be offered, \nthe assignments or projects given in a course, studentsโ self-directed work or the presentation of \ntheir work in class, an educatorโs statements or guidance in class, or how the prohibition on \ncurriculum interacts with the school districtsโ obligation to use a nondiscriminatory, multicultural, \nand gender-fair approach to education, such that a person of ordinary intelligence is not given a \nreasonable opportunity to understand to which, or all, of these activities the rule applies.  \n286.  The ordinary understanding of survey is, as to appraisals, โto examine as to \ncondition, situation, or value,โ โto query (someone) in order to collect data for the analysis of some \naspect of a group or areaโ; as to land, to take measurements; and otherwise, โto view or consider \ncomprehensively,โ โinspect,โ or โscrutinize.โ The term survey appears elsewhere in SF 496 as \nlisted with โanalysis, activity, or evaluation,โ and elsewhere, a โformal examination[] or survey[].โ \nFurther, the term survey is used by State Defendants to refer to the Iowa Youth Survey, and is also \nused by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey provided by the CDC. The GISO Prohibition fails to \nprovide a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand whether its use \nof this term is intended to refer to such โformalโ surveys, or more generally to any question posed \nto or assessment taken of a student or group of students.  \n287.  The term โquestionnaireโ does not appear elsewhere in SF 496. It is generally \nunderstood to mean โa set of questions for obtaining statistically useful or personal information \nfrom individuals,โ โa written or printed questionnaire often with spaces for answers,โ or โa survey \nmade by the use of a questionnaire.โ The GISO Prohibition does not provide clarification as to \nwhat the term โquestionnaireโ refers to in this context, if given a separate meaning from โsurvey.โ    \n79 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 80 of 177\n \n288.  The term โpromotionโ is ordinarily understood to refer to โthe act of furthering the \ngrowth or development of something.โ The GISO Prohibitionโs failure to define or limit the \nunderstanding  of  the  term  means  there  is  no  clarification  on  what  acts  or  activities  might \nreasonably be construed to be in furtherance of the prohibited topics. A person of ordinary \nintelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand whether the GISO Prohibitionโs \nuse of the term โpromotionโ may include displays in school hallways or classrooms, a display of \nbooks  or  other  materials,  in-class  reading  or  discussion,  educatorsโ  self-identification, \nacknowledgement or affirmance or students, extracurricular groups or events, or any other act or \nsymbol that may be construed as promoting a prohibited concept.  \n289.  The term โinstructionโ is used in SF 496 to refer to an โinstructional programโ and \nโinstructional materials.โ The term is ordinarily understood to refer broadly to โthe action, practice, \nor  profession  of  teaching.โ  The  GISO  Prohibition  does  not  provide  a  person  of  ordinary \nintelligence  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  understand  whether  it  includes  on  mandatory  or \ncompulsory instruction, such as giving a lecture to a seated class, or if it refers to every aspect of \nthe practice of teaching, such as discussions with students, whether those are part of an identified \nlesson plan, on a  studentโs  ideas or  wellbeing,  or  casually in  an effort to  form a positive \nrelationship, or if it includes facilitating studentsโ own preparation and presentation of coursework \nor allowing studentsโ own speech or expressive conduct in or out of class.  \n290.  The vagueness of these terms is not cured by giving them their ordinary meaning, \nreferencing their use in other parts of the statute or Iowa law, noting their common features, \nidentifying what words may have been used or excluded, considering the consequences of a \nparticular meaning, or engaging in any other inquiry of statutory construction or interpretation.  \n291.  The GISO Prohibition is further vague in its use of the phrase โrelating to.โ  \n80 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 81 of 177\n \n292.  Under Iowa rules of statutory interpretation, relating to, as with phrases such as \nlinked to, in connection with, or associated with, are construed to require only a relation or nexus \nto the identified subject.  \n293.  The GISO Prohibition fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable \nopportunity to understand when or if an activity relates to the prohibited topics.  \n294.  The GISO Prohibition is further vague in its use of the terms โgender identityโ and \nโsexual orientation.โ  \n295.  SF 496 defines these terms using the definition given them elsewhere in Iowa law; \nspecifically, as โa gender-related identity of a person, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at \nbirth,โ and โactual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality,โ respectively. \n296.  Under Iowa rules of statutory interpretation, when the legislature has specifically \ndefined a term, the definition given must normally be used, even if the term as defined by the \nlegislature  does  not  coincide  with  dictionary  or  common  law  definitions.  In  this  case,  the \nencompassing use of the terms gender identity and sexual orientation that refers to all gender \nidentities and sexual orientations. Following this obligation, the GISO Prohibition would mean \nthat any acknowledgment or reference of any kind that identifies a real or fictional personโs gender \nidentity or sexual orientation would be prohibited.  \n297.  Notwithstanding,  State  Defendants  have  asserted  the  legislatively  prescribed \nmeanings of gender identity and sexual orientation should not be used, as State Defendants assert \nthis would lead to an โabsurdโ result inconsistent with other provisions of Iowa law governing, for \nexample, school sports teams and bathrooms. State Defendants have instead asserted the terms \nmust be understood to mean only non-cisgender identities and non-heterosexual orientations.  \n81 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 82 of 177\n \n298.  The GISO Prohibitionโs failure to define its terms in a way State Defendants find \nfeasible of implementation, as well as State Defendantsโ own rewriting of the GISO Prohibition, \ninjects substantial uncertainty into the meaning of the terms, such that a person of ordinary \nintelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand what topics or concepts are \nprohibited from the regulated activities.  \n299.  By failing to provide clear boundaries on the activities regulated, the concepts \nprohibited, and the requisite nexus between the two that would give rise to a violation, the GISO \nProhibition has invited and resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Most notably, \nvastly different policies governing the conduct of educators and the expression of students and \nstudent groups.  \n300.  Plaintiff Educators have a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from \nlaws that are so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence does not have fair notice of what is \nprohibited.  \n301.  Plaintiff  Educators  are  teachers  at  Iowa  public  schools  subject  to  the  GISO \nProhibition. Plaintiff Educators are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including a loss of \nteaching licensure, for any violation of the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff Educatorsโ Fourteenth \nAmendment right to be free from vague laws has been infringed upon due to the GISO Prohibition, \nin that they do not have fair notice of what is proscribed behavior such that they may govern their \nconduct accordingly.   \n302.  Plaintiff Students have First Amendment rights to receive information, engage in \nspeech and expressive conduct, and the right to expressive association.  \n303.  Plaintiff Studentsโ First Amendment rights, and, consequently, their Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, have been infringed upon due to the vagueness of the Gender Identity/Sexual \n82 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 83 of 177\n \nOrientation Prohibition, in that the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the \nGISO Prohibition has chilled them or forced them to engage in self-censorship, deprived them of \naccess to information, interfered with their ability to engage in expressive association, and has \notherwise infringed upon their First Amendment rights.  \n304.  Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational capacity has been injured by the loss of \nrevenue associated with educator participation in online and in-person programming on LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity in the school setting made impermissible by or declined due to fear of arbitrary or \ndiscriminatory enforcement of the vague GISO Prohibition and the consequent harm to its mission-\ncritical outreach and impact programs; the additional costs incurred to answer educatorsโ questions \nrelating to the scope and effect of the vague GISO Prohibition on preexisting LGBTQ+ inclusivity \ntraining and policies; the further costs incurred to prepare, modify, offer, and implement LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity programming in-school and out-of-school that addresses the limitations on educatorsโ, \nstudentsโ, and GSAsโ activities created by the GISO Prohibition and the risks of arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory  enforcement  of  its  vague  prohibitions;  the  forced  redirection  of  professional \ndevelopment resources outside of the traditional K-12 focus due to the fear of implementing its \nresources and guidance in the K-12 setting under the vague and arbitrarily and discriminatorily \nenforced GISO Prohibition; and the frustration of its organizational purpose of maintaining a GSA \nnetwork by the restrictions and prohibitions imposed upon its member GSAs due to the fear of \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the GISO Prohibition.  \n305.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nmembers also include GSAs, including GSAs in kindergarten through sixth-grade schools. Iowa \nSafe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of those student members whose \n83 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 84 of 177\n \nrights to receive information, engage in speech and expressive conduct, and engage in expressive \nassociation have been infringed upon due to the vagueness of the GISO Prohibition. Iowa Safe \nSchools further asserts in its representational capacity the rights of GSAs in its membership that \nhave had their right to engage in expressive association infringed upon by due to the fear of \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the GISO Prohibition.  \n306.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to have access to information about their \nidentity, engage in speech and expressive conduct that expresses their identity, and engage in \nexpressive association by forming and participating in GSAs to promote and preserve their rights \nas LGBTQ+ students.  \n307.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ direct injury claim and the relief it requests do not require the \nparticipation of its individual members.  \n308.  State Defendants are responsible for enforcement of the GISO Prohibition. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff Educators, Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe \nSchools in its organizational and associational capacities would redress the harm caused by State \nDefendantsโ  enforcement  of  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Prohibition,  as  Plaintiff \nStudentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ local school districts would revert to practices and \npolicies  in  place  prior  to  enforcement,  including  the  fear  of  arbitrary  and  discriminatory \nenforcement, of the GISO Prohibition.  \n309.  Plaintiff Educators, Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational \nand  representational  capacity  are  entitled  to  injunctive  relief.  Plaintiff  Educators,  Plaintiff \nStudents, and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and gender sexuality alliance members have suffered \n84 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 85 of 177\n \nand will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, \noperation, enforcement, and threat of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the vague GISO \nProhibition. Plaintiff Educators, Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and gender \nsexuality alliance members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law.  \n310.  Plaintiff  Educators  respectfully  request  injunctive  relief  that  enjoins  State \nDefendants from enforcing the GISO Prohibition.  \n311.  Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe Schools in both its own organizational capacity \nand its representational capacity, respectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins All Defendants \nfrom enforcing the GISO Prohibition. \nCount 3  \nThe Gender Identity Notification Provision is Facially Unconstitutional for Vagueness  \n  \n312.

The Gender Identity Notification Provision fails to provide people of ordinary \nintelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits and authorizes or \nencourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  \n316.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision is vague as to  what constitutes a \nreportable โrequestโ for an โaccommodationโ โintended to affirm the studentโs gender identity.โ  \n317.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision provides a single example of a request \nfor an accommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs gender identity, as โincluding a \nrequest that the licensed practitioner address the student using a name or pronoun assigned to the \nstudent in the school districtโs registration forms or records.โ The use of the term โincludingโ \nindicates a request for a name or pronoun different than that assigned to the student in school \nrecords is only one of multiple reportable requests for accommodation. \n318.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision does not state the level of specificity \nwith which a request must be made before the reporting obligation is triggered, such that a person \nof ordinary intelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand whether a reporting \nobligation is triggered by a request that could be construed as gender-affirming alone, or if the \nobligation is not triggered until the student clearly states the request is intended to affirm a gender \nidentity.  \n86 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 87 of 177\n \n319.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision does not state whether the reporting \nobligation is limited to requests made during school hours or school activities, such that a person \nof ordinary intelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand whether a request made \nor received after school hours or outside of school events would trigger the obligation.  \n320.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision does not separately define the term \nโaccommodation.โ The term โaccommodationโ is not used elsewhere in SF 496. In the school \nsetting, Iowa law elsewhere refers to an โaccommodationโ as a request to school officials for \nalternative  restroom  or  changing  facilities.  State  and  federal  law  also  use  the  term \nโaccommodationโ in the school setting to refer to the provision of aid or the modification of the \neducational program offered a student as may be necessary to ensure the studentโs access to a free \nand appropriate public education. Accommodation is otherwise ordinarily understood as the act of \naccommodating someone, as providing what is needed or desired for convenience. The Gender \nIdentity Notification Provisionโs use of the term accommodation renders it vague, such that a \nperson of ordinary intelligence is not given a reasonable opportunity to understand what activities \nconstitute a reportable accommodation, such as a request to be referred to by a nickname, a request \nfor counseling or therapy services, a request for permission to use the restroom or join a sports \nteam, or a request to join and participate openly in a GSA, or a request for intervention in response \nto an incident of anti-transgender bullying.   \n321.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision is further vague in its incorporation of \nthe definition of โgender identityโ elsewhere used in Iowa law as โa gender-related identity of a \nperson, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at birth.โ As a term defined by the legislature, this \ndefinition, which includes all gender identities, must normally be used. The Gender Identity \nNotification Provision thus fails to limit the scope of reportable requests that may be construed as \n87 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 88 of 177\n \naffirming a gender identity, such that every request for a name or nickname, even if aligning with \nthe studentโs gender assigned at birth, could be deemed to trigger the obligation.   \n322.  Plaintiff Educators have a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from \nlaws that are so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence does not have fair notice of what is \nprohibited.  \n323.  Plaintiff Educators are teachers at Iowa public schools subject to the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Educators are subject to disciplinary action, up to and \nincluding a loss of teaching licensure, for any violation of the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision. Plaintiff Educatorsโ Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from vague laws has been \ninfringed upon due to the Gender Identity Notification Provision, in that they do not have fair \nnotice of what is proscribed behavior such that they may govern their conduct accordingly. \n324.  Plaintiff  Students  have First  Amendment rights  engage  in  speech, expressive \nconduct, and expressive association.  \n325.  Plaintiff Studentsโ First Amendment rights, and, consequently, their Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, have been infringed upon due to the vagueness of the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision, in that the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the \nGender  Identity  Notification  Provision  has  chilled  them  or  forced  them  to  engage  in  self-\ncensorship and has otherwise infringed upon their First Amendment rights.  \n326.  Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational capacity has been injured by the loss of \nrevenue associated with educator participation in online and in-person programming on LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity in the school setting made impermissible by or declined due to fear of arbitrary or \ndiscriminatory  enforcement  of  the  vague  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision  and  the \nconsequent harm to its mission-critical outreach and impact programs; the additional costs incurred \n88 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 89 of 177\n \nto answer educatorsโ questions relating to the scope and effect of the vague Gender Identity \nNotification Provision on preexisting LGBTQ+ inclusivity training and policies; the further costs \nincurred to prepare, offer, and implement LGBTQ+ inclusivity programming that addresses the \nlimitations  on  educatorsโ,  studentsโ,  and  GSAsโ  activities  created  by  the  Gender  Identity \nNotification Provision and the risks of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of its vague \nprohibitions; and the frustration of its organizational purpose of maintaining a GSA network by \nthe restrictions and prohibitions imposed upon its member GSAs due to the fear of arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n327.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members also include GSAs. Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its \nrepresentational capacity the rights of those student members whose rights to engage in speech, \nexpressive conduct, and in expressive association have been infringed upon due to the vagueness \nof the Gender Identity Notification Provision, in that they have refrained from speech that would \npotentially  trigger  a  report,  including  identifying  themselves  as  transgender  or  gender \nnonconforming, seeking relief from anti-transgender bullying, and utilizing school counseling or \nsupport services, and have further refrained from open participation in GSAs due to the risk of \nbeing reported.  \n328.  Iowa Safe Schools further asserts in its representational capacity the rights of GSAs \nin its membership that have had their right to engage in expressive association infringed upon by \ndue to the fear of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision, in that membership and open participation in GSAs has declined due to studentsโ fear \nof a report, and in that GSAs have been denied support provided other student groups for \neducatorsโ fear of having to make a report.  \n89 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 90 of 177\n \n329.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to engage in speech and expressive conduct that \nexpresses their identity, and engage in expressive association by forming and participating in \nGSAs to promote and preserve their rights as LGBTQ+ students.  \n330.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.   \n331.  State  Defendants  are  responsible  for  enforcement  of  the  Gender  Identity \nNotification  Provision.  The  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  sought  by  Plaintiff  Educators, \nPlaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and associational capacities would \nredress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ local school districts would \nrevert to practices and policies in place prior to enforcement, including the fear of arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement, of the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n332.  Plaintiff Educators, Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational \nand  representational  capacity  are  entitled  to  injunctive  relief.  Plaintiff  Educators,  Plaintiff \nStudents, and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and gender sexuality alliance members have suffered \nand will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, \noperation, enforcement, and threat of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the vague \nGender Identity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Educators, Plaintiff Students, and Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student and gender sexuality alliance members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy \nat law.  \n90 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 91 of 177\n \n333.  Plaintiff  Educators  respectfully  request  injunctive  relief  that  enjoins  State \nDefendants from enforcing the Gender Identity Notification Provision. \n334.  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools  in  its  representational  capacity \nrespectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins All Defendants from enforcing the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision. \nIII. VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS  \nTO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION   \n335.  The  Library  Restriction,  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Prohibition,  and \nGender Identity Notification Provision, on their face, violate the First Amendment rights to receive \ninformation and engage in speech, expressive conduct, and expressive association.  \n336.  The First Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment \nand enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides in part that the government โshall make \nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . of the right of the people peaceably to assemble.โ  \n337.  In the case of private, noncurricular speech or expressive conduct in the school \nsetting, the right to engage in such speech and expressive conduct is unconstitutionally infringed \nupon when restricted despite not presenting a material and substantial interference with the \nrequirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of school or impinging upon the rights of \nother students.  \n338.  Government regulation of private speech based on viewpoint discrimination is \nsubject to strict scrutiny, requiring the government to demonstrate the restriction is narrowly \ntailored and necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.  \n339.  Government laws and actions violate the First Amendment when, taken as a whole, \nthey create a chilling effect that deters free speech and association rights because they target such \nexpression. \n91 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 92 of 177\n \n340.  In the case of speech or expressive conduct considered school-sponsored, the right \nto engage in such speech and expressive conduct is unconstitutionally infringed upon if the speech \nor expressive conduct is restricted without reasonable relation to a legitimate pedagogical concern. \n341.  In the school setting, the right to receive information is unconstitutionally infringed \nupon when information otherwise made available in the school is removed from studentsโ access \nwithout adequate governmental justification.  \nCount 1 \nSF 496 Is Facially Unconstitutional Because It Chills Student Speech \n  \n342.  The  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants.   \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n92 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 93 of 177\n \n343.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 335 through 341 as if fully set forth in this count. \n344.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law. \n345.  The  First  Amendment,  applicable  to  the  State  of  Iowa  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, provides in part that the government โshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom \nof speech.โ  \n346.  Discrimination against speech based on its content and viewpoint is a violation of \nthe First Amendment. Efforts to suppress speech based on the governmentโs opposition to the \nspeakerโs views or beliefs are unconstitutional absent narrow tailoring in service of a compelling \njustification. \n347.  On its face, as legislative history shows, and based on State Defendantsโ own \ninterpretation in this litigation, SF 496 is a faรงade for content and viewpoint discrimination. By \ndesign, the Library Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provisions of \nSF 496 are meant to suppress speech on the basis of viewpoint and content. SF 496 is facially \nunconstitutional under the First Amendment. \n348.  On its face and in its intent, purpose, and effect, SF 496 attempts to prescribe what \nshall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, most notably, the \ninclusion, affirmation, and support of LGBTQ+ students and persons. By design, the Library \nRestriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provisions of SF 496 collapse the \nspectrum of available knowledge, forbid the discussion of disfavored topics, and penalize the \nexpression of LGBTQ+ identity.  \n349.  SF 496 impermissibly chills the exercise of all Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student membersโ constitutionally protected speech based on the content and viewpoint \nof their speech and is unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs under the First Amendment. \n93 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 94 of 177\n \n350.  School District Defendants have implemented and unless enjoined will continue to \nimplement SF 496 in a way that explicitly censors messages of inclusion, affirmation, and support \nwith  respect  to  studentsโ  LGBTQ+  orientation  or  gender  identity.  SF  496  therefore  is \nunconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs and ISS Member Students under the First Amendment.  \n351.  The  First  Amendment  guarantees  Iowa  students  the  right  to  speak,  express \nthemselves, and associate with other like-minded students, including in schools. These rights  \ninclude the right to speak about and express their own gender identity or sexual orientation, to \naffirm their friendsโ or loved onesโ gender identity or sexual orientation, to ask questions of their \nteachers and trusted school staff members about gender identity and sexual orientation, to organize \ninto or join GSAs, to wear clothing consistent with their gender or that otherwise indicates that \nthey are members of the LGBTQ+ community, and to otherwise engage in conduct expressing \nmessages of inclusion, affirmation, and support for LGBTQ+ students and persons.  \n352.  Speech  and  expression  โrelating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientationโ  or \nโintended to affirm . . . gender identity,โ such as coming-out speech, is protected First Amendment \nactivity. So too is reading and discussing books and materials that express messages of support \nand inclusion for members of the LGBTQ+ community.  \n353.  The  Library  Restriction,  GISO  Prohibition,  and  Gender  Identity  Notification \nProvisions  of  SF  496  taken  together  chill  student  speech  and  expression  related  to  sexual \norientation and gender identity at all grade levels. By prohibiting speech related to gender identity \nor sexual orientation in kindergarten through sixth grade; requiring that educational programming \nfor all grades, including all activities in and outside of the classroom, exclude descriptions of sex \nacts; banning books from classrooms and libraries; mandating the outing of students to parents or \nguardians regardless of whether doing so would put the student at risk; inviting anonymous \n94 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 95 of 177\n \ncomplaints by parents; and enforcing the law via draconian penalties including the potential loss \nof licensure for school employees and loss of accreditation for schools, the law communicates to \nall LGBTQ+ students that they should remain silent.   \n354.  Accordingly, SF 496 on its face and the manner in which the Defendants are \nimplementing it impermissibly chills Plaintiffsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student membersโ speech \nand expression and causes them to self-censor. The Library Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and \nGender Identity Notification Provision, taken together, in their intent and purpose, as applied, and \nin effect, impermissibly infringe upon studentsโ expressive rights based upon the content of the \nexpression, the  message  they  mean  to  convey,  and  the  ideas  and  subject  matter  expressed \nindividually or as groups associated for that purpose, and on its face, infringes upon said rights \nbased upon the viewpoint of the speaker.  \n355.  SF 496 is not narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest.  \n356.  As  a  content-  and  viewpoint-based  regulation  that  is  neither  justified  by  a \ncompelling government interest nor narrowly tailored to achieve any arguable interest, SF 496 \nviolates studentsโ First Amendment rights.  \n357.  As a regulation of private, non-curricular student speech, SF 496 infringes upon \nstudentsโ expressive rights without any justification of a material and substantial interference with \nthe requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of school or an impingement upon the \nrights of other students. \n358.  As a regulation of student speech that may be considered school-sponsored, SF 496 \ninfringes  upon  studentsโ  expressive  rights  without  any  reasonable  relation  to  legitimate \npedagogical concerns and is thus unconstitutional. \n95 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 96 of 177\n \n359.  The  overbreadth  of  the  GISO  Prohibition  and  Gender  Identity  Notification \nProvision, together with the vagueness of those provisions and the Library Restriction, has created, \nand was intended to create, an environment in which the expression of LGBTQ+ identity or \nsupport for LGBTQ+ inclusion is discouraged. In an effort to comply with the broad prohibitions \nof SF 496 to avoid the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by State Defendants, \nschool districts across the state, including School District Defendants, have identified conflicting \nlists of books for removal disproportionately focused on books with LGBTQ+ characters or \naddressing LGBTQ+ issues, disparate rules for GSA participation falling uniquely upon these and \nno other student-led groups, differing understandings of where, when, or how the concepts of \ngender identity or sexual orientation can be discussed, and vastly different policies on the speech \nor expression that would necessitate a report to a studentโs parent or guardian, all underscoring the \noverbreadth and the vagueness of the law. This uncertainty among those charged with applying SF \n496, which is intended by those charged with enforcing it through disciplinary measures, naturally \ndeters and chills constitutionally protected speech as Plaintiff Students, Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student \nmembers, and other LGBTQ+ students not before the Court choose simply to abstain from \nprotected speech rather than undertake the risk of discipline for themselves or teachers.  \n360.  Moreover, the overbreadth and vagueness of SF 496 and the unpredictable and \ninconsistent efforts to comply with it have conveyed a message that LGBTQ+ people and their \nfamilies are not as worthy as others and that LGBTQ+ students are inherently vulgar, promiscuous, \nobscene, shameful, or inappropriate for school, further chilling Plaintiff Students, Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student members, and other LGBTQ+ students not before the Court from engaging in \nconstitutionally protected speech due to the stigma attached.  Abstaining from protected speech \nharms Plaintiffs and society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas. \n96 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 97 of 177\n \n361.  In the past, Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have \nengaged in protected speech and expression concerning their own or othersโ sexual orientation and \ngender identity in school contexts and with other students. They wish to continue to do so. \nHowever, because of SF 496, these Plaintiffs have been chilled and/or forced to self-censor by \ntaking care not to mention their own sexual orientation and/or gender identity, or otherwise \nengaging in related speech and expression in school contexts when they otherwise would do so.  \n362.  SF 496 stigmatizes and silences P.B.-P., chilling him from engaging in protected \nspeech acknowledging who he is and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community. Despite the \nbullying and harassment P.B.-P. experienced, he used to feel more comfortable wearing clothing \nor buttons in school with the Pride rainbow flag or other indicators that he is a member of the \nLGBTQ+ community. After passage of SF 496, however, his worries about being a target have \nreached a new high, and he now self-censors such expression. \n363.  P.B.-P. used to refer to his identity as transgender in class or related schoolwork \nwhen it was relevant, such as in essays on self-reflection, overcoming personal challenges, what \nhe would say to his younger self, and what it means to be American. Now that SF 496 has been \nenacted, he self-censors such references out of concerns for his own safety and fear that mentioning \nhis identity as transgender will get his teachers in trouble. Rather than correct peers and teachers \nwho use incorrect pronouns to refer to him, P.B.-P. now self-censors because he fears discipline \nand does not want to get a teacher in trouble during class for correcting his own pronouns. \n364.  SF 496 also chills P.B.-P. from engaging in speech protesting anti-LGBTQ+ \nlegislation affecting Iowa students. As a member of his schoolโs GSA during his freshman year, \nhe led a protest against such measures, gathering outside of the school. After SF 496 was passed, \nP.B.-P. feels terrified of staging another protest. The law has caused anti-LGBTQ sentiment to \n97 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 98 of 177\n \nincrease at his school, and students fear punishment from school officials for participating in such \na protest. \n365.  Plaintiff A.C. used to love school and could not wait to go every morning. But \nbecause of SF 496, she has become reluctant and fearful to go to school. A.C. now feels unsafe \nand as if she is being watched. A.C. is aware, even at her young age, that teachers whom she once \ntrusted are now not permitted to be sources of support to her, because of the law. A.C. is hurt, \nstressed, and upset as a result. The law sends A.C. the message that there is something wrong with \nher, and that she should be silenced and erased from school. \n366.  Plaintiff T.S. self-censors references to her identity in class, trying never to mention \nthat she is a lesbian because she fears that teachers will react poorly and crack down on students \nas a result of SF 496. T.S. has experienced bullying in the past targeting her identity as a lesbian. \nShe was called names, slurs, mocked, pushed to the ground, shoved into a locker, and bullied so \nharshly in science class that she repeatedly felt forced to go to a counselorโs room instead of to class. \nShe filled out at least 50 incident report sheets over the course of one year. She fears increased \nbullying as a result of SF 496. \n367.  SF 496 causes Plaintiff B.F. to feel unwanted, shameful, and unwelcome in school. \nIt interferes with B.F.โs relationship with teachers because B.F. self-censors mention of their \ngender identity and pronouns even to supportive teachers for fear of getting a teacher fired, and \nfor fear of harassment by other students who now feel encouraged to bully LGBTQ+ students as a \nresult of the law. In the past, fellow students have harassed B.F., calling them slurs, a slut, and \ntelling them to kill themself. Since SF 496 was passed, the harassment has become worse, making \nB.F. feel uncomfortable and less safe at school. \n98 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 99 of 177\n \n368.  The law has caused Plaintiff B.F.S. to feel as though they have a target on their \nback at school. B.F.S. already has experienced bullying in school for expressing their LGBTQ+ \nidentity, including on โCulture Day,โ when students were invited to wear flags celebrating diverse \ncultures. Because B.F.S. wore rainbow socks and a Pride flag, another student yelled, โJesus hates \nyou! Youโre going to hell!โ SF 496 sends the message to B.F.S. that students can expect this kind \nof targeted harassment if they express themselves as LGBTQ+. B.F.S. now thinks twice before \nwearing a Pride shirt, button, or anything else that expresses their identity and feels less safe at \nschool. \n369.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE is aware of other students who have been bullied based on \ntheir LGBTQ+ identities but fear telling teachers about the bullying because they do not wish to \nbe outed to their parents. DOE and other students are hesitant to bring up queer themes and topics \nin classes and outside of class in school for fear of getting teachers in trouble. \n370.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include individual students in Iowa public schools \nsubject to these provisions of SF 496. Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its representational capacity \nthe right of these members whose speech has been chilled by SF 496.  \n371.  Plaintiff Studentsโ, Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student membersโ, and other LGBTQ+ \nstudents not before the Courtโs speech is presently being chilled and will continue to be chilled as \nDefendants and their agents seek to enforce the law. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in \nits representational capacity on behalf of its student members are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief from the Defendants to remedy the deprivations suffered as a result of the \nviolations of their First Amendment rights.  \n99 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 100 of 177\n \n372.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ students, \nincluding the right of LGBTQ+ students to engage in speech and expressive conduct.  \n373.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโs claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.  \n374.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother, concerning the constitutionality of the Library Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender \nIdentity  Notification  Provision,  and  whether  they  violate  the  right  to  engage  in  speech  or \nexpressive conduct. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request a declaration \nfrom this Court that these provisions of SF 496 are unconstitutional.  \n375.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have suffered and \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, \nenforcement, and threat of enforcement of the Library Restriction, GISO Prohibition, and Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have \nno plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its \nrepresentational capacity respectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins State Defendants from \nenforcing these provisions of SF 496 and directs School District Defendants to restore any \nmaterials and revert any changes to school policy already made to comply with these provisions \nof SF 496. \n100 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 101 of 177\n \nCount 2  \nThe Library Restriction Unconstitutionally Infringes the  \nRight to Receive Information under the First Amendment \n  \n376.

The removal of these books and other materials from Iowa school libraries was \ndone, and will continue to be done, without a substantial or reasonable governmental interest, or \neven a legitimate pedagogical concern.  \n381.  The books and other materials that have been, or are at imminent risk of being, \nremoved supported and were consistent with Iowa schoolsโ central mission of educating Iowaโs \nchildren. The books and other materials in Iowa school libraries have been selected for inclusion \nafter being determined to be suitable for the developmental and social maturity of the grade or \ngrades for which the books and other materials are made available.  \n382.  Plaintiff Students are all students at Iowa public schools subject to the Library \nRestriction. All Plaintiff Studentsโ right to receive information has been infringed upon or is \nimminent danger of being infringed upon due to the Library Restriction.  \n383.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include individual students in Iowa public schools \nsubject to the Library Restriction.

State Defendants are responsible for enforcement of the Library Restriction. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought by  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its \nrepresentational capacity would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ enforcement of the \n102 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 103 of 177\n \nLibrary Restriction, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ membersโ local school districts \nwould make the removed books and materials available to them again, given all such books and \nmaterials previously included in these school libraries had already been deemed to be age \nappropriate and supportive of the schoolsโ and studentsโ educational goals.  \n387.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother, concerning the constitutionality of the Library Restriction and whether it violates the right \nto receive information. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request a declaration \nfrom this Court that the Library Restriction is unconstitutional.  \n388.   Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its  representational capacity are \nentitled to injunctive relief.

Plaintiff \nStudents and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at \nlaw. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity respectfully request \ninjunctive relief that enjoins State Defendants from enforcing the Library Restriction. \nCount 3  \nThe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition Unconstitutionally Infringes on the \nRight to Receive Information, and Engage in Speech and Expressive Conduct   \n \n389.

The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition has infringed upon studentsโ \nrights to receive information and engage in speech and expressive conduct.  \n392.  The GISO Prohibition has infringed upon studentsโ First Amendment right to \nreceive  information  by its the prohibition on classroom  activities that bear upon LGBTQ+ \nidentities and orientations, such as an in-class reading of a book featuring an LGBTQ+ character; \nthe prohibition of instruction on LGBTQ+ identities and orientations, such as explanation or \nguidance on gender identity in response to an incident of harassment or bullying; its prohibition \non  promotion  of  books  and  materials  with  LGBTQ+  characters  and  themes,  such  as  by \nrecommendation  or  display;  and,  to  the  extent  such  has  occurred  and  continues  to  occur \nnotwithstanding State Defendantsโ assertion that the GISO Prohibition does not apply to the \navailability of books in school libraries,  its requiring the removal of books with LGBTQ+ \ncharacters or themes.  \n393.  This  infringement  on studentsโ right  to  receive information does  not  serve a \nsubstantial and reasonable governmental interest or a legitimate pedagogical purpose.  \n394.  The GISO Prohibition has infringed upon studentsโ First Amendment right to \nengage in speech and expressive conduct by prohibiting classroom discussion of LGBTQ+ issues, \nsuch as a student project on the history of LGBTQ+ rights or an LGBTQ+ figure; prohibiting the \ndisplay of LGBTQ+ symbols, such as student placement of a flyer for an LGBTQ+ pride group; \nand chilling students from engaging in other speech or expressive conduct that would identify them \nas LGBTQ+, during and outside of classroom instructional time.  \n395.  To the extent this student speech or expressive conduct is school-sponsored, its \nrestriction is not justified by reasonable relation to a legitimate pedagogical concern. \n104 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 105 of 177\n \n396.  To the extent this student speech or expressive conduct is private, noncurricular \nspeech, its restriction is not justified by the presentation of a material and substantial interference \nwith the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of school or impinging upon the \nrights of other students.  \n397.  Student Plaintiff A.C. is a fifth-grade student in an Iowa public school subject to \nthe GISO Prohibition. Student Plaintiff A.C.โs First Amendment right to receive information has \nbeen infringed upon by the prohibition of instruction on LGBTQ+ issues in response to an incident \nof harassment or bullying; and the removal or prohibition on the promotion of books describing \nand explaining LGBTQ+ identities and orientation or otherwise featuring LGBTQ+ themes or \ncharacters, as well as the removal and prohibition on the promotion of symbols of LGBTQ+ \ninclusion.

Student  Plaintiff  A.C.โs  First \nAmendment right to engage in expressive association has been infringed upon by the prohibition \non the maintenance of a student-led, extracurricular GSA.  \n398.  Plaintiff Students are all students in Iowa public school districts subject to the GISO \nProhibition. All Plaintiff Studentsโ First Amendment right to speech and expressive conduct has \nbeen infringed upon as they have been chilled or forced to engage in self-censorship due to the \nGISO Prohibition.  \n399.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nmembers also include GSAs, including GSAs in kindergarten through sixth-grade schools. Iowa \n105 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 106 of 177\n \nSafe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of those student members whose \nrights to receive information and engage in speech and expressive conduct have been infringed \nupon by the GISO Prohibition.  \n400.

Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members. \n402.  State Defendants are responsible for enforcement of the GISO Prohibition. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief sought by  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its \nassociational capacities would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ enforcement of the \nGISO Prohibition, as Plaintiff Studentsโ and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student membersโ local school \ndistricts  would  revert  to  practices  and  policies  in  place  prior  to  enforcement  of  the  GISO \nProhibition. \n403.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother, concerning the constitutionality of the GISO Prohibition and whether it violates the right to \nreceive information or engage in speech or expressive conduct. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchools  respectfully  request  a  declaration  from  this  Court  that  the  GISO  Prohibition  is \nunconstitutional.  \n106 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 107 of 177\n \n404.

Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \n406.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 335 through 341 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n407.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision has infringed upon studentsโ right to \nengage in speech and expressive conduct by chilling them or forcing them to engage to engage in \nself-censorship, in that speech or expressive conduct that would reveal their gender identity, \nparticularly a gender identity different that that assigned to them at birth (โcoming outโ speech), \nwould result in a report to their parent or guardian without regard for their wishes and safety, or \nalternatively that they would put a trusted educator who refused to report them at risk for \ndisciplinary action, and therefore they have refrained from engaging in such speech or expressive \nconduct. Such speech or expressive conduct from which students have refrained and will continue \nto refrain while the Gender Identity Notification Provision is enforceable includes requesting or \nsignaling a request they be referred to by their proper name or pronoun, such as a verbal request \nor by displaying a pin, sticker, or other sign that indicates their chosen pronoun; participating \nopenly in a GSA or GSA event, such as by sharing their experience with their gender identity, \nasking other students for guidance and advice on seeking gender-affirmation socially, or promoting \ngender-affirming inclusive  school  policies;  seeking  and receiving  school  resources,  such  as \nmaking requesting support from teachers and administrators following an incident of anti-trans \nbullyingโwhether experienced as the victim or having witnessed another student victim, or \nmaking disclosures to a school-provided mental health counselor or social worker regarding theirs \nor anotherโs theirs or another studentโs struggles with a non-affirming home environment; or \notherwise expressing their own or supporting another studentโs expression of their gender identity.  \n108 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 109 of 177\n \n408.  To the extent this student speech or expressive conduct is school-sponsored, its \nrestriction is not justified by a legitimate pedagogical concern. \n409.  To the extent this student speech or expressive conduct is private, noncurricular \nspeech, its restriction is not justified by the presentation of a material and substantial interference \nwith the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of school or impinging upon the \nrights of other students.  \n410.  Plaintiff Students are all students in Iowa public school districts subject to the \nGender Identity Notification Provision.

There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother, concerning the constitutionality of the Gender Identity Notification Provision and whether \nit violates the right to receive information or engage in speech or expressive conduct. Plaintiff \nStudents and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request a declaration from this Court that the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision is unconstitutional. \n416.

Waterloo  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  Library \nRestriction infringes upon Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs First Amendment right to receive information.  \n420.  Plaintiff P.B.-P.  attends Waterloo West High School, in the Waterloo Community \nSchool District.  \n421.  Books by LGBTQ+ authors, or featuring LGBTQ+ characters or issues, are of great \nimportance to P.B.-P., as their presence on the school library shelves help him feel safe and \nwelcome. P.B.-P. enjoys reading such books, citing their importance to him in understanding his \nown gender identity and feeling a part of a community. Books P.B.-P. has found impactful include \nGracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky, Hell Followed With Us by Andrew Joseph White, Orlando \nby Virginia Woolf, Heartstopper by Alice Oceman, Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil \nGaiman, and Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston.  \n422.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. has and wishes to continue recommending books by LGBTQ+ \nauthors, or featuring LGBTQ+ characters or issues, to other students who he believes will benefit \nfrom reading them. For example, P.B.-P. has recommended and shared a copy of Gracefully \nGrayson.  \n423.  The Waterloo Community School District has not publicly identified the complete \nlist  of books  it has removed or will remove from  school  libraries pursuant to the  Library \nRestriction. However, the Waterloo Community School District has removed or will remove the \nfollowing from the Waterloo West High School building: All Boys Arenโt Blue by George M. \nJohnson, Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, Letโs Talk About It by Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan, \nLawn Boy by Jonathan Evison, and Lucky by Alice Sebold.  \n424.

Plaintiff P.B.-P. wishes to see these books and others that have been identified as \nsubject to removal under the law on the school library shelves for the affirming message their \ninclusion in the collection conveys; to have such books available on the shelves so that he can \ndiscover books relevant to him that he would like to read; to check these books out from the school \nlibrary and read them to learn the stories and information contained within them; to recommend, \nshare, and discuss these books to other students; and to do all of this without experiencing the \nstigmatization associated with enjoying books that the Library Restriction, its proponents, and \nthose school districts charged with applying it, have, expressly or implicitly, labeled inappropriate, \npornography,  sexually  explicit,  or  otherwise  unacceptable  in  the  school  environment,  and \nconsequently, the further stigmatization experienced as these terms are attached to those who wish \nto read or who share characteristics with the characters or themes highlighted by the books \nremoved.  \n426.  The removal of these books and other materials from the Waterloo West High \nSchool violates Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs right to receive information. The Waterloo Community School \nDistrict applying the Library Restriction to remove these books has done so without any substantial \nor reasonable governmental interest, or even a legitimate pedagogical concern.  \n427.  The books and other materials that have been removed from the Waterloo West \nHigh School had supported and were consistent with the Waterloo Community School Districtโs \ncentral mission of education of the students within its bounds.

Waterloo Community School District Defendants are responsible for applying the \nLibrary Restriction. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff P.B.-P. would redress \nthe harm caused by Waterloo Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Library \nRestriction, as the removed books and materials would be made available to P.B.-P. again.  \n429.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. is entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial \ncontroversy between P.B.-P. and Waterloo Community School District Defendants concerning the \nconstitutionality and application of the Library Restriction, including whether it has violated P.B.-\nP.โs right to receive information. Plaintiff P.B.-P. respectfully requests a declaration from this \nCourt that Waterloo Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Library Restriction \nis unconstitutional.  \n430.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  is  entitled  to  injunctive  relief.

Plaintiff T.S. further notes the importance of books with LGBTQ+ being displayed \nin school libraries, as it allowed her to discover new books of interest to read and expressed a \nmessage of LGBTQ+ inclusion. Plaintiff B.F. similarly expresses the importance of representation \non school library shelves.  \n450.  The Urbandale Community School District has currently identified at least 51 titles \nfor removal from schools within its district. This list was revised after public outcry on a far longer \nlist of titles subject to removal, including titles listed solely for their inclusion of LGBTQ+ \ncharacters and themes. Books identified on this list have been removed from the Urbandale High \nSchool.  \n451.  Plaintiff B.F. was insulted, degraded, and shamed by seeing books they have \nenjoyed, would like to read, or which include representation of their experience, on the list of \nbooks removed, and takes offense to the message sent that Plaintiff B.F. and their friends whose \nidentities are represented in the books removed were inappropriate to be in school. Plaintiff T.S. \nexperienced a feeling of being erased from school.  \n452.  Among the books that have been removed is Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia \nKobabe. Plaintiff T.S. wishes to check out Gender Queer from her school library and read it but \n117 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 118 of 177\n \nis unable to due to the Urbandale Community School District Defendantsโ application of the \nLibrary Restriction.  \n453.  Also among the books that have been removed are Call Me By Your Name by Andre \nAciman, and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. Plaintiff B.F. wishes to check out these books \nfrom their school library and read them but is unable to due to the Urbandale Community School \nDistrict Defendantsโ application of the Library Restriction.  \n454.  Plaintiff B.F. and T.S. wish to see these books and others that have been identified \nas subject to removal under the law on the school library shelves for the affirming message their \ninclusion in the collection conveys; to have such books available on the shelves so that they can \ndiscover books relevant to them that they would like to read; to check these books out from the \nschool library and read them to learn the stories and information contained within them; to \nrecommend, share, and discuss these books with other students; and to do all of this without \nexperiencing the stigmatization associated with enjoying books that the Library Restriction, its \nproponents, and those school districts charged with applying it, have, expressly or implicitly, \nlabeled inappropriate, pornography, sexually explicit, or otherwise unacceptable in the school \nenvironment, and consequently, the further stigmatization experienced as these terms are attached \nto those who wish to read or who share characteristics with the characters or themes highlighted \nby the books removed.  \n455.  The removal of these books and other materials from the Urbandale High School \nviolates  Plaintiff  B.F.โs  and  Plaintiff  T.S.โs  right  to  receive  information.  The  Urbandale \nCommunity School District applying the Library Restriction to remove these books has done so \nwithout any substantial or reasonable governmental interest, or even a legitimate pedagogical \nconcern.  \n118 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 119 of 177\n \n456.  The books and other materials that have been removed from the Urbandale High \nSchool had supported and were consistent with the Urbandale Community School Districtโs central \nmission of education of the students within its bounds. Such books and other materials were, in \nfact, selected for inclusion after being determined to be suitable for the developmental and social \nmaturity of the students attending Urbandale High School.  \n457.  Urbandale Community School District Defendants are responsible for applying the \nLibrary Restriction. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. would \nredress the harm caused by Urbandale Community School District Defendantsโ application of the \nLibrary Restriction, as the removed books and materials would be made available to B.F. and T.S. \nagain.  \n458.  Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. are entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and \nsubstantial  controversy between  Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. and  Urbandale Community School \nDistrict Defendants concerning Urbandale Community School District Defendantsโ application of \nthe Library Restriction, including whether it has violated B.F.โs and T.S.โs right to receive \ninformation. Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. respectfully request a declaration from this Court that \nUrbandale Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Library Restriction is \nunconstitutional.  \n459.  Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. are entitled to injunctive relief. B.F. and T.S. have suffered \nand will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence and \napplication of the Library Restriction. Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. have no plain, adequate, or speedy \nremedy at law. Plaintiffs B.F. and T.S. respectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants from applying the Library Restriction in this manner and \n119 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 120 of 177\n \ndirects Urbandale Community School District Defendants to return the books and materials \nremoved under their unconstitutional application of the Library Restriction. \nCount 8  \nAs Applied by West Des Moines Community Schools, the Library Restriction   \nUnconstitutionally Infringes on the Right to Receive Information \n \n460.  This count is brought by B.F.S, through their Parents and Next Friends, Brigit and \nJoseph Stevens,  against West Des Moines Community Schools Defendants. \n461.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 335 through 341 as if fully set forth in this count. \n462.  West Des Moines Community Schools Defendantsโ application of the Library \nRestriction infringes upon Plaintiff B.F.S.โs right to receive information.  \n463.  Plaintiff B.F.S. attends Valley Southwoods Freshman High School in the West Des \nMoines Community Schools district.  \n464.  Books by LGBTQ+ authors or featuring LGBTQ+ characters or issues are of great \nimportance to Plaintiff B.F.S. Plaintiff B.F.S. notes the importance of books with LGBTQ+ \nrepresentation being included in school libraries alongside books with representation of other \ngroups, in that their presence alongside such other books sends the message that nothing is wrong \nwith LGBTQ+ people.   \n465.  The Library Restriction has resulted in the removal of at least 47 titles from the \nWest Des Moines Community Schools district. Books on this list have been removed from Valley \nSouthwoods Freshman High School.  \n466.  Among the books removed are books by LGBTQ+ authors and featuring LGBTQ+ \ncharacters, which Plaintiff B.F.S. would otherwise wish to check out and read. Due to the Library \nRestriction, Plaintiff B.F.S. is unable to do so.  \n120 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 121 of 177\n \n467.  Plaintiff B.F.S. wishes to see these books and others that have been identified as \nsubject to removal under the law on the school library shelves for the affirming message their \ninclusion in the collection conveys; to have such books available on the shelves so that they can \ndiscover books relevant to her that they would like to read; to check these books out from the \nschool library and read them to learn the stories and information contained within them; to \nrecommend, share, and discuss these books with other students; and to do all of this without \nexperiencing the stigmatization associated with enjoying books that the Library Restriction, its \nproponents, and those school districts charged with applying it, have, expressly or implicitly, \nlabeled inappropriate, pornography, sexually explicit, or otherwise unacceptable in the school \nenvironment, and consequently, the further stigmatization experienced as these terms are attached \nto those who wish to read or who share characteristics with the characters or themes highlighted \nby the books removed.  \n468.  The removal of these books and other materials from Valley Southwoods Freshman \nHigh School violates Plaintiff B.F.S.โs right to receive information. The West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools district applying the Library Restriction to remove these books has done so \nwithout any substantial or reasonable governmental interest, or even a legitimate pedagogical \nconcern.  \n469.  The books and other materials that have been removed from Valley Southwoods \nFreshman High School had supported and were consistent with the West Des Moines Community \nSchoolsโ central mission of education of the students within its bounds. Such books and other \nmaterials were, in fact, selected for inclusion after being determined to be suitable for the \ndevelopmental and social maturity of the students attending Valley Southwoods Freshman High \nSchool.  \n121 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 122 of 177\n \n470.  West Des Moines Community Schools Defendants are responsible for applying the \nLibrary Restriction. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff B.F.S. would redress \nthe harm caused by West Des Moines Community Schools Defendantsโ application of the Library \nRestriction, as the removed books and materials would be made available to B.F.S. again.  \n471.  Plaintiff B.F.S. is entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial \ncontroversy between B.F.S. and West Des Moines Community Schools Defendants concerning \nWest  Des  Moines  Community  Schools  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  Library  Restriction, \nincluding whether it has violated B.F.S.โs right to receive information. Plaintiff B.F.S. respectfully \nrequests a declaration from this Court that West Des Moines Community Schools Defendantsโ \napplication of the Library Restriction is unconstitutional.  \n472.  Plaintiff B.F.S. is entitled to injunctive relief. B.F.S. has suffered and will continue \nto suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence and application of the \nLibrary Restriction. Plaintiff B.F.S. has no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff \nB.F.S. respectfully requests injunctive relief that enjoins West Des Moines Community Schools \nDefendants from applying the Library Restriction in this manner and directs West Des Moines \nCommunity  Schools  Defendants  to  return  the  books  and  materials  removed  under  their \nunconstitutional application of the Library Restriction. \nCount 9  \nAs Applied by Sioux City Community Schools, the Library Restriction   \nUnconstitutionally Infringes on the Right to Receive Information \n  \n473.  This count is brought by James Doe, through his Parent and Next Friend, John \nDoe, against Sioux City Community Schools Defendants. \n474.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 335 through 341 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n122 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 123 of 177\n \n475.  Sioux City Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Library \nRestriction infringes upon Plaintiff James Doeโs right to receive information.  \n476.  Plaintiff Doe attends a high school in the Sioux City Community School District.  \n477.  Books by LGBTQ+ authors or featuring LGBTQ+ characters or issues, as well as \nbooks with advanced subject matter, are of great importance to Plaintiff Doe. Plaintiff Doe takes \nadvanced reading courses and wishes to access books that will help him excel in this coursework \nand prepare him for college. Plaintiff Doe further wishes to see his identity reflected on school \nlibrary shelves for the destigmatizing effect this has.  \n478.  The Sioux City Community School District has not publicly identified the titles it \nhas removed or will remove pursuant to the Library Restriction. However, books have been \nremoved or imminently will be removed from Plaintiff Doeโs high school pursuant to the Library \nRestriction.   \n479.  Plaintiff Doe wishes to access books reflecting his identity, as well as books that \nwill aid him in his coursework and prepare him for college. However, because of the Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendantsโ application of the Library Restriction, Plaintiff Doeโs \nability to discover and access such books has been restricted.  \n480.  Plaintiff Doe wishes to see these books and others that have been identified as \nsubject to removal under the law on the school library shelves for the affirming message their \ninclusion in the collection conveys; to have such books available on the shelves so that he can \ndiscover books relevant to him that he would like to read; to check these books out from the school \nlibrary and read them to learn the stories and information contained within them; to recommend, \nshare, and discuss these books with other students; and to do all of this without experiencing the \nstigmatization associated with enjoying books that the Library Restriction, its proponents, and \n123 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 124 of 177\n \nthose school districts charged with applying it, have, expressly or implicitly, labeled inappropriate, \npornography,  sexually  explicit,  or  otherwise  unacceptable  in  the  school  environment,  and \nconsequently, the further stigmatization experienced as these terms are attached to those who wish \nto read or who share characteristics with the characters or themes highlighted by the books \nremoved. \n481.  The removal of these books and other materials from Doeโs high school violates \nPlaintiff  Doeโs  right  to  receive  information.  The  Sioux  City  Community  School  District \nDefendants applying the Library Restriction to remove these books has done so without any \nsubstantial or reasonable governmental interest, or even a legitimate pedagogical concern. \n482.  The books and other materials that have been removed from Doeโs high school had \nsupported and were consistent with Sioux City Community School Districtโs central mission of \neducation of the students within its bounds. Such books and other materials were, in fact, selected \nfor inclusion after being determined to be suitable for the developmental and social maturity of the \nstudents attending Doeโs high school. \n483.  Sioux City Community School District Defendants are responsible for applying the \nLibrary Restriction. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff Doe would redress \nthe harm caused by Sioux City Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Library \nRestriction, as the removed books and materials would be made available to Doe again. \n484.  Plaintiff Doe is entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial \ncontroversy between Doe and Sioux City Community School District Defendants concerning \nSioux  City  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  Library  Restriction, \nincluding whether it has violated Doeโs right to receive information. Plaintiff Doe respectfully \n124 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 125 of 177\n \nrequests a declaration from this Court that Sioux City Community School District Defendantsโ \napplication of the Library Restriction is unconstitutional. \n485.  Plaintiff Doe is entitled to injunctive relief. Doe has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence and application of the \nLibrary Restriction. Plaintiff Doe has no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Doe \nrespectfully  requests  injunctive  relief  that  enjoins  Sioux  City  Community  School  District \nDefendants  from  applying  the  Library  Restriction  in  this  manner  and  directs  Sioux  City \nCommunity School District Defendants to return the books and materials removed under their \nunconstitutional application of the Library Restriction. \nCount 10  \nAs Applied by Iowa City Community School District, the  \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition Unconstitutionally  \nInfringes on the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression \n  \n486.  This count is brought by A.C, through her Parents and Next Friends, Richard \nCarlson and Ulrike Carlson, and Iowa Safe Schools Behalf of its Members in the Iowa City \nCommunity School District against Iowa City Community School District Defendants  \n487.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 335 through 341 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n488.  Iowa City Community School District Defendantsโ application of the Gender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition has infringed upon Plaintiff A.C.โs First Amendment rights \nto receive information and engage in speech and expressive conduct.  \n489.  Iowa  City  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  GISO \nProhibition has further infringed upon the same rights of Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members in \nthe Iowa City Community School District.  \n490.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ students, \n125 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 126 of 177\n \nincluding the rights of LGBTQ+ students to receive information relating to gender identity or \nsexual orientation and to engage in speech and expressive conduct that relates to gender identity \nor sexual orientation.  \n491.  Iowa  Safe  Schoolsโ  claim  on  behalf  of  student  members  in  the  Iowa  City \nCommunity School District does not require the participation of its individual members.   \n492.  Plaintiff  A.C.โs  parents,  Richard  Carlson  and  Ulrike  Carlson,  consider  the \navailability of  information related  to LGBTQ+ issues in  the school environment extremely \nimportant to A.C.โs safety and overall success at her elementary school. The Carlsons note Iowa \nCity Community School District Defendantsโ removal of all messages of support for LGBTQ+ \nidentities,  such  as  pride  flags  and  โsafe  spaceโ  stickers,  made  A.C.  feel  singled  out  and \nunwelcomed for her differences. Ulrike Carlson notes the inability of A.C.โs educators to confront \nanti-trans bullying without providing information on gender identity, and the consequent negative \neffect this has had upon A.C.โs school experience. Richard Carlson notes A.C.โs fears that \nprompting in-class discussion of LGBTQ+ issues would be prohibited or lead to discipline. The \nCarlsons further note the removal, or potential removal, of books by LGBTQ+ authors or featuring \nLGBTQ+ characters from school libraries, as well as the prohibition on in-class or extracurricular \nreadings of such books, and that these applications of the GISO Prohibition have made A.C. feel \nalienated and like an outcast.  \n493.  Iowa  Safe  Schoolsโ  members  include  LGBTQ+  students  in  the  Iowa  City \nCommunity School District, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. \nSuch members have experienced the same or substantially similar infringements upon their right \nto receive information as those articulated by A.C. through her parents, due to the Iowa City \nCommunity School District Defendantsโ application of the GISO Prohibition.  \n126 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 127 of 177\n \n494.  Iowa  City  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  GISO \nProhibition has infringed upon Plaintiff A.C.โs and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members in the \nIowa City Community School Districtโs First Amendment right to receive information by its the \nprohibition on classroom activities that bear upon LGBTQ+ identities and orientations, such as an \nin-class reading of a book featuring an LGBTQ+ character; the prohibition of instruction on \nLGBTQ+ identities and orientations, such as explanation or guidance on gender identity in \nresponse to an incident of harassment or bullying; its prohibition on promotion of books and \nmaterials with LGBTQ+ characters and themes, such as by recommendation or display; and, to the \nextent such has occurred and continues to occur notwithstanding State Defendantsโ assertion that \nthe GISO Prohibition does not apply to the availability of books in school libraries, its requiring \nthe removal of books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes.  \n495.   Iowa City Community School District Defendantsโ infringement upon Plaintiff \nA.C.โs and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members in the Iowa City Community School Districtโs \nright to receive information does not serve a substantial and reasonable governmental interest or a \nlegitimate pedagogical purpose.  \n496.  The information, books, materials, or other message relating to gender identity or \nsexual orientation previously contained within Plaintiff A.C.โs elementary school and the schools \nof Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members in the Iowa City Community School District had supported \nand were consistent with the Iowa City Community School Districtโs central mission of education \nof the students within its bounds. Such information, books, materials, and other messages were, in \nfact, selected for inclusion after being determined to be suitable for the developmental and social \nmaturity of the students attending Plaintiff A.C.โs elementary school and the schools of Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student members in the Iowa City Community School District.  \n127 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 128 of 177\n \n497.  Iowa  City  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  GISO \nProhibition has further infringed upon Plaintiff A.C.โs and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members \nin the Iowa City Community School Districtโs First Amendment right to engage in speech and \nexpressive conduct.  \n498.  Plaintiff A.C. has, due to the Iowa City Community School District Defendantsโ \napplication of the GISO Prohibition, been chilled from protected expression and has otherwise \nbeen forced to engage in self-censorship. Richard Carlson notes A.C.โs fear of expressing herself \nas a transgender girl in the classroom, giving a presentation on transgender rights, or asking \nquestions about the gender identity or sexual orientation of a books characters. Ulrike Carlson \nnotes A.C. has avoided wearing clothing to school that might reveal her biological sex and has \nrefrained from sharing her identity as a transgender girl.   \n499.  Iowa  Safe  Schoolsโ  members  include  LGBTQ+  students  in  the  Iowa  City \nCommunity School District, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. \nSuch members have experienced the same or substantially similar infringements upon their right \nto engage in speech and expressive conduct as those articulated by A.C. through her parents, due \nto the Iowa City Community School District Defendantsโ application of the GISO Prohibition. \n500.  To the extent such speech or expressive conduct is school-sponsored, Iowa City \nCommunity School District Defendantsโ restriction of it is not justified by reasonable relation to a \nlegitimate pedagogical concern.  \n501.  To the extent such speech or expressive conduct is private, noncurricular speech, \nIowa  City  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  restriction  of  it  is  not  justified  by  the \npresentation of a material and substantial interference with the requirements of appropriate \ndiscipline in the operation of school or an impingement upon the rights of other students.  \n128 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 129 of 177\n \n502.  Iowa City Community School District Defendants are responsible for applying the \nGISO Prohibition. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe \nSchools on behalf of its student members in the Iowa City Community School District would \nredress the harm caused by Iowa City Community School District Defendantsโ application of the \nGISO Prohibition, in that the information, books, materials, and other messages relating to gender \nidentity or sexual orientation would be returned or permitted, and the restrictions on expressive \nconduct would be lifted.  \n503.  Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe Schools on behalf of its student members in the Iowa \nCity Community School District are entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial \ncontroversy between Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe Schools on behalf of its student members in the \nIowa City Community School District on the one hand, and Iowa City Community School District \nDefendants on the other, concerning the constitutionality of Iowa City Community School District \nDefendantsโ application of the GISO Prohibition and whether it violates the right to receive \ninformation or engage in speech or expressive conduct. Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe Schools \nrespectfully request a declaration from this Court that Iowa City Community School District \nDefendantsโ application of the GISO Prohibition is unconstitutional.  \n504.  Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe Schools on behalf of its student members in the Iowa \nCity Community School District are entitled to injunctive relief. Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student members in the Iowa City Community School District have suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendantsโ application of the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ student members in the Iowa City Community School District have no plain, adequate, \nor speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff A.C. and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request injunctive relief \n129 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 130 of 177\n \nthat enjoins Iowa City Community School District Defendants from applying the GISO Prohibition \nin this manner and directs Iowa City Community School District Defendants to restore and permit \nthe dissemination of all information, books, materials, and other messages removed pursuant to \ntheir application of the GISO Prohibition and to revert to the policies and practices in place with \nrespect to student expression prior to their unconstitutional application of the GISO Prohibition.   \nIV. VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT OF EXPRESSIVE \nASSOCIATION \n505.  SF 496, on its face and as  applied, violates the  First  Amendmentโs right  of \nexpressive association.  \n506.  The  First  Amendment,  applicable  to  the  State  of  Iowa  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, provides in part that the government โshall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right \nof the people peaceably to assemble.โ \n507.  On  its  face  and  as  applied,  the  GISO  Prohibition  and  the  Gender  Identity \nNotification Requirement of SF 496 violate the rights of the Named-Plaintiff Student GSA \nMembers, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA members, and other students, to \nfreedom of expressive association under the First Amendment to the Constitution.   \n508.  Defendants have created and maintain a limited public forum for student expression \nand association from which they have excluded the Named-Plaintiff Student GSA Members, \nPlaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA members, and other students not before the \nCourt from access on terms equal to others in a manner that constitutes viewpoint discrimination \nand that was and is unreasonable in light of the purposes the forum serves. \n509.  Defendants have discriminated and are continuing to discriminate against the \nNamed-Plaintiff Student GSA Members, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA \n130 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 131 of 177\n \nmembers, and other students based upon the viewpoint and content of their expression and \nexpressive association. \n510.  By restricting the ability of the Named-Plaintiff Student GSA Members, Plaintiff \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA members, and other students to express themselves \nand associate with others in student groups on equal terms to other student groups, Defendants \nhave prohibited and unless enjoined will continue to prohibit the Named-Plaintiff Student GSA \nMembers, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA members, and other students not \nbefore the Court from enjoying the support, inclusion, and affirmation such groups provide, \ncausing irreparable harm.  \n511.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496 to prohibit students from becoming members of GSAs or attending GSA \nmeetings and events or to prohibit GSAs from advertising or promoting their group, or to otherwise \ninterfere with the lawful conduct of the GSAs. The Named-Plaintiff Student GSA Members and \nPlaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ student and GSA members all will suffer irreparable injury \nand will continue to suffer real and immediate threat of irreparable injury as a direct and proximate \nresult of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement of SF 496. Plaintiffs \nhave no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law.    \n512.  Additionally, Defendantsโ enforcement of SF 496 has directly injured IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLS, causing it to divert its own resources to address the illegality of SF 496 and frustrating \nits  mission  of  securing  safe  and  affirming  school  environments  for  Iowa  students.  Unless \nDefendants are enjoined, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS will continue to suffer real and \nimmediate threat of irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, \nenforcement, and threat of enforcement of SF 496.  \n131 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 132 of 177\n \nCount 1  \nThe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition is Facially Unconstitutional  \nBecause It Violates the First Amendment Right to Freedom of Expressive Association \n  \n513.  The  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its Individual Student Members, against All Defendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants. \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants. \n514.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 505 through 512 as if fully set in this count.  \n515.  The GISO Prohibition has resulted in restrictions on GSAs that inhibit their ability \nto advertise, convene, and pursue their mission of providing a safe and inclusive environment for \nLGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+ allied students to meet and build community and awareness of LGBTQ+ \ntopics.  \n132 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 133 of 177\n \n516.  The GISO Prohibition violates the expressive association rights of ISS member \nstudents, including the GSA-member Plaintiff Students, by preventing them from full and equal \nenjoyment  of  their  student-led  noncurricular  group  on  equal  terms  as  other  student-led \nnoncurricular groups that are not formed to discuss viewpoints and content related to LGBTQ+ \npeople. \n517.  The GISO Prohibition prevents students in Kindergarten through 6th grade from \njoining GSAs. Accordingly, the GISO Prohibition directly deprives those K-6 students of the \nbenefit of joining the expressive association of their choice. The GISO Prohibition also deprives \nother students of the benefit of the membership of those K-6 students. \n518.  ISS member GSAs in schools that include K-6 students must now comply with \nonerous restrictions on their ability to advertise the club, such as being prevented from making \nschoolwide  announcements  or  posting  posters  and  flyers  in  common  areas,  because  such \nadvertising would conflict with the GISO Prohibition. On information and belief, no other student \ngroups are similarly restricted in this way. \n519.  ISS member GSAs in schools that include K-6 students require 5th and 6th grade \nstudents to obtain parental permission prior to joining the GSA. On information and belief, no \nother student groups require parental permission for attendance at regular meetings.  \n520.  At least one ISS member GSA has voluntarily ceased to operate, because the school \nprohibited 5th and 6th grade students from joining the GSA at all and required parental permission \nfor 7th and 8th grader students prior to joining the GSA. \n521.  On its face and as applied, the GISO Prohibition violates the rights of the Plaintiff \nStudent GSA Members, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs student and GSA members, and other \nstudents to freedom of expressive association under the First Amendment to the Constitution.   \n133 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 134 of 177\n \n522.  The State Defendants have abridged and are continuing to abridge the right to \nfreedom of expressive association of the Plaintiff Student GSA Members, Plaintiff IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLSโ student and GSA members, and other students by adopting and enforcing the GISO \nProhibition.  \n523.  State  Defendants  are  responsible  for  adoption  and  enforcement  of  the  GISO \nProhibition. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by GSA-member Plaintiff Students and \nISS in its representational capacity would redress the harm caused by State Defendantsโ adoption \nand enforcement of the GISO Prohibition, as GSA-member Plaintiff Studentsโ and ISS membersโ \nlocal school districts would remove all restrictions that inhibit the ability of GSAs to operate on \nthe same terms as other extracurricular groups, and on the same terms upon which GSAs had \nalready been operating without incident prior to the adoption of the GISO Prohibition. \n524.  GSA-member Plaintiff Students and ISS in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. GSA-member Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโs student and GSA \nmembers have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate \nresult of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement of the GISO Prohibition. \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโs student members have no plain, adequate, or speedy \nremedy  at  law.  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools  in  its  representational  capacity \nrespectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins All Defendants from enforcing the terms of the \nGISO Prohibition against GSAs in any form. \nCount 2   \nAs Applied by the State Defendants, the Gender Identity Notification Provision   \nUnconstitutionally Infringes on the Right to Freedom of Expressive Association  \n  \n525.  This  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nRepresentational Capacity on behalf of its GSAs and Individual Student Members, Against State \n134 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 135 of 177\n \nDefendants. \n526.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 505 through 512 as if fully set in this count.  \n527.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision has resulted in restrictions on GSAs \nthat inhibit their ability to advertise, convene, and pursue their mission of providing a safe and \ninclusive environment for LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ+ allied students to meet and build community \nand awareness of LGBTQ+ topics.  \n528.  Plaintiff P.B.-P.  is an officer of his high schoolโs GSA, which is a member of Iowa \nSafe Schools.  \n529.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. knows students who are afraid to join the GSA because of fear that \nthey will be outed to their parents or guardians in accordance with SF 496โs Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. \n530.  Plaintiff James Doe is an officer of his high schoolโs GSA, which is a member of \nIowa Safe Schools.  \n531.  Plaintiff James Doe knows fellow students who would like to join the GSA but who \nwill not because they are afraid of the consequences at home if they are outed to their parents or \nguardians in accordance with SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision. \n532.  Some ISS member GSAs have voluntarily ceased to operate entirely for fear of \ntriggering the Gender Identity Notification Provision. Other ISS member GSAs have been forced \nto cease operation because teachers or school administrators feared triggering the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision.  \n533.  State Defendants are responsible for adoption and enforcement of the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by GSA-member \nPlaintiff Students and ISS in its representational capacity would redress the harm caused by State \n135 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 136 of 177\n \nDefendantsโ adoption and enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision, as GSA-\nmember Plaintiff Students and ISS membersโ local school districts would remove all enforcement \nof the Gender Identity Notification Provision against GSAs or against speech which occurs within \nthe purview of a GSA pursuing its mission, which would return GSAs to the same position that \nthey occupied without incident prior to the adoption of the Gender Identity Notification Provision. \n534.  GSA-member Plaintiff Students and ISS in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. GSA-member Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and GSA \nmembers have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate \nresult of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement of the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members have no plain, \nadequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational \ncapacity respectfully request injunctive relief that enjoins State Defendants from enforcing the \nterms  of  the  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision  against  GSAs  or  any  other  student  or \nextracurricular student group in any form. \nCount 3   \nAs Applied by Iowa City Community School District, the  \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition Unconstitutionally Infringes on the  \nRight to Freedom of Expressive Association  \n535.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against Defendants MATT DEGNER, in his official \ncapacity as Iowa City Community School District Superintendent; and MOLLY ABRAHAM, \nSHAWN EYESTONE, CHARLIE EASTHAM, JAYNE FINCH, RUTHINA MALONE, MITCH \nLINGO, and LISA WILLIAMS, in their official capacities as board members of the Iowa City \nCommunity School District (together โIowa City Community School Districtโ). \n536.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 505 through 512 as if fully set in this count.  \n136 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 137 of 177\n \n537.  Student  Plaintiff  A.C.  further  challenges  the  Gender  Identity  and  Sexual \nOrientation Prohibition as unconstitutional as it is applied to her due to its infringement upon her \nFirst Amendment right to expressive association. A.C. brings this claim against Iowa Community \nSchool District Defendants.  \n538.  Student  Plaintiff  A.C.  further  challenges  the  Gender  Identity  and  Sexual \nOrientation Prohibition as unconstitutional as it is applied to her due to its infringement upon her \nFirst Amendment right to expressive association. A.C. brings this claim against Iowa Community \nSchool District Defendants.  \n539.  Iowa Safe Schools, on behalf of its members in the Iowa City Community School \nDistrict, joins A.C. in this challenge. \n540.  By restricting the ability of A.C., Iowa Safe Schools members, and other students \nto express themselves and associate with others in student groups on equal terms to other student \ngroups, Defendants have prohibited and, unless enjoined, will continue to prohibit the rights of \nA.C., Iowa Safe Schools members, and other students not before the Court from enjoying the \nsupport, inclusion, and affirmation such groups provide, causing irreparable harm.   \nCount 4  \nAs Applied by Waterloo Community School District, the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision Unconstitutionally Infringes on the Freedom of Expressive Association  \n  \n541.  Student Plaintiff P.B.-P. states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nJARED SMITH, in his official capacity as Waterloo Community School District Superintendent; \nand JONATHAN COX, JESSE KNIGHT, ASTOR WILLIAMS, LYLE SCHMITT, STACIE \nMILLS, JANELLE EWING, and KRYSTAL MADLOCK, in their official capacities as board \nmembers of the Waterloo Community School District (together โWaterloo Community School \nDistrictโ). \n137 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 138 of 177\n \n542.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 505 through 512 as if fully set in this count. \n543.  Waterloo  Community  School  District  Defendantsโ  application  of  the  Library \nRestriction infringes upon Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs First Amendment right to receive information. \n544.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. attends Waterloo West High School, in the Waterloo Community \nSchool District. \n545.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. is an officer of his high schoolโs GSA, which is a member of Iowa \nSafe Schools.  \n546.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. knows students who are afraid to join the GSA because of fear that \nthey will be outed to their parents or guardians in accordance with SF 496โs Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. \n547.  The reluctance of other LGBTQ+ students to join the GSA because of SF 496 \ndiminishes Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs own experience of community in and through the GSA.  \n548.  The reluctance of other students to join the GSA because of SF 496 has also resulted \nin a smaller pool of students available to take on leadership positions within the GSA, threatening \nits ability to remain an ongoing concern. \nCount 5  \nAs Applied by Sioux City Community School District, the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision Unconstitutionally Infringes on the Freedom of Expressive Association  \n549.   The count is brought by James Doe, through his Parent and Next Friend John Doe, \nand Iowa Safe Schools, on Behalf of Its Members in the Sioux City Community School District, \nagainst Sioux City Community School District Defendants \n550.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 505 through 512 as if fully set in this count. \n551.  Student Plaintiff James Doe further challenges the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision Orientation Restriction as unconstitutional as it is applied to him due to its infringement \n138 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 139 of 177\n \nupon his First Amendment right to expressive association. JAMES DOE states this claim against \nDefendants ROD EARLEYWINE, in his official capacity as Sioux City Community School \nDistrict Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, LANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA \nLEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, and EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as \nboard members of the Sioux City Community School District (together, โSioux City Community \nSchool Districtโ). \n552.  Plaintiff James Doe attends a high school in the Sioux City Community School \nDistrict. \n553.  Plaintiff James Doe is an officer of his high schoolโs GSA, which is a member of \nIowa Safe Schools.  \n554.  Plaintiff James Doe knows fellow students who would like to join the GSA but who \nwill not because they are afraid of the consequences at home if they are outed to their parents or \nguardians in accordance with SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision. \n555.  The reluctance of other LGBTQ+ students to join the GSA because of SF 496 \ndiminishes James Doeโs own experience of community in and through the GSA.  \n556.  No other student groups at James Doeโs high school have experienced similar \nchallenges or harms. \n557.  The restrictions on the ability of James Doe to interact and participate with his GSA, \nand on the ability of the GSA to meet on the same terms as any other student group, violates James \nDoeโs right to expressive association. \n558.  Plaintiff Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include individual students in Sioux City \nCommunity School District schools subject to the Gender Identity Notification Provision. Iowa \n139 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 140 of 177\n \nSafe  Schools  asserts  in  its  representational  capacity  the  right  of  these  members  to  receive \ninformation, infringed upon by the Gender Identity Notification Provision. \n559.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to form community with one another safely on \nthe same terms as other student groups and with all of the same benefits provided to those groups \nby their schools.  \n560.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.  \n561.  The Sioux City Community School District is responsible for the application, \nimplementation, and enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision. The declaratory \nand injunctive relief sought  by Plaintiff James Doe and Plaintiff Iowa Safe Schools in  its \nrepresentational capacity on behalf of ISS member students in the Sioux City Community School \nDistrict would redress the harm caused by Sioux City Community School District application of \nthe Gender Identity Notification Provision, and would allow James Doe and ISS members to enjoy \ntheir full rights to expressive association. \n562.  Plaintiffs James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are \nentitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between these plaintiffs \nand the Sioux City Community School District Defendants concerning the constitutionality and \napplication of the Gender Identity Notification Provision, including whether it has violated these \nPlaintiffsโ right to expressive association. Plaintiff James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its \nrepresentational  capacity  respectfully  request  a  declaration  from  this  Court  that  Sioux  City \n140 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 141 of 177\n \nCommunity School District Defendantsโ application of the Gender Identity Notification Provision \nis unconstitutional.  \n563.  Plaintiff James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are \nentitled to injunctive relief. These plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable \ninjury as a direct and proximate result of the existence and application of the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. These plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff \nJames Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity respectfully request injunctive \nrelief that enjoins Sioux City Community School District Defendants from applying the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision in a manner which violates their rights to expressive association. \nV. VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT \n564.  SF 496, on its face and as applied, as a whole and with respect to the Gender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition and Gender Identity Notification Provision, violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n565.  The Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides \nthat โ[n]o state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ \n566.  When determining whether a classification based on sex, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity,  or  transgender  status  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  courts  must  view  that \nclassification with heightened scrutiny, as these traits โgenerally provide no sensible ground for \ndifferential treatment.โ  \n567.  As a result, the state must provide an โexceedingly persuasive justificationโ for \nlaws that differentiate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status. \nIf the state cannot provide such a justification, the law is unconstitutional. \n141 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 142 of 177\n \nCount 1  \nSF496 Is Motivated by Animus and, Thus, Facially Unconstitutional  \nas a Violation of Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment  \n  \n568.  This  count  is  brought  by  Plaintiff  Students  and  Iowa  Safe  Schools,  in  its \nrepresentational capacity on behalf of its GSAs and individual student members, against State \nDefendants. \na.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS, in its representational capacity on behalf of its \nstudent members, states this claim against State Defendants, and against School \nDistrict Defendants. \nb.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Waterloo \nCommunity School District Defendants.  \nc.  Plaintiff A.C. states this claim against State Defendants and Iowa City Community \nSchool District Defendants. \nd.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants and Urbandale \nCommunity School District Defendants. \ne.  Plaintiff B.F.S. states this claim against State Defendants and West Des Moines \nCommunity Schools Defendants.  \nf.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Sioux City \nCommunity School District Defendants. \n569.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 564 through 567 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n570.  SF 496 was enacted with the purpose of and has the effect of discriminating against \nLGBTQ+ students, subjecting them to differential and adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status. \n142 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 143 of 177\n \n571.  State Defendants, who are responsible for the adoption and implementation of SF \n496, do not, and cannot, offer any legitimate governmental purpose for SF 496โs differential \ntreatment of LGBTQ+ students on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and \ntransgender status. \n572.  SF  496  serves  no  legitimate  governmental  purpose,  let  alone  an  exceedingly \npersuasive or compelling one. \n573.  The legislative history, context, and process surrounding SF 496 make abundantly \nclear that this discrimination against LGBTQ+ students was a motivating factor behind the lawโs \npassage.   \n574.  The text of the law further affirms that SF 496 discriminates against LGBTQ+ \nstudents. For example, the Gender Identity Notification Provision explicitly targets LGBTQ+ \nstudents on the basis of their gender identity or transgender status, by requiring school officials to \nnotify a studentโs parent or guardian whenever a student asks school officials to โaffirm the \nstudentโs gender identityโ by using a name or pronoun that is different from those in their school \nrecords. The Gender Identity Notification Provision makes no such requirement for non-LGBTQ+ \nstudents whose gender identities, names, and pronouns align with those in their school records. \n575.  Plaintiff Students are all students at Iowa public schools subject to SF 496. All \nPlaintiff Students have been directly and irreparably harmed by SF 496, which discriminates \nagainst them and subjects them to differential and adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status.   \n576.  Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of its members, \nwhich include both individual students and GSAs in Iowa public schools. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nstudent members and member GSAs have been directly and irreparably harmed by SF 496, which \n143 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 144 of 177\n \ndiscriminates against them and subjects them to differential and adverse treatment on the basis of \ntheir sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status, or, in the case of Iowa Safe \nSchoolsโ member GSAs, the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status of their \nmembers.  \n577.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ students, \nincluding the right of LGBTQ+ students to be free from discrimination and adverse treatment on \nthe basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status.  \n578.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.  \n579.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought would redress the harm caused by SF \n496 State Defendantsโ unconstitutional adoption, implementation, and enforcement of SF 496. \n580.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between Plaintiff Students and \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on the one hand, and State Defendants on the \nother,  concerning  the  constitutionality,  and  specifically  the  unjustifiable  discriminatory \nmotivation, of SF 496. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully request a declaration \nthat SF 496 is unconstitutional due to its discriminatory motivation.  \n581.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student members and member GSAs \nhave suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the \nadoption, implementation, and enforcement of SF 496. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nstudent members and member GSAs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff \n144 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 145 of 177\n \nStudents  and  Iowa  Safe  Schoolsโ  student  members  and member  GSAs  respectfully  request \ninjunctive relief that enjoins State Defendants from enforcing SF 496.  \nCount 2 \nAs Applied to Transgender, as well as Gender Nonconforming or Questioning Students,  \nthe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition \nViolates Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment  \n \n582.  This count is brought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools, both for direct \ninjury to itself as an organization and in its representational capacity, on behalf of its GSAs and \nindividual student members, against State Defendants. \n583.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 564 through 567 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n584.  SF 496โs GISO Prohibition has resulted in the differential and adverse treatment of \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools, both as an organization and in its representational \nCapacity on behalf of its GSAs and Individual Student Members, on the basis of their sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity, and transgender status, thus violating their Equal Protection rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \n585.  SF 496โs GISO Prohibition forbids any mention of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity from kindergarten through the sixth grade, encompassing all activities within a school, in \nor outside of the classroom. \n586.  Although  SF  496  uses  broad  definitions  of  โgender  identityโ  and  โsexual \norientation,โ even a facially neutral law can violate the Equal Protection Clause if it has a \ndiscriminatory purpose and effect. SF 496 has both a discriminatory purpose and effect, for the \nreasons explained above. \n587.  When read as written and taken literally, the language of the GISO Prohibition \nappears facially neutral, and would therefore prohibit any reference whatsoever to any gender \n145 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 146 of 177\n \nidentity or sexual orientation in grades K-6, including any reference to heterosexuality or cisgender \nidentities. \n588.  Notwithstanding  the  seemingly  facially  neutral  language  within  the  GISO \nProhibition, this portion of the law has been widely interpreted as restricting only discussion of \nnon-heterosexual orientations and non-cisgender identities. As such, the GISO Prohibition, as \napplied, targets only LGBTQ+ students in schools on the basis of their gender identity or sexual \norientation, and therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause. \n589.  Moreover, by failing to provide clear boundaries on the speech prohibited under the \nGISO Prohibition, SF 496 invites and has resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.   \n590.  For example, some schools have disallowed GSAs from meeting or declined to \nprovide GSAs resources in schools with students in kindergarten through sixth grade, who are \nexpressly subject to the GISO Prohibition. Others have prohibited GSAs with older students from \nhanging posters or otherwise promoting their meetings in areas of schools where K-6 students may \nbe present.  In addition, some GSA leaders have been told they cannot invite 5th or 6th grade \nstudents to their meetings. \n591.  The GISO Prohibition therefore subjects these students to differential and adverse \ntreatment on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status. \n592.  State Defendants, who are responsible for the adoption and implementation of the \nGISO  Prohibition,  do  not,  and  cannot,  offer  any  legitimate  governmental  purpose  for  the \nprovisionโs differential and adverse treatment of these students on the basis of their sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity, or transgender status. \n593.  SF 496โs GISO Prohibition serves no legitimate governmental purpose, let alone \nan exceedingly persuasive or compelling one. \n146 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 147 of 177\n \n594.  Plaintiff Students are all students in Iowa public school districts subject to the GISO \nProhibition. Plaintiff Students have been discriminated against and subjected to differential and \nadverse treatment on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status \nby the GISO Prohibition.    \n595.  Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational capacity has been injured by the loss of \nrevenue associated with educator participation in online and in-person programming on LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity in the school setting made impermissible by the GISO Prohibition and the consequent \nharm to its mission-critical outreach and impact programs; the additional costs incurred to answer \neducatorsโ questions relating to the scope and effect of the GISO Prohibition on preexisting \nLGBTQ+ inclusivity training and policies; the further costs incurred to prepare, modify, offer, and \nimplement LGBTQ+ inclusivity programming in-school and out-of-school that addresses the \nlimitations on educatorsโ, studentsโ, and GSAsโ activities created by the GISO Prohibition; the \nforced redirection of professional development resources outside of traditional K-12 focus due to \ninability to implement its resources and guidance in the K-12 setting under the GISO Prohibition; \nand the frustration of its organizational purpose of maintaining a GSA network by the restrictions \nand prohibitions imposed upon its member GSAs.  \n596.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools, including students in the kindergarten through sixth-grade setting. Iowa Safe Schoolsโ \nmembers also include GSAs, including GSAs in kindergarten through sixth-grade schools. Iowa \nSafe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of those student members who have \nexperienced and are experiencing discrimination and differential and adverse treatment due to their \nsex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status due to the GISO Prohibition. Iowa \nSafe Schools further asserts in its representational capacity the rights of GSAs in its membership \n147 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 148 of 177\n \nwhose members have experienced and are experiencing discrimination and differential and adverse \ntreatment due to their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status due to the GISO \nProhibition.  \n597.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to be free from discrimination and differential \nand adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender \nstatus.  \n598.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.  \n599.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchools in its organizational and representational capacity would redress the harm caused by State \nDefendants unconstitutional enforcement of the GISO Prohibition.  \n600.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and associational capacities on the \none hand, and State Defendants on the other, concerning the constitutionality, and specifically the \ndiscrimination, of the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools respectfully \nrequest a declaration from this Court that the GISO Prohibition is unconstitutionally discriminatory \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n601.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and \ngender sexuality alliance members have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as \n148 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 149 of 177\n \na direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement \nof the GISO Prohibition. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and gender sexuality \nalliance members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff Students and Iowa \nSafe Schools in its organizational and representational capacity respectfully request injunctive \nrelief that enjoins State Defendants from enforcing the GISO Prohibition. \nCount 3 \nAs Applied to Transgender, as well as Gender Nonconforming or Questioning Students,  \nthe Gender Identity Notification Provision \nViolates Equal Protection Under the Fourteenth Amendment   \n \n602.   This count is brought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools, both for direct \ninjury to itself as an organization and in its representational capacity, on behalf of its GSAs and \nindividual student members, against State Defendants. \n603.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 564 through 567 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n604.  SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision has resulted in the differential and \nadverse treatment of Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools, as an organization and in its \nrepresentational capacity on behalf of its GSAs and Individual Student Members on the basis of \ntheir sex, gender identity, and transgender status, thus violating their Equal Protection rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. \n605.  SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision expressly targets students who \nwish to use gender-affirming names or pronouns that differ from those in school records, by \nrequiring school officials to report any such request to the studentโs parent or guardian.  The \nprovision makes no such requirement for non-LGBTQ+ students whose names and pronouns align \nwith those in their school records. \n606.  The  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision  thus  subjects  these  students  to \ndifferential and adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, gender identity, and transgender status. \n149 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 150 of 177\n \n607.  Alternatively, if SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision is read neutrally, \neven a facially neutral law can violate the Equal Protection Clause where, as here, the law has a \ndiscriminatory purpose and effect. The legislative history and context of SF 496 makes this clear.  \n608.  State Defendants, who are responsible for the adoption and implementation of SF \n496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision, do not, and cannot, offer any legitimate government \nrationale for the provisionโs differential and adverse treatment of students on the basis of their sex, \ngender identity, and transgender status. \n609.  State Defendants cannot, for example, justify the law as promoting parental rights \nin education, as the government cannot enact a law forsaking Constitutional rights for private \nbiases.  Protecting the interests of parents with personal, religious, or philosophical objections to \nLGBTQ+ people cannot be a valid rationale for governmental action which results in the denial of \nequal protection of the laws to students. \n610.  SF 496โs Gender Identity Notification Provision serves no legitimate governmental \npurpose, let alone an exceedingly persuasive or compelling one. \n611.  Plaintiff Students are all students in Iowa public school districts subject to the \nGender Identity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Students have been discriminated against and \nsubjected to differential and adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, gender identity, or \ntransgender status by the Gender Identity Notification Provision.    \n612.  Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational capacity has been injured by the loss of \nrevenue associated with educator participation in online and in-person programming on LGBTQ+ \ninclusivity in the school setting made impermissible by the Gender Identity Notification Provision \nand the consequent harm to its mission-critical outreach and impact programs; the additional costs \nincurred to answer educatorsโ questions relating to the scope and effect of the Gender Identity \n150 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 151 of 177\n \nNotification Provision on preexisting LGBTQ+ inclusivity training and policies; the further costs \nincurred to prepare, modify, offer, and implement LGBTQ+ inclusivity programming in-school \nand out-of-school that addresses the limitations on educatorsโ, studentsโ, and GSAsโ activities \ncreated  by  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision;  the  forced  redirection  of  professional \ndevelopment resources outside of traditional K-12 focus due to inability to implement its resources \nand guidance in the K-12 setting under the Gender Identity Notification Provision; and the \nfrustration of its organizational purpose of maintaining a GSA network by the restrictions and \nprohibitions imposed upon its member GSAs.  \n613.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ members include both individual students in Iowa public \nschools and GSAs. Iowa Safe Schools asserts in its representational capacity the rights of those \nstudent members who have experienced and are experiencing discrimination and differential and \nadverse treatment due to their sex, gender identity, or transgender status due to the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. Iowa Safe Schools further asserts in its representational capacity the rights \nof GSAs in its membership whose members have experienced and are experiencing discrimination \nand differential and adverse treatment due to their sex, gender identity, or transgender status due \nto the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n614.  The interests at stake are germane to Iowa Safe Schoolsโ organizationโs purpose, in \nthat Iowa Safe Schools is an organization dedicated to the protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ \nstudents, including the right of LGBTQ+ students to be free from discrimination and differential \nand adverse treatment on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender \nstatus.  \n615.  Iowa Safe Schoolsโ claim and the relief it requests do not require the participation \nof its individual members.   \n151 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 152 of 177\n \n616.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchools in its organizational and representational capacity would redress the harm caused by State \nDefendants unconstitutional enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n617.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between \nPlaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and associational capacities on the \none hand, and State Defendants on the other, concerning the constitutionality, and specifically the \ndiscrimination, of the Gender Identity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe \nSchools respectfully request a declaration from this Court that the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision is unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n618.  Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational \ncapacity are entitled to injunctive relief. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student and \ngender sexuality alliance members have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as \na direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement \nof the Gender Identity Notification Provision. Plaintiff Students and Iowa Safe Schoolsโ student \nand gender sexuality alliance members have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff \nStudents and Iowa Safe Schools in its organizational and representational capacity respectfully \nrequest  injunctive  relief  that  enjoins  State  Defendants  from  enforcing  the  Gender  Identity \nNotification Provision. \nVI.  VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL ACCESS ACT OF 1984  \n619.  SF 496, as applied, violates the Equal Access Act of 1984, 20 U.S.C. ยง 4071.  \n620.  The Equal Access Act ensures that noncurricular student groups are afforded the \nsame access to public secondary school facilities as other, similarly situated student groups.   \n152 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 153 of 177\n \n621.  The Act applies to any public secondary school that receives federal funds and \ncreates a limited open forum by allowing one or more noncurricular student groups to meet on its \npremises during non-instructional time. Schools meeting these criteria are forbidden to prevent \naccess or deny fair opportunity to students who wish to hold meetings on school grounds. \n622.  Schools allowing at least one noncurricular related student group may not deny \ncomparable access to any other student group because of the religious, political, philosophical, or \nother content of the speech at the groupโs meetings. The Act therefore prohibits schools from \nbanning student-led noncurricular groups because of the content of the speech at the groupsโ \nmeetings. \n623.  โAccessโ and โfair opportunityโ refer not only to physical meeting spaces on school \npremises, but also to recognition and privileges afforded to other groups at the school, including, \nfor example, the right to announce club meetings in the school newspaper, on bulletin boards, or \nover the public-address system. \n624.  The Act does not permit schools to ban a group based on school officialsโ general \nmoral disapproval or on assumptions about the content of speech at group meetings. A school \nviolates the Act by excluding, preventing access, or denying a fair opportunity to a group based on \nthe fact that the group addresses issues of interest to LGBTQ+ students. The Act requires the \nschool to treat each group like other groups and prohibits imposing additional requirements on \nsome student-run groups that are not imposed on all others. \nCount 1  \nAs Applied by the Waterloo Community School District, the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision Violates the Equal Access Act of 1984   \n  \n625.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants JARED \nSMITH, in his official capacity as Waterloo Community School District Superintendent; and \n153 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 154 of 177\n \nJONATHAN COX, JESSE KNIGHT, ASTOR WILLIAMS, LYLE SCHMITT, STACIE MILLS, \nJANELLE EWING, in their official capacities as board members of the Waterloo Community \nSchool District (together โWaterloo Community School Districtโ). \n626.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 619 through 624 as if fully set forth in this count.  \n627.  Waterloo  West  High  School  is  a  public  secondary  school  within  Defendant \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. On information and belief, Waterloo West \nHigh School receives federal financial assistance. Plaintiff P.B.-P. attends Waterloo West High \nSchool. \n628.  Prior to SF 496, Waterloo West High School had and continues to have a limited \nopen public forum hosting at least one student-led, noncurricular club that meets outside of regular \ninstructional hours. A GSA at Waterloo West High School is among those student groups.   \n629.  The Gender Identity Notification Provision has caused the number of members of \nthe Waterloo West High School GSA to dwindle and has caused those who remain members to \ndisengage from GSA activities and leadership and refrain from open group discussion. Students \nnow fear being outed to unsupportive parents or guardians as a result of the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision and increased bullying and harassment from peers as a result of the law as \na whole. \n630.  The  Waterloo  Community  School  District  is  responsible  for  the  application, \nimplementation, and enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n631.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff P.B.-P. and Plaintiff Iowa \nSafe Schools in its representational capacity on behalf of ISS member students in the Waterloo \nCommunity School District would redress the harm caused by Waterloo Community School \n154 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 155 of 177\n \nDistrict application of the Gender Identity Notification Provision and would allow P.B.-P. and ISS \nmembers to enjoy their full rights under the Equal Access Act. \n632.  Plaintiffs P.B.-P. and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between these plaintiffs and \nthe Waterloo Community School District Defendants concerning the application of the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision, including whether it has violated these Plaintiffsโ rights under the \nEqual Access Act. Plaintiff James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity \nrespectfully request a declaration from this Court that Sioux City Community School District \nDefendantsโ application of the Gender Identity Notification Provision violates the Equal Access \nAct.  \n633.  Plaintiff P.B.-P. and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are entitled \nto injunctive relief. These plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury as \na direct and proximate result of the existence and application of the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision. These plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff James Doe \nand Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity respectfully request injunctive relief that \nenjoins Waterloo Community School District Defendants from applying the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision in a manner which violates their rights under the Equal Access Act. \nCount 2  \nAs Applied by Sioux City Community School District, the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision Violates the Equal Access Act of 1984  \n  \n634.  This count is brought by James Doe, by his Parent and Next Friend John Doe, and \nIowa Safe Schools, on behalf of its members in the Sioux City Community School District,  against \nSioux City Community School District Defendants \n635.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 619 through 624 as if fully set forth in this count  \n155 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 156 of 177\n \n636.  JAMES DOEโs high school is a public secondary school within Defendant SIOUX \nCITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. On information and belief, JAMES DOEโs high \nschool receives federal financial assistance. \n637.  Prior to SF 496, JAMES DOEโs high school had and continues to have a limited \nopen public forum hosting at least one student-led, noncurricular club that meets outside of regular \ninstruction. JAMES DOE's high school's GSA was and is one of these student groups. JAMES \nDOEโs high schoolโs GSA provided a sense of community to LGBTQ+ students.  However, \nLGBTQ+ students are now reluctant to join the GSA because they fear being outed to unsupportive \nparents or guardians as a result of the Gender Identity Notification Provision and fear they will \nface negative consequences at home. Further, those who remain members in JAMES DOEโs high \nschoolโs GSA are reluctant to engage in public group activities for fear of harassment and bullying \non the basis of their membership in an openly LGBTQ+ group. \n638.  The Sioux City Community School District is responsible for the application, \nimplementation, and enforcement of the Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \n639.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiff James Doe and Plaintiff \nIowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity on behalf of ISS member students in the Sioux \nCity Community School District would redress the harm caused by Sioux City Community School \nDistrict application of the Gender Identity Notification Provision and would allow James Doe and \nISS members to enjoy their full rights under the Equal Access Act. \n640.  Plaintiffs James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are \nentitled to declaratory relief. There is an actual and substantial controversy between these plaintiffs \nand the Sioux City Community School District Defendants concerning the application of the \nGender Identity Notification Provision, including whether it has violated these Plaintiffsโ rights \n156 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 157 of 177\n \nunder the Equal Access Act. Plaintiff James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational \ncapacity respectfully request a declaration from this Court that Sioux City Community School \nDistrict Defendantsโ application of the Gender Identity Notification Provision violates the Equal \nAccess Act.  \n641.  Plaintiff James Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity are \nentitled to injunctive relief. These plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable \ninjury as a direct and proximate result of the existence and application of the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. These plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. Plaintiff \nJames Doe and Iowa Safe Schools in its representational capacity respectfully request injunctive \nrelief that enjoins Sioux City Community School District Defendants from applying the Gender \nIdentity Notification Provision in a manner which violates their rights under the Equal Access Act. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF  \n \nPlaintiffs respectfully request an order and judgment:   \n \nA.   Declaring  that  the  Library  Restriction,  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation \nProhibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provision are unconstitutional on their face and as \napplied to Plaintiffs due to their overbreadth, vagueness, and infringement upon Plaintiffsโ First \nAmendment rights and are unenforceable.   \nB.  Declaring that SF 496 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Plaintiffs due \nto its discriminatory motivation in violation of Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment rights.  \nC.  Declaring  that  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Prohibition  is \nunconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs due to unjustifiable discrimination on the basis of their sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status in violation of Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights.   \n157 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 121   Filed 10/23/24   Page 158 of 177\n \nD.  Declaring that the Gender Identity Notification Provision is unconstitutional on its \nface and as applied to Plaintiffs due to its unjustifiable discrimination on the basis of their sex, \ngender identity, and transgender status in violation of Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nDeclaring that the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition and Gender Identity Notification \nProvision violate the Equal Access Act.  \nE.  Permanently enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and \nall persons in active concert or participation with them from enforcing the Library Restriction, \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Prohibition, and Gender Identity Notification Provision.  \nF.  Awarding the Plaintiffs reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs; and   \nG.  Awarding any such other relief as the Court deems just.   \nDated: October 18, 2024                           Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/  \nThomas D. Story, AT0013130 (Lead Counsel)  Camilla B.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA  \nCENTRAL DIVISION \n \n \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS f/k/a GLBT YOUTH IN  Case No.   4:23-cv-474   \nIOWA SCHOOLS TASK FORCE, et al.,   \n   \n    Plaintiffs,   RENEWED MOTION FOR \n  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n  v. \n \nKIM REYNOLDS, in her official capacity as \nGovernor of the State of Iowa et al.,  \n \n    Defendants.  \n \n \n  Plaintiffs hereby move for a preliminary injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65 to prevent further irreparable injury pending final adjudication of Plaintiffsโ action. \nThis Motion is submitted upon Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint and is supported by \nthe accompanying Brief in Support of Plaintiffsโ Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction of \nSF 496, the sworn Declarations of Becky Tayler, Executive Director of Plaintiff Iowa Safe Schools \n(โISSโ); Hannah Mitchell, Director of Youth Engagement of Plaintiff ISS; Jordan Mix, Director \nof Educational Programming for Plaintiff ISS; Plaintiff P.B.-P.; Plaintiff A.C., Parent and Next \nFriend Richard Carlson; Parent and Next Friend Ulrike Carlson; Plaintiff T.S.; Plaintiff B.F.S.; \nParent and Next Friend Brigit Stevens; Plaintiff B.F.; Plaintiff James Doe; Plaintiff Daniel \nGutmann; Plaintiff Alyson Telford; non-party Declarant F.J.; non-party Declarant Cindy Harper; \nnon-party Declarant Elesha Gayman Shahinllari and any other material the Court may consider at \nany hearing on this Motion. These Declarations include additional evidence of irreparable harm \nthat has occurred to student members of ISS and chapter GSA members since the law took effect, \nincluding in the months after the Courtโs grant of a partial preliminary injunction as to the other \n1 \n \n\nprovisions of SF 496 on December 29, 2023, and the Eighth Circuit Courtโs opinion reversing this \nCourtโs order, vacating the partial injunction, and remanding the case back to this Court for \nreconsideration of Plaintiffsโ as-applied challenges, and facial challenges in light of Moody v. \nNetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383 (2024). \nAs  Plaintiffs  set  forth  in  their  accompanying  Brief  in  Support  of  Plaintiffsโ \nRenewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims. Senate File 496, 2023 Iowa Acts ch. 91 (โSF 496โ or โthe lawโ), violates the First and \nFourteenth Amendments through its three principle provisions: the โLibrary Restriction,โ โGender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Prohibitionโ (or, โGISO Prohibitionโ),  and  the โGender  Identity \nNotification Provision.โ Plaintiffs move for preliminary injunction on their claims the Library \nRestriction is overbroad, vague, and infringes upon their First Amendment right to receive \ninformation; the GISO Prohibition is overbroad, vague, and infringes upon their First Amendment \nrights to engage in speech, expressive conduct, and expressive association; and the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision is vague and infringes upon their First Amendment right to engage in \nexpressive association. To obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs โneed only establish a \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits of any one of [their] claims.โ Richland/Wilkin Joint Powers \nAuth. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engโrs, 826 F.3d 1030, 1040 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Am. Rivers v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engโrs, 271 F. Supp. 2d 230, 250 (D.D.C. 2003)).  \nAs Plaintiffs establish in the accompanying Brief in Support of Plaintiffsโ Renewed Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable injury \nabsent an injunction. The balance of equities also is in Plaintiffsโ favor, and it is โalways in the \npublic interest to prevent the violation of a partyโs constitutional rights.โ D.M. by Bao Xiong v. \nMinn. State High Sch. League, 917 F.3d 994, 1004 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670 \n2 \n \n\nF.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012)). Plaintiffs request that the Court waive the requirement of bond \nin Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c). Richland/Wilkin, 826 F.3d at 1043 (whether to require \nbond is within courtโs discretion). Public interest litigation is a recognized exception to the bond \nrequirement, especially where, as here, requiring a bond would injure the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs and the relief sought would not pose a hardship to government Defendants.

INTRODUCTION. \nIowa Code ยง 279.80(2) prohibits school districts and educators from โprovid[ing] any \nprogram, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender \nidentity  or  sexual  orientation  to  students  in  kindergarten  through  grade  six.โ  The  Court \npreviously enjoined the law because the terms โgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ were \ndefined so broadly as to make it impossible for a reasonable school district, teacher, or student to \nunderstand what was prohibited. See GLBT Youth in Iowa Schools Task Force v. Reynolds, 709 \nF. Supp. 3d 664 (S.D. Iowa 2023) (โGLBT Youth Iโ). The United States Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit vacated the injunction and remanded the case with instructions to the Court to do \na better job of exploring narrower interpretations of the law that might save it from constitutional \ninfirmity. See GLBT Youth in Iowa Schools Task Force v. Reynolds, 114 F.4th 660 (8th Cir. \n2024) (โGLBT Youth IIโ). \nHaving now done so, the Court concludes there are parts of the law that indeed pass \nconstitutional muster under a narrow, atextual interpretation. Specifically, the Court concludes \nthat the restrictions on any โcurriculum,โ โtest,โ โsurvey,โ โquestionnaire,โ or โinstructionโ may \nbe interpreted narrowly as applying only to (a) mandatory classroom instruction that (b) provides \ndetailed explanations or normative views on gender identity or sexual orientation (as opposed to \nneutral  references  to  those  topics).  As  so  interpreted,  the  restrictions  are  not  facially \nunconstitutional given the broad discretion traditionally afforded to state and local officials to \nchoose topics for mandatory classroom instruction. (These restrictions might be unconstitutional \nas applied in some circumstances, but Plaintiffs have not raised an as-applied challenge.) \nBy contrast, the restrictions on โprogram[s]โ and โpromotionโ relating to gender identity \nand sexual orientation cannot reasonably be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First \nAmendment. The words โprogramโ and โpromotionโ are simply too broad to refer only to \nmandatory classroom curriculum and instead prohibit school districts and educators from, among \nother things, making extracurricular activities relating to gender identity and sexual orientation \navailable to students in grade six or below. These restrictions therefore violate studentsโ First \nAmendment  rights  and  are  facially  unconstitutional.  Accordingly,  the  Court  will  enjoin \nDefendants (state officials and school districts) from taking any steps to enforce the restrictions \non any โprogramโ or โpromotionโ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 4 of 35\nIn the interest of clarity, the Court provides the following guidance as to what this ruling \nmeans: \n(1) School  districts  and  educators  may  not  provide  mandatory  lessons  or \ninstruction to students in grade six or below that include detailed explanations \nor normative views on โgender identityโ or โsexual orientation.โ It does not \nmatter  whether  the  lessons  or  instruction  revolve  around  cisgender  or \ntransgender identities or straight or gay sexual orientations. All are forbidden. \n(2) School districts and teachers nonetheless may provide mandatory lessons or \ninstruction to students in grade six or below that contain neutral references to \ngender  identity  (whether  cisgender  or  transgender)  or  sexual  orientation \n(whether gay or straight). The lessons and instruction simply cannot focus on \nthose topics. Thus, for example, school districts and teachers may assign \nbooks or provide lessons to students in grades six and below that contain \ncharacters  with  gender  identities  (cisgender  or  transgender)  and  sexual \norientations (gay or straight) so long as gender identity and sexual orientation \nare not the focus of the book or lesson. School districts and teachers likewise \nmay make other neutral references to any gender identity and any sexual \norientation during classroom instruction; for example, a teacher may refer to \nhis or her partner even if the partner is same-sex.  \n(3) Students in grades six and below must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality \nAlliances (โGSAsโ) and other student groups relating to gender identity and/or \nsexual orientation.  \n(4) School districts and educators must be permitted to advertise GSAs and other \nstudent groups that relate to gender identity and/or sexual orientation to all \nstudents, including those in grade six and below. This means, among other \nthings, that school districts and educators may: (a) advertise such groups in \nposters or over the loudspeaker to the same degree as any other student group; \n(b) serve as advisors for those groups; (c) encourage students to join those \ngroups;  and  (d)  otherwise  discuss  such  groups  with  students  outside \nmandatory classroom curriculum.    \nThe grounds for the Courtโs ruling are set forth in detail below.  \nPlaintiffs also challenge the constitutionality of a statute that requires school officials to \nnotify parents if a student requests an โaccommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs \ngender identity.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3). In a relatively recent case, the Eighth Circuit struck \ndown as unconstitutional a school policy requiring students and staff to โrespectโ a studentโs \ngender identity because the policy was too vague to provide fair notice to a student or teacher \nabout what was permitted. See Parents Defending Educ. v. Linn Mar Comty. Sch. Dist., 83 F.4th \n658,  669  (8th  Cir.  2023).  Similar  logic  applies  here.  Section  279.78(3)  is,  in  part, \nunconstitutionally vague because it does not define the word โaccommodationโ and therefore \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 5 of 35\ndoes not provide fair notice about when the parental notification requirement applies. There is, \nhowever, one exception: the statute unambiguously requires notice when a student requests an \nโaccommodationโ in the form of asking to be addressed using a โpronoun that is different than \nthe โฆ pronoun assigned to the student in the school districtโs registration forms or records.โ As \nto that exception, the statute is enforceable; otherwise, it is not. Accordingly, state officials and \nschool  districts  may  enforce  the  parental  notice  requirement  if  a  student  asks  for  an \naccommodation in the form of a different pronoun but not as to any other requests for an \naccommodation.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of a statute requiring the removal of all \nbooks from school libraries that contain a โdescriptionโ or โvisual depictionโ of a โsex act.โ In a \nrecent ruling in a different case, the Court concluded that the book restrictions were likely \nfacially  unconstitutional  under  the  First  Amendment.  See  Penguin  Random  House  LLC  v. \nRobbins, No. 4:23-cv-00478-SHL-SBJ, 2025 WL 1156545 (S.D. Iowa Mar. 25, 2025). For \nreasons set forth in that ruling (which will not be repeated here), the Court will continue to enjoin \nstate officials and school districts from enforcing the book restrictions. \nIn sum, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiffsโ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction. \nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND. \nA.  Senate File 496. \nIn late April 2023, the Iowa Legislature passed Senate File 496, which, among other \nthings, enacted new Iowa Code ยง 279.80, entitled โSexual orientation and gender identityโ\nprohibited  instruction.โ  It  states  that  โ[a]  school  district  shall  not  provide  any  program, \ncurriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or \nsexual  orientation  to  students  in  kindergarten  through  grade  six.โ  Iowa  Code  ยง  279.80(2). \nโGender identityโ is defined in section 216.2(12) as โa gender-related identity of a person, \nregardless of the personโs assigned sex at birth.โ โSexual orientationโ is defined in section \n216.2(17) as โactual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.โ This Order \nwill refer to the restrictions in Iowa Code ยง 279.80(2) as the โGender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestrictionโ or, sometimes, simply the โRestriction.โ  \nSenate File 496 also added provisions to the Iowa Code related to parental rights in \neducation. Newly enacted Iowa Code ยง 601.1(2) states that โa parent or guardian bears the \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 6 of 35\nultimate  responsibility,  and  has  the  fundamental,  constitutionally  protected  right,  to  make \ndecisions affecting the parentโs or guardianโs minor child, including decisions related to the \nminor childโs medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and \nextracurricular activities. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.โ \nThere are exceptions for emergency medical care and suspected child abuse. Iowa Code ยง \n601.1(3), (4).  \nNewly enacted Iowa Code ยง 279.78 is entitled โParental rights in education.โ Iowa Code \nยง 279.78(2) prohibits a school district from โknowingly giv[ing] false or misleading information \nto the parent or guardian of a student regarding the studentโs gender identity or intention to \ntransition to a gender that is different than the sex listed on a studentโs official birth certificate \n....โ  Iowa  Code  ยง  279.78(3)  requires  a  โlicensed  practitionerโ  to  inform  a  school  district \nadministrator if a student โrequests an accommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs \ngender identity ... including a request that the licensed practitioner address the student using a \nname or pronoun that is different than the name or pronoun assigned to the student in the school \ndistrictโs registration forms or records.โ In turn, the school district administrator โshall report the \nstudentโs request to the studentโs parent or guardian.โ Id. This Order will refer to this provision \nas the โGender Identity Notification Provision.โ  \nThe phrase โlicensed practitionerโ is defined, in two parts, in Iowa Code ยง 256.145. \nโLicense[d]โ means, in relevant part, โthe authority that is given to allow a person to legally \nserve as a practitioner,โ while โpractitionerโ means โan administrator, teacher, or other licensed \nprofessional, including an individual who holds a statement of professional recognition, who \nprovides educational assistance to students.โ Iowa Code ยง 256.145(4), (7). Thus, the โlicensed \npractitionersโ who must report requests for gender identity accommodations under Iowa Code ยง \n279.78(3)  include,  among  others,  teachers,  librarians,  and  administrators.  Senate  File  496 \nestablishes  graduated  penalties  for  โlicensed  practitionersโ  who  violate  the  disclosure \nrequirements, starting with a โwritten warningโ from the Iowa Department of Education for a \nfirst offense, followed by a disciplinary hearing, โwhich may result in disciplinary action,โ for a \nsecond or subsequent offense. Iowa Code ยง 279.78(4). \nFinally, Senate File 496 amended Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(2) to require each school \ndistrict to establish a โkindergarten through grade twelve library program that is consistent with \nsection 280.6 and with the educational standards established in this section, contains only age-\n6 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 7 of 35\nappropriate  materials,  and  supports  the  student  achievement  goals  of  the  total  school \ncurriculum.โ The phrase โage-appropriateโ is newly defined in section 256.11(19)(a)(1) to mean \nโtopics, messages, and teaching methods suitable to particular ages or age groups of children and \nadolescents, based on developing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacity typical for the \nage or age group. โAge-appropriateโ does not include any material with descriptions or visual \ndepictions of a sex act as defined in section 702.17.โ In turn, Iowa Code ยง 702.17 defines โsex \nactโ to mean: \nany sexual contact between two or more persons by any of the following: \n1.  Penetration of the penis into the vagina or anus. \n2.  Contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus or by \ncontact between the genitalia of one person and the genitalia or \nanus of another person. \n3.  Contact between the finger, hand, or other body part of one person \nand the genitalia or anus of another person, except in the course of \nexamination or treatment by a [licensed professional]. \n4.  Ejaculation onto the person of another. \n5.  By use of artificial sexual organs or substitutes therefor in contact \nwith the genitalia or anus. \n6.  The touching of a personโs own genitals or anus with a finger, \nhand,  or  artificial  sexual  organ  or  other  similar  device  at  the \ndirection of another person. \nSenate File 496, on its face, does not permit school officials to take context into account when \ndetermining whether a book is โage-appropriateโ or contains a โsex act.โ This Order will refer to \nthis provision as the โLibrary Provision.โ  \n  School districts and school employees are subject to graduated penalties for failing to \nremove  non-age-appropriate  materials  from  school  library  programs.  See  Iowa  Code  ยง \n256.11(9)(a). For the first offense, the Iowa Department of Education โshall issue a written \nwarning to the board of directors of the school district or the employee, as applicable.โ Id. ยง \n256.11(9)(a)(3)(a).  For  a  second  or  subsequent  violation,  the  school  district  superintendent \nand/or employee โshall be subject to a hearing conducted by the board of educational examiners \npursuant to [Iowa Code ยง] 256.146, subsection 13, which may result in disciplinary action.โ Id. ยง \n256.11(9)(a)(3)(b)(ii). \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 8 of 35\nB.  Implementation of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction. \nPlaintiffs have offered considerable evidence on how school districts have implemented \nthe  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction.  Many  school  districts  have  prohibited \nstudents in grade six and below from joining GSAs. (ECF1 115-13, ยถ 28 (Nevada); ECF 115-13, \nยถ 30 (Mount Vernon); ECF 115-14, ยถ 18 (Mount Vernon); ECF 115-15, ยถ 8 (Iowa City).) In \nsome schools or school districts, GSAs have been shut down altogether. (ECF 115-7, ยถยถ 25โ26 \n(College Community School District); ECF 115-11, ยถ 32 (Des Moinesโelementary); ECF 115-\n12, ยถ 11 (Norwalk); ECF 115-13, ยถ 24 (Waterloo); ECF 115-13, ยถ 26 (Winterset); ECF 115-15, ยถ \n8 (Iowa Cityโelementary).) In many school districts, GSAs have been prohibited or discouraged \nfrom hanging signs or otherwise engaging in promotion in places where students in grade six and \nbelow might be present. (ECF 115-7, ยถ 24; ECF 115-11, ยถ 30 (Urbandale); ECF 115-12, ยถ 11 \n(Norwalk); ECF 115-13, ยถ 30 (Mount Vernon); ECF 115-14, ยถ 17 (Mount Vernon); ECF 115-15, \nยถ 12 (Iowa City).) For example, the superintendent of the Urbandale School District sent an \nemail โordering the removal of all LGBTQ+ visual representations (pride flags, safe space \nstickers, etc.) from all schools, including high schools, given the potential for a student in grades \nkindergarten through six to see these symbols during a community event.โ (ECF 115-11, ยถ 30.) \nSimilarly, the GSA at Mount Vernon High School was not allowed to hang posters on lockers or \nmake school wide announcements over the loudspeaker because 5th and 6th graders might see or \nhear them. (ECF 115-14, ยถยถ 17, 38.) Other clubs are not subject to the same restrictions. (ECF \n115-7, ยถ 24; ECF 115-14, ยถ 17.) \nIssues have arisen inside the classroom, too. Plaintiff Daniel Gutmann, now a fourth-\ngrade teacher, was instructed not to mention his husband in the presence of students. (ECF 115-\n11, ยถ 12.) In Iowa City, fifth-grade student A.C. worries that writing a report on Chappell Roan, \na queer musician, will lead to discipline. (ECF 115-15, ยถ 14.) A nonbinary student in Eastern \nIowa, A.G., was placed in a difficult position when a teacher instructed students to line up by \ngirls and boys. (ECF 115-6, ยถ 15.) A.G. did not want to join either line, prompting a โbarrage of \nquestions  about  gender  identityโ  from  classmates.  (Id.,  ยถยถ  15โ16.)  Due  to  the  statutory \nrestrictions on โinstructionโ and promotionโ relating to gender identity, the teacher โfelt unable \nto intervene.โ (Id., ยถ 16.)  \n \n1 All references are to the docket number on the Electronic Case Filing system.

Procedural History.  \nPlaintiffs  filed  their  Complaint  and  original  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  on \nNovember 28, 2023. (ECF 1; ECF 2.) The State Defendants2 resisted. (ECF 53.) The School \nDistrict Defendants3 took no position. (ECF 48.) In a ruling dated December 29, 2023, the Court \ngranted in part and denied in part Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. See GLBT Youth \nI, 709 F. Supp. 3d 664. The Courtโs ruling was consolidated and also addressed a partially \noverlapping motion for preliminary injunction in Case No. 4:23-cv-00478. On August 12, 2024, \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the injunction in both cases and \nremanded for further consideration. See GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th 660.  \nFollowing remand, Plaintiffs renew their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (ECF 115.) \nThe School District Defendants again take no position. (ECF 125.) The State Defendants resist. \n(ECF  128.)  On  March  25,  2025,  the  Court  entered  a  ruling  in  Case  No.  4:24-cv-00478 \npreliminarily enjoining enforcement of the Library Provision. See Penguin Random House, No. \n4:23-cv-00478-SHL-SBJ, 2025 WL 1156545. That ruling did not address the enforceability of \nthe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction or Gender Identity Notification Provision \nbecause they were not at issue in that case. \nIII.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARDS. \nโA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.โ Tumey \nv.

The Court must consider four factors: \nโ(1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between this harm \nand the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties litigant; (3) the probability \nthat [the] movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.โ Sleep No. Corp. v. \nYoung, 33 F.4th 1012, 1016 (8th Cir. 2022) (alteration in original) (quoting Dataphase Sys., Inc. \nv.

State High Sch. League, 917 \nF.3d 994, 1000 (8th Cir. 2019). This is a higher standard than applies in other preliminary \ninjunction cases. See id. โWe apply a heightened standard in such instances because the duly \nenacted state statute constitutes government action based on presumptively reasoned democratic \nprocesses, and such action is entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined \nlightly.โ Id. (internal punctuation and citation omitted).   \nWith respect to the remaining three factors, a plaintiff โis not required to prove with \ncertainty the threat of irreparable harm, but it must prove that irreparable injury is likely in the \nabsence of an injunction.โ Sleep No. Corp., 33 F.4th at 1018 (citations omitted). โIrreparable \nharm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be \nfully compensated through an award of damages.โ General Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown's, \nLLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009). โIn balancing the equities, we weigh โthe threat of \nirreparable harmโ shown by the movant against โthe injury that granting the injunction will inflict \non other parties litigant.โโ MPAY Inc. v. Erie Custom Computer Applications, Inc., 970 F.3d \n1010, 1020 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting Dataphase Sys., 640 F.2d at 113). This โrequires a court to \ndistinguish between weak or illusory injuries and very real threats of injuries.โ Rodriguez v. \nMolina, 608 F. Supp. 3d 791, 798 (S.D. Iowa 2022) (cleaned up). It considers harm to both the \nlitigants and other interested parties, like the public. Wachovia Sec., L.L.C. v. Stanton, 571 F. \nSupp. 2d 1014, 1047 (N.D. Iowa 2008). The last factor, the public interest, โinvites the court to \nindulge  in  broad  observations  about  conduct  that  is  generally  recognizable  as  costly  or \ninjurious.โ Id. at 1048. \nWhen  a  party  seeks  preliminary  injunctive  relief  based  on  a  facial  constitutional \nchallenge  under  the  First  Amendment,  district  courts  must  โdetermine  a  lawโs  full  set  of \napplications, evaluate which are constitutional and which are not, and compare the one to the \nother.โ Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 603 U.S. 707, 718 (2024). โThe question is whether โa \nsubstantial number of [the lawโs] applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the \nstatuteโs plainly legitimate sweep.โโ Id. at 723 (quoting Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 615 (2021)). โSo in this singular context, even a law with โa plainly \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 11 of 35\nlegitimate  sweepโ  may  be  struck  down  in  its  entirety.  But  that  is  so  only  if  the  lawโs \nunconstitutional applications substantially outweigh its constitutional ones.โ Id. at 723โ24. Facial \nchallenges are โhard to win.โ Id. at 723. \nIV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS: STANDING. \nA.  Legal Standards.  \nAs  in  any  constitutional  challenge,  a  threshold  question  is  whether  Plaintiffs  have \nstanding. To establish standing, โa plaintiff must present a โcaseโ or โcontroversyโ within the \nmeaning of Article III of the Constitution.โ Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 588 F.3d 585, 591 \n(8th Cir. 2009). โThis โirreducible constitutional minimum of standingโ requires a showing of \nโinjury in factโ to the plaintiff that is โfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,โ \nand โlikely [to] be redressed by a favorable decision.โโ Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560โ61 (1992)). โWhether a plaintiff has shown such an injury โoften \nturns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.โโ Id. (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, \n500, (1975)). โ[T]he question whether he has a cognizable injury sufficient to confer standing is \nclosely bound up with the question of whether and how the law will grant him relief.โ Id. \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Library Provision. \nIn its December 2023 ruling, the Court concluded that at least two categories of Plaintiffs \nhad standing to challenge the Library Provision: (i) โEducator Plaintiffsโ like teachers and school \nlibrarians who face potential discipline for violating Senate File 496; and (ii) โStudent Plaintiffsโ \nwhose access to books was impacted by the law. See generally GLBT Youth I, 709 F. Supp. 3d at \n682โ85. The Eighth Circuit agreed. See GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th at 668 (โPlaintiffs have \nstanding to pursue their First Amendment claim as to the Library Program.โ). On remand, there \nhas been modest turnover among Plaintiffs, but not in a way that materially affects the standing \nanalysis as to the Library Provision. Daniel Gutmann, a fourth-grade teacher (ECF 121, ยถ 15), \nhas been added as a Plaintiff to this case after previously serving as a plaintiff in Case No. 4:23-\ncv-00478. He has standing either way because he is plausibly subject to discipline if he violates \nthe Library Provision. The same is true for Plaintiff Alyson Telford, a seventh-grader teacher \nwhose name was Alyson Browder at the time of the December 2023 ruling. (ECF 121, ยถ 16.) The \nsix Student Plaintiffs also continue to have standing to challenge the Library Provision, which \ndirectly limits the books and materials they can obtain from the school library. These Student \nPlaintiffs range from fifth grade (A.C.) to high school students. (ECF 121, ยถยถ 8โ13.) \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 12 of 35\nC.  At Least Three Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction. \nIn its December 2023 ruling, the Court concluded that three Plaintiffs had standing to \nchallenge the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction, which applies only to students and \nteachers in grades six and below. See GLBT Youth I, 709 F. Supp. 3d at 682. Specifically, \nGutmann had standing because at the time he taught sixth grade; Telford (then Browder) had \nstanding because she made books available to sixth graders; and one Student-Plaintiff, A.C., had \nstanding because the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction plausibly restricted what \nA.C. (then in fourth grade) could do and say within and outside the classroom. See id. at 682, \n687โ88. The Court concluded the remaining Plaintiffs did not have standing because they were \nhigh school students and therefore were not directly impacted by the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction. As the Court explained: \n[N]othing in the law restricts the ability of school districts, teachers, or \nother professionals to provide programs, promotion, and/or instruction of \ngender  identity  and  sexual  orientation  to  students  in  grade  seven  and \nabove. School districts instead have full freedom to offer gay-straight \nalliances (โGSAsโ) or similar clubs that provide resources and support for \nLGBTQ+ students in grades seven and above. Teachers and other licensed \nprofessionals are not restricted in any way from serving as advisors for \nsuch GSAs, displaying rainbow flags, providing instruction on gay and \ntransgender rights, and otherwise performing their responsibilities in a \nmanner that emphasizes inclusiveness and respect for LGBTQ+ students \nin grades seven and above. Likewise, students in grade seven and above \nare free to engage in whatever forms of expression they wish, subject only \nto generally applicable restrictions that apply equally to all students. To \nthe extent school districts, teachers, or students have been interpreting the \nlaw otherwise, they are simply wrong. \nId. at 674; see also Republican Party of Minn., Third Cong. Dist. v. Klobuchar, 381 F.3d 785, \n792โ93 (8th Cir. 2004) (affirming dismissal of First Amendment claim for lack of standing \nwhere the only alleged โchilling effectโ was on speech that was not forbidden by the statute). \n  In GLBT Youth II, the Eighth Circuit agreed that A.C. and the Educator Plaintiffs had \nstanding to challenge the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction. 114 F.4th at 669 & n.1. \nAs to A.C., the Eighth Circuit rejected the State Defendantsโ argument that A.C. was not injured \nby the statute itself, but rather by the school districtโs overly-aggressive reading of it. Id. at 669. \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that it would create a โstanding paradoxโ if a school district \ninterpreted the statute more broadly than it should have but the student could not challenge that \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 13 of 35\ninterpretation. Id. As to the Educator Plaintiffs, the State Defendants conceded standing, and the \nEighth Circuit agreed. Id. at 669 n.1. The Eighth Circuit did not consider the standing of the \nother Student Plaintiffs. Id.    \n  On remand, there have been no material changes relative to standing. Although Gutmann \nnow teaches fourth grade, not sixth, he continues to have standing because he remains subject to \na credible threat of discipline if he violates the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction. \nSee Parents Defending Educ, 83 F.4th at 667 (holding that plaintiffs had standing to challenge \nschool district policy when credible threat of enforcement existed). Telford likewise continues to \nhave standing because she makes books available to sixth-grade students in a way that might be \nconsidered โpromotionโ or โprogramโ related to gender identity or sexual orientation. See id. \nFinally,  A.C.  continues  to  have  standing  because,  as  a  fifth-grade  student,  the  Gender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Restriction arguably restricts what A.C. can do and say within and \noutside the classroom. See GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th at 669; GLBT Youth I, 709 F. Supp. 3d at \n687โ88.  \nGLBT Youth II arguably gives the other Student Plaintiffs a stronger basis for arguing \nstanding given the Eighth Circuitโs recognition that even an arguable misreading of a statute can \ngive rise to standing in some circumstances. See 114 F.4th at 669. To that end, and by way of \nexample, if Student Plaintiffs in grades seven and above are being prevented from joining GSAs \ndue to the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction, it would create the same โstanding \nparadoxโ the Eighth Circuit recognized with respect to A.C. โEven if it is due to a misreading of \nthe statute [the Student Plaintiffsโ] injury is traceable to the Instruction Section, and an injunction \nwould redress that injury.โ Id. The Court need not decide the issue, however, because it can \nalready reach the merits based solely on A.C., Telford, and Gutmann having standing.  \nD.  At Least Two Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Gender Identity Notification \nProvision. \nThe  final  issue  as  it  relates  to  standing  is  whether  any  Plaintiffs  have  standing  to \nchallenge the Gender Identity Notification Provision. In its December 2023 ruling, the Court \nconcluded  that  Plaintiffs  lacked  standing  because  the  Provision  allegedly  discouraged \ntransgender students from coming out to their teachers or classmates (lest their gender identity be \ndisclosed to their parents), but all Student Plaintiffs were already โoutโ to their families. In other \nwords, no Plaintiff could establish a concrete injury. On remand, there are two new Plaintiff-\nEducators, Gutmann and Telford, who argue standing from a different angle: they are subject to \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 14 of 35\ndiscipline  if  they  do  not  inform  school  administrators  when  a  student  โrequests  an \naccommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs gender identity.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3). \nIn  addition,  Plaintiff  Iowa  Safe  Schools  (โISSโ)  alleges  that  it  has  organizational  and \nassociational standing. See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009) (recognizing \nthat organizations โcan assert the standing of their membersโ); Mo. Coal. for Envโt v. FERC, 544 \nF.3d  955,  957  (8th  Cir.  2008)  (recognizing  that  organizations  have  standing  in  some \ncircumstances when โthe interests at stake [are] germane to the organizationโs purposeโ). \nThe Court agrees that Gutmann and Telford have standing by virtue of their status as \neducators who face a credible risk of discipline if they fail to comply with the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision. See Parents Defending Educ. 83 F.4th at 666. The Court concludes that \nISS does not have associational standing because it still has not identified a member who has a \ncredible risk of injury if the Gender Identity Notification Provision is enforced. See Religious \nSisters of Mercy v. Becerra, 55 F.4th 583, 601 (8th Cir. 2022) (holding that an organization must \nidentify particular members and their injuries in order to establish associational standing). ISSโs \narguments for organizational standing are likewise insufficient; at most, ISS has alleged that the \nGender Identity Notification Provision (i) is inconsistent with ISSโs core mission of providing \nsupport for LGBTQ+ students and has required the entity to divert time and resources away from \nother projects, and (ii) has discouraged student participation in GSAs or caused schools to drop \nGSAs altogether. The first is not enough in and of itself to satisfy Article III. See Food & Drug \nAdmin.  v.  All.  for  Hippcratic  Med.,  602  U.S.  367,  394  (2024).  The  second  is based  on  a \nmisreading of the Gender Identity Notification Provision, which does not even arguably prevent \nschools from having GSAs or students from joining them. See Klobuchar, 381 F.3d at 792โ93.   \nV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS: CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LIBRARY PROVISION. \nIn a recent ruling in Case No. 4:23-cv-00478, the Court enjoined enforcement of the \nLibrary Provision, concluding it was likely facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment. \nSee Penguin Random House, No. 4:23-cv-00478-SHL-SBJ, 2025 WL 1156545. For the reasons \nset forth in that ruling (which will not be repeated here), the Court will grant Plaintiffsโ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction as it relates to the Library Provision. The Court recognizes that the \nState Defendants have appealed the ruling, and the Court of course will abide by the Eighth \nCircuitโs disposition of that appeal.  \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 15 of 35\nVI.  LEGAL  ANALYSIS:  CONSTITUTIONALITY  OF  THE  GENDER  IDENTITY/ \nSEXUAL ORIENTATION RESTRICTION. \nA.  Introduction. \nIn its December 2023 ruling, the Court enjoined the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestriction because it concluded the law was โstaggeringly broadโ on its face and therefore \nalmost certainly would be enforced in an arbitrary way. The Court explained:  \nOn its face, the law prohibits school districts and teachers from providing \nany  โprogram,  curriculum,  test,  survey,  questionnaire,  promotion,  or \ninstruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to any students \nin kindergarten through grade six.โ Based on the neutral definitions of \nโgender  identityโ  and  โsexual  orientation,โ  Senate  File  496 \nunambiguously  prohibits  instruction  relating  to  any  gender  identity \n(cisgender or transgender) and any sexual orientation (gay or straight). See \nIowa Code ยง 216.2(10) (defining โgender identityโ as โa gender-related \nidentity of a person, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at birthโ); \nIowa  Code  ยง  216.2(16)  (โdefining  โsexual  orientationโ  as  โactual  or \nperceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexualityโ). It follows that \nany teacher in grade six or below who incorporates gender identity or \nsexual orientation into the curriculum in any way has violated section \n279.80.  This  would  include,  for  example,  teachers  or  other  licensed \nprofessionals like the Educator Plaintiffs who make books available to \nstudents that refer to any characterโs gender or sexual orientation; which is \nto say, virtually every book ever written. Similarly, a math teacher will \nhave violated the law by requiring students to take an exam stating that \nSally bought eight apples and ate three and asking how many โsheโ has \nleft. This is a forbidden โtest . . . relating to gender identity.โ Any number \nof other examples also could be given. \nGLBT Youth I, 709 F. Supp. 3d at 703. The Eighth Circuit reversed, concluding the Court \nโimparted its interpretation without referencing several canons of construction that may have \nrevealed a narrower, reasonable interpretation, such as the canons of constitutional-avoidance, \nnoscitus a sociis, and Iowaโs admonition to interpret its laws reasonably and in a manner feasible \nof execution, Iowa Code ยง 4.4(3)-(4).โ GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th at 670โ71.  \n  The Eighth Circuitโs criticism is well-taken, and the Court will try to do a better job this \ntime around of exploring alternative interpretations of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestriction that may narrow its scope and/or protect it from constitutional infirmity. For reasons \nexplained below, the Court concludes that there are indeed alternative interpretations that make \ncertain aspects of the Restriction constitutional, including, in particular, the portion of the law \nthat prohibits schools from providing any โcurriculum, test, survey, questionnaire . . . or \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 16 of 35\ninstruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ to students in grade six and below. \nThe  State  Defendants  have  convinced  the  Court  that  these  portions  of  the  law  should  be \ninterpreted as applying only to compulsory classroom instruction and not to extracurricular \nactivities like GSAs or informal counseling or guidance provided by teachers to students.   \nConverselyโand, again, for reasons explained in full belowโthe Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment  insofar as it \nprohibits schools from providing any โprogram . . . [or] promotion . . . relating to gender \nidentity or sexual orientationโ to students in grade six or below. The words โprogramโ and \nโpromotionโ  are  too  broad  to  be  interpreted  as  applying  solely  to  compulsory  classroom \ninstruction even after relevant canons of construction are explored and exhausted. It follows that \nthe restrictions on โprogramsโ and โpromotionโ related to gender identity and sexual orientation \nprohibit things like GSAs, informal guidance/support, and other activities outside the mandatory \ncurriculum. Because the First Amendment does not permit such restrictions, the unconstitutional \napplications of these parts of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction substantially \noutweigh  the  constitutional  applications.  The  restrictions  on  โprogramsโ  and  โpromotionโ \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation therefore will be enjoined.   \nB.  Interpreting the Instruction Provision. \nThe first step is to determine the proper interpretation of the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation  Restriction,  which  states:  โA  school  district  shall  not  provide  any  program, \ncurriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or \nsexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.80(2). There \nare two parts to the interpretive analysis: (1) what the words โprogram, curriculum, test, survey, \nquestionnaire, promotion, or instructionโ mean; and (2) what the words โrelating to gender \nidentity or sexual orientationโ mean. The first part ignores the substance of the restriction and \nsimply asks when it applies (as in, which activities are restricted), while the second focuses \nentirely on substance (as in, what topics or subjects are off-limits).  \n1.  The  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction  Imposes  Restrictions  on \nCompulsory and Non-Compulsory Parts of the School Curriculum.   \nAs  to  the  first  part  of  the  analysis,  the  State  Defendants  argue  that  the  Gender \nIdentity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction  applies  โonly  to  a  schoolโs  compulsory  instructional \nprogram, not to every activity a school may offer students.โ (ECF 128, p. 9.) Plaintiffs, by \ncontrast, argue the statute is too broad to be limited to โcompulsory instructionโ and instead \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 17 of 35\napplies to in-class and extracurricular activities alike, including GSAs. Both sides support their \npositions with reference to canons of construction.  \nThe  starting  point  is,  of  course, the  statutory  language,  which  uses  seven  words  to \ndescribe  which  activities  are  restricted:  โprogram,  curriculum,  test,  survey,  questionnaire, \npromotion, or instruction.โ Two of those words, โtestโ and โinstruction,โ unmistakably refer to \nin-class activities that one typically would regard as a compulsory part of an educational system. \nThe word โcurriculumโ is slightly broader in the sense that it can sometimes refer to out-of-class \nactivities. See, e.g., Henerey ex rel. Henerey v. City of St. Charles, Sch. Dist., 200 F.3d 1128, \n1133 (8th Cir. 1999) (characterizing student-body election as โpart of the schoolโs curriculumโ). \nEven so, โcurriculumโ is typically understood as referring to mandatory parts of education, too, \nin contrast to extra-curricular activities like clubs or sports teams, which are voluntary. \nOf the remaining four words, โsurveyโ and โquestionnaireโ do not inherently refer to \nmandatory or compulsory parts of the education system. Indeed, those words do not carry any \nplain or obvious meaning as it relates to education, period. Devoid of context, one might wonder \nwhy they ended up in the statute at all. In context, however, the answer is clear. The State \nDefendants have shown that the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction ended up in \nSenate  File  496  in  response  to  parent  complaints  about  schools  administering  surveys  or \nquestionnaires to students that included questions about gender identity and sexual orientation. \n(E.g.,  ECF  53-1,  p.  2.)  With  this  context  in  mind,  although  the  words  โsurveyโ  and \nโquestionnaireโ do not mean โcompulsoryโ in ordinary usage, they reasonably can be interpreted \nin the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction as referring to compulsory parts of the \ncurriculum. The word โsurvey,โ in particular, appears more than a dozen times in Iowa Code \nChapter  279,  virtually  always  as  part  of  laws  restricting  when  school  districts  can  require \nstudents to provide information. See Iowa Code ยง 279.76(1) (imposing limits on surveys relating \nto a studentโs mental, emotional, or physical health without parental consent); Iowa Code ยง \n279.79(1) (imposing limits on surveys that may yield information about, inter alia, a studentโs or \nparentโs political affiliation, mental health, sexual orientation, or religion). It is not unreasonable \nto interpret it the same way in the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction. \nThe word โprogramโ is different. A โprogramโ is not inherently compulsory. See, e.g., \nPenn. Depโt of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 211 (1998) (recognizing that programs may be \neither voluntary or mandatory); Loras Coll. v. Iowa C.R. Commโn, 285 N.W.2d 143, 144 (Iowa \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 18 of 35\n1979) (similar). Nor do the education-related chapters of the Iowa Code use the word โprogramโ \nexclusively or primarily to describe compulsory activities; to the contrary, it is frequently used to \ndescribe things that are non-mandatory. See, e.g., Iowa Code ยง 279.46 (authorizing, but not \nrequiring, early retirement programs); Iowa Code ยง 279.49(1) (authorizing, but not requiring, \nchildcare programs); Iowa Code ยง 279.68(2)(a) (authorizing, but not requiring, summer reading \nprograms); Iowa Code ยง 280.28(4) (encouraging, but not requiring, anti-bullying programs). \nIndeed, the State Defendants themselves recognize that โprogramโ can describe voluntary and \nmandatory activities alike, including, as to the former, extracurricular activities like intramural \nsports. (ECF 128, p. 12 (explaining that Iowa law distinguishes between a schoolโs โeducational \nprogram,โ โlibrary program,โ โactivity program,โ and โinstructional programโ).) When the Iowa \nLegislature does intend for the word โprogramโ to refer to compulsory activities, it says so \nexpressly. See Iowa Code ยง 280.3(1) (โThe board of directors of each public school district and \nthe authorities in charge of each nonpublic school shall prescribe the minimum educational \nprogramโฆ.โ) (emphasis added); Iowa Code ยง 280.3(5) (โPublic school kindergarten programs \nshall and public and nonpublic school prekindergarten programs may be provided.โ) (emphasis \nadded); Iowa Code ยง 280.19A(1) (โEach school district shall adopt a plan to provide alternative \noptions education programs to students who either at risk of dropping out or have dropped out.โ) \n(emphasis  added).  This  makes  it  difficult  to  interpret  the  word  โprogramโ  in  the  Gender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Restriction as referring only to compulsory curriculum.  \nThe same is true for the word โpromotion.โ It has two common meanings, neither of \nwhich inherently has anything to do with an activity being โcompulsoryโ or โvoluntary.โ See \nPromotion, MERRIAM-WEBSTERโS COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2020) (โ1: the act or fact \nof being raised in position or rank; 2: the act of furthering the growth or development of \nsomething.โ). The Iowa Code sheds no further light. The words โpromoteโ and โpromotionโ \nappear in Iowa Code Chapter 279 a handful of times, most of which refer to elevating someone \nto  a  higher  position.  See  Iowa  Code  ยงยง  279.14B,  279.21(2)(b)  (discussing  employee \npromotions).  This  is  obviously  not  what  the  word  means  in  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction. In the other instances where they appear in Iowa Code Chapter 279, \nโpromoteโ and โpromotionโ are used as synonyms for โencourage.โ See Iowa Code ยง 279.66(1) \n(requiring the adoption of policies โthat are designed to promote responsible behavior on school \nproperty and at school functionsโ); Iowa Code ยง 279.68(1)(b)(3) (directing school districts to \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 19 of 35\ndevelop reading proficiency initiatives โincluding but not limited to the promotion of parent-\nguided home readingโ). This tracks one of the common meanings of โpromotionโ and is surely \nwhat the Iowa Legislature had in mind in the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction; i.e., \nthe Legislature wanted to forbid school districts from encouraging students to explore concepts \nof gender identity or sexual orientation. \nInterpreting โpromotionโ to mean โencourageโ makes it difficult, however, to conclude \nthe Restriction only prohibits โpromotionโ as part of the mandatory school curriculum. Schools \nโencourageโ or โpromoteโ things all the time that have nothing to do with mandatory school \ncurriculum, including, for example, community service, at-home reading, and extracurricular \nclubs and sports teams. It follows that the only reasonable interpretation of the word โpromotionโ \nin the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction is that it prohibits anything a school district \nor teacher might do in any context to encourage students in grade six and below to explore issues \nregarding gender identity and sexual orientation. Take, for example, a teacher who learns during \nclassroom discussion that a student is gay. If the teacher approaches the student after class \nendsโi.e., after the โmandatory curriculumโ is overโand encourages the student to join a GSA, \nthis would constitute โpromotion . . . relating to . . . sexual orientationโ under the ordinary \nmeaning of those terms. In fact, the district itself has engaged in โpromotion . . . relating to . . . \nsexual orientationโ merely by offering the GSA to students in grade six and below in the first \nplace. It is no wonder that schools have interpreted the law as prohibiting students in those \ngrades from joining GSAs or even being exposed to promotional materials for such groups.  \nThis interpretation of โpromotionโ and โprogramโ is reinforced by the fact that the \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction uses the words โshall not provideโ to explain \nwhat school districts cannot do; as in, they โshall not provide any program โฆ [or] promotion โฆ \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.โ \nMerriam-Webster  defines  โprovideโ  to  mean  โto  supply  or  make  availableโ  or  โto  make \nsomething available to.โ See Provide, MERRIAM-WEBSTERโS COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th ed. \n2020). Under plain meaning, a school district is โprovid[ing]โ a โprogram โฆ [or] promotion \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ when it makes GSAs and other resources \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation available for students in grade six or below.   \nThis plain meaning interpretation creates major problems under the First Amendment, \nwhich limits when schools can prohibit students from joining student organizations or otherwise \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 20 of 35\nexpressing themselves. See, e.g., Gay & Lesbian Students Assโn v. Gohn, 850 F.2d 361, 367โ68 \n(8th Cir. 1988). These problems presumably explain why the State Defendants want the Court to \ninterpret the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction as applying only to compulsory \ncurriculum. Under the canon of constitutional avoidance, the Court agrees that it must search for \na reasonable alternative interpretation that would avoid constitutional problems. See GLBT Youth \nII, 114 F.4th at 671 (directing the court to โdiscuss[] and exhaust[]โ other interpretive methods); \nState v. Iowa Dist. Ct. ex rel. Story Cnty., 843 N.W.2d 76, 85 (Iowa 2014) (โThe doctrine of \nconstitutional avoidance suggests the proper course in the construction of a statute may be to \nsteer clear of โconstitutionals shoalsโ when possible.โ)  \nThis leads to another important canon, noscitur a sociis, which directs courts to โread \nwords in context rather than in isolation ... This canon โsummarizes the rule of both language and \nlaw that the meanings of particular words may be indicated or controlled by associated words.โโ \nState v. Ross, 941 N.W.2d 341, 348 (Iowa 2020) (quoting Peak v. Adams, 799 N.W.2d 535, 547 \n(Iowa 2011) (quoting 11 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts ยง 32:6 at 432 (4th ed. 1999)). \nThe State Defendants argue that this canon supports their interpretation of โpromotionโ and \nโprogramโ as being forbidden only when part of the mandatory curriculum because other words \nin the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction describe mandatory parts of the curriculum.  \nThe Court cannot agree. Of the seven relevant words in the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation  Restriction,  only  threeโcurriculum,  test,  and  instructionโinherently  relate  to \nmandatory parts of the educational curriculum. Two othersโsurvey and questionnaireโdo not \ninherently relate to compulsory curriculum and instead, at most, take on that meaning only when \nsupplemented with contextual clues from elsewhere in the education-related provisions of the \nIowa Code. The final two wordsโprogram and promotionโcarry no inherent connotation of \nbeing compulsory or mandatory whatsoever, nor are they primarily used elsewhere in the Iowa \nCode in such a manner. Thus, in total, only three of the seven relevant words in the Restrictionโ\ni.e., less than halfโcarry the meaning the State Defendants wish to ascribe to all seven. It \nfollows that this is not a situation where โwords of a feather flock together,โ Ross, 941 N.W.2d at \n348, but rather one in which the Iowa Legislature chose to use disparate terms with distinct \nmeanings.  The  Court  must  give  effect  to  this  choice.  See  Graham  Cnty.  Soil  &  Water \nConservation Dist. v. U.S. ex rel. Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 288 (2010) (refusing to apply noscitus a \nsociis because โ[t]he substantive connection, or fit, between the terms [in the statute] is not so \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 21 of 35\ntight or so self-evident as to demand that we โrobโ any of them โof its independent and ordinary \nsignificanceโโ (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 338โ39 (1979))). Meaning: \nnoscitur a sociis does not support the State Defendantsโ position that the words โpromotionโ and \nโprogramโ refer to compulsory curriculum. See id.  \nThe State Defendants also urge the Court to apply the title-and-headings canon, noting \nthat the title of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction is โSexual orientation and \ngender identityโprohibited instruction.โ (ECF 128, p. 6.) Because the word โinstructionโ is \ngenerally associated with compulsory curriculum, the State Defendants argue the inclusion of \nthat word in the title makes it appropriate to interpret the entire statute as referring to compulsory \ncurriculum. See Des Moines Flying Serv., Inc. v. Aerial Servs. Inc., 880 N.W.2d 212, 220โ21 \n(Iowa 2016). The problem remains, however, the Legislatureโs decision to use disparate words \nlike โsurvey,โ โquestionnaire,โ โprogram,โ and โpromotionโ in the statutory text. The first two of \nthose words can be interpreted as referring to mandatory portions of the curriculum only with \nsome level of extra-textual effort; the last two cannot be interpreted that way at all. Accordingly, \nthe  Court  cannot  accept  the  State  Defendantsโ  argument,  but  rather  must  follow  the  Iowa \nSupreme Courtโs admonition that โthe title โcannot limit the plain meaning of the text.โโ State v. \nShorter, 945 N.W.2d 1, 8 (Iowa 2020) (quoting Des Moines Flying Serv., 880 N.W.2d at 221). \nTo that end, the title-and-headings canon must be used โalong with our other statutory \ninterpretation  rules,โ  Des  Moines  Flying  Serv.,  880  N.W.2d.  at  221,  such  as  the  rule  that \nโlegislative intent is expressed through selective placement of statutory terms,โ State v. Macke, \n933  N.W.2d  226,  235  (Iowa  2019).  Here,  the  Iowa  Legislature  clearly  understands  that \nโprogramsโ can be either compulsory or non-compulsory and specifies when it wants the use the \nword in one way or the other. Compare, e.g. Iowa Code ยง 279.68(2)(a) (using permissive \nlanguage  for  summer  reading  programs),  with  Iowa  Code  ยง  280.19A(1)  (using  mandatory \nlanguage for alternative education programs). The Legislatureโs failure to so specify in the \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction means it must have intended the word โprogramโ \nto include mandatory and voluntary programs alike. The same is true for โpromotion.โ  \nThe Eighth Circuit addressed a similar issue in Parents Defending Education v. Linn Mar \nCommunity  School  District,  83  F.4th  at  668โ69.  There,  a  school  district  enacted  a  policy \nrequiring students to โrespect a studentโs gender identityโ as part of a section entitled โNames \nand Pronouns.โ Id. at 668. Based on the section title, the district court interpreted the policy \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 22 of 35\nnarrowly as simply requiring students to use other studentsโ preferred names and pronouns. Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit disagreed, concluding the section title could not take precedence over the \nโplain meaningโ of the policy language itself. Id. at 669. The same logic applies here.  \nIn  sum,  the  Court  agrees  with  the  State  Defendants  that  five  words  in  the  Gender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Restrictionโcurriculum, test, instruction, survey, and questionnaire \nโreasonably can be interpreted as referring to mandatory portions of the educational curriculum. \nThe remaining two words in the Restrictionโprogram and promotionโcannot reasonably be \ninterpreted in that manner even after exhausting all relevant canons of construction. \n2.  The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction Limits Activities that Revolve \nAround or Focus on Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation. \nThe next question is what the words โrelating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ \nmean.  In  other  words,  the  Court  must  figure  out  what  topics  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction prohibits from being part of any โprogram, curriculum, test, survey, \nquestionnaire, promotion, or instructionโฆ.โ \nThe analysis starts, again, with the statutory text, which defines โgender identityโ to mean \nโa gender-related identity of a person, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at birthโ and \nโsexual  orientationโ  to  mean  โactual  or  perceived  heterosexuality,  homosexuality,  or \nbisexuality.โ The Court continues to believe the breadth of these definitions, when combined \nwith their facial neutrality and the words โrelating to,โ means the most natural reading of the \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction is that it prohibits programs, promotion, and \ninstruction relating in any way to any gender identity (cisgender or transgender) or any sexual \norientation (gay or straight). See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 383 (1992) \n(Scalia, J.) (โThe ordinary meaning of [โrelating toโ] is a broad one.โ). In its December 2023 \nruling, however, the Court erred by not considering reasonable alternative interpretations that \nmight narrow the lawโs scope. See GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th at 670โ71. \nPlaintiffs offer a narrower interpretation of the law, arguing that it focuses exclusivelyโ\nand  unconstitutionallyโon  LGBTQ+  students.  Specifically,  according  to  Plaintiffs,  the  law \nprohibits  teachers  and  students  from  reading  LGBTQ+  themed  books,  responding  to  anti-\nLGBTQ+ bullying, displaying pride or safe space signs, permitting GSAs, and self-expressing \ntheir LGBTQ+ identities. In short, Plaintiffs argue that the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestriction โremove[s] the concept of LGBTQ+ people from the school entirelyโto erase their \nvery existence.โ (ECF 115-1, p. 21.) Plaintiffs do not, however, attempt to square their position \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 23 of 35\nwith the neutral definitions of โgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ in the Restriction itself, \ninstead relying largely on stray post-enactment comments by legislators and evidence of how \nindividual school districts have responded to the law. This is problematic. See United States v. \nMonsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 610 (1989) (explaining that post-enactment statements by legislators \nโโform a hazardous basis for inferring the intentโ behind a statuteโ (quoting United States v. \nPrice, 361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960)).  \nFor their part, the State Defendantsโ brief devotes little attention to the words โrelating to \ngender identity or sexual orientation mean,โ instead focusing almost entirely on their argument \nthat those words, however interpreted, apply only to compulsory curriculum. To the extent the \nState Defendants analyze the words โrelating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ at all, it is \nto argue anecdotally that they do not: prevent students from referring to teachers with gender-\nspecific titles like โMr.โ or โMs.โ (ECF 128, p. 14); prohibit the use of pronouns (id.); apply to \nextracurricular activities like GSAs or basketball teams (id., p. 16); apply to school libraries (id., \npp 16โ17); or prohibit books with gay or transgender characters (id.). At oral argument, the State \nDefendantsโ counsel was more helpful, asserting that a school district or teacher is permitted to \nassign books or other materials to students in grade six and below that contain a โneutral \nreferenceโ to gender identity (cisgender or transgender) or sexual orientation (gay or straight) but \nnot if the โpurpose of assigning the book is to explain to students, hey, this is what a same-sex \ncouple is, this is what sexuality isโ or to offer โsome type of normative view on marriage.โ (ECF \n139, pp. 78โ79.) In other words, according to the State Defendants, school districts and teachers \ncannot explain or offer normative views on concepts like marriage, sexual orientation, or gender \nidentity to students in grade six and below but are not precluded from providing content to \nstudents that includes incidental or neutral references to those topics.  \nThe  State  Defendantsโ  interpretation  is  attractive  because  it  solves  the  โabsurdityโ \nproblem that arises when the words of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction are \ngiven their plain meaning. It is, however, an atextual interpretation in at least two ways. First, it \ninterprets the words โrelating toโ narrowly to mean, in essence, โfocusing onโ or โrevolving \naround.โ Contra, e.g., Pugin v. Garland, 599 U.S. 600, 607 (2023) (describing โrelating toโ as a \nโbroad phraseโ). Second, it superimposes a distinction between โneutralโ references to gender \nidentity and sexual orientation (which are permitted) and normative or explanatory references to \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 24 of 35\nthose concepts (which are not) despite the absence of any such distinction in the plain text of the \nstatute.  \nAs to the first argument, the Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit have recognized that \nalthough the words โrelating toโ are โbroadโ and โindeterminate,โ they may be given a narrower \nreading when context so requires. See Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.S. 798, 811โ12 (2015); Barcomb \nv. Gen. Motors LLC, 978 F.3d 545, 550 (8th Cir. 2020). The Supreme Court has done so in the \ncontext of preemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (โERISAโ). \nSee New York State Conf. of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, \n655โ56 (1995) (โIf โrelate toโ were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, \nthen for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its court, for โ[r]eally, universally, \nrelations stop nowhere.โโ Id. at 655 (quoting H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed., \nWorldโs Classics 1980)). There, the Supreme Court decided to โgo beyond the unhelpful text and \nthe frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA \nstatute as a guideโ to understanding what Congress intended. Id. at 656. Applied here, this logic \narguably gives the Court the freedom to interpret the words โrelating toโ to mean โfocusing onโ \nor โrevolving aroundโ even though this is not the common interpretation of those words.  \nThis logic appears to be used fleetingly, and the Court is reluctant to employ it. See, e.g., \nLamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U.S. 709, 717 (2018) (โ[W]hen asked to interpret \nstatutory language including the phrase โrelating to,โ โฆ this Court has typically read the relevant \ntext expansively.โ). Nonetheless, the Court must endeavor to read the statute โreasonably and in \na manner feasible of execution, Iowa Code ยง 4.4(3)-(4).โ GLBT Youth II, 114 F.4th at 670โ71. \nAccordingly, the Court will interpret โrelating toโ narrowly and atextually to mean โfocusing onโ \nor โrevolving around.โ  \nSimilarly, under the constitutional-avoidance canon and similar principles, the Court will \naccept the State Defendantsโ argument that the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction \npermits โneutralโ references to gender identity and sexual orientation. Although atextual, this \ninterpretation avoids the absurdity that arises if the Restriction is literally interpreted to forbid \nany reference to gender identity or sexual orientation. See Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Iowa Depโt of \nRevenue, 789 N.W.2d 417, 427 n.8 (Iowa 2010) (โ[W]hen a literal interpretation of a statute \nresults in absurd consequences that undermine the clear purpose of the statute, an ambiguity \narises.โ). The Court therefore will interpret the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction as \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 25 of 35\nmaking a distinction between normative or explanatory references to gender identity and sexual \norientation (not permitted) and neutral references to those concepts (permitted). In other words, \nschool  districts  and  teachers  cannot  provide  detailed  explanations  or  normative  views  on \nconcepts like marriage, sexual orientation, or gender identity to students in grade six and below \nbut  are  permitted  to  provide  content  to  those  students  that  includes  incidental  or  neutral \nreferences to those topics.  \nA few examples will help illustrate the difference. Suppose a book contains straight or \ngay characters but does not attempt to explain or offer normative views on same- or opposite-sex \nmarriage. Such a book would not โfocus onโ or โrevolve aroundโ sexual orientation and thus \nwould be permitted under the State Defendantsโ interpretation of the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction. The same is true for a math problem that has a cisgender or transgender \nperson  as  the  subject  or  teachers  who  refer  to  their  spouses  during  classroom  discussion, \nregardless of whether the spouse is the same or opposite sex. All these things are permitted. The \nteachers simply cannot go further in explaining concepts of sexual orientation or gender identity.  \nThere are, to be sure, practical problems with this interpretation. As any parent or teacher \nknows, kids ask questions. So, for example, if a book includes a reference to a same-sex couple, \na third grader with opposite-sex parents might ask why. The next section will address how this \nimpacts the constitutionality of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction.  \nC.  Some  Parts  of  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction  Are  Facially \nUnconstitutional But Others Are Not. \nHaving now interpreted both parts of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction, \nthe  question  turns  to  whether  the  Restriction  is  constitutional  in  all,  some,  or  none  of  its \napplications. The answer varies depending on which part of the Restriction is being considered.  \n1.  The  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction  Is  Not  Facially \nUnconstitutional in Prohibiting School Districts from Providing Any Curriculum, \nTest,  Instruction,  Survey,  or  Questionnaire  on  Gender  Identity  and  Sexual \nOrientation as Part of Compulsory Curriculum. \nThe Court first concludes that the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction is not \nfacially  unconstitutional  insofar  as  it  prohibits  school  districts  from  providing  compulsory \ninstruction that explains or provides normative views on gender identity and sexual orientation to \nstudents in grade six or below. State and local officials have โtraditional latitude to determine \nappropriate subjects of instruction.โ Bd. of Educ. of Westside Comty. Sch. v. Mergens By & \nThrough Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 241 (1990). More specifically, school officials โare entitled to \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 26 of 35\nexercise greater control [over curriculum content] to assure that participants learn whatever the \nactivity is designed to teach [and] that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may \nbe inappropriate for their level of maturityโฆ.โ Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, \n271 (1988). Here, reasonable minds may disagree about whether elementary school students are \ntoo young to study sexual orientation and gender identity as part of mandatory curriculum, but it \nis the job of state and local officials, not federal courts, to resolve that disagreement. See id. at \n273 (โ[T]he education of the Nationโs youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, \nand state and local school officials, and not of federal judges.โ).  \nGranted, Plaintiffs have raised credible arguments about whether the enactment of the \nGender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction was motivated by discriminatory animus. The \nreality, however, is that the law neutrally forbids instruction on any sexual orientation (gay, \nstraight, or otherwise) or gender identity (cisgender or transgender). As long as this facially \nneutral  law  applies  only  to  any  mandatory  โcurriculum,  test,  instruction,  survey,  or \nquestionnaireโ and does not forbid โneutralโ references to gender identity or sexual orientation, it \nis not unconstitutional on its face. \nThere are, to be sure, scenarios where the law might be unconstitutional as applied. For \nexample, if, notwithstanding the neutral language of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestriction,  the  State  allows  one  teacher  to  explain  heterosexual  marriage  as  part  of  the \nclassroom curriculum but punishes another for explaining gay marriage, it would create First \nAmendment  problems.  See,  e.g.,  Gerlich  v.  Leath,  861  F.3d  697,  705  (8th  Cir.  2017) \n(recognizing that the First Amendment generally prohibits viewpoint discrimination). The law \nmust be applied just as neutrally as it is written.  \nThe State also will need to be careful in howโif at allโit tries to enforce the law when a \nteacher responds to a student question. Suppose, for example, a teacher assigns a book that \ncontains a neutral reference to a transgender character or same-sex couple (either of which the \nState Defendants admit is permissible). If a student asks what it means to be transgender or why \ntwo men (or women) can be married to each other, state officials must give latitude to teachers in \nhow they respond even if the response drifts into โexplainingโ transgenderism or gay marriage. \nOtherwise, it would start to appear that the law does not permit โneutralโ references to sexual \norientation and gender identity after all, in which case the overbreadth and void-for-vagueness \nproblems the Court identified in its December 2023 ruling would emerge again. See Parents \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 27 of 35\nDefending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669 (striking down school policy on First Amendment grounds \nwhen it allowed school officials to โdetermine on an โad hoc and subjective basisโ what speech \nisโฆsubject to discipline, and what speech is acceptableโ (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, \n408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972)).  \nStated differently, common sense dictates that students will ask questions about what \nthey read or hear. Accordingly, any reference to sexual orientation or gender identity in books \nand other classroom materials, even if โneutral,โ nonetheless may engender further discussion. \nThe  Gender  Identity/Sexual  Orientation  Restrictionโas  interpreted  under  the  canon  of \nconstitutional avoidanceโis constitutional insofar as it expects the teacher to avoid responding \nto student questions with an extensive or normative dissertation on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. The law cannot, however, be applied in such a manner as to forbid even the lightest \nexplanation of those concepts as part of the teacherโs effort to steer classroom discussion back to \nsomething โneutral.โ A teacher must be able to say things along the lines of โgay marriage is \nwhen two people of the same sex get married to each other, but we wonโt be able to talk any \nmore about that today.โ See id.  \nIn any event, these are problems for a different day. For present purposes, the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance compels the Court to interpret the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation \nRestriction as a facially-neutral prohibition on instruction relating to gender identity (cisgender \nor transgender) or sexual orientation (heterosexual or gay) as part of any compulsory curriculum, \ntest, instruction, survey, or questionnaire. As so limited, the unconstitutional applications of the \nlaw do not substantially outweigh the constitutional applications. Accordingly, the Court will \ndeny Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on the portions of the law that prohibit a \nschool district from providing any curriculum, test, instruction, survey, or questionnaire relating \nto gender identity or sexual orientation.   \n2.  The Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction Is Facially Unconstitutional in \nProhibiting School Districts from Providing Any Program or Promotion Relating to \nGender Identity and Sexual Orientation. \nThe  constitutional  analysis  is  different  for  the  parts  of  the  Gender  Identity/Sexual \nOrientation  Restriction  that  prohibit  school  districts  from  providing  any  โprogramโ  or \nโpromotionโ relating to gender identity or sexual orientation. As explained above, the Court \ncannot concludeโeven after applying the canon of constitutional avoidance and searching for \nreasonable alternative interpretationsโthat โprogramโ and โpromotionโ refer only to compulsory \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 28 of 35\nparts of the curriculum. Those words are simply too broad and disconnected from mandatory \nclassroom instruction to allow for such an interpretation. Accordingly, they prohibit school \ndistricts and teachers from doing anything within or outside the mandatory curriculum to provide \nprograms or promotion relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in grade six \nand below. This means, among other things, the law prohibits school districts and teachers from \nencouraging  or  allowing  students  in  those  grades  to  join  GSAs  or  engage  in  any  other \nextracurricular activities that revolve around gender identity and/or sexual orientation.  \nIt is not just the Court interpreting the law in this way. The record shows that school \ndistricts are, too. Specifically, school districts have: prohibited or restricted GSAs altogether or \nprevented students in grades six and below from joining them (ECF 115-11, ยถ 32; ECF 115-12, ยถ \n11; ECF 115-7, ยถยถ 25โ26; ECF 115-13, ยถยถ 24, 26, 28, 30; ECF 115-14, ยถ 18; ECF 115-15, ยถ 8); \ndiscouraged or prohibited the hanging of posters promoting GSAs in hallways where students in \ngrade six and below might see them (ECF 115-12, ยถ 11; ECF 115-7, ยถ 24; ECF 115-13, ยถ 30; \nECF 115-14, ยถ 17); prohibited school wide announcements over the loudspeakers about GSAs \n(ECF 115-14, ยถ 38); ordered the removal of all LGBTQ+ visual representations (pride flags, \nโsafe spaceโ stickers, etc.) from places where they could be seen by students in grade six and \nbelow (ECF 115-11, ยถ 30; ECF 115-15, ยถ 12; ECF 115-16, ยถ 9); and chosen not to celebrate the \nachievements of GSAs in the same way as other school clubs (ECF 115-14, ยถ 21). It is easy to \nunderstand why schools are doing so, as these are all examples of โprograms [and] promotion . . . \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ under even narrow readings of the words \nโprogram,โ โpromotion,โ and โrelating to.โ  \nUnder this plain meaning interpretation, the restrictions on โprogramsโ and โpromotionโ \nrun into constitutional problems under the First Amendment. As a starting point, a school is \ngenerally understood as a โlimited public forumโ when it allows organizations or speech outside \nthe mandatory curriculum. See, e.g., Cajune v. Indep. Sch. Dist. 194, 105 F.4th 1070, 1083 (8th \nCir. 2024); see also Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 106โ07 (2001). This \nmeans that any restrictions on speech may not discriminate based on viewpoint and must be \nreasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum. See id.  \nPlaintiffs likely will succeed in establishing that the restrictions on โprogramsโ and \nโpromotionโ in the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction are viewpoint-based. โ[A]t \ntimes, whether the government has engaged in content-based discrimination or viewpoint-based \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 29 of 35\ndiscrimination may be a fine distinction.โ Viewpoint Neutrality Now! v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. \nof Minn., 109 F.4th 1033, 1040 (8th Cir. 2024). Here, although the Restriction contains neutral \nlanguage,  Plaintiffs  and  the  State  Defendants  alike  agree  it  should  not  be  interpreted  as \nprohibiting schools from having extracurricular programs that revolve around gender identity, \nsuch as โgirlsโ and โboysโ sports teams. Accordingly, by this logic, the Restriction allows \nprograms and promotion that revolve around cisgender identity but not programs or promotion \nthat explore or revolve around transgenderism. Allowing the expression of some views on a \nsubject but not others is the epitome of a viewpoint-based restriction. See Cajune, 105 F.4th at \n1083 (holding that school district engaged in viewpoint discrimination by allowing โBlack Lives \nMatterโ posters on school walls but not โBlue Lives Matterโ posters); Gay & Lesbian Students \nAssโn, 850 F.2d at 367โ68 (holding that university engaged in viewpoint discrimination by \ndenying funds to gay and lesbian student group). \nStated differently, the State Defendants cannot have it both ways. If it is โabsurdโ to \ninterpret the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction as forbidding schools from dividing \nsports teams or other extracurricular programs into groups based on gender identity, it means the \nIowa Legislature only intended for the law to restrict speech relating to some types of gender \nidentity. This is viewpoint discrimination. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Educ. \nFund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 812 (1985) (โ[T]he purported concern to avoid controversy excited by \nparticular  groups  may  conceal  a  bias  against  the  viewpoint  advanced  by  the  excluded \nspeakers.โ); see also Gay & Lesbian Students Assโn, 850 F.2d at 367 (explaining that courts must \ndetermine the motives of government officials to determine if state action is viewpoint-based). \nThere are First Amendment problems with the restriction on programs and promotion \nrelating to sexual orientation, too. One might argue that the neutral language of the Gender \nIdentity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction  means  there  can  be  no  clubs  relating  to  sexual \norientation, period; as in, a โStraight Student Allianceโ is just as forbidden as a GSA. The \nSupreme Court, however, rejected a similar argument in Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \nUniv. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 831โ32 (1995), when it struck down a program forbidding the use of \nfunds for โreligious activityโ irrespective of the religious view being expressed. As Rosenberger \nexplained, the โexclusion of several views on [a] problem is just as offensive to the First \nAmendment as exclusion of only one . . . The dissentโs declaration that debate is not skewed so \nlong as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways.โ Id. \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 30 of 35\nSo it is here: absent a compelling governmental interest, the State cannot categorically prohibit \nclubs that express views on sexual orientationโparticularly when it appears that the only such \nclubs promote the acceptance of same-sex relationships. See Imperial Sovereign Ct. v. Knudsen, \n699 F. Supp. 3d 1018, 1043 (D. Mont. 2023) (concluding based on legislative history and context \nthat challenged law had โan overt and impermissible purpose to target the speech and expression \nof LGBTQ+ community membersโ); cf. Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. \n503, 511 (1969) (โIn the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to \nregulate their speech, students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views.โ). \nTo the extent the restrictions on โprogramsโ and โpromotionโ are not viewpoint-based, \nthey are nonetheless likely to be unconstitutional under void-for-vagueness principles. A statute \nโis unconstitutionally vague if it fails to โprovide adequate notice of the proscribed conductโ and \nlends โitself to arbitrary enforcement.โโ Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 668 (quoting \nUnited States v. Barraza, 576 F.3d 798, 806 (8th Cir. 2009)). School policies โneed not be as \ndetailed as a criminal code that imposes criminal sanctions.โ Id. โBut when a school policy \nreaches speech protected by the First Amendment, the vagueness doctrine โdemands a greater \ndegree of specificity than in other contexts.โโ Id. (quoting Stephenson v. Davenport Comm. Sch. \nDist., 110 F.3d 1303, 1308โ09 (8th Cir. 1997)). โAs such, โwhile a lesser standard of scrutiny is \nappropriate because of the public school setting, a proportionately greater level of scrutiny is \nrequired because the regulation reaches the exercise of free speech.โโ Id. (quoting Stephenson, \n110 F.3d at 1308โ09). \nHere, the only plausible way to interpret the restriction on โprogramsโ and โpromotionโ \nas  non-viewpoint-based  is  to  conclude  that  school  districts  are  forbidden  from  providing \nprograms or promotion relating to any gender identity or any sexual orientation. But this gets \nback to the absurdity problem because it would mean the law bans โgirlsโ and โboysโ sports \nteams and any other classroom or extracurricular activity that recognizes and endorses gender \nidentity. By insisting this is not how the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction should \nbe  interpreted,  the  State  Defendants  are  basically  guaranteeing  that  state  officials  will \nโdetermin[e] on an โad hoc and subjective basisโโ which speech is permitted and which is not. \nUnder Parents Defending Education, this violates the First Amendment. 83 F.4th at 669.  \nTo that end, there is a notable political dynamic at play in recent school speech cases in \nIowa. In cases like Parents Defending Education, the school district enacted a transgender-\n30 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 31 of 35\nfriendly policy requiring โrespectโ for studentsโ preferred pronouns. The Eighth Circuit struck it \ndown because it went too far in restricting the First Amendment rights of students who may wish \nto express contrary views, such as a student who โexpresses discomfort about sharing a bathroom \nwith someone who is transgender, argues that biological sex is immutable during a debate in \nsocial studies class, or expresses an opinion about the participation of transgender students on \nsingle-sex athletic teams.โ 83 F.4th at 668. The proverbial shoe is on the other foot in the Gender \nIdentity/Sexual  Orientation  Restriction,  which  shuts  down  clubs  and  activities  that  support \ntransgenderism for students in grade six and below. But the same First Amendment principles \napply: the Iowa Legislature cannot pass a โcapaciousโ law that gives state officials subjective \nand virtually unfettered discretion to decide which speech it likes and which it does not on a \nparticular topic. Id. at 669.  \nThe last step in the analysis is to determine whether the unconstitutional applications of \nthe law substantially outweigh the constitutional applications. See NetChoice, 603 U.S. at 724. \nOn that issue, Plaintiffs have offered evidence that school districts across the state have, among \nother things, closed GSAs altogether, forbidden students in grade six and below from joining \nthem, and restricted where and how GSAs can provide promotional materials. These applications \nof the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction are all unconstitutional under the First \nAmendment. See Cajune, 105 F.4th at 1083; Gay & Lesbian Students Assโn, 850 F.2d at 367โ68. \nBy contrast, the State Defendants have not established any constitutional applications of the law \nexcept, at most, when a โprogramโ or โpromotionโ is provided as part of mandatory classroom \ncurriculum. But other parts of the statute already prohibit instruction relating to gender identity \nand sexual orientation as part of the mandatory curriculum, and thus the words โprogramโ and \nโpromotionโ  have  no  independent  significance  in  that  context.  Instead,  โprogramโ  and \nโpromotionโ take on unique meaning only when school districts and teachers provide activities \nor  opportunities  relating  to  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation  outside  the  mandatory \ncurriculum. As the prohibition on those activities is inconsistent with the First Amendment, the \nunconstitutional  applications  of the  law  substantially  outweigh  the  constitutional ones  as  it \nrelates to โprogram[s]โ and โpromotionโ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation.  \n3.  Summary. \nThe Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction does not violate the First Amendment \ninsofar  as  it  prohibits  school  districts  and  teachers  from  providing  any  curriculum,  test, \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 32 of 35\ninstruction, survey, or questionnaire relating to gender identity and sexual orientation because \nthis part of the Restriction is facially neutral, applies only to mandatory curriculum, and does not \nprevent  neutral  references  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation.4  The  Restriction  does, \nhowever, violate the First Amendment when it prohibits programs and promotion relating to \ngender identity and sexual orientation because these restrictions cannot be interpreted to apply \nonly  to  mandatory  curriculum.  The  restrictions  therefore  unconstitutionally  interfere  with \nstudentsโ First Amendment rights.  \nVII.  LEGAL  ANALYSIS:  CONSTITUTIONALITY  OF  THE  GENDER  IDENTITY \nNOTIFICATION PROVISION. \nIowa Code ยง 279.78(3) requires a โlicensed practitionerโ to inform a school district \nadministrator if a student โrequests an accommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs \ngender identity ... including a request that the licensed practitioner address the student using a \nname or pronoun that is different than the name or pronoun assigned to the student in the school \ndistrictโs registration forms or records.โ In turn, the school district administrator โshall report the \nstudentโs request to the studentโs parent or guardian.โ Id. Plaintiffs argue that this statute is \nunconstitutionally vague because it fails to define โaccommodation.โ   \nThe governing precedent is the Eighth Circuitโs recent decision in Parents Defending \nEducation, 83 F.4th at 668โ69. There, the school district enacted a policy subjecting students and \nstaff to discipline if they did not โrespectโ the gender identity of other students. Id. at 668. The \nEighth Circuit concluded that a parent group was โlikely to succeed on its claim that this portion \nof the policy is void for vagueness.โ Id. The Eighth Circuit explained that the policy did not \ndefine the term โrespectโ and therefore did not provide sufficient guidance about which speech \nwould be subject to discipline. Id.  \nA similar problem exists here. The Gender Identification Notification Provision requires \nschools to notify parents when a student requests an โaccommodation,โ which is a broad term \nthat is not defined in the statute. Other resources are similarly unhelpful. Merriam-Websterโs \nCollegiate Dictionary, for example, defines โaccommodationโ to mean โthe providing of what is \nneeded or desired for convenienceโ or โadaptation, adjustment.โ See Accommodation, MERRIAM-\n \n4 Based on the same facially neutral interpretation, the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction does not \nviolate the equal protection clause as to any curriculum, test, instruction, survey, or questionnaire relating to gender \nidentity and sexual orientation. See, e.g., Johnson v. City of Minneapolis, 152 F.3d 859, 862 (8th Cir. 1998) \n(recognizing that equal protection claims require differential treatment). The equal protection analysis might be \ndifferent under the restrictions on programs and promotion, but the Court need not undertake it because it is already \nenjoining those restrictions on First Amendment grounds.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 33 of 35\nWEBSTERโS COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2020). This is a โcapacious concept.โ Parents \nDefending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669. Moreover, the reporting requirement only applies when the \nrequest for an accommodation is โintended to affirm the studentโs gender identity.โ One can \nimagine any number of judgment calls, including: a student asking to be called by a nickname \nthat may or may not have a gender connotation, such as โHarriettโ asking to be called โHarryโ or \nโJuliaโ asking to be called โJ.R.โ; a (biological) male choosing a pink pencil from the teacherโs \nsupply; a female asking โto sit with the boysโ at lunch; a female asking if itโs ok to wear pants \ninstead of a skirt at a school music concert; and a male consistently choosing to write reports \nabout female historical figures. As the Eighth Circuit put it in Parents Defending Education, \nโ[t]he  undefined  term  [โaccommodationโ]  leaves  the  policy  open  to  unpredictable \ninterpretations, and creates a substantial risk that school administrators [or state officials] may \narbitrarily enforce the policy.โ Id.  \nThere  is  one  exception  to  the  vagueness  problem.  The  Gender Identity  Notification \nProvision  states  that  one  example  of  an  โaccommodationโ  that  triggers  the  notification \nrequirement is when a student โrequest[s] that the licensed practitioner address the student using \na โฆ pronoun that is different than the โฆ pronoun assigned to the student in the school districtโs \nregistration forms or records.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3). This example is clear enough to provide \nfair notice to educators and other school officials about what is expected. Accordingly, the \nProvision is not void-for-vagueness insofar as it requires notice to parents when a student asks to \nbe addressed with a different pronoun than the one in school registration forms or records.  \nWhen some parts of a law are constitutionally valid but others are not, the Iowa Supreme \nCourt has recognized that courts may in some circumstances โsever the offending portion from \nthe enactment and leave the remainder intact.โ Breeden v. Iowa Depโt of Corrs., 887 N.W.2d \n602, 608 (Iowa 2016) (quoting Am. Dog Owners Assโn, Inc. v. City of Des Moines, 469 N.W.2d \n416, 418 (Iowa 1991) (per curiam)). See also Iowa Code ยง 4.12. Here, it is relatively simple to \nsever  the  constitutional  and  unconstitutional  portions  of  the  Gender  Identity  Notification \nProvision. The law is constitutional and therefore enforceable to the extent it requires schools \nand teachers to provide notice to parents when a student requests to be addressed with a different \npronoun. It is unconstitutional and unenforceable to the extent it requires notice when a student \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 34 of 35\nrequests some other โaccommodationโ that might be related to gender identity. See Parents \nDefending Education, 83 F.4th at 668โ69.5 \nVIII.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS. \nโWhen a plaintiff has shown a likely violation of his or her First Amendment rights, the \nother requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction are generally deemed to have been \nsatisfied.โ Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 692 F.3d 864, 870 (8th Cir. \n2012).  Thus,  injunctive  relief  is  appropriate  as  to  the  restrictions  on  โprogram[s]โ  and \nโpromotionโ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation in the Gender Identity/Sexual \nOrientation Restriction simply because Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their First \nAmendment challenge. See id.; see also Carson, 978 F.3d at 1059 (โWhile no single factor is \ndeterminative, the probability of success factor is the most significant.โ (internal punctuation and \ncitation omitted)). The same is true for the portion of the Gender Identity Notification Provision \nthat is unconstitutionally vague.  \nNonetheless,  in  an  abundance  of  caution,  the  Court  will  briefly  analyze  the  other \npreliminary injunction factors. The irreparable harm factor weighs squarely in favor of imposing \na preliminary injunction. โIt is well-established that โ[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for \neven minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.โโ Powell v. Noble, \n798 F.3d 690, 702 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976))). Here, the \nStudent Plaintiffs face such a loss because they are being denied the opportunity to exercise their \nFirst Amendment rights to free expression and association. Moreover, the Educator Plaintiffs are \nat risk of termination, loss of licensure, or other consequences if they are deemed to have \nviolated the unconstitutional portions of the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction and \nGender Identity Notification Provision. By contrast, while the temporary invalidation of portions \nof a duly enacted state law is a serious and significant remedy, school districts retain the \ndiscretion they have always had to control curriculum and otherwise set expectations for students \nand teachers. The balancing of equities therefore weighs in favor of injunctive relief, as does the \npublic interest. See Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669 (awarding preliminary injunctive \nrelief).  \n \n5 Plaintiffs also challenge the Gender Identity Notification Provision under the equal protection clause and as \nviewpoint-discrimination under the First Amendment. The Educator Plaintiffs only have standing to raise the void-\nfor-vagueness challenge, however, and no other Plaintiffs have standing at all. The Court therefore will not address \nthe equal protection or viewpoint-discrimination arguments.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ     Document 141     Filed 05/15/25     Page 35 of 35\nIX.  CONCLUSION. \nThe Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction as it relates to the Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation Restriction. Defendants are \nENJOINED from enforcing the restrictions in Iowa Code ยง 279.80(2) on any โprogramโ or \nโpromotionโ  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  because  those  restrictions \nunconstitutionally  restrain  speech  outside  the  mandatory  classroom  curriculum.  Conversely, \nDefendants are not enjoined from enforcing the restrictions in Iowa Code ยง 279.78(2) on any \nโcurriculum,โ โtest,โ โinstruction,โ โsurvey,โ or โquestionnaireโ relating to gender identity or \nsexual  orientation.  Those  restrictions  apply  narrowly  to  mandatory  classroom  curriculum \nrevolving around or focusing on gender identity or sexual orientation and therefore are not \nfacially unconstitutional. \nNext, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART  Plaintiffsโ Motion for \nPreliminary  Injunction  on  the  Gender  Identity  Notification  Provision.  Defendants  are \nENJOINED from enforcing alleged violations of Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3) in any circumstance \nother than when a student requests to be addressed by a different pronoun than the one assigned \nto the student in the school districtโs registration forms or records.  \nFinally, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on the Library \nProvision. Defendants are ENJOINED from enforcing the restrictions set forth therein.  \nNo bond has been requested or will be required.  \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.   \n  Dated: May 15, 2025                    ______________________________________     \n                   STEPHEN H.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA  \nCENTRAL DIVISION \n \n \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS f/k/a GLBT YOUTH IN  Case No.   4:23-cv-474   \nIOWA SCHOOLS TASK FORCE, et al.,   \n   \n    Plaintiffs,   RENEWED MOTION FOR \n  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n  v. \n \nKIM REYNOLDS, in her official capacity as \nGovernor of the State of Iowa et al.,  \n \n    Defendants.  \n \n \n  Plaintiffs hereby move for a preliminary injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65 to prevent further irreparable injury pending final adjudication of Plaintiffsโ action. \nThis Motion is submitted upon Plaintiffsโ First Amended Complaint and is supported by \nthe accompanying Brief in Support of Plaintiffsโ Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction of \nSF 496, the sworn Declarations of Becky Tayler, Executive Director of Plaintiff Iowa Safe Schools \n(โISSโ); Hannah Mitchell, Director of Youth Engagement of Plaintiff ISS; Jordan Mix, Director \nof Educational Programming for Plaintiff ISS; Plaintiff P.B.-P.; Plaintiff A.C., Parent and Next \nFriend Richard Carlson; Parent and Next Friend Ulrike Carlson; Plaintiff T.S.; Plaintiff B.F.S.; \nParent and Next Friend Brigit Stevens; Plaintiff B.F.; Plaintiff James Doe; Plaintiff Daniel \nGutmann; Plaintiff Alyson Telford; non-party Declarant F.J.; non-party Declarant Cindy Harper; \nnon-party Declarant Elesha Gayman Shahinllari and any other material the Court may consider at \nany hearing on this Motion. These Declarations include additional evidence of irreparable harm \nthat has occurred to student members of ISS and chapter GSA members since the law took effect, \nincluding in the months after the Courtโs grant of a partial preliminary injunction as to the other \n1 \n \n\nprovisions of SF 496 on December 29, 2023, and the Eighth Circuit Courtโs opinion reversing this \nCourtโs order, vacating the partial injunction, and remanding the case back to this Court for \nreconsideration of Plaintiffsโ as-applied challenges, and facial challenges in light of Moody v. \nNetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383 (2024). \nAs  Plaintiffs  set  forth  in  their  accompanying  Brief  in  Support  of  Plaintiffsโ \nRenewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims. Senate File 496, 2023 Iowa Acts ch. 91 (โSF 496โ or โthe lawโ), violates the First and \nFourteenth Amendments through its three principle provisions: the โLibrary Restriction,โ โGender \nIdentity/Sexual Orientation Prohibitionโ (or, โGISO Prohibitionโ),  and  the โGender  Identity \nNotification Provision.โ Plaintiffs move for preliminary injunction on their claims the Library \nRestriction is overbroad, vague, and infringes upon their First Amendment right to receive \ninformation; the GISO Prohibition is overbroad, vague, and infringes upon their First Amendment \nrights to engage in speech, expressive conduct, and expressive association; and the Gender Identity \nNotification Provision is vague and infringes upon their First Amendment right to engage in \nexpressive association. To obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs โneed only establish a \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits of any one of [their] claims.โ Richland/Wilkin Joint Powers \nAuth. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engโrs, 826 F.3d 1030, 1040 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Am. Rivers v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engโrs, 271 F. Supp. 2d 230, 250 (D.D.C. 2003)).  \nAs Plaintiffs establish in the accompanying Brief in Support of Plaintiffsโ Renewed Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable injury \nabsent an injunction. The balance of equities also is in Plaintiffsโ favor, and it is โalways in the \npublic interest to prevent the violation of a partyโs constitutional rights.โ D.M. by Bao Xiong v. \nMinn. State High Sch. League, 917 F.3d 994, 1004 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670 \n2 \n \n\nF.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. 2012)). Plaintiffs request that the Court waive the requirement of bond \nin Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c). Richland/Wilkin, 826 F.3d at 1043 (whether to require \nbond is within courtโs discretion). Public interest litigation is a recognized exception to the bond \nrequirement, especially where, as here, requiring a bond would injure the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs and the relief sought would not pose a hardship to government Defendants.

Plaintiffs submit to the Court this Complaint requesting \na declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against all Defendants, \ntheir  employees,  agents,  and  successors  in  office.  Contemporaneously  with  this Complaint, \nPlaintiffs are submitting a Motion for Preliminary Injunction with Brief and Declarations in \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 3 of 96\n \nsupport. In support of their Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs state the \nfollowing: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plaintiffs are a non-profit advocacy organization serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer, or questioning (โLGBTQ+โ) Iowa youth, and eight LGBTQ+ students from \nIowa who attend Iowa public schools and whose ages range from nine to seventeen. They challenge \nas unconstitutional SF 496, a sweeping piece of legislation signed into law by Governor Kim \nReynolds on May 26, 2023, which primarily amends portions of Title VII (Education and Cultural \nAffairs) of the Iowa Code. \n2.  On its face, in its intent and purpose, and as applied, SF 496 forces educators to \nsilence their LGBTQ+ students and deny them access to books, information, and ideas about \nsexual orientation and gender identity. SF 496โs vague and overbroad language invites arbitrary \nand discriminatory restrictions on the rights of Plaintiffs and other LGBTQ+ students, stigmatizing \nthem,  preventing  them  from  associating  with  one  another  for  purposes  of  mutual  support, \neducation, and advocacy, and depriving them of the comfort of knowing that other LGBTQ+ \npeople exist and are happy and healthy members of our community. \n3.  First, SF 496 bans any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, \nor instruction relating to sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through grade six \n(the โdonโt say gay or transโ provision). SF 496, Div. II, ยง 16 (Iowa Code ยง 279.80(1)-(2)). Second, \nit mandates โage-appropriateโ education for all grades and defines โage-appropriateโ to ban \nโdescriptionsโ or โvisual depictionsโ of a โsex actโ except in health class, without clarifying \nwhether any level of generality is acceptable (the โall-ages banโ). SF 496, Div. I, ยง 1 (Iowa Code \nยง 256.11 (unnumbered paragraph 1)); id. ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(2)-(4); id. ยง 4 (Iowa Code \nยง 256.11(19)(a)-(b)). Third, SF 496 requires school districts to ban from school libraries all books \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 4 of 96\n \nwith descriptions of sex acts except for certain religious texts, such as the Bible, and facilitates \nanonymous complaints by parents requesting the removal of material from classrooms and \nlibraries (the โlibrary banโ). Id. ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(1)-(a)(2); SF 496, Div. II, ยง 13 \n(Iowa Code ยง 279.77(1)-(4) (facilitation of anonymous complaints)) (together with the donโt say \ngay or trans provision and all-ages ban, the โbook banโ provisions). Fourth, the law mandates that \nschool officials notify a studentโs parent or guardian when a student asks to use a name or pronouns \ndifferent from those in the schoolโs records, even if the officials are aware that a student will be \nrendered unsafe or vulnerable to abuse as a result (the โforced outingโ provision). SF 496, Div. II, \nยง 14 (Iowa Code ยง 279.78(1), (3)-(4). \n4.  Large portions of SF 496 took effect on July 1, 2023, and with enforcement to begin \non January 1, 2024, its impact was immediate and severe. As the 2023โ2024 school year began, \nschool districts across the state developed varying and inconsistent lists of books to remove from \nclassrooms and libraries. School districts banned books based on their content and viewpoint, \ntargeting stories with LGBTQ+ characters, themes, and authors. Schools tore down rainbow flags \nand โsafe placeโ signs from hallways, erasing messages of inclusion for LGBTQ+ students and \nstaff.  Schools  prevented  Gender  Sexuality  Alliances  (โGSAsโ)โnon-curricular  clubs  for \nLGBTQ+ students and their allies to find fellowship and communityโfrom meeting on the same \nterms as other non-curricular clubs. SF 496 also has obstructed and interfered with schoolsโ \nobligations to protect their students from anti-LGBTQ+ harassment and bullying.   \n5.  SF 496 impermissibly deprives Iowa students of access to information and ideas \nand chills LGBTQ+ studentsโ speech based on content and viewpoint in violation of the First \nAmendment and the Equal Access Act. SF 496โs donโt say gay or trans, all-ages, book ban, and \nforced outing provisions, which target LGBTQ+ students on the basis of the content and viewpoint \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 5 of 96\n \nof their speech, coupled with the lawโs draconian enforcement measures, communicate to these \nyoung people that they are unworthy of recognition or respect and too shameful even to be \nacknowledged. In short, โthe message to LGBT kids is very clear: we donโt want you here.โ1 Iowa \nstudents have gotten the message. They now self-censor, refraining from engaging in protected \nspeech and expression for fear of being bullied, harassed, or disciplined by teachers simply for \nacknowledging their own sexual orientation or gender identity. \n6.  By design, SF 496 also singles out Iowa students and discriminates against them \nbased on their sexual orientation and gender identity in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.   \n7.  SF 496 unconstitutionally denies LGBTQ+ students access to information and ideas \nand silences them at a pivotal moment in their lives, when these studentsโlike all people their \nageโdevelop their own sense of self. Should SF 496 continue in effect, a generation of LGBTQ+ \nIowans will grow up isolated and afraid. School-going Iowans will not view their state and local \ngovernments as the representative institutions they are meant to be.

IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS serves at least 4,000 students, representing over 100 \nmember  GSAs  in  school  districts  across  the  state.  IOWA  SAFE  SCHOOLS  also  provides \nprofessional development, licensure renewal, and graduate credits to educators individually and \ndistrict-wide, reaching over 4,000 educators annually. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS partners with \nlocal nonprofits to provide programming and events that reach additional students, families, and \neducators. IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS also performs data collection with respect to incidents of \nbullying, harassment, and discrimination experienced by LGBTQ+ youth in Iowa schools, securely \ntracking โvictim data,โ and providing resources and technical assistance to the students affected. \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLS reports this data in the aggregate to the Victim Assistance Section of the \nAttorney General of Iowa.  \n10.

SF  496  has  altered  the  landscape  for  Iowa  schools  and  students  through  its \nunconstitutional and discriminatory donโt say gay or trans, all-ages ban, book ban, and forced \nouting provisions.     \nDonโt Say Gay or Trans Provision \n43.  SF  496  includes  a  sweeping  section  titled,  โSexual  orientation  and  gender \nidentityโprohibited instruction,โ that forbids any mention of sexual orientation or gender identity \nfrom kindergarten through the sixth grade, in or outside of the classroom. Specifically, the law \nprohibits school districts from providing โany program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, \npromotion,  or  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  to  students  in \nkindergarten through grade six.โ SF 496, Div. II, ยง 16 (Iowa Code ยง 279.80(1)-(2)).  This \nprohibition applies even to human growth and development instruction, i.e., health class. Id. ยง 2 \n(Iowa Code ยง 256.11(2)-(3)); SF 496, Div. II, ยง 9 (Iowa Code ยง 279.50(1), (1A)).  \n44.  These seven separate prohibited types of speech encompass all activities within a \nschool. Iowa statutes do not define the terms, โprogram, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, \npromotion, or instruction,โ but their scope is broad. Iowa regulations define the term โeducational \nprogramโ as โthe entire offering of the school, including out-of-class activities and the sequence \nof curriculum areas and activitiesโ and the term curriculum as โall the courses offered.โ  Iowa \nAdmin. Code r. 281-12.2.   \n45.  The โdonโt say gay or transโ prohibition reaches every aspect of a studentโs \nexperience until the seventh grade. It covers materials available in classrooms, school libraries, \nout-of-class activities, and GSAs.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 14 of 96\n \n46.  SF 496 includes similarly broad definitions of  โgender identityโ and โsexual \norientation.โ They are defined to encompass any gender identity, including cisgender identities, \nand any sexual orientation, including heterosexuality. SF 496, Div. II, ยง 16 (Iowa Code ยง \n279.80(1)); see also Iowa Code ยง 216.2(10), (14).  \n47.  Further, SF 496โs use of the phrase โrelating toโ in the donโt say gay or trans \nprovision contains no limitation of intent or import, raising questions as to whether any level of \ngenerality is acceptable or whether merely acknowledging a real or fictional personโs gender or \nmarital status violates the law.  \n48.  By failing to provide clear boundaries on the speech prohibited, SF 496 invites and \nhas resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. For example, the donโt say gay or trans \nprovision provides that it is applicable to kindergarten through sixth grade, but sixth grade in Iowa \nschools may be taught in middle schools or junior high schools, along with higher grade levels. \nAdditionally, some Iowa school districts do not maintain separate elementary and secondary \nschool libraries, leaving Defendant School Districts and other school districts in the State of Iowa \nto apply this provision to grade levels past sixth, even though SF 496 does not provide for such \nrestriction. \nAll-Ages Ban \n49.  SF 496 also mandates โage-appropriateโ education for all grades and defines that \nterm to ban โdescriptionsโ or โvisual depictionsโ of a โsex actโ except in health class, again without \nclarifying whether any level of generality is acceptable (the โall-ages banโ) SF 496, Div. I, ยง 1 \n(Iowa Code ยง 256.11 (unnumbered paragraph 1)); id. ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(2)-(4)); id. ยง 4 \n(Iowa Code ยง 256.11(19)(a)-(b)). \n50.  Defendant ISBE is required to adopt rules and an accreditation procedure for all \nschools from kindergarten through twelfth grade that require an โage-appropriateโ approach to the \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 15 of 96\n \nโeducational programโ and instruction and creates a new definition of โage-appropriate.โ Id. ยง 1 \n(Iowa Code ยง 256.11 (unnumbered paragraph 1)). Iowa regulations define the term โeducational \nprogramโ as โthe entire offering of the school, including out-of-class activities and the sequence \nof curriculum areas and activities.โ  Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.2.   \n51.  The new definition of โage-appropriateโ prohibits for all grade levels โany material \nwith descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act,โ for all purposes, with the limited exception of \ncertain human growth  and development instruction, which may cover the topic of โhuman \nsexuality.โ SF 496, Div. I, ยง 4 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(19)(a)(1)-(2)); see also Iowa Code ยง 279.50.  \n52.  SF 496 borrows its definition of a โsex actโ from Iowa criminal law. SF 496, Div. \nI, ยง 4 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(19)(a)(1) (citing Iowa Code ยง 702.17)).3 However, the law does not \ndefine what constitutes a โdescriptionโ or โvisual depictionโ of a sex act.  \n53.  All  school  districts  must  comply  with  this  โage-appropriateโ  โapproachโ  to \neducation, which encompasses all educational programming, including materials in and outside of \nthe classroom and in school libraries.  \n \n3  Iowa Code ยง 702.17 defines โsex actโ for purposes of offenses such as lascivious conduct as any \nsexual contact between two or more persons by any of the following:  \n1. Penetration of the penis into the vagina or anus.  \n2. Contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus or by contact between the \ngenitalia of one person and the genitalia or anus of another person.  \n3. Contact between the finger, hand, or other body part of one person and the genitalia or \nanus of another person, except in the course of examination or treatment by a person \nlicensed pursuant to chapter 148, 148C, 151, or 152.  \n4. Ejaculation onto the person of another.  \n5. By use of artificial sexual organs or substitutes therefor in contact with the genitalia or \nanus.  \n6. The touching of a personโs own genitals or anus with a finger, hand, or artificial sexual \norgan or other similar device at the direction of another person.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 16 of 96\n \nBook Ban Provisions \n54.  SF 496 requires school districts to ban books and materials containing descriptions \nor depictions of โsex actsโ from all Iowa school libraries except for certain religious texts, such as \nthe Bible (the โlibrary banโ); to ban such books and materials from all educational programming \nin all Iowa schools with limited exception for health class through the all-ages ban; to ban books \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation from school libraries in schools with kindergarten \nto sixth grades through the donโt say gay or trans provision; to facilitate anonymous complaints by \nparents requesting the removal of material from classrooms and libraries (โanonymous complaintโ \nprovision); and to investigate and discipline school employees for violating the library ban (the \nโenforcementโ provision) (collectively, the โbook banโ provisions). SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (Iowa Code \nยง 256.11(9)(a)(1)-(a)(2) (library ban and enforcement provision)); id. ยง 1 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11 \n(unnumbered paragraph 1) (all-ages ban); SF 496, Div. II, ยง 16 (Iowa Code ยง 279.80(1)-(2) (donโt \nsay  gay  or  trans  provision));  id.  ยง  13  (Iowa  Code  ยง  279.77(1)-(4)  (anonymous  complaint \nprovision)). \n55.  SF 496 specifically prohibits school library programs from having materials that \ndepict or describe a โsex act.โ Each school district, including the Defendant School Districts, is \nrequired to โestablish a kindergarten through grade twelve library program that . . . contains only \nage-appropriate materials,โ as defined above. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(1)). \n56.  SF 496 makes an explicit exception for certain religious texts such as the Bible, \nTorah, and Koran. Libraries must retain these religious texts regardless of the nature or number of \nsex acts described. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(1)); see also Iowa Code ยง 280.6.   \n57.    In contrast, SF 496 does not define what might constitute a โdescriptionโ or \nโvisual depictionโ of a sex act in a book or whether any level of generality is acceptable. The scope \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 17 of 96\n \nand breadth of the book ban thus is not clear, and its vagueness invites school districts to implement \nthe ban in a broad and sweeping manner.   \n58.  The scope of SF 496โs don't say gay or trans provision, which prohibits schools \nfrom providing โany program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six,โ also \nrequires schools with kindergarten through sixth grade to remove from school and classroom \nlibraries books relating to gender identity or sexual orientation. \n59.  SF 496โs all-ages ban similarly requires the removal from the school as a whole, \nincluding school libraries, classrooms,  and spaces outside the classroom, of all โmaterialsโ \ndepicting or describing a sex act, with a limited exception for health class. \n60.  In addition to mandating that schools ban books, SF 496 establishes a procedure \nthat facilitates the filing of anonymous complaints by parents requesting the removal of material \nfrom classrooms and libraries. Specifically, Defendant School Districts must publish on school \nwebsites a โdetailed explanationโ of policies and procedures to allow a parent or guardian of a \nstudent enrolled in the school district to request anonymously the removal of books and other \nmaterials from school classrooms and libraries. SF 496, Div. II, ยง 13 (Iowa Code ยง 279.77(1)-(4)). \nDefendant School Districts also must post on their websites a comprehensive list of books \navailable to students in school libraries. Id. (Iowa Code ยง 279.77(3)).4   \n61.  The law enforces its book ban provisions by threatening the accreditation of schools \nthat fail to comply and the licensure of employees who knowingly violate it. Specifically, the law \nprovides: โIf, after investigation, the department determines that a school district or employee of \n \n4 โHowever, for school years beginning prior to July 1, 2025, if the school district does not use an \nelectronic catalog, the school district may request a waiver from this requirement from the \ndepartment of education.โ SF 496, Div. II, ยง 13 (Iowa Code ยง 279.77(3)). (3). \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 18 of 96\n \nthe school district has violated the provisions . . . related to library programs containing only age-\nappropriate materials, beginning January 1, 2024, the school district or employee of the school \ndistrictโ can be subject to discipline ranging from a written warning to proceedings that could \nresult in revocation of an employeeโs license or certification. SF 496, Div. I, ยง 2 (Iowa Code ยง \n256.11(9)(a)(1)). \nForced Outing Provision \n62.  Finally, SF 496 includes a โforced outingโ provision. This provision requires school \nofficials to notify a studentโs parent or guardian whenever a student asks school officials to respect \nthe studentโs gender identity. SF 496, Div. II, ยง 14 (Iowa Code ยง 279.78(3)).  \n63.  Specifically, SF 496 states: โIf a student . . . requests an accommodation that is \nintended to affirm the studentโs gender identity from a licensed practitioner employed by the \nschool district,โ the licensed practitioner must โreport the studentโs request to an administrator,โ \nwho then โshall report the studentโs request to the studentโs parent or guardian.โ Id.  \n64.  The forced outing provision includes one example of what might qualify as an a \nrequested โaccommodationโ: โa request that the licensed practitioner address the student using a \nname or pronoun that is different than the name or pronoun assigned to the student in the school \ndistrictโs registration forms or records.โ Id. SF 496, however, does not clarify what other conduct \nmight constitute a reportable request, and it does not limit the obligation to requests made during \nschool hours or school activities.  \n65.  The forced outing provision mandates that school districts, including Defendant \nSchool Districts, their administrators, and their employees, make this notification to parents and \nguardians regardless of the studentโs wishes or plans for sharing this information with their parents \nor guardians; regardless of whether a student will be rendered unsafe as a result; regardless of \nwhether a student may have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality when speaking with a \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 19 of 96\n \nschool psychologist, counselor, or nurse; and regardless of ethical obligations these professionals \nmay have to protect confidentiality. The law contains no process for determining whether the \nstudentโs safety or wellbeing will be threatened as result of such a disclosure. It also does not \ncontain any exception allowing for a school employee to avoid parental notification when the \nemployee already knows that such notification imminently will endanger the student.  \n66.  The enforcement mechanism for the forced outing mandate is similar to the lawโs \nprohibition  on  library  materials.  Defendant  IDOE  is  required  to  enforce  this  mandate  by \ninvestigating potential violations and imposing disciplinary action ranging from written warnings \nto proceedings that could result in loss of licensure or certification. Id. (Iowa Code ยง 279.78(4)). \nProposed Rulemaking \n67.  On November 15, 2023, Defendant ISBE issued proposed rules implementing SF \n496, including new enforcement mechanisms the law requires. Although the rulemaking purports \nto clarify aspects of SF 496, the proposed rules raise new questions and do not address the \nvagueness of the statutory language in any meaningful way.  \n68.  For example, the proposed rules purport to limit the definition of โage-appropriate,โ \nwhich the statute defines as excluding โany material with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex \nact,โ by adding, โA reference or mention of a sex act in a way that does not describe or visually \ndepict a sex act as defined in that section is not included in the previous sentence.โ Iowa State \nBoard of Education, Notice of Intended Action, Item 2 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.2) \n(hereinafter, โProposed Rulesโ).  \n69.  This proposed rule does not clarify when a โreferenceโ or โmention of a sex actโ \ndoes or does not qualify as โdescrib[ing]โ a โsex act.โ  \n70.  This proposed rule also does not explain whether enforcement turns on the brevity \nof the description, whether the description is merely implicit, the degree to which the description \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 20 of 96\n \nplays a role in a broader narrative, whether the average person would find the reference to appeal \nto the prurient interest, or take into account the literary, artistic, political, or scientific value of the \nwork. \n71.   The proposed rules modify the enforcement provisions of SF 496โs book banning \nprovisions by specifying that Defendant IDOE โmay exercise enforcement discretion if any \nviolation is voluntarily and permanently corrected prior to the department making a determination \nof a violation.โ Proposed Rules, Item 4 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.3(12)(d)(3)).  \n72.  This  enforcement  โdiscretion,โ  however,  is  merely  an  inducement  to  greater \ncurtailment of expression, inviting school districts to remove books in response to even a hint of \nan anonymous challenge, without ever having determined whether the specific text meets the \nstatute. \n73.  With respect to SF 496โs donโt say gay or trans provision, the proposed rules add: \nโIn monitoring and enforcing this subrule, the department will not conclude that a neutral statement \nregarding sexual orientation or gender identity violates [the law].โ Proposed Rules, Item 5 \n(amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-12.3(15)). \n74.  Far from clarifying the statute, this proposed rule prompts further questions and \nhighlights and doubles down on the impermissibly content-based and viewpoint-based nature of \nSF 496โs prohibitions. For example, what qualifies as a neutral statement about sexual orientation \nor gender identity? Would a GSA advisor violate the rule if she allowed sixth grade GSA members \nto meet to discuss the need for greater LGBTQ+ civil rights, but comply if students instead \nmentioned their sexual orientations incidentally while introducing themselves and discussed the \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 21 of 96\n \nlunch menu? Does a book in a fourth-grade classroom violate the rule if it portrays a childโs same-\nsex parents as loving and attentive, but comply if the reference to gay parents is merely an aside?5   \n75.  The proposed rules also fail to provide clarity to school districts with mixed K-12 \nlibrary programs or that use the local community library for their students.  A proposed rule simply \ninstructs  these  districts  to  โexercise  reasonable,  physical,  administrative,  and  technological \ncontrols to ensure that materials accessible to students have access to age-appropriate materials \nbased on their age and grade.โ Proposed Rules, Item 4 (amending Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-\n12.3(12)(d)(4)).  \n76.  The proposed rules also purport to explain school officialsโ obligation under SF 496 \nto report students who seek an โaccommodationโ relating to their name or pronouns: โConcerning \na studentโs request to use a name that is different from the name on the studentโs registration forms \nor records, that request is governed by this subrule only if the request is an accommodation \nintended to affirm a studentโs gender identity.โ Proposed Rules, Item 5 (amending Iowa Admin. \nCode r. 281-12.3(16)(b)).  \n77.  This proposed subrule would require licensed practitioners to interrogate every \nstudent as to the purpose of their preferred name or nickname, imposing unique burdens on gender-\nnonconforming and transgender students forced to justify their own names. For example, under \nthis proposed subrule, school officials may acquiesce to a studentโs request to use โBobโ instead \nof โRobert,โ without triggering the reporting requirement, but they may have to report Samantha \n \n5 Tom Barton and Caleb McCullough, Iowa Board of Education advances rules on school library \nrestrictions, The Gazette (Nov. 15, 2023) https://www.thegazette.com/state-government/iowa-\nboard-of-education-advances-rules-on-school-library-restrictions/ (โThe rules allow for books to \nhave โneutralโ mentions of LGBTQ characters, [Thomas] Mayes [General Counsel for the Iowa \nDepartment of Education] said. This includes an โobservation regarding a book characterโs sexual \norientation or gender identity that stops short of being a promotion.โโ).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 22 of 96\n \nfor seeking to be referred to as โSamโ and would be required to report Susan for seeking to be \nreferred to as โSimon.โ  \n78.  Alternatively, a school district might reason that โgender identity,โ as defined by \nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act and incorporated into SF 496, includes cisgender identities, and any \nnickname might be understood to confirm a studentโs gender identity, whether that is transgender, \nnonbinary, gender non-conforming, or cisgender.  Accordingly, Thomasโs request to go by Tom6 \nwould affirm his identity as a cisgender male.  \n79.  Unless an anti-LGBTQ+ intent is read into the law, the proposed subrule does \nnothing to clarify the scope of the forced outing provision.   \n80.  The President of the Iowa State Education Association summarized the proposed \nrules as follow:  \nThe proposed rules do nothing to address the chilling effect the law created. \nSo far, hundreds of book titles have been pulled from shelves across the \nstate, and weโve created ridiculous amounts of paperwork over topics like \nstudent nicknames. Public education professionals will still continue to \nspend valuable instructional time trying to meet vague state mandates.7 \nLegislative History of SF 496 \n81.  The landscape of Iowa law before the passage of SF 496, along with the law's \nlegislative history, underscore that SF 496 was not enacted for any legitimate purpose and \ndemonstrate that SF 496 is an attempt to target LGBTQ+ students and prescribe what shall be \northodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion in Iowa schools. \n82.  Prior  to  SF  496,  Iowa  law  contained  numerous  protections  for  students  that \nprotected them from exposure to harmful materials in school.  \n \n6 See Barton and McCullough, supra note 5 (โFor example, โThomas to Tomโ is fine, Mayes \nsaid.โ). \n7  Barton and McCullough, supra note 5 (quoting Mike Beranek). \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 23 of 96\n \n83.  Iowa law prohibited the dissemination of obscene material to minors and the \nadmission of minors to premises where obscene material is exhibited. See Iowa Code ยงยง 728.2, \n728.3.  \n84.  Iowa law also provided for the creation and oversight of appropriate, supportive \nschool library programs. See 281 Iowa Admin. Code r. 12.3(12)(a)โ(c).  \n85.  And Iowa law required each school district to adopt policies to address the selection \nand reconsideration of school libraries. See 281 Iowa Admin. Code r. 12.3(12)(c).  \n86.  Despite  these  pre-existing  protections  for  Iowa  students,  the  2022  legislative \nsession opened with comments from Iowa State Senator Jake Chapman accusing โsomeโ teachers \nof a โsinister agendaโ to โnormalize sexually deviant behaviorโ and describing an โattack on our \nchildren [that] is no longer hidden.โ8 \n87.  Shortly thereafter, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds appeared for an interview and \nwas asked about Senator Chapmanโs comments. Governor Reynolds responded, โIf you're talking \nabout, do I think inappropriate things are being displayed in libraries, and in classrooms, across \nthe state? From what I've heard from parents, I absolutely agree with that.โ9  \n88.  During the interview, Governor Reynolds proceeded to read a passage from All \nBoys Arenโt Blue, a young adult memoir by writer and LGBTQ+ activist George M. Johnson, \ncalling it โrated Rโ and suggesting it was inappropriate to teach as part of the curriculum for K-12 \n \n8 Iowa senator criticized for comments about Iowa teachers, KCCI 8 Des Moines (updated Jan. \n11, 2022, 6:22 PM CST), https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-senator-jake-chapman-criticized-for-\ncomments-about-iowa-teachers/38739777.  \n9 James Stratton, Iowa Gov: โI donโt think thatโs appropriateโ: Context and controversy behind \nbook challenged in Iowa, KCCI, Jan. 24, 2022, https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-governor-kim-\nreynolds-context-and-controversy-behind-book-challenged-in-iowa-high-schools/38854288#.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 24 of 96\n \neducation and include in school libraries. At the time, the book was subject to challenge in certain \nschool districts. \n89.  Legislative action directed at LGBTQ+ expression in Iowa public schools became \na priority of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds for the 2023 legislative session. \n90.  On February 2, 2023, Governor Reynolds promoted legislation targeting LGBTQ+ \nstudents and their identities at a town hall meeting hosted by Moms for Liberty10 and the \nLeadership Institute.11 The meeting began with an invocation praying for strength in โthe battle \ntaking place for our childrenโs minds.โ12  \n91.  At the meeting, Governor Reynolds described her goal โto restore sanityโ through \nthe legislation, explaining there exists an โextreme and extremely loud minority,โ trying to \nโindoctrinate our children,โ that thinks โpornographic library books are education.โ13 \n92.  A week later, on February 9, 2023, Governor Reynoldsโs legislation was introduced \nin the Iowa Senate as Senate Study Bill 1145. An identical House Study Bill was introduced on \nFebruary 28, 2023.  \n \n10  The  Southern  Poverty  Law  Center  (SPLC)  describes  Moms  for  Liberty  as  โa  far-right \norganization that engages in anti-student inclusion activities and self-identifies as part of the \nmodern parental rights movement.โ SPLC, Moms for Liberty, https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-\nhate/extremist-files/group/moms-liberty (accessed Nov. 22, 2023).  According SPLC, it is an \nextremist  group  that  โopposes  LGBTQ+  and  racially  inclusive  school  curriculum,  and  has \nadvocated [for] book[] bans.โ Id.  \n11 The Leadership Institute describes its mission as โto increase the number and effectiveness of \nconservative activists and leaders in the public policy process.โ Leadership Institute, Leadership \nInstitute  Mission,  https://www.leadershipinstitute.org/aboutus/mission.cfm  (accessed  Nov.  22, \n2023).  \n12 Moms for Liberty, Giving Parents a Voice Townhall โ Iowa, at 7:54, YouTube (Feb. 2, 2023), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTdcNzHQXpw.  \n13 Id. at 19:47, 19:54, 21:14. \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 25 of 96\n \n93.  During the session, the bill emerged from House and Senate committees as Senate \nFile 496, and underwent substantial amendments and refinements, which reinforced its anti-\nLGBTQ+ priorities and goals.     \n94.  The initial bill proposed a notification and right to opt out of โany activity or \ninstruction that involves obscene material or sexually explicit material.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16; H.S.B. \n222, ยง 16.  To that end, the initial version also proposed the creation of a โcomprehensive listโ of \nany book removed by a school board of directors. S.S.B. 1145, ยงยง 1, 14; H.S.B. 222, ยงยง 1, 14. The \nbill defined those restricted materials by (a) the definition of obscenity in existing Iowa Code,14  \nand (b) a new, narrow definition of โsexually explicitโ materials.15 In order for material to be \nsexually explicit, it had to not only be โoffensiveโ and โprurient,โ but also โlack[] serious literary, \nartistic, political, or scientific value as to minors.โ16 The final bill jettisoned any reference to \nobscenity or that termโs familiar factorsโsuch as taking the work as a whole, judging it by \ncontemporary community standards, or assessing its intended appealโand abandoned the term \nโsexually explicit,โ  opting instead for the blanket prohibition of materials  that include any \nโdescription or visual depiction of a sex act.โ Any attempt to limit the scope of the all-ages ban \n \n14 See  Iowa Code ยง 728.1(5) (โany material depicting or describing the genitals, sex acts, \nmasturbation, excretory functions or sadomasochistic abuse which the average person, taking the \nmaterial as a whole and applying contemporary community standards with respect to what is \nsuitable material for minors, would find appeals to the prurient interest and is patently offensive; \nand the material, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, scientific, political or artistic valueโ). \n15 โSexually explicitโ materials were defined as material thatโ(1) [t]aken as a whole with respect \nto minor children, the material appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion,โ โ(2) \n[t]he material depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is \nsuitable for minor children, a sex act or lewd exhibition of the genitals,โ  and โ(3) [t]aken as a \nwhole, the material lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors,โ which \nwould be deemed met โif the material contains material described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) \nwhen substantially similar material is readily available to minor childrenโ without such material \nโbut that conveys a substantially similar message or viewpoint.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16. \n16 Id. \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 26 of 96\n \nwould be rejected, including the Iowa Houseโs suggestion to prohibit only โgraphic descriptionsโ \nof a sex act. Amendment H-1173 to S.F. 496, 90th Leg. Sess. Div. V ยง 10.19a(1) (as adopted by \nIA House, Apr. 4, 2023). \n95.  Moreover, the final billโs all-ages ban was expressly amended to carve-out the Bible \nfrom the billโs effect.  An Iowa Senator asked on the Senate floor whether a book containing โgang \nrape,โ โserial incest,โ and an โact of masturbationโ would meet the billโs definition of โage \nappropriate.โ The Senate sponsor correctly identified the referenced book as the Bible,17 and \nsuggested that a school board that โdecides to remove the Bible . . . might have to put up with the \nwrath of a few parents.โ  After the inquiring senator noted that existing Iowa law actually prohibits \nthe exclusion of the Bible from public schools, the bill was amended again to exclude religious \ntexts from its scope.18 SF 496 now states: โEach school district shall establish a kindergarten \nthrough grade twelve library program that is consistent with section 280.6.โ Section 280.6 of the \nIowa Code prohibits the exclusion of religious texts from schools. Amendment S-3160 to S.F. 496, \n90th Leg. Sess. Div. I ยง 9.a(1) (as adopted by IA Senate, Apr. 20, 2023).  \n96.  In the initial bill, although the term โsexual activityโ was present and had the same \ndefinition โsex actโ does in the final bill (by reference to Iowaโs criminal law), the term applied \nonly to prohibit content in K-3 instruction.19   \n \n17Senate Video  (2023-03-22), 90th  IA S. Sess.  73rd Day  at 6:35:39 PM, (Mar. 22, 2023), \nhttps://www.legis.iowa.gov/dashboard?view=video&chamber=S&clip=s20230322024547181&d\nt=2023-03-22 (quoting exchange between Sen. Quirmbach and Sen. Rozenboom); see generally \nGenesis 19:32-26, 38:8-9; Judges 19:24-29. \n18 See Iowa Code ยง 280.6 (โReligious books such as the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran shall not \nbe excluded from any public school or institution in the state . . . .โ). \n19 S.S.B. 1145, ยง 13 (prohibiting any โprogram, curriculum, material, test, survey, questionnaire, \nactivity, announcement, promotion, or instruction of any kind relating to gender identity or \nsexual activity to students in kindergarten through grade threeโ and defining โsexual activityโ as \nโthe same as defined in section 702.17โ). \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 27 of 96\n \n97.  The final billโs all-ages ban and book banning provisions expanded the prohibition \nfrom grades K-3 (about ages 5-9) to all grades K-12 (ages 5-18), and redirected the use of the term \nโsex actโ to ban library books and other materials.  \n98.  Similarly,  although  both  the  initial  bill  and  final  bill  prohibit  materials  and \ninstruction related to gender identity, that prohibition applied only to grades K-3 in the initial bill. \nAnd despite targeting gender identity from its inception, SF 496 did not expressly target sexual \norientation. Instead, the initial bill only targeted only sexual โactivityโ related to K-3 instruction. \n99.  The final billโs donโt say gay or trans provision expanded the restriction on content \nrelated to gender identity to include grades 4-6 as well. The final bill also substituted in the term \nโsexual orientationโ for โsexual activity,โ and like with gender identity, expanded the restriction \nfrom applying only to grades K-3 to applying to grades K-6.  \n100.  This legislative history shows a conflation of content concerning sexual activity \nand content related to LGBTQ+ identities and people.  By conflating the two, the final bill \nsexualizes  LGBTQ+  identities  and  people,  portraying  them  as  predatory,  inappropriate  for \ndiscussion in school, and unworthy of dignity, recognition, and respect.  SF 496 communicates \nthat LGBTQ+ children and adults are unspeakable and shameful, simply by virtue of who they are. \n101.  Finally, in the initial version of the bill, the triggering event for the forced outing \nprovision and requirement to notify a parent about their childโs gender identity was an employeeโs \nโreasonabl[e] belie[f] that the minor child has expressed a gender identity that is different than the \nbiological sex listed on the minor childโs official birth certificate.โ S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16. After the \nbillโs opponents criticized the potential reach and ambiguity in the language, the Senate sponsor \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 28 of 96\n \ncountered, โWe all know what weโre talking about here.โ20 The language was changed to trigger \nreporting on a studentโs โrequestโ for โan accommodation.โ  \n102.  The final billโs forced outing provision also was amended to remove an alternative \nreporting mechanism.  If the school determined that the notification โwas likely to lead to a case \nof child abuse,โ the school was required to report its โsafety concerns to the department of health \nand human services so that the department may determine whether the minor child is a child in \nneed of assistanceโ under Iowa law, i.e., proceedings to determine whether the child should be \nremoved from the home. S.S.B. 1145, ยง 16; see generally Iowa Code ยงยง 232.96A(1)โ(17), .102(1)โ\n(10). This apparent acknowledgment of the risks the legislation posed to children with parents or \nguardians that are not accepting or affirming of their identity ultimately was removed to ensure \nthe severe consequences of reporting fall only upon the targeted students.  \n103.  Throughout the legislative process, legislators opposing the bill spoke out on what \nthey saw as a โhatefulโ21 bill โpromoting ignorance and intolerance . . . about people who are \ndifferent than themselves.โ22 Others identified the bill as setting up โtwo tiers of kids in school: \nkids with a government approved identity or a government approved family, and kids who are \nforced to  live  in silent shadow,โ  and predicted it would lead to  โdisruption, bullying, and \nprejudice.โ23 On books, opponents saw the bill sending the โmessage that certain topics are taboo \nor shameful,โ even though โbooks that discuss sex can play a critical role in promoting empathy \nand understanding for those with different experiences and identities,โ effectively โden[ying] kids \n \n20 Senate video (2023-03-22), supra note 17, at 6:46:42 PM (quoting IA Sen.

Nevertheless, proponents maintained the bill was necessary, citing an unspecified \nโmountain of evidence that many Iowa libraries contain books that do provide sexually explicit \nand obscene pictures and narratives that many Iowa parents find objectionable.โ27 Proponents also \nclaimed that students have โcome home with books that are literally pornography.โ28 By way of \nexample,  one  Iowa  Senator  identified  Gender  Queer:  A  Memoir  by  Maia  Kobabe,  an \nautobiographical graphic novel about the authorโs journey of self-identity as a nonbinary, asexual \nperson, which the Senator described as โdisgusting.โ29  \n105.  But SF 496 does not ban only Gender Queer, whose intended audience is teenagers, \nit also bans books like Melissa by Alex Gino, which does not contain a โsex actโ and is banned \nsolely for telling the story of a transgender girl.  \n \n24 Id at 6:20:23 PM, 6:24:34 PM (quoting IA Sen.

Ultimately, however, proponents decided the bill was necessary โdue to schools \npushing wokismโ30 and because it is โwrong to push political agendas in the classroom.โ31  \n107.  On information and belief, when Governor Reynolds signed SF 496 into law, the \nGovernor reengaged the rhetoric she had expressed while promoting the bill, suggesting the law \nwas necessary to prevent the โindoctrinationโ of students with โextreme ideas,โ despite Iowaโs \nexisting laws and regulations prohibiting the distribution of obscene materials to minors and \nensuring age-appropriate instruction at school. \nSF 496 Caused Chaos and Confusion for the 2023-2024 School Year and Deprived Plaintiff \nStudents of Access to Books Based on Content and Viewpoint \n108.  Although the Governor signed SF 496 into law in May, Iowa schools had virtually \nno guidance on how to comply with the law when the 2023-2024 school year started. And the \nproposed guidance they recently have received is of little utility. Administrators, teachers, parents, \nand students are confused about how to comply with SF 496. Teachers and administrators across \nthe state have expressed panic and anxiety about how to implement the law. School districts across \nthe state have circulated and banned widely diverging lists of books and other materials from \nschool classrooms and libraries. \n109.  Many of the books that Iowa school districts have banned are books by LGBTQ+ \nauthors, such as All Boys Arenโt Blue by George M. Johnson, which chronicles the authorโs journey \ngrowing up as a queer Black man in New Jersey and Virginia.  \n \n30 House video (2023-04-04), supra note 28, at 1:57:34 PM (quoting IA Rep.

Many banned books also contain content of particular relevance to LGBTQ+ \nstudents,  including  LGBTQ+  characters,  historical  figures,  or  themes.  These  books  include \nMelissa (winner of the Stonewall Award for Childrenโs and Young Adult Literature, California \nBook Award for Juvenile (Gold), and Lambda Literary Award for Childrenโs/Young Adult)32 by \nAlex Gino; Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe; Brave Face by Shaun David Hutchinson; \nThe Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller; and This Book is Gay by Juno Dawson.  \n111.  Similarly, many banned books are by authors of color, or contain content centering \nthe narratives of Black, Brown, or Indigenous people. See, e.g., The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison; \nThe Color Purple by Alice Walker; Black Girl Unlimited by Echo Brown; Native Son by Richard \nWright; When I Was Puerto Rican by Esmeralda Santiago; Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur; and The \nAbsolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie (winner of the National Book \nAward for Young Peopleโs Literature, Odyssey Award, Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for \nFiction, and California Young Readers Medal for Young Adult).33  \n112.

After  publication  of  the  list  and  public  outcry,  Defendant  URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT reduced the number of books banned from libraries and \nclassrooms to 51, largely by assuming for the time being that the donโt say gay or trans provision \ndoes not require banning books related to gender identity or sexual orientation from school \n \nhttps://www.thegazette.com/state-government/iowa-schools-navigate-library-book-law-without-\nstate-guidance/?auth0Authentication=true.  \n35 Michael Grossberg, Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, Newspeak & memory holes: \nGeorge Orwellโs Nineteen Eighty-Four, a 1984 Prometheus Hall of fame winner for Best Fiction, \nPrometheus  Blog  (July  30,  2020),    https://www.lfs.org/blog/big-brother-truth-doublethink-\nthoughtcrime-newspeak-memory-holes-socialism-liberalism-liberty-and-tyranny-an-\nappreciation-of-george-orwells-nineteen-eighty-four-a-1984-prometheus-ha/.  \n36 The Color Purple, Goodreads, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52892857-the-color-\npurple?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=dXcyxsISvW&rank=1  (last  visited  Nov.  27, \n2023). \n37 Phillip Sitter, Urbandale schools pause removing books referencing gender identity, sexual \norientation,  Des  Moines  Register  (Aug.  4,  2023, \nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/urbandale/2023/08/03/urbandale-pauses-\nremoving-state-banned-books-with-lgbtq-references-gender-identity-iowa-book-\nban/70522886007/.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 33 of 96\n \nlibraries.38 The shortened list, however, still includes titles such as Gender Queer: A Memoir \n(winner of the ALA Alex Award)39 by Maia Kobabe; Beloved (winner of the Pulitzer Prize for \nFiction, American Book Award, Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and Frederic G.

See \nAppendix E (the list of books Defendant WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS \nidentified for removal). \n118.  Overall, โmore than 450 individual works by more than 300 authors have already \nbeen pulled from the shelves of Iowa school districts as a result of Senate File 496.โ45  \n119.  By targeting these books for removal from Iowa schools and depriving students of \naccess to these materials based on their content and viewpoint, Defendants have prevented \nmarginalized students such as LGBTQ+ young people from seeing themselves reflected in the \nstories collected in their classrooms and libraries. Plaintiff Students are denied the comfort of \nnarratives that include LGBTQ+ characters and the solace that they are not alone. \n120.

Because  Defendant  URBANDALE  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL \nDISTRICT has banned the book from school libraries and classrooms as a result of SF 496, T.S. \ncan no longer check it out from her school library. If Gender Queer: A Memoir were available, \nT.S. would check it out. As a queer person, T.S. feels that SF 496 erases her identity from public \nview.  \n121.  Plaintiff  B.F.  long  has  enjoyed  graphic  novels  and  other  fiction  containing \nLGBTQ+ representation that were available in their school library, such as Heartstopper by Alice \nOseman; Lumberjanes by Shannon Watters, Grace Ellis, Gus Allen, and ND Stevenson; Drama \nby Raina Telgemeier; and Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Me by Mariko Tamaki. B.F. was \ninsulted by the list of books that Defendant URBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT \nbanned. Several of the titles on the original list were books that were important to B.F. growing \nup because they included LGBTQ+ themes or characters. B.F. felt degraded at having their identity \nlabeled too inappropriate to even be in the school. The law and Defendant URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICTโs implementation of it caused B.F. to feel as though they \nshould be ashamed of who they are. B.F. would like to read books on the list for removal, such as \nCall Me By Your Name by Andre Aciman, and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. If they were \nnot banned, B.F. would check out the books  from the school library. Some of the books on the list \nare  even  recommended  reading  before  college.  Defendant  URBANDALE  COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICTโs implementation of SF 496 has deprived B.F. of the opportunity to obtain \nthese books in school and to work through them with other students.  \n122.  Plaintiff  B.F.S.  reviewed  the  long  list  of  books  that  Defendant  WEST  DES \nMOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS created in implementing SF 496.  B.F.S. recognized that \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 36 of 96\n \nmany of the books on the list include LGBTQ+ characters and authors, which bothered B.F.S. \nbecause they wish to read books at school that reflect their identity and experience.  \n123.  Queer literature is an important part of Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs life. He ceased feeling out \nof place in his own skin after reading Gracefully Grayson by Ami Polonsky, a story about a \ntransgender young person. Orlando by Virginia Woolf helped him realize that queer people existed \nin past generations  and that being queer does not need to be labeled the way it is today. \nHeartstopper by Alice Oseman; Good Omens (no. 68 on BBCโs top 200 best-loved novels)46 by \nTerry Pratchet and Neil Gaiman; and Red, White, and Royal Blue (winner of the ALA Alex \nAward)47 by Casey McQuiston gave him hope that one day his life could be filled with as much \nlaughter and queer joy as those characters had. These books made P.B.-P. feel safe and welcomed, \nand  he  fears  that  Defendant  WATERLOO  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICTโs \nimplementation of SF 496 will deny him access to these books he adores, in addition to queer \nliterature he has yet to read. \n124.  Plaintiff P.C. struggled with their identity growing up. At age 11, P.C. began to \nread books involving queer people, which opened up a world for them. P.C. discovered words that \nP.C. could use to understand themself and describe their own identity. Literature remains important \nto P.C.  \n125.  When P.C. was in seventh grade, they read Melissa by Alex Gino. Melissa holds \nspecial meaning for P.C. because it was the first time they had encountered a depiction of a \ntransgender child. Knowing that schools have removed Melissa frustrates P.C. because its removal \ncommunicates to transgender children such as their younger sister Plaintiff A.C. that these children \n \n46 The Big Read, BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml (last visited Nov. 2, \n2023). \n47 2020 Alex Award Winners, supra note 44. \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 37 of 96\n \nโare โinappropriateโ to exist with other children, as if their existence itself is somehow sexual or \nperverse.โ P.C. hopes their sister can read Melissa. P.C. hopes the book can remind their sister, \neven if just by sitting on a shelf, that she belongs in her school just as much as any other kid does \nand she has nothing to be ashamed of.  \n126.  Last year, a teacher loaned P.C. the book Last Night at the Telegraph Club, by \nMelinda Lo, a novel set in 1954 concerning the experience of being queer as a Chinese-American \nteenager. P.C. found it to be a โwonderful, wonderfulโ book, and cried several times while reading \nit, struck by its beautiful portrayal of sapphic relationships, gender diversity in lesbians, and \nteenage relationships. P.C. states, โIt was thoughtful and nuanced, and extremely relatable, despite \nthe different culture, place, and time. It made me feel both seen and freer to have read it.โ Because \nthe book also contains a brief sex scene, it no longer sits on their teacherโs classroom shelf. \n127.  Notably, school districts across the state have identified conflicting lists of books \nfor removal, underscoring the overbreadth and the vagueness of the law. Numerous books appear \non one or more lists but not others. For example, only 13 books appear on all three lists made \npublic  by  the  three  Defendant  School  Districts  (URBANDALE  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL \nDISTRICT, WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS, and IOWA CITY COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICT). By contrast, 90 books have been banned in one of these districts but not \nthe other two.  \n128.  Similar  discrepancies  exist  between  school  districts  statewide.  Some  school \ndistricts even have banned books considered part of the canon for students taking the AP Literature \nand Composition Exam, including As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner, Brave New World by \nAldous Huxley, and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston. Classics commonly \ntaught in curricula across the countryโsuch as Grendel by John Gardner, I Know Why the Caged \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 38 of 96\n \nBird Sings by Maya Angelou, and Animal Farm by George Orwellโalso appear on the banned \nbook lists of multiple districts, compromising studentsโ education. Novels that were taught almost \nuniversally to previous generations of Iowans already have been struck from shelves across the \nstate, and there are numerous school districts that have yet to post their banned book lists.  \nSF 496 Has Targeted LGBTQ+ Students for Erasure in Schools and Chilled Plaintiff \nStudents from Engaging in Protected Speech, Expression, and Association \n129.  Even prior to passage of SF 496, LGBTQ+ students in Iowa faced heightened \nvulnerability in the educational environment relative to their non-LGBTQ peers with respect to \nbullying, harassment, and related mental health concerns. The findings of the 2021 Youth Risk \nBehavior Survey in Iowa document that gay, lesbian, or bisexual (โGLBโ) students exhibited \nsubstantially elevated rates of school-related challenges relative to their heterosexual peers. \nNotably, 13.1% of GLB students reported not attending school because they felt unsafe, compared \nto 6.9% of their heterosexual peers. Additionally, 11.6% of GLB students reported experiencing \nthreats or injuries with weapons on school property, while the rate for their heterosexual peers was \n5.9%. There was also a significant disparity in bullying experiences, with GLB students being \ntwice as likely to experience bullying on school property or over electronic communication.  \n130.  The 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey in Iowa also demonstrates that GLB \nstudents experience significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms. A substantial 73.7% of \nGLB students reported feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more, whereas \nonly 31.3% of their heterosexual peers reported the same. Moreover, a striking 64.7% of GLB \nstudents described their mental health as most of the time or always โnot good,โ which contrasts \nstarkly with the 26.9% reported by their heterosexual peers. Most alarming, GLB students reported \nmarkedly higher rates of contemplating suicide, developing plans for self-harm, and attempting \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 39 of 96\n \nsuicide. The Iowa Health and Human Services Iowa Youth Survey 2021 Findings reflect similar \ndisparities.  \n131.  Significantly, each of these disparities is more dramatic in Iowa relative to national \nfindings, as the Trevor Projectโs National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health for 2021 \nindicates.  \n132.  The Trevor Project also reports data for transgender and nonbinary students, finding \n66% of transgender and nonbinary students in Iowa experience symptoms of depression; 76% \nexperience symptoms of anxiety; 52% seriously considered suicide in the year prior; and 22% \nactually attempted suicide. Moving forward, the Trevor Projectโs survey may be the only source \nof information on this disparity, as the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has chosen \nto withdraw from the CDCโs Youth Risk Behavior Survey (which will inquire as to studentsโ \ngender identity) in favor of its own Youth Survey (which will not).  \n133.  LGBTQ youth who found their school to be LGBTQ-affirming reported lower rates \nof suicidality and mental health concerns.48 These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted \n \n48 April Ancheta, et al., The Impact of Positive School Climate on Suicidality and Mental Health \nAmong  LGBTQ  Adolescents:  A  systematic  Review,  37  J.

Numerous \nstudies document the way in which inclusive school environments can benefit LGBTQ+ youth. A \n2019 survey, for instance, found that nearly 3 in 5 transgender students in Iowa were prevented \nfrom using names or pronouns consistent with their gender identity in school. GLSEN, School \nClimate  for  LGBTQ  Students  in  Iowa  (2019  State  Snapshot)  (2021), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/2ymx9ue2.  Strikingly,  however,  transgender  youth  whose  pronouns  are \nโrespected by all or most of the people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who \ndid not have their pronouns respected.โ The Trevor Project, 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ \nYouth Mental Health 9 (2020), https://perma.cc/MYV9-R696. Similarly, another study found that \ntransgender youth who were able to use names and pronouns corresponding to their gender identity \nexperienced a 29 percent decrease in reported thoughts of suicide and a 56 percent decrease in \nsuicidal behavior.

Russell et al., Chosen Name Use Is Linked to Reduced Depressive \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 40 of 96\n \ninterventions, support, and legal protections to create a safer and more inclusive environment for \nLGBTQ+ youth in Iowa. \n134.  SF 496 does the opposite. The donโt say gay or trans, all-ages ban, book ban, and \nforced outing provisions, particularly when taken together, render LGBTQ+ students less safe and \nundermine and obstruct efforts to support them, to reduce mental health disparities, and to enforce \nprotections against bullying and harassment. \n135.  IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS has observed the impact of SF 496 on LGBTQ+ students \nacross the state. Many students have reported feeling sad, hopeless, isolated, and frustrated that \ntheir identities are treated as โpromiscuous,โ regardless of whether they are actually sexually \nactive. Anti-LGBTQ+ bullying and harassment are on the rise. Tragically, due to the notable \nincrease in completed suicides, IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS has begun formally documenting the \nnumber of completed suicides of LGBTQ+ youth as of calendar year 2023. \n136.  On information and belief, numerous school districts, including Ames Community \nSchool District and Defendants IOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT and SIOUX \nCITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, instructed teachers to remove rainbow images, Pride \nflags, and โsafe spaceโ stickers from classrooms because of SF 496. Ames Community School \nDistrict informed school employees that they are required to report a student who speaks to them \nabout gender identityโeven if the interaction occurs outside of the school setting or typical work \nweek. \n137.  Plaintiff A.C. used to love school and could not wait to go every morning. But \nbecause of SF 496, she has become reluctant and fearful to go to school. A.C. now feels unsafe \n \nSymptoms, Suicidal Ideation, and Suicidal Behavior Among Transgender Youth, 63 J. Adolescent \nHealth 503 (2018). \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 41 of 96\n \nand as if she is being watched. A.C. is aware, even at her young age, that teachers whom she once \ntrusted are now not permitted to be sources of support to her, because of the law. A.C. is hurt, \nstressed, and upset as a result. The law sends A.C. the message that there is something wrong with \nher, and that she should be silenced and erased from school. \n138.  SF 496 has heightened Plaintiff P.B.-P.โs fear of violence and harassment in school, \nand he knows his fears are shared by other LGBTQ+ students. Such fears are reasonable given his \npast experiences of bullying and harassment in Waterloo schools. For example, in 9th grade, P.B.-\nP. participated in a school play. While he was on stage, delivering a monologue, a middle school \nstudent, goaded on by others, shouted that he was going to shoot P.B.-P., identifying him by name. \nThe school reported the threat to the police, but no action was taken by the police to P.B.-P.โs \nknowledge. P.B.-P. assumed that the student threatened him this way because of P.B.-P.โs support \nfor transgender rights. This experience changed the way he navigates the world, leaving him \nanxious, and concerned that he currently attends school with the person who threatened his life. \nP.B.-P. is frequently harassed by classmates who yell anti-LGBTQ+ slurs at him and his friends \nunprovoked. Especially after SF 496, he feels as though he has a target on his back because SF \n496 gives confidence to those who believe something is wrong with him because he is transgender, \nsince the law itself reflects that belief.  \n139.  SF 496 stigmatizes and silences P.B.-P., chilling him from engaging in protected \nspeech acknowledging who he is and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community. Despite the \nbullying and harassment P.B.-P. experienced, he used to feel more comfortable wearing clothing \nor buttons in school with the Pride rainbow flag or other indicators that he is a member of the \nLGBTQ+ community. After passage of SF 496, however, his worries about being a target have \nreached a new high, and he now self-censors such expression.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 42 of 96\n \n140.  P.B.-P. used to refer to his identity as transgender in class or related schoolwork \nwhen it was relevant, such as in essays on self-reflection, overcoming personal challenges, what \nhe would say to his younger self, and what it means to be American. Now that SF 496 has been \nenacted, he self-censors such references out of concerns for his own safety and fear that mentioning \nhis identity as transgender will get his teachers in trouble. Rather than correct peers and teachers \nwho use incorrect pronouns to refer to him, P.B.-P. now self-censors because he fears discipline \nand does not want to get a teacher in trouble during class for correcting his own pronouns. \n141.  SF 496 also chills P.B.-P. from engaging in speech protesting anti-LGBTQ+ \nlegislation affecting Iowa students. As a member of his schoolโs GSA during his freshman year, \nhe led a protest against such measures, gathering outside of the school. After SF 496 was passed, \nP.B.-P. feels terrified of staging another protest. The law has caused anti-LGBTQ sentiment to \nincrease at his school, and students fear punishment from school officials for participating in such \na protest. \n142.  Plaintiff T.S. similarly self-censors references to her identity in class, trying never \nto mention that she is a lesbian because she fears that teachers will react poorly and crack down \non students as a result of SF 496. T.S. has experienced bullying in the past targeting her identity \nas a lesbian. She was called names, slurs, mocked, pushed to the ground, shoved into a locker, and \nbullied so harshly in science class that she repeatedly felt forced to go to a counselorโs room instead \nof to class. She filled out at least 50 incident report sheets over the course of one year. She fears \nincreased bullying as a result of SF 496. \n143.  SF 496 causes Plaintiff B.F. to feel unwanted, shameful, and unwelcome in school. \nIt interferes with B.F.โs relationship with teachers because B.F. self-censors mention of their \ngender identity and pronouns even to supportive teachers for fear of getting a teacher fired, and \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 43 of 96\n \nfor fear of harassment by other students who now feel encouraged to bully LGBTQ+ students as a \nresult of the law. In the past, fellow students have harassed B.F., calling them slurs, a slut, and \ntelling them to kill themself. Since SF 496 was passed, the harassment has become worse, making \nB.F. feel uncomfortable and less safe at school. \n144.  The law has caused Plaintiff B.F.S. to feel as though they have a target on their \nback at school. B.F.S. already has experienced bullying in school this year for expressing their \nLGBTQ+  identity,  including  on  โCulture  Day,โ  when  students  were  invited  to  wear  flags \ncelebrating diverse cultures. Because B.F.S. wore rainbow socks and a Pride flag, another student \nyelled, โJesus hates you! Youโre going to hell!โ SF 496 sends the message to B.F.S. that students \ncan expect this kind of targeted harassment if they express themselves as LGBTQ+. B.F.S. now \nthinks twice before wearing a Pride shirt, button, or anything else that expresses their identity and \nfeels less safe at school. \n145.  SF 496 causes Plaintiff ROBERT SMITH to fear for his friends who used to feel \nsafe being themselves only at school, because they do not have supportive homes and do not wish \nto be outed to their parents by school officials. Stilwell Junior High School no longer feels like a \nsafe space for SMITH and his friends. Some teachers who used to talk about LGBTQ issues no \nlonger do. Some teachers took down their safe-space stickers. SF 496 โtakes away safe people and \nsafe spacesโ from LGBTQ+ students, and SMITH fears that the emotional and mental health toll \nof the law will be so great for some of these students that โthey may not make it through.โ \n146.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE is aware of other students who have been bullied based on \ntheir LGBTQ+ identities but fear telling teachers about the bullying because they do not wish to \nbe outed to their parents. DOE and other students are hesitant to bring up queer themes and topics \nin classes and outside of class in school for fear of getting teachers in trouble.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 44 of 96\n \n147.   SF  496  also  chills  students  from  associating  for  the  purpose  of  expressing \nthemselves, advocating for equality for LGBTQ+ students, and providing mutual support and \ncommunity.  \n148.  The law has caused school districts across the state to restrict the activities of \nmember GSAs within the IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโs GSA network and has forced some member \nGSAs to close altogether.  \n149.  School districts have prohibited GSAs from displaying signs or promoting the club \nin classrooms or hallways where students younger than seventh graders may be present, even in \nschools that include eighth or ninth graders, and even though other noncurricular clubs are not \nsubject to the same restrictions. For example, an advisor for a member GSA in the College \nCommunity School District informed an IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS staff person, โWith us being a \n5th/6th building, we will not be able to run our GSA this year due to the new legislation,โ referring \nto SF 496โs ban on programming, promotion, or instruction relating to sexual orientation or gender \nidentity in kindergarten through grade six.  \n150.  Other GSA advisors have pointed to the lawโs forced outing provision as the cause \nof restrictions and/or closure of GSAs. Students and faculty members alike are confused about \nwhat speech during a GSA meeting could trigger a report home or whether merely attending a \nmeeting is sufficient. Faculty members who previously sponsored student-led GSA chapters now \nare reluctant to do so for fear of being required to out student members as a result of the law, \nforcing these chapter members of IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS to close. \n151.  Before the passage of SF 496, Plaintiff A.C. attended meetings of the GSA at her \nschool as a third grader. The purpose of these meetings was to build community among the \nLGBTQ+ students at the school. This year, as a result of SF 496, Defendant IOWA CITY \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 45 of 96\n \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT ceased GSAs for kindergarten through sixth grades. A.C. \nand other LGBTQ+ students at her school have not been able to attend a meeting of the GSA this \nyear.  \n152.  SF 496 has caused the number of members of the Waterloo West High School GSA \nto dwindle this year, as students now fear being outed to unsupportive family members and \nincreased bullying and harassment from peers. Waterloo West High Schoolโs GSA is a happy \nspace that should be accessible to all interested LGBTQ+ students, but SF 496 interferes with \nstudentsโ ability to create a supportive community for each other. \n153.  Plaintiff ROBERT SMITH was active in Stilwell Junior High Schoolโs GSA last \nyear and looked forward to GSA meetings this year. The GSA served as a support for him and \nother LGBTQ+ students. After SF 496, some of ROBERT SMITHโs peers would not join the GSA \nfor fear of being outed to unsupportive family members. Worse, ROBERT SMITH recently \nlearned that, as a result of SF 496, the schoolโs GSA has ceased altogether. As in other schools \nafter SF 496, ROBERT SMITHโS GSA could not find a willing teacher to serve as sponsor this \nyear.  \n154.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE is active in his schoolโs GSA and knows fellow students who \nwould like to join the GSA but will not because they are afraid of facing hostility at home if they \nare outed by SF 496โs requirements. LGBTQ+ studentsโ reluctance to join the GSA diminishes \nDOEโs own experience of community in the GSA. DOE also knows students who are afraid to use \nthe name and pronoun that match their gender identities, because SF 496 will cause school officials \nto out these students to unsupportive parents, and they will face negative consequences at home. \nDOE feels that SF 496 has created a climate of fear that prevents students from coming together \nto support each other and express a common message of pride in who they are. \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 46 of 96\n \n155.  Worst of all, SF 496 also deprives LGBTQ+ young people in kindergarten through \nsixth grade of any sense of safety or security. P.C. sums up the impact on their 9-year-old sister \nA.C. as follows:  \nMy little sister is a lot younger than meโseven to eight years, depending \non what time of the year it is. It was New Years when she was born, and I \nremember holding her, and thinking that she was so small that she didnโt \nlook  real.  Her  presence  contextualized  all  of  my  difficulties,  my \ndisappointments, my mistakesโI was there to pave the way, so she didnโt \nstumble on the same cracks that I did. I donโt know how well I did, in that \nregard, but I certainly tried as hard as I could. Sheโs my little sister, after all. \nIsnโt the natural instinct just to swoop them up and protect them from \neverything that could hurt?  \n \nIn the end, thatโs what hits me the hardest about [SF 496]. Literature paved \nthe way for me, and I was meant to be paving the way for herโbut how can \nI do that without the books? How can I look my little sister in the eye and \ntell her not to worry, when the school systems sheโs in want to eliminate her \nexistence from every library, every curriculum? How can I promise that Iโll \nkeep her safe against something I canโt stop? Because itโs not just about \nwhat the children are learning. Itโs about safety. When my sister sees a \nrainbow in a classroom, it shows her that she is safe there. It says that that \nroom contains people who will not harass or harm her for something she \ncannot change.  \n \nSF 496 hasnโt been easy for my little sister. I see how sheโs more and more \nworried about going to school, how she conceals herself instead of taking \npride in who she is. No longer can she tell if someone is safe, because they \narenโt allowed to advertise thatโand it means she has to treat everyone as \nunsafe, by default. It is heartbreaking to watch her be made to feel alone, \nsilenced, and less than at school, and to know that the state we have lived in \nfor our entire lives supports that.  \n \nCOUNT I \nContent and Viewpoint Based Discrimination in Violation of First Amendment  \nRight to Receive Information \n156.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein by this \nreference.  \n157.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Defendants \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; JARED SMITH, in his official capacity as \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 47 of 96\n \nWaterloo  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  SUE  FLYNN,  JESSE  KNIGHT, \nASTOR  WILLIAMS,  LYLE  SCHMITT,  STACIE  MILLS,  JANELLE  EWING,  PAM \nARNDORFER, and JEFF SOMMERFELDT, in their official capacities as board members of the \nWaterloo Community School District. \n158.   Plaintiffs P.C. and A.C. state this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nIOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; MATT DEGNER, in his official capacity as \nIowa  City  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  MOLLY  ABRAHAM,  J.P. \nCLAUSSEN, CHARLIE EASTHAM, JAYNE FINCH, RUTHINA MALONE, MITCH LINGO, \nand LISA WILLIAMS, in their official capacities as board members of the Iowa City Community \nSchool District. \n159.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants, and Defendants \nURBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROSALIE DACA, in her official capacity \nas  Urbandale  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  KATHERINE  HOWSARE,  \nRACHEL KENT, JENNY MEADE, JASON MENKE, JULIE MITCHELL, STEVE RICHMAN, \nJOSH VAN RYSWYK, CARISSA WILLIAMS, and MARGARET YOUNG in their official \ncapacities as board members of the Urbandale Community School District. \n160.  Plaintiffs B.F.S. and ROBERT SMITH state this claim against State Defendants \nand Defendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his \nofficial capacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, \nMICHAEL ANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE \nELLIOTT, JILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as \nboard members of the West Des Moines Community Schools District.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 48 of 96\n \n161.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nSIOUX  CITY  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT;  ROD  EARLEYWINE,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Sioux City Community School District Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, \nLANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, \nand EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community \nSchool District. \n162.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law. \n163.  The First Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment \nand enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides in part that the government โshall make \nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.โ \n164.  SF 496 on its face and as implemented by Defendants perpetrates content-based \ndiscrimination  and  is  a  faรงade  for  viewpoint-based  discrimination  and  therefore  is  facially \nunconstitutional under the First Amendment.  \n165.  The book ban provisions of SF 496 on their face and as implemented by Defendants \ncensor materials addressing gender identity and sexual orientation and containing messages of \ninclusion, affirmation, and support with respect to studentsโ LGBTQ+ sexual orientation and \ngender identity based on content and viewpoint and therefore are unconstitutional on their face \nand as applied to Plaintiffs under the First Amendment.  \n166.  Students at Iowaโs public schools have the right under the First Amendment as \napplied to the State of Iowa by the Fourteenth Amendment to receive information and ideas.  \n167.  Once the State creates a library, any action to regulate that library necessarily \ninvokes the First Amendmentโs concerns and protections. \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 49 of 96\n \n168.  A studentโs constitutional right to receive information is violated when library \nmaterials are removed for a purpose not reasonably related to a legitimate pedagogical concern. \nStudents also have a right under the First Amendment to be free from official conduct in schoolโ\nsuch as removal of books from school librariesโthat is intended to suppress ideas based on \ndisapproval of their content. \n169.  Studentsโ right to receive information and ideas includes the right to access and \nread the books available in the school library, a non-curricular space for voluntary, self-led access \nto materials that is entitled to unique protection in the school environment under the U.S. \nConstitution.  \n170.  The book ban provisions require the removal and exclusion of โany material with \ndescriptions or visual depictions of a sex actโ from all Iowa school libraries and the removal of \nmaterials relating to gender identity or sexual orientation from school libraries in a school with \nkindergarten through sixth grades. SF 496 thus on its face impermissibly infringes upon studentsโ \nright to receive information and ideas from books at the school library based upon the content of \nthese books, the message they mean to convey, and the ideas and subject matter expressed therein.   \n171.  In its purpose and effect, SF 496 is an impermissible infringement upon studentsโ \nright to receive information and ideas from books in the school library based upon the views \nexpressed therein in that it was enacted with the intent to and has been applied to remove books \nby LGBTQ+ authors expressing messages of inclusion, affirmation, and support for LGBTQ+ \nstudents and persons, as the legislative history, implementation, and impact of SF 496 reveals.  \n172.  On its face, SF 496 is an impermissible infringement upon studentsโ right to receive \ninformation and ideas from books at the school library based upon the views expressed in that it \npermits materials containing descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act if those materials are \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 50 of 96\n \nโ[r]eligious books such as the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran,โ while mandating the removal and \nexclusion of all other materials with the same description or visual depiction of a sex act.  \n173.  โ[M]aterial with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex actโ and materials \nโrelating to gender identity or sexual orientationโ are not unprotected speech in and of themselves. \nPrior to SF 496, Iowa laws already protected minors from obscene materials, ensured schools \nmaintained effective school library programs, and provided for local control over school library \nmaterials.  \n174.  On its face, in its intent, purpose, and effect, SF 496 attempts to prescribe what shall \nbe orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion in Iowa schools, such as \nby censoring messages of inclusion, affirmation, and support of LGBTQ+ students and persons, \nwithout any legitimate pedagogical reason. The billโs proponents made that much clear when they \nannounced their intent to combat โwokism,โ49 a โsinister agendaโ50 and โdisgustingโ51 โnarratives \nthat many Iowa parents find objectionable.โ52  \n175.  SF 496, on in its face and as applied to Plaintiffs, is a content- and viewpoint-based \nregulation that is not justified by a compelling government interest or narrowly tailored to achieve \nany arguable interest and as such violates Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights on its face and as \napplied.  \n176.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief from the Defendants to remedy the \ndeprivations suffered as a result of the violations of their First Amendment rights.  \n \n49 House video (2023-04-04), supra note 10, at 1:57:34 PM (quoting IA Rep.

Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief that SF 496 is unconstitutional and \nunenforceable in that it requires the removal and exclusion of materials from a school library solely \non the basis they contain a description or visual depiction of a sex act or relate to gender identity \nor sexual orientation.  \n178.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496 by removing and excluding materials from school libraries solely on the \nbasis they contain a description or visual depiction of a sex act or relate to gender identity or sexual \norientation, investigating school districts or employees of school districts for potential violations \nof SF 496 related to library programs, or subjecting superintendents or employees of school \ndistricts to hearings that may result in disciplinary action because of a violation of SF 496. \nPlaintiffs further request that this Court order Defendant School Districts to restore any materials \nalready removed from their respective library programs in implementing SF 496. Plaintiffs will \nsuffer irreparable injury and will continue to suffer real and immediate threat of irreparable injury \nas a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement \nof SF 496. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. \nCOUNT II \nDeprivation of Freedom of Speech and Expression in Violation of First Amendment \n179.   Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein by this \nreference. \n180.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS states this claim against State Defendants. \n181.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Defendants \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; JARED SMITH, in his official capacity as \nWaterloo  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  SUE  FLYNN,  JESSE  KNIGHT, \nASTOR  WILLIAMS,  LYLE  SCHMITT,  STACIE  MILLS,  JANELLE  EWING,  PAM \n51 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 52 of 96\n \nARNDORFER, and JEFF SOMMERFELDT, in their official capacities as board members of the \nWaterloo Community School District.  \n182.  Plaintiffs P.C. and A.C. state this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nIOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; MATT DEGNER, in his official capacity as \nIowa  City  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  MOLLY  ABRAHAM,  J.P. \nCLAUSSEN, CHARLIE EASTHAM, JAYNE FINCH, RUTHINA MALONE, MITCH LINGO, \nand LISA WILLIAMS, in their official capacities as board members of the Iowa City Community \nSchool District. \n183.  Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants, and Defendants \nURBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROSALIE DACA, in her official capacity \nas  Urbandale  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  KATHERINE  HOWSARE, \nRACHEL KENT, JENNY MEADE, JASON MENKE, JULIE MITCHELL, STEVE RICHMAN, \nJOSH VAN RYSWYK, CARISSA WILLIAMS, and MARGARET YOUNG, in their official \ncapacities as board members of the Urbandale Community School District. \n184.  Plaintiffs B.F.S. and ROBERT SMITH state this claim against State Defendants \nand Defendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his \nofficial capacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, \nMICHAEL ANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE \nELLIOTT, JILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as \nboard members of the West Des Moines Community Schools District.   \n185.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nSIOUX  CITY  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT;  ROD  EARLEYWINE,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Sioux City Community School District Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, \n52 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 53 of 96\n \nLANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, \nand EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community \nSchool District. \n186.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law. \n187.  The  First  Amendment,  applicable  to  the  State  of  Iowa  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, provides in part that the government โshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom \nof speech.โ  \n188.  Discrimination against speech based on its content and viewpoint is a violation of \nthe First Amendment. Efforts to suppress speech based on the governmentโs opposition to the \nspeakerโs views or beliefs are unconstitutional absent narrow tailoring in service of a compelling \njustification. \n189.  On its face and as the legislative history shows, SF 496 is a faรงade for content and \nviewpoint discrimination. By design, the donโt say gay or trans provision, the all-ages ban, the \nbook ban provisions, and the forced outing provisions of SF 496 are meant to suppress speech on \nthe basis of viewpoint and content. SF 496 is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment. \n190.  SF 496 impermissibly chills the exercise of all Plaintiff Studentsโ constitutionally \nprotected speech based on the content and viewpoint of their speech and is unconstitutional as \napplied to Plaintiffs under the First Amendment. \n191.  Defendant School Districts have implemented and unless enjoined will continue to \nimplement SF 496 in a way that explicitly censors messages of inclusion, affirmation, and support \nwith  respect  to  studentsโ  LGBTQ+  orientation  or  gender  identity.  SF  496  therefore  is \nunconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs under the First Amendment.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 54 of 96\n \n192.  The  First  Amendment  guarantees  Iowa  students  the  right  to  speak,  express \nthemselves, and associate with other like-minded students, including in schools. These rights  \ninclude the right to speak about and express their own gender identity or sexual orientation, to \naffirm their friendsโ or loved onesโ gender identity or sexual orientation, to ask questions of their \nteachers and trusted school staff members about gender identity and sexual orientation, to organize \ninto or join GSAs, to wear clothing consistent with their gender or that otherwise indicates that \nthey are members of the LGBTQ+ community, and to otherwise engage in conduct expressing \nmessages of inclusion, affirmation, and support for LGBTQ+ students and persons.  \n193.  Speech and expression โrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation,โ such as \ncoming-out speech, is protected First Amendment activity.  \n194.  SF 496 on its face and the manner in which the Defendants are implementing it \nimpermissibly chills Plaintiffsโ and other studentsโ speech and expression and causes them to self-\ncensor. The donโt say gay or trans provision on its face, in its intent and purpose, as applied, and \nin effect impermissibly infringes upon studentsโ expressive rights based upon the content of the \nexpression,  the  message  they  mean  to  convey,  and  the  ideas  and  subject  matter  expressed \nindividually or as groups associated for that purpose, and on its face, infringes upon said rights \nbased upon the viewpoint of the speaker.  \n195.  The donโt say gay or trans provision, the all-ages ban, the book ban provisions, and \nthe forced outing provisions taken together chill student speech and expression related to sexual \norientation and gender identity at all grade levels. By prohibiting speech related to gender identity \nor sexual orientation in kindergarten through sixth grade; requiring that educational programming \nfor all grades, including all activities in and outside of the classroom, exclude descriptions of sex \nacts; banning books from classrooms and libraries; mandating the outing of students to parents or \n54 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 55 of 96\n \nguardians regardless of whether doing so would put the student at risk; inviting anonymous \ncomplaints by parents; and enforcing the law via draconian penalties including the potential loss \nof licensure for school employees and loss of accreditation for schools, the law communicates to \nall LGBTQ+ students that they should remain silent.   \n196.  SF 496 is not narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest.  \n197.  As  a  content-  and  viewpoint-based  regulation  that  is  neither  justified  by  a \ncompelling government interest nor narrowly tailored to achieve any arguable interest, SF 496 \nviolates studentsโ First Amendment rights.  \n198.  On its face and in its intent, purpose, and effect, SF 496 attempts to prescribe what \nshall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, such as the \ninclusion, affirmation, and support of LGBTQ+ students and persons, and thus violates studentsโ \nFirst Amendment rights.  \n199.  On its face and in its intent, purpose, and effect, SF 496 infringes upon studentsโ \nexpressive rights without any reasonable relation to legitimate pedagogical concerns and is thus \nunconstitutional.  \n200.  In the past, Plaintiff Students have engaged in protected speech and expression \nconcerning their own or othersโ sexual orientation and gender identity in school contexts and with \nother students. They wish to continue to do so. However, because of SF 496, these Plaintiffs have \nbeen chilled and/or forced to self-censor by taking care not to mention their own sexual orientation \nand/or gender identity, or otherwise engaging in related speech and expression in school contexts \nwhen they otherwise would do so.  \n201.  Furthermore,  SF  496  chills  and  precludes  teachers  and  school  officials  from \nanswering studentsโ questions about the sexual orientation, family structure, and/or gender identity \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 56 of 96\n \nof Plaintiff Students in the same way that teachers and school officials would answer questions \nabout non-LGBTQ+ students or their families. SF 496 chills and precludes teachers and school \nofficials from intervening to explain that these Plaintiffs and their families are as worthy as any \nothers and that LGBTQ+ students are not inherently vulgar, promiscuous, or obscene. SF 496 \nreinforces dangerous and harmful beliefs that Plaintiff Students are shameful or โinappropriateโ \nfor discussion in a school context, but that cisgender and straight children and families are not. SF \n496 further chills and precludes teachers and school officials from protecting Plaintiff Students \nfrom stigma and bullying as a result of their sexual orientation and gender. \n202.  Plaintiffsโ speech is presently being chilled even before enforcement of SF 496 \nstarts and it will continue to be affected as Defendants and their agents seek to enforce the law.  \nSF 496 objectively chills protected expression. Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief from the \nDefendants  to  remedy  the  deprivations  suffered  as  a  result  of  the  violations  of  their  First \nAmendment rights.  \n203.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief that SF 496 is unconstitutional and \nunenforceable.  \n204.

MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE ELLIOTT, \nJILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as board \nmembers of the West Des Moines Community Schools District.   \n210.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nSIOUX  CITY  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT;  ROD  EARLEYWINE,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Sioux City Community School District Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, \nLANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, \n58 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 59 of 96\n \nand EARL MILLER,, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community \nSchool District.   \n211.  Plaintiffs A.C., P.B.-P., ROBERT SMITH, and JAMES DOE are referred to \ncollectively as the Plaintiff Student GSA members.  \n212.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law. \n213.  The  First  Amendment,  applicable  to  the  State  of  Iowa  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, provides in part that the government โshall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right \nof the people peaceably to assemble.โ  \n214.  On its face and as applied, the donโt say gay or trans provision, the all-ages ban, \nand the forced outing provision of SF 496 violate the rights of Plaintiff Student GSA members, \nmembers of Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA network, and other students to freedom of \nexpressive association under the First Amendment to the Constitution.   \n215.  Defendants have abridged and are continuing to abridge the right to expression and \nfreedom of expressive association of Plaintiff Student GSA members, members of Plaintiff IOWA \nSAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA network, and other students. \n216.  Defendants have created and maintain a limited public forum for student expression \nand association from which they have excluded Plaintiff Student GSA members and other students \nnot before the Court from access on terms equal to others in a manner that constitutes viewpoint \ndiscrimination and that was and is unreasonable in light of the purposes the forum serves. \n217.  Defendants have discriminated and are continuing to discriminate against Plaintiff \nStudent GSA members, members of Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA network, and other \nstudents based upon the viewpoint and content of their expression and expressive association. \n59 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 60 of 96\n \n218.  By restricting the ability of Plaintiff Student GSA members, members of Plaintiff \nIOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA network, and other students to express themselves and associate \nwith others in student groups on equal terms to other student groups, Defendants have prohibited \nand unless enjoined will continue to prohibit Plaintiff Student GSA members and other students \nnot before the Court from enjoying the support, inclusion, and affirmation such groups provide, \ncausing irreparable harm.   \n219.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496 to prohibit students from becoming members of GSAs or attending GSA \nmeetings and events or to prohibit GSAs from advertising or promoting their group, or to otherwise \ninterfere with the lawful conduct of the GSAs. Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will \ncontinue to suffer real and immediate threat of irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result \nof the existence, operation, enforcement, and threat of enforcement of SF 496. Plaintiffs have no \nplain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. \nCOUNT IV \nVoid for Vagueness under First and Fourteenth Amendment \n220.

Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Defendants \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; JARED SMITH, in his official capacity as \nWaterloo  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  SUE  FLYNN,  JESSE  KNIGHT, \nASTOR  WILLIAMS,  LYLE  SCHMITT,  STACIE  MILLS,  JANELLE  EWING,  PAM \nARNDORFER, and JEFF SOMMERFELDT, in their official capacities as board members of the \nWaterloo Community School District.  \n60 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 61 of 96\n \n223.   Plaintiffs P.C. and A.C. state this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nIOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; MATT DEGNER, in his official capacity as \nIowa  City  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  MOLLY  ABRAHAM,  J.P. \nCLAUSSEN, CHARLIE EASTHAM, JAYNE FINCH, RUTHINA MALONE, MITCH LINGO, \nand LISA WILLIAMS, in their official capacities as board members of the Iowa City Community \nSchool District. \n224.  T.S.  and  B.F.  state  this  claim  against  State  Defendants,  and  Defendants \nURBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROSALIE DACA, in her official capacity \nas  Urbandale  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  KATHERINE  HOWSARE, \nRACHEL KENT, JENNY MEADE, JASON MENKE, JULIE MITCHELL, STEVE RICHMAN, \nJOSH VAN RYSWYK, CARISSA WILLIAMS, and MARGARET YOUNG, in their official \ncapacities as board members of the Urbandale Community School District  \n225.  B.F.S.  and  ROBERT  SMITH  state  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and \nDefendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his official \ncapacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, MICHAEL \nANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE ELLIOTT, \nJILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as board \nmembers of the West Des Moines Community Schools District.   \n226.  JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants SIOUX \nCITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROD EARLEYWINE, in his official capacity as \nSioux  City  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  DAN  GREENWELL,  LANCE \nEHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, and EARL \n61 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 62 of 96\n \nMILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community School \nDistrict. \n227.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law.  \n228.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. section 1983, provides that, โ[no] state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law.โ \n229.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, a governmental enactment like SF 496 is \nunconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what \nis prohibited, or if it is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory \nenforcement. In other words, governmental enactments are unconstitutionally void for vagueness \nwhen their prohibitions are not clearly defined. A more stringent test applies when a law implicates \nthe exercise of freedom of speech or association. \n230.  SF 496 is void for vagueness in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment both on its \nface and as applied to specific forms of expression in which Plaintiff Students wish to engage.  \n231.  The donโt say gay or trans provision, the all-ages ban, the book ban provisions, and \nthe forced outing provision of SF 496 prohibit certain categories of speech and require the removal \nof  books  and materials from  all  Iowa school  library programs,  classrooms, and outside of \nclassrooms.  \n232.  SF 496 also includes the threat of disciplinary sanction up to and including the loss \nof accreditation and licensure.  \n233.  SF 496โs definition of โage-appropriateโ as not including โany material with \ndescriptions or visual depictions of a sex act as defined in section 702.17โ speaks in terms so vague \nas to fail to provide adequate notice of what material is prohibited. Although section 702.17 defines \n62 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 63 of 96\n \nโsex actโ by a six-point list of types of sexual activity, the level of specificity or explicitness of the \nโvisual depictionโ of such acts is not clarified. This ambiguity is particularly problematic given \nthe medium proscribed: books and the infinite variety of expression that form allows. The \nlegislative history, conflicting statements of state legislators about the lawโs meaning during and \npost-enactment, and the absence of any guidance or rulemaking from State Defendants underscores \nthe vagueness and ambiguity of the law.  \n234.  By failing to provide clear boundaries on the materials prohibited from educational \nand library programs, SF 496 invites and has resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \nFor example, Defendant School Districts and other school districts in the State of Iowa have \ncirculated a diverging array of โbanned book listsโ for removal, evidencing little understanding of \nor agreement on meaning of the prohibition, with one school district even resorting to using an \nartificial intelligence chatbot for guidance. Others have attempted to compile lists from other \njurisdictions with different restrictive laws or, on information and belief, from lists that anti-\nLGBTQ+ and antigovernment extremist groups have propounded.  \n235.  The donโt say gay or trans provision, which prohibits โany program, curriculum, \ntest,  survey,  questionnaire,  promotion,  or  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual \norientation,โ likewise speaks in terms so vague as to fail to provide adequate notice of what speech \nis  prohibited.  For  example,  the  terms,  โprogram,  curriculum,  test,  survey,  questionnaire, \npromotion, or instructionโ are not defined under Iowa statutes, and Iowa regulations define only \nโeducational programโ and โcurriculum.โ Taken together, the seven separate prohibited speech \ntypes would encompass all activities within a school.  \n236.  โ[G]ender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ are defined so broadly as to encompass \nany gender identity and sexual orientation, including cisgender identities and heterosexuality. In \n63 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 64 of 96\n \naddition, the phrase โrelating toโ contains no limitation of intent or import.  Taken together, merely \nacknowledging a real or fictional personโs gender or marital status would appear to violate the law. \nThe legislative history of SF 496, conflicting statements of state legislators about its meaning \nduring  and  post-enactment,  and  the  ambiguous  rulemaking  from  State  Defendants  further \ncompounds the vagueness of the law. \n237.  By failing to provide clear boundaries on the speech prohibited in kindergarten \nthrough sixth grade settings through the donโt say gay or trans provision, SF 496 also invites and \nhas resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. For example, the donโt say gay or trans \nprovision  prohibits  discussion  of  topics  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  in \nkindergarten through sixth grade.  SF 496, however, is vague as to whether the provision requires \nremoval of materials relating to gender identity or sexual orientation from school libraries where \nthe schools include kindergarten through sixth grade.  \n238.  In addition, in Iowa schools, sixth grade may be part of middle schools or junior \nhigh schools, and some school districts do not maintain separate elementary and secondary school \nlibraries. SF 496 is vague as to whether Defendant School Districts and other school districts in \nthe State of Iowa are required to apply the donโt say gay or trans provision to grades above sixth.   \n239.  The forced outing provision, which requires licensed practitioners to report any \nstudentโs โrequestโ for โan accommodation that is intended to affirm the studentโs gender identity \n. . . including a request that the licensed practitioner address the student using a name or pronoun \nthat is different than the name or pronoun assigned to the student in the school districtโs registration \nforms or records,โ likewise speaks in terms so vague as to fail to provide adequate notice of what \nspeech is prohibited. For example, neither a โrequestโ nor an โaccommodationโ have defined \nmeanings under Iowa statutes. While an โaccommodationโ in the context of education may \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 65 of 96\n \nordinarily be understood to encompass those obligations required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws, such a meaning is inconsistent with the forced outing provisionโs broad \nscope. Further, โgender identityโ includes all gender identities, regardless of the studentโs sex \nassigned at birth, including cisgender identities, such that the forced outing provision is vague as \nto what โaccommodationsโ might โaffirmโ a studentโs gender identity. \n240.  Defendant School Districts and other school districts in the State of Iowa have \nalready begun enforcing SF 496 in violation of studentsโ constitutional rights by removing books \nfrom classrooms and libraries based on content and viewpoint in violation of Plaintiff Studentsโ \nand other studentsโ right to receive information; restricting the activities of GSAs in violation of \nthe right of expressive association of Plaintiff Student GSA members; members of IOWA SAFE \nSCHOOLSโs GSA network, and other students; and prohibiting messages of inclusion with respect \nto sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as threatening to or actually reporting studentsโ \nexpressions of gender identity regardless of these studentsโ wishes, thus chilling student speech \nand expression protected under the First Amendment.  \n241.  SF 496 impermissibly delegates standardless discretionary power to Defendants for \nresolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis. \n242.  Vague prohibitions inhibit freedom of speech when individuals do not know \nwhether  their  speech  is  permitted  and  choose  not  to  exercise  their  rights  for  fear  of  the \nconsequences. \n243.  Plaintiff Students do not know which of their activities, speech, or expression are \nprohibited by SF 496 and are justifiably fearful of engaging in any speech or conduct that \nDefendant School Districts could penalize. Plaintiff Students self-censor as a result.  \n65 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 66 of 96\n \n244.  SF 496 includes vague and subjective terms that lend themselves to conflicting or \nunclear interpretations and fails to provide adequate notice as to which information, concepts, \nspeech, and expression may or may not be discussed or allowed in school settings by Plaintiff \nStudents,  including  in  extracurricular  student  groups  or  school  libraries.  Despite  SF  496โs \nvagueness, it includes a range of penalties for schools and employees who fail to comply and \nmandates an anonymous complaint procedure to report alleged noncompliance. Plaintiffs are \njustifiably fearful of engaging in any speech or conduct that could be considered a violation of SF \n496, or result in complaints or penalties for school employees. These potential penalties for schools \nand employees have further prompted Defendant School Districts and other school districts to \nproactively  and  haphazardly  remove  materials,  prohibit  speech,  and  restrict  student  group \nactivities, causing Plaintiff Students and other students not before the Court to self-censor to avoid \nconsequence to themselves, their teachers, and their schools, and to lose access to materials, \nsupport, and instruction they would otherwise access and benefit from if available.  \n245.  SF 496 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is void \nfor vagueness because it infringes on all Plaintiffsโ constitutionally protected right to free speech \nand provides inadequate notice of the conduct it purports to prohibit. \n246.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief from the Defendants to remedy the \ndeprivations suffered as a result of the violations of their First Amendment rights.  \n247.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief that SF 496 is unconstitutional and \nunenforceable in that it fails to provide adequate notice as to which information, concepts, speech, \nand expression may or may not be discussed or allowed in school settings by Plaintiff Students, \nincluding in extracurricular student groups or school libraries, and requires the removal and \n66 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 67 of 96\n \nexclusion of materials from a school library solely on the basis that they contain a description or \nvisual depiction of a sex act or relate to gender identity or sexual orientation.  \n248.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496. Plaintiffs further request that this Court order Defendant School Districts \nto restore any materials and revert any changes to school policy already made to comply with SF \n496. Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will continue to suffer real and immediate threat \nof irreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and \nthreat of enforcement of SF 496. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law.  \nCOUNT V \nOverbreadth in Violation of First Amendment \n249.

Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants, and Defendants \nURBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROSALIE DACA, in her official capacity \nas  Urbandale  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  KATHERINE  HOWSARE,  \nRACHEL KENT, JENNY MEADE, JASON MENKE, JULIE MITCHELL, STEVE RICHMAN, \nJOSH VAN RYSWYK, CARISSA WILLIAMS, and MARGARET YOUNG, in their official \ncapacities as board members of the Urbandale Community School District. \n254.  Plaintiffs B.F.S. and ROBERT SMITH state this claim against State Defendants \nand Defendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his \nofficial capacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, \nMICHAEL ANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE \nELLIOTT, JILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as \nboard members of the West Des Moines Community Schools District. \n255.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nSIOUX  CITY  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT;  ROD  EARLEYWINE,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Sioux City Community School District Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, \nLANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, \nand EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community \nSchool District.  \n256.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 69 of 96\n \n257.  To the extent a law restricting First Amendment rights possesses a legitimate \nsweep, the First Amendment as applied to the State of Iowa by the Fourteenth Amendment requires \nthere not be a substantial number of instances in which the law would be unconstitutional. \n258.  SF 496, to the extent it possesses any legitimate sweep, is impermissibly overbroad \non  its  face  in  violation  of  the  First  Amendment  because  it  punishes  a  substantial  and \ndisproportionate  amount  of  protected  First  Amendment  activity  in  relation  to  its  purported \nlegitimate sweep. \n259.  The lawโs book ban provisions have resulted in Defendant School Districts and \nother school districts in Iowa creating inconsistent and diverging โbanned book listsโ for removal.  \nNumerous books appear on one or more lists but not others. For example, only 13 books appear \non  all  three  lists  made  public  by  the  three  Defendant  School  Districts  (URBANDALE \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS, and \nIOWA CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT). By contrast, 90 books have been banned in \none of these districts but not the other two. \n260.  The โbanned book listsโ target for removal numerous books containing LGBTQ+ \ncharacters and narratives based on their content and viewpoint. They also include a substantial \nnumber of classic works of literature that prior to SF 496 had been regularly taught in Iowa public \nschools. These books now must be removed and excluded for containing what may be deemed to \nbe a โdescription[] or visual depiction[] of a sex actโ or โpromotionโ of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  \n261.  The lawโs donโt say gay or trans provision has resulted in Defendant School \nDistricts and other school districts in Iowa removing messages of support and affirmation for \nLGBTQ+ students, in addition to childrenโs books featuring real or fictitious LGBTQ+ characters. \n69 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 70 of 96\n \n262.  The lawโs forced outing provision has resulted in burdensome school district \npolicies on nicknames and pronouns and has or will result in serious physical or emotional injury, \nor death for students in home environments unsupportive of LGBTQ+ expression.  \n263.  Because of SF 496โs overbreadth, Plaintiff Students and other students not before \nthe Court have been deprived of access to information and ideas, deprived of access to books based \non their content and viewpoint, and have refrained or will refrain from expressive activity or other \nconstitutionally protected conduct. \n264.  The threat of enforcement of SF 496 deters and chills constitutionally protected \nspeech as Plaintiffs and other LGBTQ+ students choose simply to abstain from protected speech \nrather than undertake the risk of discipline for themselves or teachers. Abstaining from protected \nspeech harms Plaintiffs and society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace \nof ideas. \n265.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief from the Defendants to remedy the \ndeprivations suffered as a result of the violations of their First Amendment rights.  \n266.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief that SF 496 is unconstitutional and \nunenforceable  in  that  it  is  overbroad  and  deprives  Plaintiff  Students  and  others  access  to \nconstitutionally protected information and ideas and books based on their content and viewpoint.  \nAs a result of SF 496โs overbreadth, Plaintiffs Students and other students not before the Court \nhave refrained from and will continue to refrain from expressive activity or other constitutionally \nprotected conduct.  \n267.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496. Plaintiffs further request that this Court order School District Defendants \nto restore any materials and revert any changes to school policy already made to comply with SF \n70 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 71 of 96\n \n496. to comply with SF 496.

Plaintiffs T.S. and B.F. state this claim against State Defendants, and Defendants \nURBANDALE COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROSALIE DACA, in her official capacity \nas  Urbandale  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  KATHERINE  HOWSARE, \n71 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 72 of 96\n \nRACHEL KENT, JENNY MEADE, JASON MENKE, JULIE MITCHELL, STEVE RICHMAN, \nJOSH VAN RYSWYK, CARISSA WILLIAMS, and MARGARET YOUNG, in their official \ncapacities as board members of the Urbandale Community School District. \n273.  Plaintiffs B.F.S. and ROBERT SMITH state this claim against State Defendants \nand Defendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his \nofficial capacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, \nMICHAEL ANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE \nELLIOTT, JILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as \nboard members of the West Des Moines Community Schools District.   \n274.  Plaintiff JAMES DOE states this claim against State Defendants and Defendants \nSIOUX  CITY  COMMUNITY  SCHOOL  DISTRICT;  ROD  EARLEYWINE,  in  his  official \ncapacity as Sioux City Community School District Superintendent; and DAN GREENWELL, \nLANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS, BOB MICHAELSON, \nand EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux City Community \nSchool District. \n275.  Defendants are state actors operating under color of state law. \n276.  The Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, provides \nthat โ[n]o state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ  \n277.  SF 496 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited  States  Constitution  by  discriminating  against  Plaintiff  Students  and  other  LGBTQ+ \nstudents based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status, both facially and \nas applied. \n72 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 73 of 96\n \n278.  SF  496  was  enacted  with  the  purpose  to  discriminate  and  has  the  effect  of \ndiscriminating against LGBTQ+ students, subjecting them to differential and adverse treatment on \nthe basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status.  \n279.  Discrimination against LGBTQ+ students was a motivating factor behind the \npassage of SF 496. The law bears more heavily on LGBTQ+ students than on straight or cisgender \nstudents, and the history, context, and process of its passage illustrate its discriminatory motives. \n280.  SF 496 shames and stigmatizes these students and invites school officials, teachers, \nand classmates to view them as inferior, harms their long-term health and well-being, and denies \nthem equal educational opportunities on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, \nand transgender status. \n281.  SF 496 has contributed to the creation of an anti-LGBTQ+ climate in the public \nschools that Defendants operate. It fosters a culture of silence and non-acceptance of LGBTQ+ \nstudents and discourages school officials from complying with their obligations to treat all students \nequally. \n282.  Discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender \nstatus each warrant at least heightened scrutiny. \n283.  SF 496 does not serve any legitimate purpose, pedagogical or otherwise, let alone \nthe exceedingly persuasive or compelling one required, and is instead rooted in animus toward and \nmoral disapproval of LGBTQ+ people.  \n284.  SF 496 lacks adequate tailoring in service of any such government purpose.  \n285.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ authority and conduct (including \nimplementation and enforcement of SF 496), Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer \nirreparable harm. \n73 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 74 of 96\n \nCOUNT VII \nViolation of Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C. ยง 4071  \n286.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein by this \nreference. \n287.  Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS states this claim against State Defendants and  \nDefendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his official \ncapacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, MICHAEL \nANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE ELLIOTT, \nJILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as school board \nmembers of the West Des Moines Community Schools District; WATERLOO COMMUNITY \nSCHOOL DISTRICT; JARED SMITH, in his official capacity as Waterloo Community School \nDistrict  Superintendent;  and  SUE  FLYNN,  JESSE  KNIGHT,  ASTOR  WILLIAMS,  LYLE \nSCHMITT,  STACIE  MILLS,  JANELLE  EWING,  PAM  ARNDORFER,  and  JEFF \nSOMMERFELDT, in their official capacities as board members of the Waterloo Community \nSchool District; SIOUX CITY COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; ROD EARLEYWINE, in \nhis  official  capacity  as  Sioux  City  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and    DAN \nGREENWELL, LANCE EHMCKE, JAN GEORGE, TREYLA LEE, JOHN MEYERS,  BOB \nMICHAELSON, and EARL MILLER, in their official capacities as board members of the Sioux \nCity Community School District. \n288.  Plaintiff  ROBERT  SMITH  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and \nDefendants WEST DES MOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS; MATT ADAMS, in his official \ncapacity as West Des Moines Community Schools Superintendent; and JEFF HICKS, MICHAEL \nANDRESKI, ELIZABETH LARSON, LILA P. MONTOYA STARR, FANNETTE ELLIOTT, \n74 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 75 of 96\n \nJILL CATON JOHNSON, and ANADELIA MORGAN, in their official capacities as school board \nmembers of the West Des Moines Community Schools District. \n289.  Plaintiff  P.B.-P.  states  this  claim  against  State  Defendants  and  Defendants \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT; JARED SMITH, in his official capacity as \nWaterloo  Community  School  District  Superintendent;  and  SUE  FLYNN,  JESSE  KNIGHT, \nASTOR  WILLIAMS,  LYLE  SCHMITT,  STACIE  MILLS,  JANELLE  EWING,  PAM \nARNDORFER, and JEFF SOMMERFELDT, in their official capacities as board members of the \nWaterloo Community School District. \n290.

Stilwell Junior High is a public secondary school within Defendant WEST DES \nMOINES COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. On information and belief, Stilwell Junior High receives \nfederal financial assistance.  \n292.  Prior to July 1, 2023, Stillwell Junior High had and continues to have a limited open \npublic forum hosting at least one student-led, non-curricular club that meets outside of regular \ninstructional hours. In the calendar year 2022-2023, a GSA was among these student groups. As a \nresult of SF 496, Stilwell Junior High Schoolโs GSA no longer is able to meet. Other non-curricular \nclubs are permitted to meet and have in fact met during fall 2023. \n75 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 76 of 96\n \n293.  Waterloo  West  High  School  is  a  public  secondary  school  within  Defendant \nWATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT.  On information and belief, Waterloo West \nHigh School receives federal financial assistance. \n294.  Prior to SF 496, Waterloo West High School had an active GSA.  SF 496, however, \nhas caused the number of members of the Waterloo West High School GSA to dwindle.  Students \nnow fear being outed to unsupportive family members and increased bullying and harassment from \npeers as a result of SF 496โs forced outing provision. \n295.  North High School is a public secondary school within Defendant SIOUX CITY \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. On information and belief, North High School receives \nfederal financial assistance. \n296.  Prior to SF 496, North High Schoolโs GSA provided a sense of community to \nLGBTQ+ students.  However, LGBTQ+ students are now reluctant to join the GSA because they \nfear being outed to unsupportive parents as a result of the SF 496โs forced outing provision and \nfear they will face negative consequences at home.  \n297.  Advisors for members of Plaintiff IOWA SAFE SCHOOLSโ GSA network have \nhad advisors prohibited from participating in group discussion, in contrast to advisors of other \nstudent-led,  non-curricular  clubs.  They  have  also  been  prohibited  from  displaying  signs  or \npromoting their GSA in classrooms or hallways where students younger than seventh graders may \nbe present, even though other clubs are not subject to those restrictions.  GSAs also have been \noutright prohibited from existing in schools with sixth graders or below present.  \n298.  The donโt say gay or trans provision, all-ages ban, and forced outing provisions of \nSF 496, on their face and as applied, deny equal access or a fair opportunity to GSAs.  \n76 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 77 of 96\n \n299.  The donโt say gay or trans provision, all-ages ban, and forced outing provisions of \nSF 496, on their face and as applied, also discriminate against GSAs on the basis of the religious, \npolitical, philosophical, or other content of the speech at their meetings.  \n300.  By prohibiting students from meeting and advertising GSA events on the same \nterms  as  other  non-curricular  clubs,  State  Defendants,  Defendant  WEST  DES  MOINES \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOLS, WATERLOO COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, SIOUX CITY \nCOMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, and other school districts implementing SF 496 in a similar \nmanner are in violation of the Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C. ยง 4071.  \n301.  Plaintiffs are entitled to prospective relief from the Defendants to remedy the \ndeprivations suffered as a result of the violations of their rights under the Equal Access Act.  \n302.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief and request this Court enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing SF 496 to prohibit students from becoming members of GSAs or attending GSA \nmeetings and events on the same terms as other non-curricular groups, or to prohibit these GSAs \nfrom advertising or promoting their group on the same terms as other non-curricular groups. \nPlaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will continue to suffer real and immediate threat of \nirreparable injury as a direct and proximate result of the existence, operation, enforcement, and \nthreat of enforcement of SF 496. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or speedy remedy at law. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request an order and judgment:  \n1.  Declaring that SF 496 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to Plaintiffs and \nis unenforceable.  \n2.  Permanently enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and \nall persons in active concert or participation with them from enforcing SF 496. \n3.  Awarding the Plaintiffs reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs; and  \n77 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 1   Filed 11/28/23   Page 78 of 96\n \n4.

INTRODUCTION. \nPlaintiffs in two parallel cases seek a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of \nSenate File 496, which, as relevant here, does three things: (1) requires the removal of any book \nfrom Iowa public school libraries that contains a description or visual depiction of a โsex actโ; \n(2) forbids school districts, teachers, and other licensed professionals from, among other things, \nproviding programs, promotion, and instruction to students in grade six or below relating to \nโgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ; and (3) requires school districts to notify a childโs \nparents if the child requests an accommodation relating to gender identity, such as asking to use \ndifferent pronouns than those in registration records.  \nAs to the book restrictions, the Court GRANTS the Motions for Preliminary Injunction \nand ENJOINS the enforcement of Senate File 496. The law is incredibly broad and has resulted \nin the removal of hundreds of books from school libraries, including, among others, nonfiction \nhistory books, classic works of fiction, Pulitzer Prize winning contemporary novels, books that \nregularly appear on Advanced Placement exams, and even books designed to help students avoid \nbeing victimized by sexual assault. The sweeping restrictions in Senate File 496 are unlikely to \nsatisfy the First Amendment under any standard of scrutiny and thus may not be enforced while \nthe case is pending. Indeed, the Court has been unable to locate a single case upholding the \nconstitutionality of a school library restriction even remotely similar to Senate File 496.   \nAs to the restrictions on programs, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity \nand sexual orientation, there appears to be a severe misunderstandingโin two different waysโ\nby some of the parties about what Senate File 496 says. First, nothing in the law restricts the \nability of school districts, teachers, or other professionals to provide programs, promotion, and/or \ninstruction of gender identity and sexual orientation to students in grade seven and above. School \ndistricts instead have full freedom to offer gay-straight alliances (โGSAsโ) or similar clubs that \nprovide resources and support for LGBTQ+ students in grades seven and above. Teachers and \nother licensed professionals are not restricted in any way from serving as advisors for such \nGSAs,  displaying  rainbow  flags,  providing  instruction  on  gay  and  transgender  rights,  and \notherwise performing their responsibilities in a manner that emphasizes inclusiveness and respect \nfor LGBTQ+ students in grades seven and above. Likewise, students in grade seven and above \nare  free  to  engage  in  whatever  forms  of  expression  they  wish,  subject  only  to  generally \napplicable restrictions that apply equally to all students. To the extent school districts, teachers, \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 4 of 46\nor students have been interpreting the law otherwise, they are simply wrong. It follows that none \nof the Student Plaintiffs in grade seven or above have standing to challenge the restrictions in \nSenate File 496 on programs, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity and sexual \norientation. There is nothing for them to challenge.  \nSecond, but conversely, there is also a misunderstanding of Senate File 496 as it relates to \nstudents  in  grade  six  and  below.  The  law  forbids  programs,  promotion,  and  instruction  to \nstudents in those grades relating to โgender identityโ and โsexual orientation,โ but those terms \nare defined a neutral way that makes no distinction between cisgender or transgender identity or \ngay or straight relationships. Meaning: on its face, the law forbids any programs, promotion, or \ninstruction recognizing that anyone is male or female or in a relationship of any sort (gay or \nstraight). The statute is therefore content-neutral but so wildly overbroad that every school \ndistrict and elementary school teacher in the State has likely been violating it since the day the \nschool year started. This renders the statute void for vagueness under the due process clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment because the State will have unfettered discretion to decide when to \nenforce it and against whom, thus making it all but impossible for a reasonable person to know \nwhat will and will not lead to punishment. Because at least two Plaintiffsโone fourth grade \nstudent and one sixth grade teacherโhave standing to challenge this aspect of Senate File 496, \nthe Court GRANTS the Motions for Preliminary Injunction and ENJOINS the enforcement of \nthe restrictions on programs, promotion and instruction relating to gender identity and sexual \norientation.   \nFinally, no Plaintiff has standing to challenge the provisions of Senate File 496 requiring \nschool districts to notify a childโs parents if the child asks for the use of pronouns that do not \nmatch the schoolโs registration records or otherwise seeks an accommodation relating to gender \nidentity. Only the GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs challenge this portion of the law, but they are \nall  already  โoutโ  to  their  families  and  therefore  not  affected  in  a  concrete  way  by  this \nrequirement. Thus, the Court has no authority to do anything except DENY the GLBT Youth \nStudent Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction as it relates to this aspect of Senate File \n496. \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 5 of 46\nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND. \nA.  Senate File 496. \nIn late April 2023, the Iowa Legislature passed Senate File 496. The Governor signed the \nbill into law on May 26, 2023. As relevant here, Senate File 496 amended Iowa law in three \nprimary ways, one relating to the availability of books and other materials in school library \nprograms, another addressing programs, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity \nand sexual orientation for students in grade six and below, and a third involving parental rights. \nSome provisions took effect on or before July 1, 2023, while others are scheduled to take effect \non January 1, 2024.  \n1.  Provisions of Senate File 496 Relating to School Libraries. \nAs it relates to school libraries, Senate File 496 amends Iowa Code ยง 256.11 to require \neach school district to establish a โkindergarten through grade twelve library program that is \nconsistent with section 280.6 and with the educational standards established in this section, \ncontains only age-appropriate materials, and supports the student achievement goals of the total \nschool curriculum.โ The phrase โage-appropriateโ is newly defined in section 256.11(19) to \nmean โtopics, messages, and teaching methods suitable to particular ages or age groups of \nchildren and adolescents, based on developing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacity \ntypical  for  the  age  or  age  group.  โAge-appropriateโ  does  not  include  any  material  with \ndescriptions or visual depictions of a sex act as defined in section 702.17.โ In turn, Iowa Code ยง \n702.17 defines โsex actโ to mean: \nany sexual contact between two or more persons by any of the following: \n1.  Penetration of the penis into the vagina or anus. \n2.  Contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus or by \ncontact between the genitalia of one person and the genitalia or \nanus of another person. \n3.  Contact between the finger, hand, or other body part of one person \nand the genitalia or anus of another person, except in the course of \nexamination or treatment by a [licensed professional]. \n4.

The touching of a personโs own genitals or anus with a finger, \nhand,  or  artificial  sexual  organ  or  other  similar  device  at  the \ndirection of another person. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 6 of 46\nSenate File 496, on its face, does not permit school officials to take context into account when \ndetermining whether a book is โage-appropriateโ or contains a โsex act.โ Meaning: the law \nprohibits such books even if the โsex actโ was, say, an impetus for legislation (e.g., books \ndescribing the history of laws geared toward preventing sexual assault), important for historical \nreasons (such as โsex actsโ that played a central role in political campaigns or served as the basis \nfor impeaching a sitting president), or played an important role in an award-winning work of \nfiction like explaining a characterโs emotional development (as in the case of books written by \nsome Plaintiffs here). The law also prohibits students from being involved in deciding whether a \nbook should be removed or not. See Iowa Code ยง 279.81 (โ[A] school district shall not allow a \nstudent to serve on any committee that determines, or provides recommendations related to, \nwhether a material in a library operated by a school district should be removed.โ).  \n  School districts and school employees are subject to graduated penalties for failing to \nremove  non-age-appropriate  materials  from  school  library  programs.  See  Iowa  Code  ยง \n256.11(9)(a)(2). For the first offense, the Iowa Department of Education โshall issue a written \nwarning to the board of directors of the school district or the employee, as applicable.โ Id. For a \nsecond or subsequent violation, the school district superintendent and/or employee โshall be \nsubject to a hearing conducted by the board of educational examiners pursuant to [Iowa Code ยง] \n272.2, subsection 14, which may result in disciplinary action.โ Id. The penalty provisions go into \neffect on January 1, 2024. See id.  \n  On November 15, 2023, the Iowa State Board of Education issued Proposed Rules to \nassist school officials in implementing Senate File 496. (Penguin House Docket1 ECF 1-2.) The \nProposed Rules include a proposed new definition of โage-appropriateโ in Iowa Admin. Code \n281โ12.2(256). (Id.) The proposed definition adopts the language of Iowa Code ยง 256.11(19) \nverbatim but adds one sentence (in bold typeface, with the immediately-preceding language also \nincluded for context):  โ . . . โAge-appropriateโ does not include any material with descriptions or \nvisual depictions of a sex act. A reference or mention of a sex act in a way that does not \ndescribe or visually depict a sex act as defined in that section is not included in the previous \nsentence . . . .โ (Id., p. 4.) The Iowa State Board of Education invited public comment and \n \n1 All references to โPenguin House Docket ECFโ are to the docket entries on the electronic case filing (โECFโ) \nsystem in Case No. 4:23-cv-00478.

These page numbers often do not correspond to the \nnumbers placed by the parties on the bottom of their filings.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 7 of 46\nscheduled hearings for January 3 and 4, 2024. (Id., p. 3.) The Proposed Rules will not become \nfinal, if they become final at all, until after the penalty provisions in Iowa Code ยง 256.11(9)(a)(2) \ntake effect on January 1, 2024.  \nAccording to declarations submitted by the Penguin House Plaintiffs, the enactment of \nSenate File 496 has led to many problems. First, there is widespread disagreement among school \ndistricts regarding which books must be removed to comply with the law. (Penguin House \nDocket ECF 34-9, ยถ 22; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-10, ยถยถ 13, 14.) Using five school \ndistricts  as  examples,  the  Penguin  House  Plaintiffs  have  submitted  lengthy  charts  showing \nconsiderable variation in the books each district has concluded must be removed from school \nlibraries. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-15.) For example, \nthe Nevada Community School District has removed 179 books that have not been identified for \nremoval by any of the other four exemplar school districts. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14.)   \nSecond,  and  relatedly,  school  officials  are  uncertain  as  to  how  to  apply  the  โage-\nappropriateโ standard. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-2, pp. 2โ4.) The confusion has led school \ndistricts and educators to err on the side of removing books out of fear of being penalized for \nfailing to do so. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-11, ยถ 18.) In total, and just considering the \nthirty-seven school districts that have made public the list of books they have removed from their \nlibraries, there are more than 500 books that have been removed from at least one school library \ndue to Senate File 496. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14.) Moreover, some teachers are \nhesitant to purchase new books for students that even arguably might contain prohibited material. \n(Penguin House Docket ECF 34-11, ยถ 15.) Many teachers have reduced or eliminated book \ncollections in their classrooms out of fear of retaliation or discipline. (Penguin House Docket \nECF 34-9, ยถ 12.) The Penguin House Plaintiffs allege that the Iowa State Board of Education did \nnot provide any guidance prior to issuing the Proposed Rules on November 15, 2023, and that \nthe Proposed Rules issued on that date do not provide adequate guidance for how to ensure \ncompliance with the law. \nThird, Senate File 496 has led to the removal from school libraries of non-fiction and \nfiction books alike, across a variety of genres. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14.) For example, \nschool districts have removed well-known works of classic fiction by authors such as James \nJoyce  (Ulysses),  William  Faulkner  (As  I  Lay  Dying),  Joseph  Heller  (Slaughterhouse  Five), \nAldous Huxley (Brave New World), and Richard Wright (Native Son). (Id.) They also have \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 8 of 46\nremoved award-winning books by contemporary authors like Toni Morrison (Beloved, Song of \nSolomon, The Bluest Eye), Malinda Lo (Last Night at the Telegraph Club), Sapphire (Push: A \nNovel),  John  Green  (The  Fault  in  Our  Stars,  Looking  for  Alaska),  Jodi  Picoult  (Nineteen \nMinutes), Laurie Halse Anderson (Speak, Shout), and Maya Angelou (I Know Why the Caged \nBird Sings), among many others. (Id.; see also Penguin House Docket ECF 34-1, ยถยถ 5, 6; \nPenguin House Docket ECF 34-1.) Four of these authors are Plaintiffs in the Penguin House case \nand allege that Senate File 496 has taken away an important channel for them to speak to \nstudentsโtheir intended audienceโthrough their books. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-5, ยถ \n11; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-6, ยถ 7; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-7, ยถ 8; Penguin House \nDocket ECF 34-8, ยถ 7.) These authors also allege that Senate File 496 has stigmatized their \nbooks by falsely labeling them as โpornography.โ (E.g., Penguin House Docket ECF 34-8, ยถ 7.) \nStudents likewise allege that Senate File 496 has rendered them unable to read or discuss books \nin school that they otherwise would have wanted to read and discuss. (Penguin House Docket \nECF 34-3, ยถ 6; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-4, ยถยถ 6, 8โ10.)   \n2.  Provisions  of  Senate  File  496  Relating  to  Gender  Identity  and  Sexual \nOrientation. \nSenate File 496 also enacted new Iowa Code ยง 279.80, entitled โSexual orientation and \ngender identity โ prohibited instruction.โ It states that โ[a] school district shall not provide any \nprogram, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender \nidentity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.โ  Iowa Code ยง \n279.80(2). โGender identityโ is defined in section 216.2(10) as โa gender-related identity of a \nperson, regardless of the personโs assigned sex at birth.โ โSexual orientationโ is defined in \nsection 216.2(14) as โactual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.โ The \nPenguin House Plaintiffs argue that the plain language of section 279.80, when considered in \nconjunction with the definitions in section 216.2 (which section 279.80 says must be applied), \nmake it impermissible for a book or lesson to mention gender identity (whether cisgender or \ntransgender) and/or sexual orientation (whether gay or straight). (Penguin House Docket ECF 34, \np. 12; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-10, ยถ 17.)  \nThe plain meaning of section 279.80 supports the Penguin House Plaintiffsโ position. The \nphrase โgender identityโ is defined neutrally in section 216.2(10) to include cisgender  and \ntransgender students alike. Thus, for example, a biological girl who identifies as a girl has a \nโgender identityโ under the plain language of section 216.2(10) that cannot be the subject of a \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 9 of 46\nprogram, promotion, or instruction. Same for a biological boy who identifies as a boy. It follows \nthat any program, promotion, or instruction that refers to students in grade six or below as โboysโ \nor โgirlsโ appears to be forbidden under the plain language of the statute. Schools apparently \ncannot, for example, offer โboysโ or โgirlsโ basketball teams for sixth graders, as the existence of \nsuch teams would amount to a โprogram [or] promotion . . . relating to gender identity.โ The \nsame is true for โboysโ and โgirlsโ bathrooms: merely labeling them as such โpromot[es]โ the \nconcept of โgender identity,โ in apparent violation of section 279.80. Similarly, under the plain \nlanguage of the statute, it appears that a teacher cannot instruct students to refer to the teacher as \nโMr. _______โ or โMiss ______,โ as this would be an โinstructionโ that โrelat[es] toโ the \nteacherโs โgender identity,โ which is a verboten topic. It also appears to be impermissible for \nteachers to identify historical figures or literary characters as being either male or female or use \nmasculine or feminine pronouns to refer to them, as any such discussion would, again, amount to \npromotion or instruction that relates to the personโs gender identity. \nThe definition of โsexual orientationโ is similarly neutral, as it encompasses โactual or \nperceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.โ Iowa Code ยง 216.2(14). On its face, \nthis  definition  includes  people  who  are  heterosexual,  homosexual,  and  bisexual  alike.  It \nfollowsโagain, under the plain language of Senate File 496โthat schools apparently may not \nprovide students in grade six and below any program, promotion, or instruction relating to sexual \norientation in any form, including heteronormative relationships. This means teachers must, for \nexample, be careful when talking to students about their families, as any such discussion might \nโpromoteโ or โinstructโ the idea that the studentโs parents have a sexual orientation (gay or \nstraight),  which  is  a  forbidden  topic.  It  likewise  appears  that  teachers  cannot  incorporate \ndiscussion of their own spousesโmale or femaleโinto classroom instruction, as this would \nreveal the teachersโ sexual orientation and thus, again, amount to โinstruction relating to . . . \nsexual orientation.โ  \nStated differently, opponents of Senate File 496 have sometimes described it as a โdonโt \nsay gayโ or โdonโt say transโ bill. Based on the plain language of the statute, this is not an \naccurate description. It is actually a โdonโt say anythingโ bill. On its face, it prohibits school \ndistricts and teachers from providing any program, promotion, and instruction that relates to \ngender identity (cisgender or transgender) or sexual orientation (gay, straight, or otherwise) in \nany way.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 10 of 46\nThe Court understands, of course, that this is likely not what the Iowa Legislature was \ntrying to accomplish when it passed Senate File 496. Indeed, the State Defendants2 and GLBT \nYouth Plaintiffs alike characterize this interpretation of the law as โabsurd,โ and both argueโfor \ndifferent  reasonsโthat  the  law  is  designed  to  prohibit  discussion  of  homosexuality  and \ntransgenderism. (The Penguin House Plaintiffs, by contrast, correctly interpret the plain language \nof the law.) The problem, however, is that the Court cannot interpret Senate File 496 as targeting \ntransgender identities and homosexual relationships without substituting the Courtโs own choice \nof words for the ones chosen by the Legislature. This the Court cannot do. \nThe Penguin House Plaintiffs allege that section 279.80 is โvague and impossible to \napply in a consistent or constitutionally permissible manner.โ (Penguin House Docket ECF 34, p. \n12.) They argue that school officials are uncertain as to whether or how the law applies to school \nlibraries; for example, some districts have interpreted section 279.80 to mean that โlibraries are \nnot allowed to have books that include LGBTQ+ characters.โ (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-\n10, ยถ 17.) Others have interpreted it, in conjunction with other aspects of Senate File 496, to \nmean that students in grade six and below cannot have access to books with LGBTQ+ characters, \nbut those in grades seven through twelve are not so restricted (provided, of course, that the books \nfor seventh through twelfth graders are โage-appropriateโ and do not contain โsex actsโ). The \nState Defendants concede, to some degree, that section 279.80 does not apply to school libraries, \nalthough they also allege that it prohibits teachers in grades six and below from assigning or \nreading books with gay or transgender characters. Similarly, one Iowa legislator made public \nstatements to the effect that the law is only intended to prohibit schools from making books with \ngay or transgender characters available to students in kindergarten through sixth grade. (Penguin \nHouse Docket ECF 34-18, p. 4.)  \n3.  Provisions of Senate File 496 Relating to Parental Rights. \nFinally, Senate File 496 added various provisions to the Iowa Code related to parental \nrights in education. Newly enacted Iowa Code ยง 601.1(2) states that โa parent or guardian bears \nthe ultimate responsibility, and has the fundamental, constitutionally protected right, to make \ndecisions affecting the parentโs or guardianโs minor child, including decisions relating to the \nminor childโs medical care, moral upbringing, religious upbringing, residence, education, and \n \n2 The Court will use โState Defendantsโ to refer, collectively, to Governor Kim Reynolds, McKenzie Snow, John \nRobbins, Chad Janzen, the Iowa Department of Education, and the Iowa State Board of Education in the GLBT \nYouth case and, collectively, John Robbins, McKenzie Snow, and Chad Janzen in the Penguin House case.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 11 of 46\nextracurricular activities. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.โ \nThere are exceptions for emergency medical care and suspected child abuse. Iowa Code ยง \n601.1(3), (4).  \nSenate  File 496 also  enacted new  Iowa Code ยง 279.78, entitled โParental rights in \neducation.โ  Section  279.78(2)  prohibits  a  school  district  from  โknowingly  giving  false  or \nmisleading information to the parent or guardian of a student regarding the studentโs gender \nidentity or intention to transition to a gender that is different than the sex listed on a studentโs \nofficial birth certificate . . . .โ Section 279.78(3) requires a โlicensed practitionerโ to inform a \nschool district administrator if a student โrequests an accommodation that is intended to affirm \nthe studentโs gender identity . . . including a request that the licensed practitioner address the \nstudent using a name or pronoun that is different than the name or pronoun assigned to the \nstudent  in  the  school  districtโs  registration  forms  or  records.โ  In  turn,  the  school  district \nadministrator โshall report the studentโs request to the studentโs parent or guardian.โ Id.  \nThe  phrase  โlicensed  practitionerโ  is  defined,  in  two  parts,  in  Iowa  Code  ยง  272.1. \nโLicensedโ means, in relevant part, โthe authority that is given to allow a person to legally serve \nas  a  practitioner,โ  while  โpractitionerโ  means  โan  administrator,  teacher,  or  other  licensed \nprofessional, including an individual who holds a statement of professional recognition, who \nprovides educational assistance to students.โ Iowa Code ยง 272.1(4), (7). Thus, the โlicensed \npractitionersโ  who  must  report  requests  for  gender  identity  accommodations  under  section \n279.78 include, among others, teachers, librarians, and administrators.  \nLike the school library provisions, Senate File 496 establishes graduated penalties for \nโlicensed  practitionersโ  who  violate  the  disclosure  requirements,  starting  with  a  โwritten \nwarningโ from the Iowa Department of Education for a first offense, followed by a disciplinary \nhearing, โwhich may result in disciplinary action,โ for a second or subsequent offense. Iowa \nCode ยง 279.78(4). \nB.  Procedural History.  \nThe GLBT Youth Plaintiffs filed their Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction \non November 28, 2023. (GLBT Youth Docket3 ECF 1; GLBT Youth Docket ECF 2.) The \n \n3 All references to โGLBT Youth Docketโ are to the docket entries on the ECF system in Case No. 4:23-cv-00474. \nAll references to page numbers are to the auto-populated page numbers by the ECF system, located in the upper-\nright corner of each page. These page numbers often do not correspond to the numbers placed by the parties on the \nbottom of their filings. \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 12 of 46\nPenguin  House  Plaintiffs  filed  their  Complaint  on  November  30,  2023,  and  Motion  for \nPreliminary Injunction on December 8, 2023. (Penguin House Docket ECF 1; Penguin House \nDocket ECF 28.) The State Defendants resist each motion in its entirety. (GLBT Youth Docket \nECF 53; Penguin House Docket ECF 45.) The School District Defendants4 take no position on \nthe motions, as they contend that they have no standing to challenge the constitutionality of a \nstate law and instead simply must follow it. (GLBT Youth Docket ECF 48; Penguin House \nDocket ECF 40.) Separately, but on essentially the same grounds, the School District Defendants \nhave moved to dismiss. (GLBT Youth Docket ECF 51; Penguin House Docket ECF 46.) \nThe Court has not formally consolidated the two cases, but, in the interest of efficiency, \nheld a single hearing on the separate motions for preliminary injunction. For similar efficiency \nreasons, the Court is issuing this single ruling in both cases.  \nIII.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARDS. \nโA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.โ Tumey \nv. Mycroft AI, Inc., 27 F.4th 657, 664 (8th Cir. 2022) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)). โ[T]he burden of establishing the propriety of an injunction is on the \nmovant.โ Turtle Island Foods, SPC v. Thompson, 992 F.3d 694, 699 (8th Cir. 2021) (citation \nomitted). The Court must consider four factors: โ(1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; \n(2) the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will \ninflict on other parties litigant; (3) the probability that [the] movant will succeed on the merits; \nand (4) the public interest.โ Sleep No. Corp. v. Young, 33 F.4th 1012, 1016 (8th Cir. 2022) \n(alteration in original) (quoting Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. \n1981) (en banc)). \nโWhile no single factor is determinative, the probability of success factor is the most \nsignificant.โ Carson v. Simon, 978 F.3d 1051, 1059 (8th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). For actions that \nseek to enjoin the enforcement of a duly enacted state statute, the moving parties must show that \nthey are likely to prevail on their claims. D.M. by Bao Xiong v. Minn. State High Sch. League, \n917 F.3d 994, 1000 (8th Cir. 2019). This is a higher standard than applies in other preliminary \ninjunction cases. See id. โWe apply a higher standard in such instances because the duly enacted \nstate  statute  constitutes  government  action  based  on  presumptively  reasoned  democratic \n \n4 The Court will use โSchool District Defendantsโ to refer, collectively, to the School Districts, School District \nBoards of Directors, School District Board Members, and School District Superintendents in both cases.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 13 of 46\nprocesses, and such action is entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined \nlightly.โ Id. (internal punctuation and citation omitted).   \nWith respect to the remaining three factors, a plaintiff โis not required to prove with \ncertainty the threat of irreparable harm, but it must prove that irreparable injury is likely in the \nabsence of an injunction.โ Sleep No. Corp., 33 F.4th at 1018 (citations omitted). โIrreparable \nharm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be \nfully compensated through an award of damages.โ General Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown's, \nLLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009). โIn balancing the equities, [the Court] weigh[s] โthe \nthreat of irreparable harmโ shown by the movant against โthe injury that granting the injunction \nwill inflict on other parties litigant.โโ MPAY Inc. v. Erie Custom Computer Applications, Inc., \n970 F.3d 1010, 1020 (8th Cir. 2020) (quoting Dataphase Sys., 640 F.2d at 113.) This โrequires a \ncourt  to  distinguish  between  weak  or  illusory  injuries  and  very  real  threats  of  injuries.โ \nRodriguez v. Molina, No. 422-cv-00183-SMR-HCA, 2022 WL 2287805, at *3 (S.D. Iowa June \n24, 2022) (cleaned up). It considers harm to both the litigants and other interested parties, like \nthe public. Wachovia Sec., L.L.C. v. Stanton, 571 F. Supp. 2d 1014, 1047 (N.D. Iowa 2008). The \nlast factor, the public interest, โinvites the court to indulge in broad observations about conduct \nthat is generally recognizable as costly or injurious.โ Id. at 1048. \nIV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS: STANDING. \nA.  Legal Standards.  \nThe preliminary question is which of the plaintiffs in the two cases, if any, have standing \nto  challenge  Senate  File  496.  To  establish  standing,  โa  plaintiff  must  present  a  โcaseโ  or \nโcontroversyโ within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution.โ Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 588 F.3d 585, 591 (8th Cir. 2009). โThis โirreducible constitutional minimum of standingโ \nrequires a showing of โinjury in factโ to the plaintiff that is โfairly traceable to the challenged \naction of the defendant,โ and โlikely [to] be redressed by a favorable decision.โโ Id. (quoting \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560โ61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). \nโWhether a plaintiff has shown such an injury โoften turns on the nature and source of the claim \nasserted.โโ Braden, 588 F.3d at 591 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, (1975)). โ[T]he \nquestion whether he has a cognizable injury sufficient to confer standing is closely bound up \nwith the question of whether and how the law will grant him relief.โ Braden, 588 F.3d at 591. \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 14 of 46\nBoth the GLBT Youth and Penguin House cases revolve primarily around the First \nAmendment,  in  conjunction  with  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  โA  plaintiff  claiming  an \nabridgment of the [First Amendment] right to free speech has standing to seek pre-enforcement \nreview of a policy โunder circumstances that render the threatened enforcement sufficiently \nimminent.โโ Parents Defending Educ. v. Linn Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 83 F.4th 658, 666 (8th Cir. \n2023) (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014)). โA plaintiff \nsatisfies the injury-in-fact requirement where he alleges โan intention to engage in a course of \nconduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there \nexists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.โ Id. (quoting Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 159 \n(internal quotation omitted)).  \nB.  All Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Book Restrictions, But None Have \nStanding to Challenge the Parental Rights Provision and Only a Few Have Standing \nto Challenge the Restrictions on Programs, Promotion and Instruction Relating to \nGender Identity and Sexual Orientation. \n1.  Educator Plaintiffs. \nThe Court will analyze standing in groups, starting with the educators (the โEducator \nPlaintiffsโ) in the Penguin House case. The Court concludes that the Educator Plaintiffs have \nstanding  to  challenge  Senate  File  496  with  respect  to  both  the  book  restrictions  and  the \nrestrictions  on  programs,  promotion,  and  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  and  sexual \norientation. \nAs it relates to the latter, Plaintiff Daniel Gutmann has standing because he teaches sixth \ngrade students (among others) and therefore is directly implicated by the restrictions in Iowa \nCode ยง 279.80. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-12, ยถ 1.) In particular, he makes books available \nto his students that he worries will be deemed to constitute a โprogramโ or โpromotionโ relating \nto gender identity and sexual orientation, resulting in potential sanctions against his licensure and \nloss of employment. (Id., ยถ 13.) Gutmann has standing because he wishes to engage in speech \nthat is โarguably affected with a constitutional interest,โ there is a credible threat of enforcement \nif he does so, and his injury is fairly traceable to potential enforcement of the law by the Iowa \nDepartment of Education or other state officials. See Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 666. \nAnother Educator Plaintiff, Alyson Browder, teaches seventh grade but makes books \navailable to sixth, seventh, and eighth graders alike, some of which she fears (as to sixth graders) \nwill be considered โpromotionโ of gender identity or sexual orientation, causing her to limit the \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 15 of 46\naccessibility of those books to seventh and eighth graders only. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-\n11, ยถยถ 5โ6, 14.) She worries that she will be subjected to sanctions against her licensure or loss \nof employment if anyone makes a complaint against her regarding the books in her classroom. \n(Id., ยถ 17.) She, too, has standing under Parents Defending Educ. to challenge the restrictions in \nsection 279.80 relating to gender identity and sexual orientation.  \nThe same is true for the third Educator Plaintiff, Mari Butler Abry, who is a school \nlibrarian for her school district and involved in making decisions as to which books will be made \navailable to students in libraries throughout the district. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-10, ยถยถ 1, \n11.) As it relates to section 279.80, she has been required to remove materials that may be \ndeemed to constitute a โprogramโ or โpromotionโ of gender identity or sexual orientation. (Id., ยถ \n12.) She worries that she will be subjected to sanctions against her licensure or termination of her \nemployment if she is deemed to have violated the law. (Id., ยถยถ 4โ6.) \nFinally, the fourth Educator Plaintiff, the Iowa State Education Association (โISEAโ), has \norganizational standing to challenge the restrictions on programs, promotion and instruction \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation because ISEA is a labor union that includes the \nthree other Educator Plaintiffs as members, along with thousands of other teachers and librarians \nacross the State of Iowa. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-9, ยถยถ 4, 5.) Organizations โcan assert \nthe standing of their members.โ Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009). In \naddition, organizations have standing in some circumstances when โthe interests at stake [are] \ngermane to the organizationโs purpose.โ Mo. Coal. for Envโt v. FERC, 544 F.3d 955, 957 (8th \nCir. 2008). Here, as it relates to restrictions on programs, promotion and instruction relating to \ngender identity and sexual orientation, Senate File 496 directly affects ISEAโs members in a \nmanner that would give the members standing to sue in their own right because violations of the \nlaw could lead to loss of the membersโ licenses or employment. This is enough to give ISEA \nitself standing. See Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engโrs, 645 F.3d 978, 986โ88 (8th Cir. \n2011) (holding that organizations had standing because, inter alia, individual members were at \nimminent  risk  of  concrete  injury).  Similarly,  Senate  File  496  threatens  interests  that  are \nโgermane to [ISEAโs] purposeโ of providing support for teachers and other licensed education \nprofessionals. See Mo. Coal. for Envโt, 544 F.3d at 957 (holding that organization had standing \ndue to increased risk of harm to organizationโs purpose). This, too, is sufficient to establish \nstanding.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 16 of 46\nDuring the preliminary injunction hearing, it briefly appeared that the dispute between \nthe Educator Plaintiffs and Defendants had been rendered moot with respect to the restrictions on \nprograms, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity and sexual orientation. The State \nDefendants conceded, to some degree, that these restrictions did not apply to library programs or \nmake it impermissible for a teacher to have a classroom library that includes books with gay \ncharacters, same-sex relationships, or other discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation. \nAfter drilling down further, however, the Court is unable to conclude the issue is moot. The State \nDefendants walked back the concession to some degree, with their counsel acknowledging that a \nteacher in grade six or below could not assign a book to students that contains a gay character. \n(Tr.5 84.) Moreover, the State Defendantsโ concession appears to have been premised on their \nposition that section 279.80 only forbids โcompulsory curriculumโ related to gender identity or \nsexual orientation. For reasons explained above, this premise is inconsistent with the plain \nlanguage of the law, which forbids a broader  range of conduct, including โprogramsโ  and \nโpromotion,โ among other things. Teachers like the Educator Plaintiffs here who make books \navailable  to  sixth  graders  for  the  specific  purpose  of,  among  other  things,  helping  them \nunderstand their sexuality, making them feel comfortable about who they are, or otherwise \naddressing student questions or concerns have likely engaged in โpromotionโ of gender identity \nand sexual orientation under the plain language of Senate File 496. The State Defendantsโ \npromise not to enforce the law as written in such situations is therefore not enough to render the \ndispute moot or defeat standing. See United Food & Com. Workers Intโl Union, AFL-CIO, CLC \nv. IBP, Inc., 857 F.2d 422, 430 (8th Cir. 1988) (plaintiff had standing even though defendants \nโhad no present intention to enforce the statutesโ); see also 281 Care Comm. v. Arenson, 638 \nF.3d 621, 628 (8th Cir. 2011) (plaintiffs had standing because they โalleged that they wish to \nengage in conduct that could reasonably be interpreted as [violating the regulation]โ).  \nAll four Educator Plaintiffs also have standing to challenge the aspects of Senate File 496 \nrelating to the removal of books and other materials that are not โage-appropriateโ as defined \nunder the law. As a school librarian, Abry is particularly affected by the โage-appropriateโ \nrestrictions because she is at the center of her school districtโs efforts to comply with Senate File \n496. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-10, ยถยถ 1, 11.) She will be subject to penalties, up to and \n \n5 All cites to โTr.โ are to the rough draft of the transcript from the preliminary injunction hearing on December 22, \n2023.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 17 of 46\nincluding license suspension and termination of employment, if she violates Senate File 496. \n(Id., ยถ 22.) The other Educator PlaintiffsโBrowder and Gutmannโalso maintain libraries or \nbook collections in their classrooms that are made available to students. (Penguin House Docket \nECF 34-11, ยถยถ 5, 13; Penguin House Docket ECF 34-12, ยถยถ 5, 6.) They, too, credibly worry that \nthey will be subject to penalties, up to and including license suspension and termination of \nemployment,  if  their  classroom  libraries  include  books  or  materials  that  are  not  โage-\nappropriateโ as defined under the law. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34-11, ยถ 17; Penguin House \nDocket ECF 34-12, ยถ 13.) Indeed, according to information provided by the State Defendants, \nthe availability of books in the classroom (not merely the library) is part of what led to the \npassage of Senate File 496. (Penguin House Docket ECF 45-1, p. 76.) It follows that there is a \nsubstantial risk of classroom teachers being subject to discipline if they fail to follow the age-\nappropriate requirements. This is enough to give the Educator Plaintiffs standing. Finally, the \nISEA has standing because its members would have individual standing in their own right and \nSenate File 496 threatens interests germane to the organizationโs interests. See, e.g., Sierra Club, \n645 F.3d at 986โ88; Mo. Coal. for Envโt, 544 F.3d at 957. \n2.  Publisher/Author Plaintiffs. \nThe  Publisher/Author  Plaintiffs  are  situated  differently  than  the  Educator  Plaintiffs \nbecause none of them are licensed by the State of Iowa or employed by an Iowa school district. \nThey therefore cannot โviolateโ Senate File 496 at all, much less in a way that would cause them \nto face formal discipline. Even so, the Publisher/Author Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the \nbook restrictions in Senate File 496 due to the alleged impact on their First Amendment rights. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that authors and publishers have standing to challenge \nregulations  that  prohibit  them  from  reaching  their  intended  audience  or  impose  financial \ndisincentives on their work. See Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 408 (1989) (holding that \npublishers had standing to challenge prison regulations limiting access to written materials); \nSimon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 116 (1991) \n(explaining  that  publishers  and  authors  are  interchangeable  with  respect  to  making  First \nAmendment challenge to statutory restrictions on book profits). Both are present here.  \nThe Publisher/Author Plaintiffs also have standing because they are โstigmatizedโ by the \nremoval of their books from public school libraries in Iowa. Elected officials in Iowa have \ncharacterized Senate File 496 as being designed, in relevant part, to remove โpornographyโ from \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 18 of 46\nschools. The Publisher/Author Plaintiffs insist, however, that their books are not โpornographyโ \nand that any discussion of sex acts instead serves an important literary purpose like helping \nexplain a characterโs social or emotional development or sending a message about sexual assault, \nbullying, or other topics of pedagogical importance to students. Under Eighth Circuit precedent, \nthe stigma associated with these works being banned from schools is a standalone basis for \nstanding. See Turkish Coal. of Am., Inc. v. Bruininks, 678 F.3d 617, 622โ23 (8th Cir. 2012) \n(holding that organization had standing due to stigma associated with its website being labeled \nโunreliableโ and included on the same list as websites denying the Holocaust); see also Meese v. \nKeene,  481  U.S.  465,  467  (1987)  (holding  that  state  senator  had  standing  to  raise  First \nAmendment claim due to potential impact of law on his โpersonal, political, and professional \nreputationโ). \n3.  Student Plaintiffs. \nOne Plaintiff in the Penguin House case and eight Plaintiffs in the GLBT Youth case are \nstudents. The Penguin House Student Plaintiff, Hailie Bonz, is a senior at Urbandale High \nSchool and sues through her father as โnext friend.โ (Penguin House Docket ECF 1, ยถ 26.) She \nhas standing to challenge the โage-appropriateโ book restrictions in Senate File 496 because they \ndirectly limit the books and materials she can obtain from the school library. She does not \nchallenge the restrictions on programs, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity and \nsexual orientation, nor does she challenge the parental notification requirements.  \nThe  GLBT  Youth  Student  Plaintiffs  include  one  elementary  school  student  (fourth \ngrade), two middle school students (eighth grade), and five high school students, all of whom sue \nthrough their parents as โnext friends.โ (GLBT Youth Docket ECF 1, ยถยถ 11โ18.) They have \nstanding to challenge the โage-appropriateโ book restrictions in Senate File 496 for the same \nreason as Hailie Bonz. \nThe  GLBT  Youth  Student  Plaintiffs  also  challenge  the  restrictions  on  programs, \npromotion, and instruction relating to gender identity and sexual orientation, as well as the \nparental notification requirements. The GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs allege that these aspects \nof Senate File 496 have caused them to โclose[] off forms of expression in which they used to \nengage.โ (GLBT Youth Docket ECF 2-1, p. 12.) For example, they are โmore reluctant to be \nโoutโ about their identities at school,โ โwear clothing that fits their identity or acknowledges \n[their gender identity or sexual orientation],โ ask teachers and fellow students to use preferred \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 19 of 46\nnames and pronouns, or otherwise engage in forms of expression. (Id.) Even students with \nsupportive  families  have  felt  more  isolated  and  hopeless  at  school.  (Id.,  pp.  12โ13.).  An \norganization called GLBT Youth in Iowa Schools Task Force (d/b/a โIowa Safe Schoolsโ) is also \na Plaintiff in the GLBT Youth case. (GLBT Youth Docket ECF 1, ยถ 8; see also id., p. 2.) It is a \nnot-for-profit organization based in Des Moines, Iowa, that provides resources and support for \nstudents throughout Iowa. (Id., ยถ 8.) It serves at least 4,000 students representing over 100 \nGender Sexuality Alliances (โGSAsโ) in school districts across the state. (Id., ยถ 9.)  \nThe GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the provisions of \nSenate File 496 requiring teachers and other licensed professionals to notify parents when a \nstudent has asked to have an โaccommodationโ relating to gender identity, such as the use of a \ndifferent name or pronoun. All GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs report that they are already โoutโ \nto their parents, families, and/or schools, and thus none of them are directly affected by this \nfeature of the law. (GLBT Youth Docket, ECF 2-2; ECF 2-3; ECF 2-4; ECF 2-5; ECF 2-6; ECF \n2-7; ECF 2-9.) Instead, at most, they simply allege that the parental notification requirement \ncontributes to the overall perception that the law targets the LGBTQ+ student community. This \nis not the type of concrete injury that confers standing. See, e.g., City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95, 107 n.8 (1983) (explaining that standing requires real threats, not โsubjective \napprehensionsโ). The Court therefore will not engage in further analysis of the constitutionality \nof the parental notification requirements. The Court has no authority to enjoin them.  \nMost  of  the  GLBT  Youth  Student  Plaintiffs  also  lack  standing  to  challenge  the \nrestrictions in Senate File 496 on programs, promotion, and instruction relating to gender identity \nand sexual orientation in grade six and below. The injuries they have experiencedโsuch as \nfeeling โclosed offโ or uncomfortable revealing their true identities at schoolโare based on a \nmisunderstanding  of  the  law.  Nothing  in  Senate  File  496  prohibits  them  from  expressing \nthemselves at school in the same manner they would have before the law was enacted. At most, \nthe GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs have been harmed by their perception of the law rather than \nits actual language. Standing does not exist in these circumstances. See Republican Party of \nMinn.,  Third  Cong.  Dist.  v.  Klobuchar,  381  F.3d  785,  792โ93  (8th  Cir.  2004)  (affirming \ndismissal of First Amendment claim for lack of standing where the only alleged โchilling effectโ \nwas on speech that was not forbidden by the statute). \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 20 of 46\nConsider, for example, the GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffsโ argument that Senate File \n496 makes them concerned about asking for support or guidance from high school teachers, \nwhom the Student Plaintiffs fear will get into trouble if they assist LGBTQ+ students. While the \nCourt does not doubt the sincerity of these concerns, they do not emanate from the language of \nthe statute. There is no restriction in Senate File 496 on the ability of school districts, teachers, \nand other professionals to provide programs, promotion, and/or instruction relating to gender \nidentity and sexual orientation to students in grade seven and above. School districts may, for \nexample, offer GSAs that provide resources and support for LGBTQ+ students in those grades. \nIndeed, it likely would be unconstitutional for a school district not to allow such GSAs in the \nsame manner as any other student club for grades seven and above. Similarly, teachers and other \nlicensed professionals are not restricted in any way from serving as advisors for such GSAs, \ndisplaying rainbow flags, providing instruction on gay and transgender rights, and otherwise \nperforming their  responsibilities in a manner that emphasizes inclusiveness and  respect for \nLGBTQ+ students in grades seven and above. The GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs themselves \nare similarly free to be โoutโ at school, join GSAs, communicate their support for LGBTQ+ \nrights,  and  otherwise  do  and  say  what  they  wish  on  topics  of  gender  identity  and  sexual \norientation. To the extent the GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs in grades seven and above are \ninterpreting the law as forbidding such activities, they are incorrect. It follows that the GLBT \nYouth Student Plaintiffs in grades seven and above (which is all but one of the GLBT Youth \nStudent Plaintiffs) do not have standing to challenge the restrictions on programs, promotion, \nand instruction relating to gender identity and sexual orientation. See Klobuchar, 381 F.3d at \n792โ93; see also Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13 (1972) (plaintiffs lacked standing to raise First \nAmendment challenge where alleged injuries merely included perception that government action \nwas improper and โspeculative apprehensivenessโ for how they might be affected).  \nOnly one GLBT Youth Student Plaintiff, A.C., is in grade six or below and therefore \ndirectly affected by the restrictions in Senate File 496 on programs, promotion, and instruction \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation. As a fourth grader, those restrictions squarely \napply in A.C.โs classroom and thus place her in a different position than all other GLBT Youth \nStudent Plaintiffs. Still, the State Defendants argue that Senate File 496 does not limit A.C.โs \nfree  speech  rights  because  the  penalty  provisions  only  apply  to  teachers  or  other  licensed \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 21 of 46\npractitioners.  In  other  words,  they  argue,  A.C.  cannot  be  โpunishedโ  for  saying  or  doing \nanything. \nThe  Court  concludes,  for  three  reasons,  that  A.C.  nonetheless  has  standing.  First, \nalthough Senate  File 496 does not mention penalties against students, students nonetheless \nremain subject to generally applicable disciplinary policies and procedures. These policies and \nprocedures  must,  among  other  things,  โprovide  opportunities  for  students  to  exercise  self-\ndiscipline and practice cooperative classroom behavior.โ Iowa Code ยง 279.66. If A.C. tried to \nexpress herself in the classroom as being transgender, give a presentation on transgender rights, \nor ask questions about the gender identity or sexual orientation of a bookโs characters, this would \ndisrupt the class by raising topics that the teacher could not allow the class to discuss. If the \ndisruption was pervasive enough, this could lead to a verbal admonishment, trip to the principalโs \noffice, or some other form of discipline for A.C. This is enough to establish standing. See \nParents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 666 (potential for discipline on the basis of speech is \nsufficient to establish standing) \nSecond, regardless of who can be punished for violating the law, Senate File 496 forces \nstudents  like  A.C.  to  engage  in  self-censorship.  Unless  she  was  intentionally  trying  to  be \ndisruptive (which, again, would lead to potential discipline in its own right), it would be pointless \nfor A.C. to bring up a subject like gender identity or sexual orientation in the classroom that she \nknows the teacher cannot discuss or allow other students to discuss. Thus, โthe alleged danger of \nthis statute is, in large measure, one of self-censorship; a harm that can be realized even without \nan actual prosecution.โ Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Assโn, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988); see \nalso Parents, Fams., & Friends of Lesbians & Gays, Inc. v. Camdenton R-III Sch. Dist., 853 F. \nSupp. 2d 888, 897 (W.D. Mo. 2012) (concluding that student had standing to sue based on \nchilling effect of school district regulation).  \nThird,  because  section  279.80  prohibits  โpromotionโ  of  gender  identity  or  sexual \norientation for students in grade six and below, a reasonable school district could interpret it as \nforbidding students in those grades, such as A.C., from being allowed to join GSAs and other \nstudent organizations designed to provide support for transgender and gay students. This, in turn, \nimpairs A.C.โs First Amendment right to free speech in the form of freedom of expressive \nassociation. See, e.g., Gay & Lesbian Students Assโn v. Gohn, 850 F.2d 361, 368 (8th Cir. 1988). \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 22 of 46\nA.C. therefore has standing to challenge the restrictions on programs, promotion, and instruction \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation. See id.   \n4.  Standing: Summary. \nIn summary, the Court concludes: (i) all Penguin House Plaintiffs and all GLBT Youth \nPlaintiffs have standing to challenge the book restrictions in Senate File 496; (ii) the Educator \nPlaintiffs (Gutmann, Abry, Browder, and ISEA) in the Penguin House case have standing to \nchallenge the restrictions in Senate File 496 on programs, promotion, and instruction relating to \ngender  identity  and  sexual  orientation;  (iii)  one  GLBT  Youth  Student  Plaintiff,  A.C.,  has \nstanding to challenge the restrictions in Senate File 496 on programs, promotion, and instruction \nrelating to gender identity and sexual orientation; and (iv) no GLBT Youth Student Plaintiffs \nhave standing to challenge the parental notification requirements in Senate File 496.  \nV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS: THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SENATE FILE 496 AS IT \nRELATES TO SCHOOL LIBRARY PROGRAMS. \nTo evaluate the constitutionality of Senate File 496, it is important to start by identifying \nthe constitutional rights at issue. Broadly speaking, all parties agree that the cases revolve in \nlarge part around the First Amendment. Beyond this broad agreement, however, the parties \ndisagree on the proper formulation of the specific rights at issue; i.e., the First Amendment right \nto do what? The parties further disagree on the appropriate standard that must be applied. The \nCourt  therefore  must  begin  by:  (i)  identifying  the  constitutional  rights  implicated  by  the \nchallenges to each of the provisions of Senate File 496; and (ii) determining the governing \nstandard for evaluating the lawโs constitutionality. As explained below, existing Supreme Court \nand Eighth Circuit precedent provide helpful guidance in some ways but very little clarity in \nothers. The most enduring lesson appears to be that there is no single standard of scrutiny that \napplies to restrictions on First Amendment rights in the school setting; instead, there is a sliding \nscale that varies according to context. \nA.  The Book Restrictions in Senate File 496 Implicate Constitutional Issues in At Least \nThree Ways, Each With its Own Level of Scrutiny. \nAs it relates to book restrictions in school libraries, there are at least three different forms \nof constitutional analysis that must be undertaken, only one of which is governed by a clear \nstandard under existing Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit precedent. For reasons explained \nbelow, the Court concludes that the issues and governing standards are as follows: First, the \nStudent Plaintiffs have the First Amendment right to receive information in school libraries free \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 23 of 46\nfrom suppression based on viewpoint, ideology, or other reasons amounting to the suppression of \nideas. The constitutionality of the book restrictions in Senate File 496 depends on whether the \nState Defendants have shown a โsubstantial and reasonable governmental interestโ for those \nrestrictions. Second, the Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs have affirmative First \nAmendment free speech rights that require the Court to decide whether Senate File 496 is \noverbroad.  The  applicable  standard  of  scrutiny  is  unclear  but  somewhat  higher  than  the \nโsubstantial and reasonable governmental interestโ test and must take into account the extent to \nwhich  the  โage-appropriateโ  standard  in  Senate  File  496  deviates  from  the  definition  of \nโobscenityโ for adults, as reasonably adjusted for minors. Third, the Educator Plaintiffs have the \nFourteenth Amendment due process right to be free from laws that are so vague that a person of \nordinary intelligence does not have fair notice of what is prohibited.  \n1.  The Student Plaintiffs Have a First Amendment Right to Receive Information \nin  School  Libraries,  But  This  Right  May  Be  Limited  When  There  Is  a \nโSubstantial and Reasonable Governmental Interest.โ \nThe Student Plaintiffs in the Penguin House and GLBT Youth cases assert, first, that they \nhave  a  constitutional  right  to  receive  information  through  their  school  libraries.  The  State \nDefendants deny that any such constitutional right exists and argue, in any event, that Senate File \n496 does not violate it. The Court agrees with the Student Plaintiffs that they have a First \nAmendment right to receive information in the circumstances presented here.   \nThe Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit have  each  addressed the constitutionality of \nrestrictions on access to books and other materials in school libraries: the former in Board of \nEducation, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), and the \nlatter in Pratt v. Independent School District No. 831, Forest Lake, Minnesota, 670 F.2d 771 (8th \nCir. 1982). In Pico, a local school board ordered the removal of nine books from school libraries \nbased on the boardโs belief that the content of the books did not match their โconservative \neducational philosophyโ and were โirrelevant, vulgar, immoral, and in bad taste.โ 457 U.S. at \n859 (plurality opinion). The Supreme Court was asked to decide whether the school boardโs \nactions violated the studentsโ First Amendment rights. \nThe  Supreme  Courtโs  decision  was  fractured,  with  a  three-justice  plurality  opinion \nconcluding  the  boardโs  actions  would  violate  the  First  Amendment  if  the  board  members \nremoved the books โsimply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by \ntheir removal to โprescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 24 of 46\nmatters of opinion.โโ Id. at 872 (plurality opinion) (quoting W. Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 \nU.S. 624, 642 (1943)). A fourth justice mostly agreed with the plurality opinion but offered a \nโsomewhat different perspective on the nature of the First Amendment right involved,โ namely, \nthat โthe State may not suppress exposure to ideasโfor the sole purpose of suppressing exposure \nto those ideasโabsent sufficiently compelling reasons.โ Id. at 877 (Blackmun, J., concurring). In \ndissent, four justices concluded that the First Amendment does not encompass โa right to have \nparticular books retained on the school library shelf.โ Id. at 888 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Three \nof those same dissenting justices also recognized, however, that school boards may not exercise \ntheir discretion to โdetermine the content of their school libraries . . . in a narrowly partisan or \npolitical manner.โ Id. at 907 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Finally, one justiceโthe deciding voteโ\nconcluded the Court should not decide the constitutional question at all and instead should \nsimply remand for trial. Id. at 883 (White, J., concurring in the judgment). Despite not having the \nsupport of any of his colleagues, Justice Whiteโs concurring opinion carried the day and resulted \nin remand.  \nNotwithstanding the splintered nature of the decision, Pico provides some guidance that \nremains applicable today. Almost all the justices concluded that school boards can violate the \nConstitution in some circumstances when making decisions about whether to remove books from \nthe school library. Indeed, then-Justice Rehnquist, in an otherwise forceful dissent, โcheerfully \nconcede[d]โ that school boards would violate the Constitution if they removed all books โwritten \nby or in favor of Republicansโ or โan all-white school board, motivated by racial animus, \ndecided to remove all books authored by blacks or advocating racial equality and integration. \nOur Constitution does not permit the official suppression of ideas.โ Id. at 907 (Rehnquist, J., \nconcurring) (quoting id. at 871 (plurality opinion)). In addition, โall Members of the Court, \notherwise sharply divided, acknowledged that the school board has the authority to remove \nbooks that are vulgar.โ Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 684 (1986) (discussing \nPico). Beyond these areas of agreement, however, it would be difficult to apply Pico without \nadditional guidance.  \nFortunately, Pico does not stand alone in the universe of precedential cases involving the \nremoval of books from school libraries. In Pratt, the Eighth Circuit addressed the same issue, \nstating:  \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 25 of 46\nThere has been a flurry of cases recently in which the federal courts have \nconsidered First Amendment challenges to the removal of books from \nlibraries. Those courts have generally concluded that a cognizable First \nAmendment  claim  exists  if  the  book  was  excluded  to  suppress  an \nideological  or  religious  viewpoint  with  which  the  local  authorities \ndisagreed . . . We believe that this focus provides the proper framework \nfor analysis here. \n670 F.2d at 776. Pratt held that โto avoid a finding that it acted unconstitutionally, the board \nmust establish that a substantial and reasonable governmental interest exists for interfering with \nthe studentsโ right to receive information.โ Id. at 777. โAt the very least, the First Amendment \nprecludes local authorities from imposing a โpall of orthodoxyโ on classroom instruction which \nimplicates the state in the propagation of a particular religious or ideological viewpoint.โ Id. at \n776. Based on Pico and Pratt, the Court concludes that: (a) the Student Plaintiffs have a First \nAmendment right not to have books and materials removed from the school library based on \nideological,  religious,  or  other  grounds  designed  to  suppress  ideas  or  impose  a  โpall  of \northodoxyโ over the classroom; and (b) the State must establish a โsubstantial and reasonable \ngovernmental interestโ that justifies the school library restrictions. See Pratt, 670 F.2d at 776โ77; \nsee also Campbell v. St. Tammany Par. Sch. Bd., 64 F.3d 184, 189 (5th Cir. 1995) (applying \nโgreater scrutinyโ to school boardโs decision to remove books than would apply in a decision \ninvolving school curriculum).  \n2.  The Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs Have First Amendment \nFree Speech Rights Against Overbroad Restrictions. \n  In addition to asking the Court to apply Pico and Pratt, the GLBT Youth Plaintiffs and \nPenguin House Plaintiffs urge the Court to evaluate the book restrictions in Senate File 496 \npursuant to the overbreadth doctrine and with reference to the adult โobscenityโ standard, as \nadjusted for minors. โ[A] law may be invalidated as overbroad if โa substantial number of its \napplications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statuteโs plainly legitimate sweep.โโ \nUnited States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010) (quoting Wash. St. Grange v. Wash. St. \nRepub. Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 n.6 (2008)). โInvalidation for overbreadth is โstrong medicineโ \nthat is not to be casually employed.โ United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 293 (2008) (some \ninternal punctuation omitted).  \n  To determine the appropriate standard for the overbreadth challenge, it is necessary to \nevaluate  whose  First  Amendment  rights  are  at  issue,  and  what  those  rights  are.  For  the \nPublisher/Author Plaintiffs, this is a straightforward task. Their First Amendment free speech \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 26 of 46\nrights are impaired when a state law limits their ability to reach their intended audience based on \nthe content of their speech. See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 408. Their rights are similarly impaired \nwhen a law stigmatizes their reputations by implying that their books are pornographic or \notherwise unsuitable for the target audience. See Bruininks, 678 F.3d at 622โ23. The overbreadth \nanalysis  for  the  Publisher/Author  Plaintiffs  therefore  emanates  from  their  affirmative  First \nAmendment free speech rights.   \n  It is less clear whether Senate File 496 impairs the affirmative free speech rights of the \nStudent Plaintiffs, although the Court concludes that it does. The State Defendants insist that \nstudents may read and discuss any of the books in question in school; they simply must obtain \nthem somewhere other than the school library. The Court does not read the law so narrowly. As \namended by Senate File 496, the unnumbered introductory paragraph of Iowa Code ยง 256.11 \nโrequire[s]โ schools to implement an educational program that โshall be taught from an age-\nappropriate, multicultural, and gender-fair approach.โ By using the words โrequireโ and โage-\nappropriate,โ the Legislature has tied in the definition of โage-appropriateโ from Senate File 496 \nin a way that appears to prohibit teachers and students from using books that depict โsex actsโ in \nany aspect of the curriculum at any grade level. See Iowa Code ยง 256.11(19) (defining โage-\nappropriateโ). Or, at least, this is how a reasonably cautious school district or teacher would \ninterpret the law. See Parents Defending Education, 83 F.4th at 668โ69 (rejecting school boardโs \nargument about the purportedly narrow scope of a policy because โthe plain meaning of the \npolicy is not so limitedโ). If so, a student likely would be prohibited from using a book that \ncontains a โsex actโ for a book report, essay, or other project. This, in turn, will limit the \nstudentโs ability to โengage in an โopen exchange of ideasโ and to express beliefs that others \nmight find disagreeable or offensive.โ Id. at 667; see also Camdenton R-III Sch. Dist., 853 F. \nSupp. 2d at 897 (finding standing where regulation had chilling effect on student speech).  \nThe next question is what standard of scrutiny the Court should apply. The answer is \nunclear because the Supreme Court has never settled on a single, governing standard for First \nAmendment challenges in school settings. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community \nSchool District, for example, the Supreme Court held that schools could not restrict student \nspeech unless the speech would โmaterially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of \nthe school.โ 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). In later cases, however, the Supreme Court emphasized \nthat the โmode of analysis set forth in Tinker is not absoluteโ and โthe constitutional rights of \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 27 of 46\nstudents in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other \nsettings.โ Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 404โ05 (2007). In two of the most recent school \nFirst Amendment cases, the Supreme Court conspicuously declined to endorse any particular \nstandard of scrutiny. See id. at 404 (โWe need not resolve this debate [about the appropriate level \nof scrutiny] to decide this case.โ); see also Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L. by & through Levy, \n141 S. Ct. 2038, 2047โ48 (2021). As relevant here, the main takeaway from these cases is that \nthere is no one-size-fits-all standard for school-related First Amendment challenges.  \n  Senate File 496 is a perfect illustration for why the Supreme Court has been unable to \nsettle on a single standard of scrutiny in the school setting. On the surfaceโand as discussed in \nthe preceding sectionโSenate File 496 resembles cases like Pico and Pratt because it involves \nrestrictions on the contents of school libraries. Hence the Courtโs conclusion above that it should \napply the โsubstantial and reasonable governmental interestโ test from Pratt. Closer review, \nhowever,  shows  a  gaping  difference  between  the  Pico/Pratt  line  of  cases  and  the  book \nrestrictions in Senate File 496. This difference causes the Court to conclude that Senate File 496 \nalso must be evaluated under a separate and somewhat more burdensome level of scrutiny as it \nrelates to the free speech rights of the Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs.  \n  The Court reaches this conclusion because Pico and Pratt each involved one school \nboardโs decision to remove a small number of materialsโnine books in Pico, 457 U.S. at 858, \nand a single film (plus a trailer for the same film) in Pratt, 670 F.2d at 773. Other reported cases \nemanating from Pico similarly involve the removal of a small number of books or materials by a \nlocal school board. See, e.g., Am. C.L. Union of Fla., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., 557 \nF.3d 1177 (11th Cir. 1995) (one book); Campbell, 64 F.3d at 185 (one book); Bicknell v. \nVergennes Union High Sch. Bd. of Directors, 638 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1980) (two books); Zykan v. \nWarsaw Cmty. Sch. Corp., 631 F.2d 1300, 1308 (7th Cir. 1980) (one book); Cary v. Bd. of Ed. of \nAdams-Arapahoe Sch. Dist. 28-J, Aurora, Colo., 598 F.2d 535 (10th Cir. 1979) (ten books); \nC.K.-W. by & through T.K. v. Wentzville R-IV Sch. Dist., 619 F. Supp. 3d 906, 910 (E.D. Mo. \n2022) (eight books); Virgil v. Sch. Bd. of Columbia Cnty., Fla., 677 F. Supp. 1547 (M.D. Fla. \n1988) (one textbook); Salvail v. Nashua Bd. of Ed., 469 F. Supp. 1269 (D.N.H. 1979) (one \nmagazine). One of the recurring tensions in these cases is whether and to what extent federal \njudges  should  get  into the  business  of  reviewing  ad  hoc  decisions  by  local  school  boards \nregarding the removal of individual books from school libraries. See, e.g., Pico, 457 U.S. at 890โ\n27 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 28 of 46\n91 (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (โDiscretion must be used, and the appropriate body to exercise that \ndiscretion is the local elected school board, not judges . . . [L]ocal control of education involves \ndemocracy in a microcosm. In most public schools in the United States the parents have a large \nvoice in running the school.โ). \nHere, by contrast, the evidence shows that the Iowa Legislature enacted Senate File 496 \nbecause local school boards would not remove books from school libraries. (See, e.g., Penguin \nHouse  Docket  ECF  45-1,  pp.  47โ48,  50โ59,  73โ76.)  In  other  words,  the  Legislature  was \ndissatisfied  with  local  decision-making  by  local  officials  and  decided  an  across-the-board \nsolution was necessary for a problem that local school boards apparently did not believe existed \nin the first place. The result is a statewide law that has thus far been interpreted as requiring the \nremoval of, collectively, more than 500 books. (See Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14.) Senate \nFile 496 sweeps so broadly that Iowa school districts have, by way of example, removed:   \nโข  historical classics like As I Lay Dying (William Faulkner), Ulysses \n(James Joyce), Brave New World (Aldous Huxley), The Picture of \nDorian Gray (Oscar Wilde), and Native Son (Richard Wright);  \nโข  modern award-winners like I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (Maya \nAngelou),  Song  of  Solomon,  Beloved,  and  The  Bluest  Eye  (Toni \nMorrison), The Kite Runner (Khaled Hosseini), Nineteen Minutes (Jodi \nPicoult),  Speak  and  Shout  (Laurie  Halse  Anderson),  Looking  for \nAlaska and The Fault in Our Stars (John Michael Green), and Last \nNight at the Telegraph Club (Malinda Lo);  \nโข  non-fiction books designed to help minors avoid being victimized by \nsexual assault, Sexual Predators (Laurie Willis, ed.), and The Truth \nAbout Rape (Robert Golden, ed.);  \nโข  non-fiction history books about the Holocaust, Night (Elie Wiesel), \nand the massacre of innocent civilians in China in the early stages of \nWorld War II, The Rape of Nanking (Iris Chang);  \nโข  non-fiction books about how to make safe and informed decisions \nabout sex, Making Sexual Decisions (L. Kris Gowen); and \nโข  dozens (if not hundreds) of other works of fiction geared toward the \nemotional and intellectual challenges associated with being a junior \nhigh school or high school student.  \n(Penguin House Docket ECF 34-14.) The State Defendants have not identified, nor has the Court \nbeen able to locate, a single case upholding school library restrictions as broad as those set forth \nin Senate File 496. In essence, the Iowa Legislature has used a bulldozer where school boards in \nprior cases merely employed a scalpel. \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 29 of 46\n  Against this backdrop, it is difficult to conclude that the mode of analysis in the Pico line \nof cases is the exclusiveโor even most appropriateโmethod for evaluating the constitutionality \nof Senate File 496. Indeed, Pico contemplates that courts will analyze the subjective motivations \nof each school board member to determine why individual books were removed from a school \nlibrary. See, e.g., Campbell, 64 F.3d at 190. This is very difficult in the context of a statewide \nlaw enacted through the votes of more than one hundred legislators and resulting in the removal \nof more than 500 books. There could be one hundred different answers for why each of the 500 \nbooks was removed.  \nThe Court therefore agrees with the Penguin House Plaintiffs that the analysis must go \nbeyond Pico and take into account Supreme Court precedent from related First Amendment \nareas, including, especially, the obscenity doctrine. In Miller v. California, the Supreme Court \ndefined โobscenityโ as โworks which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, \nwhich portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not \nhave serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.โ 413 U.S. 15, 23โ24 (1973). The \nPenguin House Plaintiffs correctly admit that school districts have greater freedom to remove \nbooks from school libraries and curricula than just those that meet the adult obscenity standard. \nSee Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988) (โ[T]he First Amendment \nrights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults \nin other settings . . . and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school \nenvironment.โ (internal punctuation and citations omitted)). In other words, the Iowa Legislature \nwas not constitutionally required to adopt the adult obscenity standard in Senate File 496. \nAll  the  same,  the  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  recognized  that  laws  imposing \nrestrictions on the availability of materials for minors must be at least somewhat tethered to the \nadult obscenity standard. For example, in Ginsberg v. State of New York, the Supreme Court \nupheld a New York law prohibiting bookstores from selling certain books to minors. 390 U.S. \n629 (1968). The law used a watered-down version of the then-prevailing adult definition of \nโobscenity,โ  with  the  restrictions  limited  to  books  with  โnudity,  sexual  conduct,  sexual \nexcitement, or sadomasochistic abuse [that] (i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful \nor morbid interest of minors, and (ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult \ncommunity as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and (iii) is utterly \nwithout redeeming social importance for minors.โ Id. at 646 (emphasis added). Ginsberg held \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 30 of 46\nthat it was permissible for a state to โadjust[] the definition of obscenity โto social realities by \npermitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests . . . of \nsuch minors.โโ Id. at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. State of N.Y., 383 U.S. 502, 509 (1966)).  \nLater Supreme Court cases have repeatedly attached significance to the fact that Ginsberg \nstarted with the adult definition of โobscenityโ when determining which materials could not be \nmade available to minors. In Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, for example, the Supreme Court \nstruck down a city ordinance prohibiting films with nudity from being shown in drive-in theaters. \n422 U.S. 205 (1975). Erznoznik rejected the cityโs argument that the ordinance was designed to \nprotect against the possibility of minors viewing the films, holding that โ[c]learly all nudity \ncannot be deemed obscene even as to minors.โ See id. at 213 n.10. Erznoznik suggested the \nGinsberg standardโwhich is characterized as a โvariation of the adult obscenity standardsโโ\nwould  have  been  a  more  appropriate  mechanism  for  protecting  against  First  Amendment \nconcerns than an across-the-board prohibition with no room for nuance. See id. Similarly, in \nReno  v.  American  Civil  Liberties  Union,  the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  portions  of  the \nCommunications Decency Act on First Amendment grounds, in part because the law did not \nadopt the Ginsberg  standard or otherwise allow for consideration of whether the restricted \nmaterials had serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 521 U.S. 844, 865 (1997). \nFinally, in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, the Supreme Court reiterated the \nimportance of โadjust[ing] the definition of obscenityโ as it relates to minors as opposed to \ndispensing  with  the  definition  altogether.  564 U.S.  786,  794  (2011). Brown  explained  that \nโ[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription \ncannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body \nthinks unsuitable for them.โ Id. at 795 (quoting Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 213โ14).  \nGinsberg, Erznoznik, Reno, and Brown recognize a sort of โobscenity-lightโ standard for \nminors that must be considered when a legislature enacts a law with sweeping implications on \nthe ability of minors to access books or other materials. Given that Senate File 496 is a statewide \nlaw  with  across-the-board  implications  for  publishers,  authors,  teachers,  and  studentsโas \nopposed to an isolated decision about an individual book by a local school boardโthe Court \nconcludes  that  the  obscenity-light  standard  must  play  a  role  in  deciding  whether  the  book \nrestrictions in Senate File 496 comply with the First Amendment. The closer Senate File 496 \ncomes to the obscenity-light standard, the more likely it is to pass constitutional muster.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 31 of 46\n3.  The  Educator  Plaintiffs  Have  the  Due  Process  Right  to  Fair  Notice  of \nProhibited Conduct.   \nThe final constitutional question is whether the book restrictions in Senate File 496 are \nvoid for vagueness in violation of the due process rights of the Educator Plaintiffs, who are \nsubject to discipline if they violate the age-appropriate standard. Unlike the other constitutional \nquestions, the governing legal principles are clear: a statute โis unconstitutionally vague if it fails \nto  โprovide  adequate  notice  of  the  proscribed  conductโ  and  lends  โitself  to  arbitrary \nenforcement.โโ Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 668 (quoting United States v. Barraza, 576 \nF.3d 798, 806 (8th Cir. 2009)). School policies โneed not be as detailed as a criminal code that \nimposes criminal sanctions.โ Id. โBut when a school policy reaches speech protected by the First \nAmendment, the vagueness doctrine โdemands a greater degree of specificity than in other \ncontexts.โโ Id. (quoting Stephenson v. Davenport Comm. Sch. Dist., 110 F.3d 1303, 1308โ09 (8th \nCir. 1997)). โAs such, โwhile a lesser standard of scrutiny is appropriate because of the public \nschool setting, a proportionately greater level of scrutiny is required because the regulation \nreaches the exercise of free speech.โโ Id. (quoting Stephenson, 110 F.3d at 1308โ09). \n4.  The School Library Restrictions in Senate File 496 Are Not โGovernment \nSpeech.โ \nBefore turning to the merits, one other issue warrants attention. The State Defendants \nurge the Court not to apply any of the standards described above, but rather to treat the book \nrestrictions in Senate File 496 as a form of โgovernment speechโ for which no First Amendment \nrights are implicated at all. See People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. Gittens, 414 \nF.3d 23, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (โThe First Amendmentโs Free Speech Clause does not limit the \ngovernment as speaker.โ). The State Defendantsโ position arises largely out of the Supreme \nCourtโs plurality opinion in United States v. American Library Association, Inc., which held that \na public library is not a โtraditionalโ or โdesignatedโ public forum for First Amendment purposes \nand therefore does not need to satisfy heightened constitutional scrutiny when deciding which \ncontent to include in a collection. 539 U.S. 194, 205 (2003) (โPublic library staffs necessarily \nconsider content in making collection decisions and enjoy broad discretion in making them.โ); \nsee also Gittens, 414 F.3d at 28 (โWith respect to the public library, the government speaks \nthrough its selection of which books to put on the shelves and which books to exclude.โ).  \nThere are several problems with the State Defendantsโ argument. First, Pico, Pratt, and \nother cases recognize that the removal of books from a school library is different for First \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 32 of 46\nAmendment  purposes  than  the  acquisition  of  books.  See  Pratt,  670  F.2d  at  776 \n(โNotwithstanding  the  power  and  discretion  accorded  them,  school  boards  do  not  have  an \nabsolute right to remove materials from the curriculum.โ); Fayetteville Pub. Lib. v. Crawford \nCnty., Ark., No. 5:23-CV-05086, 2023 WL 4845636, at *20 (W.D. Ark. July 29, 2023) (โSetting \naside Pico, Defendants are unable to cite any legal precedent to suggest that the state may censor \nnon-obscene materials in a public library because such censorship is a form of government \nspeech.โ). As binding Eighth Circuit precedent, the Court cannot ignore Pratt without clear \nguidance from a higher court that it is no longer good law. None of the cases cited by the State \nDefendants provide that level of clarity.  \nSecond, the fact that a library is not a โtraditionalโ or โdesignatedโ public forum with \nrespect to the selection of content does not mean content decisions are altogether free from First \nAmendment scrutiny. Instead, courts have recognized that libraries are a โlimited public forumโ \nfor which the government may not impose unreasonable or viewpoint-specific restrictions. See \nKreimer v. Bureau of Police for Town of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1261 (3d Cir. 1992); see \nalso Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of the Law v. Martinez, \n561 U.S. 661, 679 n.11 (2010) (describing the standard for a limited public forum). This is \nsimilarโif not identicalโto the โsubstantial and reasonable governmental interestโ standard \napplied in Pratt.  \nThird, Am. Libr. Assโn involved Internet filtering restrictions imposed by Congress on \npublic  libraries  that  receive  federal  assistance.  The  case  therefore  addressed  the  limits  on \nCongressโs spending power, not limits on the regulation of private conduct. 539 U.S. at 209 n. 4. \nMoreover, library patrons in Am. Libr. Assโn had the ability to access the restricted content; all \nthey needed to do was ask to have the filtering technology turned off. Id. at 209. Indeed, the \ndecisive fifth vote came from Justice Kennedy, whose concurring opinion was based entirely on \nthis  fact.  See  id.  at  215  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring)  (holding  that  the  โlegitimate,  and  even \ncompellingโ  interest  in  protecting  minors  from  pornography  was  sufficient  to  sustain  the \nconstitutionality of the law given that adult access to the filtered material was not โburdened in \nany significant degreeโ). Justice Breyer also concurred in the result, stating that he believed an \nintermediate level of scrutiny should apply. Id. at 216 (Breyer, J., concurring) (โI would apply a \nform of heightened scrutiny, examining the statutory requirements in question with special \ncare.โ) \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 33 of 46\nHere, by contrast, there is no process for students to obtain from the school library books \nthat Senate File 496 has declared off limits. There is not, for example, a sealed section of the \nschool library that students can access if they have parental consent. To the contrary, school \nlibrarians and teachers would face discipline for making such books available to students under \nany circumstances. Moreover, Senate File 496 limits the affirmative free speech rights of the \nStudent Plaintiffs by limiting what can be discussed in the school setting. This makes Senate File \n496 substantially different from the spending-related restrictions upheld in Am. Libr. Assโn.   \nFourth, and finally, even if the Court adopted the State Defendantsโ position that the \nselection of books in a school library constitutes โgovernment speech,โ Senate File 496 still \nwould have to be evaluated under the vagueness doctrine. For purposes of a void for vagueness \nclaim, the conduct  in question โneed  not be  grounded in [First Amendment] constitutional \nprotections because the claim is based on adequate notice of proscribed behavior.โ Stephenson, \n110 F.3d at 1307.  \nIn sum, the Court declines to treat the book restrictions in Senate File 496 as a form of \ngovernment speech for which no First Amendment scrutiny is appropriate, nor would treating it \nas such resolve the constitutional issues anyway.  \nB.  The  Student  Plaintiffs  Are  Likely  to  Prevail  on  Their  Claims  that  the  Book \nRestrictions in Senate File 496 Violate Pico and Pratt.  \nTurning to the merits, the Court must first evaluate whether the Student Plaintiffs have \nestablished that the book restrictions in Senate File 496 are based on impermissible ideological, \nreligious, or other grounds amounting to the โsuppression of ideasโ or imposition of a โpall of \northodoxyโ over the classroom, or if the State Defendants instead have shown a โsubstantial and \nreasonable governmental interestโ for those restrictions. See Pratt, 670 F.2d at 777. The Court \nconcludes that the Student Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on this issue. \nThe Court reaches this conclusion largely based on Senate File 496โs expansive definition \nof โage-appropriate.โ There very well may be individual books that the Iowa Legislature (or a \nlocal  school  board)  could  remove  from  school  libraries  without  running  afoul  of  the  First \nAmendment due to the bookโs level of vulgarity and the potential for access by younger students. \nSee, e.g., Wentzville R-IV Sch. Dist., 619 F. Supp. 3d at 917 (holding that school librarian did not \nviolate First Amendment by removing three books with sexually explicit content that could have \nbeen viewed by third graders). The problem here, however, is that Senate File 496 makes no \nattempt to target such books in any reasonable way. Instead, it requires the wholesale removal of \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 34 of 46\nevery book containing a description or visual depiction of a โsex act,โ regardless of context. The \nunderlying message is that there is no redeeming value to any such book even if it is a work of \nhistory, self-help guide, award-winning novel, or other piece of serious literature. In effect, the \nLegislature  has  imposed  a  puritanical  โpall  of  orthodoxyโ  over  school  libraries.  This  is \nimpermissible under Pico, Pratt, and similar cases. See Pico, 457 U.S. at 871 (โOur Constitution \ndoes not permit the official suppression of ideas.โ); see also Tinker, 393 U.S. at 511 (โIn our \nsystem, students may not be regarded as closed-circuit recipients of only that which the State \nchooses to communicate.โ).  \nThe State Defendants argue, in part, that the book restrictions do not violate the First \nAmendment because students still can obtain the books from a public library or bookstore; they \nsimply cannot get them through the school library. The Eighth Circuit rejected a nearly identical \nargument in Pratt, holding that โ[r]estraint on protected speech generally cannot be justified by \nthe fact that there may be other times, places or circumstances for such expression.โ 670 F.2d at \n779; see also Reno, 521 U.S. at 880 (โ[O]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of \nexpression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other \nplace.โ) (internal punctuation and citation omitted). The availability of the books through other \nchannels therefore does not save the restrictions in Senate File 496 from constitutional scrutiny. \nSee Counts v. Cedarville Sch. Dist., 295 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1000 (W.D. Ark. 2003) (rejecting \nargument that studentโs ability to access book at home precluded First Amendment challenge to \nschool board regulation).  \nThe State Defendants also argue that the breadth of the book restrictions in Senate File \n496 help it satisfy constitutional muster. At first glance, this is an odd argument: one would not \nordinarily expect the First Amendment to provide weaker protection in the context of broader \nrestrictions. See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 831โ32 (1995) \n(โ[E]xclusion of several views on [a topic] is just as offensive to the First Amendment as the \nexclusion of only one . . . The dissentโs declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple \nvoices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways.โ). Here, however, \nthe State Defendantsโ position is understandable. Pico and Pratt focused largely on whether the \nschool board was trying to suppress a particular viewpoint or idea when it ordered the removal of \na book or material. By contrast, Senate File 496 adopts a definition of โage-appropriateโ that, \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 35 of 46\nalthough broad, does not on its face target any ideology. It simply forbids โsex actsโ for the sake \nof them being โsex acts.โ  \nThe Court returns, however, to the problem of the โpall of orthodoxyโ that Senate File \n496 imposes. The statuteโs broad and unyielding requirement that books be removed whenever \nthey describe or depict a โsex actโ may seem viewpoint-neutral in the sense of not being targeted \ntoward, say, Republicans or Democrats, but it is nonetheless content-specific in the sense of \ncommunicating that no book with a description or visual depiction of a sex act is appropriate for \nminors, regardless of educational or literary value. The fact that the Bible and other religious \ntexts  are  exempted  from  the  law  makes  the problem  even  worse,  as  it  communicates  that \nreligious books with descriptions of sex acts have value after all, while all others do not. This \namounts to โdiscriminat[ion] among [books] solely on the basis of content.โ Erznoznik, 422 U.S. \nat 211 (holding that a ban on all films containing nudity was a content-based restriction); see also \nEpperson v. Ark., 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968) (โThe First Amendment mandates governmental \nneutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.โ). This type of \ndiscrimination is impermissible in the absence of a โsubstantial and reasonable governmental \ninterest.โ Pratt, 670 F.2d at 777.  \nThe State Defendants have presented no evidence that student access to books depicting \nsex acts was creating any significant problems in the school setting, much less to the degree that \nwould give rise to a โsubstantial and reasonable governmental interestโ justifying across-the-\nboard removal. Instead, at most, the State Defendants presented evidence that some parents \nfound the content of a small handful of books to be objectionable. (E.g., Penguin House Docket \nECF 45-1, pp. 50โ59; 89โ106.) This is not enough to justify the removal of not just that small \nhandful of books, but also hundreds of others. See Interactive Digital Software Assโn v. St. Louis \nCnty., Mo., 329 F.3d 954, 959โ60 (8th Cir. 2003) (โNowhere in [its precedent] does the Supreme \nCourt suggest that the governmentโs role in helping parents to be the guardians of their childrenโs \nwell-being is an unbridled license to governments to regulate what minors read and view.โ). The \nStudent Plaintiffs therefore are likely to prevail on their position that Senate File 496 violates \ntheir First Amendment right to receive information in school libraries.  \nC.  The Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prevail on Their \nOverbreadth Challenge to the Book Restrictions in Senate File 496.  \nFor similar reasons, the Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs are likely to \nprevail on their First Amendment overbreadth challenge, which requires the Court to analyze \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 36 of 46\nwhether a โsubstantial numberโ of the applications of Senate File 496 are unconstitutional, \nโjudged in relation to the statuteโs plainly legitimate sweep.โ Stevens, 559 U.S. at 473.  \nโThe  first  step  in  overbreadth  analysis  is  to  construe  the  challenged  statute;  it  is \nimpossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute \ncovers.โ United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 293 (2008). As explained above, Senate File \n496 uses a broad and inflexible definition of โage-appropriateโ and โsex actโ that requires the \nremoval from school libraries of  an extraordinary range of literature.  School districts have \nremoved books about the Holocaust and World War II, works of fiction and nonfiction about or \nby survivors of sexual assault, self-help guides, historical fiction, contemporary fiction, countless \nnovels about the emotional and physical challenges associated with being a teenager or young \nadult, and evenโin the height of ironyโnovels about the dangers of government censorship and \noverreach. The law has a staggeringly broad scope. Even the dictionary and Iowa Code are likely \nprohibited  book.  See  Sexual  Intercourse,  MERRIAM-WEBSTER  ONLINE  DICTIONARY6 \n(โheterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penisโ); Iowa Code ยง \n702.17(1) (โPenetration of the penis into the vagina or anus.โ).  \nMoreover, the definitions of โage-appropriateโ and โsex actโ allow for no consideration \nwhatsoever to be given to a bookโs political, artistic, literary, or scientific value, nor does the law \nallow a school district to consider the age of students who might have access to the book. As the \nPenguin House Plaintiffs correctly point out, Senate File 496 treats a seventeen-year-old high \nschool student like Hailie Bonz (who is beyond the age of consent under Iowa law) the same as a \nfive-year-old in kindergarten. The law therefore comes nowhere close to the one that passed \nconstitutional muster in Ginsberg, which was carefully tethered to the then-prevailing adult \ndefinition of โobscenity,โ as applied to minors. See 390 U.S. at 646; see also Erznoznik; 422 U.S. \nat 213 (striking down city ordinance as overbroad despite possibility that minors would witness \nnudity).  \nThe Iowa Legislature easily could have applied an obscenity-light standard in Senate File \n496.  Indeed,  that  standard  exists  in  Iowa  Code  Chapter  728,  which  criminalizes  the \ndissemination  and  exhibition  of  โobscene  materialโ  to  minors.  See  Iowa  Code  ยง  728.1(5) \n(defining  โobscene  materialโ  based  on  the  adult  definition  of  obscenity,  as  adjusted  for \nโcommunity standards with respect to what is suitable material for minorsโ). The Legislature \n \n6 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexual%20intercourse (last accessed December 28, 2023).  \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 37 of 46\nchose not to adopt such a standard for school libraries, however, instead enacting a sweeping law \nleading to the removal of hundreds of works, including history books, Pulitzer Prize winning \nnovels, self-help guides for how to avoid being victimized by sexual assault, and historical \nclassics like Ulysses. See Fayetteville Pub. Lib., 2023 WL 4845636, at *11 (โUlysses is widely \nviewed as one of the most influential modernist novels in the English language. The idea of \nbanning it would seem absurd to most modern Americans.โ). If anything, based on the Courtโs \ninterpretation of the plain language of Senate File 496, Iowa school districts are not going far \nenough in removing books.  \nThe State Defendants all but admit the overbreadth problem in how they defend the law. \nAt oral argument, counselโs very first words were that โ[b]ooks with graphic illustrations of \npeople performing oral sex on each other are circulating in Iowa schools, and before Senate File \n496, schools were refusing to remove them.โ (Tr. 67.) Similarly, the declarations submitted in \nsupport of the State Defendantsโ position place considerable emphasis on one specific book with \na graphic depiction of oral sex: Gender Queer: A Memoir. (Penguin House Docket ECF 45-1, pp. \n20, 50, 71, 90.) But Senate File 496 did not merely remove one book from school libraries; it \nremoved hundreds. Thus, the fact that one bookโor even a small handfulโarguably could have \nbeen  removed  without  violating  the  First  Amendment  does  not  sustain  the  law  against  an \noverbreadth challenge.  \nAlthough the context is different, Senate File 496 is similar in many ways to the statute \nprohibiting depictions of โanimal crueltyโ that the Supreme Court struck down in United States \nv. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460. โAnimal crueltyโ was defined as any depiction โin which a living \nanimal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.โ Id. at 464. On its face, \nthe law had โalarming breadth,โ which the Government attempted to mitigate by arguing that it \napplied only to โextremeโ material. Id. at 473โ74. The Supreme Court rejected the Governmentโs \nargument  as  being  inconsistent  with  the  plain  language  of  the  statute.  Id.  at  480.  โThe \nGovernmentโs assurance that it will apply [the statute] far more restrictively than its language \nprovides  is  pertinent  only  as  an  implicit  acknowledgement  of  the  potential  constitutional \nproblems with a more natural reading.โ Id. \nThe same problem is present here. Although the State Defendants attempt to justify \nSenate File 496 by reference to a few books with extensive descriptions or visual depictions of \nsexual conduct, the statute sweeps far more broadly and includes books that have as little as a \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 38 of 46\nsingle sentence describing a sex act. To that end, in contrast to the relatively small number of \nbooks identified by the State Defendants that they believe are highly vulgar, the Penguin House \nPlaintiffs have identified dozensโif not hundredsโof books that have been removed from one \nor more school districts despite undeniable political, artistic, literary, and/or scientific value. This \nincludes  books  and  materials  that:  (a)  are  commonly  covered  on  high  school  Advanced \nPlacement exams, such as The Color Purple, Native Son, The Handmaidโs Tale, As I Lay Dying, \nBeloved, 1984, and Brave New World; (b) address bullying, racism, sexual assault, and other \nforms of trauma, such as Nineteen Minutes, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, The Bluest Eye, \nSong of Solomon, Speak, Shout, Push, Looking for Alaska, The Fault in Our Stars, and Last \nNight at the Telegraph Club; (c) are designed to help students understand the human body and \nhuman anatomy, such as The Way We Work: Getting to Know the Amazing Human Body; (d) are \ndesigned to help people avoid being victimized by sexual assault, such as Sexual Predators and \nThe Truth About Rape; (e) depict important historical events, such as Night and The Rape of \nNanking; and (f) are widely recognized as classic works of literature or cinema, such as Ulysses, \nThe Picture of Dorian Gray, Animal Farm, Forrest Gump, and Memoirs of a Geisha. The \nimbalance between the number of books identified by the State Defendants as justifying the \nrestriction and the number of books identified by the Penguin House Plaintiffs as having been \nswept up in it show that a โsubstantial numberโ of the applications of Senate File 496 are \nunconstitutional when โjudged in relation to the statuteโs plainly legitimate sweep.โ Stevens, 559 \nU.S. at 473. The Publisher/Author Plaintiffs and Student Plaintiffs are therefore likely to prevail \non this aspect of their constitutional challenge.  \nD.  The Educator Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prevail on Their Void for Vagueness Challenge \nto the Book Restrictions in Senate File 496. \nA law or regulation is void for vagueness if it โfails, (1) to define the offense with \nsufficient  definiteness  that  ordinary  people  can  understand  prohibited  conduct;  and  (2)  to \nestablish standards to permit police to enforce the law in a non-arbitrary, non-discriminatory \nmanner.โ  Woodis  v.  Westark  Cmty.  Coll.,  160  F.3d  435,  438  (8th  Cir.  1998).  โ[S]chool \ndisciplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code which imposes criminal sanctions.โ \nFraser, 478 U.S. at 686. โBut when a school policy reaches speech protected by the First \nAmendment, the vagueness doctrine โdemands a greater degree of specificity than in other \ncontexts.โโ Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 668 (quoting Stephenson, 110 F.3d at 1308โ\n09).  \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 39 of 46\nThe Penguin House Plaintiffsโ void for vagueness argument revolves principally around \nthe question of what constitutes a โdescription[] . . . of a sex actโ  for purposes of Iowa Code ยง \n256.11(19). They present evidence that school districts in Iowa are all over the map on the issue, \nwith some districts like the Nevada Community School District having removed hundreds more \nbooks than others like the United Community School District. (Penguin House Docket ECF 34, \np. 34.) Similarly, certain books like 1984, The Fault in Our Stars, and The Handmaidโs Tale \nhave been removed from some school library programs but not others. (Id.) One of the major \nareas of uncertainty is the level of detail a book passage must have before it constitutes a \ndescription or visual depiction of a sex act; for example, is a passage stating that two characters \nโmade passionate loveโ or โhad sexual intercourseโ enough to require removal? (Id., p. 27.) The \nState Defendants say โnoโ and insist the law only requires the removal of books that literally talk \nabout the โpenetration of the penis into the vagina or anus,โ โcontact between the finger, hand, or \nother body part of one person and the genitalia or anus of another person,โ or some other โsex \nactโ as defined in Iowa Code ยง 702.17. To that end, the Proposed Rules issued by the Iowa State \nBoard of Education on November 15, 2023, state that a โreference or mention of a sex act in a \nway that does not describe or visually depict a sex act as defined in that section is not includedโ \nin the definition of โage-appropriate.โ (Penguin House Docket ECF 1-2, p. 4.)  \nThe Court concludes that the Educator Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their argument \nthat the definition of โage-appropriateโ is void for vagueness. See Parents Defendant Educ., 83 \nF.4th at 668 (holding that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in void for vagueness argument based \non ambiguity of the word โrespectโ). According to Merriam-Webster, the word โdescriptionโ \nmeans  โan  act  of  describing,โ  โdiscourse  intended  to  give  a  mental  image  of  something \nexperienced,โ or โa statement or account giving the characteristics of someone or something: a \ndescriptive statement or account.โ Description, MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY.7 In \nthe context of Senate File 496, this definition is elastic enough to leave considerable uncertainty \nabout what crosses the line. In the Courtโs view, for example, a statement that two characters \nโmade passionate love,โ โhad sex on the bed,โ or even just โhad sexโ is a โdescriptionโ of a โsex \nact,โ albeit not a terribly detailed one. Accordingly, reasonable school districts could decide to \nremove books with such language. Reasonable school districts also could decide not to do so, \n \n7 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/description (last visited December 28, 2023).  \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 40 of 46\nhowever, concluding that such language does not contain sufficient visual imagery to constitute a \nโdescription.โ  \nTo take a real example from a real book, similar uncertainty applies to the passage from \nMalinda Loโs book Last Night at the Telegraph Club about a character who โtook Kathโs hand \nand moved it to the cleft of her body . . . Kath put her hand between Lilyโs legs.โ (Penguin House \nDocket ECF 34, p. 32, n. 21.)  The Court interprets this as a โdescriptionโ of โcontact between \nthe . . . hand . . . of one person and the genitalia . . . of another person.โ Other reasonable \nobservers, however, might not agree since the contact is merely strongly implied rather than \nunequivocally stated. This places school districts and licensed professionals like the Educator \nPlaintiffs in the untenable position of having to decide whether to remove Last Night at the \nTelegraph Club from the school libraryโthereby interfering with the First Amendment rights of \nstudentsโor  leaving  it  on  the  shelves  and  facing  potential  discipline,  up  to  and  including \ntermination. By forcing them into this predicament, Senate File 496 likely violates the due \nprocess clause. See Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669 (enjoining vague school district \npolicy requiring students to โrespectโ the gender identity of other students); Stephenson, 110 \nF.3d at 1310 (striking down regulation prohibiting gang symbols due to ambiguity in the word \nโgangโ and potential for arbitrary enforcement); Video Software Dealers Assโn v. Webster, 968 \nF.2d 684, 690 (8th Cir. 1992) (striking down statute as void for vagueness based on failure to \ndefine โviolenceโ).  \nThe Proposed Rulesโwhich state that a โreference or mention of a sex act in a way that \ndoes not describe or visually depict a sex actโ is not forbiddenโdoes not solve the vagueness \nproblem. For starters, the Proposed Rules will not yet be final at the time the penalty provisions \nin Senate File 496 take effect on January 1, 2024. Indeed, they may never become final at all. \nAccordingly, the Proposed Rules do nothing at present to protect the Educator Plaintiffs and \nother licensed professionals from the consequences of making a misjudgment about the scope of \nSenate File 496. Even if the Proposed Rules become final, they do little to clarify the definition \nof โsex act.โ Is a statement that two characters โhad sex on the bedโ or โmade passionate loveโ a \nmere โreference or mention of a sex act,โ or does it โdescribeโ the sex act by stating where (โthe \nbedโ) or how (โpassionatelyโ) it occurred? Perhaps the answer depends on whether the book \nalready described what the characters look like, or what clothes they were wearing, or the \ndimensions of the room they were in. Perhaps not. All the Court can say for now is that it likely \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 41 of 46\nviolates the due process rights of the Educator Plaintiffs to have to make this judgment call at \nrisk of their employment and licensure. See Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669 (enjoining \npolicy due to โlack of clarity [that] makes the policy susceptible to arbitrary enforcementโ).   \nVI.  LEGAL ANALYSIS: THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SENATE FILE 496 AS IT \nRELATES TO RESTRICTIONS IN GRADE SIX AND BELOW ON PROGRAMS, \nPROMOTION, AND INSTRUCTION RELATING TO GENDER IDENTITY AND \nSEXUAL ORIENTATION.  \nUnlike  the  book  restrictions,  the  Court  need  not  dig  deeply  into  First  Amendment \nprinciples and precedent in connection with the restrictions in Senate File 496 on programs, \npromotion, and instruction relating to gender identity and sexual orientation. Instead, the Court \nwill simply evaluate those restrictions under void for vagueness principles. For reasons set forth \nbelow, the Court concludes the Educator Plaintiffs and the one GLBT Youth Student Plaintiff \nwith standing (A.C.) are likely to prevail on their argument that the restrictions are void for \nvagueness under the due process clause.  \nA.  The Breadth of the Restrictions on Programs, Promotion, and Instruction Relating to \nGender Identity and Sexual Orientation Make It All but Certain that the State Will \nEnforce Those Restrictions in an Arbitrary Manner. \nAs explained in detail above, the Court for the most part does not find the language of \nIowa Code ยง 279.80, as enacted by Senate File 496, to be ambiguous. It does, however, find the \nlanguage to be staggeringly broad. On its face, the law prohibits school districts and teachers \nfrom providing any โprogram, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction \nrelating to gender identity or sexual orientation to any students in kindergarten through grade \nsix.โ Based on the neutral definitions of โgender identityโ and โsexual orientation,โ Senate File \n496  unambiguously  prohibits  instruction  relating  to  any  gender  identity  (cisgender  or \ntransgender) and any sexual orientation (gay or straight). See Iowa Code ยง 216.2(10) (defining \nโgender identityโ as โa gender-related identity of a person, regardless of the personโs assigned \nsex at birthโ); Iowa Code ยง 216.2(16) (โdefining โsexual orientationโ as โactual or perceived \nheterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexualityโ). It follows that any teacher in grade six or below \nwho incorporates gender identity or sexual orientation into the curriculum in any way has \nviolated  section  279.80.  This  would  include,  for  example,  teachers  or  other  licensed \nprofessionals like the Educator Plaintiffs who make books available to students that refer to any \ncharacterโs gender or sexual orientation; which is to say, virtually every book ever written. \nSimilarly, a math teacher will have violated the law by requiring students to take an exam stating \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 42 of 46\nthat Sally bought eight apples and ate three and asking how many โsheโ has left. This is a \nforbidden โtest . . . relating to gender identity.โ Any number of other examples also could be \ngiven. \nThe Court must interpret the law this broadly not just because of the neutral definitions of \nโgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโโalthough that is, of course, an important part of the \nanalysisโbut also because the Legislature chose to forbid programs/promotion/instruction/etc. \nโrelating toโ those neutrally-defined topics. The Supreme Court has consistently emphasized that \nthe words โrelating toโ in legislative enactments must be interpreted โexpansively.โ Lamar, \nArcher & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 138 S. Ct. 1752, 1760 (2018); see also, e.g., Pugin v. Garland, \n599 U.S. 600, 607 (2023) (describing โrelating toโ as a โbroad phraseโ). โThe ordinary meaning \nof these words is a broad oneโโto stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; \nrefer; to bring into association with or connection withโ . . .โ Morales v. Trans World Airlines, \nInc., 504 U.S. 374, 383 (1992) (quoting Blackโs Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)). The State \nDefendants confirm the same, taking the position that a school district cannot, for example, have \nstudents in grade six or below read a book with a gay or transgender character as part of the \ncompulsory curriculum, as such a book would โrelate toโ sexual orientation or gender identity. \n(Penguin House Docket ECF 45, p. 19; see also Tr. 84 (โ[A book with a gay character] can be in \nthe library; the teacher cannot use that as curriculum.โ)). Once the State Defendantsโ admission \non the breadth of โrelating toโ is combined with the broad but neutral definitions of โgender \nidentityโ  and  โsexual  orientation,โ  the  conclusion  becomes  unavoidable  that  any  program, \npromotion,  or  instruction  that  incorporates  or  acknowledges  the  gender  identity  or  sexual \norientation of any person in any way โrelates toโ those topics and is impermissible.  \nThe Court is aware that the GLBT Youth Plaintiffs and State Defendants alike believe \nthis is an โabsurdโ interpretation of Senate File 496. (The Penguin House Plaintiffs, by contrast, \ncorrectly recognize that it is the only way to interpret the plain language of the law.) Neither the \nGLBT Youth Plaintiffs or State Defendants, however, offer any alternative interpretation of the \nlaw that actually takes into account the statutory language. The GLBT Youth Plaintiffs instead \nrely on isolated statements by legislators to argue that the law targets gay and transgender \nstudents, while the State Defendants make no meaningful attempt to wrestle with the neutral \ndefinitions of โgender identityโ and โsexual orientationโ at all. \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 43 of 46\nThe Court is not at liberty to interpret Senate File 496 according to stray comments by \nindividual legislators. Nor may the Court apply its own subjective judgment, divorced from the \nstatutory  text,  about  what  the  Legislature  was  probably  trying  to  accomplish.  Instead,  the \nanalysis must focus squarely on the statutory language. See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 \nU.S. 155, 160 (2021) (โWhen [the  text of a statute] enables us to resolve the interpretive \nquestion, our sole function is to apply the law as we find it, not defer to some conflicting reading \nthe government might advance.โ (internal punctuation and citation omitted)). And for good \nreason:  it  would  violate  principles  of  separation  of  powers  for  the  Court  to  pretend  the \nLegislature wrote a different statute than it did. See, e.g., Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016) \n(โCongress sets the rulesโand courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants \nthem to.โ); Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 228 (2008) (โ[W]e are not at liberty to \nrewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable.โ).  \nThe incredible breadth of the actual text of section 279.80, as enacted by Senate File 496, \nmakes it likely that the Educator Plaintiffs and A.C. will prevail on their void for vagueness \nchallenge. As to the Educator Plaintiffs, although the State Defendants promiseโfor nowโthat \nsection 279.80 does not apply to school library programs, this promise is inconsistent with the \nstatutory language, which specifically uses the word โprogramโ to describe what is forbidden. \nSee Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 669 (rejecting the school districtโs attempt for litigation \npurposes to narrow the scope of a policy beyond the plain meaning). Moreover, because the \nstatutory language prohibits even instruction relating to heterosexual and cisgender characters, a \nsixth-grade teacher like Gutmann is theoretically subject to discipline no matter what he does. \nFinally, as discussed in an earlier section, the word โpromotionโ is broad enough that the State \ncould decide, consistent with the statutory language, to bring disciplinary measures against \nGutmann and other teachers (like Browder) or licensed professionals (like Abry) who make \nbooks with gay or transgender characters available to sixth graders, particularly if the teacher \ndoes so after learning that a student has questions or concerns about gender identity or sexual \norientation.  This  combination  of  circumstances  โmakes  the  policy  susceptible  to  arbitrary \nenforcementโ on an โad hoc and subjective basis.โ Id. It follows that the Educator Plaintiffs are \nlikely to prevail on their void for vagueness challenge. See id.; see also Stephenson, 110 F.3d at \n1310.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 44 of 46\nThe same is true for A.C. The breadth of the law means that a reasonable school district \nwould not permit her to join a GSA, thus interfering with her First  Amendment rights to \nexpressive association. See Gay & Lesbian Students Assโn, 850 F.2d at 368. A.C. also could say \nany number of things in the classroom about gender identity or sexual orientation that the State \nor a school district might decide is impermissible, thus giving the State or school district virtually \nโunfettered discretionโ to decide she was disrupting the class by raising inappropriate topics. \nStephenson, 110 F.3d at 1310. Granted, one would hope the State or school district would never \ndo such a thing, but a void for vagueness challenge ultimately rises or falls on the โplain \nmeaningโ of the statute, not the State Defendantsโ position that it means something other than \nwhat it says. Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at 668โ69. A.C. is therefore likely to prevail on \nher void for vagueness challenge.  \nB.  The State Defendantsโ Promise to Only Enforce the Law in a Discriminatory Fashion \nDoes Not Solve the Constitutional Problem. \nAlthough the State Defendants never address head-on the neutral definitions of โgender \nidentityโ and โsexual orientationโ in Senate File 496, their briefing and argument leave the \nunmistakable  impression  that  they  believe  the  law  only  forbids  programs,  promotion,  and \ninstruction relating to transgender people and non-heteronormative relationships. In other words, \nin the State Defendantsโ view, the law permits a sixth-grade teacher to assign a book in which a \nman and woman married to each other but prohibits the same teacher from assigning a book in \nwhich two men are married to each other. Similarly, according to the State Defendants, it is fine \nif an assigned bookโs characters are โboysโ and โgirlsโ so long as this description matches their \nbiological sex, but not if one of those characters is transgender.  \nBecause this position is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, it is not \nterribly relevant to the Courtโs analysis except in one sense: it confirms that the most likely \nenforcement of Senate File 496 will be against teachers and students who want to discuss same-\nsex  relationships  or  transgenderism.  This  adds  a  new  layer  to  the  constitutional  problems \ndescribed above because it inhibits the ability of students to โexpress beliefs that others might \nfind disagreeable or offensive.โ See id. at 667. Under Parents Defending Educ., it likely would \nviolate the First Amendment to allow students to discuss heterosexual relationships or cisgender \npeople as much as they wish but cut off any discussion of same sex relationships or transgender \npeople. See id. The State Defendantsโ putative interpretation of the statute therefore reinforces \nthe constitutional problems, rather than resolving them.   \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 45 of 46\nVII.  APPLICATION OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS.  \nโWhen a plaintiff has shown a likely violation of his or her First Amendment rights, the \nother requirements for obtaining a preliminary injunction are generally deemed to have been \nsatisfied.โ Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 692 F.3d 864, 870 (8th Cir. \n2012). Thus, injunctive relief is appropriate simply because: (i) all Penguin House Plaintiffs and \nGLBT  Youth  Plaintiffs  are  likely  to  prevail  on  the  merits  of  their  challenge  to  the  book \nrestrictions in Senate File 496; and (ii) the Educator Plaintiffs and the one GLBT Youth Plaintiff \nwith standing are likely to prevail on the merits of their challenge to the restrictions in Senate \nFile  496  on  programs,  promotion,  and  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  and  sexual \norientation. See id.; see also Carson, 978 F.3d at 1059 (โWhile no single factor is determinative, \nthe probability of success factor is the most significant.โ (internal punctuation and citation \nomitted)).8 Nonetheless, the Court will briefly analyze the other factors as well.  \nThe  irreparable  harm  factor  weighs  squarely  in  favor  of  imposing  a  preliminary \ninjunction.  โIt  is  well-established  that  โ[t]he  loss  of  First  Amendment  freedoms,  for  even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.โโ Powell v. Noble, 798 \nF.3d 690, 702 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373)). Here, the Student \nPlaintiffs and Publisher/Author Plaintiffs face such a loss. Moreover, the Educator Plaintiffs are \nat risk of termination, loss of licensure, or other consequences if they are deemed to have \nviolated either aspect of Senate File 496. By contrast, while the temporary invalidation of \nportions of a duly enacted state law is a serious and significant remedy, school districts retain the \ndiscretion they have always had to control curriculum, make decisions about school libraries, and \notherwise set expectations for students and teachers. The balancing of equities therefore weighs \nin favor of injunctive relief, as does the public interest. See Parents Defending Educ., 83 F.4th at \n669 (awarding preliminary injunctive relief).  \nVIII.  CONCLUSION. \n  The Court GRANTS the Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed by the Penguin House \nPlaintiffs and GRANTS IN PART the Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed by the GLBT \nYouth Plaintiffs. All Defendants are hereby ENJOINED from enforcing or acting in furtherance \nof the provisions of Senate File 496 that: (i) require the removal of books from school libraries \n \n8 Because the analysis of the First Amendment and due process issues is sufficient to satisfy the Court that a \npreliminary injunction should be entered, the Court will not analyzeโand expresses no view onโthe merits of the \nGLBT Youth Plaintiffsโ arguments under the Equal Access Act and equal protection clause.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00474-SHL-SBJ   Document 65   Filed 12/29/23   Page 46 of 46\nthat  are  not  โage-appropriateโ;  and  (ii)  prohibit  any  โprogram,  curriculum,  test,  survey, \nquestionnaire,  promotion,  or  instruction  relating  to  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation  to \nstudents in kindergarten through grade six.โ No bond or other security will be required.  \n  The Court DENIES IN PART the Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed by the GLBT \nYouth Plaintiffs as it relates to the provision of Senate File 496 that requires school districts to \nnotify parents if a student requests an accommodation relating to gender identity. This provision \nof the law remains in effect and fully enforceable.  \n \n  IT IS SO ORDERED.   \n \n  Dated: December 29, 2023                 ______________________________________     \n \n                   STEPHEN H.
