In its reply brief, the plaintiff objected to consideration of certain evidence filed by the defendant, contending that evidence had not been produced in discovery and asking that the evidence be stricken. Doc. 47 at 7 n.4. This is allowed by the Local Rules. LR 7.6. The defendant did not file a surreply as allowed by LR 7.6, but because the objection was in a footnote, the Court will give the defendant a short opportunity to respond, if it wishes. If the defendant disputes the facts or law referenced in the reply brief footnote 4, Doc. 47 at 7 n.4, it may file no later than September 5, 2025, a sur-reply brief limited to 1) 1000 words and 2) why the Court should consider the objected-to evidence(rw)"

          "description": "TEXT ORDER granting 2 Motion to Proceed under Fictitious Name; Plaintiffs, John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3 (\"Plaintiffs\"), are minors being held in pretrial detention. (See Docket Entry 2.) Plaintiffs, by and through their parents and natural guardians (\"Movants\"), move the court to allow both Plaintiffs and Movants to proceed under pseudonyms. (See id.) Defendants, Eddie M. Buffaloe, Jr., William L. Lassiter, and Peter Brown (\"Defendants\"), who are sued in their official capacities as representatives of the Government, did not respond to the motion. Generally, \"[t]he title of the complaint must name all the parties....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). \"[W]hen a party seeks to litigate under a pseudonym, a district court has an independent obligation to ensure that extraordinary circumstances support such a request by balancing the party's stated interest in anonymity against the public's interest in openness and any prejudice that anonymity would pose to the opposing party.\" Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 274 (4th Cir. 2014). When making this determination, the court considers: (1) \"whether the justification asserted by the requesting party...is to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; (2) whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm...; (3) the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; (4) whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and, (5) relatedly, the risk of unfairness to the opposing party from allowing an action against it to proceed anonymously.\" Doe v. Doe, 85 F.4th 206, 211 (4th Cir. 2023) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \"Despite the presumption in favor of disclosure, the Rules describe circumstances in which filings may be redacted and where access to public filings may be limited. Minors, for example, must be referred to using only their initials.\" G.D. v. Kannapolis City Sch. Bd. of Educ., No. 1:22CV1001, 2023 WL 2538927, at *4 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 16, 2023); Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a)(3); see also Yacovelli v. Moeser, No. 1:02CV596, 2004 WL 1144183, at *6 (M.D.N.C. May 20, 2004). Here, the factors weigh in favor of granting Plaintiffs' request. First, Plaintiffs challenge the use of solitary confinement among juveniles in detention centers, which makes it possible that Plaintiffs will need to submit sensitive documents that they wish to keep private, including medical records and court records. (See Docket Entry 1 at 2.) Second, since Plaintiffs are entirely within Defendants' custody, Plaintiffs could possibly be targeted with retaliatory action. Third, Plaintiffs are minors, which weighs heavily in favor of granting the motion. Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 186 (5th Cir. 1981) (noting \"the youth of these plaintiffs as a significant factor in the matrix of considerations arguing for anonymity\"). Finally, Plaintiffs bring suit against the Government, and thus there is little risk of unfairness to the opposing party. See Doe v. N. Carolina Cent. Univ., No. 1:98CV01095, 1999 WL 1939248, at *4 (M.D.N.C. Apr. 15, 1999) (stating that actions to proceed pseudonymously against the Government are more likely to be granted because \"such suits involve no injury to the Government's reputation\" (internal quotation omitted)). In fact, Defendants do not oppose Plaintiffs' motion. As such, the Court grants Plaintiffs' and Movants' request to proceed pseudonymously. See G.D., No. 1:22CV1001, 2023 WL 2538927, at *4 (\"recognizing that a minor child and his parents' privacy interests are intractably intertwined\" (quotation omitted)). Plaintiffs shall be identified as John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3. Further, minors Plaintiffs' parents and natural guardians shall be identified as Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3.

          "description": "TEXT ORDER Granting in part 50 Third Party Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Third Party Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC) to Produce Documents and File Motion to Quash. DRNC seeks additional time up to January 31, 2025 to file its response to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel DRNC to Produce Documents and file a Motion to Quash Plaintiffs' Subpoena. Plaintiffs oppose an extension beyond January 16, 2025. (See Docket Entry 53.) At the outset, the Court notes that Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel (Docket Entry 48) related to the subpoena Plaintiffs served on DRNC pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 on December 10, 2024, appears to be filed in the wrong district. See Docket Entry 48-3 (Raleigh, NC as the place where production is demanded); Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B)(i) (\"At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an order compelling production or inspection.\"); 28 U.S.C. ยง 113(a) (United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina-the court which encompasses Wake County, in which Raleigh, NC is located); see also Sacks Holdings, Inc. v. Grin Nat. USA Ltd., No. 1:23CV1058, 2024 WL 3535390, at *1 (M.D.N.C. July 25, 2024). Given such, the Court will grant DRNC's extension motion (Docket Entry 50) in part to the extent that it shall have up to and including January 21, 2025 to file any opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel and/or to move to quash Plaintiffs' Subpoena, except that the parties should ensure that the subpoena-related litigation is filed in the proper Court. The Court encourages the parties to renew efforts at resolution of this discovery dispute without Court intervention in any Court. Issued by MAG/JUDGE JOE L. WEBSTER on 1/3/2025.(pl)"

The plaintiffs sued North Carolina's Department of Public Safety (&ldquo;NCDPS&rdquo;) under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Represented by private counsel and the Council for Children&rsquo;s Rights, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney&rsquo;s fees. They challenged NCDPS's practice of solitary confinement for juveniles in state detention centers. The defendants in the suit were NCDPS and several of its officers, as well as the Facility Director of Cabarrus Juvenile Jail. NCDPS is responsible for the administration of statewide juvenile detention facilities. The complaint alleged that NCDPS had embraced a policy of solitary confinement for juveniles at detention centers across North Carolina. The plaintiffs alleged that juveniles were kept in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with limited human interaction. The case was assigned to Judge Loretta Copeland Biggs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought to represent a class under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class on September 26, 2024. The proposed class was &ldquo;all juveniles who are currently, or in the future will be, detained in a North Carolina juvenile detention facility operated by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (&ldquo;NCDPS&rdquo;).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As of February 17, 2025, this case was ongoing.</p>",

Buffaloe, Jr., William L. Lassiter, and \nPeter Brown (collectively, the โDefendantsโ), and allege as follows:   \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Over a decade ago, the Attorney Generalโs National Task Force on Children \nExposed to Violence addressed the harmful effects of solitary confinement of children, \nstating:  \nNowhere  is  the  damaging  impact  of  incarceration  on \nvulnerable  children  more  obvious  than  when  it  involves \nsolitary  confinement.    A  2002  investigation  by  the  U.S. \nDepartment  of  Justice  showed  that  juveniles  experience \nsymptoms of paranoia, anxiety, and depression even after very \nshort periods of isolation.  Confined youth who spend extended \nperiods  isolated  are  among  the  most  likely  to  attempt  or \nactually commit suicide.  One national study found that among \nthe suicides in juvenile facilities, half of the victims were in \nisolation at the time they took their own lives, and 62 percent \nof victims had a history of solitary confinement.1  \n \n2.  This practice was so prevalent and damaging that after an investigation by \nthe  United  States  Justice  Department,  President  Obama  banned  the  use  of  solitary \nconfinement on juveniles in federal prisons in 2016.  President Obama stated that \n[r]esearch suggests that solitary confinement has the potential \nto lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It \nhas  been  linked  to  depression,  alienation,  withdrawal,  a \nreduced ability to interact with others and the potential for \nviolent behavior.  Some studies  indicate  that  it can  worsen \nexisting mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners \n \n1 Robert L. Listenbee, Jr. et al., Report of the Attorney Generalโs National Task Force on \nChildren  Exposed  to  Violence  at  178  (Dec.  12,  2012), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/defendingchildhood/cev-rpt-full.pdf. \nPage 2 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 2 of 57\n\n \nin  solitary  are  more  likely  to  commit  suicide,  especially \njuveniles and people with mental illnesses. \n \nThe  United  States  is  a  nation  of  second  chances,  but  the \nexperience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that \nsecond chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble \nholding  down  jobs,  reuniting  with  family  and  becoming \nproductive members of society.2 \n \n3.  Recognizing the harmful effects solitary confinement have on juveniles, over \nseven years ago, in June 2016, Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety \n(โNCDPSโ) announced the end to solitary confinement for inmates in adult correctional \nfacilities who were under 18 years of age.  \n4.   In that announcement, Defendant Lassiter stated: โWe also used to lock kids \nin their room for a long time, and put them in isolation.  We donโt do that anymore.  We \nfind that kids that are locked in their rooms, theyโre not growing.  Theyโre not getting the \ntherapy.  Theyโre not trying to use the skills weโre trying to teach them.โ3 \n5.  Despite  the  overwhelming  consensus  that  solitary  confinement  has \ndevastating and long-term effects on juveniles, including depression, anxiety, suicide, \npsychosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and despite the abandonment of solitary \nconfinement for juveniles throughout the country, NCDPS has embraced a policy, custom, \nand practice of solitary confinement of children as young as ten years old, who have not \n \n2 Barack Obama, Why We Must Rethink Solitary Confinement, Wash. Post (Jan. 25, 2016), \nattached as Exhibit 1. \n3 Zak Dahlheimer, The Dark Past of the Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center, \nCBS17 (Nov. 24, 2019), www.cbs17.com/news/the-dark-past-of-the-stonewall-jackson-\nyouth-development-center/. \nPage 3 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 3 of 57\n\n \nhad their cases adjudicated yet, at juvenile detention centers across the state of North \nCarolina,  including  the  Cabarrus  Regional  Juvenile  Detention  Center  (the  โCabarrus \nJuvenile Jailโ), for nearly 24 hours a day. \n6.  As a result of the persistent use of solitary confinement for children, NCDPS \nis  also  denying  children  in  their  custody  educational  services,  further  harming  their \ndevelopment. \n7.  At one such juvenile detention centerโthe Cabarrus Juvenile Jailโchildren \nare regularly confined into small cells for 23 hours a day or more for weeks or even months \nwithout any valid reason. These children, many of whom already have mental health \nchallenges, have little to nothing to do in their cells to advance their development and \ngrowth: no meaningful human interaction, no education or programming to address their \ndevelopmental, physical, and clinical needs, and limited reading materials. The children \nare given 10 minutes a day to shower and, on some days, may be allowed out of their cell \nfor 30 minutes of โrecreation time,โ or a 10-minute phone call, or to fill their water bottle, \nor a half hour or hour of โschoolโ, or to clean up the jail.  \n8.  At  another  juvenile  detention  Centerโthe  Dillon  Regional  Juvenile \nDetention Center (the โDillon Juvenile Jailโ)โchildren are let out of their cells for 20 \nminutes per day to shower and make a phone call.  They are locked in their cell for the \nother 23 hours and 40 minutes of the day.  The childrenโs only education is crossword \npuzzles and word searches slipped under their cell door a few times a week.  \nPage 4 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 4 of 57\n\n \n9.  Defendantsโ policy, custom, and practice of solitary confinement has been \ngoing on so long many of the children detained do not even realize there is anything other \nthan solitary confinementโthat is, they think that being locked in their cell for over 23 \nhours a day is normal practice when being detained prior to adjudication of their case.  \n10.  The children are so desperate to leave their cells for any amount of time that \nsome have resorted to offering to mop floors or clean the jail just to get out of their cells. \n11.  Predictably, keeping the children locked in their cells for nearly 24 hours a \nday has also resulted in the children acting out because of their frustration and anger at the \nsituation.   \n12.  Instead  of  addressing  the  root  cause  of  the  problem,  Defendants  have \nresponded by imposing further restrictions on the children when they act out, placing them \nin what they call โTemporary Confinementโ or โTCโ where Defendants take away the few \nremaining humane aspects of their confinement for days at a time, such as putting the flap \ndown on the small window on their door so they cannot see out of their cell or turning off \nthe water in their cell so they cannot flush the toilet or use the sink. \n13.  Solitary  confinement  has  been  proven  dangerous  for  all  ages,  but  is \nespecially harmful for juveniles due to their developmental vulnerabilities.  It is well \nestablished that isolating children and thereby preventing children from having meaningful \ncontact with others increases their risk of suicide and self-harm.  For those children that \nhave a mental health challenge or disability, the risk of harm can be even greater.  Despite \nthe known dangers to the children in their care and their admission of the harm that solitary \nPage 5 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 5 of 57\n\n \nconfinement causes children, Defendants run the juvenile jails in North Carolina with \ninadequate staffing that predictably results in children being locked in their cells nearly 24 \nhours a day.  Defendants have chosen this route in the face of public scrutiny and despite \nopen discussions of the current conditions. \n14.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, bring this \naction  to  redress  the  violations  of  their  civil,  statutory,  and  constitutional  rights  by \nDefendants while acting under color of state law.  Plaintiffs challenge Defendantsโ policies \nand practices of using solitary confinement at juvenile detention facilities across the state \nof North Carolina, including the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail and the Dillon Juvenile Jail.  These \nchildren have suffered immense physical, social, and psychological harm from solitary \nconfinement, and as such, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief demanding that \nDefendants cease the challenged unconstitutional policies and practices. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for Defendantsโ \nviolation of their civil rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution. \n16.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331, which provides federal district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions \narising under the U.S. Constitution and the laws of the United States, and 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1343(a)(3), which provides federal district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions to \nPage 6 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 6 of 57\n\n \nredress the deprivation under color of any State law, of any right secured by the U.S. \nConstitution. \n17.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants as residents of North \nCarolina. \n18.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because the Cabarrus Juvenile \nJail is located in the Middle District of North Carolina and a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in the Middle District of North \nCarolina. \n19.  This Court is authorized to grant declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nPARTIES \nThe Named Plaintiffs \n \n20.

Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety is the state agency \nthat acts in its administrative capacity to operate ten juvenile detention centers across \nNorth Carolina, including the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.  NCDPS is responsible for, among \nother things, the administration of educational services and programs for children in its \ncustody in juvenile detention centers awaiting adjudication of their case. \n24.  Defendant  Eddie  M.  Buffaloe,  Jr.  is  Secretary  of  the  North  Carolina \nDepartment of Public Safety, the state agency designed to operate the juvenile detention \nfacilities.  Defendant Buffaloe is named as a defendant in his official capacity.  As \nSecretary  of  NCDPS,  Defendant  Buffaloe  is  in  charge  of  the  administration  and \nsupervision of NCDPS and had at all material times overall supervisory authority of the \nten juvenile detention centers in North Carolina operated by NCDPS, including the \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail, and was and is acting under color of law. \n25.  Defendant William L. Lassiter is the Deputy Secretary of the Division of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (โDJJโ), a division of NCDPS.  Defendant \nLassiter is named as a defendant in his official capacity.  As Deputy Secretary of DJJ, \nDefendant  Lassiter  is  in  charge  of  the  administration  and  supervision  of  juvenile \nPage 8 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 8 of 57\n\n \ncorrections within NCDPS and had at all material times overall supervisory authority of \nthe ten juvenile detention centers operated by NCDPS in North Carolina, including the \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail, and was and is acting under color of state law. \n26.  Defendant Peter Brown is the Facility Director of the Cabarrus Juvenile \nJail.  Defendant Brown is named as a defendant in his official capacity.  Defendant Brown \nis responsible for the operation, staffing, and oversight at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail. \nFACTS \nNorth Carolina Juvenile Detention Centers \n27.  In North Carolina, NCDPS provides care and oversight for juveniles upon \nadjudication as delinquent for commission of offenses that would be criminal if committed \nby adults.   \n28.  NCDPS  also  administers  and  supervises  facilities  that  house  juveniles \nawaiting adjudication for commission of offenses that would be criminal if committed by \nadults (juvenile detention centers) and juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent \n(youth development centers or โYDCโ). \n29.  In North Carolina, Defendant NCDPS administers ten juvenile detention \ncenters:  Alexander Regional Juvenile Detention Center; Cabarrus Juvenile Jail; Chatham \nDetention; Cumberland Regional Juvenile Detention Center; Dillon Juvenile Jail; Lenoir \nDetention; New  Hanover  Regional Juvenile Detention Center; Pitt Regional Juvenile \nDetention  Center;  Richmond Jenkins Juvenile  Detention  Center;  and Wake  Regional \nPage 9 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 9 of 57\n\n \nJuvenile Detention Center.  There are also four county-operated juvenile detention centers \nin North Carolina.4 \n30.  NCDPS is responsible for the care and oversight of children at these juvenile \ndetention centers.   \n31.  Juvenile detention facilities in North Carolina house children between the \nages of 10 and 17.  \n32.  In 2021, 2,423 children were held at juvenile detention centers in North \nCarolina.5 \n33.  The Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, located in Concord, North Carolina, is a 62-bed \njuvenile  detention  facility  that  houses  children  prior  to  adjudication  of  their  cases, \npending  disposition  after  adjudication  of  their  cases,  or  pending  placement  after \ndisposition of their cases.  It is overseen by Defendant Peter Brown, the Facility Director, \nwho is responsible for the operation, staffing, and oversight. \n34.  Cabarrus County also has a YDC located right next to the Cabarrus Juvenile \nJail that houses children upon adjudication as delinquent.  To relieve the overcrowding at \n \n4  Juvenile  Detention  Centers,  NCDPS  (last  visited  Jan.  7,  2024), \nhttps://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/juvenile-justice/juvenile-facility-\noperations/juvenile-detention-centers#Alexander-1398. \n5  Ryan  Shaffer,  NC  Juvenile  Justice  System  Facing  Critical  Shortage  and  Unsafe \nConditions  for  Youth  and  Staff  at  Detention  Centers,  PRE  News  (May  18,  2023), \nhttps://www.publicradioeast.org/pre-news/2023-05-18/nc-juvenile-justice-system-facing-\ncritical-shortage-and-unsafe-conditions-for-youth-and-staff-at-detention-centers. \nPage 10 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 10 of 57\n\n \nthe Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, certain children have been incarcerated pre-adjudication at the \nCabarrus YDC (the โCabarrus Juvenile Prisonโ). \n35.  A significant number of children housed in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail come \nfrom Mecklenburg County.   \n36.  Mecklenburg County did not have a juvenile detention center from 2010 to \n2019.  Mecklenburg County closed the detention center to save money during the recession.  \nBut it reopened when North Carolinaโs Raise the Age law took effect in 2019.  The State \nof North Carolina entered into a 3-year contract with the Charlotte Mecklenburg Sheriffโs \nOffice to operate a juvenile detention facility at Jail North.6  It was the largest in the state, \naccommodating up to 72 children.     \n37.  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden decided to close the juvenile \ndetention center at Jail North by December 1, 2022 to, in part, bulk up staffing at its adult \njail uptown and save money.7  \n38.  The children at Jail North were transferred to various detention facilities \nwithin North Carolina, with the vast majority going to the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.  \n39.  The Dillon Juvenile Jail, located in Butner, North Carolina, is a 35-bed \njuvenile detention facility that houses children prior to adjudication of their cases.    \n \n6  Lisa  Worf,  Mecklenburg  Juvenile  Detention  Centerโs  Closing  Separates  Families, \nBurdens  Other  Facilities,  WFAE  (Dec.  1,  2022),  https://www.wfae.org/charlotte-\narea/2022-12-01/meck-juvenile-detention-centers-closing-separates-families-burdens-\nother-facilities. \n7 Id. \nPage 11 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 11 of 57\n\n \n40.  NCDPS administers a state subsidy program to pay a county that provides \njuvenile detention services and meets State standards a certain per diem per juvenile.  In \ngeneral, this per diem is 50% of the total cost of caring for a juvenile within the county and \n100% of the total cost of caring for a juvenile from another county.  N.C.G.S. ยง 143B-820.   \n41.  Therefore, there is an economic incentive for detention centers to allow \nchildren from other counties to be jailed at their detention center.   \n42.  North Carolina state statute requires that any county placing a juvenile in a \ndetention facility in another county shall pay 50% of the total cost of caring for the juvenile \nto NCDPS.  Id. \n43.  North Carolina allows detention of children 10 years of age or older before \nthey are adjudicated under certain circumstances.  Children detained at juvenile detention \ncenters in North Carolina, including the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail and Dillon Juvenile Jail, \nhave, for the most part, not been adjudicated delinquent or convicted of the offense for \nwhich they were detained, but rather are locked in the facility pending hearing, disposition, \nor placement.   \n44.  Prior to adjudication, North Carolina state statute requires the court to review \nthe need for continued secure custody and so children have frequent court appearances. \n45.  Children transferred to Superior Court in North Carolina for trial as adults \nare housed in juvenile detention pending trial if they are not released on bond.  \n46.   Children in the juvenile justice system are different from adults in the \ncriminal justice system; children who are adjudicated delinquent are not convicted of \nPage 12 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 12 of 57\n\n \ncrimes.  Children are adjudicated delinquent in non-criminal proceedings and are not \nprovided with the same procedural protections as adults.   \n47.  The primary goal of delinquency proceedings is to rehabilitate the child, not \nto punish.   \n48.  Juvenile detention centers are intended to be temporary facilities where a \nchild will stay while waiting to go to court or until a placement can be arranged. \nNCDPS Obligations \n49.  Under North Carolina state statute, โ[i]n order to provide any juvenile in a \njuvenile facility with appropriate treatment according to that juvenileโs need, [NCDPS] \nshall be responsible for the administration of statewide educational, clinical, psychological, \npsychiatric,  social,  medication,  vocational,  and  recreational  services  or  programs.โ  \nN.C.G.S. ยง 143B-815. \n50.  NCDPS touts that โ[j]uvenile detention centers provide quality services and \nprograms for juveniles based on their individual needs, to give youths opportunities for \npositive behavioral change and development.โ8 \n51.  NCDPS also touts that โ[j]uvenile detention centers provide a safe, secure, \ncontrolled and humane environment for juveniles and staff . . . and are staffed to provide \nappropriate oversight.โ9 \n \n8 Juvenile Detention Centers, supra note 4. \n9 Id. \nPage 13 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 13 of 57\n\n \n52.  NCDPS states that โyouths are provided with basic educational services that \nmirror the course of study adopted by the N.C. Department of Public Instruction.โ10 \n53.  Far from the rosy public statements put out by NCDPS, the children locked \nin juvenile detention centers across North Carolina are not receiving โquality services,โ are \nnot in a โhumane environment,โ and are not receiving โbasic educational servicesโ. \nSolitary Confinement at Juvenile Detention Centers in North Carolina \n54.  Children at juvenile detention centers across North Carolina are being locked \nin their cells 23 to 24 hours a day every day.   \n55.  Depending on the detention center, the children may be allowed out of their \ncells to:  take a 10 minute shower; for 30 minutes of rec time twice a week; for 10 minutes \nto make a phone call; sometimes, if they ask, to go fill their water bottle or to clean an area \nof the juvenile detention center; or to go to โschoolโ, which typically lasts a half hour to an \nhour.  Periodically the guards may allow a few children at a time to leave their cells for 30-\n60 minutes.   \n56.  Other than that, children are kept in their locked cell every other minute of \nthe day. \n57.  Upon information and belief, this solitary confinement has been going on \nstatewide for at least approximately one year. \n \n10 Id.   \nPage 14 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 14 of 57\n\n \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail \n58.  The Cabarrus Juvenile Jail is one of ten juvenile detention centers in North \nCarolina.  It has two buildings with 62 total beds.  It consists of approximately 62 cells \narranged on one floor and houses only juveniles.  A typical cell is no larger than 8 by 10 \nfeet and contains a toilet, sink, and small window to the outside.  Each cell holds one child.  \nThe door to each cell is metal with only a panel slot to the outside through which food trays \nare passed and a small narrow window.  The cells have no phones, radios, or televisions.   \n59.  The cells in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail are arranged around a common area \nwith tables, chairs, and a television. \n60.  The population of children detained at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail varies over \ntime, though upon information and belief there are typically approximately 62 children at \nthe Cabarrus Juvenile Jail on any given day. \n61.  Children are often held at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail for weeks at a time.  It \nis common for children to be locked in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail for multiple months.   \n62.  Children at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail are locked in their cells for 23 or more \nhours a day.  They are allowed out of their cells for one hour or less per day.   \n63.  NCDPS decides what the children are let out of their cell to do.  On most \ndays, the children get out of their cell for a 10-minute shower.  Twice a week the children \nare let out of their cells for 30 minutes of rec time.  Sometimes the children are let out of \ntheir cells to make a phone call to their family.  Other times NCDPS employees allow the \nchildren out of their cells to fill their water bottles or clean areas of the Cabarrus Juvenile \nPage 15 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 15 of 57\n\n \nJail.  Sometimes the children are let out of their cell to attend โschool,โ which lasts a half \nhour to an hour.  \n64.  At the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, if the children take longer than 10 minutes in \nthe shower, they have to shower using the sink in their room the next day. \n65.  For some children at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, the solitary confinement is \nmade worse by the fact that there are not always mattresses available for the beds in cells \nfor newly detained children.  As a result, children sometimes are forced to sleep for \nmultiple nights on a piece of plastic that serves as a bed frame in the cells.   \n66.  Because they are not allowed out of their cells for more than a few minutes \na day, those children without mattresses are also faced with a decision during the day of \nwhether to lay on the plastic bed frame, sit on the plastic bed frame, lay or sit on the dirty \njail floor, or be forced to stand in their cell all day. \n67.  Children  locked  in  their  cells  have  virtually  no  meaningful  human \ninteraction.    Sometimes  they  can  talk  to  other  children  through  the  walls,  but  risk \npunishment for doing so. \n68.  Defendants also run the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison, located right next door to \nthe Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, for children who have been adjudicated delinquent.   \n69.  Because of the lack of open cells at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail, at certain \npoints in 2023 children who have not yet had their cases adjudicated and would otherwise \nbe held at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail have been held at the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison.  \nChildren who have been held at the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison and then later held at the \nPage 16 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 16 of 57\n\n \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail have asked the guards to be transferred to the Cabarrus Juvenile \nPrison because there they were let out of their cells on a regular basis. \n70.  Upon information and belief, the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison allows children \nout of their cells on a regular basis in part because various public interest organizations in \nNorth Carolina have oversight authority of the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison and regularly \ninspect the conditions of children detained in the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison. \n71.  Upon information and belief, such inspections do not occur at the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail.   \nDillon Juvenile Jail \n72.  The Dillon Juvenile Jail is one of ten juvenile detention centers in North \nCarolina.  It has 35 beds and only houses juveniles.  A typical cell is approximately 7 by 9 \nfeet and contains a toilet, sink, and small window with bars to the outside of the jail.  The \ndoor to each cell is metal with only a narrow rectangle window to the inside of the jail.  \nBlack tape covers the small window to the inside of the jail so the children cannot see out. \n73.  Children locked up at the Dillon Juvenile Jail report that there are sometimes \nblack maggots in the toilet in their cell.  Instead of addressing the problem, Defendant \nNCDPS tells the children just not to use the toilet for a day or two.  The toilet in each \nchildโs cell is the only toilet the child has access to because the children are locked in their \ncells nearly 24 hours a day. \n74.  The cells in the Dillon Juvenile Jail are arranged around a day room with \ntables, chairs, and a television. \nPage 17 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 17 of 57\n\n \n75.  Children are often held in the Dillon Juvenile Jail for weeks at a time.  It is \ncommon for children to be locked in the Dillon Juvenile Jail for multiple months. \n76.  Children at the Dillon Juvenile Jail are locked in their cells for more than 23 \nhours a day.  On most days, the children are allowed out of their cell to shower for 10 \nminutes.  Some days the children are not allowed to leave their cell to even shower. \n77.  The children at the Dillon Juvenile Jail, up until approximately December \n19, 2023, were allowed to use the phone for 10 minutes each day.  Beginning on December \n19, 2023, Defendant NCDPS put a new policy in place at the Dillon Juvenile Jail limiting \ntelephone use to once a week. \n78.  The children at the Dillon Juvenile Jail are not given any rec time.  The \nchildren do not go outside unless they are transported to a court hearing. \n79.  The children use the faucet in the sink in their cell for drinking water.  They \nare not allowed out of their cell to get water. \n80.  The only time the children can interact with the other children is at night \nwhen they yell hoping that the other children can hear them. \n81.  In at least one case, a child was held at the Dillon Juvenile Jail in these \nconditions for 50 days straight.   \n82.  Some children being held at the Dillon Juvenile Jail, who have not even been \nadjudicated of a crime, say being at the Dillon Juvenile Jail is worse than prison. \nPage 18 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 18 of 57\n\n \n83.  The conditions at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail and Dillon Juvenile Jail are very \ndifferent than the conditions children experienced when held at Jail North before it closed \nat the end of 2022.   \n84.  Children  describe  the  conditions  at  Jail  North  as  much  better  than  the \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail.   \n85.  Upon information and belief, while at Jail North, the children were assigned \none of three levels.  Bronze level meant that the child got 30 minutes outside his cell every \nday and a 5-minute call with his family.  Silver level meant that the child could stay outside \nhis cell all day long and could have a 10-minute call with his family.  Gold level meant that \nthe child could stay outside his cell all day long and could have a 15-minute call with his \nfamily.  \n86.  Upon information and belief, children on silver or gold level could shower \nwhenever they wanted to, eat meals in the pod at small tables with other children, and go \noutside whenever they wanted during the day to engage in activities such as basketball. \n87.

The  policy,  custom,  and  practice  of  near  24-hour  per  day  solitary \nconfinement has developed as a consistent and deliberate policy, custom, and practice over \nan extended period of time under the leadership of Defendants Buffaloe and Lassiter, who \nPage 19 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 19 of 57\n\n \nare responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of the juvenile jails, and under the \noversight of NCDPS, which has policy making authority for the juvenile jails and exercises \nhiring authority and oversight.  Defendants have subjected children to these conditions with \nno legitimate penological government purpose and in the face of condemnation of these \npractices. \n89.  Upon information and belief, the policy, custom, and practice of locking \nchildren in their cells nearly 24 hours a day experienced by children in juvenile jails is a \ndirect result of a policy and practice of understaffing the juvenile detention centers that has \nbeen established by Defendant NCDPS and overseen and implemented by Defendants \nBuffaloe, Lassiter, and Brown. \n90.  The staffing shortages are a regular topic of discussion in the press, yet \nDefendants have denied that solitary confinement is being used on children regularly. \nChildren Are More Vulnerable to the Harms of Solitary Confinement \n91.  Solitary confinement, also known as segregation or isolation, came into \nfrequent use in adult and juvenile detention facilities beginning in the 1980s as the number \nof incarcerated persons increased dramatically in the United States.   \n92.  Over  the  last  approximately  ten  years,  however,  the  deleterious \npsychological impact of solitary confinement has become much clearer. \nPage 20 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 20 of 57\n\n \n93.  The  National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care  defines  solitary \nconfinement as โthe housing of an adult or juvenile with minimal to rare meaningful \ncontact with other individuals.โ11 \n94.  Similarly, the Association for the Prevention of Torture defines solitary \nconfinement as โkeeping an inmate alone in a cell for over 22 hours a day.โ12  That \norganization  has  concluded  that  โchildren,  persons  suffering  from  mental  health \ndisabilities, pregnant and nursing women, or women detained with their children should \nnever be subjected to solitary confinement.โ13   \n95.  Because juveniles are still developing psychologically, neurologically, and \nsocially, they are especially susceptible to psychological harm when they are isolated from \nother people.   \n96.  Juveniles in isolation face a significant risk of serious mental harm.  Solitary \nconfinement negatively impacts juveniles by perpetuating, worsening, or precipitating \nmental  health  concerns,  including  but  not  limited  to  post-traumatic  stress  disorders, \npsychosis, anxiety disorders, major depression, agitation, general lack of trust, suicidal \nideation, suicidal intent, self-mutilation, and suicidal behavior.  Research shows that almost \nall suicides within juvenile correctional facilities occur when the child is in some type of \n \n11 Position Statement: Solitary Confinement (Isolation), Natโl Commission on \nCorrectional Health Care (adopted April 10, 2016), https://www.ncchc.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Solitary-Confinement-Isolation.pdf. \n12 Solitary Confinement, Assโn for the Prevention of Torture (last visited Jan. 7, 2024), \nhttps://www.apt.ch/knowledge-hub/dfd/solitary-confinement.  \n13 Id. \nPage 21 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 21 of 57\n\n \nisolation and that the majority of juveniles who commit suicide had a history of being \nplaced in isolation. \n97.  These  mental  health  concerns  can  cause  long-term  harm.    Solitary \nconfinement  can  lead  to  chronic  conditions  like  depression,  which  in  teenagers  can \nmanifest as anger or as self-harm.  In addition, children who experience depression and \nanxiety in their teenage years are at a higher risk for presenting with these diagnoses again.  \nDamage associated with low self-esteem, vegetative features, and hopelessness associated \nwith depression can similarly be long standing.  Depression has a 10% or 15% mortality \nrate associated with it.  Solitary confinement increases the risk of suicide substantially \ncompared to the general population.   \n98.  Solitary confinement of juveniles can also lead to long-term trust issues with \nadults, including paranoia, anger, and hatred.  Unlikely to trust others, juveniles emerging \nfrom solitary have trouble forming therapeutic relationships necessary to address mental \nhealth concerns resulting from solitary confinement.   \n99.  Medical research on adolescent brains explains why  juveniles are more \nvulnerable to the risk of long-term harm.  In the adolescent brain, the connections between \nthe frontal lobe and the mid-brain have not fully developed.  If an adolescent is traumatized \nin certain ways, it can cause permanent changes in brain development and create a higher \nrisk of developing permanent psychiatric conditions like paranoia and anxiety.  Trauma \nfrom solitary confinement has a high likelihood of causing these permanent changes. \nPage 22 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 22 of 57\n\n \n100.  The risk of harm is made worse by the disproportionately high incidence of \npreexisting trauma and mental health concerns among juveniles in the criminal justice \nsystem.  Research shows that more than 60% of the youth in correctional settings are \nexperiencing major mental health challenges.14  Stress from isolation can compound past \ntrauma and exacerbate mental health challenges and disabilities.   \n101.  For those juveniles experiencing mental health challenges and disabilities, \nthe risk of harm is especially great.  People with mental health challenges and disabilities \noften experience cognitive deficits in their brain structure or biochemistry.  They often \nhave weakened defensive mechanisms, are at a higher risk for further mental health \ncomplications, and are more susceptible to significant trauma from isolation.  Trauma from \nisolation will be more long-lasting for those with mental health challenges or disabilities \nthan those without. \n102.  Studies have shown that solitary confinement lasting more than 15 days may \ncause irreversible damage.15 \n \n14 Minors in Custody โ Mental Health Issues, Child Crime Prevention & Safety Center (last \nvisited Jan. 7, 2024), https://childsafety.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/minors-in-custody-\nmental-health-\nissues.html#:~:text=Mental%20Health%20Concerns%20and%20Juvenile%20Justice&te\nxt=In%20fact%2C%20studies%20have%20shown,also%20have%20substance%20abuse\n%20issues. \n15 U.N.

The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care all have \ncalled on correctional facilities to halt the use of solitary confinement of juveniles. \n104.  In 2012, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry issued \na policy statement opposing the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in correctional \nfacilities  because  of  their  developmental  vulnerability,  noting  that  โ[t]he  potential \npsychiatric  consequences  of  prolonged  solitary  confinement  are  well  recognized  and \ninclude depression, anxiety, and psychosis.  Due to their developmental vulnerability, \njuvenile offenders are at particular risk of such adverse reactions.  Furthermore, the \nmajority of suicides in juvenile correctional facilities occur when the individual is isolated \nor in solitary confinement.โ16   \n105.  In  2014,  the  American  Medical  Association  issued  a  policy  statement \ndeclaring that it โoppose[d] the use of solitary confinement in juvenile correction facilities \nexcept for extraordinary circumstances when a juvenile is at acute risk of harm to self or \nothers.โ17   \n \n16 Solitary Confinement of Juvenile Offenders, American Academy of Child & \nAdolescent Psychiatry (approved by Council April 2012), \nhttps://www.aacap.org/aacap/policy_statements/2012/solitary_confinement_of_juvenile_\noffenders.aspx. \n17 Youth Solitary Confinement, the American Medical Association (last modified 2016), \nhttps://policysearch.ama-\nassn.org/policyfinder/detail/youth%20solitary%20confinement?uri=%2FAMADoc%2FH\nOD.xml-0-5016.xml. \nPage 24 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 24 of 57\n\n \n106.  In 2016, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care issued a \nposition statement concluding that โ[j]uveniles . . . should be excluded from solitary \nconfinement of any duration.โ18 \n107.  Acknowledging the high risk of mental health concerns as well as the higher \nrates of suicide and self-harm for youth in solitary confinement, in 2015 the United \nNationโs Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment \nor Punishment, Juan E. Mendez, concluded that juveniles, given their physical and mental \nimmaturity, should never be subjected to solitary confinement.  He called the imposition \nof  solitary  confinement  of  any  duration  on  juveniles  โcruel,  inhuman  or  degrading \ntreatment or punishment or even torture.โ19   \n108.  The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners \n(the Mandela Rules) state that solitary confinement should be prohibited in cases involving \nchildren.20 \n109.

The  Juvenile  Detention  Alternatives  Initiative  (โJDAIโ),  which  has \ndeveloped the most widely recognized set of national best practices on the use of solitary \nconfinement with juvenile populations, provides that solitary confinement can never be \nused for purposes of punishment or discipline and must be limited to less than four hours.21 \n111.  Having recognized in a 2012 report that โ[n]owhere is the damaging impact \nof  incarceration  on  vulnerable  children  more  obvious  than  when  it  involves  solitary \nconfinement,โ22 in 2016 the U.S. Department of Justice prohibited the use of solitary \nconfinement for juveniles in federal prisons. \n112.

Shortly  after  the  federal  ban  was  announced,  in  June  2016,  NCDPS \nannounced the end to solitary confinement for inmates in adult correctional facilities who \nwere under 18 years of age.  The Commissioner of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice \nat the time stated that  \n[t]he mental health, medical, educational, social, spiritual and \nemotional needs of these youth are numerous and complex . . \n. it is of paramount importance that, while these youth are in \nour care, their unique needs are accurately identified and \naddressed in the most effective way possible. . . . In keeping \nwith this commitment, we will eliminate the use of solitary \nconfinement within our under-18 population and have \ndeveloped a new program to address the aforementioned \nunique needs of this age group.24  \n  \nAt the time, North Carolina was one of only two states that tried 16- and 17-year-olds as \nadults.  \n114.  In 2015, with funding from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Bureau of \nJustice Assistance, NCDPS partnered with the Vera Institute of Justice (โVeraโ) โto help \nDPS reduce its use of segregation.โ  Veraโs โassistance included conducting an assessment \nof DPSโs use of segregation and providing ways to decrease its use.โ25   \n \n24 Letter from W.

In December 2016, Vera issued a final report titled โThe Safe Alternatives to \nSegregation Initiative:  Findings and Recommendations for the North Carolina Department \nof Public Safetyโ (the โVera Reportโ). \n116.  The  Vera  Report  noted  as  one  of  the  โKey  Reformsโ  that  during  its \nassessment โDPS began instituting several remarkable reforms, including: A prohibition \non the use of segregation for youth under 18 years of age.โ26 \n117.  Vera โapplaud[ed] this policy change, particularly in light of the research on \nthe deleterious effects of restrictive housing on incarcerated youth.โ27  Vera noted that โthe \nexisting studies have found that placing youth in restrictive housing is correlated with \nsignificantly higher rates of suicide as well as with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \ndepression, and future criminal activity.  The psychological harm caused by the solitary \nconfinement of young people in juvenile and criminal justice settings can exacerbate \npreexisting mental illness and increase the likelihood of subsequent drug abuse.โ28  \n118.  The Vera Report notes that โDPSโs new Youthful Offender Program goes \nbeyond  simply  prohibiting  putting  youth  in  restrictive  housing;  it  identifies  that, \nโ[s]upervision methods used with adults simply do not work with this population, and . . . \nsupervision  should  be  based  on  building  positive  relationships  utilizing  specific \n \nhttps://files.nc.gov/ncdps/documents/files/Vera%20Safe%20Alternatives%20to%20Segre\ngation%20Initiative%20Final%20Report.pdf. \n26 Id. \n27 Id. at 63. \n28 Id. \nPage 28 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 28 of 57\n\n \ncommunication skills and using a positive discipline approach to teach new behaviors and \nself-control.โโ29 \nDefendants are Fully Aware of the Risks of Solitary Confinement and Have \nDeliberately Chosen to Ignore Those Risks \n \n119.  Defendants know or should be aware of the risks of solitary confinement for \nyouth. \n120.  For example, President Obamaโs actions to prohibit solitary confinement of \njuveniles in federal custody โ and the research on which the prohibition was based โ were \nwidely reported in the media. \n121.  NCDPS announced in June 2016 the end to solitary confinement for inmates \nin adult correctional facilities who were under 18 years of age noting that โ[t]he mental \nhealth, medical, educational, social, spiritual and emotional needs of these youth are \nnumerous and complex.  It is important that while these youth are in our care, their unique \nneeds are accurately identified and addressed in the most effective way possible.โ30  \n122.  NCDPS also commissioned Vera to prepare an assessment of NCDPSโs use \nof solitary confinement and the Vera Report provided to NCDPS discussed the โdeleterious \neffects of restrictive housing on incarcerated youth.โ31 \n \n29 Id. at 67. \n30 State Prison System Announces End to Solitary Confinement for Inmates Under 18, \nNCDPS, supra note 23.   \n31 Vera Report at 63. \nPage 29 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 29 of 57\n\n \n123.  Defendant Lassiter recognized the risks of solitary confinement in a public \ninterview in November 2019:   \nWhat weโve learned was that just getting on them, getting in \ntheir  face  and  being  punitive  towards  them  really  wasnโt \nchanging their behavior.  We also used to lock kids in their \nroom for a long time, and put them in isolation.  We donโt do \nthat anymore.  We find that kids that are locked in their rooms, \ntheyโre not growing.  Theyโre not getting the therapy.  Theyโre \nnot trying to use the skills weโre trying to teach them.32 \n   \n124.  In  addition,  the  Council  for  Childrenโs  Rights  (โCFCRโ)  and  other \norganizations and defense attorneys have consistently raised with NCDPS throughout 2023 \nthe deplorable conditions that exist for children in the juvenile jails. \n125.  As early as January 31, 2023, CFCR raised concerns to Defendants regarding \nconditions  at  the  Cabarrus  Juvenile  Jail  that  were  โalarming.โ    CFCR  stated  it  was \nconcerned about โlack of educational services, little to no therapeutic services, length of \ntime between showers, limited to no time outside of their cells, [and] amount of time their \nflap is left down preventing any view outside of their cell.โ  CFCR also noted that โthe \nDeputies have reported the children are hungry when arriving to Court and during Court \nresulting in the Deputies obtaining food for the children.โ  Despite the alarming allegations, \nDefendants have failed to address the problem. \n126.  On  February  1,  2023,  the  Childrenโs  Alliance,  an  organization  in \nMecklenburg County made up of community members and organizations that works to \ncollectively identify, advocate, and find solutions for the challenges and barriers faced by \n \n32 The Dark Past of the Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center, supra note 3. \nPage 30 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 30 of 57\n\n \nchildren in the community, held a meeting to discuss the state of the juvenile jails and \noverall impact of Raise the Age.  Defendant Lassiter was asked to attend to provide a \ndetailed overview of the current conditions and barriers.  Defendant Lassiter attended the \nmeeting and discussed the staffing shortages at the juvenile jails. \n127.  On June 5, 2023, the Childrenโs Alliance held a meeting with, among others, \nDena Diorio (the Mecklenburg County Manager) and representatives from the Childrenโs \nAlliance and CFCR.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss whether Mecklenburg \nCounty would be willing to reopen the juvenile detention facility at Mecklenburg County \nJail North that closed at the end of 2022.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Lassiter \nattended the meeting and CFCR again raised to Defendant Lassiter that, among other \nthings, the children at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail were not being allowed out of their cells \nand were not receiving educational services. \n128.  On July 19, 2023, the Childrenโs Alliance held a meeting with, among others, \nDefendant Lassiter, the Interim Chief Court Counselor for Mecklenburg County from \nNCDPS, the Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, certain Mecklenburg County \ndistrict court judges, and representatives from the Childrenโs Alliance and CFCR.  The \npurpose of the meeting was to address how some children from Mecklenburg County in \ndetention at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail did not have beds and were sleeping on the floor.  \nCFCR again raised at that meeting that, among other things, the children at the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail were not being allowed out of their cells, were not receiving educational \nservices, and were not receiving therapeutic services.  Sheriff McFadden advised that he \nPage 31 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 31 of 57\n\n \nwas not reopening the juvenile detention facility at Jail North.  Defendant Lassiter reported \nthat NCDPS was understaffed. \n129.  On October 25, 2023, the Childrenโs Alliance held a meeting with, among \nothers,  Defendant  Lassiter,  Sheriff  McFadden,  Dena  Diorio,  representatives  of  the \nMecklenburg County District Attorneyโs office and Mecklenburg County NCDPS, and \nrepresentatives from the Childrenโs Alliance and CFCR.  The purpose of the meeting was \nto discuss concerns surrounding Mecklenburg County children who were being detained \nat the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in light of the conditions at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.   \n130.  Sheriff McFadden reiterated at the October 25, 2023 meeting that he was not \nreopening the juvenile detention center at Jail North.  CFCR again raised its concern that, \namong other issues, the children at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail were not being allowed out \nof  their  cells  and  were  not  receiving  educational  services.    Defendant  Lassiter \nacknowledged several investigations that had occurred into the conditions of the Cabarrus \nfacilities which resulted in corrective action plans.  Defendant Lassiter did not specify the \nlocation of the site investigations and reported to the group that conditions had improved.  \nUpon information and belief, Defendant Lassiter was describing visits by Disability Rights \nNorth Carolina and other organizations to the Cabarrus Juvenile Prison, not the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail.  \n131.  On December 18, 2023, The News & Observer in Raleigh published an \narticle reporting that NCDPS was โlocking minors up in rooms for days and weeks to cope \nPage 32 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 32 of 57\n\n \nwith a severe staffing shortage and other issue.โ33  The article described the story of a \nmother with a teen in a 35-bed detention center, upon information and belief the Dillon \nJuvenile Jail,34 who had been locked in his 7 by 9 foot room for more than 30 days nearly \n24 hours a day.  When confronted by the reporter, Defendant Lassiter admitted that \nDefendants are not letting the children in the state-run facilities out of their cells to cope \nwith staffing shortages. \n132.  In addition, defense attorneys for children detained and jailed in the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail have repeatedly put on the record in these childrenโs court cases that the \nchildren are not being allowed out of their cells, are not receiving educational services, and \nare not receiving therapeutic services.  A court counselor employed by NCDPS is assigned \nto each childโs case and is in the courtroom during every proceeding.  The NCDPS court \ncounselors  are  present  when  the  childrenโs  defense  attorneys  are  describing  these \nconditions at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail. \n133.

By virtue of complaints and meetings with advocates, Defendants have been \nrepeatedly put on notice of the substantial right of serious harm posed by its use of solitary \nconfinement.  Notwithstanding this notice, Defendants continue their regular use of solitary \nconfinement and ignore the complaints of the children and their counsel. \nDenying Juveniles in Solitary Confinement Appropriate Education Under North \nCarolina State Law Without Due Process \n \n135.  In addition to being placed at risk of serious harm, the children in solitary \nconfinement are also denied North Carolina state-mandated educational services without \ndue process. \n136.

Defendantsโ actions prevent children from attending school at the detention \ncenters  and  from  regularly  receiving  tutoring  or  other  individualized  instruction  or \nclassroom services.  These children are left without any regular educational instruction for \nas long as they are in solitary confinement.

Upon information and belief, Defendants make no meaningful effort to \nprovide children held in solitary confinement with educational instruction and therefore the \nchildren receive no education during their time in solitary confinement, which is often the \nentire time they are held at the jail. \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail \n140.  Although the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail can hold 62 children and has been \novercrowded for most, if  not  all  of  2023,  only a handful  of  children  have received \neducational services. \n141.  NCDPS employees at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail maintain a calendar showing \nhow many children received educational services each day.   \n142.  When the second semester started on January 3, 2023, NCDPS allowed \nchildren out of their cell at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail to attend school 12 days that month.  \nOn those 12 days, anywhere from 2 to 12 children attended school.  Many days only 3 or \n4 children attended school.  On the other days, no children attended school. \n143.  School attendance at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail only got worse from there.   \n144.  In February 2023, NCDPS allowed children to attend school 11 days that \nmonth.  On those 11 days, anywhere from 3 to 8 children attended school on any given \nday, with the exception of one day where 11 children attended school.  On most days, only \n3 or 4 children attended school.  On the other days, no children attended school. \n145.  By April and May 2023, NCDPS was hardly allowing any children out of \ntheir cells at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail to attend school.  In April 2023, NCDPS allowed \nPage 35 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 35 of 57\n\n \nchildren to attend school on 7 days.  Among those 7 days, on two days only 1 child attended \nschool and on two other days only 2 children attended school.  On the other days, no \nchildren attended school.  In May 2023, NCDPS allowed children to attend school at the \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail on 4 days.  On those days, 2, 4, 5, and 9 kids attended.  On the other \ndays, no children attended school. \n146.  In June 2023, summer school started at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.  NCDPS \nallowed children to attend school on 5 of the 15 school days.  On those days, 5 to 8 children \nwent to school each day.   \n147.  In July 2023, NCDPS allowed children to attend school on 3 days that month.  \nOn the other days, no children attended school. \n148.  Upon information and belief, the same children did not attend school on each \nof the days NCDPS allowed children out of their cell to receive educational services. \n149.  In  light  of  the  fact  that  the  Cabarrus  Juvenile  Jail  has  62  beds  and  is \nconsistently full, holding โschoolโ a few times a month for a few children means that most \nchildren are going to school a handful of times per month at most.   \n150.  Even when the children are allowed to go to school, school generally lasts a \nhalf hour to an hour at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.  At that rate, each child would have to \ngo to school 1000 โ 2000 days a year to reach 1,000 hours of instruction as mandated by \nthe NCDPS Education Policy. \n151.  The instruction that is provided during that one half hour to an hour of school \nis usually a lesson via video on a laptop that is provided to the children.   \nPage 36 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 36 of 57\n\n \nDillon Juvenile Jail \n152.  The children in the Dillon Juvenile Jail are not receiving educational services \nat all. \n153.  The  closest  thing  to  activities  even  resembling  educational  services  is \nDefendant NCDPS sliding crosswords and word search handouts under the doors of the \nchildrenโs cell a few times a week.   \n154.  The children in the Dillon Juvenile Jail are not going to classes or receiving \nany other type of instruction. \n155.  Outside of any formal educational services, the Dillon Juvenile Jail does not \neven have enough books to allow the children to exchange books when they have finished \nreading them. \n156.  It  is  well-established  that  education  in  correctional  facilities  reduces \nrecidivism rates.35     \n157.  Defendants have failed to provide the children at juvenile detention centers \nin North Carolina access to meaningful and comprehensive educational resources. \n158.  NCDPS employs the teachers at the juvenile detention centers, but upon \ninformation and belief, none of the children in detention are receiving full-time educational \nservices. \n \n35 See Lois M. Davis, Robert Bozick, Jennifer L. Steele, Jessica Saunders, and Jeremy N.V. \nMiles,  Evaluating  the  Effectiveness  of  Correctional  Education:    A  Meta-Analysis  of \nPrograms That Provide Education to Incarcerated Adults, RAND Corporation (2013), \nhttps://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR266.html. \nPage 37 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 37 of 57\n\n \n159.  Children incarcerated in juvenile detention centers in North Carolina are at \ncrucial points in their educational development.  Outside incarceration, cancellation of a \nsingle day of school causes school districts to mobilize and plan to make up every lost hour \nat the end of the year.  Yet when juveniles enter juvenile detention centers prior to their \ncases even being adjudicated, their educational needs are simply ignored for the weeks or \nmonths they are detained there.  They are thus deprived of education and denied the \neducation provided to other children their age in North Carolina. \n160.  As a proximate result of Defendantsโ repeated failures to provide an adequate \neducation to children in their custody, the children incarcerated in the juvenile detention \ncenters suffer compounding physical and psychological harm from their confinement and \nare falling behind in their academic development. \nNAMED PLAINTIFFSโ INDIVIDUAL ALLEGATIONS \nPlaintiff John Doe 1 \n161.   John Doe 1 is fifteen-years old and has been detained at the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail since November 2023.  The charges against him have not been adjudicated. \n162.  John Doe 1โs cell at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail is small.  It is just large enough \nfor him to be able to do pushups on the floor.  It has one bed, a sink, and a toilet.  It has a \nsmall window above the bed to the outside.  It has a metal door with a skinny window to \nthe interior of the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.     \nPage 38 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 38 of 57\n\n \n163.  John Doe 1 has been locked in his cell in isolation every day since he arrived \nat the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in November 2023.  On most days, he is in his cell for 23 \nhours and 50 minutes of the 24-hour day.   \n164.  The  only  times  the  guards  unlock  John  Doe  1โs  cell  and  let  him  out \ntemporarily are: \na.  A 10-minute shower.  John Doe 1 is allowed 10 minutes to take a shower.  If \nhe takes longer than 10 minutes, the next day is a โbird bathโ day.  A โbird \nbathโ is where John Doe 1 is not let out of his cell at all to shower and has to \nclean himself using the sink in his cell.  Some days John Doe 1 is not allowed \nto shower at all.  For example, on or about December 26, 2023, John Doe 1 \nwas not allowed to shower and was told it was because the jail was short on \nstaff. \nb.  Rec time.  Once a week John Doe 1 is supposed to get โrec timeโ where the \nguards let the children out of their cells a few children at a time and bring \nthem outside for 30 minutes.   \nc.  To get water.  John Doe 1 sometimes asks the guards to leave his cell to fill \nup his cup with water just to get out of his cell.  Up until recently some of the \nguards have allowed him out of his cell to get water, but he must immediately \nreturn to his cell after he gets water.  Now the children are not allowed to \nhave cups in their room and so there are no opportunities to leave the cell to \nget water.   \nPage 39 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 39 of 57\n\n \nd.  To clean.  John Doe 1 sometimes asks the guards if he can mop the floor or \nclean up so that he can get out of his cell.  The guards sometimes allow him \nto do this. \ne.  Phone calls.  On Tuesdays and Fridays John Doe 1 is allowed to come out of \nhis cell onto the pod to make a phone call.  He is generally limited to 10 \nminutes for his phone time.   \nf.  Discretionary releases.  On a few days, one guard has allowed John Doe 1 \nand others out of their cells, three children at a time, into the pod where they \ncan play games or watch tv for 30 minutes. \n165.  Other than a 10-minute shower, John Doe 1 was not allowed out of his cell \non Christmas day. \n166.  John Doe 1 and the children in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail eat their meals in \ntheir cell alone.  The jail staff cannot watch the children eat because each child is in his \nown cell and there is only a small window into the cell. \n167.  The Cabarrus Juvenile Jail guards bring breakfast to the children in their cells \nat 8 AM, lunch at 11 AM, and dinner at 4 PM.  John Doe 1 is often hungry because they \nbring dinner so early. \n168.  John Doe 1 has been allowed to have one visit so far with family. \n169.  The guards have punished children for actions as minor as attempting to talk \nto other children while in their cells.  In response, the guards often institute โTemporary \nConfinementโ for 3 days in which the guards flip the flap down on their door and window \nPage 40 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 40 of 57\n\n \nso that the children cannot see out their door or window.  This is in addition to the solitary \nconfinement the children at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail are already experiencing. \n170.  John Doe 1 is in 9th grade.  John Doe 1 has not received any educational \nservices or attended school since he arrived at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in November.  \nJohn Doe 1 understands that children have to be at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail for two to \nthree weeks before they can start receiving educational services.  Even when the children \nhave been at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail for this length of time, only a few children a day \nare allowed to receive educational services.   When the children are allowed out of their \ncell to go to school, the children are given a Chromebook and headphones and listen to a \nlesson on the computer.   \n171.  John Doe 1 has little to do in his cell.  He reads books, but if he finishes his \nbook, he cannot get a new one until the guards let him out of his cell, which can sometimes \nbe a full day or more.  He also does pushups, although there is little room in his cell to do \nthat.  He sometimes talks to the other children but risks getting in trouble and being placed \nin Temporary Confinement as a consequence.   \n172.  John Doe 1 is frustrated and angry that he has to be in his cell all day.  \nSometimes his frustration boils over and he just screams.  It is difficult to be in his cell the \nentire day because the other children are often screaming and yelling and banging on their \ncells.   \n173.  John Doe 1โs interaction with jail staff is limited.  At times, he has to bang \non this cell door and walls to try to get the staffโs attention.   \nPage 41 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 41 of 57\n\n \n174.  When John Doe 1 does get the jail staffโs attention, the staff at the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail tell John Doe 1 that they cannot let him out of his cell because they are short \non staff.   \n175.  John Doe 1 has been in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail previously in 2023.  Each \ntime he has been in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in 2023 he has experienced the same solitary \nconfinement conditions.   \nPlaintiff John Doe 2 \n176.  John Doe 2 is sixteen-years old and has been detained at the Cabarrus \nJuvenile Jail since November 2023.  The charges against him have not been adjudicated. \n177.  John Doe 2โs cell at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail is small.  It is approximately \nthe size of a medium sized closet in a house.  It has a bed on the wall and a sink and toilet.  \nIt has a small window on the door to the interior of the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.   \n178.  There are often bugs in John Doe 2โs cell.  He regularly kills ants and spiders \nin his cell and has been bit on the face by insects. \n179.  John Doe 2 has been locked in his cell in isolation every day since he arrived \nat the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in November 2023.  On most days, he is in his cell for 23 \nhours and 50 minutes of the 24-hour day.   \n180.  The  only  times  the  guards  unlock  John  Doe  2โs  cell  and  let  him  out \ntemporarily are: \na.  A 10-minute shower.  John Doe 2 is allowed 10 minutes to take a shower.  If \nhe takes longer than 10 minutes, he will get in trouble. \nPage 42 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 42 of 57\n\n \nb.  Rec time.  John Doe 2 last was allowed out of his cell for rec time weeks ago.  \nJohn Doe 2 has asked the jail staff to go outside, but the staff has told him \nthey are short staffed. \nc.  Phone calls.  On Mondays and Wednesdays John Doe 2 is allowed to come \nout of his cell onto the pod to make a phone call.  He is limited to ten minutes \nfor his phone time. \nd.  Discretionary releases.  Once in a while the guards will allow John Doe 2 out \nof his cell for 45 minutes to an hour into the pod.  John Doe 2 was allowed \nout of his cell for about an hour on or about December 23 or December 24, \nand he played board games. \n181.  Other than a 10-minute shower and a 10-minute telephone conversation with \nhis mother, John Doe 2 was not allowed out of his cell on Christmas day. \n182.  John Doe 2 eats all of his meals in his locked cell.  He is not supervised \nduring that time. \n183.  When the children get in trouble with the guards, the guards often institute \nโTemporary Confinement.โ  For example, if the children take longer than 10 minutes in \nthe shower or have too many books in their cells, the guards can institute Temporary \nConfinement.  Temporary Confinement can include putting the flap down over the window \nof a childโs door to his cell, turning off the water in his cell, and taking away a childโs \nblankets on his bed.   \nPage 43 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 43 of 57\n\n \n184.  John Doe 2 was put in Temporary Confinement once where the guards put \nthe flap on his window down so he could not see out his door to the interior of the jail and \nturned his water off so he could not flush his toilet. \n185.  Temporary  Confinement  is  in  addition  to  the  solitary  confinement  the \nchildren at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail are already experiencing. \n186.  John Doe 2 is in 10th grade.  John Doe 2 has not received any education \nservices or attended school since he arrived at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in November \n2023.  John Doe 2 was told that he might be able to receive educational services after \nJanuary 1, 2024.   \n187.  John Doe 2 has not received any mental health treatment or counseling since \nhe arrived at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in November despite being declared to not have \ncapacity in previous juvenile proceedings in District Court.  \n188.  John Doe 2 has little to do in his cell.  He reads books.  He also works out in \nthe little room he has in his cell by doing pushups, dips, and planks.  He sometimes writes \nsongs.  He spends a lot of time just lying in his bed. \n189.  John Doe 2 is depressed, mad, and sad that he has to be in his cell all day.  \nHe spends a lot of time thinking about what he can do differently when he gets out of jail \nand goes home. \n190.  The guards at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail tell John Doe 2 that they cannot let \nhim out of his cell because they are short on staff. \nPage 44 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 44 of 57\n\n \n191.  John Doe 2 has been in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail prior to 2023 and does not \nunderstand why he cannot come out of his cell like he was able to back then.   \nPlaintiff John Doe 3  \n192.   John Doe 3 is 17-years old and has been detained at the Cabarrus Juvenile \nJail since December 2023.  The charges against him have not been adjudicated. \n193.  John Doe 3โs cell at the Cabarrus juvenile jail is very small.  It has a bed, \nsink and toilet, small window to the outside, and a door with a small narrow rectangle \nwindow to the inside of the jail. \n194.  There is a flap that can be put up or down covering his window on his cell \ndoor.  About half the time the flap is down so that John Doe 3 cannot see out through the \nwindow on his door. \n195.  John Doe 3 has difficulty sleeping because some of the other children are \nyelling and beating on their doors at night. \n196.  John Doe 3 has been locked in his cell in isolation every day since he arrived \nat the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail in December 2023.  On most days he is in his cell for 23 hours \nand 50 minutes of the 24-hour day. \n197.  The only times the guards have unlocked John Doe 3โs cell and let him out \ntemporarily are: \na.  A 10 or 15-minute shower. \nb.  The guards let 4 children out of their cells one day, including John Doe 3, for \n10 to 15 minutes to watch tv in the pod. \nPage 45 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 45 of 57\n\n \nc.  To make a phone to his family.  John Doe 3 understands the policy to be that \nthe children get to make a 5 or 10-minute phone call to their family on \nTuesdays and Fridays, although he is not always allowed to make a call on \nthose days.   \n198.  John Doe 3 has not been allowed to have any recreational time outside since \nhe has been held at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail.  When John Doe 3 has asked the guards if \nthe children will be able to have rec time, they say no. \n199.  John Doe 3 receives three meals a day that are brought to and left in his cell.  \nJohn Doe 3 is nearly always hungry because the food does not taste good and he can barely \neat it. \n200.  John Doe 3โs interaction with jail staff is very limited since he is in his cell \nall day long.  If he needed to get a guardโs attention, he would try to bang on his cell door \nand hope the guard came to his cell. \n201.  John Doe 3 is in 11th grade.  John Doe 3 has not received any educational \nservices or attended school since he arrived at the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail. \n202.  John Doe 3 was held in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail previously in 2023.  John \nDoe 3 stated the conditions were largely the same back then, except he and the other \nchildren were usually not even allowed out of their cells to shower and were held in their \ncells 24 hours a day. \nPage 46 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 46 of 57\n\n \n203.  Now, John Doe 3 has very little do in his cell all day at the Cabarrus Juvenile \nJail.  He mainly sleeps and reads.  He spends most of his time thinking about what he can \ndo to make sure he is never put in a situation like this again. \n204.  John Doe 3 is often sad because of the conditions that he is being held in and \nbecause he is away from his family. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n205.  Plaintiffs John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3 bring this action on their \nown behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the following Class: \nAll juveniles who are currently, or in the future will be, \ndetained in a North Carolina juvenile detention facility \noperated by NCDPS (the โStatewide Classโ). \n \n \nIn the alternative, Plaintiffs seek to represent a Class consisting of: \nAll juveniles who are currently, or in the future will be, \ndetained in the Cabarrus Juvenile Jail (the โCabarrus Classโ). \n \n206.  The above classes are collectively referred to as the โClass.โ  If discovery or \nfurther investigation reveals that the Classes should be expanded or otherwise modified, \nthe named Plaintiffs reserve their right to amend the Class definitions or propose subclasses \nas necessary. \n207.  The Class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a) in that: \na.  Numerosity:  The  Class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.   The  juvenile  detention  centers  in North Carolina house  thousands of \nPage 47 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 47 of 57\n\n \njuveniles annually.  In 2021, 2,423 children were held at juvenile detention centers in North \nCarolina.  The Cabarrus Juvenile Jail detains hundreds of juveniles annually.  All juveniles \nincarcerated at the juvenile detention centers are at significant risk of unconstitutional \nsolitary confinement and unlawful denial of educational services.  Every month, Class \nmembers enter and exit the juvenile detention centers.  The names, case numbers, dates of \nconfinement, and all other relevant records are in possession of Defendants and are easily \nascertainable.  Many of these children are unable to file individual lawsuits because of their \nyouth, disabilities, or lack of financial resources. \nb.  Commonality: Common questions of law and fact arise from Defendantsโ \nconduct  described  herein.    Such  questions  are  common  to  all  Class  members  and \npredominate over any questions affecting individual Class members.  These include, but \nare not limited to the following:  \ni.  Whether Defendants permit and practice solitary confinement;  \nii.  Whether  Defendantsโ  policies  and  practices  of  placing  incarcerated \nchildren in solitary confinement have violated and will continue to violate \nClass membersโ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights; \niii.  Whether Defendants have unlawfully denied educational services to \nincarcerated children in violation of the Class membersโ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights;  \niv.  Whether, and to what extent, injunctive relief should be imposed on \nDefendants to prevent such conduct in the future; and \nPage 48 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 48 of 57\n\n \nv.  Whether Defendants should be enjoined from continuing their unlawful \npractices. \nc.  Typicality: Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the Class members.  \nAll Plaintiffs are incarcerated at juvenile detention centers in North Carolina, including the \nCabarrus Juvenile Jail, and have been subject to Defendantsโ challenged policies, practices, \nand procedures (or lack thereof).  Therefore, Plaintiffsโ claims arise from the same practices \nand course of conduct that give rise to the claims of Class members and are based on the \nsame legal theories. \nd.  Adequacy  of  Representation:  Plaintiffs,  their  representatives,  and  class \ncounsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and will diligently serve \nas Class representatives.  Plaintiffs do not have any antagonistic interests to the Class \nmembers and seek injunctive relief on a class-wide basis to remedy class injuries and enjoin \nDefendantsโ  unlawful  conduct.    Furthermore,  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  members  are \nrepresented by competent counsel who are experienced in civil rights and class action \nlitigation.  \ne.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(1)(A) \nbecause the prosecution of separate actions by individual children would create a risk of \ninconsistent  and  varying  adjudications,  which  in  turn,  would  establish  incompatible \nstandards of conduct for the juvenile detention centers.   \nf.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) \nbecause Defendants have acted, or failed to act, on grounds generally applicable to the \nPage 49 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 49 of 57\n\n \nClass as a whole, and the injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will \napply to all members of the Class. \ng.  This  action  is  also  maintainable  pursuant  to  Rule  23(b)(3)  because  the \ncommon questions of law and fact overwhelmingly predominate in this case.  The common \nquestions of law and fact listed above are dispositive questions in the case of every member \nof the Class.  The question of liability can therefore be determined on a class-wide basis.  \nClass-wide treatment of liability is a far superior method of determining the content and \nlegality  of  Defendantsโ  policies  and  practices  than  individual  suits  by  hundreds  or \nthousands of North Carolina residents. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT:  VIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n(brought on behalf of the Statewide Class, or, \nin the alternative, on behalf of the Cabarrus Class) \n \n208.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 207 above are incorporated herein. \n209.  When Defendants take a child into custody, they assume a duty under the \nFourteenth Amendment of  the U.S.  Constitution  to protect  the  child from  harm and \nsubstantial risk of serious harms. \n210.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class have substantive Due Process rights that \ninclude, but are not limited to:  the right to be free from and protected from physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm; the right to necessary treatment, care, and services; the \nPage 50 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 50 of 57\n\n \nright not to deteriorate physically, psychologically, or emotionally while in custody; and \nthe right to be free from substantial risks of the above-mentioned harms. \n211.  Defendants  maintain  a  policy,  custom,  and  practice  of  using  solitary \nconfinement as the default confinement method in juvenile detention centers in a manner \nthat lacks any penological or justifiable government purpose and is grossly inconsistent \nwith established clinical and legal consensus that youth solitary confinement is profoundly \nharmful. \n212.  Defendants further  compound the harm to  children detained at juvenile \ndetention centers by denying them any meaningful education at critical points in their \nacademic development. \n213.  These practices are imposed on juveniles with no legitimate government \npurpose or penological purpose and violate public policy and law in other regards. \n214.  Defendants are aware of the harm and risks of harm these practices cause to \nchildren at the juvenile detention centers, yet have consistently applied the same harmful \npolicies  and  practices  and  failed  to  make  any  changes  to  improve  the  conditions.  \nDefendantsโ response to this harm and risk of harm, or lack of a response, is objectively \nunreasonable and shows a deliberate, knowing, or reckless disregard for the consequences. \n215.  Defendantsโ actions were taken under color of state law and within the scope \nof their employment.  This deprivation under color of state law is actionable under and may \nbe redressed by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nPage 51 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 51 of 57\n\n \n216.  The conditions described in this Complaint violate the Due Process rights of \nthe children detained at juvenile detention centers in North Carolina operated by NCDPS. \n217.  Defendants have continuously violated the law, as detailed in this Complaint.  \nAs a proximate result of Defendantsโ actions, Plaintiffs, as well as the Class they represent, \nhave endured and continue to suffer serious and irreparable physical, psychological, and \nemotional injuries. \n218.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described \nherein.  The relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  \nUnless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject Plaintiffs and the Class \nto a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT:  VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n(42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n(brought on behalf of the Statewide Class, or,  \nin the alternative, on behalf of the Cabarrus Class) \n \n219.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 218 above are incorporated herein. \n220.  Furthermore, the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits cruel \nand unusual punishment on convicted and incarcerated juveniles, including by exercising \ndeliberate indifference to substantial risks of serious harm, inhumane conditions, and \ninadequate care. \n221.  The above-described conditions of solitary confinement at juvenile detention \ncenters across the state of North Carolina and Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and \nomissions have inflicted, and continue to inflict, grave and inhumane deprivations, injuries, \nPage 52 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 52 of 57\n\n \nand risks to the Plaintiffs as well as the Class, all of which violate contemporary standards \nof decency and are intolerable in todayโs society. \n222.  The risks of harm to Plaintiffs and the Class as a result of the above-described \nconditions at the juvenile detention centers and Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and \nomissions are obvious and known to Defendants. \n223.  Moreover, Defendants were notified  of  these  risks  by others and, thus, \nactually knew of the risks of harm to Plaintiffs and the Class as a result of the above-\ndescribed conditions of confinement at the juvenile detention centers and Defendantsโ \npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions. \n224.  Despite actual knowledge of the obvious risks of harm to Plaintiffs and the \nClass at the juvenile detention centers, Defendants have disregarded these excessive risks \nto the health and safety of Plaintiffs and the Class and have failed to rectify the conditions \nof confinement at the juvenile detention centers or to make preventative changes to their \npolicies and procedures.   \n225.  As  a  result,  Defendants  have  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nexcessive  risk  of  harm  to  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  as  a  result  of  the  conditions  of \nconfinement  at  the  juvenile  detention  centers  operated  by  NCDPS  and  Defendantsโ \npolicies, practices, acts, and omissions complained of herein.   \n226.  By imposing solitary confinement, Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs and \nthe Class to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \nPage 53 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 53 of 57\n\n \n227.  Defendants have acted or failed to act and are continuing to act or fail to act \nunder color of state law.   \n228.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the harms described \nherein.  The relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.  \nUnless enjoined by the Court, Defendants will continue to subject Plaintiffs and the Class \nto a substantial risk of serious harm, in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nTEMPORARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \n(42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n(brought on behalf of the Statewide Class, or,  \nin the alternative, on behalf of the Cabarrus Class) \n \n229.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 to 228 above are incorporated herein. \n230.  Based on the allegations contained in the previous paragraphs, Plaintiffs \nclaim they are entitled to a Preliminary and Permanent Injunction. \n231.  Plaintiffsโ Eighth and Fourteenth  Amendment rights have been  violated \nunder color of state law. \n232.  To  end  an  ongoing  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ  rights,  Defendants  must  be \nimmediately restrained from placing Plaintiffs and the Class in solitary confinement as \npunishment, discipline, or because there is inadequate staffing, and from placing Plaintiffs \nin solitary confinement for any reason other than a rare and temporary response to prevent \nimminent and serious physical harm to persons due to a juvenileโs behavior. \nPage 54 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 54 of 57\n\n \n233.  To make Plaintiffs whole and restore their rights, Defendants must also be \nenjoined from taking further action to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to humane treatment \nwhile awaiting adjudication in the form of placing them in solitary confinement. \n234.  Plaintiffs and the Class have no adequate remedy at law and only injunctive \nrelief can restore their constitutionally protected rights and ensure the protection of their \nrights in the future. \nREQUESTS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of all others similarly \nsituated, respectfully request that this Court: \na.  Issue an Order that this action be maintained as a class action, appointing \nPlaintiffs as representatives of the Statewide Class or, in the alternative, the \nCabarrus Class; \nb.  Issue an order appointing the undersigned attorneys as Class Counsel in this \naction; \nc.  Issue an order declaring that Defendantsโ acts and omissions violate Plaintiffsโ \nand the Classโs rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; \nd.  Grant preliminary and permanent injunctive relief eliminating the use of solitary \nconfinement for juveniles for any purpose other than a rare and temporary \nresponse to prevent imminent and serious physical harm to persons due to a \njuvenileโs behavior; \nPage 55 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 55 of 57\n\n \ne.  Issue such further injunctive relief as necessary to rectify the unconstitutional \nuse of solitary confinement; \nf.  Issue an Order retaining jurisdiction of this matter to enforce the terms of the \nCourtโs orders and appoint a neutral monitor to ensure compliance with the \ninjunctive relief; \ng.  Issue  an  order  enjoining  Defendants  and  their  officers,  agents,  affiliates, \nsubsidiaries, servants, employees and all other persons or entities in active \nconcert or privity or participation with them, from taking retaliatory action \nagainst  Plaintiffs  for  bringing  this  lawsuit,  or  against  any  juveniles  in \nDefendantsโ custody for their past or future expression of support of Plaintiffs \nor opposition to Defendantsโ use of solitary confinement on juveniles; \nh.  Award payment of Plaintiffsโ reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs associated \nwith this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1988, et seq. or under any other relevant \nauthority; and  \ni.  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nDated this 8th day of January, 2024. \n[signatures on next page] \n \nPage 56 of 57 \nCase 1:24-cv-00017   Document 1   Filed 01/08/24   Page 56 of 57\n\n \n \nNELSON MULLINS RILEY & SCARBOROUGH \nLLP \n \n/s/  Robert L.
