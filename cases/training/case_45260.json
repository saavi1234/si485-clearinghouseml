This suit challenges the Executive’s fundamental transgressions of the Constitution, \nthe Clean Air Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EPA has remarkably managed to (1) unconstitu-\ntionally delegate the sovereign authority it actually possesses to private special interest groups while \n(2) simultaneously arrogating to itself powers never given to it by Congress. The governmental pow-\ners that Congress gave the agency have thus been illegal given away to non-governmental groups, \nwhile those that Congress never saw fit to give the agency have been unlawfully usurped. The State \nseeks to remedy these violations through this suit. \n2.  Along the way, EPA officials have lost sight of the agency’s actual environmental \nmission, and instead decided to moonlight as a social justice warriors fixated on race. To that end, \nEPA officials declare compliance with environmental law and actual environmental standards is not \nenough: to avoid loss of federal funds, States must also satisfy EPA’s increasingly warped vision of \n“environmental justice” and “equity.”  \n3.  EPA is doing so by putatively enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(“Civil  Rights  Act”).  But  Title  VI  “prohibits  only  intentional  discrimination.”  Alexan-\nder v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280 (2001). All of EPA’s relevant actions, however, have nothing to do \nwith intentional racial discrimination (which is not even alleged). Instead, EPA is relying on a “dis-\nparate impact” theory to expand its authority far past enforcement of actual environmental stand-\nards into imposing its amorphous vision of “justice” upon the American public. \n4.  To be sure, the State does not quarrel in the slightest with Title VI’s requirement that \nit refrain from engaging in intentional racial discrimination. Discrimination on the basis of race is \nfundamentally antithetical to the Fourteenth Amendment: “Racial classifications are simply too per-\nnicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,” Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270 (2003) (cleaned up).  \n2 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 3 of 57 PageID #:  3\n5.  The State, however, objects to Defendants’ attempts to impose disparate-impact-\nbased requirements on the State—which effectively compel the State to discriminate on the basis of \nrace. See, e.g., Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 594 (2009) (Scalia, J., concurring) (Disparate-impact re-\nquirements “not only permit[] but affirmatively require[] [race-based discrimination] when a disparate-\nimpact violation would otherwise result.”). \n6.  Activities that would be perfectly lawful under environmental law are thus now \nthreatened because EPA believes those activities occur proximate to the “wrong” racial groups. \nEPA does not bother to deny that it would be unconcerned if the exact same emissions occurred in are-\nas with differing racial demographics. But EPA has nonetheless arrogated to itself the authority to \ndecide whether otherwise-lawful emissions are affecting the “right” racial groups. Put succinctly, \nEPA frequently does not care about the content of air and water emissions, but only the color of the \nskin of those proximate to them. That dystopian nightmare violates the Civil Rights Act. \n7.  Nor would the intended beneficiaries of EPA’s actions have much to celebrate: EPA \nintends to render large swaths of them unemployed not because of any threatened violation of envi-\nronmental law, but instead because EPA believes that “environmental justice” is best served by inflict-\ning a disparate economic injury on them in the form of substantial unemployment—all to prevent \nputative disparate environmental impacts that would otherwise be completely lawful if they affected \ncommunities with different racial compositions. EPA’s paternalistic view that Louisiana citizens are \nbest served by the agency disproportionately rendering them unemployed is as dubious as it is illegal. \n8.  EPA is further not content to impose only those requirements actually found in its \nregulations. Instead, EPA officials have been perfectly clear that they intend to impose mandates \nfound nowhere in their actual regulations, and instead invented wholecloth by mid-level employees on \nan ad hoc basis. Such an approach would be obviously ultra vires in any context, as agencies may only \n3 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 4 of 57 PageID #:  4\nimpose legal requirements by undergoing the processes mandated by the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”). \n9.  That approach is even more profoundly unlawful here. Title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct. Section 602 of that act specifically provides that “[n]o such rule, regulation, or order [imple-\nmenting Title VI] shall become effective unless and until approved by the President.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 \n(emphasis added). But the wholecloth inventions of mid-level EPA bureaucrats have not even argu-\nably been approved by the President, and thus are unequivocally without legal force.  \n10.  Despite the patent illegality of these unratified, extra-regulatory requirements, EPA \nhas been perfectly clear that it intends to impose them on the State. Because the plain language of \nSection 602 and the APA is apparently insufficient to stop EPA’s unlawful attempts to impose in-\nvented mandates, the State seeks a judgment from this Court that will do so.  \n11.  EPA first sought to use Clean Air Act permits for two facilities in St. John Parish: \n(1) the Denka Performance Elastomer LLC - Pontchartrain Plant (“Denka Facility”) and the FG LA \nLLC facility (the “Formosa Facility”) as the vehicle for its illegality. Those facilities provide hundreds \nof jobs in an economically struggling community.  \n12.  The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) granted permits \nunder the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) to both facilities on January 6, 2020, pursuant to its permitting \nauthority under CAA Title V, which establishes a cooperative federalism framework.  \n13.  EPA has not taken issue with substance of those permit grants under the CAA. In-\ndeed, EPA has admitted that LDEQ “follow[ed] the environmental law” in granting the permits. \nInstead, EPA has employed its authority under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to challenge unde-\nfined parts of the process used to issue those permits. \n4 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 5 of 57 PageID #:  5\n14.  EPA made clear that it seeks to impose its illegality statewide, including on permits in \nthis district. Indeed, EPA recently demanded that LDEQ provide a vast quantity of information \nabout its activities statewide. \n15.  In doing so, EPA has dramatically overstepped its bounds, violating both the Consti-\ntution and the statutory provisions at issue. Defendants’ legal violations here broadly fall within \nthree categories. \n16.  First Set of Violations: Private Non-Delegation Doctrine. First, EPA has violat-\ned the private non-delegation doctrine by delegating sovereign governmental powers to private spe-\ncial interest groups.  \n17.  Title VI mandates that no enforcement action may be “taken until the department or \nagency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the \n[applicable Title VI] requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.” \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 (emphasis added). EPA’s Title VI regulations similarly mandate that the agency \n“shall attempt to resolve complaints informally whenever possible.” 40 C.F.R. § 7.120 (emphasis added). \n18.  Title VI and EPA’s regulations thus mandate that EPA attempt to secure compliance \nthrough (a) “voluntary means” and (b) “informally” whenever such measures might be effective. See \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; 40 C.F.R. § 7.120. \n19.  EPA, however, has partially given away its power to achieve compliance through \nvoluntary compliance and informal means—and thus abdicated its duty to do so. Specifically, EPA \nhas given private organizations the power to veto continuation of informal resolution discussion that \nlast more than 180 days—even where EPA itself believes that it is still possible (or even likely) to \nachieve voluntary compliance through informal procedures, and despite EPA publicly acknowledg-\ning that 180 days is often not enough time to resolve complex environmental matters. \n5 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 6 of 57 PageID #:  6\n20.  EPA acquiesced to a judgment and amended judgment with the Sierra Club, Califor-\nnians  for  Renewable  Energy,  and  other  organizations  (hereinafter,  “Private  Special  Interest \nGroups”), see Californians for Renewable Energy v. EPA, No. 4:15-cv-3292 (N.D. Cal. June 13, 2018) \n(Doc. 116); id. (Doc. 145) (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2020) requiring EPA to “issue preliminary findings and \nany recommendations for voluntary compliance, or otherwise resolve the complaint, within 180 days \nof the date of acceptance.”  \n21.  EPA’s agreement to such 180-day timelines was a promise that the agency could, at \nbest, rarely keep. EPA itself has previously admitted that 180-day deadlines were “unrealistic,” “in-\nflexible,” and “impracticable given the inherent scientific complexity associated with determining \nwhich and how populations are impacted by environmental pollutants; the number of discrimination \nallegations and theories that may be asserted in any one complaint under Title VI or the other non-\ndiscrimination statutes; and the volume of the complaints received.” EPA, Nondiscrimination in Pro-\ngrams or Activities Receiving Federal Assistance from the Environmental Protection Agency, 80 Fed. Reg. 77284, \n77,287 (Dec. 14, 2015). \n22.  Thus, by EPA’s own admission, it frequently cannot reach a rational, non-arbitrary \ndetermination within 180 days as to whether: (1) compliance can “be secured by voluntary means,” \nas Title VI requires, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1, and whether issues can be resolved “informally,” as its \nown regulations require, 40 C.F.R. § 7.120. \n23.  But through the regulation and the acquiesced judgment, EPA has delegated away its \nauthority to continue informal proceedings beyond 180 days unless the Private Special Interest \nGroups consent. In doing so, EPA has given non-governmental actors control over how federal execu-\ntive power is exercised. Specifically, EPA has delegated away its authority to continue seeking compli-\nance through voluntary/informal means beyond 180 days if the Private Special Interest Groups de-\ncide to veto such action. \n6 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 7 of 57 PageID #:  7\n24.  A simple example demonstrates the inversion here. Under EPA’s view of its govern-\ning legal authority, if President Biden expressly commanded EPA to continue informal negotiations \nbeyond 180 days, but the Private Special Interest Groups exercised their veto, EPA would be legally \ncompelled to obey the Private Special Interest Groups over a contrary presidential order. Absent \ninvalidation of these unconstitutional delegations, EPA is subordinate to private groups even at the \nexpense of the President’s authority. \n25.  The dispute about the Denka and Formosa Facilities bears this out. EPA has been \nperfectly clear in negotiations with the State that it was willing—and desired to—to continue infor-\nmal proceedings beyond 180 days and thus believed that voluntary/informal resolution was still rea-\nsonably achievable. But EPA was equally clear that it was submitting the matter to the Private Spe-\ncial Interest Groups for their approval and, if their veto was exercised, EPA would abide by their \ndecision as to whether EPA should extend informal negotiations.  \n26.  On March 2, 2023, EPA specifically told State officials that that continued informal \nnegotiations were dependent on securing the approval of the Private Special Interest Groups and \nthat the informal proceedings would end without that approval. \n27.  On March 8, 2023, EPA notified State officials that it had secured the approval of \nthe Private Special Interest Groups and thus could exercise its own judgment that continued infor-\nmal negotiations were warranted. EPA further made clear that securing the Private Special Interest \nGroups’ agreement/non-veto came at a price: EPA shared with the groups drafts of proposed \nagreements it had sent to the State to resolve the Title VI complaints. EPA made clear the quid-pro-\nquo by telling State officials that the agency “did not think it was a very high price … in order to get \na 120-day extension for the purpose of continuing what we think is a very productive discussion \n[and] negotiation.” \n7 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 8 of 57 PageID #:  8\n28.  These through exchanges, EPA officials removed any possible ambiguity as to the \nsituation here: private groups have been given control over how federal governmental power is to be \nexercised. Absent the consent of the Private Special Interest Groups, EPA would have been com-\npelled to terminate informal negotiations even if the agency itself believed that it was wiser govern-\nmental policy to continue them (as its officials made clear was the case). \n29.  This delegation of veto power to the Private Special Interest Groups squarely vio-\nlates the private non-delegation doctrine. For nearly a century the Supreme Court has made clear \nthat conferring governmental powers on private organizations is “is unknown to our law, and is ut-\nterly inconsistent with the constitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.” A.L.A. Schechter Poul-\ntry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537 (1935). \n30.  The Fifth Circuit has reiterated these principles recently: “While the [Supreme] Court \nhas allowed limited delegations of authority to government agencies, it has set its face against giving \npublic power to private bodies.” National Horsemen’s Benevolent & Protective Ass’n v. Black, 53 F.4th \n869, 880 (5th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted) (invalidating statute under the private non-delegation doc-\ntrine). Indeed, “[n]ot content merely to reject the idea, the Court has also called it insulting names.” \nId.; see also id. (“[C]onferring power on private persons is ‘legislative delegation in its most obnoxious \nform’ (quoting Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936)). \n31.  To be sure, private organizations can serve a role in the administrative process as \nlong as they are subordinate to the agency: “Congress may formalize the role of private parties in pro-\nposing regulations so long as that role is merely as an aid to a government agency that retains the \ndiscretion to approve, disapprove, or modify them. If the private entity does not function subordi-\nnately to the supervising agency, the delegation of power is unconstitutional.” Id. at 881 (cleaned up) \n(citation omitted)). \n8 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 9 of 57 PageID #:  9\n32.  Here EPA has turned these principles on their head: The Private Special Interest \nGroups do “not function subordinately” to EPA, but rather EPA has rendered itself subordinate to \nthem: EPA may not exercise governmental power in a manner it deems prudent unless it secures the \napproval of those private groups.  \n33.  By rendering itself subordinate to private organizations as to how its governmental \nenforcement authority should be exercised, EPA has acted in a manner “‘utterly inconsistent’” with \nthe Constitution. Id. at 880 (quoting Schechter Poultry, 295 U.S. at 537). And to the extent that subor-\ndination flows from an “arbitrary” and “unrealistic” self-imposed regulatory deadline, that deadline \nitself is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \n34.  Second Set of Violations: Imposing Disparate-Impact-Based Requirements In \nContravention of Title VI. Second, EPA’s attempt to impose disparate-impact-based requirements \nunder Title VI on the State (and innumerable other entities) violates Title VI itself and exceeds the \nExecutive’s authority under that statute and the Constitution. Title VI bans only intentional discrimi-\nnation. The attempt by EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and other agencies to impose \ndisparate-impact-based liability under Title VI squarely violates that provision and the Constitution, \nand further exceeds the authority that the Executive possesses under Title VI. \n35.  The Supreme “Court has consistently recognized a distinction between claims of dis-\ncrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination based on disparate impact.” \nRaytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 52 (2003).  \n36.  “Disparate treatment [i.e., intentional discrimination] is the most easily understood \ntype of discrimination. The [decision-maker] simply treats some people less favorably than others \nbecause of their race, color, religion, sex, or other protected characteristic. Liability in a disparate-\ntreatment case depends on whether the protected trait ... actually motivated the [decision-maker] de-\ncision.” Id. \n9 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 10 of 57 PageID #:  10\n37.  “By contrast, disparate-impact claims ‘involve [challenged] practices that are facially \nneutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than \nanother and cannot be justified by business [or policy] necessity. Under a disparate-impact theory of \ndiscrimination, a facially neutral … practice may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence \nof the [decision-maker’s] subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a ‘disparate-treatment’ \ncase.” Id. at 52-53 (cleaned up) (citations omitted). \n38.  These approaches are fundamentally distinct, and “courts must be careful to distin-\nguish  between  these  theories.”  Id. at  53;  see  also  Ricci,  557  U.S.  at  595-96  (noting  intentional-\ndiscrimination and disparate-impact theories are often at “war” with each other). \n39.  “It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.” League of United Latin Am. Citi-\nzens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 511 (2006) (Roberts, C.J., concurral). But far from having any apparent \naversion to such sordidness, EPA has an unmistakable appetite for it. And Defendants are employ-\ning their putative authority to impose disparate-impact-based requirements under Title VI to serve \nthose distasteful ends. \n40.  EPA’s policies squarely mandate “divvying us up by race.” Id. EPA divides racial \ngroups into favored and disfavored groups. As to the latter, “mere” compliance with all existing en-\nvironmental standards is sufficient to grant permits or approvals. In other words, for those without \npreferential status, compliance with all environmental standards is sufficient to satisfy environmental law. \nBut for those higher up in EPA’s intersectional pyramid, EPA will impose additional mandates \nbased purely on the racial composition of the relevant groups, rather any race-neutral standard of \nenvironmental protection. \n41.  Nor does EPA make any pretext of even-handedness: only disparate impacts affect-\ning certain racial groups concern the agency. Those groups further down the agency’s intersectional \npyramid can at best expect apathy from the agency. \n10 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 11 of 57 PageID #:  11\n42.  None of this is subtle or disputed: EPA loudly asserts that it has authority to impose \nheightened requirements based purely on the racial composition of the individuals at issue, and will \nfervently engage in the “sordid business [of] divvying us up by race,” unless courts prevent them \nfrom doing so. Id. Because Title VI provides EPA no authority to engage in the sort of intentional \nracial discrimination, this Court should do so. \n43.  Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act provides the operative prohibition for Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. \n44.  The Supreme Court long ago held that Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimina-\ntion. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). Indeed, it has long been “beyond dis-\npute … that § 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280 \n(2001). Accord Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293 (1985) (“Title VI itself directly reached only in-\nstances of intentional discrimination.”). \n45.  Standing alone Section 601 thus unequivocally does not provide any basis for impos-\ning disparate-impact-based mandates. Its prohibition is purely for intentional discrimination. \n46.  Defendants have instead looked to Section 602 to foist disparate-impact require-\nments on the States and other federal grant recipients. That section provides the agencies giving “fi-\nnancial assistance … by way of grant, loan, or contract … [are] authorized and directed to effectuate \n[Section 601] … by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. \n47.  The question thus becomes whether agencies can “effectuate” Section 601—a provi-\nsion prohibiting only intentional discrimination—by creating an entirely distinct theory of liability in the \nform of disparate-impact requirements. \n11 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 12 of 57 PageID #:  12\n48.  The Supreme Court has never resolved this issue, and has explicitly recognized it as \nan open one. The Court in Sandoval thus “assume[d] for the purposes of deciding this case that the \nDOJ and DOT regulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are \nvalid.” Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 282. That assumption has never been tested again in the Supreme Court.  \n49.  Sandoval held that there was no private cause of action to enforce any disparate-\nimpact regulations issued under Section 602, however. Id. at 293. As a likely result of the unavailabil-\nity of private enforcement, this issue has not reached the Supreme Court again. \n50.  Under straightforward interpretive principles and precedent, however, Defendants \nlack authority under Section 602 to impose disparate-impact based mandates. \n51.  Defendants’ authority under Section 602 is limited solely to “effectuat[ing]” Section \n601. And it is incontestable that Section 601 itself only bars intentional discrimination. Defendants \ncannot “effectuate” Section 601 by transmuting it into something that it unequivocally is not. That is \nan act of mythological alchemy, not agency “effectuation” of a statute. \n52.  The Supreme Court has “consistently recognized [the] distinction between claims of \ndiscrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination based on disparate im-\npact.” Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 52.  \n53.  The Executive cannot effectuate an intentional-discrimination standard by obliterat-\ning one of its crucial features and expanding it to encompass something that the Supreme Court has \nlong recognized it is not. \n54.  The Executive’s lack of authority to “effectuate” Section 601 by imposing disparate-\nimpact-based requirements is underscored by the fact that intentional-discrimination and disparate-\nimpact standards are not merely (and fundamentally) distinct from each other, but also in substan-\ntial—often even irreconcilable—tension with one other. “[D]isparate-impact provisions place a ra-\ncial thumb on the scales, often requiring [decision-makers] to evaluate the racial outcomes of their \n12 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 13 of 57 PageID #:  13\npolicies, and to make decisions based on (because of) those racial outcomes. That type of racial decisionmaking \nis, as the Court explains, discriminatory.” Ricci, 557 U.S. at 595-96 (2009) (Scalia, J., concurring) (em-\nphasis added). Intentional-discrimination and disparate-impact standards are thus often at “war” \nwith each other. Id. \n55.  Given that “war” between the standards, an agency cannot “effectuate” Title VI’s \nprohibition on intentional discrimination by imposing disparate-impact-based mandates. That is akin \nto “effectuating” the United States’ policy of supporting Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine War by giv-\ning arms to Russia. \n56.  The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Kamps v. Baylor University, 592 F. App’x 282 (5th Cir. \n2014) all-but compels a conclusion that Defendants’ disparate-impact-based standards violate Title \nVI.  \n57.  Kamps rejected Department of Energy (“DOE”) regulations purporting to create dis-\nparate impact liability for individuals with disabilities. Kamps v. Baylor Univ., 592 F. App’x 282, 285 \n(5th Cir. 2014). The Fifth Circuit reasoned that “[w]hen Congress wants to allow disparate impact \nclaims, it uses particular language,” and cited to such particular language in Title VII and the Age Dis-\ncrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”). Id. (emphasis added). But the “ADA lack[ed] any such \nlanguage,” and hence DOE regulations could not create disparate-impact-based requirements. Id. \nCrucially here, Title VI also has no such “particular language.” \n58.  Kamps further explicitly recognized as much: “the ADA’s prohibition is almost identical \nto Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits only intentional discrimination.” Id. (emphasis \nadded). \n59.  Under the reasoning of Kamps, regulations imposing disparate-impact liability under \nTitle VI are invalid. \n13 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 14 of 57 PageID #:  14\n60.  The invalidity of Defendants’ disparate-impact Title VI regulations is further sup-\nported by the major questions doctrine. That doctrine recognizes that “[e]xtraordinary grants of reg-\nulatory authority are rarely accomplished through ‘modest words,’ ‘vague terms,’ or ‘subtle devices.’” \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2609 (2022). Here, Congress carefully restricted Title VI’s \nprohibition purely to intentional discrimination. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 280. \n61.  Defendants’  contention  that  the  power  to  “effectuate”  that  intentional-\ndiscrimination  prohibition  by  imposing  disparate-impact-based  liability  is  precisely  the  sort  of \n“hid[ing] elephants in mouseholes” reasoning that the doctrine forbids. Whitman v. Am. Trucking As-\nsociations, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). \n62.  Indeed, the question of whether Section 602 authorizes Defendants to impose dis-\nparate-impact-based requirements satisfies all three of the independent triggers for the major ques-\ntions doctrine: (1) it involves a “matter of great political significance,” (2) “it seeks to regulate a sig-\nnificant portion of the American economy,” and (3) it “intrud[es] into an area that is the particular \ndomain of state law,” i.e., commanding states to regulate in a manner that avoids disparate impacts. \nWest Virginia, 142 S. Ct. at 2620-21 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (cleaned up) (collecting cases). \n63.  But even if Section 602 could bear Defendants’ construction under ordinary princi-\nples of statutory interpretation (and the major questions doctrine notwithstanding), Defendants’ at-\ntempt to bind the States to disparate-impact-based requirements is unlawful because it exceeds the \nfederal government’s power under the Constitution. In particular, it violates the Spending Clause, \nwhich demands inter alia that if the federal government wishes to impose conditions on the States \nthrough spending programs—such as through Title VI—then those conditions must be “unambig-\nuous” in the statute itself. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-08 (1987); accord Arlington Cent. Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (States can only be bound to conditions under \nthe Spending Clause where Congress has provided “clear notice regarding the liability at issue.”). \n14 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 15 of 57 PageID #:  15\n64.  Section  601  unambiguously  forbids  only  intentional  discrimination.  Sando-\nval, 532 U.S. at 280. It thus provides no “unambiguous” notice to States that accepting federal funds \nwould bind them to disparate-impact-based requirements. Indeed, by its own terms it unambiguous-\nly does not impose any such requirements. \n65.  And even if, contrary to the reasoning above, Section 602’s bare “effectuate” text \ncould otherwise be read to supply authority to impose disparate-impact-based requirements, it cer-\ntainly does not do so unambiguously. As a result, the States cannot be bound by the Executive’s at-\ntempt to exploit Congress’s Spending Clause power to impose disparate-impact-based requirements \non the States. \n66.  Nor can agencies supply the requisite unambiguous clarity for conditions. The Fifth \nCircuit has explicitly they lack constitutional authority to do so. See Texas Educ. Agency v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 992 F.3d 350, 361-62 (5th Cir. 2021) (“The needed clarity cannot be so provided [by regula-\ntion]—it must come directly from the statute.”); see also Virginia Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, \n567 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (adopting opinion of Luttig, J., dissenting at panel-stage). \n67.  Even aside from its illegality, imposing disparate-impact mandates under Title VI is \nfrequently disastrous policy—even for the racial group that the agency is attempting to assist. See also \nRollerson, 6 F.4th at 650 (Ho, J., concurring) (“Citizens are understandably skeptical when govern-\nment officials claim that they're just here to help—but then declare that up is down, left is right, race \nconsciousness is good, and race neutrality is bad.”) (Title VI case). \n68.  For example, when the Department of Education imposed disparate-impact-based \nrequirements on school discipline, the results were calamitous for all involved. Schools predictably \nreacted by drastically reducing suspensions and vastly increasing the threshold for imposing them. \nFor example, the Oklahoma City School District reduced its number of suspensions by 42.5% and \n15 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 16 of 57 PageID #:  16\nteachers were told suspensions would not be handed down unless there was literal bloodshed.1 Dis-\nparate-impact-based policies similarly produced disaster in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana.2 The end re-\nsult was to exacerbate disruptions in the classroom, which had the perverse effect of disproportion-\nately making it harder for minority students to learn—the group that the Education Department pa-\nternalistically was purporting to assist.3 But the federal government’s action itself perversely inflicted a \ndisparate burden on minority students’ educations.  \n69.  That would be the case here too: in the name of benefiting African Americans in the \nBaton-Rouge-New-Orleans region through reduced air emissions, EPA would in fact be creating \nsubstantial economic disruption and unemployment that would disproportionately fall upon the very \nAfrican Americans that EPA is purporting to help. And such “assistance” would be in spite of the \nfact that EPA does not contest either that (1) the State has not engaged in any intentional racial dis-\ncrimination and (2) the State has otherwise complied with all actual environmental (i.e., non-“equity”-\nbased) standards. \n70.  Those economic benefits are why local officials elected by the residents support the \nfacilities and celebrated when the Denka facility opened a new corporate office:  \n                                                 \n1  See, e.g., Heriot, Gail & Somin, Alison The Department of Education's Obama-Era Initiative on Racial Disparities in School Disci-\npline: Wrong For Students and Teachers, Wrong on the Law (hereinafter, “School Disciple”), 22 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 471, 496-97 \n(Spring 2018) (Teachers “were told that referrals would not require suspension unless there was blood.’” (quoting The \nOklahoman Editorial Board, Survey Shows Disconnect Between OKC School District and Its Teachers, OKLAHOMAN (Nov. 4, \n2015), http://newsok.com/article/5457999[https://perma.cc/75JR-DQEC].) \n2  Id. at 499-50. \n3  Id. at 495-507. \n16 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 17 of 57 PageID #:  17\n \n71.  EPA’s purported solicitude for helping minorities thus does not extend to actually \nlistening to what they or their elected leaders have to say. Instead, EPA paternalistically “knows” \nwhat is best for them and intends to impose it upon them whether they like it or not. \n72.  Third Set of Violations: EPA’s Policy Of Imposing Extra-Regulatory, Unrati-\nfied Requirements. EPA’s actions suffer a final legal infirmity: the agency’s attempt to invent new \nTitle VI mandates on the fly is patently illegal. \n73.  Section 602 provides agencies with authority to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders \nof general applicability [to effectuate Section 601] which shall be consistent with achievement of the \nobjectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is \ntaken.” U.S.C. § 2000d-1. “No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and until \napproved by the President,” however. Id. (emphasis added). \n74.  EPA notably has a set of Title VI regulations, which are codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 7, \nand have received the requisite ratification by the President (through DOJ, which was delegated the \nrelevant authority by the President). See Exec. Order No. 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (1980).  \n17 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 18 of 57 PageID #:  18\n75.  But EPA is not content simply to enforce the requirements actually found in its \nPresidentially-approved regulations. Instead, the agency has made plain its intent to impose new re-\nquirements on the State, which are purely inventions and not found anywhere in EPA’s regulations—\nor even EPA’s own Title VI programs. \n76.  EPA has, for example, has demanded pre-decisional impacts analysis equivalent to \nthe National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) without the slightest authority to require such \nanalysis. In particular, EPA has demanded “cumulative impacts assessment”—a concept not even \nhinted at in EPA’s Title VI regulations. \n77.  EPA has similarly demanded that LDEQ create an entirely new system of conduct-\ning “community meetings” to address a “perceived lack of community involvement,” and to process \ncomplaints in a particular manner, making clear that EPA intends to micro-manage LDEQ and oth-\ner state agencies. EPA is not content merely to ensure that state agencies do not impose unlawful \ndisparate impacts, but also intends to dictate how they avoid such impacts.  \n78.  EPA’s attempt to invent new mandates on the fly is unequivocally unlawful. As an \ninitial matter, EPA cannot engage in rulemaking—such as creating new putative Title VI require-\nments—except through compliance with the APA rulemaking requirements. See generally 5 U.S.C. \n§ 501 et seq. The APA creates important procedural safeguards, such as notice-and-comment rule-\nmaking and publication in the Federal Register. The former allows the public to participate in the \nprocess of creating the relevant requirements while the latter is essential so that regulated parties \nhave notice as to what is actually required of them. \n79.  EPA’s attempted rulemaking-by-whim approach here is fundamentally incompatible \nwith the APA. If EPA wishes to add requirements to its Title VI regulations, it must do so through \nAPA rulemaking, rather than ad hoc inventions.  \n18 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 19 of 57 PageID #:  19\n80.  EPA’s violations are even more clearly unlawful here as they violate not only the \nAPA generally, but Section 602’s explicit requirement that no “rule, regulation, or order” implement-\ning Title VI can “become effective unless and until approved by the President.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 (em-\nphasis added).  \n81.  EPA has never indicated that any of its newly minted mandates have been ratified by \nthe President and the State is not aware of any evidence that they have been. As such, EPA’s ad hoc \ninventions appear to violate the explicit Presidential approval requirement of Section 602. \n82.  EPA’s leveraging Title VI to impose requirements beyond those of Title VI itself for \nunspecified violations also impinges the statutory limitation that a remedy is unavailable “until the \ndepartment or agency concerned as advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to \ncomply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary \nmeans.” Id. (emphasis added). \n83.  The legal violations present here are clear-cut and squarely within this Court’s juris-\ndiction to review now. This Court should vacate and/or enjoin Defendants’ unlawful actions and \nregulations. \n84.  EPA has further made clear that it wanted Louisiana agencies to apply EPA’s “civil \nrights framework” in “to all of your permitting actions” going forward, not just specific sites or \npermits. Put plainly, EPA intends to apply its unlawful policies throughout all judicial districts in the \nState. \nPARTIES \n85.  Plaintiff State of Louisiana is a sovereign State of the United States of America. Lou-\nisiana sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests.  \n19 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 20 of 57 PageID #:  20\n86.  Louisiana brings this suit through its Attorney General, Jeff Landry. He is authorized \nby Louisiana law to sue on the State’s behalf. La. Const. Art. IV, § 8. His offices are located at 1885 \nNorth Third Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802. \n87.  Defendants are officials of the United States government and United States govern-\nmental agencies responsible for promulgating or implementing the challenged actions and regula-\ntions. \n88.  Defendant, EPA is the federal agency charged with the administration of federal en-\nvironmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 et seq.  \n89.  EPA also provides federal monetary assistance and funds to state agencies, such as \nthe LDEQ and the Louisiana Department of Health (“LDH”). Through offices within EPA, includ-\ning the External Civil Rights Compliance Office and/or the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”), EPA \nenforces certain regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that \npurport to prohibit discrimination against members of the public by recipients of EPA funds.  \n90.  Defendant Michael S. Regan the Administrator of EPA. He is sued in his official ca-\npacity. \n91.  Defendant Lilian S. Dorka (“Dorka”) is the Director of EPA’s External Civil Rights \nCompliance Office (formerly EPA’s Office of Civil Rights) and executed the Letter of Concern to \nLDH and LDEQ. Upon information and belief, Dorka is required to “approve any informal resolu-\ntion before it becomes final” and “is authorized to issue final agency decisions on Title VI cases.” \nSee EPA Order 4701. Dorka is sued in her official capacity. \n92.  Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an executive department of the United \nStates Federal Government. \n93.  Defendant Merrick Garland is the Attorney General of the United States of America. \nHe is sued in his official capacity. \n20 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 21 of 57 PageID #:  21\n94.  Defendant Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is the President of the United States. He is sued in \nhis official capacity. \n95.  Defendant the United States of America is sued under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–03 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 1346 and includes the departments and agencies thereof. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n96.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case because it arises under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, 1361; 5 U.S.C. § 701-06. \n97.  An actual controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201(a), and this Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other relief under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201-02, 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-06, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and its inherent equitable powers. \n98.  The State has several causes of action to assert the claims at issue here: those \n(1) “arising] under the Constitution” itself, Cochran v. SEC, 20 F.4th 194 (5th Cir. 2021) (en banc) \ncert. granted 142 S.Ct. 2707 (2022); (2) an equitable cause of action arising from the “power of federal \ncourts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action,” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. \n320, 327 (2015); accord Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010)) \n(collecting cases); (3) a “non-statutory cause of action” to challenge “[w]hen an executive acts ultra \nvires,” Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996); and (4) a cause of action \nunder Section 10 of the APA (5 U.S.C. § 704). \n99.  To the extent that it exists, sovereign immunity has been waived for all of the State’s \nclaims under 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n100.  Section 702 “waive[s] immunity for non-statutory causes of action against federal \nagencies arising under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.” Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas v. United States, 757 F.3d \n484, 488 (5th Cir. 2014). “Section 702 … waives immunity for two distinct types of claims.” Id. 489. \nThe first is for final agency actions under the APA’s cause of action (§ 704). Id. The second is \n21 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 22 of 57 PageID #:  22\n“where a person is ‘adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute.’” Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702). “This type of waiver applies when judicial review is sought \npursuant to a statutory or non-statutory cause of action that arises completely apart from the general provi-\nsions of the APA.” Id. (emphasis added). \n101.  “There is no requirement of ‘finality’ for this [second] type of waiver to apply. The \nrequirement of ‘finality’ comes from § 704 and has been read into § 702 in cases where review is \nsought pursuant only to the general provisions of the APA. Instead, for this type of waiver there \nonly needs to be ‘agency action’ as set forth by 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).” Id. (citations omitted). \n102.  As a result, the State need not establish final agency action for any of the first three \ntypes of cause of action asserted here (i.e., claims arising under the Constitution, under the equitable \npowers of federal courts to enjoin unlawful agency action, and under the non-statutory cause of ac-\ntion to challenge ultra vires agency actions). \n103.  As to the State’s APA claims, Defendants have taken final agency action that is re-\nviewable by this Court. \n104.  No other statute precludes judicial review here. Nor has Congress intended to pre-\nclude judicial review of the claims asserted here.  \n105.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because (1) Defendants \nare United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities, (2) the State of Louisiana is a \nresident of this judicial district, (3) no real property is involved, and (4) a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the Complaint occur within this judicial district. See Atlanta & F.R. \nCo. v. W. Ry. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1982); Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. \nSupp. 3d 482 (D. Md. 2020). \n22 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 23 of 57 PageID #:  23\n106.  The challenged EPA actions and policies would apply to Clean Air Act permit appli-\ncations and renewals that are currently pending for sources in this division, as well as future permit-\nting actions under other environmental statutes in this division.  \n107.  According to LDEQ’s “Check Permit Status” tool, multiple permit applications and \npermit renewals are pending for sources in Calcasieu parish.  \n108.  For example, LDEQ’s “Check Permit Status” tool shows, as of 5/19/2023, Reyn-\nolds Metals Company is seeking an Air Permit Variance that has been pending since 9/30/2015. Ac-\ntivity No. PER20150004. Reynolds is also seeking a Title IV Permit Initial (Activity PER20110001) \nand a Title V Regular Permit Renewal (PER20110002). \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \nTITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 \n109.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, \nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to dis-\ncrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  \n110.  “Only racial discrimination of the same character as that forbidden by the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause is prohibited by [Section] 601.” Rollerson v. Brazos River Harbor Nav. Dist., 6 F. 4th 633, \n639 (5th Cir. 2021) (citing Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003)). “Thus, it ‘prohibits only in-\ntentional discrimination.’” Id. (quoting Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 280). That requires the challenged action \nwas done “at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of’ … adverse effects.” Id. (quoting Pers. \nAdm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)).  \n111.  Title VI, Section 602, authorizes implementing regulations. It provides:  \nEach Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal finan-\ncial assistance to any program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other \nthan a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to effectuate the \n23 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 24 of 57 PageID #:  24\nprovisions of section 2000d of this title with respect to such program or activity by \nissuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent \nwith achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance \nin connection with which the action is taken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall \nbecome effective unless and until approved by the President. Compliance with any \nrequirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination \nof or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any \nrecipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after oppor-\ntunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such termina-\ntion or refusal shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or \nother recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its \neffect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has \nbeen so found, or (2) by any other means authorized by law: Provided, however, That no \nsuch action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the \nappropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has \ndetermined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. In the case of \nany action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, assistance because of failure \nto comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to this section, the head of the Fed-\neral department or agency shall file with the committees of the House and Senate \nhaving legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written re-\nport of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. No such action shall be-\ncome effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report. \n42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. \n112.  Rules and regulations issued under Section 602 require Presidential ratification: “No \nsuch rule, regulation, or order [implementing Title VI] shall become effective unless and until ap-\nproved by the President.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n113.  The President delegated his authority to approve Title VI regulations to the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, and further directed the Attorney General of the United States to “co-\nordinate the implementation and enforcement by Executive agencies” of Title VI. Exec. Order No. \n12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (1980). The Attorney General of the United States, in turn, directed that \n“the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division shall be responsible for coor-\ndinating the implementation and enforcement by Executive agencies of the nondiscrimination pro-\nvisions” of Title VI. 28 C.F.R. § 0.51(a). \n24 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 25 of 57 PageID #:  25\n114.  DOJ has adopted regulations to implement Title VI under Section 602. See 28 C.F.R. \n§§ 41.101-12. Since their adoption in 1966, DOJ’s regulations have purported to impose disparate-\nimpact-based requirements. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2). \n115.  EPA has adopted regulations to implement Title VI. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 7.10-180. Since \nat least 1984, EPA’s regulations have contained language which EPA construes as proscribing dis-\nparate-impact. See 40 C.F.R. § 7.35(b), (c). \n116.  In Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), the Supreme Court called into serious \ndoubt whether regulations promulgated under Section 602 of Title VI may validly proscribe activi-\nties that merely have a disparate impact: \n[H]ow strange it is [for the dissent] to say that disparate-impact regulations are “in-\nspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with” § 601, post, at 1531, \nwhen § 601 permits the very behavior that the regulations forbid. See Guardians, 463 \nU.S., at 613, 103 S.Ct. 3221 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (“If, as five \nMembers  of  the  Court  concluded  in Bakke, the  purpose  of  Title  VI  is  to  pro-\nscribe only purposeful discrimination ..., regulations that would proscribe conduct by \nthe recipient having only a discriminatory effect ... do not simply ‘further’ the purpose \nof Title VI; they go well beyond that purpose”). \n \n532 U.S. at 286 n.6.  \n  \n117.  In 2003, when DOJ, EPA, and numerous other agencies issued a joint rule imple-\nmenting the Civil Rights Restoration Act, the agencies stated they were “mindful of the Supreme \nCourt’s statements in Sandoval that call the validity of the Title VI disparate impact regulations into \nquestion.” 68 Fed. Reg. 51,334, 51,338 (Aug. 26, 2003). The agencies nevertheless proceeded in issu-\ning a final rule because Sandoval “did not … address the focus of [that 2003] rulemaking.” Id.  \n118.  DOJ developed a final rule in 2020 to address “[t]he current regulations’ extension of \nprohibited conduct to unintentional disparate impact” which “expands the prohibition to a vastly \nbroader scope of conduct than the intentionally discriminatory conduct that the statute itself prohib-\nits.” DOJ noted “[t]he Supreme Court’s Sandoval decision has led to a divergence between Title VI \nenforcement by private plaintiffs and federal departments and agencies.” The final rule’s “regulatory \n25 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 26 of 57 PageID #:  26\nchanges address the concerns regarding the statutory authority supporting the scope of [DOJ’s] reg-\nulations that the Supreme Court questioned in Sandoval, harmonize the implementing regulations’ \nscope with the conduct that Congress actually intended Title VI to prohibit, promote consistent en-\nforcement among private plaintiffs and federal departments and agencies, as well as provide much \nneeded clarity to the courts and federal funding recipients and beneficiaries.”  \n119.  To that end, the final rule deleted regulatory language purporting to regulate dispar-\nate impact. Although the Office of Management and Budget completed its review of the final rule \non January 8, 2021, Defendants inexplicably failed to publish it in the Federal Register.  \nEPA’S TITLE VI COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCESS \n120.  EPA’s Title VI regulations establish a complaint process. Any person “who believes \nthat he or she or a specific class of persons has been discriminated against” may file a complaint. 40 \nC.F.R. § 7.120(a).  \n121.  The complaint “must be filed within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory \nacts,” unless EPA waives the “time limit for good cause.” 40 C.F.R. § 7.120(b)(2). EPA must \n“promptly” investigate all such complaints. 40 C.F.R. § 7.120. \n122.  Once a complaint is filed, EPA will “immediately initiate [its] complaint processing \nprocedures” and conduct a “preliminary investigation” to determine if it will accept, reject, or refer \nthe complaint to the appropriate agency. 40 C.F.R. § 7.120(d). If EPA accepts the complaint, EPA \nwill notify the recipient of the allegations and allow the recipient to submit a response to the com-\nplaint. If EPA decides that there is “no violation,” it will dismiss the complaint. 40 C.F.R. § 7.120(g). \n123.  If a complaint is accepted, EPA is required to “attempt to resolve complaints infor-\nmally whenever possible.” 40 C.F.R. § 7.120(d)(2).  \n124.  “When a complaint cannot be resolved informally, OCR shall follow the procedures \nestablished by paragraphs (c) through (e) of § 7.115.” 40 C.F.R. § 7.120(d)(2)(i). Those provisions \n26 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 27 of 57 PageID #:  27\nprovide, inter alia, that “[w]ithin 180 days from the start of the … complaint investigation, the OCR \nwill notify the recipient in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, of: (i) preliminary find-\nings; (ii) recommendations, if any, for achieving voluntary compliance; and (iii) recipient’s right to \nengage in voluntary compliance negotiations where appropriate.” 40 C.F.R. § 7.115(c).  \n125.  If the complaint cannot be resolved informally, EPA must issue a preliminary finding \nof noncompliance, with which the recipient may agree or contest. 40 C.F.R. § 7.115. \n126.  In 2015, EPA proposed to amend its regulations implementing Title VI. 80 Fed. Reg. \n77,284 (Dec. 14, 2015). EPA explained that it had “compar[ed] its Title VI and other nondiscrimina-\ntion regulations to those of over twenty other federal agencies.” Id. at 77,285. “The EPA found that \nthe other agencies’ regulations were the same or extremely similar, while the EPA’s regulations were \ndifferent.” Id. Other agencies’ regulations, for example, “explicitly affirm the agency’s discretion to \nappropriately tailor complaint resolution paths based on the nature and complexity of the allegations \npresented.” Id.  \n127.  EPA repeatedly called the deadlines in its Title VI regulations “arbitrary,” and ex-\nplained that “[b]y eliminating arbitrary deadlines, the EPA will be better positioned to strategically \nmanage its administrative complaint docket.” 80 Fed. Reg. at 77,285 (emphasis added). \n128.  As particularly relevant here,  \nEPA propose[d] to remove the provision to provide postreview notice to a recipient \nwithin 180 calendar days from the start of a compliance review or complaint investi-\ngation pursuant to 40 CFR 7.115(c)(1). Instead of this calendar deadline, the EPA \npropose[d] to conform to the regulations of over twenty other federal agencies that \nstate that complaints will be ‘‘promptly’’ investigated. The EPA proposes to adopt \nthis language because it has found that this self-imposed, inflexible deadline is im-\npracticable given the inherent scientific complexity associated with determining \nwhich and how populations are impacted by environmental pollutants; the number \nof discrimination allegations and theories that may be asserted in any one complaint \nunder Title VI or the other nondiscrimination statutes; and the volume of the com-\nplaints received. Without the burden of an unrealistic, self-imposed deadline, the \nEPA will be in a better position to improve the entire External Compliance and \nComplaints Program…. \n \n27 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 28 of 57 PageID #:  28\n80 Fed. Reg. at 77,287 (emphasis added). \n \n129.  Despite conceding that the 180-day deadline in 40 C.F.R. § 7.115(c)(1) is “arbitrary,” \n“impracticable,” and “unrealistic,” EPA failed to finalize its proposed rule. But the agency has never \nwithdrawn or disavowed its conclusion that the deadline is “impracticable” and “unrealistic.” \nTHE CLEAN AIR ACT \n130.  The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) is intended “to protect and enhance the quality of the \nNation’s air resources.” 42 U.S.C. § 7401(b)(1). That commitment is not myopic, however, and regu-\nlators are required to take into account the achievability of emissions reductions and the cost of reg-\nulations. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 7412(d)(2) (requiring the EPA Administrator to “tak[e] into considera-\ntion the cost of achieving such emission reduction”); Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 751-60 (2015).  \n131.  States play a key role in implementing the Clean Air Act. Indeed, Congress made an \nexpress finding that “the prevention and control of air pollution at its source is the primary respon-\nsibility of States and local governments.” Pub. L. 88-206, 77 Stat. 392 (1963) (codified at 42 USC \n7401(a)(3)).  \n132.  Consistent with that finding, when Congress enacted a source-specific permitting \nscheme as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, it gave \nStates the principal role in air-emission permitting. See 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(d). \n133.  But States’ acceptance of that role was secured through coercion: failure to develop \nand submit to the EPA Administrator a permit program meeting the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct could result in the application of sanctions, including a broad loss of federal highway funding. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 7661a(d) (authorizing application of the sanctions specified in 42 U.S.C. § 7509(b)).  \n134.  In contrast to the States, Congress relegated EPA to a largely supervisory role. To \nthat end, State permitting authorities are required to “transmit to the [EPA] Administrator a copy of \neach permit application … or such portion thereof, including any compliance plan, as the Adminis-\n28 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 29 of 57 PageID #:  29\ntrator may require to effectively review the application and otherwise to carry out the Administra-\ntor’s responsibilities under [the Clean Air Act],” together with “a copy of each permit proposed to \nbe issued and issued as a final permit.” 42 U.S.C. § 7661d(a)(1). “If any permit contains provisions \nthat are determined by the [EPA] Administrator as not in compliance with the applicable require-\nments of [the Clean Air Act], … the [EPA] Administrator shall … object to its issuance.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7661d(b)(1). An objection will either prevent the issuance of the permit or cause the permit to be \nmodified, terminated, or revoked. See 42 U.S.C. § 7661d(b).  \n135.  Put simply, the Clean Air Act is “‘an experiment in cooperative federalism’ that di-\nvides responsibilities between EPA and the states.” Environmental Integrity Project v. EPA, 969 F.3d \n529, 535 (5th Cir. 2020) (quoting Luminant Generation Co. v. EPA, 675 F.3d 917, 921 (5th Cir. 2012)). \nEPA overstepping its bounds under this cooperative federalism scheme is both unlawful and subject \nto judicial review and correction. Luminant, 675 F.3d at 932-33. \n136.  In Louisiana, LDEQ’s Air Permits Division has responsibility for Clean Air Act \npermitting under the cooperative federalism system established by the CAA. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nEPA FUNDING GRANTS TO LOUISIANA AGENCIES \n137.  EPA has provided many monetary grants to numerous Louisiana agencies over the \npast six years, including the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”), and the \nLouisiana Department of Health (“LDH”), thus extending the mandates of Title VI to Louisiana \nagencies for the duration of their respective grants. The sums are substantial. For example, accord-\ning to usaspending.gov, since FY2008, EPA awarded grants to LDEQ totaling over $32,800,000, \nand awarded grants to LDH totaling over $287,000,000. \n138.  By  way  of  illustration,  EPA  obligated  $17,470,000  for  the  period  July  1,  2020, \nthrough June 30, 2022, to capitalize LDEQ’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund (FAIN 22000220); \n29 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 30 of 57 PageID #:  30\nEPA obligated $17,467,000, for the period July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2023, to capitalize LDEQ’s \nClean Water State Revolving Fund (FAIN 22000221); and EPA obligated $12,720,000, for the peri-\nod August 1, 2022, through June 30, 2024, to capitalize LDEQ’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund \n(FAIN 22000222).  \n139.  Similar examples exist for LDH. EPA obligated $26,930,000 for the period October \n1, 2022, through September 30, 2026, to LDH to capitalize Louisiana’s Drinking Water State Re-\nvolving Fund (FAIN 02F22701); EPA obligated $16,465,000 for the period July 1, 2021, through \nJune 30, 2025, to LDH to capitalize Louisiana’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (FAIN \n99696824); EPA obligated $16,480,000, for the period July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2024, to LDH \nto capitalize Louisiana’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (FAIN 99696823); EPA obligated \n$16,625,000, for the period July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2024, to LDH to capitalize Louisiana’s \nDrinking Water State Revolving Fund (FAIN 99696822); and EPA obligated $16,626,000 for the \nperiod July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2022, to LDH to capitalize Louisiana’s Drinking Water State \nRevolving Fund (FAIN 99696821). \n140.   Upon information and belief, Louisiana agencies have undisbursed grant funding, \nand the agencies will seek additional grant funding from EPA in the future.  \n141.  Upon information and belief, EPA has at all relevant times purported to condition \nthose grants on the recipient “comply[ing] with … Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964” and \n“comply[ing] with all applicable EPA civil rights regulations, including … For Title VI … 40 CFR \nPart 7.” EPA further purports to condition those grants on “the recipient acknowledge[ing] it has an \naffirmative obligation to implement effective Title VI compliance programs and ensure that its ac-\ntions do not involve discriminatory treatment and do not have discriminatory effects even when fa-\n30 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 31 of 57 PageID #:  31\ncially neutral.”4 \nGRANT OF CLEAN AIR ACT PERMITS FOR THE DENKA AND FORMOSA FACILITIES \n142.  On January 6, 2020, LDEQ issued CAA permits for the Denka and Formosa facili-\nties, allowing them to continue operations. It issued a “Basis for Decision” (“BFD”) on the same \nday. \n143.  Upon information and belief, EPA was aware that LDEQ was considering issuing \nthe permits at issue, had an opportunity to provide input on those decisions, and did not object to \nissuance of any of the permits, although it was empowered to do so if the agency had concerns. See \n42 U.S.C. § 7661d(b). \n144.  EPA does not contend that issuance of those permits violates the Clean Air Act. De-\nfendant Dorka has specifically acknowledged that LDEQ was “following the environmental law” in \ngranting the permits. Instead, EPA’s stated concerns have related solely to Title VI. \n145.  EPA has been perfectly clear that it does not view compliance with the CAA as suf-\nficient to justify the permits for the Denka and Formosa Facilities, with one official saying: “Some-\ntimes … in order to address what appears to be a disparate impact, disparate harm, you may need to \ngo beyond [environmental statutory] authorities.” \nEPA “JOURNEY TO JUSTICE TOUR” \n146.  According to Administrator Regan, “[f]rom [his] first day at EPA, [he] ha[s] commit-\nted to embedding equity, environmental justice, and civil rights into the DNA of the Agency’s pro-\ngrams, policies, and processes, and to delivering tangible results to underserved communities.” \n147.  In November 2021, Administrator Regan embarked on what EPA called the “Jour-\nney to Justice Tour.” During his tour, he visited multiple Louisiana parishes and met with various \nenvironmental activists and groups. \n                                                 \n4  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-\n09/fy_2022_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2022_or_later.pdf \n31 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 32 of 57 PageID #:  32\n148.  Upon information and belief, Administrator Regan did not meet with any groups \nrepresenting industry. \n149.  During his tour, Administrator Regan met with groups that have advocated initiation \nof Title VI disparate impact enforcement actions relating to the Denka and Formosa Facilities. For \nexample, Mr. Regan’s meeting with the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orle-\nans was “marked by calls for the federal agency to … launch a civil rights investigation into ‘Cancer \nAlley.’”  \n150.  During the tour, Administrator Regan stated that EPA needed to “leverage our en-\nforcement.” He further stated that, with respect to the Denka Facility, “we have enforcement au-\nthority that we’re taking a very close look at to bring the facility into compliance.” \n151.  Administrator Regan’s politically oriented tour was particularly surprising given that \nEPA had rebuffed Louisiana’s request for assistance with, e.g., emissions monitoring in that same \narea. \n152.  An investigative journalist subsequently published an article that provided additional \ninsight. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade – founded and directed by a white woman, based in New Or-\nleans, and who had previously been charged with felony terrorizing of an industry executive — had \nurged EPA to advance a Title VI claim against industrial facilities that had long been a target of ac-\ntivist ire. \nSPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS FILE COMPLAINTS  \n153.  Shortly following the Journey for Justice Tour, complaints alleging disparate impact \nwere filed against LDEQ and LDH with EPA pursuant to Part 7. The complainants included enti-\nties and groups that met with Administrator Regan during his Journey to Justice tour. \n154.  On January 20, 2022, the Concerned Citizens of St. John (“CCSJ”) and the Sierra \nClub filed Complaint Nos. 01R-22-R6 (LDEQ and the Denka Facility) (“Complaint #1”) and 02R-22-\n32 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 33 of 57 PageID #:  33\nR6 (LDEQ and the Denka Facility) (“Complaint #2”) against the LDEQ and LDH “for violations of \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., and the U.S. Environmental Pro-\ntection Agency’s (“EPA”) implementing regulations, 40 C.F.R. Part 7.”5 These two complaints pri-\nmarily related to the Denka Facility and the agency actions regarding or relating to the Denka Facili-\nty.  \n155.  On February 1, 2022, Tulane Environmental Law Clinic on behalf of Stop the Wal-\nlace Grain Terminal, Inclusive Louisiana, RISE St. James, and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a \ncomplaint No. 04R-22-R6 (LDEQ and the Industrial Corridor and the Formosa Facility) (“Complaint #3”) \nagainst the LDEQ “under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and the \nEPA’s implementing regulations, 40 C.F.R. Part 7.”6 This complaint related to the LDEQ’s actions \nregarding and related to permitting of the FG LA LLC facility in St. James Parish (the “Formosa \nFacility”) and other actions within the Industrial Corridor.  \n156.  All three complaints were untimely. EPA regulations require that complaints “must \nbe filed within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory acts,” unless EPA waives the “time \nlimit for good cause.” 40 C.F.R. §7.120(b)(2). EPA must “promptly” investigate all such complaints. \n40 C.F.R. §7.120. \n157.  EPA has not identified any such “good cause.” Nor does such “good cause” exist. \n158.  On April 6, 2022, EPA accepted all three complaints.  \n159.  LDEQ and LDH were notified of the Three Complaints and offered an opportunity \nto participate in informal resolution discussions to which they both agreed.  \n160.  Without warning to the LDEQ or LDH, the EPA then substantially departed from \nits normal procedure by issuing a Letter of Concern and releasing it to the general public on Octo-\n                                                 \n5 https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-09/01R-22-R6%20Complaint_Redacted.pdf  \n6 https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-06/04R-22-R6%20Complaint%20Redacted.pdf  \n33 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 34 of 57 PageID #:  34\nber 12, 2022. In its Letter of Concern, EPA claimed that “Title VI prohibits … acts that have an \nunjustified disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin.” \n161.  EPA’s investigation underlying that letter was a perfunctory pretext that, upon in-\nformation and belief, consisted of extensive communications with the complainants, review of an \n“environmental justice” law review article and an article in The Atlantic magazine, but little else be-\nyond a cursory review of LDEQ’s and LDH’s websites. The articles EPA reviewed and block quot-\ned in its Letter of Concern provided a ready, non-discriminatory explanation for the siting of the \nindustrial facilities EPA was attacking: “a pattern of large, contiguous blocks of open land under sin-\ngle ownership” combined with “easy access to some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.” EPA \nsimply ignored that geographic explanation. Worse, upon information and belief, at least LDEQ \nsought to participate in the investigation, but was told by EPA to wait for the Letter of Concern to \nbe issued. EPA then, without apparent shame, faulted LDEQ for not participating in its pre-letter \ninvestigation—even though LDEQ had done so at EPA’s specific suggestion.  \n162.  To be clear, this action does not directly challenge EPA’s issuance of the Letter of \nConcern. Instead, the Letter of Concern support the State’s challenges to other actions by EPA that \nare reviewable by this Court. The Letter of Concern further provides strong evidence that the State \nfaces a realistic threat of enforcement of Title VI by Defendants based on theories that the State’s \nactions cause disparate impacts and that the State is contravening extra-regulatory requirements that \nEPA has invented.  \nINFORMAL RESOLUTION NEGOTIATIONS \n163.  Informal resolution discussions began via a telephone conference on November 16, \n2022. LADOJ inquired as to “exactly” what EPA believes LDEQ and LDH are doing wrong, and \nexplained that EPA’s letters of concern do not identify specific actions. LADOJ accordingly asked \n34 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 35 of 57 PageID #:  35\nthat EPA specifically identify any provisions in Louisiana law, any actions, or any inactions that EPA \nbelieved were in conflict with Title VI, and that EPA provide supporting legal analysis.  \n164.  EPA refused to do so. Instead, the agency merely reiterated the elements of a dispar-\nate impact claim, then stated “this is not an environmental engagement per se.” Underscoring the \nfundamental disconnect between the agency’s environmental mission and its Title VI regulations, \nEPA officials expressly stated that “compliance with environmental laws is not a shield to Title VI.”  \n165.  Throughout the informal resolution discussions, EPA consistently refused to identify \nthe specific actions or inactions that purportedly underlay its Title VI concerns. For example, in a \nDecember 12, 2022, telephone conference, an EPA representative said EPA was “not looking at \nactual permit issuance and what happened each time a permit was issued.”  \n166.  Defendant Dorka then elaborated that no specific action is at issue, and EPA is tar-\ngeting the cumulative impact of LDEQ’s actions. But Dorka then contradicted herself only three \nweeks later, in a January 4, 2023, telephone conference: When LADOJ noted EPA “still had not \nidentified any specific thing … you think creates a civil rights problem, other than outcome,” Dorka \nresponded “this is not about procedures,” claimed “it’s your method of administering your air pro-\ngram in a couple of different instances … we find strong evidence that the method of administering \nthe air program … resulted in some harms, some impacts, and that those impacts were born dispro-\nportionately on the basis of race.”  \n167.  LADOJ again asked EPA to identify the specifics: “[W]hat are the criteria or meth-\nods of administration EPA believes are creating a disparate impact, specifically?” Starting a long-\nrunning pattern of dismissive responses, Dorka stated “that’s not going to move forward our con-\nversation today,” then again generically pointed to LDEQ’s “administration of the air program.” \nWhen pressed, EPA pointed to LDEQ’s issuance of a single permit, and said “that subjected people \n35 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 36 of 57 PageID #:  36\nto discrimination.” EPA then refused to state whether its Letter of Concern represented a complete \nstatement of EPA’s concerns.  \n168.  LADOJ noted “the remedy [EPA is] entitled to is one-for-one with [any] non-\ncompliance.” Dorka continued to dismiss LADOJ’s concerns, stating that discussions of “remedy” \nwould only come with formal findings. LADOJ again explained: “The statutory requirement is for \ncompliance, [and] that’s all EPA is entitled to;” “EPA is statutorily obligated to provide us with no-\ntice of how [LDEQ] purportedly failed to comply” with Title VI; “[w]e need to know specifically \nwhere EPA thinks there’s non-compliance” in order to meaningfully negotiate; but EPA is only \npointing to undefined “methods of administration.”  \n169.  At that point, LADOJ explained that EPA was not making the process productive: \n“[W]e are asking you to identify the very specific things” where EPA believes there is any non-\ncompliance” with Title VI. LADOJ continued: “We keep having these calls where EPA … throw[s] \nout pretty important, significant accusations,” but EPA is not wanting to memorialize those accusa-\ntions and is “not wanting to actually engage with us on what the legal requirements are and what the \nlegal defects are.”  \n170.  EPA kept intoning “disparate impact” as if those words were a magic talisman that \nentitled the agency to impose upon LDH and LDEQ any requirement that EPA cares to invent. But \nEPA failed to apply even the basic requirements of its chosen theory of disparate impact: Dorka \nstated that EPA is not looking at a comparison with a similarly situated action or population, merely \nwhether alleged harms fall on communities that are predominately black.  \n171.  Dorka finally admitted “you’re not going to see in any letter where we think [LDEQ \nor LDH] violated the law,” but “part of what we’re saying here, is in the future, put a process in \nplace, as we’ve been engaging with many, many states … other states … so that you yourself can do \nan analysis … both from an [environmental justice] perspective [and] from a civil rights perspective, \n36 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 37 of 57 PageID #:  37\nthat gives you an idea of whether the actions you may be about to take could have a disparate impact \non the basis of race.” Entirely absent from that discussion was the source of authority for EPA’s \ndemand. \n172.  On January 18, 2023, Dorka stated that the initial draft informal resolution agree-\nments (“IRAs”) that EPA presented included a lot of “standard boilerplate procedural safeguards \ncommitments that [EPA] share[s] with all recipients,” she expected the agencies “to get back to \n[EPA] as to whether you already have certain things in place,” together with any amendments to \nthose sections, “so that we don’t spend our time on procedurals because we could talk for days on \nthose things.” An LADOJ attorney noted he was “flabbergasted that we’re being presented … with \na boilerplate and asked to redline things that have no apparent application to the complaint,” some \nof which “are far beyond what the statute or regulations contemplate.” He elaborated that “EPA has \na nondiscretionary duty to attempt to resolve this through … voluntarily compliance, and starting \nout like this … is an utter failure to comply with that duty.” \n173.  In that same January 18, 2023, telephone conference, Dorka continued her demand \nthat the agencies agree to things nowhere required by Title VI or any implementing regulation. She \nmade clear, for example, that EPA expected NEPA-like pre-decisional analysis of the potential for \ndisparate impact, including express consideration of race: “Did you consciously think wow, you \nknow, this permit exists in a community of color; they already face x, y, z, challenge … not to men-\ntion there’s limited English proficiency; the population is aging; and all of those different factors. \nDid you even consider those before making decisions? This is to put a framework in place for the \nfuture … for permits for other actions you might be considering.”  \n174.  In a subsequent telephone conference, LADOJ asked for the statutory or regulatory \nbasis for requiring a NEPA-like pre-decisional process. Dorka responded that “what we’re putting in \nplace is totally based on a Title VI approach” and volunteered that “in informally resolving a num-\n37 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 38 of 57 PageID #:  38\nber of these types of cases, we are helping folks put into place a framework, a Title VI disparate im-\npact, identify and address-type of framework” “to address this prospectively.” But Dorka was unable \nto point to any specific provision of Title VI or EPA’s implementing regulations that required such \nan analysis, instead pointed to the general language in EPA regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 7.35, then \nacknowledged “[n]othing’s gonna say that it requires [an analysis] to be conducted before” a permit-\nting action. \n175.  In that same January 18, 2023, telephone conference, Dorka also made clear that \nEPA expected LDEQ to add permitting conditions  not  authorized  by  environmental  statutes: \n“Sometimes … in order to address what appears to be a disparate impact, disparate harm, you may \nneed to go beyond [environmental statutory] authorities. For example, if a facility … has really ad-\nverse effects with respect to odor. Technically the [environmental statutory] authorities may not \nneed you to discuss odor within the construct of that permit. You may need to anyway. You may \nneed to have an odor management plan.” “Odor, traffic, safety, things like that that are nevertheless \nfrom a civil rights perspective adversities that could be caused by certain actions.” In subsequent \nconferences, LDEQ explained that some of those items were not under LDEQ’s purview, pointing \nto impacts from traffic as an example of something that could not be the basis for LDEQ lawfully \ndenying an air permit. EPA made clear, however, that it wanted LDEQ to “consider [things] beyond \nthe four corners of the Clean Air Act” in its permitting decisions. “[I]t goes beyond just air emis-\nsions … all of the other factors that you see make up recommended disparate impact assessment, \nnot just the individual permit.”  \n176.  LDEQ repeatedly explained that it does not have authority to address social inequi-\nties like limited education, limited access to healthcare, age of the housing, or traffic in the context \nof an air permit review. LDEQ pointed to the Clean Air Act’s statutory standard. Dorka responded \nby giving away the game: she complained that “in essence, [LDEQ is] treating … that [minority] \n38 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 39 of 57 PageID #:  39\ncommunity the same as you would any other community….”—i.e., EPA’s true objection is that the \nState is not discriminating on the basis of race. Dorka then acknowledged that LDEQ is “following \nthe environmental law,” but complained “what about the civil rights, what about the other impacts \n… that folks are already suffering?”  \n177.  Dorka then tried to flip the basics of agency law on its head, claiming “you may not \nhave the authority to do it under your own environmental law, although I … don’t see where it pro-\nhibits … you from going beyond the permit.” Dorka continued: “You just consider what else you \nneed to do, in addition to the parameters of the permit.”  \n178.  When LDEQ asked how EPA’s Region 6—which covers Louisiana—is implement-\ning this so-called civil rights framework in areas where it directly issues permits, Dorka blithely dis-\nmissed the question: “[F]ortunately for them, they don’t have a Title VI complaint filed against \nthem,” and pointed to “FAQs” that EPA released the prior summer. LDEQ clarified it was “asking \nfor examples of real-world applications, not FAQs, not guidance documents… how are these prin-\nciples being applied by EPA in permitting?” Dorka acknowledged it was “a reasonable request,” but \ndodged the question, again with a dismissive remark: She was “talking about [LDEQ’s] compliance \nwith [Title VI],” and she was not going to discuss EPA’s permitting process. Dorka never denied \nthat Region 6’s permitting standards would violate the standards Defendants are attempting to foist \nupon LDEQ here. \n179.  In short, EPA not only demanded ex-ante NEPA-like analysis to unlawfully facilitate \ndecision-making on the express basis of race, EPA demanded that LDEQ conduct “cumulative im-\npact assessments” as part of LDEQ’s permitting process, notwithstanding the absence of statutory \nauthority for requiring such assessments. Indeed, as Dorka envisioned it, cumulative impact analyses \ndon’t “necessarily have to be in response to a specific permit review. It … could be more affirma-\ntively done.”  \n39 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 40 of 57 PageID #:  40\n180.  At one point, EPA asserted that even if LDEQ obtained an 85% reduction in emis-\nsions in the course of renewing a permit—i.e., a significant environmental benefit—EPA believed \nthat renewing that permit could result in a disparate impact that would violate Title VI. Dorka con-\nfirmed her subordinate’s point: EPA “would want to capture … any permit” with its civil rights \nframework.  \n181.  Illustrating the vast scope of micro-management EPA believes its generic Title VI \nregulations authorize, EPA stated that LDH and LDEQ should have “community meetings” to ad-\ndress a “perceived lack of community involvement,” and that the State’s speakers at those meetings \nbe  subject  to  various  “protocols.”  When  LADOJ  asked  EPA  to  identify  problems  with,  e.g., \nLDEQ’s current processes for public participation, EPA pointed to a single, off-the-cuff remark by \nthe Secretary of LDEQ at a public meeting. LADOJ noted that “pragmatically, this reflects an utter \nfailure [by EPA to consider] human factors and reality … by parsing what someone said word-by-\nword at a public hearing.” “[I]f that’s the level of perfection you’re expecting … [LADOJ’s] advice \n[to State agencies] would be … [t]o read from bullet points and nothing else.”  \n182.  EPA agreed with that implication. For its part, LDEQ noted the specific example \nEPA identified was about “a risk number … that is an EPA-formulated risk number that is a matter \nof some dispute” and, indeed, is the subject of litigation. Dorka responded that EPA “received these \ncomplaints, and we investigated … preliminarily, and [EPA] came to the conclusion that certain \nthings needed to be put in place in order to informally address the issues that were raised in the \ncomplaints. This is one of them. I mean, we’re not going to argue about whether this is something \nthat we feel needs to address the issues of the complaint …. It was an issue that was raised. We need \nsomething in place to address all of the issues that were raised …. That’s what this agreement is \nabout.”  \n40 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 41 of 57 PageID #:  41\n183.  In short, EPA believes the informal resolution process gives it free reign to make \ndemands of State agencies—including public adherence to EPA’s talking points on disputed scien-\ntific issues—regardless of whether those demands are tied to what Title VI itself demands or “effec-\ntuat[ing] the provisions of” Title VI. 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1. \n184.  EPA implicitly acknowledged as much. EPA repeatedly distinguished between com-\npliance with Title VI and compliance with any involuntary resolution agreement. Indeed, notwith-\nstanding the vast breadth of EPA’s demands, EPA made clear that it does not view compliance with \nany involuntary resolution agreement as a safe harbor against violation of Title VI.  \n185.  In a February 23, 2023, telephone conference, EPA explained that—after three \nmonths of negotiations—it had just then shared all provisions of the proposed IRA for LDEQ; it \nhad not yet shared all provisions for LDH; further negotiation was required; and parts of informal \nresolution agreements EPA was proposing went beyond EPA’s Title VI concerns. LADOJ noted \nsurprise that “EPA is demanding that an agency solicit the opinion of counsel on a very complicated \nagreement, and get a response in two business days,” but “it turns out EPA hasn’t even submitted \nfor consideration everything it wants. If this [proposed agreement] is so straight forward, and clear, \nand so what the law demands,” it “was absolutely flabbergast[ing] that a complete [proposed] \nagreement hasn’t been shared.” LADOJ then re-emphasized that “the informal resolution process is \nprovided in regulation, it’s not an optional thing.”  \n186.  Despite EPA’s regulations mandating that the agency resolve Title VI disputes “in-\nformally whenever possible,” 40 C.F.R. § 7.120 (emphasis added), Dorka responded by claiming EPA had \n“total discretion” regarding informal resolution: “We don’t have to enter into informal resolution. \nOk? We do not.” Dorka continued: “Quite frankly, we also have the discretion not to offer informal \nresolution. That is the agency’s prerogative.” “We don’t have the discretion, though, not to tell you \nwhat we think you’re doing wrong. We have to tell you what we think you’re doing wrong, and that \n41 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 42 of 57 PageID #:  42\ncomes by way of preliminary findings, and then formal findings, etc.” “I disagree that we have no \ndiscretion in terms of informal resolution. We have total discretion.”  \n187.  This exchange is both illustrative and revealing: despite EPA’s operative regulations \nmandating informal resolution “whenever possible,” Defendants believe that they have “total discre-\ntion” to ignore that explicit legal requirement. Indeed, Dorka repeated that “total discretion” prem-\nise a second time, thereby dispelling any doubts as to the chasm between EPA’s actual regulatory \nauthority and Defendants’ view of their authority here. \n188.  That departure from law was not isolated. Consistent with the Clean Air Act, LDEQ \nexplained it is mandated to consider the balance between social and economic benefits of a project \nor an application it is considering, on the one hand, and the potential harm from environmental im-\npact, on the other. Yet when LADOJ pressed EPA on its assuming “traffic” is a per se adverse im-\npact—noting that many small communities consider traffic an economic benefit—Dorka responded \nwith a dismissive “oh, come on,\" then stated she was not considering the economic impact, only \n“the health impact … because after all, our joint mission — [LDEQ] and EPA — is protection of \nhealth and the environment.” \n189.  Throughout the negotiations, EPA acted in close concert with the activist complain-\nants. For example, in a February 9, 2023, EPA stated that it had “making a lot of progress,” but the \nactivists raised an objection to the presence of certain attorneys representing the State because those \nattorneys also represented industry. EPA refused to identify the purported “members of the com-\nmunity” with whom they were coordinating, only that those “members of the community” were \nrepresented by the Tulane Law Clinic.  \n190.  On March 9, 2023, EPA disclosed how far that concerted activity went. Dorka dis-\nclosed that “there are some terms to the agreement that the complainant group wanted,” the com-\nplainants “wanted to be able feel like they are being allowed an opportunity to weigh in on the draft \n42 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 43 of 57 PageID #:  43\nIRA,” Dorka agreed with that, and EPA therefore agreed to “share … the full clean draft that [EPA] \nsent over to LDEQ and the full clean draft that [EPA] sent over LDH.” EPA’s “interest is to get \ncomments back from them,” which EPA had already received from lawyers representing the com-\nplainants. EPA “would consider those,” and “to the extent that … EPA thinks appropriate, [EPA] \nwill include them as we make our changes to the original” proposed resolution agreement. Dorka \nconcluded: “That is what [EPA] committed to doing, [and] that is what we’re going to do.”  \n191.  LDEQ objected to that depth of involvement by complainants and complainants as \nunfair and not previously disclosed. Dorka responded that “under this Administration, we’ve made a \npledge to be more transparent and to be more inclusive in terms of bringing stakeholders to the ta-\nble.” Dorka implied the sharing was a quid pro quo for complainants agreeing to consent to negotia-\ntion: EPA “did not think it was a very high price … in order to get a 120-day extension for the pur-\npose of continuing what we think is a very productive discussion [and] negotiation.” Indeed, EPA \nhad “walked complainants through [EPA’s] draft[s]” and “talked through with them what [EPA] had \nincluded.” \n192.  LADOJ noted that EPA’s actions gave the appearance of “EPA acting as the com-\nplainants’ lawyers rather than a party to the negotiation[.]” LADOJ then asked “since it’s [supposed-\nly] a reasonable condition [to share EPA’s communications with the State as quid pro quo for the \n120-day extension], can we receive a copy of [EPA’s] communications with the complainants?” \nDorka refused.  \n193.  On March 2, 2023, EPA announced yet another departure from its regulations. As \nshe had previously, Dorka acknowledged that EPA, LDEQ, and LDH had “really productive con-\nversations” and had “made a lot of progress.” But Dorka then stated she “cannot imagine how we \nwould be able to finalize something by the [March 13] deadline” under EPA’s then-current agree-\nment with complainants. Dorka accordingly had “asked our [EPA] group to continue … their dili-\n43 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 44 of 57 PageID #:  44\ngence on the IRA, but also to prepare, just in case, we needed to issue preliminary findings. So we \nhave been proceeding on both tracks.” Dorka accordingly said would ask complainants for another \nextension of time during a meeting with complainants the following day. Dorka made clear that if \nshe asked for an additional 90 days, complainants would probably push back.  \n194.  Dorka explained that for other cases—not involving these particular complainants—\nEPA’s policy is to toll the 180-day timeframe. EPA could not do so in this case due to a judgment \nfrom the Northern District of California that applied to the complainants in one of the complaints \nunderlying EPA’s Letter of Concern. EPA had used that judgment throughout the discussions, \npointing to “tight deadlines and constraints” to push back on, e.g., LDH taking time to review drafts \nwith counsel. \n195.  LADOJ repeatedly explained to EPA that Louisiana law restricts State agencies from \nexpending public funds without getting anything in return unless required to do so by law, and that \nState law further restricted an official’s ability to commit to restrictions on the exercise of agency \ndiscretion. EPA nevertheless proceeded to offer its own interpretations of state law and suggest \nLADOJ and LDEQ were wrong about the scope of the agencies’ authority under Louisiana law. \n196.  On April 26, 2023, Dorka wrote to the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of \nEnvironmental Quality, stating that “[w]hile EPA appreciates LDEQ’s engagement in the IRA pro-\ncess and is encouraged by the negotiations to date, we have not yet reached an IRA. Therefore, as \nEPA has previously conveyed to LDEQ, EPA must continue its fact-finding on a parallel track with \nthe IRA process to ensure that EPA … is in a position to resolve the complaint through the issu-\nance of Preliminary Findings, should EPA and LDEQ not be able to reach an IRA by the agreed \nupon date.”  \n197.  EPA attached an extraordinarily burdensome discovery requests to its letter, pur-\nportedly pursuant to its authority under 40 C.F.R. 7.115 and 7.120, attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n44 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 45 of 57 PageID #:  45\nHARMS TO THE STATE \n198.  By subjecting the State to a concededly arbitrary deadline and governmental process-\nes in which the federal Executive illegally delegated governmental powers to non-governmental enti-\nties, Defendants have violated the Constitution and the APA, and they have inflicted irreparable in-\njury upon the State. \n199.  Similarly, by attempting to impose illegal disparate-impact-based and extra-regulatory \nrequirements upon the State, Defendants have inflicted sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \ninjuries upon the State. \n200.  These illegal requirements constrain the State’s authority to regulate and otherwise \nexercise its sovereignty within its own borders, thereby inflicting irreparable harm upon the State.  \n201.  In addition, the State has a sovereign right to unambiguous clarity in any conditions \nthat the federal government intends to impose upon it based on Congress’s Spending Clause pow-\ners. Violation of that right establishes injury and Article III standing. Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, \n852 (9th Cir. 2022) (“States have standing when an allegedly unconstitutional funding offer is made \nto them, and they do not need to first violate a condition of an allegedly unconstitutional contract to \nhave standing to challenge it.”). \n202.  Similarly, Defendants’ illegal requirements are not costless to comply with, and the \nresulting compliance costs inflict cognizable injury. And because the State cannot recover damages \nfrom the federal government, those irrecoverable injuries constitute irreparable harm. See East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 677 (9th Cir. 2021); Kansas Health Care Ass’n, Inc. v. Kansas \nDep’t of Soc. & Rehab. Servs., 31 F.3d 1536, 1543 (10th Cir. 1994); Temple Univ. v. White, 941 F.2d 201, \n214–15 (3d Cir. 1991). \n45 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 46 of 57 PageID #:  46\n203.  In addition, because the State is the “object of the [governmental] action at issue,” its \nstanding to challenge those actions is “self-evident.” Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-62 (1992)). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of The Constitution Under The Private Non-Delegation Doctrine \nAsserted Under The Constitution, Federal Courts’ Equitable Powers, And Non-Statutory \nCause Of Action \n204.  The State repeats and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n205.  The U.S. Constitution, under the private non-delegation doctrine, forbids delegation \nof governmental power to non-governmental actors. Schechter Poultry, 295 U.S. at 537; National \nHorsemen’s, 53 F.4th at 880. \n206.  By delegating to Private Special Interest Groups the power to veto EPA’s continua-\ntion of informal negotiations to secure voluntary compliance past 180 days, EPA has delegated gov-\nernmental power to the groups in a manner that violates the Constitution. In particular, while the \nConstitution demands that the groups may only “function subordinately to the supervising agency,” \nEPA has delegated power such that the agency functions subordinate to the Private Special Interest \nGroups: EPA can only proceed with the course of action it judges appropriate with their consent. \nNational Horsemen’s, 53 F.4th at 881. This “delegation of power is unconstitutional.” Id. at 881. \n207.  The State’s challenge to this unconstitutional delegation of power “arises under the \nConstitution.” Cochran, 20 F.4th at 199. \n208.  Alternatively, federal courts have authority to hear this challenge under the “power \nof federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327; accord Free \nEnterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010) (collecting cas-\n46 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 47 of 57 PageID #:  47\nes). The State therefore may invoke “the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue injunctions to protect \nrights safeguarded by the Constitution.” Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684 (1946). \n209.  The State also has authority to assert this claim under the “non-statutory cause of ac-\ntion,” to challenge ultra vires actions of the Executive. Reich, 74 F.3d at 1328. \n210.  The injury inflicted by the unlawful delegation is both an accomplished fact and on-\ngoing. That injury gives rise to a ripe dispute here, particularly as the non-delegation issue is “purely \nlegal.” See, e.g., Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 581 (1985) (A case is typically \nripe where the “issue presented … is purely legal, and will not be clarified by further factual devel-\nopment.”). \nCOUNT II \nEPA’s Delegation Is Contrary To Law And Arbitrary and Capricious \nAsserted Under The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706 \n211.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n212.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious … or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n213.  As set forth above, EPA’s delegation of veto power to the Private Special Interest \nGroups violates the Constitution. As such it is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n214.  EPA’s delegation is also arbitrary and capricious—by the agency’s own admission. \nEPA has previously conceded that resolving Title VI complaints in 180 days is “unrealistic,” “inflex-\nible,” and “impracticable given the inherent scientific complexity associated with determining which \nand how populations are impacted by environmental pollutants; the number of discrimination alle-\ngations and theories that may be asserted in any one complaint under Title VI or the other nondis-\ncrimination statutes; and the volume of the complaints received.” 80 Fed. Reg. at 77,287. Indeed, \n47 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 48 of 57 PageID #:  48\nEPA went so far as to describe the 180-day requirement of its regulations as an “arbitrary dead-\nline[].” Id. \n215.  By agreeing to deadlines that the agency has previously admitted are “unrealistic,” \n“inflexible,” and “impractical” without supplying any contrary reasoning, EPA has acted in an arbi-\ntrary and capricious manner. That is particularly so as EPA itself admitted that its deadlines were \n“arbitrary”—only to then delegate to Private Special Interest Groups the right to compel the agency \nto abide by those admittedly “arbitrary” and “unrealistic” dates. See, e.g., Dillmon v. Nat. Transp. Safety \nBd., 588 F.3d 1085, 1089-90 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“Reasoned decision making, therefore, necessarily re-\nquires the agency to acknowledge and provide an adequate explanation for its departure from estab-\nlished precedent. Applying the corollary of this requirement, ‘agency action is arbitrary and capri-\ncious if it departs from agency precedent without explanation.’” (citation omitted)). \n216.  EPA’s conferral of veto powers to Private Special Interest Groups and March 2023 \ninquiry to those groups as to whether they wished to exercise that veto power with respect to the \ninformal proceedings at issue here are final agency actions within the meaning of the APA. EPA’s \ndecision to delegate to those groups governmental power is in no way “tentative or interlocutory [in] \nnature.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997). And legal consequences have already flowed \nfrom those decisions: the Private Special Interest Groups were unconstitutionally given governmen-\ntal authority that they may not lawfully possess. \n217.  In  addition,  subjecting  the  State  to  governmental  proceedings  in  which  non-\ngovernmental actors possessed veto power over the agency’s exercise of its authority was final agen-\ncy action with respect to the non-delegation issue. \n48 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 49 of 57 PageID #:  49\nCOUNT III \nEPA’s Title VI Disparate-Impact Regulations Exceed The Executives Power Under § 602 \nAsserted Under Asserted Under The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706 And \nNon-Statutory Cause of Action \n218.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n219.  As set forth above, Section 602 does not authorize imposition of disparate-impact-\nbased requirements.  \n220.  EPA’s attempt to impose disparate-impact-based requirements in its Title VI regula-\ntions (e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 7.35) exceeds the agency’s authority under Title VI and is ultra vires. \n221.  Although EPA’s Title VI regulations were last amended in 2010, this Court has au-\nthority to consider the State’s challenge to them. \n222.  The Fifth Circuit has recognized that when “when an agency applies a rule, the limita-\ntions period running from the rule’s publication will not bar a claimant from challenging the agen-\ncy’s statutory authority. Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Int., Inc. v. Nat’l Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th \nCir. 1997). Therefore, “[i]t is possible … to challenge a regulation after the limitations period has \nexpired, provided that the ground for the challenge is that the issuing agency exceeded its constitu-\ntional or statutory authority. To sustain such a challenge, however, the claimant must show some \ndirect, final agency action involving the particular plaintiff within six years of filing suit.” Id.; accord \nAmerican Stewards of Liberty v. DOI, 960 F.3d 223, 229 (5th Cir. 2020) (“[A] plaintiff who misses this \nwindow may still obtain effective review of the regulation by instead bringing a challenge within six \nyears of a later final agency action that applies the regulation to the plaintiff.”).  \n223.  This exception explicitly includes a “challenge … on the grounds that [the regula-\ntion] ‘conflicts with the statute from which its authority derives,’” Weaver v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety \n49 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 50 of 57 PageID #:  50\nAdmin., 744 F.3d 142, 145 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation omitted)—e.g., EPA’s Title VI regulations con-\nflicting with Section 602’s limited grant of authority to “effectuate” Section 601. \n224.  Here, EPA has applied its Title VI regulations to the State’s agencies within the last \nsix years and purported to re-bind LDEQ and LDH to its disparate-impact-based mandates. \n225.  Alternatively, the State asserts this claim as a pre-enforcement challenge to EPA’s \npotential enforcement of Title VI against the State in the form of putative disparate-impact-based \nmandates.  \n226.  The State faces a “credible threat” of enforcement of Title VI by EPA with respect \nto disparate-impact-based mandates. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014) \n227.   The realistic threat of enforcement is particularly apparent given EPA’s October 12, \n2022 Letter of Concern, which provides strong evidence of threatened enforcement of Title VI \nagainst the State with respect to disparate-impact-based requirements. \nCOUNT IV \nDOJ’s Title VI Disparate-Impact Regulations Exceed The Executives Power Under § 602 \nAsserted Under Asserted Under The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706 And \nNon-Statutory Cause of Action  \n228.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n229.  As set forth above, Section 602 does not authorize imposition of disparate-impact-\nbased requirements.  \n230.  DOJ’s attempt to impose disparate-impact-based requirements in its Title VI regula-\ntions (e.g., 40 C.F.R. § 7.35) exceeds the agency’s authority under Title VI and is ultra vires. \n231.  Agencies of the State have received grants from DOJ within the last six years, which \npurport to bind the agencies to DOJ’s disparate-impact-based requirements. \n50 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 51 of 57 PageID #:  51\n232.  In addition, EPA’s Title VI regulations, including their disparate-impact require-\nments, are premised on DOJ’s regulations and necessarily reliant on them for their legal validity. Any \napplication of EPA’s Title VI regulations on the State and its agencies is thus necessarily also an ap-\nplication of DOJ’s regulations on the State. \n233.  DOJ’s Title VI regulations are also challengeable under the reopening doctrine as \nthey relate to the disparate-impact-based requirements. \n234.  “The reopening doctrine allows an otherwise stale challenge to proceed because ‘the \nagency opened the issue up anew,’ and then ‘reexamined and reaffirmed its prior decision.’” P&V \nEnters. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 516 F.3d 1021, 1023-24 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted) \n(cleaned up). Thus, if “the agency opened the issue up anew, and then reexamined and reaffirmed its \nprior decision, the agency’s second action (the reaffirmance) is reviewable.… In that event, the reaf-\nfirmance, rather than the original decision, starts the limitation period. But if the agency merely reaf-\nfirmed its decision without really opening the decision back up and reconsidering it, the agency’s ini-\ntial action is the only final agency action to review—so the limitation period runs from the first deci-\nsion by the agency.” Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 951 (5th Cir. 2021), rev’d on other grounds 142 S. Ct. \n2528 (2022) (cleaned up). \n235.  DOJ effectively reopened its Title VI regulations in December 2020-January 2021. \n236.  On December 21, 2020, DOJ submitted to the Office of Management and Budget \n(“OMB”) a proposed final rule that would have amended DOJ’s Title VI regulations to eliminate \nany disparate-impact-based requirements. See Wagner, Annalise, Note, Rolling Back DOJ’s Title VI \nProtections:  Trump’s  Abandoned  Attempt  and  Potential  Impacts  on  EJ  Enforcement  (Apr.  2021), \nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2021/04/doj-title-vi/. The final rule did so on the basis of DOJ’s view \nthat disparate-impact-based requirements could not be lawfully imposed consistent with Title VI and \nSection 602. Id. \n51 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 52 of 57 PageID #:  52\n237.  OMB approved DOJ’s proposed rule on January 8, 2021. Id. As a result, it should \nhave been published in the Federal Register and become effective 30 days after publication. \n238.  DOJ’s rule was never published in the Federal Register. Upon information and be-\nlief, the Biden Administration prevented the rule from being published and subsequently withdrew \nit. \n239.  Defendants had no lawful basis for delaying publication of the rule and certainly \nhave never supplied any. By indefinitely delaying publication of the final rule adopted by OMB, De-\nfendants violated the APA. See, e.g., Air Alliance Houston v. EPA, 906 F.3d 1049, 1065 (D.C. Cir. \n2018) (Agencies “may not employ delay tactics to effectively repeal a final rule while sidestepping the \nstatutorily mandated process for revising or repealing that rule.”). \n240.  The de facto adoption and subsequent withdrawal of a final rule repealing DOJ Title \nVI disparate-impact regulations constitute reopening within the meaning of the reopening doctrine. \nAs a result, the Biden Administration’s “reaffirmance [of Title VI disparate-impact regulations], ra-\nther than the original decision, starts the limitation period.” Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th at 951 (cleaned \nup). \nCOUNT V \nDefendants’ Disparate-Impact-Based Title VI Mandates Violate The Spending Clause \nAsserted Under The Constitution, Federal Courts’ Equitable Powers, The Non-Statutory \nCause Of Action, And The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706 \n241.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n242.  Article I of the U.S. Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress. \n243.  Article I, § 8, cl. 1 empowers Congress to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts \nand Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the \nUnited States.” \n52 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 53 of 57 PageID #:  53\n244.  While Congress may provide conditional grants to the states under the Spending \nClause, those conditions are subject to several limitations, including that “if Congress desires to \ncondition the States’ receipt of federal funds, it ‘must do so unambiguously.’” Dole, 483 U.S. at 207 \n(quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). \n245.  Because Title VI generally, and Section 602 in particular, do not unambiguously \n(1) impose disparate-impact requirements or (2) give Defendants authority to impose such require-\nments, Defendants’ attempt to impose disparate-impact-based mandates on the States runs afoul of \nthis Spending Clause requirement. \n246.  As a result, Defendants’ attempt to impose disparate-impact-based requirements up-\non the State under Title VI violates the Constitution. For similar reasons, Defendants’ attempts to \nimpose disparate-impact-based requirements under Title VI are ultra vires agency actions. \nCOUNT VI \nEPA’s Attempt To Impose Extra-Regulatory Requirements Violates The Constitution Un-\nder Article II Vesting Clause And Separation Of Powers And Is Ultra Vires \nAsserted Under The Constitution, Federal Courts’ Equitable Powers, And Non-Statutory \nCause Of Action \n247.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n248.  Although Congress may delegate authority to agencies, “an agency literally has no \npower to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until \nCongress confers power upon it.” Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 357 (1986). \n249.  To implement any regulations or requirements under Title VI, agencies are required \nto comply with the APA. See generally 5 § 501 et seq. By attempting to impose requirements that have \nnever been adopted through APA-compliant procedures, Defendants are acting in an ultra vires man-\nner here. \n53 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 54 of 57 PageID #:  54\n250.  In addition to the APA generally, Title VI imposes a specific and explicit mandate \nthat any “rule, regulation, or order [implementing Title VI] shall [not] become effective unless and \nuntil approved by the President.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 (emphasis added). \n251.  Congress thus conditioned the delegation of any implementing authority to agencies \nupon receiving the requisite Presidential approval. Any attempt to impose requirements not ratified \nby the President (or those delegated to exercise that power on his behalf) thus violates the Constitu-\ntion, by exercising authority that Congress has not delegated to the agency. \n252.  In addition, EPA has attempted to impose upon the State requirements that the \nagency itself does not follow itself, such as cumulative-impacts-analysis mandates. In doing so, EPA \nhas violated Section 602’s mandate that “rules, regulations, or orders” effectuating Section 601 must \nbe “of general applicability.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n253.  EPA’s attempts to impose extra-regulatory requirements here thus violates the Con-\nstitution, Title VI, and the APA, and are ultra vires. \nCOUNT VII \nEPA’s “Parallel Tracks” Violates Its Title VI regulations \nAsserted Under The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706 \n254.  The State repeats and incorporates by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n255.  EPA’s regulations, including 40 C.F.R. §7.115 and 7.120, establish the processes that \nEPA must follow when investigating and resolving Title VI complaints. \n256.  40  C.F.R.  §7.120(d),  titled  “Complaint  processing  procedures,”  establishes  a  se-\nquence that EPA must follow when evaluating Title VI complaints. That regulation further provides \nthat  “OCR  shall  attempt  to  resolve  complaints  informally  whenever  possible.”  40  C.F.R. \n54 \n\nCase 2:23-cv-00692-JDC-KK   Document 1   Filed 05/24/23   Page 55 of 57 PageID #:  55\n§7.120(d)(2). Only “[w]hen a complaint cannot be resolved informally, OCR shall follow the proce-\ndures established by paragraphs (c) through (e) of § 7.115.” Id. \n257.  EPA thus may only proceed to “follow the procedures established by paragraphs (c) \nthrough (e) of § 7.115” after it was determined that “a complaint cannot be resolved informally.” Id. \n258.  EPA has violated the sequencing required by its regulations here. As explained \nabove, EPA has begun the compliance processes of § 7.115 by, in Dorka’s description, “continu[ing] \nits fact-finding on a parallel track with the IRA process to ensure that EPA … is in a position to re-\nsolve the complaint through the issuance of Preliminary Findings, should EPA and LDEQ not be \nable to reach an IRA by the agreed upon date.” \n259.  By proceeding to the processes of § 7.115 without first concluding that the “com-\nplaint cannot be resolved informally” and terminating informal resolution proceedings, EPA has \nviolated the sequencing requirement of 40 C.F.R. §7.120(d). \n260.  EPA’s decision to proceed to the processes of § 7.115 is final agency action within \nthe meaning of the APA. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nNOW, THEREFORE, Plaintiffs request an order and judgment: \n1.  Declaring, under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that EPA’s delegation of governmental power to the \nPrivate Special Interest Groups is unconstitutional and/or arbitrary and capricious;  \n2.  Declaring, under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that EPA’s and DOJ’s regulations purporting to im-\npose disparate-impact-based requirements under Title VI are unlawful;  \n3.
