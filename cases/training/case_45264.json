    "summary": "<p>On November 15, 2017, a group of homeless individuals sued the City of San Diego, alleging that the city's enforcement of parking and vehicle habitation ordinances against them was a violation of their Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment) and Fourteenth Amendment (substantive due process, right to travel and equal protection) rights. Plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of \"All persons in the City of San Diego who used, use, or will use an RV or other vehicle as their only form of shelter at any time after November 15, 2017\". Additionally, plaintiffs requested a \"Disability Sub-class\" consisting of \"Members who have a &lsquo;disability&rsquo; as defined under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12102, which limits their ability to comply with the City&rsquo;s ordinances that prevent people from using vehicles as shelter and/or which makes them particularly vulnerable to harm from the City&rsquo;s enforcement of the<br />ordinances.&rdquo; This case was presided over by Judge J. Paul Oetken. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, and Disability Rights California, claimed the City's enforcement of its nighttime RV parking ordinance and its vehicle habitation ordinance targeted homeless vehicle owners, ticketing them and impounding their vehicles for unpaid tickets. Plaintiffs asserted that due to a housing crisis and lack of reasonable shelter options, plaintiffs were forced to use vehicles for shelter. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant's actions violated their rights under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983), the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 12132), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. &sect; 794), the U.S. and California Constitutions, and California Civil Code &sect; 52.1 (Bane Act).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop the enforcement of these ordinances against homeless individuals, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 14, 2018, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding two new named plaintiffs. On February 28, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On April 30, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. On June 7, 2018, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. On August 21, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. On April 30, 2020, plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for Temporary Restraining Order. On May 1, 2020 plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint. On May 13,2020 the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order.</p>\r\n<p>On December 21, 2020 plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. On June 8, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' renewed motion for class certification. Specifically, the court certified the main class of \"All persons in the City of San Diego who used, use, or will use an RV or other vehicle as their only form of shelter, anywhere, at any time, after November 15, 2017.\" However, the court denied the certification of the Disability Sub-Class.</p>\r\n<p>On September 22, 2022 plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On April 10, 2023, parties reached a settlement agreement, which received preliminary approval by the court on March 15, 2024 (and received final approval on October 10, 2024). The main terms of the settlement include defendants forgiving certain outstanding tickets for class members, limiting the enforcement of Vehicle Habitation Ordinance (VHO) such as by not enforcing it against those living in their vehicle, limiting the enforcement of the Oversized Vehicle Ordinance (OVO), expanding the City's designated parking program, and complying in good faith with ADA-related requests by class members. The Agreement did not provide monetary damages for class members, however, individual class members were still permitted to bring their own claims for monetary damages. The City agreed to pay attorneys' fees and expenses, as well as up to $25,000 in costs necessary to monitor compliance with the Settlement Agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 8, 2024, plaintiffs filed two unopposed motions: a motion for final approval of class action settlement and motion for attorneys' fees. On October 10, 2024, the court granted both motions. Final judgment was entered October 15, 2024, and the case was closed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for settlement enforcement, arguing that the defendants had not complied with the settlement agreement. Plaintiffs alleged that the city refused to remove VHO and OVO signs which misstated the terms of the settlement agreement. Plaintiffs attempted to resolve these issues through multiple meetings with the City, but they did not reached a solution. Plaintiffs requested the court to order the defendants to modify or remove these signs as well as reimburse plaintiffs for attorney's fees related to this motion.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 21, 2025, the court has not yet ruled on this motion.&nbsp;</p>",

There are at least \n66 817 unsheltered homeless residents in San Diego, many with disabilities, who seek \n77 shelter in their recreational vehicles (“RVs”), campers, or other vehicles.  For these \n88 people, their vehicles are their only reliable, safe shelter from the elements and only \n99 place to store their belongings.  Yet, even though there are no adequate alternatives, the \n1100 City has repeatedly ticketed and harassed these individuals for seeking shelter in their \n1111 vehicles or simply for owning vehicles and having nowhere else to park.  Specifically, \n1122 the City has used its ordinance prohibiting RV parking from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM, San \n1133 Diego  Muni.  Code  § 86.0139(a)  (“the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance”),  and  its \n1144 ordinance prohibiting vehicle habitation, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0137(f) (“the \n1155 vehicle habitation ordinance”), to target homeless vehicle owners, ticketing them and \n1166 impounding their vehicles for unpaid tickets.  In addition, the City has threatened \n1177 homeless vehicle owners with arrest and misdemeanor charges for illegal lodging. \n1188   Even after being alerted to these issues, the City has refused to modify its \n1199 policies to provide an opportunity for homeless individuals to park their vehicles \n2200 legally on City streets or other public property, at least until affordable, accessible, and \n2211 medically appropriate housing is made available to them.  While failing to provide any \n2222 accommodation for homeless individuals, including those with disabilities, the City \n2233 has created an exemption to the nighttime RV parking ordinance, via a permit system, \n2244 for persons who have a physical address.  In other words, under certain circumstances, \n2255 the City allows people who are not homeless to park their RVs overnight, but imposes \n2266 penalties against those who are homeless for the same behavior. \n2277   The  City  has  carried  out  this  discriminatory,  cruel,  punitive,  and \n2288 unconstitutional  policy  against  homeless  vehicle  owners,  many  of  whom  have \n  1 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.4     Page 4 of 44\n \n11 disabilities, despite the fact that these individuals have nowhere else to go.  Sky-high \n22 rents and extremely low incomes, among other factors, have excluded these City \n33 residents  from  the  housing  market.    RV  parks  are  often  as  costly  as  renting  an \n44 apartment, and so are not viable options.  “Safe lots” that allow overnight parking for \n55 homeless individuals do not accept RVs and have far fewer spaces than the number of \n66 homeless persons with vehicles in San Diego.  The number of unsheltered homeless \n77 people far outnumbers available emergency shelter beds, which are generally filled and \n88 cannot accommodate the hundreds of people who are forced to seek shelter in their \n99 vehicles.    Moreover,  emergency  and  temporary  shelter  beds  are  functionally \n1100 unavailable to many homeless people with disabilities because the conditions in the \n1111 shelter environment are not medically acceptable given those disabilities.  Homeless \n1122 vehicle owners therefore do not have either a place to seek shelter in their vehicles \n1133 legally in the City or the availability of adequate, accessible, and medically appropriate \n1144 housing that they can afford.  In addition, homeless vehicle owners have no funds with \n1155 which to pay the excessive fines associated with the nighttime RV parking and vehicle \n1166 habitation citations without jeopardizing their ability to buy food, medicine, or other \n1177 necessities.  As a result, homeless vehicle owners have had and are at risk of having \n1188 their only shelter taken away by the City for unpaid tickets. \n1199   The nighttime RV parking ordinance and vehicle habitation ordinance \n2200 both  violate  numerous  U.S.  and  State  Constitutional  rights,  including  the  Eighth \n2211 Amendment  prohibition  on  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment  and  the  Fourteenth \n2222 Amendment Substantive Due Process protections, including the prohibition on reckless \n2233 endangerment; the Right to Equal Protection; and the Right to Travel.  The vehicle \n2244 habitation ordinance is also so vague and ambiguously worded that neither homeless \n2255 individuals nor anyone else can ascertain what is or is not prohibited or how to comply \n2266 with the ordinance to avoid receiving a ticket or having their vehicle impounded.  In \n2277 addition, enforcement of the ordinances discriminates against homeless vehicle owners \n2288 based on disability in violation of the antidiscrimination protections of Title II of the \n  2 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.5     Page 5 of 44\n \n11 Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n22   Rather than adequately accommodating this homeless, largely disabled \n33 group of individuals and complying with statutory and constitutional requirements, the \n44 City has instead chosen to place the health, safety, and lives of homeless vehicle owners \n55 in further jeopardy, in the hope that the continuing and escalating harassment will force \n66 these residents simply to leave town. \n77   Plaintiffs seek a Court order requiring that the City put an end to these \n88 harmful, discriminatory, and unconstitutional practices against this defenseless group \n99 of individuals. \n1100 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1111   The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and \n1122 1343, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Plaintiffs’ claims arise under \n1133 the laws and Constitution of the United States.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, this \n1144 Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law and state constitutional claims \n1155 because Plaintiffs’ state claims are related to Plaintiffs’ federal claims, arise out of a \n1166 common nucleus of operative facts and form part of the same case or controversy under \n1177 Article III of the U.S. Constitution. \n1188   Venue is proper in the Southern District of California because Defendants \n1199 reside in the District and all events given rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the \n2200 District.  The relief Plaintiffs seek is within this Court’s power to grant. \n2211 PARTIES \n2222 A.  Plaintiffs \n2233   Plaintiff MICHAEL BLOOM is 68 years-old and a life-long resident of \n2244 the City of San Diego.  Mr. Bloom previously worked as an electrician and carpenter \n2255 but suffered several accidents that left him with a severely damaged arm and foot, and \n2266 led to his suffering from hypoglycemia and severe depression.  Because of these \n2277 debilitating physical and mental health issues, Mr. Bloom has not been able to engage \n2288 in gainful employment since his last accident in 1982.  His sole source of income is \n  3 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.6     Page 6 of 44\n \n11 Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  Even if Mr. \n22 Bloom were able to locate an open bed at an emergency or temporary shelter, which \n33 are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of homeless people who \n44 currently seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally unavailable to him \n55 because his physical disabilities require him to lie down frequently during the day and \n66 the overcrowding and lack of privacy would worsen his mental health condition.  As a \n77 result, for the last ten years, his only available shelter has been his RV.  Mr. Bloom is \n88 not able to park his RV in the existing City “safe lots” because the “safe lots” do not \n99 allow RVs.  Despite this, and even though he has a disability placard on his vehicle, \n1100 Mr. Bloom has received at least a dozen tickets for parking his RV at night on city \n1111 streets, about five tickets for vehicle habitation, and has been threatened with arrest for \n1122 vehicle habitation.  When he has paid these tickets, Mr. Bloom has not had enough \n1133 money to pay for food or gasoline.  If Mr. Bloom does not pay the tickets, however, \n1144 the City may impound his RV, which would be devastating for his mental and physical \n1155 health and put him at far greater physical risk.  It would also leave Mr. Bloom without \n1166 the  only  form  of  shelter  available  to  him.    Mr.  Bloom  meets  the  definition  of \n1177 “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations issued by the U.S. Department of \n1188 Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  24 C.F.R. § 91.5(1).  Mr. Bloom is also a \n1199 qualified  individual  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of  the  Americans  With \n2200 Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12102, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \n2211 U.S.C. § 706(8). \n2222   Plaintiff STEPHEN CHATZKY is 70 years old and resides in the City of \n2233 San Diego with his domestic partner, Suzonne Keith, and her disabled adult daughter.  \n2244 Mr. Chatzky is a lawyer, but his Attention Deficit Disorder and memory problems have \n2255 made it difficult for him practice law.  As a result, since 2002, his sole source of income \n2266 has been Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  \n2277 Even if Mr. Chatzky were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or emergency \n2288 shelter, which are generally filled and cannot accommodate the hundreds of homeless \n  4 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.7     Page 7 of 44\n \n11 people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally unavailable to \n22 him because shelter conditions would force the family to separate.  A psychologist who \n33 evaluated Mr. Chatzky opined that if Mr. Chatzky were separated from his family, it \n44 would worsen his mental health condition.  Additionally, Mr. Chatzky has asthma and \n55 sleep apnea and is prone to lung infections.  Shelters typically reek of tobacco smoke, \n66 which make it difficult for him to breathe and put him at risk for lung infections.  \n77 Because of these circumstances, the family has lived in an RV since 2008.  The City of \n88 San Diego impounded the family’s first RV for failure to pay tickets, including tickets \n99 for  nighttime  RV  parking  and  vehicle  habitation,  even  though  the  family  had  a \n1100 disability placard on the vehicle at that time.  After the impoundment, the family had \n1111 no regular shelter, and they were forced to sleep cramped in a car for five months until \n1122 they were able to obtain another RV through a family member’s assistance.  Because \n1133 Mr. Chatzky and Ms. Keith live in an RV, they are unable to utilize existing City “safe \n1144 lots” because “safe lots” do not accept RVs.  As a result, Mr. Chatzky and Ms. Keith \n1155 continue to receive tickets for parking their RV at night.  Mr. Chatzky meets the \n1166 definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by HUD regulations and is a qualified \n1177 individual with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n1188   Plaintiff SUZONNE KEITH is 68 years old and a resident of the City of \n1199 San Diego.  Ms. Keith has held a range of government jobs, including as an equal rights \n2200 investigator, but her disabilities have made her unable to engage in gainful employment \n2211 for the last 19 years.  She has severe arthritis and edema that interfere with her ability \n2222 to stand or walk, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) from \n2233 having survived domestic violence prior to meeting Mr. Chatzky, and debilitating \n2244 migraines.  Ms. Keith’s sole source of income is a pension of $400 per month, and she \n2255 cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  As a result, Ms. Keith’s only option for shelter \n2266 has been to live in an RV with Mr. Chatzky and her daughter.  After the couple’s first \n2277 RV was impounded for not paying parking tickets, the couple slept cramped in a car \n2288 for five months.  Because the police continue to ticket the couple, Ms. Keith is terrified \n  5 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.8     Page 8 of 44\n \n11 that the City will also impound their second RV, which is the only form of shelter \n22 available to her.  Even if Ms. Keith were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n33 emergency shelter, which are generally filled and cannot accommodate the hundreds \n44 of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n55 unavailable to her because it would require that Ms. Keith be separated from Mr. \n66 Chatzky and her adult daughter, triggering her trauma symptoms and worsening her \n77 depression.  Additionally, the conditions of shelters, including the high noise level, \n88 triggers migraines for Ms. Keith.  When Ms. Keith is suffering from a debilitating \n99 migraine, she needs to rest in a private and dark space, which is usually not available \n1100 at shelters.  Ms. Keith is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning of \n1111 the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and meets the definition of “chronically homeless” \n1122 as defined by the HUD regulations. \n1133   Plaintiff TONY DIAZ is 58 years old and a resident of the City of San \n1144 Diego.  Mr. Diaz worked as a welder until 2011, when worsening pain and other \n1155 symptoms of his anxiety disorder, diabetes, hypertension, severe respiratory problems, \n1166 and bad knee and shoulder prevented him from working.  He also recently had major \n1177 heart surgery.  Mr. Diaz has been homeless for approximately five years and owns a \n1188 pick-up  truck  with  a  shell  that  serves  as  his  only  shelter  and  place  to  keep  his \n1199 belongings.  He has no regular income, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  \n2200 Mr. Diaz has received four vehicle habitation tickets, even though he spends nights \n2211 parked at a local 7-Eleven store with the permission of the manager and does not sleep \n2222 in his vehicle when it is parked on City property.  On August 25, 2016 at approximately \n2233 6:30 a.m., Mr. Diaz came out of a bathroom in a public park when a member of the San \n2244 Diego Police Department issued him a vehicle habitation ticket.  Mr. Diaz explained to \n2255 the officer that he had just arrived to go fishing and told the officer that he was disabled \n2266 and had just had heart surgery.  The officer nonetheless issued the ticket and threatened \n2277 to ticket him anytime he saw Mr. Diaz’s vehicle.  The officer also threatened to have \n2288 Mr. Diaz arrested for vehicle habitation.  Since that incident, police officers have \n  6 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.9     Page 9 of 44\n \n11 continued to harass and ticket Mr. Diaz under the vehicle habitation ordinance.  Mr. \n22 Diaz has done his best to comply with the vehicle habitation ordinance by parking \n33 overnight on private property with the owner’s permission but does not understand \n44 what he needs to do in order to stop the ticketing.  Even if Mr. Diaz were able to locate \n55 an open bed at a temporary or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot \n66 accommodate the hundreds of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, \n77 it would be functionally unavailable to him because the tobacco smoke, cleaning fluid \n88 odors, and lack of fresh air would aggravate his respiratory condition.  Moreover, the \n99 crowded, noisy, and regimented environment of shelters would worsen his symptoms \n1100 of anxiety.  Mr. Diaz is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning of \n1111 the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  He also meets the definition of “chronically \n1122 homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n1133   Plaintiff VALERIE GRISCHY is 58 years old and a resident of the City \n1144 of San Diego.  Ms. Grischy was a licensed chiropractor and had a successful career, \n1155 until she became disabled by a serious car accident in 2009.  Since shortly after the \n1166 accident, she has been unable to work due to severe back pain, depression, anxiety, and \n1177 panic attacks stemming from a traumatic brain injury and PTSD.  Ms. Grischy’s sole \n1188 source of income is Supplementary Security Income (SSI), and she cannot afford \n1199 market rents in San Diego.  Because she has not been able to afford housing, Ms. \n2200 Grischy has been living in her RV since 2012.  She has received tickets from the City \n2211 of San Diego for vehicle habitation and nighttime RV parking even though she has a \n2222 disability placard on the vehicle.  Ms. Grischy has tried to find places to park, driving \n2233 up to 30 miles a day, in an attempt to avoid being ticketed.  Despite her efforts, Ms. \n2244 Grischy continued to receive written warnings and tickets from police.  Paying these \n2255 parking tickets would be a severe financial hardship for her.  The threat of ticketing \n2266 also forced her to leave San Diego temporarily, which she considers her home, to avoid \n2277 further ticketing.  Even if Ms. Grischy were able to locate an open bed at a temporary \n2288 or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds \n  7 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.10     Page 10 of\n44\n \n11 of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n22 unavailable to her because her medical history and medical needs require that she live \n33 alone.  Communal shelter life is simply untenable.  The current City “safe lots” are not \n44 an option for Ms. Grischy because RVs are not allowed in those lots.  Ms. Grischy is a \n55 qualified  individual  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of  the  ADA  and  the \n66 Rehabilitation Act.  She also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined \n77 by HUD regulations. \n88   Plaintiff PENNY “GRACE” HELMS is 58 years old and a resident of the \n99 City of San Diego.  Ms. Helms supported herself throughout her 20s working as a \n1100 waiter and dancer.  At the age of 29, the long-term effects of chronic illnesses, and the \n1111 physical and emotional trauma that she experienced as a child, became so debilitating \n1122 that she had to stop working.  Ms. Helms suffers from fibromyalgia; chronic fatigue \n1133 syndrome; arthritis; six bulging disks; hypersensitivity and allergy to environmental \n1144 pollutants such as cigarette smoke and perfume; and various neurological disorders \n1155 including PTSD, hypervigilance, emotional hypersensitivity, and dissociative identity \n1166 disorder.  Over the past two decades, she has tried to earn a living by working as a \n1177 house cleaner, dog groomer, among other jobs, whenever her disabilities permit.  But \n1188 none of that income has been steady or sufficient for her to support herself, and that \n1199 income has only fallen over the years.  Ms. Helms’ main, and often the only, source of \n2200 income for the past few years has been Social Security disability benefits.  She cannot \n2211 afford market rents in San Diego.  Because of this, Ms. Helms had been forced to seek \n2222 shelter in her RV.  She has been threatened multiple times by police with ticketing for \n2233 vehicle habitation and impoundment for living in her RV.  She has also been threatened \n2244 with arrest for encroachment near her RV.  The threat of receiving citations she cannot \n2255 afford to pay, impoundment, and arrest terrifies her and exacerbates her disabilities, \n2266 including her hypervigilance.  She has recently left San Diego for periods of weeks due \n2277 to her fear of being ticketed, arrested, and having her RV impounded.  Ms. Helms \n2288 currently does not have a place in San Diego where she can safely park or seek shelter \n  8 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.11     Page 11 of\n44\n \n11 in her RV.  Even if Ms. Helms were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n22 emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n33 homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n44 unavailable to her because she cannot tolerate communal living given her myriad \n55 disabilities.  The current City “safe lots” are not an option for Ms. Helms because RVs \n66 are not allowed.  Ms. Helms is a qualified individual with disabilities within the \n77 meaning of the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act.  She also meets the definition of \n88 “chronically homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n99   Plaintiff BENJAMIN HERNANDEZ is a 54-year-old man and a resident \n1100 of the City of San Diego.  Mr. Hernandez was a stonemason and primary breadwinner \n1111 for his family until he was involved in a pedestrian accident in 2015.  After the accident, \n1122 the orthopedic impairments from his injuries, along with depression, left him unable to \n1133 work.  Mr. Hernandez was only given a small, one-time disability award and does not \n1144 receive ongoing disability benefits.  Though his wife works, her wages are extremely \n1155 modest and insufficient to afford the high cost of housing in San Diego.  Their lack of \n1166 funds has caused Mr. Hernandez and his wife to utilize their RV as their primary shelter \n1177 for the past year.  On July 26, 2017, however, the City impounded their RV for unpaid \n1188 nighttime RV parking citations.  Since they cannot afford to pay the citations in order \n1199 to retrieve their RV from impoundment, the couple is now forced to use his truck as \n2200 shelter from the elements.  Now in his truck, Mr. Hernandez remains at risk for vehicle \n2211 habitation tickets.  Even if Mr. Hernandez were able to locate an open bed at a \n2222 temporary or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the \n2233 hundreds of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be \n2244 functionally unavailable to him because it would force him to separate from his wife, \n2255 significantly worsening his depression.  Mr. Hernandez is a qualified individual with \n2266 disabilities within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, and California law.  \n2277 He also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations \n2288 issued by HUD. \n  9 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.12     Page 12 of\n44\n \n11   Plaintiff DOUG HIGGINS is 68 years old, a resident of the City of San \n22 Diego, and a veteran who was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army.  He had a \n33 successful career as a car dealer until his symptoms of anxiety and depression, along \n44 with a painful back condition, worsened in 2009.  His bad back, which is aggravated \n55 by stress, keeps him from standing, sitting, or walking for any length of time.  His sole \n66 source of income is Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford to pay market rent \n77 in San Diego.  Even if Mr. Higgins were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n88 emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n99 homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n1100 unavailable to him because it would exacerbate his mental health symptoms.  For the \n1111 past three years, his RV has been the only shelter available to him.  Mr. Higgins has \n1122 received tickets both for vehicle habitation and for nighttime RV parking, but paying \n1133 the tickets jeopardizes his ability to pay for food and other necessities.  The threat of \n1144 ticketing and fear of losing his RV to impoundment increases his stress and exacerbates \n1155 the symptoms of his disabilities.  Police have told him to leave the City if he does not \n1166 like the ticketing, but he considers San Diego to be his home.  Mr. Higgins is a qualified \n1177 individual with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n1188 Mr. Higgins also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the \n1199 regulations issued by HUD. \n2200   Plaintiff DAVID WILSON is 47 years old and a resident of the City of \n2211 San Diego.  Mr. Wilson previously worked as an actor, taxi driver, and security guard.  \n2222 Mr.  Wilson  has  a  range  of  conditions  arising  from  a  car  accident,  including \n2233 compression  of  the  spine,  peripheral  neuropathy,  edema  in  both  feet  and  ankles \n2244 (requiring him to elevate his feet), depression, PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder, an \n2255 eating disorder, and porphyria (a skin condition that makes him highly susceptible to \n2266 infection).  Mr. Wilson also suffers from asthma, hypersomnia (a condition in which a \n2277 person has trouble staying awake during the day), and social anxiety.  Because of these \n2288 conditions, Mr. Wilson had to stop working in 1999.  His sole source of income is SSI, \n  10 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.13     Page 13 of\n44\n \n11 and he cannot afford to pay market rent in San Diego.  In 2013, Mr. Wilson purchased \n22 an RV, giving him a place to lie down and take shelter from the elements.  Mr. Wilson \n33 has received numerous tickets from the City of San Diego, including for vehicle \n44 habitation and nighttime RV parking, and has been threatened with arrest for vehicle \n55 habitation.  This happened despite his having a disabled placard on the vehicle.  In an \n66 attempt to save the little money he has to pay the tickets, Mr. Wilson has resorted to \n77 eating out of the trash.  Ultimately unable to pay all the tickets, Mr. Wilson sold his RV \n88 in December 2015 to avoid imminent impoundment and purchased a truck with the \n99 proceeds.  Deprived of his RV, he began sleeping outside or cramped in the cab of the \n1100 truck.  Without a proper place to lie down and elevate his feet, and forced to sleep \n1111 outside or in his truck, Mr. Wilson ended up hospitalized soon after losing his RV to \n1122 impoundment.  Even if Mr. Wilson were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n1133 emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n1144 homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n1155 unavailable  to  him  because  the  crowded  and  noisy  shelter  environment  would \n1166 aggravate  Mr.  Wilson’s  mental  health  conditions  and,  due  to  his  vulnerability  to \n1177 infection and asthma, put his physical condition at further risk.  Police have also \n1188 continued to issue Mr. Wilson warnings and threatened him with further ticketing for \n1199 vehicle habitation in his truck, which is the only reasonable form of shelter available \n2200 to him.  Mr. Wilson is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning of the \n2211 ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Mr. Wilson also meets the definition of “chronically \n2222 homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n2233   The term “Named Plaintiffs” or “Plaintiffs” refers to all the individual \n2244 Plaintiffs named in this section. \n2255 B.  Defendants \n2266   Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO is now, and at all times mentioned in \n2277 this  Complaint,  was  a  local  government  agency  and  subdivision  of  the  State  of \n2288 California.  Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO, through its agents the Mayor, City \n  11 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.14     Page 14 of\n44\n \n11 Council, City Attorney, Parking Enforcement, Police Department, and the Police Chief \n22 undertakes to cite Plaintiffs and Class members for nighttime RV parking and for \n33 vehicle  habitation.    Defendant  CITY  OF  SAN  DIEGO  also  demands  exorbitant \n44 penalties that Plaintiffs and Class members cannot afford to pay, impounds and/or \n55 threatens to impound their RVs or other vehicles, and threatens them with arrest, all \n66 the while refusing to provide reasonable modifications of these policies based on \n77 Plaintiffs’  and  Class  members’  disabilities.    Defendant  CITY  OF  SAN  DIEGO \n88 implements the ticketing and impoundment of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ vehicles \n99 under the nighttime RV parking ordinance and the vehicle habitation ordinance even \n1100 though Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ vehicles are the only shelter from the elements \n1111 available to them and the only secure place they have to keep their belongings.  In \n1122 addition, the Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO has threatened Plaintiffs and Class \n1133 members with arrest and misdemeanor charges for illegal lodging. \n1144   Defendant KEVIN FAULCONER is the Mayor of the City of San Diego \n1155 and sued in his official capacity only as an elected official responsible in whole or in \n1166 part for designing and/or carrying out the above-described anti-homeless enforcement \n1177 policies against Plaintiffs and Class members. \n1188   Defendants  DAVID  ALVAREZ,  BARBARA  BRY,  CHRIS  CATE, \n1199 MYRTLE COLE, GEORGETTE GOMEZ, MARK KERSE, SCOTT SHERMAN, \n2200 CHRIS WARD AND LORI ZAPF, are members of the San Diego City Council and \n2211 sued in their official capacities only as elected officials who are responsible in whole \n2222 or in part for designing and/or implementing the anti-homeless enforcement policies \n2233 challenged herein.  \n2244   Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT is the City’s \n2255 law enforcement department, which is involved in enforcement of the City’s parking \n2266 and habitation regulations, including the nighttime RV parking ordinance and the \n2277 vehicle habitation ordinance at issue in this Complaint.  \n2288   Defendant SHELLEY ZIMMERMAN is the duly appointed Chief of \n  12 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.15     Page 15 of\n44\n \n11 Police for the City of San Diego that is authorized to appoint, direct, and supervise the \n22 personnel of the Police Department and exercises all powers and duties provided by \n33 general laws or by ordinances of the City Council, including through the San Diego \n44 Police Department’s Parking Enforcement Unit.  Ms. Zimmerman is sued only in her \n55 official capacity. \n66 CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n77   Plaintiffs bring this action against Defendants on their own behalf and on \n88 behalf of all other persons similarly situated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n99 23(b)(2). \n1100   The main class, referred to as the “Homeless Ticketing Class” or “Main \n1111 Class” is defined as: \n1122 All homeless persons who have been cited and/or subject to citation by \n1133 the City of San Diego pursuant to San Diego Muni. Code §§ 86.0137(f); \n1144 San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0139(a); and/or are at risk of arrest for illegal \n1155 lodging. \n1166   Plaintiffs also bring this action on behalf of a subclass, referred to as the \n1177 “Disability Subclass” or “Subclass,” which is defined as: \n1188 All Class members who have a “disability” as defined under the ADA, 42 \n1199 U.S.C. § 12102. \n2200   All members of the Subclass are also members of the Main Class.  The \n2211 terms “Class” and “Classes” refers to both the Main Class and the Subclass collectively. \n2222   Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend or modify the Class definitions in \n2233 connection with a motion for class certification and/or with the result of discovery. \n2244 Numerosity \n2255 Main Class \n2266   Plaintiffs do not know the exact size or identities of the Class.  However, \n2277 Plaintiffs believe that the Class encompasses a minimum of several hundred homeless \n2288 individuals who are dispersed geographically throughout the City of San Diego as well \n  13 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.16     Page 16 of\n44\n \n11 as California and neighboring states.

Therefore,  the  members  of  the  Class  are  so \n44 numerous that individual joinder of all members is impracticable. \n55   All members of the Class are subject to Defendants’ policies and practice \n66 in enforcing the nighttime RV parking ordinance /or the vehicle habitation ordinance.  \n77 The Class is united in its interests with respect to proof of Defendants’ conduct, and \n88 the effects caused by Defendants’ actions.   \n99 Subclass \n1100   Plaintiffs  do  not  know  the  exact  size  or  identities  of  the  Disability \n1111 Subclass.    Plaintiffs  believe  that  the  Subclass  consists  of  hundreds  of  homeless \n1122 individuals based on the high number of persons with disabilities found in surveys of \n1133 the homeless population in San Diego.  See ¶ 43, infra. \n1144   All members of the Sub-Class are subject to Defendants’ discriminatory \n1155 policies and practice in enforcing the nighttime RV parking ordinance and/or the \n1166 vehicle habitation ordinance.  The Class is united in its interests with respect to proof \n1177 of Defendants’ discriminatory conduct, and the effects caused by Defendants’ actions. \n1188 Predominance of Common Issues \n1199 Main Class \n2200   The  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  members  of  the  Class \n2211 predominate over questions that may affect individual Class members.  Such common \n2222 questions of law and fact include but are not limited to the following: \n2233 (i)  whether  Defendants’  enforcement  of  San  Diego  Muni.  Code \n2244 §§ 86.0137(f) and 86.0139(a) has and continues to violate 42 U.S.C. \n2255 § 1983  by  infringing  upon  Named  Plaintiffs’  and  Class  members’ \n2266 constitutional rights, including by recklessly endangering Plaintiffs and \n2277 Class  members,  and  by  violating  their  right  to  travel,  right  to  equal \n2288 protection, and right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.   \n  14 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.17     Page 17 of\n44\n \n11 (ii)  whether Named Plaintiffs and other Class members are at risk of arrest for \n22 illegal  lodging  under  Defendants’  existing  policies  because  they  are \n33 homeless and need to live in their vehicles; \n44 (iii)  whether Named Plaintiffs and other Class members are at risk that their \n55 RV, camper or other vehicle will be impounded by the City for unpaid \n66 tickets  along  with  their  personal  belongings  seized  because  they  are \n77 homeless and need to use their vehicles as shelter;  \n88 (iv)  whether Named Plaintiffs and the other Class members are entitled to \n99 equitable relief, including system-wide policy changes to address the \n1100 constitutional and statutory violations detailed in this Complaint. \n1111 Subclass \n1122 (i)  whether  Defendants’  policies,  including  their  policies  regarding \n1133 enforcement  of  San  Diego  Muni.  Code  §§  86.0137(f)  and  86.0139(a) \n1144 discriminate on the basis of disability; and \n1155 (ii)  whether Defendants have failed or refused to provide reasonable \n1166 modifications of their policies as required under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, \n1177 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 749. \n1188 Typicality \n1199 Main Class \n2200   Named Plaintiffs are asserting claims typical of the claims of the entire \n2211 class of affected persons described above and do not conflict with the interests of any \n2222 other members of the Classes.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members have been injured \n2233 by  the  same  wrongful  policies,  practices,  and  conduct  of  Defendants.    Named \n2244 Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same practices and conduct that give rise to the claims \n2255 of all Class members and are based on the same legal theories. \n2266 Subclass \n2277   Named Plaintiffs are all qualified individuals with disabilities and assert \n2288 claims typical of the claims of the entire Disability Subclass.  The interests of the \n  15 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.18     Page 18 of\n44\n \n11 Named Plaintiffs do not conflict with those of the Disability Subclass.  All have been \n22 injured by the same wrongful policies, practices, and conduct of Defendants, which \n33 discriminate on the basis of disability.  Named Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same \n44 practices and conduct that give rise of all Subclass members and are based on the same \n55 legal theories. \n66 Adequate Representation \n77   Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \n88 Main Class and the Subclass, and they have no interests antagonistic to those of the \n99 Classes.    Indeed,  Named  Plaintiffs’  interests  are  aligned  with  those  of  the  Class \n1100 members.  Named Plaintiffs have retained lawyers who are competent and experienced \n1111 in class action litigation. \n1122 Superiority \n1133   A class action is preferable and superior to other available methods for the \n1144 fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.  Class treatment will permit the \n1155 adjudication of claims by many Class members who could not afford to individually \n1166 litigate their claims or vindicate their rights against the government.  There are no \n1177 difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of this case that might preclude \n1188 its maintenance as a class action, and no superior alternative exists for the fair and \n1199 efficient adjudication of this matter. \n2200 COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2211 Plaintiffs allege the following common facts on information and belief. \n2222 San Diego’s Lack of Affordable Housing Has Created a Homelessness Crisis \n2233   San Diego now has the fourth largest homeless population in the country.  \n2244 (The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, DEPT. OF HOUSING AND \n2255 URBAN  DEV.  29  (Nov.  2016),  https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/\n2266 2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf.)  Based on a January 2017 survey, the Regional Task Force \n2277 on the Homeless found that there are 5,619 homeless people in the City of San Diego, \n2288 an increase of 10% since 2016.  (2017 We All Count Results, supra at 16.)  The \n  16 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.19     Page 19 of\n44\n \n11 Regional Task Force further found that 3,231 of these 5,619 homeless individuals are \n22 unsheltered and living in places not meant for human habitation, an 18% increase from \n33 the previous year.  According to the same survey, San Diego County now has a \n44 homeless population of 9,116, more than double the approximately 4,000 shelter beds \n55 available in the County.  The results of this crisis have been seen in the rapidly \n66 expanding tent encampments in downtown San Diego that have more than doubled in \n77 size in the past year.  \n88   The homelessness crisis in San Diego is directly linked to the lack of \n99 affordable housing.  As of 2014, the median cost of an efficiency studio apartment in \n1100 San Diego was 110% of the amount of an SSI check, which is less than $900/month.  \n1111 (Emily  Cooper  et  al.,  Priced  Out  in  2014:  The  Housing  Crisis  for  People  with \n1122 Disabilities, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COLLABORATIVE (June 2015), http://www.tacinc.\n1133 org/media/52012/Priced%20Out%20in%202014.pdf.)    Since  then,  rents  have \n1144 continued to rise.  The San Diego Housing Federation found that there is a shortfall of \n1155 135,749 homes affordable to low income San Diegans, with rents up 32% in the last \n1166 decade.  Average rent and utilities for a two-bedroom apartment has climbed to $1618 \n1177 a month.  (Stephen Russell, The Affordable Housing Crisis in San Diego: How Do We \n1188 Meet the Need?, SAN DIEGO HOUSING FEDERATION (January 25, 2017), http://docs.\n1199 sandiego.gov/councilcomm_agendas_attach/2017/sglu_170125_4c.pdf.)  In addition, \n2200 the demand for housing subsidies far exceeds the supply.  There is a 10 to 12 year \n2211 waiting list for a Section 8 housing voucher, with over 60,000 persons on the waiting \n2222 list.  The small amount of existing affordable or subsidized housing also has long \n2233 waiting lists. \n2244   The  Regional  Task  Force  on  Homelessness  found  that  the  homeless \n2255 population in the City of San Diego included 817 people living in vehicles.  (2017 We \n2266 All Count Results, supra at 16.)  These individuals have no shelter available to them \n2277 other than in their vehicles.  RV owners without physical addresses have no legal place \n2288 to park their RVs at night.  The few “safe lots” established in San Diego only serve a \n  17 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.20     Page 20 of\n44\n \n11 small portion of people with vehicles who are homeless, prioritize families with small \n22 children, and exclude RVs.   \n33   RV parks in San Diego charge high rents.  Monthly rentals in RV parks in \n44 the City of San Diego range from a low of $699 per month to a high of $1950 per \n55 month depending on the park and the time of year, which is unaffordable to Plaintiffs \n66 and Class members.  Moreover, many RV parks have maximum stay limits and limit \n77 or exclude older RVs. \n88 People with Disabilities Have Been Severely and Disproportionately  \n99 Harmed by the Crisis \n1100   There is also a strong link between homelessness and disability.  The U.S. \n1111 Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  defines  “chronically \n1122 homeless” as an individual with a disability who has been homeless continuously for \n1133 at least 12 months or on at least four separate occasions in the last three years.  24 \n1144 C.F.R. § 91.5(1).  A person is deemed homeless if he or she lacks a fixed, regular, and \n1155 adequate nighttime residence.  This includes persons who use RVs or other vehicles \n1166 for other than temporary living quarters for recreational use.  42 U.S.C. § 11302(a)(1); \n1177 24 C.F.R. § 3282.8(g).  The Regional Task Force found that 31% of the City’s homeless \n1188 population was “chronically homeless.”  (2017 We All Count Results, supra at 16.) \n1199   In San Diego, a high number of homeless individuals have disabilities.  \n2200 The Regional Task Force found that 39% of homeless people in San Diego reported \n2211 mental health disabilities and 40% reported a physical disability.  Some surveys have \n2222 found even higher rates of disability.  For example, of the 1,145 persons attending a \n2233 one-day resource fair for the homeless in the City, 60.2% reported a long lasting \n2244 medical condition and 49.5% reported having a mental illness.  San Diego Housing \n2255 Commission, Project Homeless Connection Report, April 15, 2015.(Project Homeless \n2266 Connect  Report,  SAN  DIEGO  HOUSING  COMMISSION  (April  15,  2015),  http://\n2277 www.sdhc.org/uploadedFiles/Housing_Innovations/Project_Homeless_Connect/\n2288 2015Project%20Homeless%20Connect%20Report_04.15.15.pdf.) \n  18 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.21     Page 21 of\n44\n \n11   The  primary  reason  for  the  strong  link  between  disability  and \n22 homelessness is an economic one.  Homeless individuals with disabilities are not \n33 normally  homeless  as  a  matter  of  choice.    Rather,  many  people  with  disabilities \n44 including  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  are  unable  to  work  due  to  their \n55 disabilities and therefore must rely on a rapidly shrinking social safety net that has not \n66 kept up with rising San Diego rents.   \n77   Living on the streets is dangerous, especially for women, seniors, and \n88 people with disabilities.  In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, 117 homeless \n99 people died on the streets of San Diego, double the figure from two years ago.  Daniel \n1100 Wheaton, Homeless Deaths Have Doubled Over Two Years, SAN DIEGO UNION TRIB. \n1111 (Nov. 28, 2016 2:00 PM), http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/data-watch/sd-\n1122 me-homeless-deaths-20161128-story.html.)  Homeless adults age 50 and older also \n1133 have rates of chronic illness and geriatric conditions similar to or higher than those of \n1144 adults living in housing that are 15 to 20 years older.  Jennifer Goldberg, et al., “How \n1155 to Prevent and End Homelessness Among Older Adults.”  (Jennifer Goldberg et al., \n1166 How to Prevent and End Homelessness Among Older Adults, JUSTICE IN AGING (April \n1177 2016),  http://www.justiceinaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Homelessness-\n1188 Older-Adults.pdf.) \n1199   The City’s current Hepatitis A epidemic highlights the health dangers, \n2200 both to homeless individuals and to others, associated with living on the streets without \n2211 access to shelter and sanitation.  The Hepatitis A outbreak has already resulted in at \n2222 least twenty deaths.  \n2233 Plaintiffs and Class Members Have No Reasonable Option for Shelter Other \n2244 Than Their RVs or Other Vehicles  \n2255   Sheltering oneself is not voluntary conduct.  It is a basic human need.  It \n2266 is harmless.  And it is an act integral to the status of homelessness.  For Named \n2277 Plaintiffs and Class members fortunate enough to have RVs or other vehicles, their \n2288 only reasonable option is to utilize the rudimentary shelter provided by their vehicles \n  19 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.22     Page 22 of\n44\n \n11 until permanent, accessible, and medically appropriate housing that they can afford, \n22 becomes available. \n33   Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  do  not  have  any  reasonably \n44 accessible places in the City to seek shelter in their vehicles or to park their RVs legally \n55 at night.  As explained above, RV parks in San Diego are generally unaffordable to \n66 Plaintiffs and Class members.  Dreams of Change operates a “Safe Parking Program,” \n77 which provides a few places to park vehicles at night.  As of mid-October 2017, \n88 Dreams of Changes operates three such lots in the City.  However, there are currently \n99 only 150 parking spaces available, a fraction of the number of unsheltered homeless \n1100 people with vehicles.  The Program has frequently had long waiting lists for admission.  \n1111 RVs are not accepted.  In the absence of permanent housing options, all participants \n1122 are required to sign up for so-called transitional housing programs that provide only \n1133 temporary  or  short-term  shelter,  and  are  often  inaccessible  and/or  medically \n1144 unacceptable to Plaintiffs and to Disability Subclass members. \n1155   There is also an insufficient number of temporary shelter beds available \n1166 in the City as compared to the unsheltered homeless population forced to seek shelter \n1177 in their vehicles.  There are hundreds more unsheltered homeless people forced to seek \n1188 shelter in their vehicles than available emergency shelter beds, even when accounting \n1199 for seasonal and overflow spaces. \n2200   Even  if  a  homeless  person  is  able  to  identify  an  available  bed  in  a \n2211 temporary or emergency shelter, the shelter bed may be functionally unavailable to that \n2222 person.  Emergency and temporary shelter beds and transitional housing programs are \n2233 functionally  unavailable  to  people  with  disabilities  because  those  types  of  living \n2244 arrangements are likely to aggravate their mental health and/or physical conditions.  \n2255 Many shelters and transitional housing programs in San Diego have an overcrowded \n2266 congregate living environment, are noisy, have a complete lack of privacy, often lack \n2277 opportunity to lie down during the day, present an increased risk of infection, may have \n \n2288 strong odors from smoke and chemical cleaning products that can aggravate respiratory \n  20 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.23     Page 23 of\n44\n \n11 disabilities, and present the risk of criminal activity.  In addition, many shelters only \n \n22 take single people, thereby separating family members and causing additional trauma.  \n33   Temporary  and  emergency  shelters  and  most  transitional  housing \n44 programs also do not provide a real solution for Named Plaintiffs or Class members.  \n55 Even if they were to enter a temporary or emergency shelter or be admitted into a \n66 transitional housing program, Named Plaintiffs and Class members with RVs would \n77 still not have anywhere to park their RVs legally at night and would continue to be at \n88 risk of ticketing under the nighttime RV parking ordinance.  Moreover, because the \n99 shelter  provided  is only  temporary  with  strict  time  limits,  and  in  the  absence  of \n1100 permanent affordable housing alternatives, even individuals who are able to use the \n1111 shelter system are often condemned to spending at least some time on the streets, with \n1122 all the associated health and safety risks.   \n1133   Thus, under current conditions, there are no reasonable alternatives for \n1144 Named Plaintiffs and Class members other than utilizing their RVs or other vehicles. \n1155 City Ordinances Punish Homeless Individuals with Vehicles \n1166   The City’s “Prohibition of Use of Streets for Storage, Service or Sale of \n1177 Vehicles or For Habitation” ordinance, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0137(f), provides: \n1188 “It is unlawful for any person to use a vehicle while it is parked or standing on any \n1199 streets as either temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation.”  \n2200 The terms “temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation” are \n2211 not defined.  A ticket for vehicle habitation is punishable as an infraction by a fine of \n2222 $40 plus a $12.50 surcharge and doubles if not paid in 21 days.  \n2233   The City’s “Prohibition of Parking of Oversized, Non-Motorized and \n2244 Recreational Vehicles” ordinance, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0139(a), provides in \n2255 relevant part: “Except as provided in section 86.0140 or otherwise expressly provided \n2266 to the contrary herein, or unless such parking or standing is authorized by the City \n2277 Manager and appropriate sign permitting such parking or standing are posted: (a) it is \n2288 unlawful for any person to park or leave standing upon any public street, park road or \n  21 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.24     Page 24 of\n44\n \n11 park parking lot, any oversized, non-motorized or recreational vehicle between the \n22 hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.”  A ticket for nighttime RV parking is punishable as \n33 an infraction by a fine of $100 plus a $12.50 surcharge and doubles if not paid in 21 \n44 days. \n55   In addition to fines, there is the potential for other serious consequences \n66 for violating either of these ordinances.  A vehicle can be removed or impounded by \n77 the City when it has five or more unpaid parking violations.  Cal. Veh. Code § 22651.  \n88 In addition, the City may notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the \n99 DMV will not renew the registration until the penalties are paid.  Cal. Veh. Code \n1100 §§ 4760 and 40229(a). \n1111   Though it has made no exceptions to either of these ordinances on the \n1122 basis of homelessness or disability, the City has created an exception to its nighttime \n1133 RV parking ordinance via a permit process that allows for temporary overnight parking \n1144 of RVs on public streets for a cumulative total of up to 72 days in a given year.  San \n1155 Diego Muni. Code § 86.0143.  Such permits are only available for people with physical \n1166 addresses, thereby excluding the persons who live in their vehicles, including Named \n1177 Plaintiffs and Class members.  Id.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members are therefore \n1188 left with no options anywhere in the City to park their RVs at night whether or not they \n1199 are able to access a shelter bed. \n2200   On information and belief, the City enacted the nighttime RV parking \n2211 ordinance in 2013 for the primary purpose of removing homeless RV owners from the \n2222 community.  The City enacted the ordinance in large part due to the difficulty the City \n2233 was having proving that such homeless persons are in violation of the existing vehicle \n2244 habitation ordinance, and due to problems the City had experienced enforcing the \n2255 ordinance prohibiting parking a vehicle in excess of 72 consecutive hours.  San Diego \n2266 Muni. Code § 86.0118. \n2277   The Report from the City Council’s Land Use & Housing Committee in \n2288 support  of  the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance  declared  that  “in  many  cases  an \n  22 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.25     Page 25 of\n44\n \n11 occupant  is  living  illegally  in  vehicle”  and  “current  enforcement  tools  are  time \n22 consuming  and  unproductive  (e.g.  marking  tires,  knocking  on  vehicle  doors).”  \n33 (Neighborhood  Parking  Protection  and  Public  Safety  Ordinance,  LAND  USE  & \n44 HOUSING  COMMITTEE  (March  27,  2013),  http://docs.sandiego.gov/\n55 councilcomm_agendas_attach/2013/LUH_130327_4ppt.pdf.)      At  a  subsequent \n66 Mission Beach Town Council meeting, Julio DeGuzman from the San Diego City \n77 Attorney’s  office  responded  to  complaints  regarding  an  increasing  number  of \n88 “transients” with RVs, by reassuring the attendees that his office “works on removing \n99 the  homeless  from  our  community.”    (Minutes  of  General  Membership  Meeting, \n1100 MISSION BEACH TOWN COUNCIL (Nov. 13, 2013), http://www.missionbeachtc.com/\n1111 uploads/5/0/0/3/50033147/mbtc_minutes_general_mtg_nov.13.2013.pdf.) \n1122   Defendants  have  had  and  continue  to  have  a  policy  and  practice  of \n1133 utilizing these ordinances to issue and/or threaten to issue parking tickets to homeless \n1144 vehicle owners, including to individuals with disability placards or special disabled \n1155 license plates issued by the State of California prominently displayed on their vehicles, \n1166 to impose exorbitant penalties, and to impound their vehicles for failure to pay the \n1177 penalties.    Defendants  have  carried  out  this  policy  even  though  they  knew  or \n1188 reasonably should have known that the majority of the “transients” being targeted for \n1199 ticketing have a disability and/or have no other reasonable option for shelter besides \n2200 their vehicles.  San Diego police officers and other agents and employees of Defendants \n2211 knew or reasonably should have known that many of the individuals receiving these \n2222 tickets have disabilities due to the fact that disability placards are commonly displayed \n2233 on the vehicles; and even in the absence of a disability placard, the officers may have \n2244 had an opportunity to observe or interact with the persons being ticketed, who either \n2255 had an obvious disability or voluntarily disclosed the disability to the officer. \n2266   State  law  considers  a  person  guilty  of  Disorderly  Conduct,  a \n2277 misdemeanor,  if  the  person  “lodges  in  any  building,  structure,  vehicle,  or  place, \n2288 whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to the \n  23 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.26     Page 26 of\n44\n \n11 possession or in control of it.”  Cal. Penal Code § 647(e).  Violation of the statute \n22 carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine.  The language of the \n33 statute makes clear that the City has the authority to grant permission to persons \n44 lodging in vehicles to stay on public property and therefore such arrests or threats of \n55 arrest are purely discretionary. \n66 The City Has Refused to Modify Its Discriminatory Policies \n77   On March 30, 2017, seven of the Plaintiffs—Michael Bloom, Stephen \n88 Chatzky, Valerie Grischy, Penny Helms, Doug Higgins, Suzonne Keith, and David \n99 Wilson—acting through their attorneys, delivered to the office of the City Attorney a \n1100 written request for a reasonable modification of the City’s ticketing policies pursuant \n1111 to the provisions of Title II of the ADA.  The reasonable modification would allow \n1122 them and other homeless RV owners with disabilities to continue to live in San Diego \n1133 and fully utilize their RVs, including at night without ticketing and harassment.  The \n1144 request included supporting evidence documenting each of the individual’s disability-\n1155 related need to utilize their RVs.   \n1166   Plaintiffs are aware of multiple parking lots under City control that are \n1177 empty at night, and that could be used by Named Plaintiffs and Class members for \n1188 nighttime parking of their RVs.  The use of these lots would not infringe on residential \n1199 parking or otherwise inconvenience other City residents. \n2200   In  response  to  Plaintiffs’  reasonable  modification  request,  the  City \n2211 Attorney’s office held one meeting with Plaintiffs’ counsel on May 9, 2017.  Over the \n2222 next two months, and despite the urgency of this matter to Plaintiffs’ health and safety, \n2233 the City did not take or propose any actions to address Plaintiffs’ concerns.  The City, \n2244 while claiming an interest in seeking a resolution, continued to ticket homeless RV \n2255 owners and to impound their vehicles including those with disabilities.  The City’s \n2266 actions showed an unwillingness to make reasonable modifications to its nighttime RV \n2277 parking and vehicle habitation ordinances. \n2288   On  July  8,  2017,  Plaintiffs  requested  that  the  City  temporarily  halt \n  24 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.27     Page 27 of\n44\n \n11 enforcement of San Diego Muni. Code §§ 86.0139(a) and 86.0137(f) to stop ticketing \n22 homeless RV owners and impounding their RV’s pending a final resolution of the \n33 matter.  The City again stalled, waiting until August 23, 2017, before telling Plaintiffs \n44 that it would not agree to halt enforcement of these ordinances temporarily.  Because \n55 of the continued harm being caused to Named Plaintiffs and Class members, Plaintiffs \n66 have no choice now but to file this Complaint. \n77 CLAIMS \n88 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION   \n99 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Reckless Endangerment  \n1100 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n1111   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n1122 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1133   Under the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \n1144 the state deprives a person of a substantive due process right if it affirmatively places \n1155 the person in a position of danger.  Wood v. Ostrander, 875 F. 2d 578, 583 (9th Cir. \n1166 1989). \n1177   Defendants have acted and continue to act affirmatively as described \n1188 herein to place Plaintiffs and Class members in a highly dangerous situation that they \n1199 would not otherwise face, threatening Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ health and safety, \n2200 risking serious exacerbations of their disabilities, and putting their lives at risk. \n2211   Defendants  have  acted  affirmatively  by  citing  Plaintiffs  and  Class \n2222 members for parking and vehicle habitation violations that they cannot reasonably \n2233 avoid, thereby forcing Plaintiffs and Class members to attempt to pay more than they \n2244 can afford on exorbitant fines.  Plaintiffs and Class members who attempt to pay these \n2255 fines must sacrifice paying for life-sustaining food, medication, or other necessities.  \n2266 And when they can no longer afford the fines, they lose the only form of shelter \n2277 available to them—their RV or vehicle—through impoundment.  Without shelter, \n2288 Plaintiffs and Class members face the dangers described herein of living on the streets \n  25 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.28     Page 28 of\n44\n \n11 without shelter. \n22   In the absence of Defendants’ affirmative actions, Plaintiffs and Class \n33 members  would  not  face  these  highly  dangerous  situations.    Plaintiffs  knew  or \n44 reasonably should have known that their actions—up to and including taking away \n55 Defendants’ and Class members’ only form of shelter—would create these threats to \n66 Defendants’ and Class members’ health and safety. \n77   Defendants acted with reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the \n88 dangers—malnourishment,  illness,  and/or  lack  of  shelter—they  were  creating  for \n99 Plaintiffs and Class members by issuing and/or threatening to issue nighttime RV \n1100 parking and vehicle habitation citations and impounding RVs and other vehicles.  \n1111 Defendants also knew or reasonably should have known that the Named Plaintiffs and \n1122 many Class members have disabilities, are chronically homeless, and have no other \n1133 viable options for shelter.  Defendants’ actions show a reckless disregard or deliberate \n1144 indifference to the health, safety and well-being of Plaintiffs and Class members, in \n1155 violation of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ substantive due process rights under the \n1166 Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Wood, 875 F. 2d at 583. \n1177   As a result of Defendants’ actions, Named Plaintiffs’ health and safety \n1188 were placed in grave danger in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Named \n1199 Plaintiffs were injured and damaged in that they were forced to bear the risks and \n2200 medical costs created by these acts.  In addition to that cost, the Named Plaintiffs \n2211 suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because of the danger \n2222 created  by  Defendants’  unlawful  actions.    Defendants’  unlawful  actions  and  the \n2233 resulting  injuries  entitle  Named  Plaintiffs  to  compensatory  damages,  including \n2244 damages for emotional distress. \n2255   An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Class members on the \n2266 one hand, and Defendants on the other, as to whether Defendants have violated and/or \n2277 are imminently threatening to violate 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n2288   Plaintiffs and Class members have no adequate remedy at law for the \n  26 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.29     Page 29 of\n44\n \n11 violations stated herein and are therefore entitled to injunctive, declaratory, and other \n22 equitable relief, including restitution for fines and assessments collected and vehicles \n33 impounded by Defendants.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs. \n44 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n55 Violation of Cruel and Unusual Punishment  \n66 (Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n77   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n88 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n99   The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  provides  that \n1100 “[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and \n1111 unusual punishments inflicted.” \n1122   Defendants’ practice and policy of issuing tickets and threats of tickets for \n1133 nighttime  RV  parking  and  vehicle  habitation  to  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members, \n1144 impounding their RVs and vehicles as a result of those offenses, and threats of arrest \n1155 for  vehicle  habitation  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  on  cruel  and \n1166 unusual punishment because it constitutes a punishment that is disproportionate to the \n1177 severity of the “crime” of violating the nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation \n1188 ordinances or of lodging in one’s vehicle on City streets.  See Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. \n1199 277 (1983). \n2200   The punishments inflicted by Defendants for violation of the ordinances \n2211 in question force Named Plaintiffs and Class members to attempt to pay more than they \n2222 can afford on exorbitant fines.  Plaintiffs and Class members who attempt to pay these \n2233 fines must sacrifice paying for life-sustaining food, medication or other necessities.  \n2244 And when they can no longer afford the fines, they lose the only form of shelter \n2255 available to them—their RV or vehicle—through impoundment.  Without shelter, \n2266 Plaintiffs and Class members face the dangers described herein of living on the streets \n2277 without shelter. \n2288    These  punishments  grossly  outweigh  any  interest  on  the  part  of \n  27 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.30     Page 30 of\n44\n \n11 Defendants in preventing Plaintiffs and Class members from parking on city streets at \n22 certain times of the day and/or seeking shelter in their vehicles. \n33   For  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Disability  Subclass  members,  Defendants’ \n44 practice and policy also violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and \n55 unusual punishment because it punishes Named Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass \n66 members for being homeless.  By punishing the act of sheltering oneself in a vehicle \n77 when there are no other reasonable alternatives, the City effectively punishes the status \n88 of homelessness.  Defendants infringe Plaintiffs’ and Subclass members’ rights by \n99 issuing tickets and threats of tickets for nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation, \n1100 as  well  as  by  impounding  RVs  and  vehicles,  and  threatening  arrest  for  vehicle \n1111 habitation.  See Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962); Jones v. City of Los \n1122 Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated after settlement, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th \n1133 Cir. 2007). \n1144   Named  Plaintiffs  and  Disability  Subclass  members  are  involuntarily \n1155 homeless.  They are homeless because their disabilities led to their unemployment and \n1166 poverty, and because the City lacks affordable housing and accessible, adequate, and \n1177 available shelters.  They cannot reasonably forego sheltering themselves, as sheltering \n1188 oneself is a basic human need.  It is harmless.  And it is an act integral to the status of \n1199 homelessness.  Until permanent, affordable, and accessible housing is available to \n2200 them, their RVs or other vehicles are their only option for meeting their basic human \n2211 need for shelter. \n2222   As a result of Defendants inflicting cruel and unusual punishment under \n2233 color of law in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Named \n2244 Plaintiffs were injured and damaged in that they were forced to pay exorbitant fines \n2255 they could not afford to pay, and/or were deprived of the use of their only available \n2266 shelter—their RVs or other vehicles—and were forced to bear the cost of finding and \n2277 securing whatever other accommodations they could obtain.  In addition to that cost, \n2288 the Named Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation \n  28 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.31     Page 31 of\n44\n \n11 because of this violation of their rights.  Defendants’ unlawful actions and the resulting \n22 injuries entitle Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including damages for \n33 emotional distress.  Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and \n44 declaratory relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n55 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n66 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Void for Vagueness \n77 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n88   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n99 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1100   The Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n1111 U.S. Constitution provides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or \n1122 property, without due process of law.” \n1133   In  order  to  satisfy  the  Due  Process  Clause,  an  ordinance  must  be \n1144 sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and provide \n1155 sufficient guidelines for the police so that arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement \n1166 does not occur.  Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 9 Cal. 4th 1069, 1106-1107 (1995). \n1177   San  Diego’s  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  does  not  satisfy  the \n1188 requirements of the Due Process Clause.  As written, the vehicle habitation ordinance \n1199 makes  unlawful  the  use  of  a  vehicle  parked  or  standing  on  the  street  as  “either \n2200 temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation.”  None of the \n2211 terms used—“temporary living quarters,” “permanent living quarters,” “abode” or \n2222 “place of habitation”—are defined anywhere in the ordinance. \n2233   The City’s vehicle habitation ordinance fails to provide adequate notice \n2244 and sufficient guidance, which would allow an individual to ascertain beyond mere \n2255 speculation as to how one uses a parked or standing vehicle as “either temporary or \n2266 permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation.”  The ordinance therefore fails \n2277 “to draw a clear line between innocent and criminal conduct,” Desertrain v. City of Los \n2288 Angeles, 754 F. 3d 1147, 1156 (9th Cir. 2014), and invites selective enforcement against \n  29 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.32     Page 32 of\n44\n \n11 people who are homeless, many of whom have disabilities.  As detailed above, Named \n22 Plaintiffs and Class members have attempted to comply with the vehicle habitation \n33 ordinance but have nonetheless been ticketed under its vague and overbroad reach. \n44   The  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  should  therefore  be  declared \n55 unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied against Named Plaintiffs and \n66 Class members in violation of substantive due process protections under the Fourteenth \n77 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n88   As a result of the Defendants’ actions under color of law in violation of \n99 the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Named Plaintiffs and Class \n1100 members have been and continue to be forced to pay fines and assessments they cannot \n1111 afford to pay and have been and continue to be deprived of or threatened with the \n1122 deprivation of their only available shelter—their RVs or other vehicles.  In addition to \n1133 that  cost,  Named  Plaintiffs  suffered  emotional  and  mental  distress  as  well  as \n1144 humiliation because of this violation of their rights.  Defendants’ unlawful actions and \n1155 the resulting injuries entitle Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including \n1166 damages for emotional distress.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled \n1177 to injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n1188 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n1199 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Right to Travel  \n2200 (Fourteenth Amendment; Cal. Const. Art. 1, §§ 7 and 24; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n2211   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2222 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n2233   The  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  protects  as  a \n2244 hallmark of personal liberty the right to travel to whatever place one’s own inclination \n2255 may  direct  and  stay  as  long  as  one  wishes.    Enforcement  practices  that  deprive \n2266 individuals of a basic necessity of life may be found to burden the right to travel \n2277 unconstitutionally.  Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974); \n2288 Pottinger v. Miami, 810 F. Supp. 1551 (S.D. Fla. 1992).  “The right to travel has found \n  30 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.33     Page 33 of\n44\n \n11 its strongest expression in the context of attempts by states to discourage the in-\n22 migration of indigents.”  Joyce v. City & Cty. of S.F., 846 F. Supp. 843, 860 (N.D. Cal. \n33 1994).  The California Constitution also specifically protects the right to intrastate \n44 travel.  Cal. Const. Art. 1, §§ 7 and 24; Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 9 Cal. 4th 1069 (Cal. \n55 1995). \n66   Defendants’ pattern and practice of ticketing Named Plaintiffs and Class \n77 members under its nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation ordinances directly \n88 infringes Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Right to Travel.  Defendants have \n99 created  an  RV  parking  permit  process  available  to  most  city  residents  to  allow \n1100 nighttime RV parking, but have denied access to that permitting process to Named \n1111 Plaintiffs  and  Class  members.    Defendants  have  conducted  these  activities  by \n1122 collecting exorbitant fines that Named Plaintiffs cannot afford to pay, impounding their \n1133 vehicles, and threatening criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor, even though Named \n1144 Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  have  no  reasonable  alternative  but  to  utilize  the \n1155 rudimentary shelter provided by their vehicles.  This conduct has the purpose and effect \n1166 of depriving or threatening to deprive Named Plaintiffs and Class members of the \n1177 necessities of life, including food, shelter, and medicine, thereby preventing Named \n1188 Plaintiffs and Class members from travelling to and residing in San Diego. \n1199   Defendants’  enforcement  of  the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance \n2200 specifically leaves Named Plaintiffs and Class members with no options for parking \n2211 their RVs between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM.  Since Named Plaintiffs and Class members \n2222 lack the means to pay for housing or private parking and temporary shelters are not \n2233 available to them, Named Plaintiffs and Class members cannot reasonably be in the \n2244 City within those times, effectively depriving them of all shelter while traveling within \n2255 the City. \n2266   Defendants’  enforcement  of  the  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  also \n2277 infringes Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Right to Travel by preventing them \n2288 from obtaining shelter in the City of San Diego in the only way available to them (in \n  31 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.34     Page 34 of\n44\n \n11 their vehicles), thereby depriving them of that basic necessity in the City.  As described \n22 herein, Named Plaintiffs and Class members lack the means to obtain other shelter or \n33 to pay for private parking for their vehicles in the City, and in the case of Disability \n44 Sub-Class  members,  temporary  and  emergency  shelters  and  transitional  housing \n55 programs  are  not  available  to  them,  because  of  a  lack  of  capacity  and/or  their \n66 disabilities and medical conditions. \n77   Defendants’ actions have violated Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ \n88 Right to Travel under both the Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution \n99 by refusing to provide an exemption to the nighttime RV parking ordinance based on \n1100 homelessness or disability.  The City has provided an exemption to its nighttime RV \n1111 parking ordinance via a permit process that allows people with physical addresses to \n1122 park RVs and oversized vehicles from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM, but has denied the same \n1133 rights  to  those  without  physical  addresses,  including  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class \n1144 members.  Defendants’ enforcement of the nighttime RV parking ordinance against \n1155 Named Plaintiffs and Class members denies them the basic necessity of shelter and \n1166 violates their Constitutional Right to Travel. \n1177   Defendants’ actions therefore unconstitutionally infringe on the Right to \n1188 Travel protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the \n1199 California Constitution. \n2200   As a result of Defendants’ actions under color of law in violation of the \n2211 Right to Travel under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs \n2222 and Class members were forced to pay citations that they could not afford, and/or lost \n2233 their vehicles through impoundment, thereby depriving them of the use of their only \n2244 available  shelter—their  RVs  or  other  vehicles.    In  addition  to  that  cost,  Named \n2255 Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because of this \n2266 violation of their rights.  Defendants’ unlawful actions and the resulting injuries entitle \n2277 Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages including damages for emotional distress.  \n2288 Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n  32 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.35     Page 35 of\n44\n \n11 relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n22 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n33 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Equal Protection  \n44 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n55   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n66 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n77   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment dictates that \n88 no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  \n99 Conduct violates the Equal Protection Clause when it disproportionately affects a \n1100 suspect class or impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 \n1111 U.S. 202, 216-17 (1982). \n1122   Defendants  discriminate  against  homeless  individuals  through  the \n1133 enforcement of the nighttime RV parking ordinance by providing an exemption to the \n1144 prohibition contained in its nighttime RV parking ordinance via a permit process that \n1155 allows people with physical addresses to park RVs and oversized vehicles from 2:00 \n1166 AM to 6:00 AM, but denies the same rights to those without physical addresses, \n1177 including Named Plaintiffs and Class members. \n1188   Defendants’ policies and practices further prevent Named Plaintiffs and \n1199 Class members from obtaining benefits provided by the City by blocking them from \n2200 obtaining a permit exempting them from the nighttime RV parking ordinance.  These \n2211 actions by Defendants have no rational connection to a legitimate government interest.  \n2222 In adopting and implementing these policies and practices as above stated, Defendants \n2233 have thus violated and continue to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United \n2244 States Constitution. \n2255   Defendants’ above-described policies and practices of ticketing homeless \n2266 vehicle owners under its nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation ordinances and \n2277 impounding their RVs or other vehicles serve to single out and discriminate against \n2288 homeless people and/or people with disabilities, including Named Plaintiffs and Class \n  33 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.36     Page 36 of\n44\n \n11 members.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members are being singled out for enforcement \n22 of these ordinances that are not enforced against people with RVs or other vehicles who \n33 do not appear to be homeless or disabled.  Defendants’ selective enforcement of these \n44 ordinances violates Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ right to Equal Protection \n55 under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n66   Defendants’ conduct prevents Named Plaintiffs and Class members from \n77 traveling to the City of San Diego without fear of ticketing and arrest, as detailed in \n88 the  Fourth  Cause  of  Action.    This  restriction  of  the  right  to  travel  infringes  a \n99 fundamental right, is not substantially related to any important government interest, \n1100 and therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n1111   As a result of Defendants’ actions under color of law in violation of the \n1122 Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Named Plaintiffs and Class \n1133 members were forced to pay citations that they could not afford, and/or lost their \n1144 vehicles  through  impoundment,  thereby  depriving  them  of  the  use  of  their  only \n1155 available  shelter—their  RVs  or  other  vehicles.    In  addition  to  that  cost,  Named \n1166 Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because of this \n1177 violation of their rights.  Defendants’ unlawful actions and the resulting injuries entitle \n1188 Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including damages for emotional distress.  \n1199 Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n2200 relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n2211 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n2222 Violation of California Constitution - Due Process and Equal Protection  \n2233 (Cal. Const. art I, § 7) \n2244   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2255 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n2266   Defendants’ policies and practices as herein stated violate the due process \n2277 liberty interests and equal protection provisions of Article I, § 7 of the California \n2288 Constitution. \n  34 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.37     Page 37 of\n44\n \n11 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n22 Violation of Bane Act \n33 (California Civil Code § 52.1 “Bane Act”) \n44   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n55 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n66   California Civil Code § 52.1, also known as the “Bane Act,” provides a \n77 cause of action to individuals whose exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the \n88 United States and/or California Constitutions and other laws has been interfered with, \n99 or attempted to be interfered with, by another’s threat, intimidation, or coercion. \n1100    By  their  conduct  and  actions  as  set  forth  herein,  Defendants  have \n1111 interfered with, have attempted to interfere with, and continue to attempt to interfere \n1122 with, by threat, intimidation, and/or coercion, Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ exercise \n1133 of their rights to be present on the public streets and parking locations in the areas of \n1144 San Diego, as those rights are secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to \n1155 the  United  States  Constitution  and  by  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  State  of \n1166 California, including California Constitution Art. I, § 7, and the federal and state \n1177 statutory protections guaranteed to individuals with disabilities.  Defendants’ actions, \n1188 including citations, arrests, and punishments and the threat thereof, have criminalized \n1199 conduct that is the involuntary result of Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ status, \n2200 in violation of Plaintiffs’ Constitutional rights. \n2211   There  was  and  is  no  lawful  justification  for  Defendants  to  threaten, \n2222 intimidate, or coerce any of the Named Plaintiffs and Class members, or to attempt to \n2233 use threats, intimidation, or coercion as described herein to interfere with Plaintiffs’ \n2244 exercise of their rights.  Defendants’ actions were and are taken willfully and with \n2255 malice and oppression in order to deter and/or prevent Named Plaintiffs and Class \n2266 members from exercising their protected constitutional and statutory rights. \n2277   As a direct and legal result of Defendants’ actions, Named Plaintiffs \n2288 suffered and continue to suffer pain and suffering, humiliation and embarrassment and \n  35 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.38     Page 38 of\n44\n \n11 are entitled to compensatory damages for injury to their persons, loss of property and \n22 health, and a loss of their constitutional rights including all damages authorized by Cal. \n33 Civ. Code § 52, and all other applicable laws including treble damages and punitive \n44 damages against the Defendants, as permitted by law.  Named Plaintiffs and Class \n55 members are further entitled to injunctive relief. \n66 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n77 Violation of Americans with Disabilities Act \n88 (42 U.S.C. § 12132) \n99 (On Behalf of Disability Subclass Members) \n1100   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n1111 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1122   Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, provides that: \n1133 [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \n1144 excluded  from  participation  in  or  be  denied  the  benefits  of  the  services, \n1155 programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by \n1166 any such entity. \n1177   The Named Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass members are “qualified \n1188 persons with disabilities” as defined under the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12102; 42 U.S.C. \n1199 § 12131; 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. \n2200   Under  the  ADA’s  broad  language,  a  “program,  service,  or  activity” \n2211 includes within its scope “anything a public entity does.”  Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep’t \n2222 of Corr., 118 F. 3d 168, 171 & n. 5 (3d Cir. 1997), aff’d 524 U.S. 206 (1998) (quoting \n2233 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A, preamble to ADA regulations). \n2244   The City’s parking program including the enforcement by the Police \n2255 Department of its parking ordinances is a service, program, or activity of the City. \n2266   In addition, the various amenities of City life offered to its residents, \n2277 including San Diego’s parks, beaches and public events are “services, programs, or \n2288 activities” of the City. \n  36 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.39     Page 39 of\n44\n \n11   Title II protects people with disabilities against facially neutral policies \n22 that burden people with disabilities more than others, by requiring that the public entity \n33 provide reasonable modifications to avoid the discrimination unless the public entity \n44 can demonstrate that such modifications would result in a fundamental alteration of the \n55 program.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); Crowder v. Kitagaw, 81 F. 3d 1480 (9th Cir. 1996). \n66   Reasonable modifications can adjust for the financial limitations that arise \n77 from a disability, not just the immediate manifestations of the impairment giving rise \n88 to the disability.  Giebeler v. M & B Associates, 343 F. 3d 1143, 1152 (9th Cir. 2003). \n99   By refusing to reasonably modify their policies and practices as described \n1100 herein to allow Named Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass members to legally park their \n1111 vehicles on City streets or other public property and to utilize their vehicles for shelter, \n1122 at least until affordable, accessible and medically appropriate housing is available for \n1133 them,  Defendants  have  violated  and  continue  to  violate  the  antidiscrimination \n1144 requirements of Title II of the ADA. \n1155   Title II regulations interpreting the ADA prohibit a public entity from \n1166 utilizing  criteria  or  methods  of  administration  that  have  the  effect  of  subjecting \n1177 qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination based on disability.  29 C.F.R. \n1188 § 35.130(b)(3). \n1199   A public entity is also prohibited from imposing eligibility criteria that \n2200 screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities from fully and equally \n2211 enjoying any service, program, or activity.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8). \n2222   Defendants’ policies and practices in administrating their parking program \n2233 through  ticketing  Disability  Subclass  members,  impounding  their  RVs  and  other \n2244 vehicles and excluding homeless RV owners from the ability to obtain parking permits \n2255 available to people with physical addresses, has the effect of discriminating against and \n2266 imposing disproportionate burdens on people with disabilities based on disability, \n2277 screening out such persons from the benefits of the City’s parking program, and \n2288 denying them meaningful access to such benefits and to the City’s amenities enjoyed \n  37 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.40     Page 40 of\n44\n \n11 by and available to people without disabilities. \n22   In carrying out Defendants’ policies and practices as described herein, \n33 Defendants have utilized criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \n44 subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination based on disability.  \n55 29 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n66   In carrying out Defendants’ policies and practices as herein described and \n77 denying Plaintiffs’ request for reasonable modification in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights \n88 under the ADA, Defendants have acted knowingly and with deliberate indifference to \n99 the harm substantially likely to occur. \n1100   As a result of Defendants’ unlawful acts, Named Plaintiffs have suffered \n1111 and  continue  to  suffer  injuries,  including  emotional  injuries,  and  are  entitled  to \n1122 compensatory damages, including damages for emotional distress.  In addition, Named \n1133 Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass members are entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n1144 relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n1155 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n1166 Violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973  \n1177 (29 U.S.C. § 794) \n1188 (On Behalf of Disability Subclass Members) \n1199   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2200 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n2211   Defendants City of San Diego and the San Diego Police Department are \n2222 recipients of financial assistance from the federal government. \n2233   Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that qualified \n2244 persons  with  disabilities  be  provided  with  meaningful  access  to  federally  funded \n2255 programs.  In order to assure meaningful access, reasonable modifications may be \n2266 required  unless  the  recipient  of  federal  funding  can  demonstrate  that  such \n2277 modifications would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.  29 \n2288 U.S.C. § 749; 24 C.F.R. §§ 8.3 and 8.4; Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985). \n  38 Case No.   \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 1     Filed 11/15/17     PageID.41     Page 41 of\n44\n \n11   Defendants’ actions and omissions as herein stated have denied Plaintiffs’ \n22 and Disability Subclass members’ right to reasonable modifications thereby denying \n33 them meaningful access to Defendants’ parking program and to the amenities that the \n44 City offers its residents without disabilities, and subjecting them to discrimination on \n55 the basis of disability, in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n66   As a result of Defendants’ unlawful acts in violation of the Rehabilitation \n77 Act,  Named  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  continue  to  suffer  injuries,  including \n88 emotional injuries, and are entitled to compensatory damages, including damages for \n99 emotional distress.  In addition, Named Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass members are \n1100 entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n1111 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n1122   WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n1133 A.

Declare that Defendants’ past, present and threatened future enforcement \n2200 of the above San Diego ordinances and threats of arrest for lodging in vehicles on \n2211 public  property  against  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Disability  Subclass  members \n2222 discriminates on the basis of disability in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \n2233 the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; \n2244 C.  Declare that San Diego’s vehicle habitation ordinance, San Diego Muni. \n2255 Code § 86.0137(a), is void for vagueness and unenforceable facially and/or as applied \n2266 to Named Plaintiffs and Class members pursuant to the due process protections of the \n2277 U.S. and California Constitutions; \n2288 D.

There are at least \n66 817 unsheltered homeless residents in San Diego, many with disabilities, who seek \n77 shelter in their recreational vehicles (“RVs”), campers, or other vehicles.  For these \n88 people, their vehicles are their only reliable, safe shelter from the elements and only \n99 place to store their belongings.  Yet, even though there are no adequate alternatives, the \n1100 City has repeatedly ticketed and harassed these individuals for seeking shelter in their \n1111 vehicles or simply for owning vehicles and having nowhere else to park.  Specifically, \n1122 the City has used its ordinance prohibiting RV parking from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM, San \n1133 Diego  Muni.  Code  § 86.0139(a)  (“the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance”),  and  its \n1144 ordinance prohibiting vehicle habitation, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0137(f) (“the \n1155 vehicle habitation ordinance”), to target homeless vehicle owners, ticketing them and \n1166 impounding their vehicles for unpaid tickets.  In addition, the City has threatened \n1177 homeless vehicle owners with arrest and misdemeanor charges for illegal lodging. \n1188   Even after being alerted to these issues, the City has refused to modify its \n1199 policies to provide an opportunity for homeless individuals to park their vehicles \n2200 legally on City streets or other public property, at least until affordable, accessible, and \n2211 medically appropriate housing is made available to them.  While failing to provide any \n2222 accommodation for homeless individuals, including those with disabilities, the City \n2233 has created an exemption to the nighttime RV parking ordinance, via a permit system, \n2244 for persons who have a physical address.  In other words, under certain circumstances, \n2255 the City allows people who are not homeless to park their RVs overnight but imposes \n2266 penalties against those who are homeless for the same behavior. \n2277   The  City  has  carried  out  this  discriminatory,  cruel,  punitive,  and \n2288 unconstitutional  policy  against  homeless  vehicle  owners,  many  of  whom  have \n  1 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.90     Page 4 of\n48\n \n11 disabilities, despite the fact that these individuals have nowhere else to go.  Sky-high \n22 rents and extremely low incomes, among other factors, have excluded these City \n33 residents  from  the  housing  market.    RV  parks  are  often  as  costly  as  renting  an \n44 apartment, and so are not viable options.  “Safe lots” that allow overnight parking for \n55 homeless individuals do not accept RVs and have far fewer spaces than the number of \n66 homeless persons with vehicles in San Diego.  The number of unsheltered homeless \n77 people far outnumbers available emergency shelter beds, which are generally filled and \n88 cannot accommodate the hundreds of people who are forced to seek shelter in their \n99 vehicles.    At  best,  emergency  and  temporary  shelters  provide  only  transitory \n1100 accommodations, with a large majority who are exited from shelters still lacking the \n1111 permanent housing that they need.  Moreover, emergency and temporary shelter beds \n1122 are functionally unavailable to many homeless people with disabilities because the \n1133 conditions  in  the  shelter  environment  are  not  medically  acceptable  given  those \n1144 disabilities.  Homeless vehicle owners therefore do not have either a place to seek \n1155 shelter in their vehicles legally in the City or the availability of adequate, accessible, \n1166 stable and medically appropriate housing that they can afford.  In addition, homeless \n1177 vehicle owners have no funds with which to pay the excessive fines associated with \n1188 the nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation citations without jeopardizing their \n1199 ability to buy food, medicine, or other necessities.  As a result, homeless vehicle \n2200 owners have had and are at risk of having their only shelter taken away by the City for \n2211 unpaid tickets. \n2222   The nighttime RV parking ordinance and vehicle habitation ordinance \n2233 both  violate  numerous  U.S.  and  State  Constitutional  rights,  including  the  Eighth \n2244 Amendment  prohibition  on  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment  and  Fourteenth \n2255 Amendment  Due  Process  protections,  including  the  prohibition  on  state-created \n2266 danger; the Right to Equal Protection; and the Right to Travel.  The vehicle habitation \n2277 ordinance is also so vague and ambiguously worded that neither homeless individuals \n2288 nor anyone else can ascertain what is or is not prohibited or how to comply with the \n  2 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.91     Page 5 of\n48\n \n11 ordinance to avoid receiving a ticket or having their vehicle impounded.  In addition, \n22 enforcement of the ordinances discriminates against homeless vehicle owners based on \n33 disability in violation of the antidiscrimination protections of Title II of the Americans \n44 with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n55   Rather than adequately accommodating this homeless, largely disabled \n66 group of individuals and complying with statutory and constitutional requirements, the \n77 City has instead chosen to place the health, safety, and lives of homeless vehicle owners \n88 in further jeopardy, in the hope that the continuing and escalating harassment will force \n99 these residents simply to leave town. \n1100   Plaintiffs seek a Court order requiring that the City put an end to these \n1111 harmful, discriminatory, and unconstitutional practices against this defenseless group \n1122 of individuals. \n1133 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1144   The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and \n1155 1343, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because Plaintiffs’ claims arise under \n1166 the laws and Constitution of the United States.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, this \n1177 Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law and state constitutional claims \n1188 because Plaintiffs’ state claims are related to Plaintiffs’ federal claims, arise out of a \n1199 common nucleus of operative facts and form part of the same case or controversy under \n2200 Article III of the U.S. Constitution. \n2211   Venue is proper in the Southern District of California because Defendant \n2222 resides in the District and all events given rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the \n2233 District.  The relief Plaintiffs seek is within this Court’s power to grant. \n2244 PARTIES \n2255 A.  Plaintiffs \n2266   Plaintiff MICHAEL BLOOM is 68 years-old and a life-long resident of \n2277 the City of San Diego.  Mr. Bloom previously worked as an electrician and carpenter \n2288 but suffered several accidents that left him with a severely damaged arm and foot, and \n  3 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.92     Page 6 of\n48\n \n11 led to his suffering from hypoglycemia and severe depression.  Because of these \n22 debilitating physical and mental health issues, Mr. Bloom has not been able to engage \n33 in gainful employment since his last accident in 1982.  His sole source of income is \n44 Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  Even if Mr. \n55 Bloom were able to locate an open bed at an emergency or temporary shelter, which \n66 are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of homeless people who \n77 currently seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally unavailable to him \n88 because his physical disabilities require him to lie down frequently during the day and \n99 the overcrowding and lack of privacy would worsen his mental health condition.  As a \n1100 result, for the last ten years, his only available shelter has been his RV.  Mr. Bloom is \n1111 not able to park his RV in the existing City “safe lots” because the “safe lots” do not \n1122 allow RVs.  Despite this, and even though he has a disability placard on his vehicle, \n1133 Mr. Bloom has received at least a dozen tickets for parking his RV at night on city \n1144 streets, about five tickets for vehicle habitation, and has been threatened with arrest for \n1155 vehicle habitation.  As one example, he received a ticket on or about December 12, \n1166 2017 for violation of the nighttime RV parking ordinance.  When he has paid these \n1177 tickets, Mr. Bloom has not had enough money to pay for food or gasoline.  If Mr. Bloom \n1188 does not pay the tickets, however, the City may impound his RV, which would be \n1199 devastating for his mental and physical health and put him at far greater physical risk.  \n2200 It would also leave Mr. Bloom without the only form of shelter available to him.  Mr. \n2211 Bloom meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations \n2222 issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  24 C.F.R. \n2233 § 91.5(1).  Mr. Bloom is also a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning \n2244 of  the  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  § 12102,  and  the \n2255 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 706(8). \n2266   Plaintiff STEPHEN CHATZKY is 70 years old and resides in the City of \n2277 San Diego with his domestic partner, Suzonne Keith, and her disabled adult daughter.  \n2288 Mr. Chatzky is a lawyer, but his Attention Deficit Disorder and memory problems have \n  4 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.93     Page 7 of\n48\n \n11 made it difficult for him practice law.  As a result, since 2002, his sole source of income \n22 has been Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  \n33 Even if Mr. Chatzky were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or emergency \n44 shelter, which are generally filled and cannot accommodate the hundreds of homeless \n55 people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally unavailable to \n66 him because shelter conditions would force the family to separate.  A psychologist who \n77 evaluated Mr. Chatzky opined that if Mr. Chatzky were separated from his family, it \n88 would worsen his mental health condition.  Additionally, Mr. Chatzky has asthma and \n99 sleep apnea and is prone to lung infections.  Shelters typically reek of tobacco smoke, \n1100 which make it difficult for him to breathe and put him at risk for lung infections.  \n1111 Because  of  these  circumstances,  the  family  has  lived  in  an  RV  since  2008.    In \n1122 approximately June of 2015, the City of San Diego impounded the family’s first RV \n1133 for failure to pay tickets, including tickets for nighttime RV parking and vehicle \n1144 habitation, even though the family had a disability placard on the vehicle at that time.  \n1155 After the impoundment, the family had no regular shelter, and they were forced to sleep \n1166 cramped in a car for five months until they were able to obtain another RV through a \n1177 family member’s assistance.  Because Mr. Chatzky and Ms. Keith live in an RV, they \n1188 are unable to utilize existing City “safe lots” because “safe lots” do not accept RVs.  As \n1199 a result, despite making every effort to avoid the ticketing, Mr. Chatzky and Ms. Keith \n2200 continue to receive tickets for parking their RV at night, as recently as February 13, \n2211 2018.  Mr. Chatzky meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by HUD \n2222 regulations and is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning of the \n2233 ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n2244   Plaintiff SUZONNE KEITH is 68 years old and a resident of the City of \n2255 San Diego.  Ms. Keith has held a range of government jobs, including as an equal rights \n2266 investigator, but her disabilities have made her unable to engage in gainful employment \n2277 for the last 19 years.  She has severe arthritis and edema that interfere with her ability \n2288 to stand or walk, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) from \n  5 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.94     Page 8 of\n48\n \n11 having survived domestic violence prior to meeting Mr. Chatzky, and debilitating \n22 migraines.  Ms. Keith’s sole source of income is a pension of $400 per month, and she \n33 cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  As a result, Ms. Keith’s only option for shelter \n44 has been to live in an RV with Mr. Chatzky and her daughter.  After the couple’s first \n55 RV was impounded for not paying parking tickets, the couple slept cramped in a car \n66 for five months.  Because the police continue to ticket the couple, Ms. Keith is terrified \n77 that the City will also impound their second RV, which is the only form of shelter \n88 available to her.  Even if Ms. Keith were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n99 emergency shelter, which are generally filled and cannot accommodate the hundreds \n1100 of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n1111 unavailable to her because it would require that Ms. Keith be separated from Mr. \n1122 Chatzky and her adult daughter, triggering her trauma symptoms and worsening her \n1133 depression.  Additionally, the conditions of shelters, including the high noise level, \n1144 triggers migraines for Ms. Keith.  When Ms. Keith is suffering from a debilitating \n1155 migraine, she needs to rest in a private and dark space, which is usually not available \n1166 at shelters.  Ms. Keith is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning of \n1177 the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and meets the definition of “chronically homeless” \n1188 as defined by the HUD regulations. \n1199   Plaintiff TONY DIAZ is 58 years old and a resident of the City of San \n2200 Diego.  Mr. Diaz worked as a welder until 2011, when worsening pain and other \n2211 symptoms of his anxiety disorder, diabetes, hypertension, severe respiratory problems, \n2222 and bad knee and shoulder prevented him from working.  He also recently had major \n2233 heart surgery.  Mr. Diaz has been homeless for approximately five years and owns a \n2244 pick-up  truck  with  a  shell  that  serves  as  his  only  shelter  and  place  to  keep  his \n2255 belongings.  He has no regular income, and he cannot afford market rents in San Diego.  \n2266 Mr. Diaz has received four vehicle habitation tickets, even though he spends nights \n2277 parked at a local 7-Eleven store with the permission of the manager and does not sleep \n2288 in his vehicle when it is parked on City property.  On August 25, 2016 at approximately \n  6 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.95     Page 9 of\n48\n \n11 6:30 a.m., Mr. Diaz came out of a bathroom in a public park when a member of the San \n22 Diego Police Department issued him a vehicle habitation ticket.  Mr. Diaz explained to \n33 the officer that he had just arrived to go fishing and told the officer that he was disabled \n44 and had just had heart surgery.  The officer nonetheless issued the ticket and threatened \n55 to ticket him anytime he saw Mr. Diaz’s vehicle.  The officer also threatened to have \n66 Mr. Diaz arrested for vehicle habitation.  Since that incident, police officers have \n77 continued to harass and ticket Mr. Diaz under the vehicle habitation ordinance.  As one \n88 example, Mr. Diaz received a ticket for violation of the vehicle habitation ordinance \n99 on or about December 23, 2017.  Mr. Diaz has done his best to comply with the vehicle \n1100 habitation  ordinance  by  parking  overnight  on  private  property  with  the  owner’s \n1111 permission but does not understand what he needs to do in order to stop the ticketing.  \n1122 Even if Mr. Diaz were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or emergency shelter, \n1133 which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of homeless people \n1144 forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally unavailable to him \n1155 because the tobacco smoke, cleaning fluid odors, and lack of fresh air would aggravate \n1166 his respiratory condition.  Moreover, the crowded, noisy, and regimented environment \n1177 of shelters would worsen his symptoms of anxiety.  Mr. Diaz is a qualified individual \n1188 with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  He also \n1199 meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n2200   Plaintiff VALERIE GRISCHY is 59 years old and a resident of the City \n2211 of San Diego.  Ms. Grischy was a licensed chiropractor and had a successful career, \n2222 until she became disabled by a serious car accident in 2009.  Since shortly after the \n2233 accident, she has been unable to work due to severe back pain, depression, anxiety, and \n2244 panic attacks stemming from a traumatic brain injury and PTSD.  Ms. Grischy’s sole \n2255 source of income is Supplementary Security Income (SSI), and she cannot afford \n2266 market rents in San Diego.  Because she has not been able to afford housing, Ms. \n2277 Grischy has been living in her RV since 2012.  She has received tickets from the City \n2288 of San Diego for vehicle habitation and nighttime RV parking even though she has a \n  7 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.96     Page 10\nof 48\n \n11 disability placard on the vehicle.  Ms. Grischy has tried to find places to park, driving \n22 up to 30 miles a day, in an attempt to avoid being ticketed.  Despite her efforts, Ms. \n33 Grischy has continued to receive written warnings and tickets from police.  As one \n44 example, she received two tickets on or about December 30, 2017, one for violation of \n55 the vehicle habitation ordinance and one for violation of the nighttime RV parking \n66 ordinance.  Paying these parking tickets would be a severe financial hardship for her.  \n77 The threat of ticketing also forced her to leave San Diego temporarily, which she \n88 considers her home, to avoid further ticketing.  Even if Ms. Grischy were able to locate \n99 an open bed at a temporary or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot \n1100 accommodate the hundreds of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, \n1111 it would be functionally unavailable to her because her medical history and medical \n1122 needs require that she live alone.  Communal shelter life is simply untenable.  The \n1133 current City “safe lots” are not an option for Ms. Grischy because RVs are not allowed \n1144 in those lots.  Ms. Grischy is a qualified individual with disabilities within the meaning \n1155 of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  She also meets the definition of “chronically \n1166 homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n1177   Plaintiff PENNY “GRACE” HELMS is 58 years old and a resident of the \n1188 City of San Diego.  Ms. Helms supported herself throughout her 20s working as a \n1199 waiter and dancer.  At the age of 29, the long-term effects of chronic illnesses, and the \n2200 physical and emotional trauma that she experienced as a child, became so debilitating \n2211 that she had to stop working.  Ms. Helms suffers from fibromyalgia; chronic fatigue \n2222 syndrome; arthritis; six bulging disks; hypersensitivity and allergy to environmental \n2233 pollutants such as cigarette smoke and perfume; and various neurological disorders \n2244 including PTSD, hypervigilance, emotional hypersensitivity, and dissociative identity \n2255 disorder.  Over the past two decades, she has tried to earn a living by working as a \n2266 house cleaner, dog groomer, among other jobs, whenever her disabilities permit.  But \n2277 none of that income has been steady or sufficient for her to support herself, and that \n2288 income has only fallen over the years.  Ms. Helms’ main, and often the only, source of \n  8 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.97     Page 11\nof 48\n \n11 income for the past few years has been Social Security disability benefits.  She cannot \n22 afford market rents in San Diego.  Because of this, Ms. Helms had been forced to seek \n33 shelter in her RV.  She has been threatened multiple times by police with ticketing for \n44 vehicle habitation and impoundment for living in her RV, as least as recently as April \n55 2017.  She has also been threatened with arrest for encroachment near her RV.  The \n66 threat of receiving citations she cannot afford to pay, impoundment, and arrest terrifies \n77 her and exacerbates her disabilities, including her hypervigilance.  She has left San \n88 Diego for periods of weeks or months at a time due to her fear of being ticketed, \n99 arrested, and having her RV impounded, even though she considers San Diego her \n1100 home.  Ms. Helms currently does not have a place in San Diego where she can safely \n1111 park or seek shelter in her RV.  Even if Ms. Helms were able to locate an open bed at a \n1122 temporary or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the \n1133 hundreds of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be \n1144 functionally unavailable to her because she cannot tolerate communal living given her \n1155 myriad disabilities.  The current City “safe lots” are not an option for Ms. Helms \n1166 because RVs are not allowed.  Ms. Helms is a qualified individual with disabilities \n1177 within the meaning of the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act.  She also meets the \n1188 definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by HUD regulations. \n1199   Plaintiff BENJAMIN HERNANDEZ is a 54-year-old man and a resident \n2200 of the City of San Diego.  Mr. Hernandez was a stonemason and primary breadwinner \n2211 for his family until he was involved in a pedestrian accident in 2015.  After the accident, \n2222 the orthopedic impairments from his injuries, along with depression, left him unable to \n2233 work.  Mr. Hernandez was only given a small, one-time disability award and does not \n2244 receive ongoing disability benefits.  Though his wife works, her wages are extremely \n2255 modest and insufficient to afford the high cost of housing in San Diego.  Their lack of \n2266 funds has caused Mr. Hernandez and his wife to utilize their RV as their shelter for the \n2277 past year.  In addition to offering shelter from the elements, their RV provided them \n2288 with a shower, toilet, refrigerator, stove and microwave and a queen-sized bed.  On or \n  9 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.98     Page 12\nof 48\n \n11 about July 26, 2017, however, the City impounded their RV for unpaid nighttime RV \n22 parking citations.  Since they could not afford to pay the citations and towing fees in \n33 order to retrieve their RV from impoundment, the couple spent several weeks cramped \n44 in their Toyota Camry which aggravated Mr. Hernandez’s back injury.  The loss of his \n55 RV was also extremely traumatic, causing Mr. Hernandez’s depression to worsen. \n66 Currently, Mr. Hernandez uses an SUV as his only available shelter, and he remains at \n77 risk for vehicle habitation tickets.  Even if Mr. Hernandez were able to locate an open \n88 bed  at  a  temporary  or  emergency  shelter,  which  are  generally  full  and  cannot \n99 accommodate the hundreds of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, \n1100 it would be functionally unavailable to him because it would force him to separate from \n1111 his wife, aggravating the symptoms of his depression.  Mr. Hernandez is a qualified \n1122 individual with disabilities within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, and \n1133 California law.  He also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by \n1144 the regulations issued by HUD. \n1155   Plaintiff DOUG HIGGINS is 68 years old, a resident of the City of San \n1166 Diego, and a veteran who was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army.  He had a \n1177 successful career as a car dealer until his symptoms of anxiety and depression, along \n1188 with a painful back condition, worsened in 2009.  His bad back, which is aggravated \n1199 by stress, keeps him from standing, sitting, or walking for any length of time.  His sole \n2200 source of income is Social Security benefits, and he cannot afford to pay market rent \n2211 in San Diego.  Even if Mr. Higgins were able to locate an open bed at a temporary or \n2222 emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n2233 homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n2244 unavailable to him because it would exacerbate his mental health symptoms.  For the \n2255 past three years, his RV has been the only shelter available to him.  Mr. Higgins has \n2266 received tickets both for vehicle habitation and for nighttime RV parking.  He received \n2277 a nighttime RV parking ticket on or about November 11, 2017 and a habitation ticket \n2288 on or about November 10, 2016.  He cannot afford to pay the tickets; paying them \n  10 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.99     Page 13\nof 48\n \n11 jeopardizes his ability to pay for food and other necessities.  The threat of ticketing and \n22 fear  of  losing  his  RV  to  impoundment  increases  his  stress  and  exacerbates  the \n33 symptoms of his disabilities.  Police have told him to leave the City if he does not like \n44 the ticketing, but he considers San Diego to be his home.  Mr. Higgins is a qualified \n55 individual with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n66 Mr. Higgins also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the \n77 regulations issued by HUD. \n88   Plaintiff DAVID WILSON is 47 years old and a resident of the City of \n99 San Diego.  Mr. Wilson previously worked as an actor, taxi driver, and security guard.  \n1100 Mr.  Wilson  has  a  range  of  conditions  arising  from  a  car  accident,  including \n1111 compression  of  the  spine,  peripheral  neuropathy,  edema  in  both  feet  and  ankles \n1122 (requiring him to elevate his feet), depression, PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder, an \n1133 eating disorder, and porphyria (a skin condition that makes him highly susceptible to \n1144 infection).  Mr. Wilson also suffers from asthma, hypersomnia (a condition in which a \n1155 person has trouble staying awake during the day), and social anxiety.  Because of these \n1166 conditions, Mr. Wilson had to stop working in 1999.  His sole source of income is SSI, \n1177 and he cannot afford to pay market rent in San Diego.  In 2013, Mr. Wilson purchased \n1188 an RV, giving him a place to lie down and take shelter from the elements.  In addition, \n1199 the RV provided him with running water, a stove, a refrigerator and the ability to control \n2200 the temperature in his environment.  Mr. Wilson has received numerous tickets from \n2211 the City of San Diego, including for vehicle habitation and nighttime RV parking, and \n2222 has been threatened with arrest for vehicle habitation.  This happened despite his \n2233 having a disabled placard on the vehicle.  In an attempt to save the little money he had \n2244 to pay the tickets, Mr. Wilson has resorted to eating out of the trash.  Ultimately unable \n2255 to pay all the tickets, Mr. Wilson sold his RV around October of 2015 to avoid imminent \n2266 impoundment and purchased a truck with the proceeds.  Deprived of his RV, he began \n2277 sleeping outside or cramped in the cab of the truck.  Without a proper place to lie down \n2288 and elevate his feet, and forced to sleep outside or in his truck, Mr. Wilson ended up \n  11 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.100     Page 14\nof 48\n \n11 hospitalized  soon  after  he  was  forced  to  sell  his  RV  due  to  imminent  threat  of \n22 impoundment.  The loss of his RV has continued to have negative effects on Mr. \n33 Wilson’s health; however, he has been and continues to be deterred from exchanging \n44 his truck for another RV because of the ongoing enforcement of the nighttime RV \n55 parking ordinance. Even if Mr. Wilson were able to locate an open bed at a temporary \n66 or emergency shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds \n77 of homeless people forced to seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n88 unavailable  to  him  because  the  crowded  and  noisy  shelter  environment  would \n99 aggravate  Mr.  Wilson’s  mental  health  conditions  and,  due  to  his  vulnerability  to \n1100 infection and asthma, put his physical condition at further risk.  Police have also \n1111 continued to issue Mr. Wilson warnings and threatened him with further ticketing for \n1122 vehicle habitation in his truck, which is the only reasonable form of shelter available \n1133 to him.  He received such threats at least as recently as June 2017.  Mr. Wilson is a \n1144 qualified  individual  with  disabilities  within  the  meaning  of  the  ADA  and  the \n1155 Rehabilitation Act.  Mr. Wilson also meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as \n1166 defined by HUD regulations. \n1177   Plaintiff GERALD STARK is 76 years-old, and has lived his entire life in \n1188 the  City  of  San  Diego.    Mr.  Stark  worked  installing  pipes  as  a  member  of  the \n1199 Steamfitters Union until he retired in 2007.  Since retirement, his income consists only \n2200 of Social Security and a small pension totaling $2,000 per month to support himself \n2211 and his wife of twelve years, Anna Stark.  This income is not enough to afford market \n2222 rents in San Diego for himself and his wife.  As a result, Mr. Stark and his wife, Anna, \n2233 moved into an RV in 2008 – one year after his retirement.  Emergency shelter is not an \n2244 option for Mr. Stark. Even if he were able to locate an open bed at an emergency or \n2255 temporary shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n2266 homeless people who currently seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n2277 unavailable to him because it would require him to separate from his wife.  Since 2008, \n2288 Mr. Stark’s home and only available shelter has been inside an RV shared with Ms. \n  12 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.101     Page 15\nof 48\n \n11 Stark.  Mr. Stark is not able to park an RV in the existing City “safe lots” because the \n22 “safe lots” do not allow RVs.  Despite this, Mr. Stark has received tickets for parking \n33 his RV at night on city streets and for vehicle habitation during the last two years.  \n44 Because he was unable to afford to pay those tickets, his RV was impounded by the \n55 City on or about March 28, 2017.  Because the City impounded his home and only \n66 form of shelter, Mr. Stark now lives unsheltered on the streets of the City where he has \n77 suffered and will continue to suffer serious physical, mental, and emotional harm.  Mr. \n88 Stark meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations \n99 issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  24 C.F.R. \n1100 § 91.5(1).   \n1111   Plaintiff ANNA STARK is 48 years-old, and she has lived in the City of \n1122 San Diego for her entire life.  She has been married to Gerald Stark for twelve years.  \n1133 Ms. Stark has severe anxiety stemming from multiple past traumas.  She previously \n1144 worked as a home health care worker, but has been unemployed for many years due to \n1155 her mental health condition.  She has no income, and she is entirely dependent on her \n1166 husband’s small pension and Social Security, which is too low to afford market rents \n1177 in San Diego.  Even if Ms. Stark were able to locate an open bed at an emergency or \n1188 temporary shelter, which are generally full and cannot accommodate the hundreds of \n1199 homeless people who currently seek shelter in their vehicles, it would be functionally \n2200 unavailable to her because it would require her to separate from her husband and her \n2211 support animal and the crowded congregate living environment would aggravate her \n2222 anxiety.  Since 2008, her only available home and shelter has been inside an RV shared \n2233 with Mr. Stark.  Ms. Stark is not able to park an RV in the existing City “safe lots” \n2244 because the “safe lots” do not allow RVs.  Despite this, the RV Ms. Stark uses as a \n2255 home has been ticketed multiple times, including for parking at night on city streets.  \n2266 On or about March 28, 2017, the Starks’ RV was impounded for unpaid tickets.  \n2277 Because the City impounded their home and only form of shelter, Ms. Stark now lives \n2288 unsheltered on the streets of the City where she has suffered and will continue to suffer \n  13 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.102     Page 16\nof 48\n \n11 serious physical, mental, and emotional harm.  Ms. Stark is a qualified individual with \n22 disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Ms. Stark also \n33 meets the definition of “chronically homeless” as defined by the regulations issued by \n44 the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  24 C.F.R. § 91.5(1).  \n55   The term “Named Plaintiffs” or “Plaintiffs” refers to all the individual \n66 Plaintiffs named in this section. \n77 B.  Defendant \n88   Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO is now and, at all times mentioned in \n99 this  Complaint,  was  a  local  government  agency  and  subdivision  of  the  State  of \n1100 California.  Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO, through its agents the Mayor, City \n1111 Council, City Attorney, Parking Enforcement, Police Department, and the Police Chief \n1122 undertakes to cite Plaintiffs and Class members for nighttime RV parking and for \n1133 vehicle  habitation.    Defendant  CITY  OF  SAN  DIEGO  also  demands  exorbitant \n1144 penalties that Plaintiffs and Class members cannot afford to pay, impounds and/or \n1155 threatens to impound their RVs or other vehicles, and threatens them with arrest, all \n1166 the while refusing to provide reasonable modifications of these policies based on \n1177 Plaintiffs’  and  Class  members’  disabilities.    Defendant  CITY  OF  SAN  DIEGO \n1188 implements the ticketing and impoundment of Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ vehicles \n1199 under the nighttime RV parking ordinance and the vehicle habitation ordinance even \n2200 though Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ vehicles are the only shelter from the elements \n2211 available to them and the only secure place they have to keep their belongings.  In \n2222 addition, the Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO has threatened Plaintiffs and Class \n2233 members with arrest and misdemeanor charges for illegal lodging.  \n2244 CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n2255   Plaintiffs bring this action against Defendant on their own behalf and on \n2266 behalf of all other persons similarly situated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n2277 23(b)(2). \n2288   The main class, referred to as the “Homeless Ticketing Class” or “Main \n  14 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.103     Page 17\nof 48\n \n11 Class” is defined as: \n22 All homeless persons who have been cited and/or subject to citation by \n33 the City of San Diego pursuant to San Diego Muni. Code §§ 86.0137(f); \n44 San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0139(a); and/or are at risk of arrest for illegal \n55 lodging. \n66   Plaintiffs also bring this action on behalf of a subclass, referred to as the \n77 “Disability Subclass” or “Subclass,” which is defined as: \n88 All Class members who have a “disability” as defined under the ADA, 42 \n99 U.S.C. § 12102. \n1100   All members of the Subclass are also members of the Main Class.  The \n1111 terms “Class” and “Classes” refers to both the Main Class and the Subclass collectively. \n1122   Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend or modify the Class definitions in \n1133 connection with a motion for class certification and/or with the result of discovery. \n1144 Numerosity \n1155 Main Class \n1166   Plaintiffs do not know the exact size or identities of the Class.  However, \n1177 Plaintiffs believe that the Class encompasses a minimum of several hundred homeless \n1188 individuals who are dispersed geographically throughout the City of San Diego as well \n1199 as California and neighboring states.  (2017 We All Count Results, REGIONAL TASK \n2200 FORCE ON THE HOMELESS (2017), http://www.rtfhsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/\n2211 2017-PITC-Results-Powerpoint.pdf.)  Therefore,  the  members  of  the  Class  are  so \n2222 numerous that individual joinder of all members is impracticable. \n2233   All members of the Class are subject to Defendant’s policies and practice \n2244 in  enforcing  the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance  and/or  the  vehicle  habitation \n2255 ordinance.  The Class is united in its interests with respect to proof of Defendant’s \n2266 conduct, and the effects caused by Defendant’s actions.   \n2277 Subclass \n2288   Plaintiffs  do  not  know  the  exact  size  or  identities  of  the  Disability \n  15 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.104     Page 18\nof 48\n \n11 Subclass.    Plaintiffs  believe  that  the  Subclass  consists  of  hundreds  of  homeless \n22 individuals based on the high number of persons with disabilities found in surveys of \n33 the homeless population in San Diego.  See ¶ 43, infra. \n44   All members of the Sub-Class are subject to Defendant’s discriminatory \n55 policies and practice in enforcing the nighttime RV parking ordinance and/or the \n66 vehicle habitation ordinance.  The Class is united in its interests with respect to proof \n77 of Defendant’s discriminatory conduct, and the effects caused by Defendant’s actions. \n88 Predominance of Common Issues \n99 Main Class \n1100   The  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  members  of  the  Class \n1111 predominate over questions that may affect individual Class members.  Such common \n1122 questions of law and fact include but are not limited to the following: \n1133 (i)  whether  Defendant’s  enforcement  of  San  Diego  Muni.  Code \n1144 §§ 86.0137(f) and 86.0139(a) including ticketing for “violation of signs” \n1155 prohibiting vehicle habitation under § 86.0112(E) has and continues to \n1166 violate 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by infringing upon Named Plaintiffs’ and Class \n1177 members’ constitutional rights, including by endangering Plaintiffs and \n1188 Class  members,  and  by  violating  their  right  to  travel,  right  to  equal \n1199 protection, and right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.   \n2200 (ii)  whether Named Plaintiffs and other Class members are at risk of arrest for \n2211 illegal  lodging  under  Defendant’s  existing  policies  because  they  are \n2222 homeless and need to live in their vehicles; \n2233 (iii)  whether Named Plaintiffs and other Class members are at risk that their \n2244 RV, camper or other vehicle will be impounded by the City for unpaid \n2255 tickets  along  with  their  personal  belongings  seized  because  they  are \n2266 homeless and need to use their vehicles as shelter;  \n2277 (iv)  whether Named Plaintiffs and the other Class members are entitled to \n2288 equitable relief, including system-wide policy changes to address the \n  16 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.105     Page 19\nof 48\n \n11 constitutional and statutory violations detailed in this Complaint. \n22 Subclass \n33 (i)  whether  Defendant’s  policies,  including  its  policies  regarding \n44 enforcement of San Diego Muni. Code §§ 86.0137(f) and 86.0139(a) including \n55 ticketing for “violation of signs” prohibiting habitation under § 86.0112(E) \n66 discriminate on the basis of disability; and \n77 (ii)  whether Defendant has failed or refused to provide reasonable \n88 modifications of their policies as required under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, \n99 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 749. \n1100 Typicality \n1111 Main Class \n1122   Named Plaintiffs are asserting claims typical of the claims of the entire \n1133 class of affected persons described above and do not conflict with the interests of any \n1144 other members of the Classes.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members have been injured \n1155 by the same wrongful policies, practices, and conduct of Defendant.  Named Plaintiffs’ \n1166 claims arise from the same practices and conduct that give rise to the claims of all Class \n1177 members and are based on the same legal theories. \n1188 Subclass \n1199   Named Plaintiffs are all qualified individuals with disabilities and assert \n2200 claims typical of the claims of the entire Disability Subclass.  The interests of the \n2211 Named Plaintiffs do not conflict with those of the Disability Subclass.  All have been \n2222 injured by the same wrongful policies, practices, and conduct of Defendant, which \n2233 discriminate on the basis of disability.  Named Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same \n2244 practices and conduct that give rise of all Subclass members and are based on the same \n2255 legal theories. \n2266 Adequate Representation \n2277   Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \n2288 Main Class and the Subclass, and they have no interests antagonistic to those of the \n  17 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.106     Page 20\nof 48\n \n11 Classes.    Indeed,  Named  Plaintiffs’  interests  are  aligned  with  those  of  the  Class \n22 members.  Named Plaintiffs have retained lawyers who are competent and experienced \n33 in class action litigation. \n44 Superiority \n55   A class action is preferable and superior to other available methods for the \n66 fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy.  Class treatment will permit the \n77 adjudication of claims by many Class members who could not afford to individually \n88 litigate their claims or vindicate their rights against the government.  There are no \n99 difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of this case that might preclude \n1100 its maintenance as a class action, and no superior alternative exists for the fair and \n1111 efficient adjudication of this matter. \n1122 COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n1133 Plaintiffs allege the following common facts on information and belief. \n1144 San Diego’s Lack of Affordable Housing Has Created a Homelessness Crisis \n1155   San Diego now has the fourth largest homeless population in the country.  \n1166 (The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, DEPT. OF HOUSING AND \n1177 URBAN  DEV.  29  (Nov.  2016),  https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/\n1188 2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf.)  Based on a January 2017 survey, the Regional Task Force \n1199 on the Homeless found that there are 5,619 homeless people in the City of San Diego, \n2200 an increase of 10% since 2016.  (2017 We All Count Results, supra at 16.)  The \n2211 Regional Task Force further found that 3,231 of these 5,619 homeless individuals are \n2222 unsheltered and living in places not meant for human habitation, an 18% increase from \n2233 the previous year.  According to the same survey, San Diego County now has a \n2244 homeless population of 9,116, more than double the approximately 4,000 shelter beds \n2255 available in the County.  The results of this crisis have been seen in the rapidly \n2266 expanding tent encampments in downtown San Diego that have more than doubled in \n2277 size in the past year.  \n2288   The homelessness crisis in San Diego is directly linked to the lack of \n  18 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.107     Page 21\nof 48\n \n11 affordable housing.  As of 2014, the median cost of an efficiency studio apartment in \n22 San Diego was 110% of the amount of an SSI check, which is less than $900/month.  \n33 (Emily  Cooper  et  al.,  Priced  Out  in  2014:  The  Housing  Crisis  for  People  with \n44 Disabilities, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COLLABORATIVE (June 2015), http://www.tacinc.\n55 org/media/52012/Priced%20Out%20in%202014.pdf.)    Since  then,  rents  have \n66 continued to rise.  The San Diego Housing Federation found that there is a shortfall of \n77 135,749 homes affordable to low income San Diegans, with rents up 32% in the last \n88 decade.  Average rent and utilities for a two-bedroom apartment has climbed to $1618 \n99 a month.

In addition, \n1122 the demand for housing subsidies far exceeds the supply.  There is a 10 to 12 year \n1133 waiting list for a Section 8 housing voucher, with over 60,000 persons on the waiting \n1144 list.  The small amount of existing affordable or subsidized housing also has long \n1155 waiting lists. \n1166   The  Regional  Task  Force  on  Homelessness  found  that  the  homeless \n1177 population in the City of San Diego included 817 people living in vehicles.  (2017 We \n1188 All Count Results, supra at 16.)  These individuals have no shelter available to them \n1199 other than in their vehicles.  RV owners without physical addresses have no legal place \n2200 to park their RVs at night.  The few “safe lots” established in San Diego only serve a \n2211 small portion of people with vehicles who are homeless, prioritize families with small \n2222 children, and exclude RVs.   \n2233   RV parks in San Diego charge high rents.  Monthly rentals in RV parks in \n2244 the City of San Diego range from a low of $699 per month to a high of $1950 per \n2255 month depending on the park and the time of year, which is unaffordable to Plaintiffs \n2266 and Class members.  Moreover, many RV parks have maximum stay limits and limit \n2277 or exclude older RVs. \n2288\n  19 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.108     Page 22\nof 48\n \n11 People with Disabilities Have Been Severely and Disproportionately  \n22 Harmed by the Crisis \n33   There is also a strong link between homelessness and disability.  The U.S. \n44 Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  defines  “chronically \n55 homeless” as an individual with a disability who has been homeless continuously for \n66 at least 12 months or on at least four separate occasions in the last three years.  24 \n77 C.F.R. § 91.5(1).  A person is deemed homeless if he or she lacks a fixed, regular, and \n88 adequate nighttime residence.  This includes persons who use RVs or other vehicles for \n99 other than temporary living quarters for recreational use.  42 U.S.C. § 11302(a)(1); 24 \n1100 C.F.R. § 3282.8(g).  The Regional Task Force found that 31% of the City’s homeless \n1111 population was “chronically homeless.”  (2017 We All Count Results, supra at 16.) \n1122   In San Diego, a high number of homeless individuals have disabilities.  \n1133 The Regional Task Force found that 39% of homeless people in San Diego reported \n1144 mental health disabilities and 40% reported a physical disability.  Some surveys have \n1155 found even higher rates of disability.  For example, of the 1,145 persons attending a \n1166 one-day resource fair for the homeless in the City, 60.2% reported a long lasting \n1177 medical condition and 49.5% reported having a mental illness.  San Diego Housing \n1188 Commission, Project Homeless Connection Report, April 15, 2015.(Project Homeless \n1199 Connect  Report,  SAN  DIEGO  HOUSING  COMMISSION  (April  15,  2015),  http://\n2200 www.sdhc.org/uploadedFiles/Housing_Innovations/Project_Homeless_Connect/\n2211 2015Project%20Homeless%20Connect%20Report_04.15.15.pdf.) \n2222   The  primary  reason  for  the  strong  link  between  disability  and \n2233 homelessness is an economic one.  Homeless individuals with disabilities are not \n2244 normally  homeless  as  a  matter  of  choice.    Rather,  many  people  with  disabilities \n2255 including  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  are  unable  to  work  due  to  their \n2266 disabilities and therefore must rely on a rapidly shrinking social safety net that has not \n2277 kept up with rising San Diego rents.   \n2288   Living on the streets is dangerous, especially for women, seniors, and \n  20 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.109     Page 23\nof 48\n \n11 people with disabilities.  In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, 117 homeless \n22 people died on the streets of San Diego, double the figure from two years ago.

Homeless adults age 50 and older also \n66 have rates of chronic illness and geriatric conditions similar to or higher than those of \n77 adults living in housing that are 15 to 20 years older.  Jennifer Goldberg, et al., “How \n88 to Prevent and End Homelessness Among Older Adults.”  (Jennifer Goldberg et al., \n99 How to Prevent and End Homelessness Among Older Adults, JUSTICE IN AGING (April \n1100 2016),  http://www.justiceinaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Homelessness-\n1111 Older-Adults.pdf.) \n1122   The City’s recent Hepatitis A epidemic highlights the health dangers, both \n1133 to homeless individuals and to others, associated with living on the streets without \n1144 access to shelter and sanitation.  The Hepatitis A outbreak has resulted in at least twenty \n1155 deaths.  \n1166 Plaintiffs and Class Members Have No Reasonable Option for Shelter Other \n1177 Than Their RVs or Other Vehicles  \n1188   Sheltering oneself is not voluntary conduct.  It is a basic human need.  It \n1199 is harmless. And it is an act integral to the status of homelessness.  For Named Plaintiffs \n2200 and  Class  members  fortunate  enough  to  have  RVs  or  other  vehicles,  their  only \n2211 reasonable option is to utilize the rudimentary shelter provided by their vehicles until \n2222 permanent,  accessible,  and  medically  appropriate  housing  that  they  can  afford, \n2233 becomes available. \n2244   Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  do  not  have  any  reasonably \n2255 accessible places in the City to seek shelter in their vehicles or to park their RVs legally \n2266 at night.  As explained above, RV parks in San Diego are generally unaffordable to \n2277 Plaintiffs and Class members.  Dreams of Change operates a “Safe Parking Program,” \n2288 which provides a few places to park vehicles at night.  As of mid-October 2017, \n  21 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.110     Page 24\nof 48\n \n11 Dreams of Changes operates three such lots in the City.  However, there are currently \n22 only 150 parking spaces available, a fraction of the number of unsheltered homeless \n33 people with vehicles.  The Program has frequently had long waiting lists for admission.  \n44 RVs are not accepted.  In the absence of permanent housing options, all participants \n55 are required to sign up for so-called transitional housing programs that provide only \n66 temporary  or  short-term  shelter,  and  are  often  inaccessible  and/or  medically \n77 unacceptable to Plaintiffs and to Disability Subclass members. \n88   There is also an insufficient number of temporary shelter beds available \n99 in the City as compared to the unsheltered homeless population forced to seek shelter \n1100 in their vehicles.  There are hundreds more unsheltered homeless people forced to seek \n1111 shelter in their vehicles than available emergency shelter beds, even when accounting \n1122 for seasonal and overflow spaces. \n1133   Even  if  a  homeless  person  is  able  to  identify  an  available  bed  in  a \n1144 temporary or emergency shelter, the shelter bed may be functionally unavailable to that \n1155 person.  Emergency and temporary shelter beds and transitional housing programs are \n1166 functionally  unavailable  to  many  people  with  disabilities  including  the  Named \n1177 Plaintiffs, because those types of living arrangements are likely to aggravate their \n1188 mental health and/or physical conditions.  Many shelters and transitional housing \n1199 programs in San Diego have an overcrowded congregate living environment, are noisy, \n2200 have a complete lack of privacy, often lack opportunity to lie down during the day, \n \n2211 present an increased risk of infection, may have strong odors from smoke and chemical \n2222 cleaning products that can aggravate respiratory disabilities, and present the risk of \n \n2233 criminal activity.  In addition, many shelters only take single people, thereby separating \n2244 family members and causing additional trauma.  \n2255   Emergency and temporary shelters including most transitional housing \n2266 programs do not provide a real solution for Named Plaintiffs or Class members.  Even \n2277 if they were to enter a temporary or emergency shelter or be admitted into a transitional \n2288 housing program, Named Plaintiffs and Class members with RVs would still not have \n  22 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.111     Page 25\nof 48\n \n11 anywhere to park their RVs legally at night and would continue to be at risk of ticketing \n22 under the nighttime RV parking ordinance.  Moreover, these programs provide only \n33 temporary  accommodations  with  strict  time  limits.  The  Regional  Taskforce  on \n44 Homelessness has found that a majority of persons exited from shelter programs have \n55 not  been  placed  in  permanent  housing.    Therefore,  in  the  continued  absence  of \n66 sufficient permanent affordable housing alternatives, even individuals who are able to \n77 use the shelter system are often condemned to spending at least some time on the \n88 streets, with all the associated health and safety risks.  Thus, under current conditions, \n99 there are no reasonable alternatives for Named Plaintiffs and Class members other than \n1100 utilizing their RVs or other vehicles. \n1111 City Ordinances Punish Homeless Individuals with Vehicles \n1122   The City’s “Prohibition of Use of Streets for Storage, Service or Sale of \n1133 Vehicles or For Habitation” ordinance, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0137(f), provides: \n1144 “It is unlawful for any person to use a vehicle while it is parked or standing on any \n1155 streets as either temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation.”  \n1166 The terms “temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation” are \n1177 not defined.  A ticket for vehicle habitation is punishable as an infraction by a fine of \n1188 $40 plus a $12.50 surcharge and doubles if not paid in 21 days.  \n1199    The City has posted signs in various locations within the City stating “No \n2200 Habitation.”  Named Plaintiffs and Class members have been ticketed and/or are at risk \n2211 of being ticketed for “Violation of Signs” under San Diego Muni. Cod § 86.0112(E) \n2222 for  allegedly  “habitating”  in  their  vehicles.  A  ticket  for  “Violation  of  Signs”  is \n2233 punishable as an infraction by a fine of $40 plus a $12.50 surcharge and doubles if not \n2244 paid in 21 days.  \n2255   The City’s “Prohibition of Parking of Oversized, Non-Motorized and \n2266 Recreational Vehicles” ordinance, San Diego Muni. Code § 86.0139(a), provides in \n2277 relevant part: “Except as provided in section 86.0140 or otherwise expressly provided \n2288 to the contrary herein, or unless such parking or standing is authorized by the City \n  23 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.112     Page 26\nof 48\n \n11 Manager and appropriate sign permitting such parking or standing are posted: (a) it is \n22 unlawful for any person to park or leave standing upon any public street, park road or \n33 park parking lot, any oversized, non-motorized or recreational vehicle between the \n44 hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.”  A ticket for nighttime RV parking is punishable as \n55 an infraction by a fine of $100 plus a $12.50 surcharge and doubles if not paid in 21 \n66 days. \n77   In addition to fines, there is the potential for other serious consequences \n88 for violating these ordinances.  A vehicle can be removed or impounded by the City \n99 when it has five or more unpaid parking violations.  Cal. Veh. Code § 22651.  In \n1100 addition, the City may notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the DMV \n1111 will not renew the registration until the penalties are paid.  Cal. Veh. Code §§ 4760 and \n1122 40229(a). \n1133   Though it has made no exceptions to any of these ordinances on the basis \n1144 of homelessness or disability, the City has created an exception to its nighttime RV \n1155 parking ordinance via a permit process that allows for temporary overnight parking of \n1166 RVs on public streets for a cumulative total of up to 72 days in a given year.  San Diego \n1177 Muni. Code § 86.0143.  Such permits are only available for people with physical \n1188 addresses, thereby excluding persons whose only stable form of shelter is their RVs, \n1199 including Named Plaintiffs and Class members.  Id.  Named Plaintiffs and Class \n2200 members are therefore left with no options anywhere in the City to park their RVs at \n2211 night whether or not they are able to access a temporary shelter bed. \n2222   On information and belief, the City enacted the nighttime RV parking \n2233 ordinance in 2013 for the primary purpose of removing homeless RV owners from the \n2244 community.  The City enacted the ordinance in large part due to the difficulty the City \n2255 was having proving that such homeless persons are in violation of the existing vehicle \n2266 habitation ordinance, and due to problems the City had experienced enforcing the \n2277 ordinance prohibiting parking a vehicle in excess of 72 consecutive hours.

At  a  subsequent \n88 Mission Beach Town Council meeting, Julio DeGuzman from the San Diego City \n99 Attorney’s  office  responded  to  complaints  regarding  an  increasing  number  of \n1100 “transients” with RVs, by reassuring the attendees that his office “works on removing \n1111 the  homeless  from  our  community.”    (Minutes  of  General  Membership  Meeting, \n1122 MISSION BEACH TOWN COUNCIL (Nov. 13, 2013), http://www.missionbeachtc.com/\n1133 uploads/5/0/0/3/50033147/mbtc_minutes_general_mtg_nov.13.2013.pdf.) \n1144   Defendant has had and continues to have a policy and practice of utilizing \n1155 these ordinances to issue and/or threaten to issue parking tickets to homeless vehicle \n1166 owners, including to individuals with disability placards or special disabled license \n1177 plates issued by the State of California prominently displayed on their vehicles, to \n1188 impose exorbitant penalties, and to impound their vehicles for failure to pay the \n1199 penalties.  Defendant has carried out this policy even though it knew or reasonably \n2200 should have known that the majority of the “transients” being targeted for ticketing \n2211 have a disability and/or have no other reasonable option for shelter besides their \n2222 vehicles.  San Diego police officers and other agents and employees of the City knew \n2233 or reasonably should have known that many of the individuals receiving these tickets \n2244 have disabilities due to the fact that disability placards are commonly displayed on the \n2255 vehicles; and even in the absence of a disability placard, the officers may have had an \n2266 opportunity to observe or interact with the persons being ticketed, who either had an \n2277 obvious disability or voluntarily disclosed the disability to the officer. \n2288   State  law  considers  a  person  guilty  of  Disorderly  Conduct,  a \n  25 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.114     Page 28\nof 48\n \n11 misdemeanor,  if  the  person  “lodges  in  any  building,  structure,  vehicle,  or  place, \n22 whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to the \n33 possession or in control of it.”  Cal. Penal Code § 647(e).  Violation of the statute \n44 carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine.  The language of the \n55 statute makes clear that the City has the authority to grant permission to persons \n66 lodging in vehicles to stay on public property and therefore such arrests or threats of \n77 arrest are purely discretionary. \n88 The City Has Refused to Modify Its Discriminatory Policies \n99   On March 30, 2017, seven of the Plaintiffs—Michael Bloom, Stephen \n1100 Chatzky, Valerie Grischy, Penny Helms, Doug Higgins, Suzonne Keith, and David \n1111 Wilson—acting through their attorneys, delivered to the office of the City Attorney a \n1122 written request for a reasonable modification of the City’s ticketing policies pursuant \n1133 to the provisions of Title II of the ADA.  The reasonable modification would allow \n1144 them and other homeless RV owners with disabilities to continue to live in San Diego \n1155 and  fully  utilize  their  RVs  as  shelter,  including  at  night  without  ticketing  and \n1166 harassment.    The  request  included  supporting  evidence  documenting  each  of  the \n1177 individual’s disability-related need to utilize their RVs.   \n1188   Plaintiffs are aware of multiple parking lots under City control that are \n1199 empty at night, and that could be used by Named Plaintiffs and Class members for \n2200 nighttime parking of their RVs.  Plaintiffs are also aware of streets in industrial areas \n2211 that are empty at night and have ample places to park RVs. The use of these lots and \n2222 industrial areas for nighttime parking of Class members’ RVs would not infringe on \n2233 residential parking or otherwise inconvenience other City residents. \n2244   In  response  to  Plaintiffs’  reasonable  modification  request,  the  City \n2255 Attorney’s office held one meeting with Plaintiffs’ counsel on May 9, 2017.  Over the \n2266 next two months, and despite the urgency of this matter to Plaintiffs’ health and safety, \n2277 the City did not take or propose any actions to address Plaintiffs’ concerns.  The City, \n2288 while claiming an interest in seeking a resolution, continued to ticket homeless RV \n  26 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.115     Page 29\nof 48\n \n11 owners and to impound their vehicles including those with disabilities.  The City’s \n22 actions showed an unwillingness to make reasonable modifications to its nighttime RV \n33 parking and vehicle habitation ordinances. \n44   On  July  8,  2017,  Plaintiffs  requested  that  the  City  temporarily  halt \n55 enforcement of San Diego Muni. Code §§ 86.0139(a) and 86.0137(f) to stop ticketing \n66 homeless RV owners and impounding their RV’s pending a final resolution of the \n77 matter.  The City again stalled, waiting until August 23, 2017, before telling Plaintiffs \n88 that it would not agree to halt enforcement of these ordinances temporarily.  Because \n99 of the continued harm being caused to Named Plaintiffs and Class members, Plaintiffs \n1100 have no choice now but to file this Complaint. \n1111 CLAIMS \n1122 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION   \n1133 Violation of Substantive Due Process—State Created Danger  \n1144 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n1155   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n1166 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1177   Under the Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \n1188 the state deprives a person of a substantive due process right if it affirmatively places \n1199 the person in a position of danger.  Wood v. Ostrander, 875 F. 2d 578, 583 (9th Cir. \n2200 1989). \n2211   Defendant City of San Diego has a policy, pattern, custom, and practice \n2222 of issuing citations to Named Plaintiffs and Class members under the above-described \n2233 ordinances, and when said Class members are unable to pay the citation, impounding \n2244 RVs or other vehicles that Plaintiffs and Class members rely on for shelter from the \n2255 elements and for other necessities.   \n2266   As a direct result of that policy and practice, Defendant, through its \n2277 agents,  employees,  officials  and  departments,  has  acted  and  continues  to  act \n2288 affirmatively as described herein to place Plaintiffs and Class members in a highly \n  27 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.116     Page 30\nof 48\n \n11 dangerous situation that they would not otherwise face, thereby threatening Plaintiffs’ \n22 and  Class  members’  health  and  safety,  risking  serious  exacerbations  of  their \n33 disabilities, and putting their lives at risk. \n44   As  a  direct  result  of  its  policy  and  practice,  Defendant  has  acted \n55 affirmatively by citing Plaintiffs and Class members for parking and vehicle habitation \n66 violations that they cannot reasonably avoid, thereby forcing Plaintiffs and Class \n77 members to attempt to pay more than they can afford on exorbitant fines.  Plaintiffs \n88 and Class members who attempt to pay these fines must sacrifice paying for life-\n99 sustaining food, medication, or other necessities.  And when they can no longer afford \n1100 the fines, they lose the only form of shelter available to them—their RV or vehicle—\n1111 through impoundment.  Without their vehicle, Plaintiffs and Class members are highly \n1122 likely to be forced into the ranks of the unsheltered homeless and face the dangers \n1133 described herein of living on the streets. In addition, Class members who have their \n1144 RVs taken are deprived of other necessities of life previously provided by their RV \n1155 including ready access to running water, toilet, shower, cooking and food storage \n1166 facilities;  temperature  control;  and  secure  sleeping  accommodations,  causing  a \n1177 significant negative impact on their physical and/or mental health. \n1188   In the absence of Defendant’s affirmative actions, Plaintiffs and Class \n1199 members  would  not  face  these  highly  dangerous  situations.    Defendant  knew  or \n2200 reasonably should have known that its actions—up to and including taking away \n2211 Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ only form of shelter—would create these threats to \n2222 Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ health and safety. \n2233   Defendant acted with reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the \n2244 dangers—malnourishment, illness, and/or aggravation of disabilities due to loss of \n2255 shelter—they  were  creating  for  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members  by  issuing  and/or \n2266 threatening  to  issue  nighttime  RV  parking  and  vehicle  habitation  citations  and \n2277 impounding RVs and other vehicles.

Defendant’s actions show a reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to \n33 the health, safety and well-being of Plaintiffs and Class members, in violation of \n44 Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth \n55 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Wood, 875 F. 2d at 583. \n66   As a result of Defendant’s policies and practices described herein, Named \n77 Plaintiffs’ health and safety were placed in grave danger in violation of the Fourteenth \n88 Amendment.  Named Plaintiffs were injured and damaged in that they were forced to \n99 bear the risks and medical costs created by these acts.  In addition to that cost, the \n1100 Named Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because \n1111 of the danger created by Defendant’s unlawful actions.  Defendant’s unlawful actions \n1122 and the resulting injuries entitle Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including \n1133 damages for emotional distress. \n1144   An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Class members on the \n1155 one hand, and Defendant on the other, as to whether Defendant has violated and/or are \n1166 imminently threatening to violate 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1177   Plaintiffs and Class members have no adequate remedy at law for the \n1188 violations stated herein and are therefore entitled to injunctive, declaratory, and other \n1199 equitable relief, including restitution for fines and assessments collected and vehicles \n2200 impounded by Defendant.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs. \n2211 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n2222 Violation of Cruel and Unusual Punishment  \n2233 (Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n2244   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2255 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n2266   The  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  provides  that \n2277 “[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and \n2288 unusual punishments inflicted.” \n  29 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.118     Page 32\nof 48\n \n11   Defendant’s practice and policy of issuing tickets and threats of tickets for \n22 nighttime  RV  parking  and  vehicle  habitation  to  Plaintiffs  and  Class  members, \n33 impounding their RVs and vehicles as a result of those offenses, and threats of arrest \n44 for  vehicle  habitation  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  on  cruel  and \n55 unusual punishment because it constitutes a punishment that is disproportionate to the \n66 severity of the “crime” of violating the nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation \n77 ordinances or of lodging in one’s vehicle on City streets.  See Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. \n88 277 (1983). \n99   The punishments inflicted by Defendant for violation of the ordinances in \n1100 question force Named Plaintiffs and Class members to attempt to pay more than they \n1111 can afford on exorbitant fines.  Plaintiffs and Class members who attempt to pay these \n1122 fines must sacrifice paying for life-sustaining food, medication or other necessities.  \n1133 And when they can no longer afford the fines, they lose the only form of shelter \n1144 available to them—their RV or vehicle—through impoundment.  With their RVs or \n1155 vehicles taken from them, Plaintiffs and Class members face the dangers described \n1166 herein of living on the streets without shelter and/or without the other necessities of \n1177 life provided by their RVs. \n1188    These  punishments  grossly  outweigh  any  interest  on  the  part  of \n1199 Defendant in preventing Plaintiffs and Class members from parking on city streets at \n2200 certain times of the day and/or seeking shelter in their vehicles. \n2211   For  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Disability  Subclass  members,  Defendant’s \n2222 practice and policy also violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and \n2233 unusual punishment because it punishes Named Plaintiffs and Disability Subclass \n2244 members for being homeless.  By punishing the act of sheltering oneself in a vehicle \n2255 when there are no other reasonable alternatives, the City effectively punishes the status \n2266 of homelessness.  Defendant infringes Plaintiffs’ and Subclass members’ rights by \n2277 issuing tickets and threats of tickets for nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation, \n2288 as  well  as  by  impounding  RVs  and  vehicles,  and  threatening  arrest  for  vehicle \n  30 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.119     Page 33\nof 48\n \n11 habitation.  See Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962); Jones v. City of Los \n22 Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated after settlement, 505 F.3d 1006 (9th \n33 Cir. 2007). \n44   Named  Plaintiffs  and  Disability  Subclass  members  are  involuntarily \n55 homeless.  They are homeless because their disabilities led to their unemployment and \n66 poverty, and because the City lacks affordable permanent housing and accessible, \n77 adequate, and available shelters.  They cannot reasonably forego sheltering themselves, \n88 as sheltering oneself is a basic human need.  It is harmless.  And it is an act integral to \n99 the status of homelessness.  Until permanent, affordable, and accessible housing is \n1100 available to them, their RVs or other vehicles are their only option for meeting their \n1111 basic human need for shelter and for other necessities of life that housing normally \n1122 provides. \n1133   As a result of Defendant inflicting cruel and unusual punishment under \n1144 color of law in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Named \n1155 Plaintiffs were injured and damaged in that they were forced to pay exorbitant fines \n1166 they could not afford to pay, and/or were deprived of the use of their only available \n1177 shelter—their RVs or other vehicles—and were forced to bear the cost of finding and \n1188 securing whatever other accommodations they could obtain.  In addition to that cost, \n1199 the Named Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation \n2200 because of this violation of their rights.  Defendant’s unlawful actions and the resulting \n2211 injuries entitle Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including damages for \n2222 emotional distress.  Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and \n2233 declaratory relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n2244 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n2255 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Void for Vagueness \n2266 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n2277   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2288 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  31 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.120     Page 34\nof 48\n \n11   The Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n22 U.S. Constitution provides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or \n33 property, without due process of law.” \n44   In  order  to  satisfy  the  Due  Process  Clause,  an  ordinance  must  be \n55 sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and provide \n66 sufficient guidelines for the police so that arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement \n77 does not occur.  Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 9 Cal. 4th 1069, 1106-1107 (1995). \n88   San  Diego’s  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  does  not  satisfy  the \n99 requirements of the Due Process Clause.  As written, the vehicle habitation ordinance \n1100 makes  unlawful  the  use  of  a  vehicle  parked  or  standing  on  the  street  as  “either \n1111 temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of habitation.”  None of the \n1122 terms used—“temporary living quarters,” “permanent living quarters,” “abode” or \n1133 “place of habitation”—are defined anywhere in the ordinance. \n1144   The City’s vehicle habitation ordinance (whether enforced directly or \n1155 indirectly through citations issued under “Violation of Signs” prohibiting habitation) \n1166 fails  to  provide  adequate  notice  and  sufficient  guidance,  which  would  allow  an \n1177 individual to ascertain beyond mere speculation as to how one uses a parked or \n1188 standing vehicle as “either temporary or permanent living quarters, abode, or place of \n1199 habitation.”  The ordinance therefore fails “to draw a clear line between innocent and \n2200 criminal conduct,” Desertrain v. City of Los Angeles, 754 F. 3d 1147, 1156 (9th Cir. \n2211 2014), and invites selective enforcement against people who are homeless, many of \n2222 whom have disabilities.  As detailed above, Named Plaintiffs and Class members have \n2233 attempted to comply with the vehicle habitation ordinance but have nonetheless been \n2244 ticketed under its vague and overbroad reach. \n2255   The  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  should  therefore  be  declared \n2266 unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied against Named Plaintiffs and \n2277 Class members in violation of substantive due process protections under the Fourteenth \n2288 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n  32 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.121     Page 35\nof 48\n \n11   As a result of the Defendant’s actions under color of law in violation of \n22 the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Named Plaintiffs and Class \n33 members have been and continue to be forced to pay fines and assessments they cannot \n44 afford to pay and have been and continue to be deprived of or threatened with the \n55 deprivation of their only available shelter—their RVs or other vehicles.  In addition to \n66 that  cost,  Named  Plaintiffs  suffered  emotional  and  mental  distress  as  well  as \n77 humiliation because of this violation of their rights.  Defendant’s unlawful actions and \n88 the resulting injuries entitle Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including \n99 damages for emotional distress.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled \n1100 to injunctive and declaratory relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n1111 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n1122 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Right to Travel  \n1133 (Fourteenth Amendment; Cal. Const. Art. 1, §§ 7 and 24; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n1144   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n1155 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n1166   The  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  protects  as  a \n1177 hallmark of personal liberty the right to travel to whatever place one’s own inclination \n1188 may  direct  and  stay  as  long  as  one  wishes.    Enforcement  practices  that  deprive \n1199 individuals of a basic necessity of life may be found to burden the right to travel \n2200 unconstitutionally.  Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974); \n2211 Pottinger v. Miami, 810 F. Supp. 1551 (S.D. Fla. 1992).  “The right to travel has found \n2222 its strongest expression in the context of attempts by states to discourage the in-\n2233 migration of indigents.”  Joyce v. City & Cty. of S.F., 846 F. Supp. 843, 860 (N.D. Cal. \n2244 1994).  The California Constitution also specifically protects the right to intrastate \n2255 travel.  Cal. Const. Art. 1, §§ 7 and 24; Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, 9 Cal. 4th 1069 (Cal. \n2266 1995). \n2277   Defendant’s pattern and practice of ticketing Named Plaintiffs and Class \n2288 members under its nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation ordinances directly \n  33 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.122     Page 36\nof 48\n \n11 infringes Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Right to Travel.  Defendant has created \n22 an RV parking permit process available to most city residents to allow nighttime RV \n33 parking, but have denied access to that permitting process to Named Plaintiffs and \n44 Class members.  Defendant has conducted these activities by collecting exorbitant fines \n55 that Named Plaintiffs cannot afford to pay, impounding their vehicles, and threatening \n66 criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor, even though Named Plaintiffs and Class \n77 members have no reasonable alternative but to utilize the rudimentary shelter provided \n88 by their vehicles.  This conduct has the purpose and effect of depriving or threatening \n99 to deprive Named Plaintiffs and Class members of the necessities of life, including \n1100 food, shelter, and medicine, thereby preventing Named Plaintiffs and Class members \n1111 from traveling to and residing in San Diego. \n1122   Defendant’s  enforcement  of  the  nighttime  RV  parking  ordinance \n1133 specifically leaves Named Plaintiffs and Class members with no options for parking \n1144 their RVs between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM.  Since Named Plaintiffs and Class members \n1155 lack the means to pay for housing or private parking and temporary shelters are not \n1166 available to them, Named Plaintiffs and Class members cannot reasonably be in the \n1177 City within those times, effectively depriving them of all shelter while traveling within \n1188 the City. \n1199   Defendant’s  enforcement  of  the  vehicle  habitation  ordinance  also \n2200 infringes Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Right to Travel by preventing them \n2211 from obtaining shelter in the City of San Diego in the only way available to them (in \n2222 their vehicles), thereby depriving them of that basic necessity in the City.  As described \n2233 herein, Named Plaintiffs and Class members lack the means to obtain housing or to \n2244 pay for private parking for their vehicles in the City, and emergency and temporary \n2255 shelters,  including  transitional  housing  programs  lack  capacity  and  in  the  large \n2266 majority of cases, provide at best only transitory accommodations. In the case of \n2277 Disability Sub-Class members, such shelter programs are usually inaccessible and \n2288 therefore not available to them, due to their disabilities and medical conditions. \n  34 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.123     Page 37\nof 48\n \n11   Defendant’s actions have violated Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ \n22 Right to Travel under both the Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution \n33 by refusing to provide an exemption to the nighttime RV parking ordinance based on \n44 homelessness or disability.  The City has provided an exemption to its nighttime RV \n55 parking ordinance via a permit process that allows people with physical addresses to \n66 park RVs and oversized vehicles from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM, but has denied the same \n77 rights  to  those  without  physical  addresses,  including  Named  Plaintiffs  and  Class \n88 members.  Defendant’s enforcement of the nighttime RV parking ordinance against \n99 Named Plaintiffs and Class members denies them the basic necessity of shelter and \n1100 violates their Constitutional Right to Travel. \n1111   Defendant’s actions therefore unconstitutionally infringe on the Right to \n1122 Travel protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the \n1133 California Constitution. \n1144   As a result of Defendant’s actions under color of law in violation of the \n1155 Right to Travel under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs \n1166 and Class members were forced to pay citations that they could not afford, and/or lost \n1177 their vehicles through impoundment, thereby depriving them of the use of their only \n1188 available  shelter—their  RVs  or  other  vehicles.    In  addition  to  that  cost,  Named \n1199 Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because of this \n2200 violation of their rights.  Defendant’s unlawful actions and the resulting injuries entitle \n2211 Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages including damages for emotional distress.  \n2222 Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n2233 relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n2244 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n2255 Violation of Substantive Due Process—Equal Protection  \n2266 (Fourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n2277   Plaintiffs hereby incorporate each and every allegation contained in the \n2288 foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  35 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.124     Page 38\nof 48\n \n11   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment dictates that \n22 no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  \n33 Conduct violates the Equal Protection Clause when it disproportionately affects a \n44 suspect class or impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 \n55 U.S. 202, 216-17 (1982). \n66   Defendant  discriminates  against  homeless  individuals  through  the \n77 enforcement of the nighttime RV parking ordinance by providing an exemption to the \n88 prohibition contained in its nighttime RV parking ordinance via a permit process that \n99 allows people with physical addresses to park RVs and oversized vehicles from 2:00 \n1100 AM to 6:00 AM, but denies the same rights to those without physical addresses, \n1111 including Named Plaintiffs and Class members. \n1122   Defendant’s policies and practices further prevent Named Plaintiffs and \n1133 Class members from obtaining benefits provided by the City by blocking them from \n1144 obtaining a permit exempting them from the nighttime RV parking ordinance.  These \n1155 actions by Defendant have no rational connection to a legitimate government interest.  \n1166 In adopting and implementing these policies and practices as above stated, Defendant \n1177 has thus violated and continue to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United \n1188 States Constitution. \n1199   Defendant’s above-described policies and practices of ticketing homeless \n2200 vehicle owners under its nighttime RV parking and vehicle habitation ordinances and \n2211 impounding their RVs or other vehicles serve to single out and discriminate against \n2222 homeless people and/or people with disabilities, including Named Plaintiffs and Class \n2233 members.  Named Plaintiffs and Class members are being singled out for enforcement \n2244 of these ordinances that are not enforced against people with RVs or other vehicles who \n2255 do not appear to be homeless or disabled.  Defendant’s selective enforcement of these \n2266 ordinances violates Named Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ right to Equal Protection \n2277 under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n2288   Defendant’s conduct prevents Named Plaintiffs and Class members from \n  36 Case No. 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-NLS\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 14     Filed 02/14/18     PageID.125     Page 39\nof 48\n \n11 traveling to the City of San Diego without fear of ticketing and arrest, as detailed in \n22 the  Fourth  Cause  of  Action.    This  restriction  of  the  right  to  travel  infringes  a \n33 fundamental right, is not substantially related to any important government interest, \n44 and therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n55   As a result of Defendant’s actions under color of law in violation of the \n66 Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Named Plaintiffs and Class \n77 members were forced to pay citations that they could not afford, and/or lost their \n88 vehicles  through  impoundment,  thereby  depriving  them  of  the  use  of  their  only \n99 available  shelter—their  RVs  or  other  vehicles.    In  addition  to  that  cost,  Named \n1100 Plaintiffs suffered emotional and mental distress as well as humiliation because of this \n1111 violation of their rights.  Defendant’s unlawful actions and the resulting injuries entitle \n1122 Named Plaintiffs to compensatory damages, including damages for emotional distress.  \n1133 Named Plaintiffs and Class members are also entitled to injunctive and declaratory \n1144 relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees and costs. \n1155 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n1166 Violation of California Constitution - Due Process and Equal Protection  \n1177 (Cal.

No. 329-2) reached \n4 \nbetween the parties in this matter and instructing the Defendant(s) to remove or \n5 \nmodify the signs currently posted in accordance with the intent and terms of the \n6 \nsettlement. In support of this motion, Plaintiff(s) state as follows: \n7 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n8 \nA. Issue in Dispute \n9 \nOn October 10, 2024, the Court issued final approval of the parties’ \n10 \nSettlement Agreement (Doc. No. 329-2), and jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement \n11 \nfor three years was delegated to Magistrate Judge Butcher. Despite the terms of the \n12 \nSettlement Agreement, however, the City has refused to modify or remove both the \n13 \nVHO and OVO signs. Because the signs remain unchanged, they misstate and \n14 \nmisalign with the terms of the Agreement and mislead class members about their \n15 \nrights under the Agreement. The City has refused to remove or modify the signage. \n16 \nB. Current Signage: \n17 \nOVO signs, posted throughout the city, currently state in relevant part: \"NO \n18 \nPARKING ALL CITY STREETS OVERSIZED VEHICLES (EXCEEDING 27' \n19 \nLONG AND 7' HIGH) NON-MOTORIZED VEHICLES RECREATIONAL \n20 \nVEHICLES 2AM-6AM EXCEPT BY CITY PERMIT.\" Chatsky Decl. Exh. A. \n21 \nVHO signs observed posted throughout the area of Mission Bay where many \n22 \nclass members park, currently state: \"HABITATION IN VEHICLE PROHIBITED \n23 \nFROM 9PM TO 6AM,\" while others read, \"HABITATION IN VEHICLE \n24 \nPROHIBITED AT ANY TIME.\" Menasche Decl., Exhs. E to K. \n25 \nC. Efforts to Resolve the Issue \n26 \nPlaintiffs, through counsel, have made extensive efforts to ensure the City’s \n27 \ncompliance with the Settlement Agreement by addressing the improper signage \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  2 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7232     Page 3\nof 9\n \n1 \nand ticketing practices. Plaintiffs participated with the City in multiple meetings \n2 \nover many months in an effort to resolve these issues without court intervention. \n3 \nDespite notice and good faith attempts to resolve these violations, the City has \n4 \nrefused to take corrective action. \n5 \nSection 11 of the Settlement Agreement states in part, “It is the intent of the \n6 \nParties that any disputes concerning the interpretation or implementation of this \n7 \nAgreement be solved as swiftly and inexpensively as possible, initially through \n8 \ncommunication among counsel for the Parties, and, in the event such \n9 \ncommunication does not result in resolution, submission of the dispute for \n10 \nresolution by the Court.” Settlement Agreement at 7, § 11, Doc. No. 329-2. It \n11 \nfurther states, “To the extent non-compliance is identified, the responding Party \n12 \nwill have 45 days to cure the non-compliance (or identify a plan to cure any non-\n13 \ncompliance). If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within 45 days of the \n14 \nNotice of Dispute, the Party that served the Notice of Dispute may thereafter \n15 \npetition the Court through Judge Butcher for resolution of the Dispute, according \n16 \nto such procedures as the Court may direct.” Id. \n17 \nOn October 30, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Ann Menasche and Scott Dreher \n18 \nmet with Deputy City Attorney Jacqueline McQuarrie and formally notified her \n19 \nthat current city signage prohibiting vehicle habitation was inconsistent with the \n20 \nterms of the Settlement Agreement. Meeting minutes confirm Plaintiffs’ counsel \n21 \nraised concerns, specifically stating: “The signs that say, ‘No Vehicle Habitation’ \n22 \nare inconsistent with the Settlement Agreement, which expressly allows vehicle \n23 \nhabitation in most circumstances.” See Menasche Decl., Exh. A (Email to \n24 \nJacqueline McQuarrie(Oct. 30, 2024, 11:57 AM.) \n25 \nOn November 4, 2024, Ms. Menasche and her law clerk met with a class \n26 \nmember and toured the area of Mission Bay, taking photos of No Vehicle \n27 \nHabitation signs. Later that day, Ms. Menasche sent an email to Ms. McQuarrie \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  3 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7233     Page 4\nof 9\n \n1 \nwith copies of photos that were taken. Menasche Decl. Exh. B. On November 25, \n2 \n2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel submitted a formal proposal to the City to modify the \n3 \nlanguage as an alternative to removing the signage. Ms. Menasche wrote: “Here is \n4 \nour proposed language for amending the VHO and OVO signs. 1. VHO signs now \n5 \nreads: ’Vehicle habitation is prohibited at all times’, add except for people whose \n6 \nonly shelter is their vehicles. 2. OVO sign [], add: ‘Except for people whose only \n7 \nshelter is their vehicle and no spot in safe parking program is reasonably available. \n8 \nThe other acceptable alternative is to take them down.” Menasche Decl., Exh. C, \n9 \n(Email to Jacqueline McQuarrie, Nov. 25, 2024, 9:37 AM. \n10 \nAt a meeting between Plaintiffs’ Counsel and the City attorney’s office on \n11 \nDecember 21, 2024, Plaintiffs reiterated their concerns and requested yet another \n12 \nresponse from the City regarding the signage modifications. However, the City \n13 \nrefused to either amend or take down the signs. Meeting minutes confirm “The \n14 \nCity does not agree to amend or remove the VHO and OVO signs as Plaintiffs \n15 \nrequested.” Menasche Decl. Exh. D, (Email to Jacqueline McQuarrie, Dec. 21, \n16 \n2024, 2:32 PM) \n17 \nPlaintiffs have exhausted every reasonable avenue to bring the City into \n18 \ncompliance with the Settlement Agreement. Despite multiple notices, meetings, \n19 \nand a formal proposal for modification, the City has refused to take corrective \n20 \naction. Plaintiffs have acted in good faith, complied with Section 11 of the \n21 \nSettlement Agreement, including giving 45 days to resolve the dispute, and have \n22 \nprovided the City with every opportunity to rectify its non-compliance. Given the \n23 \nimpasse, Plaintiffs now seek judicial enforcement of the Settlement Agreement to \n24 \ncompel the City’s compliance with its obligations by either removing or modifying \n25 \nthe VHO and OVO signs. \n26 \n/// \n27 \n/// \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  4 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7234     Page 5\nof 9\n \n1 \nIntent of the Settlement Agreement \n2 \nThe primary intent of the Settlement Agreement between the parties is to \n3 \ndecriminalize living in one’s vehicle under the VHO, and to prevent the ticketing \n4 \nof oversized vehicles of class members for nighttime parking under the OVO when \n5 \nno reasonable parking options are available. This includes retroactive justice in the \n6 \nform of ticket forgiveness for parking violations related to the OVO and VHO \n7 \nwhich is in the process of being completed. These provisions enable class members \n8 \nto—lawfully—park their vehicles with narrow exceptions without the threat of \n9 \nreceiving tickets under the OVO or being subjected to criminal citations or arrest \n10 \nunder the VHO. \n11 \nThe intent of the Settlement Agreement is clearly demonstrated throughout \n12 \nits provisions. For example, Section 3 states, “The parties agree that the amended \n13 \nVHO training bulletin is intended to prevent VHO enforcement against Plaintiffs \n14 \nand class members who are sheltering in, resting in, sleeping in, or storing property \n15 \nin their vehicles, provided they are otherwise law-abiding and not committing any \n16 \ncriminal law violations, other than the VHO.\" Settlement Agreement at 2, § 3. \n17 \nFurther, Section 2 specifies, “… the City shall promptly forgive all unpaid OVO \n18 \ntickets for parking oversized vehicles between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. and for violations \n19 \nof signage related to VHO or OVO requirements during nighttime hours received \n20 \nby class members…” Settlement Agreement at 1, § 2. \n21 \nAn additional intent of the settlement is shown through the limitations \n22 \nplaced in OVO enforcement while the City expands its Safe Parking Program. The \n23 \nagreement states, “The City’s intent is to provide safe parking during nighttime \n24 \nhours that OVO and VHO would be enforced.” Settlement Agreement at 3, § 1 \n25 \n(Oct. 10, 2024). Enforcement of the OVO is subject to specific limitations to \n26 \nprotect individuals who use their vehicles as their primary shelter. The Settlement \n27 \nstates, “… If there is no safe parking available … the city will not enforce the \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  5 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7235     Page 6\nof 9\n \n1 \nnighttime provisions of the OVO and VHO at that time.”  Settlement Agreement at \n2 \n3, § 2. Legal nighttime parking is considered unavailable when the City's \n3 \ndesignated Safe Parking Lots are full, closed, or when no spot is reasonably \n4 \navailable to the individual, taking into account factors such as the type of vehicle, \n5 \ndistance to the lot, and whether there is adequate space for the vehicle. A critical \n6 \naspect of the settlement is the requirement for the City to provide daily updates on \n7 \nthe availability of spaces in these Safe Parking Lots. However, as of now, the City \n8 \nhas not yet established the necessary website to disseminate this information. \n9 \nConsequently, without a reliable method for individuals to verify the availability of \n10 \nlegal parking options, the enforcement of the OVO is effectively suspended until \n11 \nthe City fulfills its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. \n12 \nEven with a functioning website, right now there are no spaces available for \n13 \nclass members with oversized vehicles. The one Safe Lot open to oversized \n14 \nvehicles located at Mission Valley is at capacity. The new Safe Lot that is supposed \n15 \nto open, the H-Barracks, is tied up in litigation. \n16 \nThe intent of these provisions is unambiguous: to decriminalize living in \n17 \none’s vehicle under the VHO, prohibiting OVO ticketing when no reasonable \n18 \nparking options are available, and establishing additional lawful parking locations \n19 \nfor class members. The goal is to ensure that class members can lawfully park in \n20 \nthe City without the threat of ticketing or arrest. \n21 \nHowever, this intent is frustrated by Defendant(s) because the signs posted \n22 \nthroughout the city do not reflect the terms of the Settlement Agreement. As a \n23 \nresult, class members are actively misled as to their legal right to park their \n24 \noversized vehicles at night or to use their vehicle for shelter and not be subjected to \n25 \ncriminal persecution, undermining the purpose of the Settlement. Moreover, tickets \n26 \nunder the nighttime provisions of the OVO have continued to be issued after the \n27 \nsettlement was approved on October 10, 2024, further signaling to class members \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  6 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7236     Page 7\nof 9\n \n1 \nthat they are not permitted to park their RV or camper at night, contrary to the \n2 \nterms of the Settlement.1 \n3 \nGood Faith Performance and Implied Obligations \n4 \nIn addition to the express terms of the Settlement Agreement, the doctrine of \n5 \ngood faith and fair dealing requires that the parties perform their obligations in \n6 \ngood faith. This duty includes the removal or modification of city signs that \n7 \ncontradict the Agreement's intent. \n8 \nAs the California Supreme Court explained, “In every contract, there is an \n9 \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything \n10 \nwhich injures the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.” \n11 \nBrown v. Superior Court, 34 Cal. 2d 559, 212 P.2d 878 (1949). Furthermore, the \n12 \nlaw holds that “[A]ll things that in law or usage are considered as incidental to a \n13 \ncontract, or as necessary to carry it into effect, are implied therefrom, unless some \n14 \nof them are expressly mentioned therein, when all other things of the same class \n15 \nare deemed to be excluded.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1656 (West 2024). \n16 \nDefendant(s)’ failure to modify or remove the signs, prohibiting vehicle \n17 \nhabitation and nighttime oversized vehicle parking despite the Settlement \n18 \nAgreement’s clear intent to severely limit the enforcement of the VHO and OVO, \n19 \nbreaches the implied duty of good faith. The purpose of the Settlement was to \n20 \nallow otherwise law-abiding class members to live in their vehicles without risking \n21 \ncitation or arrest under the VHO and to park oversized vehicles at night as long as \n22 \nno reasonable options for parking are available without the threat of ticketing \n23 \nunder the OVO. The unaltered signs, which mislead class members and the public \n24 \nand continue to cause confusion, directly undermine that objective. \n25 \n26   \n1 The City has conceded that these OVO tickets were issued by mistake. Plaintiffs understand that these tickets will \n27  not be processed and/or will be automatically forgiven, though Plaintiffs have not yet received confirmation that this \nhas occurred. \n28 \nBloom, et al. v. City of San Diego, Case No. 3:17-CV-02324-AJB-DEB  7 \nMotion for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02324-AJB-DEB     Document 352     Filed 03/10/25     PageID.7237     Page 8\nof 9\n \n1 \nBy failing to act in a manner consistent with the purpose of the Agreement, \n2 \nDefendant(s) are frustrating the Agreement's very intent—ensuring that class \n3 \nmembers can park and live in their vehicles legally and without fear of \n4 \nenforcement of the VHO and OVO ordinances. This failure to correct the signage \n5 \nis a breach of the implied obligation to act in good faith, as it prevents class \n6 \nmembers from fully enjoying the benefits of the Settlement. Therefore, the City \n7 \nmust take immediate corrective action to ensure the signs reflect the true intent of \n8 \nthe Agreement and stop misleading the public. \n9 \nRelief Requested \n10 \nPlaintiff(s) respectfully request that this Court enforce the Settlement \n11 \nAgreement by ordering Defendant(s) to immediately modify or remove the signs \n12 \nthat are inconsistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  \n13 \nAttorney's Fees \n14 \nPlaintiff(s) request an award of attorney’s fees associated with the \n15 \nenforcement of the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to provision 10 of the \n16 \nSettlement Agreement, Plaintiff(s) believe that the funds allocated for enforcement \n17 \nshould be used to cover these fees and costs. In the alternative, Plaintiff(s) request \n18 \nthat the Court order Defendant(s) to reimburse Plaintiff(s) for the fees incurred in \n19 \nbringing this motion. \n20 \nConclusion \n21 \nFor the reasons set forth above, including the failure of Defendant(s) to act \n22 \nin good faith and to perform under the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff(s) \n23 \nrespectfully request that this Court enter an order enforcing the terms of the  \n24 \n/// \n25 \n/// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n/// \n28 \nBloom, et al. v.
