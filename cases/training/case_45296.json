Plaintiffs brought this putative class action against New York City's Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") alleging constitutional violations in connection with the investigative practices of ACS. The Court entered the following pretrial schedule: parties to exchange automatic disclosures by 9/9/2024; no amendment of the pleadings or joinder of additional parties permitted after 4/30/2025 without good cause; and parties to complete fact discovery by 5/30/2025. The Court defers setting an expert discovery schedule at this time.

          "description": "ORDER granting 2 MOTION for Leave to File Document / Leave to Proceed under a Pseudonym by Jane Doe 1.Doe 1 brings this action along with eight other named plaintiffs and on behalf of those similarly situated against the New York City's Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\"), alleging that \"ACS has a widespread custom, policy, and practice of entering and searching families' homes by using coercive tactics... to make parents feel that they have no choice but to allow caseworkers to enter and search their homes.\" Compl. para. 7, Dkt. 1. Plaintiff Doe 1 has filed an unopposed motion, Dkt. 2, seeking leave to proceed under a pseudonym. The Court grants Doe 1's motion for the reasons set forth below.A district court, after balancing \"the public interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the defendant,\" has the discretion to permit a plaintiff to proceed under a pseudonym if \"the plaintiff's need for anonymity\" outweighs the \"countervailing interests in full disclosure.\" Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189-90 (2d Cir. 2008) (setting forth a multi-factor test for assessing a plaintiff's ability to proceed under a pseudonym). Here, a majority of the factors set forth in Sealed Plaintiff weigh in favor of granting Doe 1's motion to proceed under a pseudonym.First, this case \"involves matters that are highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,\" id. at 190 (alteration in original), including intimate partner violence and allegations of child maltreatment. See R.F.M. v. Nielsen, 365 F. Supp. 3d 350, 371 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\"[F]acts supporting... findings of abuse, neglect, and abandonment are highly sensitive.\"); Doe v. Strategic P'Ships, Inc., No. 19-CV-695, 2019 WL 13253839, at *1-*3 (W.D. Tex. July 30, 2019) (allowing plaintiff to proceed under a pseudonym where the \"complaint contain[ed] facts related to [plaintiff's] status as a survivor of intimate partner violence and details her ex-partner's pattern of stalking and harassment\"). Second, \"identification poses a risk of retaliatory... mental harm,\" Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190, because Doe 1 fears that revealing her identity would subject her to retaliatory harassment from her ex-partner. See Doe v. Smith, 105 F. Supp. 2d 40, 45 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (\"[C]ourts have allowed plaintiffs to proceed anonymously where disclosure of their identities created a risk of harm from third parties unaffiliated with the case.\"). Doe 1 alleges that she has already been repeatedly subjected to harassment by her former partner and that he was the one who made false reports about her to ACS. See Doe 1's Mem. of Law at 1, Dkt. 3. Doe 1 fears that revealing her identity would subject her and her son to further harassment. Id. at 56. Third, requiring Doe 1 to reveal her identity would result in her not pursuing her claim and could chill future litigation by survivors of intimate partner violence. See id. at 78.Fourth, Doe 1's minor child is \"particularly vulnerable to the possible harms of disclosure,\" Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190, and protecting Doe 1's anonymity is necessary to protect the anonymity of her son. See, e.g., Smith v. Edwards, 175 F.3d 99, 99 n.1 (2d Cir. 1999) (using pseudonyms for the plaintiff and his family to protect the identity of his minor child); P.M. v. Evans-Brant Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 08-CV-168A, 2008 WL 4379490, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2008) (finding that \"the protection afforded to the minor would be eviscerated unless the parent was also permitted to proceed using initials\"). Fifth, \"the suit is challenging the actions of the government\" rather than \"that of private parties.\" Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190; EW v. N.Y. Blood Ctr., 213 F.R.D. 108, 111 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"[W]here a plaintiff attacks governmental activity, for example a governmental policy or statute, the plaintiff's interest in proceeding anonymously is considered particularly strong.\"). Sixth, there is no risk of prejudice to the defendant because Doe 1 is willing to disclose her identity to the defendant. See Doe 1's Mem. of Law at 9, Dkt. 3.Seventh, Doe 1's identity has thus far remained confidential. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190. Further, there is a weaker public interest in knowing Doe 1's identity because this is a putative class action. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190; EW, 213 F.R.D. at 111 (\"[I]n a class action context challenging governmental action, the individual defendant's personal characteristics (such as credibility) are generally not in issue.\"). And finally, there is no alternative means of preserving Doe 1's anonymity. See Sealed Plaintiff, 537 F.3d at 190.In light of the numerous factors that support Doe 1's application, the Court grants Doe 1's motion to proceed under a pseudonym (Dkt. 2). Ordered by Judge James R. Cho on September 6, 2024. (THB) Modified on 9/8/2024 (JDP)."

One night, without warning, a mother in New York City hears a knock on the door. \nHer children are home with her. The family is cooking, or playing, or sleeping. \n2.  When the  mother opens the door, two government investigators are standing \noutside, loudly demanding to be let inside. She is surprised and confused. She asks what this is \nabout. The investigators command the mother. You have to let us in. We need to look in your home. \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 2 of 49 PageID #: 2\n \nWe donโt need a warrant. Weโre going to get the police here if you refuse. Weโre not leaving until \nwe come inside. If you donโt let us in, weโre going to take your children.  \n3.  The mother has no choice, it seems. Terrified, she reluctantly opens the door and \nsteps aside, and the investigators walk into her home. It is clear that there is no present danger to \nanyone in the home, but still the investigators search the home top to bottom. They look inside \nmedicine cabinets, under beds, in closets and dresser drawers, in the refrigerator, and in cupboards. \nThe mother does not know why this is happening. The children are scared by these strangers \ncombing through their home. \n4.  The investigators demand to see the childrenโs bodies under their clothes. They tell \nthe mother to leave them alone in a room with her children. The investigators command the \nchildren. Lift up your shirt. Pull down your pants. I need to see your chest, your legs, your back. \nThe children are afraid, but they comply. Their mother cannot protect them from these strangers. \nThe mother fears that if she does not acquiesce to the investigatorsโ demands, they will take her \nchildren at any moment. Her fear is reasonable; the investigators are telling her that might happen. \n5.  The investigators leave as abruptly as they arrived. They have threatened to return, \neven though they found no evidence that the children are in danger. There seem to be no rules and \nno laws to protect the mother and her children from this intrusion.  \n*  *  * \n6.  The City of New Yorkโs Administration for Childrenโs Services (โACSโ) conducts \nthis kind of invasive and traumatic entry and search inside familiesโ homes more than 50,000 times \na year. That means every day well over 100 New York City families experience this harrowing \nviolation.  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 3 of 49 PageID #: 3\n \n7.  As part of its routine investigations into families, ACS has a widespread custom, \npolicy, and practice of entering and searching familiesโ homes by using coercive tactics (the \nโCoercive Tacticsโ) to make parents feel that they have no choice but to allow caseworkers to enter \nand search their homes. For example, ACS caseworkers lie to parents about their rights, threaten to \ncall the police, and even threaten to take the parentsโ children away if the caseworkers are not \npermitted to enter and search the home. ACS conducts the overwhelming majority of these entries \nand searches without a court order, without voluntary consent, and in the absence of any emergency. \n8.  During  these  searches,  ACS  routinely  rummages  through  entire  homes  and \nconducts untrammeled inspections of familiesโ most private spaces. ACS performs these sprawling \nsearches irrespective of whether these intimate spaces have any connection to whatever allegations \nhave been made about that particular family. \n9.  These coerced searches rarely result in determinations that the children require any \nprotection. Less than 7% of investigations lead ACS to file petitions in Family Court alleging that \nparents committed wrongdoing of any kind. \n10.  Nor do these coerced searches enhance child safety. As ACS has acknowledged, \ndata from the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic show that there is no increase in child \nmaltreatment when ACS drastically reduces the number of home entries and searches. \n11.  The trauma inflicted by ACS predominantly and disproportionately falls on Black \nand Hispanic families. More than 80% of the parents and children subjected to ACS investigations \nare Black or Hispanic. One out of every two Black children in New York City has been subjected \nto an ACS investigation by the time they reach the age of 18. ACS has acknowledged the racial \n  3 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 4 of 49 PageID #: 4\n \nimpact of its investigationsโan ACS-commissioned report describes a โpredatory system that \nspecifically targets Black and Brown parents.โ1  \n12.  ACSโs widespread use of the Coercive Tactics to enter and search familiesโ homes \nviolates the Fourth Amendment. There are three ways caseworkers may search a familyโs home to \nconduct investigations consistent with the Fourth Amendment: (1) obtain a court order, (2) act upon \nexigent circumstances that require an immediate search of the home, or (3) obtain voluntary \nconsent. Warrantless home searches like those ACS conducts tens of thousands of times a year are \nโpresumptively unreasonable.โ Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 559 (2004) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n13.  Under the New York Family Court Act, ACS has the ability โat all hoursโ to obtain \ncourt orders to enter and search familiesโ homes.2 These orders must be supported by โprobable \ncauseโ and โspecify which action may be taken and by whom.โ3  \n14.  ACS chooses to almost never seek these court orders. Across the nearly 53,000 \ninvestigations ACS conducted last year, it sought only 222 court orders to search familiesโ homes. \nEven assuming ACS completed only one home search during each investigation (it typically \nconducts several), ACS sought court orders for just 0.4% of home entries. This means over 99.5% \nof  home  searches  that  ACS  conducts  are  โpresumptively  unreasonableโ  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment. \n \n1   Antwuan Wallace et al., New York City Administration for Childrenโs Services Racial Equity \nParticipatory  Action  Research  &  System  Audit:  Findings  and  Opportunities,  National \nInnovation Service 14 (Dec. 2020) (draft report,) https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/draft-\nreport-of-nyc-administration-for-children-s-services-racial-equity-\nsurvey/fc3e7ced070e17a4/full.pdf [hereinafter, Racial Equity Report]. \n2   N.Y.

ACS rarely attempts to justify its warrantless home searches by relying on exigent \ncircumstances. Of course, ACS can enter familiesโ homes without a court order or consent when it \nhas grounds to believe a child is in imminent danger. But this case is not about the thankfully \ninfrequent emergencies when warrantless searches are necessary to protect a childโs safety. This \ncase is about the overwhelming majority of ACSโs more than 50,000 warrantless home searches \nevery yearโaffecting more than 90,000 children and 70,000 caretakersโwhere no emergency \ngrounds exist, even assuming the allegations under investigation are true. These allegations are \ntypically non-urgent and frequently involve common occurrences, such as a child missing school \nwithout a doctorโs note, a child seen playing in a hallway, or a parent disagreeing with a schoolโs \nrecommendation for special education services. \n16.  In the absence of exigent circumstances, rather than seeking court orders, ACS \ncaseworkers frequently gain entry into and search familiesโ homes through coercion, untruths, and \nthreats. For instance, ACS caseworkers misrepresent and withhold information from parents about \ntheir rights, threaten to involve the police (i.e., government agents with the ability to use force), and \neven directly threaten to take parentsโ children away in order to improperly enter and search \nfamiliesโ homes. Caseworkers routinely employ these Coercive Tactics multiple times during the \nsame investigation.  \n17.  ACSโs rampant use of the Coercive Tactics to conduct warrantless home searches \nis well known to Defendant City of New York. These practices have been meticulously documented \nby ACSโs own internal reports, the agencyโs staff, and the informational materials ACS provides to \nparents, as well as by academics, reports and testimony of advocates and investigated parents, and \nin several prior lawsuits.  \n  5 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 6 of 49 PageID #: 6\n \n18.  Nonetheless,  ACS  fails  to  provide  anything  close  to  adequate  training  to  its \ncaseworkers about familiesโ Fourth Amendment rights during home searches. Instead of ensuring \nthat its staff follows the law, ACS has created and continues to foster a regime of coerced \nacquiescence by using tactics that inculcate fear in parents that unless they cede to ACSโs demands, \ntheir children will be taken. Indeed, an ACS internal report describes how the agency creates \npernicious incentives for caseworkers to โbe invasive and not tell parents their rights.โ4 \n19.  Plaintiffs are nine parents who were subjected to ACSโs Coercive Tactics. These \nCoercive Tactics misled and intimidated Plaintiffs into believing they had no choice but to permit \nACSโs warrantless home entries and searches in non-exigent circumstances. ACS deployed an array \nof Coercive Tactics over the course of the numerous home searches experienced by Plaintiffs: ACS \nthreatened to take Plaintiffsโ children away if they did not let ACS into their homes; ACS threatened \nto call the police if Plaintiffs refused consent to entry; ACS told Plaintiffs the searches were \nโrequiredโ or that ACS โneededโ to search their homes; ACS abused and misrepresented its \nauthority; ACS did not meaningfully inform Plaintiffs of their rights to refuse, limit, or revoke \nconsent for ACSโs home searches; and ACS made public scenes at Plaintiffsโ front doors to \nintimidate Plaintiffs into letting them in.  \n20.  Plaintiffsโ experiences are not isolated or unusual. They are consistent with and \nindicative of ACSโs widespread and customary practice of deploying highly Coercive Tactics to \nconduct warrantless searches of familiesโ homes in non-exigent circumstances in violation of the \nFourth Amendment.  \n21.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, bring this lawsuit \nto end these unconstitutional and unconscionable wrongs. \n \n4  Racial Equity Report, supra note 1, at 18.  \n  6 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 7 of 49 PageID #: 7\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.  This  Court  has  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiffsโ  claims  pursuant  to \n28 U.S.C.  ยงยง  1331  and  1343(a),  as  this  action  seeks  redress  for  the  violation  of  Plaintiffsโ \nconstitutional and civil rights.  \n23.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the \nrights of the parties and to grant all further relief deemed necessary and proper. Rule 65 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes injunctive relief. This Court has authority to award \nattorneyโs fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988.  \n24.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1391(a) and (b) because \nDefendant City of New York resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred in the Eastern District of New York.  \nJURY DEMAND \n25.

ACS SEARCHES FAMILIESโ HOMES DURING NEARLY ALL OF ITS 50,000 \nINVESTIGATIONS EACH YEAR, WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY CONCLUDE \nWITHOUT ANY JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF WRONGDOING \n37.  ACS caseworkers7 search familiesโ homes during nearly every one of the more than \n50,000 investigations8 the agency conducts each year.  \n \n7   As used in this Complaint, โcaseworkersโ refers to ACS employees who work on, direct, \nmanage, or assist in ACSโs response to reports of child abuse and maltreatment. This includes, \nbut is not limited to, Child Protective Specialists Level I, Child Protective Specialists Level II, \nChild Protective Supervisors, Child Protective Managers, and other child protective and \ndiagnostic staff. \n8   As  used  in  this  Complaint,  โinvestigationsโ  includes  both  standard  investigations  and \ninvestigations  classified  as  Family  Assessment  Response  (โFARโ),  or  what  ACS  calls \nโCARES.โ Most ACS investigations go into the standard track.

During  these  searches,  ACS  caseworkers  routinely  examine  every  room  of \nfamiliesโ homes, rifle through their belongings, and in many cases search childrenโs bodies, all \nwithout regard to whether the scope of the searches has any relationship to the conduct being \ninvestigated.  \n39.  ACS investigations typically last 60 days and involve at least oneโand frequently \nmore than fourโinvasive searches of the familyโs home, and often include multiple intrusive, \ndistressing, and degrading strip-searches of the childrenโs bodies.  \n40.  ACS Commissioner Dannhauser has acknowledged the โinherently traumatic and \nintrusiveโ impact ACS investigations have on families.9 Parents10 are humiliated. Children must \nwatch as their parents are forced to acquiesce to strangers in their own homes who often demand \nthat the children disrobe and display their bodies.  \n41.  One  ACS  worker  described  the  experience  of  being  subjected  to  an  ACS \ninvestigation as โbeing stopped and frisked for sixty days.โ11  \n \nTactics to enter and search familiesโ homes.

ACS investigations are triggered by calls to the New York Statewide Central \nRegister of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (the โSCRโ), a centralized hotline operated by New \nYork Stateโs Office of Children and Family Services (โOCFSโ).12  \n43.  Anyone may call the hotline to lodge a report of child maltreatment for any reason. \nSome reports are made by mandated reporters. Others are made by members of the public, who \nmay make reports anonymously and without providing any identifying information or basis for their \nallegations.13  \n44.  Once ACS receives a report from the SCR about a family, the agency opens an \ninvestigation without further assessing the reliability and veracity of the allegations.14 \n45.  ACS Commissioner Dannhauser has acknowledged that many people โweaponiz[e] \nthe SCRโ through โfalse and malicious reporting,โ calling this a โreal problem.โ15  \n46.

For example, many abusive partners harass their victims by making repeated false \nand malicious reports to ACS.17  \nACS Conducts at Least One Home Search in Nearly All of Its Investigations \n48.  In 2023, ACS conducted 52,873 investigations into reports of suspected child abuse \nor neglect stemming from calls to the SCR.18  \n49.  Nearly 85% of allegations that gave rise to ACS investigations last year related \nsolely to child neglect rather than physical or sexual abuse.19  \n50.  An  overwhelming  number  of  ACSโs  indicators  of  child  neglectโsuch  as \ninadequate food/clothing/shelter20โare closely associated with conditions of poverty rather than \nparentsโ wrongdoing.21 \n51.

ACSโs Casework Practice Requirements Manual (the โCasework Manualโ), which \nprovides โuniform practice standardsโ for caseworkers, instructs caseworkers that they โmust visit \nthe homeโ and โassess the home environmentโ within 24 to 48 hours of the report to the SCR.23 \n53.  After the initial home search, ACS caseworkers routinely conduct additional home \nsearches throughout the investigation.24  \n54.  ACS requires at least bi-weekly home visits while an investigation is ongoing, \nmeaning ACS conducts an average of four to five home searches during each investigation.25 \nACSโs Home Searches Typically Include a Search of Every Room in Familiesโ Homes, Their \nPossessions, and Childrenโs Bodies \n55.  The Casework Manual provides that โ[a]ll rooms in the home must be examinedโ \nduring a home search, without regard to whether there is any reason to believe a particular room in \nthe home has evidence of the alleged abuse or neglect being investigated.26  \n56.  The Casework Manual sets out 20 separate aspects of the home that caseworkers \nmust evaluate during every home search, such as the refrigerator, sleeping arrangements, and paint \non the walls, without regard to whether the report to the SCR concerns any of those conditions.27 \n57.

In addition to searching the entire home, caseworkers routinely conduct searches of \nchildrenโs bodies, requiring children to lift up and pull down their clothes. \n59.   Searches of childrenโs bodies are routine, even though the vast majority of ACS \ninvestigations do not involve any allegation of physical mistreatment.29 \n60.  An October 13, 2022 report issued by ProPublica and NBC News (the โProPublica \nReportโ), which was based on interviews with โ[m]ore than two dozen caseworkers, parents, \nchildren and attorneys,โ found that ACS strip-searches children โdown to their underwearโ during \nโevery or nearly every initial home visit by the agency.โ30  \nMost ACS Investigations Conclude Without Any Determination of Wrongdoing \n61.

ACS closes an investigation as unfounded if ACS โdid not find enough evidence to \nsupport the claim that a child has been abused or neglected.โ32  \n63.  Even among those investigations that ACS does not close as unfounded, few lead \nto any case filed in court and even fewer to judicial findings of wrongdoing against the families \nsubject to the investigation.  \n64.  In 2022, less than 7% of all investigations led ACS to file abuse or neglect petitions \nagainst parents or other caretakers in Family Court.33  \n65.  Although  the  vast  majority  of  cases  close  without  any  judicial  finding  of \nwrongdoing, ACS routinely conducts multiple invasive home searches during each investigation \nwithout regard to whether the searches have any relationship to the allegations or the strength of \nthe evidence supporting them.  \n66.  These invasive searches do not increase child safety.

ACS MAINTAINS A WIDESPREAD POLICY, CUSTOM, AND PRACTICE OF \nCOERCING CONSENT TO SEARCH HOMES WITHOUT A COURT ORDER OR \nEXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES \n67.  Defendant City of New York knows that more than 50,000 times a year, ACS \ncaseworkers will enter and search the homes of families subject to the agencyโs investigations. \n68.  Caseworkers use the Coercive Tactics to carry out these entries and searches in \nnon-emergency circumstances instead of obtaining a court order or voluntary consent. \n69.  ACS  fails  to  provide  adequate  policies,  procedures,  training,  or  supervision \nregarding familiesโ Fourth Amendment rights with respect to home entries and searches. \nA.  ACS Maintains a Widespread Policy, Custom, and Practice of Using Highly \nCoercive Tactics to Enter and Search Familiesโ Homes \n70.  In order to legally conduct home searches in the absence of a court order or exigent \ncircumstances, ACS must receive voluntary consent to enter and search the home.36 \n71.  During tens of thousands of warrantless, non-exigent searches every year, ACS \ndoes not obtain voluntary consent to enter and search familiesโ homes. \n72.  To effectuate home entries and searches, ACS maintains a widespread custom, \npolicy, and practice of coercing parents into allowing ACS caseworkers to enter and search their \nhomes in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n73.  ACS uses a series of Coercive Tactics to enter and search familiesโ homes without \nobtaining voluntary consent: \n \n36   See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973); see also Southerland v. City of New \nYork, 680 F.3d 127, 143โ49 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that โplaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment \nunlawful-search claimsโ against ACS survived summary judgment); Tenenbaum v.

Cnty. of Orange, 894 \nF. Supp. 2d 345, 371โ72 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (holding that parents stated claim that ACS home \nsearch violated their Fourth Amendment right where they alleged lack of voluntary consent). \n  16 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 17 of 49 PageID #: 17\n \na.  ACS threatens to take parentsโ children away: ACS caseworkers tell or imply \nto parents that the agency will take their children away if they refuse to let ACS \nenter and search the home, even though the children are not in imminent danger \nof harm to justify such a removal.  \nb.  ACS threatens to call the police: ACS caseworkers tell parents ACS will call \nthe police to come to the familyโs home if the parents do not let them enter and \nsearch the home, even though there are not emergency circumstances that \nwould justify forcible, warrantless entry by the police. \nc.  ACS  tells  parents  they  have  no  choice:  Even when  there  are  no  exigent \ncircumstances, ACS caseworkers tell parents that they โmust,โ โneed to,โ โhave \nto,โ or โare required toโ let ACS enter and search their homes. \nd.  ACS  abuses  and  misrepresents  its  authority:  In  the  absence  of  exigent \ncircumstances, ACS caseworkers illegally seize and strip-search children and \nconvey to parents that ACS does not need a court order to enter and search the \nhome, creating the impression that parents do not have the choice to decline \nACSโs requests or resist ACSโs demands to conduct home searches. \ne.  ACS does not meaningfully inform parents of their rights: ACS caseworkers \nfrequently do not inform parents that they have the right to refuse, limit, and \nrevoke consent when ACS seeks to enter and search their homes without a court \norder and in the absence of exigent circumstances. When ACS caseworkers do \ninform parents of the right to refuse entry, they do so ineffectively.37 \n \n37   ACS recently announced a โpilot programโ in which caseworkers give certain parents a palm \ncard that says parents can โchoose not to let ACS into [their] homeโ but also falsely implies \nthat a home search is legally required and inevitable.

ACS makes a public scene: ACS caseworkers intentionally bang on front doors \nand announce their presence loudly enough so neighbors can see and hear, \npressuring parents to let them in or face the stigma of their neighbors learning \nthey are under ACS investigation. \n74.  ACSโs widespread use of these Coercive Tactics reflects a deliberate choice to \ndiscourage caseworkers from seeking court orders and instead to use coercion to enter and search \nfamiliesโ homes in non-exigent situations.  \n75.  The purpose of the Coercive Tactics is the same in every case: in non-exigent \ncircumstances, to coerce parents or caretakers into permitting ACS caseworkers to enter and search \ntheir homesโand often search their childrenโs bodiesโwithout having to go through the process \nof obtaining a court order or voluntary consent.  \nB.  ACSโs Use of Coercive Tactics to Enter Familiesโ Homes Is Well Documented \n76.  ACS knows about and is deliberately indifferent to the agencyโs widespread policy, \ncustom, and practice of using these Coercive Tactics to enter and search familiesโ homes. This \npractice has been extensively documented in (i) ACSโs own reports and informational materials, \n(ii) media and academic reports, (iii) parentsโ and advocatesโ legislative testimony, (iv) prior \nlawsuits, and (v) ACSโs statements. \n77.

[m]ake an unannounced visit to your home within 24-48 \nhours of the report,โ โmust see and speak with all your biological children living with you or with \nother caretakers,โ and โwill . . . [c]heck to make sure your home is free of hazards, has adequate \nfood, safe sleeping arrangements, etc.โ40  \n78.  By repeatedly using mandatory language such as โwillโ and โmust,โ ACS primes \nparents with the threat that being perceived as uncooperative risks family separation, misrepresents \nthe law, and preys on parentsโ primordial fear by sending a clear and unmistakable message that \nparents have no choice but to let ACS caseworkers conduct home searches during the agencyโs \ninvestigations.  \n79.  ACS directs parents who want โmore information about [their] rights if [they] are \nnamed in a report,โ to go to a link on the New York State Office of Child and Family Services \nwebsite.  \n80.  Nowhere on that website does it state that parents have the right to refuse, limit, or \nrevoke consent for entries and searches.41 \n \n38   N.Y.C. ADMIN. FOR CHILD.

Internal ACS Reports: ACSโs internal reports show that the agencyโs reliance on \nthe Coercive Tactics to gain entry into and search familiesโ homes goes back nearly two decades. \n82.  In a February 2007 joint report by ACS and the New York City Department of \nInvestigation (โDOIโ), ACS staff told DOI โthat they consider entry warrants to be an extreme \nremedy,โ and that supervisors instruct them to โattempt additional home entries before seeking any \nwarrants,โ even after parents refuse consent to entry.42 An ACS attorney interviewed for the DOI \nReport confirmed that ACS โrarely sought warrants of entry.โ43 \n83.  A 2020 ACS internal audit that included interviews with more than 50 caseworkers \nconcluded that ACS โincentivizes [caseworkers] to be invasive and not tell parents their rightsโ \nduring investigations.44  \n84.  Media and Academic Reports: ACS caseworkers and investigated parents have \ndescribed ACSโs rampant use of the Coercive Tactics in the media and in academic reports. \n85.  The 2022 ProPublica Report, which documented ACSโs long-standing practice of \nwarrantless home searches, concluded that โcaseworkers frequently say things that are coercive and \nmanipulative in order to get inside homes without going to a judge.โ45  \n86.

A former NYPD officerโnow a Professor at the John Jay College of Criminal \nJusticeโwho frequently received calls to assist ACS caseworkers expressed โamazement that \ncaseworkers could comb through whatever they wanted within a home as if they had a โblank checkโ \ninstead of a warrant.โ47 \n88.  A 2021 report from the NYU Wagner School of Public Policy also highlights \nACSโs use of the Coercive Tactics. The report describes how ACS routinely โdemands access to \nthe home without a court orderโ; caseworkers โoften provide . . . misinformation to parents about \nthe scope of the governmentโs power in order to gain access to the homeโ; and caseworkers \nโregularly tell parents that if they fail to cooperate with their demands, their children will be \nremoved,โ even though โNew York law is clear that, absent a true emergency, ACS cannot enter a \nhome and interview children without a court order or a parentโs permission.โ48 \n89.  In an interview with New York One, an ACS caseworker acknowledged that the \nCoercive Tactics prey on familiesโ fears about ACS investigations, explaining that a knock on the \nfront door from ACS instills โa lot of fearโ because parents are terrified that ACS is โcoming in to \nremove the children.โ49 \n \n46  Id.  \n47  Id. \n48  Parent Legis.

Testimony from Parents and Advocates: Parents who have been investigated by \nACS and family advocates have testified to the New York City Council and New York State \nLegislature regarding ACSโs widespread use of the Coercive Tactics during hearings on currently \npending legislation at the City and State levels that would require ACS to inform families of various \nrights, including the right not to consent to a home search, when ACS arrives at the door at the \noutset of an investigation. \n91.  The proposed, pending legislation is a direct response to ACSโs widespread use of \nthe Coercive Tactics. A Sponsor Memo for the New York State Senateโs version of the bill describes \nhow families โare pressured to allow CPS caseworkers into their home without full knowledge of \ntheir legal rights,โ including under false threats that their children will be removed if they do not \nlet caseworkers in.50 \n92.  At a City Council hearing, one parent described how ACS โpush[es] their way into \nyour homeโ by โbringing the police into your homeโ and threatening to remove children if consent \nis refused.51 \n93.  At  a  State  Assembly  hearing,  another  parent  explained  that  ACS  โmak[es] \nunexpected visits to the parent[sโ] homes, banging on our doors and threatening the parents and \nfrightening our children at all times of the day and night.โ52 \n \n50  N.Y.S.

An attorney leading the family defense practice of a public defender office in New \nYork City, who has substantial experience representing parents subjected to ACS investigations, \nsimilarly testified to the State Assembly about how caseworkers โuse misinformation and the threat \nof family separation and police involvement to coerce vulnerable families to relinquish their \nconstitutional rights before a court is even involved.โ53 \n95.  Prior Lawsuits: Numerous prior lawsuits have alleged that ACS used the Coercive \nTactics to enter and search familiesโ homes. See, e.g., Complaint, L.B. v. City of New York, et al., \nNo. 23 Civ. 8501 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2023) (in non-exigent circumstances, caseworkers used \nmultiple Coercive Tactics including arriving with law enforcement, telling a mother she was \nrequired to let them in, and telling a mother that letting caseworkers in was the only way to stop \nACS visits); First Amended Complaint ยถยถ 49โ52, Ferguson v.

ACSโs Statements: ACS Commissioner Dannhauser has repeatedly acknowledged \nthe importance of families under ACS investigation being notified of their right to deny ACS \ncaseworkers entry into their homes.54 \n97.  The Commissioner has further recognized that Black and Hispanic families face a \ngreater risk of coercion because โit is more likely that a white family will close the door and call a \nlawyer, or certainly a family with means will do that. And so, we want to make sure that families \nknow their rights.โ55 \nC.  ACS  Overwhelmingly  Fails  to  Seek  Court  Orders  to  Enter  and  Search \nFamiliesโ Homes Despite the Availability of a Clear Process to Obtain Them \n98.  ACS has intentionally chosen to use the Coercive Tactics although a readily \navailable legal procedure exists for obtaining a court order to enter and search familiesโ homes.  \n99.  The New York Family Court Act establishes a clear process that is โavailable at all \nhoursโ of the day for caseworkers to obtain court orders (โEntry Ordersโ) to authorize home entries \nand searches in the absence of parental consent. Caseworkers can seek these orders in person, in \nwriting, or by phone.56 \n100.  The procedure for ACS to obtain Entry Orders under the Family Court Act is โthe \nsame as for a search warrant under article six hundred ninety of the criminal procedure law.โ57  \n \n54   See Jess Dannhauser & Anne Williams-Isom, Protecting children & protecting their families, \nDAILY NEWS (Dec. 15, 2022), https://www.nydailynews.com/2022/12/15/protecting-children-\nprotecting-their-families/;  Chatodd  Floyd,  N.Y.C.

As the Second Circuit explained in a New York City case, in ACS โinvestigations, \na  Family  Court  order  is  equivalent  to  a  search  warrant  for  Fourth  Amendment  purposes.โ \nSoutherland v. City of New York, 680 F.3d 127, 144 n.15 (2d Cir. 2012). \n102.  ACS may obtain an Entry Order only โwhere there is probable cause to believe that \nan abused or neglected child may be found on the premisesโ to which entry is sought.58  \n103.  Family courts may only grant Entry Orders that are โnecessaryโ in light of the \nchildrenโs safety and may only authorize actions that are โthe least intrusive to the family.โ  \n104.  To issue an Entry Order, family courts must weigh factors including โthe nature or \nseriousness of the allegations,โ โthe potential harm to the child or childrenโ absent the search, the \nreliability of the report to the SCR, and the strength of the evidence supporting it.59  \n105.  Despite clear standards and an available process to obtain Entry Orders at all hours \nof the day, ACS virtually never seeks Entry Orders to authorize the home entries and searches it \nconducts as part of nearly every investigation.  \n106.  In 2023, ACS sought Entry Orders in just 0.4% of its investigations. It conducted \n52,873 investigations and made just 222 applications for Entry Orders.60  \n107.  ACSโs practice of failing to seek Entry Orders in virtually all of its investigations \nis long-standing:  \n \n58  Id. ยง 1034(2)(b)(i). \n59  See id. ยงยง 1034(2)(d) and (e). \n60  Jan. 2024 Monthly Indicators Report, supra note 8, at 7; N.Y.C.

The Overwhelming Majority of ACS Investigations Do Not Involve Imminent \nDanger to a Child to Justify Warrantless Home Entries and Searches Without \nConsent  \n108.  ACS does not require staff to assess or document whether there are emergency \ncircumstances to justify a warrantless home search at the time they demand to enter and search a \nhome.  \n109.  While ACS does not document assertions of exigent circumstances to justify a \nwarrantless home search at the time its caseworkers demand to enter and search a home, ACS does \nclaim exigent circumstances as the basis to remove children without a court order in 1.5% of \ninvestigations.65  \n110.  As  ACS  obtains  a  court  order  for  a  home  search  in  less  than  0.5%  of  its \ninvestigations, in more than 99.5% of its investigations, the agency searches familiesโ homes \nwithout a court order or claimed exigent circumstances.  \nE.  ACS Fails to Adequately Train or Supervise Its Caseworkers About Parentsโ \nFourth Amendment Rights During Home Entries and Searches \n111.  ACS  provides  inadequate  training  and  supervision  to  caseworkers  regarding \nparentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during home entries and searches, even though it knows \ncaseworkers will seek to enter and search familiesโ homes during nearly every single one of the \nagencyโs more than 50,000 investigations every year.  \n112.  The ACS Casework Manual, which delineates the practice standards caseworkers \nmust follow during investigations, fails to give caseworkers adequate guidance or instructions \n \n65   In these cases, ACS asserts in an attachment to the court petitions that children were in \nimminent danger justifying emergency removal prior to any court hearing. ACS removed 1,369 \nchildren on an alleged emergency basis in 2022. 2022 Child Welfare Indicators Annual \nReport, supra note 61, at 17. This represents 1.5% of children subject to an ACS investigation \nthat year. N.Y.C. ADMIN. FOR CHILD.

The Casework Manual provides inadequate guidance and instructions regarding \n(i) the circumstances under which caseworkers may enter and search familiesโ homes without a \nwarrant; (ii) the distinction between exigent and non-exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless \nhome entry; and (iii) the meaning of obtaining โvoluntary consentโ to enter and search the home or \nguidance on the sorts of Coercive Tactics that would vitiate voluntary consent.68  \n115.  The Casework Manual does not adequately inform caseworkers that parents have \nthe right to decline or limit consent or to revoke previously given consent for ACS to enter and \nsearch the home in the absence of a court order authorizing the search or exigent circumstances.69  \n116.  The Casework Manual does not adequately train caseworkers to inform parents of \ntheir rights before entering and searching their homes, leading caseworkers to systematically \nneglect to give parents that information. \n117.  Instead, the Casework Manual instructs caseworkers only to โ[m]ake [a] referral to \n[ACSโs legal counsel] to obtain an entry order or warrant if needed.โ70 \n \n66  See Casework Manual, supra note 23, at 20โ23. \n67   Id. \n68   Id. \n69   Id. \n70   Id. at 21. \n  28 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 29 of 49 PageID #: 29\n \n118.

At the same time, the Casework Manual instructs caseworkers to search โ[a]ll \nroomsโ  in  the  home  and  โ[a]ssess/describe/documentโ  20  different  aspects  of  the  home \nenvironment, such as โpeeling paintโ and โheavy traffic of adults in the home,โ without regard to \nwhether the conduct being investigated has anything to do with those conditions.72 \n120.  ACSโs  other  training  materials  instruct  caseworkers  that  when  โa  parent  or \ncaretaker blocks [the caseworkerโs] access to seeing and interviewing a child[,]โ caseworkers โmust \nbe insistentโ in โpresenting [their] authority as an ACS investigator to a parent/caretakerโ in order \nto โaccess that child(ren).โ73 \n121.  ACSโs failure to provide caseworkers with adequate training regarding familiesโ \nFourth Amendment rights with respect to home searches falls far short of other agencies that \nregularly conduct home searches, such as the New York City Police Department (โNYPDโ). Unlike \nACS, the NYPD uses training materials that reference the requirements of the Fourth Amendment \nwith respect to home searches and specifically instruct officers that consent to enter and consent to \nsearch must be obtained voluntarily without coercion.74 The NYPDโs training materials further \n \n71  ProPublica Report, supra note 30.  \n72  Casework Manual, supra note 23, at 20. \n73  N.Y.C.

The absence of adequate training and supervision ACS provides to caseworkers \nregarding Fourth Amendment rights during home searches demonstrates a deliberate choice by the \nagency to encourage caseworkersโ widespread use of the Coercive Tactics to force their way into \nand search familiesโ homes without a court order. It also reflects the agencyโs stated positionโin \nbrazen disregard of binding Second Circuit precedentโthat the Fourth Amendment does not apply \nto ACS.77 \n \n75   Id. \n76   The NYPDโs Consent to Search form (1) requires the person write their identifying information \nand what is permitted to be searched; (2) alerts that the purpose of the search is to discover \nโevidence, or contrabandโ; (3) requires the person to โhave been advised of [their] right to \nrefuse consent before any search is conductedโ; (4) requires the person to agree that they \nunderstand their right to revoke consent โin whole or in part, at anytimeโ; (5) requires the \nperson to agree they are consenting โknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently and without \nthreats or promises of any kindโ; (6) requires the person to sign and date the form; and (7) \nrequires names and identifying information from the officer, a witness, and a supervisor. \nNYPD Consent to Search Form, PD 541-030 (Rev. 10-16) (on file with Plaintiffsโ counsel). \n77   Compare  ProPublica  Report,  supra  note  30  at 7  (reporting that  ACS  officials  โdrew  a \ndistinction between their work and what police do, saying that the Fourth Amendment applies \nonly to the criminal justice system and that entry orders are categorically different from search \nwarrantsโ) with Southerland v.

ACS USED THE COERCIVE TACTICS TO ENTER AND SEARCH PLAINTIFFSโ \nHOMES \nA.  The Gould Family  \n123.  Between May 2021 and May 2023, ACS used the Coercive Tactics to conduct at \nleast 12 warrantless, non-exigent searches of Ebony Gouldโs home.  \n124.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Gould Family home and \nconduct the warrantless, non-exigent searches, including: (1) deceptively stating that the searches \nwere mandatory and that it was โprotocolโ for ACS to enter the home; (2) threatening that if ACS \nwas not given access to the home, they would have to come back with authorities, and subsequently \nreturning with law enforcement; (3) threatening that if ACS was not given access to the home they \nwould take her children away; (4) banging on her door and her neighborsโ doors and speaking with \nher neighbors; and (5) failing to inform or advise Ms. Gould that she had the right not to permit \nACS to enter and search the home or that she could limit or revoke her consent. \n125.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Gould to reasonably believe she had \nno choice but to allow ACS to enter and search her home each time. \n126.  During the home searches ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched every room in Ms. Gouldโs home. \n127.  ACS also strip-searched N.G., X.D., and G.D. without a court order authorizing the \nsearches and without any signs of physical abuse. N.G. was between sixteen and eighteen years old, \nX.D. was between six and eight years old, and G.D. was between four and six years old at the time \nof these searches. \n128.  ACS conducted each search of the Gould Familyโs home without a court order, \nwithout voluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances. \n129.  ACS conducted these invasive investigations in response to allegations of neglect.  \n  31 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 32 of 49 PageID #: 32\n \n130.  On or around May 4, 2023, ACS closed the most recent investigation of Ms. Gould. \nHer children were never removed, no court case was ever filed, and the investigations were \nultimately unfounded. \n131.  ACSโs  invasive  and  unconstitutional  searches  of  Ms.  Gouldโs  home  caused \nMs. Gould and her children to suffer severe trauma that remains with them today.  \nB.  The Taylor Family \n132.  Between September 2022 and November 2022, ACS used the Coercive Tactics to \nconduct at least five warrantless, non-exigent searches of Curtayasia Taylorโs home. \n133.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Taylor Family home and \nconduct the warrantless, non-exigent searches, including: (1) deceptively stating that the searches \nwere required by law, including that ACS โneeded toโ check the apartment and that Ms. Taylor had \nno choice but to comply; (2) threatening to take Ms. Taylorโs children from her custody, stating \nthat if she refused to permit access to the home ACS would get a court order to remove the children; \n(3) repeatedly and aggressively threatening to return to Ms. Taylorโs home with law enforcement \nin order to take the children; and (4) failing to inform or advise Ms. Taylor that she had the right \nnot to permit ACS to enter and search the home or that she could limit or revoke her consent. \n134.  ACS went so far as to tell Ms. Taylor that her children were โno longer [her] \nchildrenโ and, instead, clients of ACS to whom she could not talk without ACSโs permission. \n135.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Taylor to reasonably believe she had \nno choice but to allow ACS to enter and search her home.  \n136.  During the home searches ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nrepeatedly  searched  throughout  Ms.  Taylorโs  home,  including  the  kitchen,  the  cabinets,  the \nrefrigerator, the closets, and under the beds. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 33 of 49 PageID #: 33\n \n137.  ACS also strip-searched A.V. without a court order authorizing the search and \nwithout any signs of physical abuse. A.V. was six years old at the time of this search. \n138.  ACS conducted each search of the Taylor Familyโs home without a court order, \nwithout voluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances. \n139.  ACS conducted this invasive investigation in response to an allegation of neglect. \n140.  On or around November 29, 2022, ACS closed the investigation into Ms. Taylor. \nHer children were never removed, no court case was ever filed, and the investigation was ultimately \nunfounded.  \n141.  ACSโs  invasive  and  unconstitutional  searches  of  Ms.  Taylorโs  home  caused \nMs. Taylor and her children to suffer severe trauma that remains with them today.  \nC.  The Warmington Family \n142.  Between April 2021 and June 2021, ACS used the Coercive Tactics to conduct at \nleast four warrantless, non-exigent searches of Plaintiff Shavona Warmingtonโs home. \n143.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Warmington Family home \nand conduct the warrantless, non-exigent searches, including (1) falsely stating that the searches \nwere required by law, including that ACS โneedsโ to come in and telling Ms. Warmington she had \nto let them in; (2) threatening that if Ms. Warmington did not let ACS into her home, ACS would \nhave to bring the police; (3) banging loudly on her door so the neighbors could hear; and (4) failing \nto inform or advise Ms. Warmington that she had the right not to permit ACS to enter and search \nthe home or that she could limit or revoke her consent. \n144.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Warmington to reasonably believe she \nhad no choice but to allow ACS to enter and search her home. \n145.  During the home searches ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched every room of Ms. Warmingtonโs home and rifled through her refrigerator, kitchen \n  33 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 34 of 49 PageID #: 34\n \ncabinets, and closets. \n146.  ACS also strip-searched L.B., P.W., and E.W. without a court order authorizing the \nsearches and without any signs of physical abuse. L.B. was eight years old, P.W. was six years old, \nand E.W. was approximately one year old at the time of these searches. \n147.  ACS conducted each search of the Warmington Familyโs home without a court \norder, without voluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances. \n148.  ACS conducted the invasive investigation in response to an allegation of neglect. \n149.  On or around June 3, 2021, ACS closed its investigation into Ms. Warmington. Her \nchildren were never removed, no court case was ever filed, and the investigation was ultimately \nunfounded. \n150.  ACSโs invasive and unconstitutional searches of Ms. Warmingtonโs home caused \nMs. Warmington and her children to suffer severe trauma that remains with them today.  \nD.  The Hackett Family \n151.  In  July  2021,  ACS  used  the  Coercive  Tactics  to  conduct  one  warrantless, \nnon-exigent search of Shalonda Curtis-Hackett and Christopher Hackettโs home.  \n152.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Hackett Family home and \nconduct the warrantless, non-exigent search, including: (1) deceptively stating that the search was \nmandatory and that they had no option but to let ACS enter the home; (2) threatening that if ACS \nwas not given access to the home, ACS would have to come with the police; and (3) failing to \ninform or advise the Hacketts that they had the right not to permit ACS to enter and search the home \nor that they could limit or revoke their consent. \n153.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led the Hacketts to reasonably believe they \nhad no choice but to allow ACS to enter and search their home. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 35 of 49 PageID #: 35\n \n154.  During the home search ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched every room in the Hackettsโ apartment. \n155.  ACS conducted the search of the Hackett Familyโs home without a court order, \nwithout voluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances. \n156.  ACS conducted this invasive investigation in response to an allegation of neglect. \n157.  On or around July 20, 2021, ACS closed the investigation. The children were never \nremoved, no court case was ever filed, and the investigation was not ultimately indicated.78  \n158.  ACSโs  invasive  and  unconstitutional  search  of  the  Hackettsโ  home  caused \nMs. Curtis-Hackett, Mr. Hackett, and their children to suffer severe trauma that remains with them \ntoday.  \nE.  The Azar-Eng Family  \n159.  Between May 2022 and July 2022, ACS used the Coercive Tactics to conduct three \nwarrantless, non-exigent searches of Plaintiffs Marianna Azar and Mathew Engโs home.  \n160.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Azar-Eng Family home and \nconduct the warrantless, non-exigent searches including: (1) falsely stating that the searches were \nrequired by law, including that ACS โneedsโ to access the home andโin response to Ms. Azar \nasking for a warrantโthat โthe agency does not need a warrant or court order to complete a visitโ; \nand (2) failing to inform or advise Ms. Azar and Mr. Eng that they had the right not to permit ACS \n \n78   The Hackett Familyโs case was designated a FAR investigation. See supra note 8. FAR \ninvestigations  do  not  result  in  a  culpability  determination.  However,  caseworkers  must \nโconstantly assess[] safety and riskโ during FAR investigations, and โ[i]f, while working with \na family, a FAR caseworker had serious concerns about the immediate safety of a child, the \nchild protective service would have to open [a standard] investigation and stop using FAR.โ \nOFF.  OF  CHILD.  AND  FAM.  SERVS.,  Family  Assessment  Response, \nhttps://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/cps/assessment-response.php (last visited Feb. 17, 2024). Thus, \nthat ACS never opened a standard investigation into the Hackett Family demonstrates that the \nFAR investigation did not reveal safety concerns, akin to an unfounded standard investigation. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 36 of 49 PageID #: 36\n \nto enter and search the home or that they could limit or revoke their consent. \n161.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Azar and Mr. Eng to reasonably \nbelieve they had no choice but to allow ACS to enter and search their home.  \n162.  During the home searches ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched every room of the Azar-Eng Familyโs home and rifled through the familyโs refrigerator, \nkitchen cabinets, and closets. \n163.  ACS also strip-searched Y.A. without a court order authorizing the search and \nwithout any signs of physical abuse. Y.A. was five years old at the time of this search. \n164.  ACS conducted each search of the Azar-Eng Familyโs home without a court order, \nwithout voluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances.  \n165.  ACS conducted this invasive investigation in response to an allegation of neglect. \n166.  On or around July 26, 2022, ACS closed the investigation. Their daughter was \nnever removed, no court case was ever filed, and the investigation was ultimately unfounded.  \n167.  ACSโs invasive and unconstitutional searches of the Azar-Engโs home caused \nMs. Azar, Mr. Eng, and Y.A. to suffer severe trauma that remains with them today.  \nF.  The Doe 1 Family \n168.  Between May 2021 and August 2022, ACS used the Coercive Tactics to conduct at \nleast two warrantless, non-exigent searches of Jane Doe 1โs home.  \n169.  ACS used the Coercive Tactics to gain entry into the Doe 1 Family home and \nconduct the warrantless, non-exigent searches, including: (1) threatening Ms. Doe 1 with the use of \nlaw enforcement if she did not allow ACS into her home; (2) implying that the searches were \nrequired by law; and (3) failing to inform or advise Ms. Doe 1 that she had the right not to permit \nACS to enter and search the home or that she could limit or revoke her consent. \n170.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Doe 1 to reasonably believe she had \n  36 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 37 of 49 PageID #: 37\n \nno choice but to allow ACS to enter and search her home.  \n171.  During the home searches ACS executed pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched every room of Ms. Doe 1โs home and rifled through her cabinets and refrigerator.  \n172.  ACS also strip-searched A.D.1 multiple times without a court order authorizing the \nsearches and without any allegations or signs of physical abuse. A.D.1 was between five and six \nyears old at the time of these searches. \n173.  ACS conducted each search of Ms. Doe 1โs home without a court order, without \nvoluntary consent, and without exigent circumstances. \n174.  ACS conducted the invasive investigations in response to allegations of neglect.  \n175.  In or around August 2022, ACS closed the most recent investigation into Ms. \nDoe 1. Her child was never removed, no court case was ever filed, and the investigations were \nultimately unfounded. \n176.  ACSโs invasive and unconstitutional searches of Ms. Doe 1โs home caused Ms. \nDoe 1 and A.D.1 to suffer severe trauma that remains with them today.  \nG.  The Doe 2 Family  \n177.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 2 is currently the subject of an active ACS investigation. \n178.  In January 2024, as part of this ongoing investigation, ACS used the Coercive \nTactics to conduct a warrantless, non-exigent search of Ms. Doe 2โs home, including (1) abusing \nand misrepresenting its authority by telling Ms. Doe 2 that ACS was going to take away her children \nbefore searching her home; and (2) failing to inform or advise Ms. Doe 2 that she had the right not \nto permit ACS to search the home or that she could limit or revoke her consent.  \n179.  ACSโs use of these Coercive Tactics led Ms. Doe 2 to reasonably believe she had \nno choice but to allow ACS to search her home. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 38 of 49 PageID #: 38\n \n180.  During the home search ACS conducted pursuant to these Coercive Tactics, ACS \nsearched Ms. Doe 2โs childrenโs bedrooms and her kitchen. \n181.  ACS conducted this home search without a court order, without voluntary consent, \nand without exigent circumstances. \n182.  Prior to ACSโs home search, Ms. Doe 2โs husband asked if the family should retain \na lawyer. ACS answered, โno.โ \n183.  Prior to conducting this home search, ACS threatened to take Ms. Doe 2โs children \nfrom her care and illegally seized her children without a court order, without voluntary consent, and \nwithout a basis to believe the children were in imminent risk of harm in her care. \n184.  After ACS illegally seized Ms. Doe 2โs children, it took them to a separate location \nas part of its investigation. ACS returned Ms. Doe 2โs children to her care a few hours later. \n185.  Ms. Doe 2 is Spanish-speaking and has limited English proficiency. The ACS \ncaseworkers who came to her home spoke to her in English. They used a telephone translator for \nsome but not all of their interaction.  \n186.  ACS has continued throughout the investigation to communicate with Ms. Doe 2 \nin English even though they know she has limited English proficiency.  \n187.  After conducting the home search and illegally seizing and then returning her \nchildren, ACS stated that it would return to the home with and without notice. \n188.  ACS has not filed a court case against Ms. Doe 2, and her children are living with \nher and her husband today.  \n189.  ACSโs invasive and unconstitutional search of Ms. Doe 2โs home caused Ms. Doe 2 \nand her family to suffer severe trauma. \n  38 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 39 of 49 PageID #: 39\n \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO BE SUBJECTED TO ACSโS COERCIVE TACTICS \nAGAIN IN THE FUTURE \n190.  All Plaintiffs are likely to be subjected to ACSโs Coercive Tactics again in the near \nfuture. \n191.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 2 is likely to face such Coercive Tactics within the next month. \n192.  ACS is likely to conduct additional coerced searches of Plaintiff Jane Doe 2โs home \nwithin the next monthโduring its currently active 60-day investigationโbecause ACS typically \nconducts several home searches during investigations and ACS stated that it would return to her \nhome after the first coerced home search. \n193.  Plaintiffs who do not have active investigations are likewise likely to be subjected \nto the Coercive Tactics again. Families who are subjected to an ACS investigation once are likely \nto face more ACS investigations in the near future, often many times over.  \n194.  Twenty-five percent of children who are subjects of ACS investigations will be \nsubjects of another investigation within one year.79 In 2022, 50% of reports to the SCR concerned \na parent or guardian who had been reported to the SCR at least once in the previous two years.80 \n195.  Plaintiffs have all been subject to at least one ACS investigation. \n196.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to face additional investigations in the near future \nduring which ACS caseworkers will again use the Coercive Tactics to enter and search their homes.  \n197.  The fact that a family is subjected to repeated ACS investigations does not mean \nthere is a greater likelihood that a child is in danger of neglect or abuse.  \n \n79  N.Y.C.  ADMIN.  CHILD.

For instance, Plaintiffs Gould, Warmington, and Doe 1 were all subject to numerous \nACS investigations because abusive ex-partners made false and malicious reports against them.  \na.  Ms. Gould has been subject to twelve unfounded ACS investigations since \nMarch  2020  generated  by  false  and  malicious  reports  from  her  abusive \nex-partner.  \nb.  Ms. Warmington has been subject to ten unfounded ACS investigations since \nDecember 2012 generated by false and malicious reports from her abusive \nex-partner.  \nc.  Ms. Doe 1 has been subject to six unfounded ACS investigations since April \n2019 generated by false and malicious reports from her abusive ex-partner.  \n199.  ACS did not alter its use of the Coercive Tactics to conduct invasive warrantless \nhome searches of these Plaintiffs even after the agency had a documented track record of false \nreports against them.  \n200.  Families in high-poverty neighborhoods are four times more likely than families in \nlow-poverty neighborhoods to be subject to an ACS investigation.81  \n201.  Black and Hispanic families comprise an overwhelmingly disproportionate number \nof the families that ACS investigates every year in New York City.82  \n \n81   Angela Butel, Data Brief: Child Welfare Investigations & New York City Neighborhoods, THE \nNEW SCH.

In 2022, 81% of families subjected to ACS investigations were Black or Hispanic, \neven though Black and Hispanic families make up just half of New York Cityโs total population.83  \n203.  New York City neighborhoods with high concentrations of Black and Hispanic \nresidents  and  high  child  poverty  rates  face  the  highest  rates  of  ACS  investigations,  while \nneighborhoods with low concentrations of Black and Hispanic residents and low poverty rates face \nthe lowest rates of ACS investigation.84  \n204.  Black and Hispanic families and families who live in neighborhoods with high child \npoverty rates are therefore several times more likely than others to be among the more than 50,000 \nNew York City families investigated by ACS each year. \n205.  As the City acknowledges, โ1 out of every 2 Black children in New York City has \nbeen the subject of an investigation by the time they reach the age of 18[.]โ85  \n206.

ACSโS COERCIVE TACTICS HAVE CAUSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE \nFAMILIES ENORMOUS AND LASTING HARM \n207.  Plaintiffsโ cases exemplify how ACSโs widespread use of the Coercive Tactics to \nenter and search familiesโ homes causes significant and lasting trauma to the tens of thousands of \nfamilies investigated by ACS each year.  \n208.  Beyond  Plaintiffsโ  experiences,  numerous  studies  as  well  as  testimony  from \npsychological experts document the harm to parents and children that invasive ACS home entries \nand searches leave in their wake.  \n209.  A paper in the peer-reviewed journal Archives for Pediatric Adolescent Medicine \ncompared a group of families investigated for child abuse or neglect with a separate group of \nsimilarly situated families not subject to any investigation.87 It concluded that an โinvestigation \npredicted higher maternal depressive symptomsโ but did not bring about any positive effects on \nfamiliesโ social support, general functioning, education, or financial circumstances.88 \n210.  Other psychological and sociological studies have similarly found that parents \nexperience increased depression, โongoing anxiety,โ and โpowerlessnessโ during and after intrusive \ninvestigations into their family lives,89 suffering effects like โsleeplessness, weight loss, nausea, \nnight-terrors, and depression.โ90 These detrimental effects are even more profound for children.91 \n \n87  Kristine A.

Psychological experts have testified that strip-searches of childrenโlike those ACS \nroutinely uses the Coercive Tactics to conductโcan cause children to suffer post-search symptoms \nincluding  โsleep  disturbance,  recurrent  and  intrusive  recollections  of  the  event,  inability  to \nconcentrate, anxiety, depression and development of phobic reactions,โ and in some instances even \nto โattempt suicide.โ92 \n212.  A national research, training, and consultation center that aims to improve child \nwelfare services around the country noted that children experience โsurprise, shock, [and] chaosโ \nduring investigations, as well as a โloss of control,โ โpowerlessness, helplessness,โ a โsense of guilt \nor failure,โ and fear.93  \n213.  Indeed, according to lawyers who represent children in child welfare proceedings \nin New York City, โ[i]t should be noncontroversialโ that child welfare investigations โcould cause \nharm to children[,]โ including โsignificant long-term harm.โ94 Other lawyers representing children \nnote that unnecessary and โinvasiveโ ACS investigations can cause โlasting trauma to children and \nfamilies, particularly in low-income communities of color.โ95 \n \nbetween family membersโ and causes children to โreact with anxiety even to temporary \ninfringements of parental autonomy.โ Id. \n92  Steven F.

ACSโs widespread use of the Coercive Tactics to enter and search familiesโ homes \nand strip-search their children inflicts these harms on New York City families on a massive scale.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n215.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 under Rule 23(b)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of all persons similarly \nsituated. \n216.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a certified Plaintiff class consisting of all adult parents \nor legal guardians subject to ACS investigations in which ACS caseworkers have used, are using, \nor will use the Coercive Tactics to search their homes without a court order or exigent circumstances \n(the โUnconstitutional Home Search Classโ or โClassโ). \n217.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because all four requirements \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) are satisfied. \n218.  Numerosity. The members of the Unconstitutional Home Search Class are too \nnumerous to be joined in one action, and their joinder is impracticable. ACS conducts more than \n50,000 investigations each year, nearly all of which include at least one home search. ACS obtains \na court order or acts upon exigent circumstances in less than 2% of all its investigations. Although \nACS has claimed that it obtains familiesโ consent for home searches during the remaining 98% of \nits investigations, the extensive public record and experiences of the Plaintiffs described in this \nComplaint establish that ACS maintains a widespread policy, custom, and practice of using the \nCoercive Tactics to unconstitutionally search familiesโ homes. Upon information and belief, the \nUnconstitutional Home Search Class consists of tens of thousands of people.  \n219.  Commonality. There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the \nUnconstitutional Home Search Class. These include, without limitation: (1) whether ACS maintains \na widespread policy, custom, and practice of using the Coercive Tactics to enter and search familiesโ \n  44 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 45 of 49 PageID #: 45\n \nhomes during ACS investigations; (2) whether ACSโs use of the Coercive Tactics violates the \nFourth Amendment; (3) whether ACS knows about and is deliberately indifferent to the agencyโs \nwidespread use of the Coercive Tactics; (4) whether ACS has failed to establish adequate policies \nor procedures to protect parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during the tens of thousands of home \nsearches ACS conducts each year; (5) whether ACS fails to adequately train and supervise \ncaseworkers about parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during home searches; (6) whether the Cityโs \nfailure to maintain policies or provide adequate training or supervision regarding parentsโ Fourth \nAmendment rights causes ACSโs widespread use of the Coercive Tactics; and (7) whether ACSโs \nuse of the Coercive Tactics causes harm to class members.  \n220.  Typicality. The violations and injuries suffered by Plaintiffs are typical of those \nsuffered by members of the Unconstitutional Home Search Class. Like all members of the Class, \nPlaintiffs are individuals subject to ACS investigations and against whom ACS caseworkers have \nused, are using, or will use the Coercive Tactics to enter and search their homes without a court \norder or exigent circumstances.  \n221.  Adequacy.  Plaintiffs  and  their  counsel  will  adequately  and  fairly  protect  the \ninterests of all members of the Class. The interests of the Class representatives are consistent with \nthose of the Class members. In addition, counsel for Plaintiffs are experienced in class action and \ncivil rights litigation and have expertise in the conduct of ACS investigations.  \n222.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because the City has acted on grounds that apply generally to the Class, in that \neach member of the Class has suffered, is suffering, or is at risk of suffering violations of the same \nFourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless intrusions into and searches of their home in \nthe absence of exigent circumstances and without voluntary consent. Accordingly, final injunctive \n  45 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 46 of 49 PageID #: 46\n \nrelief  bringing  ACSโs  home  search  policies  and  practices  into  compliance  with  the  Fourth \nAmendment is appropriate respecting the Class as a whole. \n223.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(1)(A) because prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members \nwould create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members \nthat would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ Fourth Amendment โ Unreasonable Search \nUnconstitutional Policy, Custom, and/or Practice \n(All Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against Defendant City \nof New York) \n \n224.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs. \n225.  At all relevant times, Defendant, acting under color of state law and through ACS \nand its officials, employees, agents, servants, and/or representatives, has maintained a policy, \ncustom, and/or practice of using the Coercive Tactics during ACS investigations to enter and search \nfamiliesโ homes without voluntary consent, without a court order, and in the absence of exigent \ncircumstances. \n226.  All acts complained of herein were carried out by ACS officials, employees, agents, \nservants, and/or representatives, pursuant to the policies, customs, and practices of the City, \nincluding ACS.  \n227.  Defendantโs  policy,  custom,  and/or  practice  of using  the  Coercive  Tactics  to \nconduct warrantless, non-exigent home searches during ACS investigations is so widespread and \npersistent that it practically has the force of law and is so manifest that it implies the constructive \nacquiescence of senior policy-making officials.  \n228.  Defendantโs  policy,  custom,  and/or  practice  of using  the  Coercive  Tactics  to \n  46 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 47 of 49 PageID #: 47\n \nconduct warrantless, non-exigent home searches during ACS investigations has directly and/or \nproximately caused deprivations of the rights of Named Plaintiffs, as well as the members of the \nclass they seek to represent, under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution pursuant to \n42 U.S.C ยง 1983. \n229.  As a result of Defendantโs conduct, Plaintiffs suffered the injuries hereinbefore \nalleged. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ Fourth Amendment โ Unreasonable Search \nUnconstitutional Failure to Train or Supervise \n(All Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against Defendant City of \nNew York) \n230.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs.  \n231.  At all relevant times, Defendant, acting under color of state law and through ACS \nand its officials, employees, agents, servants, and/or representatives, has acted with deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ constitutional rights because Defendant (a) knows to \na moral certainty that ACS caseworkers will enter and search familiesโ homes during the tens of \nthousands of investigations the agency conducts each year; (b) knows ACS caseworkers have a \nlong  and  well-documented  practice  of  using  the  Coercive  Tactics  to  conduct  warrantless, \nnon-exigent home searches during ACS investigations; and (c) knows ACS caseworkersโ use of the \nCoercive Tactics deprives parents of their Fourth Amendment rights.  \n232.  Defendant fails to provide adequate training and supervision to ACS caseworkers \nregarding parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during home searches or proper practices to obtain \nvoluntary consent to enter and search familiesโ homes despite knowing that ACS caseworkers will \nconduct home searches during tens of thousands of investigations the agency conducts each year.  \n233.  The need for Defendant to provide more or better supervision regarding compliance \n  47 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 48 of 49 PageID #: 48\n \nwith parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during ACS investigations is obvious, but Defendant has \nmade no meaningful attempt to prevent or forestall ACS caseworkersโ use of the Coercive Tactics. \n234.  Defendantโs failure to adequately train or supervise ACS caseworkers regarding the \nprotection of parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights has directly and/or proximately caused ACS \ncaseworkers to use the Coercive Tactics to conduct warrantless, non-exigent searches of Plaintiffsโ \nand class membersโ homes, depriving Plaintiffs and other class members of their rights under the \nFourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n235.  As a result of Defendantโs conduct, Plaintiffs suffered the injuries hereinbefore \nalleged. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n236.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court: \na.  Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed class pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;  \nb.  Declare that Defendantโs acts, practices, polices, and/or omissions deprive \nPlaintiffs and Class members of their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution;  \nc.  Provide appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to remedy Defendantโs \nunconstitutional policy, custom, and/or practice of using the Coercive Tactics \nto violate parentsโ Fourth Amendment rights during ACS investigations;  \nd.  Award compensatory damages to Named Plaintiffs in amounts that are fair, just, \nand reasonable, to be determined at trial;  \ne.  Award Plaintiffs, including members of the Class, reasonable attorneysโ fees \nand costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \nf.  Grant such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.  \n  48 \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01263-CLP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/24   Page 49 of 49 PageID #: 49\n \nDated: New York, New York \nFebruary 20, 2024 \n \n \nFAMILY JUSTICE LAW CENTER OF THE  EMERY CELLI BRINCKERHOFF ABADY \nURBAN JUSTICE CENTER  WARD & MAAZEL LLP \n   \n/s/ David Shalleck-Klein_________  Katherine Rosenfeld (krosenfeld@ecbawm.com) \nDavid Shalleck-Klein  Max Selver (mselver@ecbawm.com) \n(dshalleckklein@urbanjustice.org)  600 Fifth Avenue, 10th Floor \nEliza J.
