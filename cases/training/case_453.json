During the investigation, the facility was renamed the Metropolitan Developmental Center (MDC).  On January 16, 1986, the DOJ issued a findings letter to the State of Louisiana, alleging constitutional violations in the areas of medical care, record-keeping, staffing, safety procedures, and freedom from of patients undue bodily restraints.  The DOJ proposed a resolution of these violations by consent decree, but on April 22, 1986, Louisiana refused to settle.  </p><p>On January 6, 1987, the DOJ filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA) against the State of Louisiana in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of MDC patients.  On July 22, 1987, the district court (Judge Henry Alvan Mentz, Jr.) issued a consent decree in the case.  The consent decree covered the areas of medical care, staffing, bodily restraints, record-keeping, and safety procedures.  </p><p>Sometime thereafter, in an undated court order, the district court (Judge Mentz) approved a stipulation of dismissal and dismissed the case, finding the defendants in compliance with the consent decree.</p><p></p>",

Sl·'->97\nDear Governor Edwards:\nOn November 30, 1984, we notified you that we were com-\nmencing an investigation of the !'c!lc· C ha <-..<?< r¯.tacc `¯¡C¦ÌÙO1, &\nmental retardation facility, pursuant to tne provisions of\nthe Civil Riçhts of Institutionalized  Persons Act, 42 U.S.C,\nfl997 (1982).  As the statute requires, ¯.-/e arc now writing to\ninform you of the findings of our investigation.\nIn the course of our investigation, ve conducted  a tour\nof Belle Chasse with expert consultants and Civil Rights\nDivision personnel.  In connection with the tour, the consultants\nobserved  residents, examined resident records, and inttrviewe·J\nthe adaini8tratcr, the professional staff, and some of the\ndirect care staff at j;·».ilt Chasse.  liiroup,hout the  investigation,\nBelle Chasse staff and officials of the Louisiana Department\nof Health and hu-uan Resources have provided us with substantial\nassistance*  We Join our consultants in expressing our «ppreciatior\nof the full cooperation offered by school personnel and state\nofficials.\nRased on our investigation, ve believe that the conditions\nat Belle Chasse deprive residents of their constitutional rieh¢s.\nMentally retarded  persons have constitutional rights to adequate\nmedical care, reasonable safety, and such training as would  ensure\npersonal •afety and freedom fron undue bodily restraint.  Your.g,'ur\nv. Romeo,- 457 U.S. 3<·7, 3?4 (1982).  Accordinaly, we will discuss\nonly those particular areas of concern that rise  to the level\nof deprivations of thosf constitutional rights.  Our findings\nand conclusions have bee¤Csu¤narized below.\n-s\n\n- 2 -\nl·  dedication Practices\nThe «edicatior. practices employed at Belle Chasse Staff\nSchool create an unacceptable risk of hare to rtsijcr.t<ä.\nApproximately 31 percent of the residents receive at least one\npsychotroplc drug.  Many medication practices at the facility\nrepresent significant departures from accepted medical\nstandards.\nWhile Belle C^asse physicians are prohibited by Institu-\ntion policy fro¯u writing PR'-,1 (\"as  needed\") orders for\npsychotroplc ape-nts, our consulting p»ychopharr»acoloíîisc\ndiscovered that FRK orders were being used.  Moreover, records\nIndicate that physicians are ordering \"one-ti«e\" doses of\npsychotropic drugs by telephone without directly assessin¾\nor examining residents.  Such practices are i-nperaiss isle\nbecause they permit the administration cf ria?.¡:.trcus drugs\nwithout the judgment of a qualified professional.\nOur consultant noted the practice oi dangerous Intraclass\npolyµharaacy, the administration of multiple drues from tbe\naaae drug class.  The records reviewed  indicated no justitication\nwhatsoever for the practice, which increases dramatically the\nrisk of drug side effects and overmedlcation.  Furthermore\nt\nthe review of drug prescriptions is inadequate,  belle Chasse\npolicies do not require physicians to review their drug\norders at reasonable intervals to ensure appropriate usa?,e\nthrough the exercise of professional judgment.\nThe monitoring of drug usage is totally inadequate.\nTardive Disklr.esia (TD) is an antipsychotic druç induced side\neffect, potentially Irreversible, that may result In permanent\nphysiological damage.  Belle Chasse currently has no policies,\nguidelines, or procedures for TD screening.  Moreover, there\nare no policies governing the diagnosis and care of residents\nwith TD.  Si»rificantly, our consultant observed  several\nresidents who appeared  to suffer from TO.  A review of the\nrecords of these residents Indicated  that none had been\nevaluated or screened  for Tf>.  Our consultant concluded  that\nBelle Chasse personnel do not adequately screen residents for\nTD or treat residents suffering  fro¤ the condition.  Finall·`y,\nresidents do not receive physical examinations or periodic\ntests for drug-induced ailments, including ilfe threatening\nconditions caused by the misuse of psychotropic medication.\nBelle Chasse policy pernits non-nursing personnel to\nadminister medication.  Absent training and necessary profes-\nsional supervision, these individuals lack the competence to\nmake necessary judgments with respect to dangerous drug\ninduced side effects and the need for further medical evalua-\n\n- 3 -\ntion.  Co»pouiïding the deficiency, nnrses art not ir í*i¯! i*t¿ly\navailable on the night shifts in a aajority of facilities to\nrender necessary medical assistance*  Fin«llv, our consultant\nconcluded  that psychotr¯oµic dr.: . ¿rc bcin¾ used as chemical\nrestraints in lieu of behavioral training, which would eliminate\nor reduce the need .for restraints for FO^C residents.  Overuse\nar.d misuse of psychotropic medication, including polyphar~¾'¯ v\nwithout: documented medical Justification, and the absence  a.\ntraining pro¾rarcs exacerbate the improper reliance on drugs\nas a scans of controlling behavior*\n2·  Recordk.ee pins\nInadequate recordkeepine at Belle Chasse contributes to\nnumerous harmful consequences, including drug side effects.\nBelle Chasse has no recordkeepin¾ requirements for physicians;\nprogress notes are written on an \"occurrence basis.\"  Uithour\naccurate- medical records, staff c^-.rot  ;ctemirf t?-ìich therapies\nhave oeen efíective and which have had significant deleterious\neffects.  Our consultant determined  that the integrated\nrecord keeping; syste`a ac Rtlle Cnasse was well i·iar.a¿;ed, yet the\nquality of the physicians* progress notes was poor.  The notes\nwere poorly organized, nearly illegible, and they routinely\noraitted any discussion of the treatment rationales, target\nsy¾>ptoxns, and side effects.  As a result, it is nearly\nimpossible to read a resident's chart and find a coherent\naccount of the drui» treatment process or a discussion of any\nno,••': irmacologicaî  therapy.  Without such docuT`er.t*tior:\n t\nthere is no assurance that dru¾s causinp, significant adverse\neffects will be properly re-evaluated.  Finally, « significant\npart of the training deficiency can be traced to inadequate\nrecord ke e-pine .  Our consultant identified  a distinct absence\nof accurate data with respect to the residents' course of\ntreatment.  Apain, without accurate and sufficient information,\njudgments with respect to necessary training cannot be made\nor a professional basis.  Accordingly, inadequate recordkeepin~\nis causing a significant risk of harm to the Belle Chasse·\nresidents.\n3.  Staffing\nOur consulting psychiatrist deterralned that psychiatric..\nstaffing at üelle Ct»asse is inadequate.  Fellt  Chasse employs\nthe services of a •ingle psychiatrist who spends, on average,\nonly about 6 hours per week at the facility.\" The psychiatrist\nevaluates residents at the request of other Belle Chasse\nphysicians, but does not routinely examine every resident\nreceiving psychotropic drug therapy. ``` Accordingly, the majority\nof direct psychiatric services are handled oy the physicians,\nwho are not knowledgeable about psychiatric diagnoses, indica-\n\n- 4 -\nClo¤· for dru¾ therapies, and dru\" side effects.  Our consul-\ntart concluded  that the underemployment of psychiatric consultants\nha¢ caused t>ost of .the aforeœer.tíored  p8ychophan¤acological\ndeficiencies.\nFinally, our consultact determined that the direct-cart\nstaff at Belle Chasse appears unable to put into practice the\nbasic skills necessary to render minimally adequate care and\nChat degree of training required by YounR,bert>.  For instance, the\nyétaff routinely fails to coxply with basic recordkeepin¾ require-\n¾ents, such as the documentation of behavioral pro<rra·ns and\nrestraints.  The staff should play a vital role in the -'¢-\"'·`pcr.t\nof effective behavioral training, and its inattention to duty\nexposes the clients to significant darters\nREMEDIAL MEASURES\nOn the basis of our investigation, we have concluded\nChat the residents of Belle Chasse State School are subject\nto flagrant or e·rer»,ious conditions that violate their\nconstitutional rights.  We believe that a continuing pattern\nof these conditions has existed at least since 1982.  To\nrectify the deficiencies at fcelle CUasse and to assure that\nconstitutionally adequate conditions arc maintained  thereafter,\nwe propose to ent«r into a legally •>i:¯i.jiní; and judicaliy\nenforceable a.er^ffíf·nt vìth the State of Louisiana.  The\nfollowing are the Minimum measures which, in our view, arc\nneces«ary to remedy the deficiencies discussed abovet\nl·  Belle Chas8e ¤>tø£t ensure that its direct care staff is  `\nsufficiently competent mnd qualified  to provide, as appropriate,\ntraining necessary to afford Youogber¾ protections.\n2.  Belle Chasse »ust Increase the level of staffing\nwith respect to psychiatric services.\n3·  Medication practices «ust be modified, as necessary,\nto ensure that they comport with accepted professional medica£\nstandards.\n4.  Belle Chasse nust ensure, in accordance with professional\njudgment, that residents are provided the training necessary\nto protect Chen from unreasonable risks tc personal safety\nand undue physical or chemical restraints*\n5·  Recordkeeplng aust be improved  and a ¾u£:lity assurance\nsystem must be implemented  in order to ensure that the residents*\nrights ^o personal safety and freedom from undue bodily restraint\nare sufficiently unimpaired.  *\n\nWe arc prepared to provide you with our consultants*\nreports or other technical assistance.  Information •bout\n'federal financial assistance, wnich raay be available to assist\nyou, is available through the Regional Office of the United States\nDepartnent of Health and Hu¶aan Services (Director, Intergovernmental\nand Congressional Affairs, 2i4-767-3338) and through the United\nStates í>epart^icnt of Lducatior`, Office of Special Education.\nOur attorneys will be contacting attorneys for the\nLouisiana Department of Health and Human Resources to discuss\nthis natter ir? greater detail. We seek to resolve this matter\nin the spirit of cooperation intended ay the Civil Ki?·nts of\nInstituticr!alired  Ptrsors Act.

On January 16, 1986, we informed you\nof the findings of our investigation.  We are now writing to\nupdate those findings and to propose an equitable settlement of\nour claims.\nOur original letter of findings discussed particular\nproblems within three general areas of concern:  medication\npractices, recordkeeping , and staffing.  The letter moreover\nlisted the minimum remedial measures that, in our view, were\nnecessary to correct the facility's deficiencies.  In accordance\nwith statutory procedures, on April 22, 1986 our attorneys met\nwith officials of the Louisiana Department of Health and Human\nResources to discuss settling this matter by way of a consent\ndecree.  The state officials refused our offer of settlement,\nbut stated that they would welcome our reevaluation of Belle\nChasse -- renamed the Metropolitan Developmental Center (MDC) --\nunder current circumstances.  We thereafter undertook to reassess\nconditions of confinement at MDC.\nIn essence, the new investigatory tour substantiated\nthe findings of our original investigatory efforts.  Based on\nthe findings of both phases of our investigation, we believe\nthat conditions at MDC deprive residents of their constitutional\nrights.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).  Our\nfindings and conclusions from the most recent investigatory tour\nare summarized below.\n1.  Medication Practices\nMany of the medication practices currently employed at MDC\nrepresent significant departures from accepted medical standards,\nthereby exposing the residents to unacceptable risks of harm.\n\n- 2 -\nIn general, the most harmful medication practices concern the\ninappropriate use of psychotropic drugs.  A large number of MDC\nresidents currently receive at least one psychotropic drug.\nApproximately one-half of all MDC residents have been\ndiagnosed as having both mental retardation and a psychiatric\ndisorder.  The vast majority of such \"dually diagnosed\" residents\nare receiving antipsychotic medication.  Of those residents\nreceiving antipsychotic medication, a full 45% have been given\n•a particular diagnosis not recognized  in the Diagnostic And\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III).\nSome of those residents, as well as numerous others who have\nbeen assigned  imprecise diagnoses, were receiving high doses of\nantipsychotic medication without the proper clinical and diagnostic\njustification.  Indeed, our consultant concluded that MDC employs\nantipsychotic medication primarily as a means of controlling\nbehavior without proper justification.  The overuse or misuse\nof medication in such a manner constitutes a serious departure\nfrom professional standards.\nOur consultant furthermore determined that the overmedication\nof MDC residents was causing harmful consequences.  Numerous\nresidents demonstrated serious neurological side effects from\nsustained exposure to high doses of antipsychotic drugs.\nSeveral other residents were receiving polypharmacy drug regimens\nthat were potentially harmful.  Accordingly, improper medication\npractices at MDC continue to subject the residents to unreasonable\nrisks of harm.\n2.  Drug Monitoring and Screening for Side Effects\nAn MDC draft policy permits the use of some FDA-approved\ndrugs in a manner not indicated on the manufacturer's label.\nNonetheless, our consultant determined  that MDC does not have\nadequate operational guidelines governing  the monitoring of\npatients who are prescribed either a particular cardiovascular\nagent or a particular anticonvulsant agent to control aggression.\nIn the absence of adequate protocols governing the unlabelled\nuse of the drugs, patients may incur dangerous side effects,\nsuch as heart failure.\nThe detection and management of neuroleptic-induced,\ninvoluntary movement disorders at MDC remains dangerously\ninadequate.  Antipsychotic medication may induce a wide range\nof hazardous neurological disorders such as tardive dyskinesia,\nwithdrawal dyskinesia, acute dyskinesia, Parkinsonian symptoms,\nand akathisia.  At the time of our most recent visit, MDC had\nnot officially implemented  formal screening for tardive dyskinesia\nand other abnormal movement disorders.  Our consultant detected\n\n- 3 -\nseveral residents who displayed symptoms of Parkinsonism or\ntardive diskinesia that inhibited their ability to move freely\nand voluntarily.  Overall, our consultant concluded that the\npresent system of monitoring patients on antipsychotic medication\nhas enabled numerous neurological side effects to be overlooked,\nthereby resulting in substandard care for the residents.  In\naddition, an MDC draft policy mandates a 14-day drug-free trial\nfor residents once a year.  For residents receiving high dosages\nof psychotropic agents, a drug-free trial can cause anticholinergic\nwithdrawal reactions and acute behavioral deterioration.\nThe medical monitoring of drug use at MDC is extremely\nsubstandard, and exposes residents receiving drug therapy to\nserious risks of harm.  An MDC policy requires semi-annual\nblood counts and liver function tests for residents receiving\nhigh doses of certain drugs.  Our consultant criticized the MDC\npolicy that requires liver tests for only those patients who\nreceive high doses of drugs, noting that the risk that a patient\nwill acquire a particularly dangerous drug-induced side effect\ndoes not depend on the dosage level.  Moreover, the consultant\nexpressed concern that, with respect to two particular psychotropic\ndrugs, MDC's own maximum daily dosage levels would have to be\nexceeded before the blood and liver tests were performed.  Indeed,\nour consultant discovered that numerous residents were receiving\ndrug therapy despite the absence of the necessary preliminary\nmedical tests.  This has resulted  in the overmedication of some\nresidents, since the drug therapy has been administered without\nthe necessary therapeutic rationale.  Still other patients have\nbeen exposed to an extreme risk of drug-induced toxic poisoning\nby the absence of preliminary and periodic drug-level testing.\nOne patient was not tested  for drug-induced  toxicity until\nalmost two weeks of drug therapy had been administered.  Another\npatient's chart revealed  that his drug therapy had produced a\ntoxicity level that exceeded the point at which the patient\nmay lapse into a coma and was approaching  the level at which\ndeath may result from cardiac arrhythmia, convulsions, and\nnervous-system disorders.  Accordingly, our consultant's overall\nconclusion was that the inadequate medical monitoring of drug\ntherapy was creating an unreasonable risk of harm to MDC residents.\n3.  Staffing\nOur consulting psychiatrist determined  that the level of\npsychiatric staffing at MDC remains inadequate to address the\npsychiatric needs of the MDC residents.  Nearly one-half of all\nMDC residents have been diagnosed as having psychiatric disorders,\nand the psychiatrists simply do not spend enough time at MDC\nexamining these patients.  The majority of psychiatric patients\nhave received diagnoses that either do not comport with contemporary\n\n•  .  -  4  -\ndiagnostic nomenclature or are otherwise meaningless in clinical\npractice.  Furthermore, psychiatric reviews of patients do not\ntake place at reasonable intervals.  Due to the very limited\ninput of the consulting psychiatrists, many psychiatric services\nare performed by staff physicians, who lack the necessary\nqualifications to deliver proper psychiatric care.  As a\nconsequence, the psychiatric services provided MDC residents do\nnot ensure treatment efficacy and safe medical care, thereby\nexposing the residents to unreasonable risks of serious harm.\n4.  Recordkeeping\nRecordkeeping remains inadequate to ensure proper medical\ncare and treatment.  Progress notes, particularly those of the\nattending psychiatrists, are not maintained at acceptable\nintervals.  In general, psychiatric and staff physician progress\nnotes have been inadequate in documenting target symptoms,\ndiagnostic formulations, treatment rationales, and drug side\neffects.  In the absence of such documentation, judgments with\nrespect to medical care, psychiatric treatment, and training\ncannot be made on a professional basis.  Accordingly, inadequate\nrecordkeeping continues to cause a significant risk of harm to\nMDC residents.\n5.  Remedial Measures\nOn the basis of our two separate investigatory tours, we\nhave concluded that the residents of MDC are subject to flagrant\nor egregious conditions that violate their constitutional\nrights.  We believe that a continuing pattern of these conditions\nhas existed at least since 1982.  To rectify the deficiencies\nat MDC and to assure that constitutionally adequate conditions\nare maintained  thereafter, we once again propose to enter into\na legally binding and judically enforceable agreement with the\nState of Louisiana.  The following are the minimum measures\nwhich, in our view, are necessary to remedy the deficiencies\ndiscussed above:\n1.  MDC must increase the level of staffing with respect\nto psychiatric services.\n2.  Medication practices must be modified, as necessary,\nto ensure that they comport with accepted professional medical\nstandards.\n3.  Drug monitoring and screening for side effects must\nbe implemented or modified, as necessary, to ensure that they\ncomport with accepted medical standards.\n4.  MDC must ensure, in accordance with professional\njudgment, that residents are not subjected  to undue bodily\nrestraint.\n\n5.  Recordkeeping must be improved and a quality assurance\nsystem must be implemented  in order to ensure that the residents'\nrights to personal safety and freedom from undue bodily restraint\nare adequately protected.\nAs we indicated  in our previous letter of findings, we\nseek to resolve this matter in the spirit of cooperation intended\nby the Civil Rights of Institutionalized  Persons Act.  In the\nlight of the seriousness of our findings and the extended\nduration of our statutory investigation, we have prepared the\nattached draft of a judically enforceable consent decree.  We\nbelieve that the proposed decree, once implemented, would\nfairly and adequately remedy the constitutional violations that\nour investigation has revealed.  Accordingly, we are offering\nthe decree for the State's approval at this time.\nAs we noted in our previous letter of findings, we are\nprepared to provide you with our consultant's report or other\ntechnical assistance.  Our attorneys will contact attorneys for\nthe Louisiana Department of Health and Human Resources to\ndiscuss these matters in greater detail.\nSincerely,\nWm. Bradford Reynolds\nAssistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division",
