    "summary": "<p>On February 7, 1972 a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of mentally disabled clients of Belchertown State School in Massachusetts against various Commonwealth officials responsible for the operation of the school in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs, filing under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396(a), asserted that conditions at the school violated residents' statutory and constitutional rights, including the right to minimally adequate care and treatment. Similar actions were filed at four other state schools and institutions, including Wrentham, The Dever School, and the Walter E. Fernald State School (later the Fernald Developmental Center). These five cases were later consolidated. After touring the facilities, the Court determined that the level of care at the facilities was indefensible. The parties then drafted consent decrees affecting the five Massachusetts institutions, which were approved in 1978, and are widely considered to have been very effective at improving the conditions of the facilities and the quality of life of the residents. The Clearinghouse has been unable to obtain these consent decrees or the orders approving them. According to background provided in a later judicial opinion in the case, the consent decrees specified mandatory staffing levels to be maintained at the institutions.  </p><p>On June 26, 1981, the Defendants notified the District Court that they intended to decrease the staffing levels at the facilities. The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Public Representation and private counsel, asked the court for a preliminary injunction restraining the Defendants from implementing staff reductions, alleging that the proposed reductions would render the Defendants unable to comply with the consent decrees. The preliminary injunction was granted, and the Defendants agreed to maintain the current staff levels pending the Court's determination of the proposal's merits. In 1982, the Court (Judge Joseph Louis Tauro) denied the Defendant's request to reduce staff levels at the state institutions, as such a reduction would render them unable to comply with the consent decrees. However, the Court set forth an appendix containing positions which could safely be eliminated without violating the decrees. Ricci v. Okin, 537 F.Supp. 817 (D.Mass. 1982). </p><p>On October 9, 1986, the Court (Judge Tauro) determined that it no longer needed to oversee compliance with the consent decrees, and it began the process of disengaging from the litigation. The Court ordered the establishment of an independent Office of Quality Assurance to monitor compliance for a three year period. Ricci v. Callahan, 646 F.Supp. 378 (D.Mass. 1986). </p><p>On January 22, 1992, the Court (Judge Tauro) determined that the Dever School contained several deficiencies in organization and staffing. The Governor had previously stipulated that the school be closed within three years. This decision affected staff layoffs, supervisor resignations and staff morale. The Court ordered that although the Defendants were free to close schools encompassed by the consent decrees, they must maintain appropriate standards and staff levels until the residents could be transferred to other facilities. Ricci v. Okin, 781 F.Supp 826 (D.Mass. 1992). </p><p>The Plaintiffs sought to extend the Office of Quality Assurance for a period exceeding the three year time allotted by the court due to the Defendants' failure to complete several tasks. This motion was granted on June 24, 1992.  Ricci v. Okin, 1992 WL 163215 (D. Mass June 24, 1992).  The Defendants then sought a stay of this motion, which was denied on July 21, 1992. Ricci v. Okin, 1992 WL 175509 (D. Mass July 21, 1992).  The Defendants appealed this order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The Court, in an opinion by then-Judge Stephen Breyer, held that the matter was not appealable. Ricci v. Okin, 978 F.2d 764  (1st Cir. 1992).</p><p>On May 25, 1993, Judge Tauro issued a memorandum order that closed the five consolidated cases, because of his finding that court oversight and monitoring of the facilities was no longer necessary because \"Massachusetts now [had] a system of care and habilitation [for people with mental disabilities] ... probably second to none anywhere in the world,\" and in light of the establishment of a new Governor's Commission on Mental Retardation. He vacated the consent decrees, replacing them with an order containing substantive and procedural provisions for future compliance with Constitutional and statutory standards of care. Ricci v. Okin, 823 F.Supp. 984 (D.Mass. 1993).</p><p>The present docket begins with a 2004 motion to reopen the case and enforce the 1993 order. This motion was filed in response to then-Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney's announcement in 2003 that the Fernald facility and other state-run large centers for people with mental and developmental disabilities would be closed. The petitioners sought to reopen the case and to prevent this closure.</p><p>On August 26, 2004, the Disability Law Center (DLC) filed a motion to intervene in the case, arguing that they had standing under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, U.S.C. §15041 et seq., to litigate on behalf and for the rights of people with disabilities within the state.  They argued that it was necessary that they be granted plaintiff status in order to represent those mentally disabled residents of Massachusetts not presently residing in state institutions but at risk of institutionalization. The motion cited the interest in the case of these individuals because it addressed fundamental issues related to unnecessary institutionalization and the right to community-based services recognized in the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The motion to intervene was granted on August 30, 2004.</p><p>The motion to reopen the case was denied without prejudice on January 20, 2005. A second motion to reopen was filed on February 7, 2006 by the Wrentham Association for Retarded Citizens, arguing that the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\") efforts had fallen short in recent years, and constituted a violation of the 1993 disengagement order. Specifically they alleged that residents were being subjected to substandard care, medical errors and abuse in community-based homes; that personnel were not adequately trained or experienced; that the DMR was failing to conduct periodic reviews required by the 1993 decree; and that the DMR failed to certify \"equal or better\" treatment at new locations for transferred individuals. They alleged that the proposed closing of the facilities would overwhelm the community-based programs that were already inadequate to serve the needs of their recipients.</p><p>On February 8, 2006 the Judge Tauro appointed United States Attorney Michael J. Sullivan to serve as Court Monitor for the consolidated cases, and instructed him to conduct an inquiry and report his findings to the Court. Pending this report, the Court granted a temporary injunction enjoining the DMR from transferring residents from the Fernald Developmental Center. No such injunction was granted for the other facilities in the case, and it is not clear from the court record which of them remained in operation at this point.</p><p>On June 7, 2006 the second motion to reopen the case was also denied without prejudice.  But on August 14, 2007, after receiving the Monitor's Report from the U.S. Attorney, the Court reopened the case and lifted its preliminary injunction barring transfers from Fernald. The Monitor/U.S. Attorney concluded that the DMR had complied with the 1993 order's requirement that transferred residents obtain \"equal or better services.\" Judge Tauro found that Massachusetts' policy of closing Fernald had damaged the State's, and thus the DMR's, ability to adequately assess the needs of the Fernald residents on an individual, as opposed to a wholesale basis. The court reasserted its jurisdiction over the case in order to ensure that the mentally disabled residents were able to fully participate in the decision to transfer them to other facilities or community living arrangements, and issued an order requiring that any communication between the DMR and the residents of Fernald and/or their guardians soliciting choices for residential placement include Fernald among the listed options from which to rank their preference. Ricci v. Okin, 499 F.Supp.2d 89 (D. Mass 2006). The State was not explicitly barred from closing Fernald, but because several residents indicated their preference to remain at the facility it remained open.</p><p>On September 12, 2007, the administration of Governor Deval Patrick appealed Judge Tauro's August 2006 ruling to the First Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. On the same day, a separate appeal was filed jointly by the Association for Retarded Citizens of Massachusetts, and the Disability Law Center, and a third appeal was filed by the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers. The third appeal was withdrawn a few days later.</p><p>On February 26, 2008, an emergency hearing was held before Judge Tauro after the DMR transferred a 91-year-old blind and hearing impaired resident with intellectual disabilities from Fernald, allegedly without following the procedures established in the Judge's August 2006 order. The following day, Judge Tauro issued an memorandum order continuing United States Attorney Sullivan's role as Monitor to investigate the occurrence. The order required the DMR to make all relevant documents available to the Monitor. The Judge also denied Massachusetts' motion to stay further proceedings in the District Court pending the outcome of its appeal, and a motion filed by the Plaintiffs to enjoin all transfers from Fernald pending the outcome of the appeals. Ricci v. Okin, 535 F.Supp.2d 229 (D. Mass 2008).</p><p>On October 1, 2008, the federal First Circuit Court of Appeals (Lynch, J.) issued an order reversing the August 2006 order, and dismissing the Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, finding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to reopen the case and to enter the orders it did.  However, the Appeals Court issued an Amended Judgment on December 5, 2008, clarifying that the 1993 Order remained in full effect.  Ricci v. Patrick, 544 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2008). </p><p>On March 17, 2011, Judge Tauro denied a motion filed by Local 509, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), seeking to reopen the case as intervening plaintiffs, holding that the SEIU lacked the necessary standing to bring their claim. </p><p>On July 26, 2013, a letter was filed with the court on behalf of two Ricci class members. The letter argued that the terms of the Disengagement Order allowed class members to \"bring to this court an independent action in the event that the individual's grievances have not been remedied through existing state procedures.\" The letter appears to challenge the Department of Developmental Services involuntary transfer process, and the state court's acceptance of that process in M.D. v. Department of Developmental Services. </p><p>In that case, the guardian of one of the last fourteen residents at Fernald brought a challenge in Massachusetts state court appealing the Department of Developmental Services decision to transfer that resident from Fernald to a different center. On April 1, 2013, the Appeals Court of Massachusetts affirmed the Superior Court's judgment affirming the transfer. The Appeals Court noted that the decision to close the Fernald Developmental Center was a policy decision no longer subject to review by the Federal courts. M.D. v. Department of Developmental Services, 83 Mass.App.Ct. 463, 985 N.E.2d 863 (2013). </p><p>There is nothing in the docket to indicate any response to this letter, or to another letter that came from family members of a different Fernald resident on August 1, 2013. While there is nothing in the docket formally dismissing the case, it appears it is now closed.</p><p>The Fernald Center's last resident was discharged on Thursday, November 13, 2014. </p>",

    "summary_short": "In 1972 and the years following several class action suits were filed against Massachusetts in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the State violated the Social Security Act and the 14th Amendment Due Process rights of the residents. These cases were consolidated, and in 1978 the facilities all accepted court-approved consent decrees, which gave the Court (Judge Tauro) oversight over their practices and set mandatory goals to improve their services and the quality of life of the residents. In 1993, Judge Tauro held that the consent decrees were no longer necessary, and closed the case with a Final Order mandating that Massachusetts provide all services for the mentally disabled necessary to comply with the US Constitution, the Social Security Act, the ADA, and other applicable law. In 2004 and thereafter, after a plan to close the remaining facilities was announced, several attempts were made to reopen the case. Judge Tauro did reopen the case in 2006, however in 2008 the First District Court of Appeals determined that the District Court had lacked jurisdiction to reopen the case in the given circumstances.",

Fernald\nDevelopmental Center (“Fernald”).  In response, this court appointed U.S. Attorney Michael\nSullivan as Court Monitor to investigate whether the DMR’s past and prospective transfer \nof residents out of Fernald was in compliance with this court’s 1993 Final Order, and applicable\nlaw.  \nWhen the court appointed the Court Monitor on February 8, 2006, it ordered all transfers\nout of Fernald stayed.  More than a year later, on March 6, 2007, the Court Monitor filed his\nreport, a copy of which is attached as an Appendix.  This court entered a March 7, 2007 order\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 2 of 7\nstaying transfers from Fernald, pending consideration of the report and any objections.1  \nThe DMR has recently filed a Motion to Dissolve Court’s Injunction of February 8, 2006,\nBarring Transfers from the Fernald Developmental Center.  For the reasons expressed below, the\ncourt ALLOWS that motion, and vacates its earlier orders of February 8, 2006, and March 7,\n2007.  DMR may transfer class member residents from Fernald, subject to the following.\nIn addition to a complex web of federal and state statutes and regulations that protect the\nresidents of Fernald, those who are Ricci class members have the right to demand that the DMR\n“not approve a transfer of any class member out of a state school into the community, or from one\ncommunity residence to another such residence, until and unless the Superintendent of the\ntransferring school (or the Regional Director of the pertinent community region) certifies that the\nindividual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new\nlocation, and that all ISP-recommended services for the individual’s current needs, as identified in\nthe ISP, are available at the new location.”2 That right, among others, is contained in the court’s\nso-called Final Order, entered on May 25, 1993.\nThe Final Order returned to the DMR the authority to manage and oversee the\nCommonwealth’s facilities.  But, it reserved this court’s right to intervene if “the defendants\nsubstantially fail to provide a state ISP process in compliance with this Order” or “if there is a\n1 That order was appropriate to prevent irreparable harm to the Plaintiff class while the\ncourt considered the matter.  See, e.g., Ricci v. Okin, 978 F.2d 764, 768 (1st Cir. 1992) (Breyer,\nJ.) (“[W]e add that it would not likely benefit the appellants to obtain jurisdiction, for the\npractical, common sense considerations we have mentioned would balance heavily in favor of\npermitting a six-month procedurally-necessitated extension of the October 1986 Order’s life.”). \n2 Ricci v. Okin, 823 F. Supp. 984, 987 (D. Mass. 1993).  “ISP” stands for Individual\nService Plan.  Id. \n2\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 3 of 7\nsystemic failure to provide services to class members as described in this Order.”3 \n After more than a year of exhaustive and meticulous study,4 the Court Monitor concluded\nthat the DMR had complied with the Final Order’s requirement that transferred residents obtain\n“equal or better services.”5  The Court Monitor also concluded that “Fernald residents should be\nallowed to remain at the Fernald facility, since for some, many or most, any other place would not\nmeet an ‘equal or better’ service outcome.”6  This court shares in these conclusions.\nThe DMR objects to the Monitor’s second conclusion arguing that, as a matter of\nfederalism, subject matter jurisdiction, and state and federal law, this court should not and cannot\ndecide for the DMR whether Fernald residents can receive equal or better services elsewhere. \nThis court agrees that, in the first instance, it is the responsibility of the DMR to use the ISP\nprocess to assess the individual needs of each resident.  But, considering the entire record of this\ncase, the Court Monitor’s thorough investigation, as well as more than three decades of personal\noversight of the case and the dozens of “views” by this court of the subject facilities,7 this court\n3 Id. at 988.\n4 The Court Monitor visited DMR intermediate care facilities and community residences\nthroughout the Commonwealth, surveyed day programs, hired independent medical experts,\nscoured the medical and departmental records of the transferred individuals, and met with\nofficials, guardians, and residents.  See generally, The Monitor’s Report, Paper #158 (March 6,\n2007).\n5 Id. at 14.\n6 Id. at 27.\n7 These views of the facilities in question are admissible evidence in this circuit.  \nUnited States v. Gray, 199 F.3d 547, 550 (1st Cir. 1999).\n3\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 4 of 7\nconcludes that the Commonwealth’s stated global policy judgment that Fernald should be closed8\nhas damaged the Commonwealth’s ability to adequately assess the needs of the Fernald residents\non an individual, as opposed to a wholesale basis. \nAlthough the transfers that have taken place so far may have been in the best interests of\nresidents who were able to obtain “equal or better services” elsewhere, the Court Monitor’s\nreport reaches a conclusion that should be apparent to anyone who has visited Fernald.  For some\nFernald residents, a transfer “could have devastating effects that unravel years of positive, non-\nabusive behavior.”9  Of note, the Court Monitor emphasized the importance of simplicity,\ncontinuity, and consistency in the surroundings, activities, and caretakers that help residents live\neach day.10  \nAn essential function of the ISP process is to give residents and guardians a voice in\nimportant decisions.11  It is intended to provide an individual and personalized analysis of each\nresident.  Administering this process under the global declaration that Fernald will be closed,\nhowever, eviscerates this opportunity for fully informed individualized oversight.12  To dismiss the\n8 That the Commonwealth has such a plan is a fact established in the record and\nacknowledged by the DMR.  See The Department of Mental Retardation’s Response To: (1) the\nReport of United States Attorney Michael J. Sullivan; and (2) the Court’s Order Show Cause\nWhy an Injunction Should Not Enter, Paper #198, p. 6 (May 31, 2007) (“On February 23, 2003,\nGovernor Romney announced plans to close the FDC.”).   \n9 The Monitor’s Report, Paper #158, p. 24.\n10 Id.\n11 See e.g., 115 Mass. Code Regs. 6.20(3)(a)(3) (2007). \n12 See Ricci v. Okin, 781 F. Supp. 826, 827, n.4 (D. Mass. 1992) (describing the ISP\nprocess and explaining that “[r]ecommendation[s] as to residential and program placement are\nbased on evaluation of the actual needs of the resident or client rather than on what facilities and\nprograms are currently available”).\n4\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 5 of 7\nbenefit of hearing the voices and wishes of those most directly impacted invites the devastating\neffects about which the Monitor has warned.  The DMR declaration not only disenfranchises the\nparticipants in the ISP process, it also deprives the DMR itself of valuable information, thereby\nundermining the efficacy of the ISP process.  As a consequence, such administration of the ISP\nprocess amounts to a “systemic failure” to provide a compliant ISP process, within the meaning of\nthe Final Order.13\nTo remedy this systemic failure, the court reasserts jurisdiction over this case,14 restores it\nto active status on this court’s docket, and enters the following order:\nAny further communication from Defendant Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nDepartment of Mental Retardation to Fernald residents and their guardians which\nsolicits choices for further residential placement shall include Fernald among the\noptions which residents and guardians may rank when expressing their\npreferences.15\nThis order is consistent with controlling precedent.16  It does not mean that the\n13 The Final Order does not define “systemic.”  As this court oversaw entry of the Final\nOrder, it is uniquely competent to declare that “systemic” simply was intended to have its plain\ndictionary meaning – “of or relating to a system.” Webster’s II New College Dictionary 1120\n(2001).  Accordingly, a systemic failure need not be catastrophic in and of itself.  Rather, it may\nsimply be a problem of any magnitude, which manifests itself on a system-wide basis, across a\nnumber of ISP processes.  \n14 A district court has jurisdiction to enforce an order where the court retained such\njurisdiction when it closed the case.  See Baella-Silva v. Hulsey, 454 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2006). \nThis court did explicitly retain such jurisdiction in the Final Order.  Ricci, 823 F. Supp. at 988.\n15 See Show Cause Order, Paper # 181 (May 9, 2007).  \n16 The DMR asserts that entering such an order would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  There, the Court held that transfer out of\na state institution and to a community setting “is in order when the State’s treatment professionals\nhave determined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a\nless restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be\nreasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs\nof others with mental disabilities.” Id. at 587 (emphasis added).  But this court is not precluding\n5\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 6 of 7\nCommonwealth may never close Fernald.17  It does mean, however, that the DMR must carefully\nassess the needs and wishes of each resident, and provide a genuine and meaningful opportunity\nfor their guardians to participate in their placement decisions.  The court is not dictating what the\nresults of future ISP decision processes must be.  It simply declares that starting an ISP discussion\nwith the assumption that Fernald is not an available alternative for its residents is not acceptable. \nThe court believes that the Commonwealth’s compliance with this order will remedy the\nsystemic failure identified.  Accordingly, the case may again be closed.  All terms of the court’s\nFinal Order, in addition to the order referred to above, remain in effect.  The DMR shall continue\nto have discretion to administer its programs and facilities, subject to the provisions of these\norders.18\nConsistent with the Final Order, this court will not review the results of individual ISP\nprocesses.19  But, should the Plaintiff class believe that a systemic failure once again exists,\nsuch a transfer.  To the contrary, this court is simply ensuring that the DMR use the ISP process\nto adequately assess whether the setting is appropriate and whether it “is not opposed by the\naffected individual.”\n17 As the DMR notes, the Consent Decrees entered by this court prior to the Final Order\ncontemplate facility closure. See Ricci, 781 F. Supp. at 830 (“The Consent Decrees do not\nprohibit the possible closing of any facility. Indeed, if residents are properly placed into alternative\nsettings, and a facility is no longer needed, this court will not interfere with its closure.”).  The\ncourt maintains this position.  The purpose of today’s order is not to interfere with closure, but to\nmake sure alternative placement decisions properly start with the needs and wishes of the\nindividual resident, rather than an inflexible global closure policy.\n18 The court would however, encourage the DMR and the Commonwealth to consider\nalternative proposals for Fernald, such as the one put forward by the Court Monitor at p. 25-26 of\nhis report, which could use the existing capacity and resources available at Fernald to efficiently\nmeet the needs of individuals, as well as the policy priorities of the Commonwealth, without\ncausing the trauma and “devastating effects” that could result from transfers.\n19 Ricci, 823 F. Supp. at 988 (“Individual ISP disputes shall be enforced solely through the\nstate ISP process.”).\n6\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 219   Filed 08/14/07   Page 7 of 7\nPlaintiffs may follow the procedures set forth in paragraph 7(c) of the Final Order to bring the\nmatter to the attention of the DMR, and eventually, back before this court.20\nAN ORDER WILL ISSUE.\n       /s/ Joseph L.

      "text": "781 F.Supp. 826 (1992)\nRobert Simpson RICCI, et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nRobert L. OKIN, M.D., et al., Defendants.\nCiv. A. Nos. 72-0469-T, 74-2768-T, 75-3910-T, 75-5023-T and 75-5210-T.\nUnited States District Court, D. Massachusetts.\nJanuary 22, 1992.\nNonnie S. Burnes, Hill & Barlow, Beryl W. Cohen, Boston, Mass., for plaintiffs.\nDouglas Wilkins, Asst. Atty. Gen., Kim E. Murdock, Gen. Counsel, Dept. of Mental Retardation, Judith Yogman,\nAsst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS' REQUEST FOR\nCLARIFICATION\nTAURO, Chief Judge.\nThis court held hearings on October 28, November 25, and December 9, 1991 to discuss several matters\n827 pertaining to the *827 Paul A. Dever State School (\"Dever\").[1] The October 28 hearing was scheduled because\nof reports from the Office of Quality Assurance (\"OQA\") and the Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") that serious\ndeficiencies existed in the delivery of services to class members residing at Dever.\n[2]\nDuring the October 28 hearing, this court asked the Health Care Finance Administration (\"HCFA\")  to conduct a\nfull survey of Dever in order to determine the extent and pervasiveness of the problems there. HCFA reported at\nthe November 25 hearing that many serious deficiencies existed. Indeed, HCFA informed the court and the\ndefendants that the cited deficiencies must be corrected by February 13, 1992 or Dever would lose its Medicaid\ncertification and its federal funding.\nHCFA's survey determined that the deficiencies at Dever were primarily associated with organization, utilization\nand training of staff. At the hearing, it was made clear that an additional problem at Dever was the adverse\nimpact on staff and residents that followed Governor Weld's June, 1991 announcement that Dever would be\n[3]\nclosed within three years.  Unfortunately, this concept for consolidation was announced even though no specific\nimplementation plans had been formulated. Shortly thereafter, employee absenteeism at Dever rose dramatically.\nStaff morale, already shaken by layoffs initiated in November, 1990, plummeted. In August the school's\nSuperintendent resigned.\nThis court has noted on a number of occasions that the Consent Decrees, and subsequent orders of the court,\nclearly establish procedures for the allocation of staff resources, as well as processes for making community\n[4]\nplacements in accordance with each class members' Individual Service Plan (\"ISP\").\nConsistent with those long established procedures, the court has made it clear that, until a detailed plan is in\nplace for the relocation of Dever residents and the real-location of related resources, the defendants should not\nconsider the closure of Dever a certainty. The court has also made clear that, during any phase out of Dever, all\nservices and staffing levels must be maintained in accordance with Consent Decree standards and this court's\norders. These points were reiterated at the December 9, 1991 hearing during which time the court discussed\n[5]\nlanguage in a personnel advertisement that assumed the closure of Dever in three years.\nThe purpose of this memorandum is to once again clarify the defendants' obligations to class members in\nproceeding with development of plans for implementing the Governor's various proposals to consolidate facilities\n\n828 for the mentally retarded. The court is not opposed to the *828 eventual closing of Dever or any other Consent\nDecree facility. But, the court will not allow services to deteriorate at a facility while the state defendants go\nthrough the process of deciding what is going to happen to the residents. Rather, it is this court's expectation that\na plan, founded upon the defendants' obligations, will be provided to assure that all class members will be\nprotected throughout the process. Those obligations, specified in the Consent Decrees, the Personnel Decree,\nthe Capital/Community Plan, Title XIX, and the court's memorandum and order of October 9, 1986\n[6]\n(Disengagement Order),  require the maintenance of adequate personnel levels at the state schools, the\nongoing provision of services in accordance with class members' ISPs, and the utilization of evaluation and\nmonitoring mechanisms.\nI.\nThe Personnel Decree, agreed to by the parties on July 10, 1978, provides that the defendants have a\n\"continuing commitment under the terms of this Decree ... to comply with the personnel standards for care and\ntreatment set forth in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, and regulations promulgated\nthereunder.\" Personnel Decree ¶ 2. Specifically, ¶ 10 of the Personnel Decree recognized that, with decreasing\nresident population at the schools, staffing levels should be correspondingly adjusted. Before such changes could\ntake place, however, the defendants agreed to obtain agreement of plaintiffs' counsel or, failing that, to bring any\ndisagreement to the attention of the court for its resolution. Id. ¶ 10.\nIn 1986, to eliminate the need for continuing court intervention, this court adopted certain procedures, developed\nby the defendants under the supervision of HCFA. These procedures allow for adjustments in personnel levels at\nthe schools to implement the defendants' planned reassignment of staff to housing agenda programs. The\ndefendants created the \"Single Standard Methodology\" and various quality assurance and reporting procedures\nto ensure that services would be in place for class members upon their move to the community, and that services\nwould be maintained at the state schools for those still residing there.\nIn the Disengagement Order, the court extended the use of the Single Standard Methodology to any situation in\nthe future that would call for adjustment of staffing at the state schools resulting from community placement or\nincreased resident need. The court expects the defendants to continue utilizing these procedures should they\nseek to reduce staffing levels at any of the schools.\nII.\nIn addition to maintaining staffing levels at the state schools, the defendants are obligated to substantially provide\nan array of services to each class member in accordance with his or her ISP. The Consent Decrees were\nfashioned by the parties to ensure the provision of those services wherever class members reside. For example,\nthe Dever and Wrentham Decrees provide that \"[t]he defendants will substantially provide or cause to be\nprovided the services recommended in the individual service plan of each member for so long as such services\nare needed.\" Dever and Wrentham Decrees ¶ 14. In order to close Dever, or any other Consent Decree facility,\nthe defendants must assure this court that they will meet each class member's needs, as specified in his or her\nISP.\nThe Decrees permit significant changes in the life circumstances of class members, including the anticipated\nmovement of a majority of class members from institutional environments to community homes. The Capital/\nCommunity Plan (\"CCP\"), an attachment to the Dever and Wrentham Decrees, specifically sets forth how the\ndefendants are to comply with the requirements of the Dever and Wrentham Decrees for class members residing\n829 outside the Dever *829 and Wrentham State Schools. See CCP ¶ 1. The CCP includes commitments made by\nthe defendants regarding the development and maintenance of a system of services as well as a set of\nprocedures for planning and for monitoring those services. In recognition of the evolutionary nature of these\nevents, the Decrees, the CCP and the subsequent rulings of this court have been fashioned in a flexible manner\nthat guides the process as it unfolds, and provides safeguards for class members. Indeed, the CCP recognizes\n\nthe need for the continual refinement of plans to accommodate unpredictable circumstances affecting the class,\nand makes explicit types of plans necessary when designing community services. Id. ¶¶ 16, 17.\nThe Governor's Consolidation Plan calls for the residential movement of hundreds of class members. It calls for\nthe placement of over 800 residents from retardation facilities into a variety of community programs throughout\nthe Commonwealth (most of these programs are not yet developed), and the subsequent closing and\nconsolidation of certain state school facilities. It is, however, an over-simplification to assume that these will be\nthe only residents affected. In order to effectuate consolidation, numerous residential transfers within each facility,\n[7]\nas well as the transfer of several class members from one institution to another, may also be required.  Finally,\nthe process is likely to result in the reassignment and reallocation of staff currently working at the facilities.\nIII.\nIn the past, it has been this court's practice to ask the parties during time of great change to work together to\nensure class members' best interests are well served. The court has requested that the defendants reaffirm and\nfocus their obligations through adoption of a plan that informs the plaintiffs and court of the manner anticipated\n[8]\nchanges will be managed and to provide assurances that defendants' obligations will be actively addressed.\nGiven the far reaching nature of the Governor's Plan, and the number of class members who would be affected\nby its implementation, it is not unreasonable to call upon the defendants to provide the plaintiffs and the court\nwith such a plan. The defendants plan should, at a minimum, be able to demonstrate their ability to maintain the\nfollowing ongoing obligations to class members:\nDecisions regarding proposed services and residential placements must be made in accordance\n[9]\nwith the ISP process;\nService levels at the facilities must be maintained in accordance with Title XIX and Consent\n[10]\nDecree standards;\nPlacements must occur into programs that substantially meet class members' ISPs and are\nconsistent with the various standards established under the Consent Decrees, Title XIX, and the\n[11]\nCapital/Community Plan;\n830 *830 Appropriate mechanisms must exist to provide class members and their families with due\nprocess rights regarding all ISP decisions, including transfer decisions into the community and to\n[12]\nother institutions;\nAdequate advance notice of proposed transfers will continue to be provided to the plaintiffs and to\n[13]\nthe Office of Quality Assurance;  and\nNecessary quality assurance/monitoring mechanism and reporting procedures will be in place to\nensure the integrity of the planning process, the adequacy of placements, and the maintenance of\n[14]\nservices to class members remaining at the state schools.\nIV.\nThe Consent Decrees do not prohibit the possible closing of any facility. Indeed, if residents are properly placed\ninto alternative settings, and a facility is no longer needed, this court will not interfere with its closure.\nBut, this court does insist that services be properly maintained at all facilities throughout the transfer process, and\nthat the alternative placements are made into appropriate settings. The critical HCFA report should be adequate\nnotice to the defendants that, in their commendable effort to consolidate and save money, the quality of life at\nDever has suffered.\n\n[1] For a history of the litigation associated with this case, see Ricci v. Okin, 537 F.Supp. 817, 819-822 (1982).\n[2] HCFA, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for certifying institutions\nunder the Title XIX Medicaid program.\n[3] The Governor's declaration was made as part of a larger plan to consolidate several institutions operated by\nthe Department of Mental Retardation, Department of Mental Health, and DPH. See Actions for Quality Care: A\nPlan for the Consolidation of State Institutions & for the Provision of Appropriate Care Services (June 1991)\n(\"Consolidation Plan\").\n[4] Each resident has his or her own service plan. These plans are developed under the supervision of a qualified\nmental retardation professional. They address the individual's residential and programmatic needs, vocational\nwork needs and capabilities, medical needs, physical needs, equipment needs, guardianship needs and\nhabilitation needs as a whole including all education, recreation, speech therapy, physical therapy, support\nservices and other services required by the Decrees to meet the needs of the individual. They describe short and\nlong term program goals and timetables for the attainment of those goals, and evaluate the individual's need for\ninstitutional care. Recommendation as to residential and program placement are based on evaluation of the\nactual needs of the resident or client rather than on what facilities and programs are currently available. See\nDever Decree ¶ 6.\n[5] The defendants advertised for a position of Assistant Superintendent for Administration at the Dever State\nSchool, seeking an individual to assist with the \"planned phase-down of the Dever State School\" which was\n\"expected to be completed over a three year period....\" Boston Globe, Dec. 1, 1991.\n[6] The court issued the Disengagement Order to permit it to cease the active supervision of defendants'\ncompliance with the Consent Decrees. The court ordered the Governor's Office to create the Office of Quality\nAssurance to oversee the provision of services to the class members.\n[7] The court is aware that, at the time the parties entered into the Dever and Wrentham Decrees, they disagreed\nover \"whether DMH can transfer residents to other state mental retardation institutions where that facility offers\nequivalent services and an equivalent environment....\" Dever and Wrentham Decrees ¶ 46. The parties did\nagree, however, that before the defendants could recommend interinstitutional transfers, the defendants would\ncomply with the placement procedures outlined in the Decrees, which gives the residents or their guardians an\nopportunity to object to the placement. Id. ¶¶ 42-44. In the event defendants propose the transfer of certain class\nmembers from one state school to another, such decisions will be made with reference to the same standards,\nregulations, and procedures governing community transfers.\n[8] Nothing in this order shall be construed as a restriction on defendants' ability to continue to make community\nplacements of individual class members as part of their continuing efforts to implement ISP recommendations.\n[9]See Dever and Wrentham Decrees ¶¶ 6-8; Fernald Decree ¶¶ 10-14.\n[10] Title XIX requires the creation of Individual Service Plans, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(31)(A), as well as active\ntreatment in accordance with those plans, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(2). See also Disengagement Order ¶ 1 (requiring\ncompliance with Title XIX requirements).\n[11]See Dever and Wrentham Decrees ¶ 34; CCP ¶¶ 9, 16-21. See also CCP ¶ 2 (prohibits reducing the current\nlevel of services to non-class members as a means of funding services to class members); CCP ¶ 13 (specifically\nidentifies the role and responsibility of the service coordinator). The CCP in its entirety provides standards for the\nappropriate placement of class members into community settings.\n[12]See CCP ¶¶ 6, 12, 41-46; Mass.Regs.Code tit. 104, §§ 20.03-20.14 (Standards to Promote Client Dignity),\n§§ 21.60-21.63 (Modification of ISP Special Transfer Requirements), §§ 21.85-21.90 (Client Appeals).

In accordance with the Final Order, \nPlaintiffs and Defendants have met personally on May 28, June 7, and June 8,2004 \nto discuss and seek to resolve any remaining dispute under the notice. \nHaving complied with the procedures required by the Court in the Final Order \nof May 25, 1993, the following disputes as set forth in the notice by Plaintiffs have not \nbeen resolved: \nThe Defendants have not complied with the following requirements of the \nOrder: \n\"Defendants shall not approve a transfer of any class member of a state school into \nthe community, or from one community residence to another such residence, until \nand unless the Superintendent of the transferring school (or the Regional Director of \nthe pertinent community region) certifies that the individual to be transferred will \nreceive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location and that all \nISP-recommended services for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP \nare available at the new location.\" (Reference Order paragraph 4) \nThis directive mandated by the Final Order of the Court on May 25, 1993 was \nintended to ensure and safeguard the continued existence, quality and parity of the \nservices provided to Ricci class members, regardless of their changing residential \nsettings. \n2 \n\nIt is this requirement that singularly keeps hope alive for thousands of Ricci \nclass members and their families who are uniquely affected by the Final Order of the \nCourt, which guarantees them a lifetime of quality of service to meet their individual \nneeds. \nDespite the fact that hundreds of former residents at Belchertown, Dever, \nMonson, Fernald, and Wrentham as class members have been transferred out of \nthese facilities since the Final Order of the Court on May 25, 1993, the Defendants \nhave disregarded and totally failed to comply with the Court Order requiring them to \ncertify that the individuals who were transferred would receive \"equal or better \nservices to meet their needs in the new location and that all ISP-recommended \nservices for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP are available at the \nnew location.\" (See sample copies of Ricci Class Member Change of Home Address \nForm attached hereto as Exhibit 5.) \nThe Defendants have not substantially complied with the following \nrequirements of the Order: \n\"Defendants shall substantially provide services to each class member on a lifetime \nbasis. The specific services to be provided to each class member to meet this \nobligation, and defining this obligation, shall be set forth in an Individual Service Plan \n(\"ISP\") that details each class member's capabilities and needs for services, pursuant \nto the regulations governing the preparation of ISP's. as currently set forth in 103 \nCMR 20, et seq.  (the \"ISP Regulations,,).2 Such services shall include, as appropriate \nfor the person, residential programs; day programs; recreational and leisure time \nactivities; medical psychological, dental and health-related professional services; \nrespite care and crisis intervention services; support and generic services, such as \nThese regulations shall guarantee that each class member be provided with the least restrictive, most normal, \n2 \nappropriate residential environment, together with the most appropriate treatment, training, and support services \nsuited to the person's individual needs. \n3 \n\nguardianship and adaptive equipment services; and transportation services.\" \n(Reference Order paragraph 2a) \n\"Defendants shall not seek to amend, revise, or otherwise modify the ISP Regulations \nas they affect class members except upon 60 days written notice to the plaintiffs' \ncounsel, with an opportunity for plaintiffs to comment upon the proposed changes. \nAny amendments must leave in place a process that is at least the substantial \nequivalent of the regulations currently set forth in 104 CMR 20 et seq., with regard to \nthe definition of the ISP, the individualized nature of the ISP, the existence of an \nappeal process, and the principles contained in footnotes 2 and 3 herein.\" (Reference \nOrder paragraph 2b) \n\"Defendants shall continue to seek to improve, and shall not undermine, the progress \nachieved during the period of this litigation by: \na.  Maintaining and implementing the basic principles of the ISP.3\n\" \n(Reference Order paragraph 6a) \n115 CMR 6.20 through 6.63 sets forth the standards and procedures for the \ndevelopment, modification, and review of Individual Support Plans, which are \nrequired to be reviewed and updated on an annual basis with the fullest possible \nparticipation by the individual, the members of the individual's family, the guardians, if \nany, service coordinators, representatives or providers of supports to the individual, \nand the individual's designated representatives and others who provide friendship \nand support to the individual. (See Department of Mental Retardation ISP \nRegulations 115 CMR 6.20 - 6.63 attached hereto as Exhibit 6.) \nNotwithstanding the mandated strict requirements of both the ISP Regulations \nand the Final Order of the Court, the Defendants have, in the absence of specific \n3 These principles, currently in Department of Mental Retardation regulations, are \"(I) human dignity, (2) \nhumane and adequate care and treatment, (3) self-determination and freedom of choice to the person's fullest \ncapacity, (4) the opportunity to live and receive services in the least restrictive and most normal setting possible, \n(5) the opportunity to undergo normal developmental experiences, even though such experiences may entail an \nelement of risk, provided however that the person's safety and well-being shall not be unreasonably jeopardized, \nand (6) the opportunity to engage in activities and styles ofliving which encourage and maintain the integration \nof the client in the community through individualized social and physical environment.\" \n4 \n\nregulatory authority, created a Placement Planning Process for the displacement of \nall current residents at the Developmental Centers at Fernald, Glavin, Hogan, \nMonson, Templeton, and Wrentham, which process includes a Placement Profile, in \nwhich the entire ISP \"team\" authorized by Regulation (115 CMR 6.21 et seq.) does \nnot fully participate, but instead the program, support needs, and alternative future \nresidential site of the individual are determined by an Individual Transition Planning \nTeam comprised of Fernald administrators only. \nThe placement process now being used by the Defendants, which is not \nauthorized by statute or regulation, allows the Defendants to avoid family/guardian \nchoice to remain at Fernald where residents in many instances have lived for their \nentire lives in familiar settings and with familiar staff that can provide active treatment \nas determined by ISP team members. \nThe entire Placement Profile form is not filled out with families and guardians \nat a pre-Individual Support Plan meeting authorized in accordance with 115 CMR \n6.21 (5) and, therefore, denies families and guardians to exercise critical input in the \nProfile. There is no indication in the Profile regarding the planned future of closings of \nMonson, Wrentham, Hogan, Templeton or Glavin, making it impossible for families \nand guardians to make informed choices which could result in a future series of \nharmful relocations. The Placement Profile contains no information as to the Home \nand Community Based Waiver Program so as to inform families of the significant \nconsequences of accepting a transfer into the community and waiving their right to \n5 \n\ntraditional services at an intermediate care facility. The Placement Profile provides \nonly a minimum opportunity to describe residents' needs for a workshop or day \nprogram. The Profile does not require a guardian's approval or signature. The \nPlacement Profile form does not clearly assess the resident's readiness for \ndischarge. It does not raise issues likely to occur for severely and profoundly retarded \nindividuals with multiple physical and behavioral difficulties as a result of relocation, \nnor does it outline how such issues might need to be addressed before, during or \nafter relocation. (See Placement Profiles attached hereto as Exhibit 7.) \nSince Governor Romney unilaterally made, within 30 days of his assuming \noffice, the decision to close Fernald and all other Developmental Centers during his \nadministration, the Defendants have never suggested that the individual resident's \nprogram and treatment needs wiU be better served by a transfer to another facility, \nwhich itself will then be closed. \nClearly, the Placement Profile process established by the Defendants \neffectively undermines, circumvents and denies to family members and guardians the \ntimely opportunity to invoke an Appeal Process, an Informal Conference, a Fair \nHearing, and Judicial Review as guaranteed by the ISP Regulations (115 CMR 6.32 \net seq.).  (See Exhibit 6 supra.) \nFurther, the development of the Placement Profile by the Defendants over the \nstrong objection of family members and guardians contravenes the established \n6 \n\npurpose of the ISP, the individualized nature of the ISP, the participation by family \nmembers in ISP planninga, the existence of an appeal process, and the principles \ncontained in footnotes 2 and 3 infra of the Order. \nSince the announcement on February 26, 2003 by Governor Romney of his \nintention to close Fernald and all other ICF-MRs at Glavin, Hogan, Monson, \nTempleton, and Wrentham during his administration, the Defendants, without specific \nregulatory authority and in the absence of a reconvened ISP team, have conducted \nreviews of ISPs previously completed by family, guardians, and team members and \nhave edited and otherwise re-written ISPs, in the absence of family members, \nguardians, and team member professionals, with the purpose of intentionally \nreducing costs, services and supports to residents, which clearly constitutes a \nsystemic violation of the specific mandates of the Order. \nAmong the programs and services which have been administratively deleted \nfrom the previously team-approved ISPs by the Fernald administration are speech \ntherapy, psychological services, therapeutic swimming pool, medication, habilitation \nprograms, cane training for totally blind resident, music therapy, specific nursing \na (4) The individual's family is encouraged to participate in all aspects of the ISP process, provided that the \nindividual does not knowingly object and that the individual's guardian, ifany, does not object. \nThe responsibilities of the family and guardian in the ISP process are: \n(a) To participate in the ISP process as fully as possible; \n(b) To work collaboratively with the individual and other team members to identify the individual's goals, \nand to develop and ISP which is likely to be effective in assisting the individual to achieve those goals; \n(c) To approve or appeal the ISP if authorized to do so pursuant to 115 CMR 6.32; and \n(d) To provide ongoing feedback to the service coordinator and providers regarding their satisfaction with \nthe ISP and the implementation thereof, and regarding the need for modification of the ISP. \n(Reference 115 CMR 6.21(4)) \n7 \n\nhours, attendance at church services, and need for 24-hour awake staff. (See \nAffidavits of Edwin Harrow, Diane Booher, Marie Drugan, Maureen Kacinski, \nJudi M. Leonard, Carmella Harris, M. Jean Sullivan, Albert Pizella, Thomas Sobutka, \nand Lucia Conti attached hereto as Exhibit 8.) \nThe Defendants have restricted and otherwise limited the information \ndescribing service needs including clinical information and social work assessments \nthat are included in Individual Support Plans. The obvious consequence of this \nadministrative editing and re-working the team-approved ISP constitutes a reduction \nin the Court-Ordered standard of equal or better services at the time of a modification \nor transfer to another facility. \nStaff at Fernald have been directed by the administration that any supports \nmandated by DMR policy should not be included in the ISP, for reason that if \neveryone receives particular supports, they are no longer to be considered specific to \nthe individual. Further, the administration has invoked a definition of the term Current \nSupport that is contradictory to the ISP regulations and has decreed that if a resident \nhas not recently accessed a particular support, it shall not be included in the current \nISP. Since DMR policies vary with respect to where the client lives, and clients living \nin intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded such as Fernald have more \ndepartmentally mandated clinical services than clients living in community \nresidences, excluding clinical services unique to ICF-MRs from individual ISPs \neliminates those clinical services from the standard of what is considered equal or \n8 \n\nbetter service at the time of a modification or transfer to another facility. The net \nresult of these policies imposed by the Defendants is that demonstrated needs of \nresidents, many of whom are medically fragile, are not being accurately documented. \nAlthough the other Developmental Centers, Glavin, Hogan, Monson, \nTempleton, and Wrentham, beginning in 1997, adopted, consistent with Department \nwide practice, a \"new\" ISP form, with particular instructions for their implementation, \nthe Fernald administration continued to use the \"old\" ISP form until 2003 so that \ncritical information regarding the residents was omitted for a six-year period. \nAlthough Fernald staff was specifically trained in the use of the new ISP format, the \nDefendants denied a request from the Plaintiffs that a similar training opportunity be \ngranted to parents and legal guardians participating in the new format in order to \neffectively and independently represent the interests of their resident family member. \nNotwithstanding the announced intention by Governor Romney in February \n2003 to close Fernald and all existing ICF-MRs at Glavin, Hogan, Monson, \nTempleton, Wrentham, and to transfer, beginning in 2004, all current residents at \nFernald to other facilities, not one modification or transfer ISP required by Regulation \n(115 CMR 6.25 and 6.63) has been scheduled or held, which effectively denies \nfamilies and guardians the opportunity to timely participate in an administrative and \njudicial appeal of the relocation of the affected resident. \n9 \n\nThe Defendants have not substantially complied with the following \nrequirements of the Order: \n\"Defendants shall continue to seek to improve, and shall not undermine, the progress \nachieved during the period of this litigation by: \nb. Exerting their best efforts to maintain and secure sufficient funds to meet the needs \nof class members under this Order.\" (Reference Order paragraph 6b) \nAlthough Governor Romney originally publicly announced his estimate that the \nclosing of Fernald would result in annual savings of $4.5 million, testimony before the \nLegislative Committees on Ways and Means has confirmed that there will be no \nsavings with the planned closing of Fernald or of any other ICFMR. \nThe impact of the FY2005 budget, which reduces the DMR facility account by \n$5 million, together with recent prior budget reductions, will create a situation which \nplaces class members at risk and severely affects the Defendants' ability to meet its \nCourt-mandated obligations to provide active treatment for Ricci class members. \nThe budget recommendations of Governor Romney for FY2005 are \ndisingenuous in that they do not include any increase in funds to accommodate \nadditional facilities, staff, or programs for the 267 Fernald residents intended to be \ntransferred to other DMR-operated facilities.  (See Affidavit of William Gauthier \nattached hereto as Exhibit 9.) \nThe magnitude and impact of currently proposed budget reductions can only \nbe considered in the context of 543 personnel reductions made at ICF-MRs in recent \n10 \n\nprior years, which together with the proposed budget for FY2005 clearly establish a \nsystemic violation of the Order. It is both irrelevant and misleading to compare the \nFY1993 level of Legislative appropriation to DMR with the necessary appropriation to \nthat agency to meet the current needs of class members under the Order. \nDue to the reductions in the DMR budget for FY2002, there was a loss of \napproximately 162 staff positions (47 at Fernald; 23 at Monson; 23 at Wrentham; 31 \nat Hogan; 13 at Templeton), including Psychologists, Registered Nurses I, II, III, IV \nand V, Ward Aides, Habilitative Coordinators, Speech Language Pathologists, \nAudiologists, Occupational Therapist Assistants and Aides, Mental Retardation \nWorkers III and IV, Physical Therapy Assistants, and other required personnel, which \nhave, notwithstanding federal or state surveys, already created a situation which \ncompromises the Defendants' ability to. comply with the Order and places class \nmembers at risk.  (See List of FY2002 Staff Reductions attached hereto as \nExhibit 10.) \nIn addition to the staff losses caused by budget reductions in FY2002 above \ndescribed, the Department facilities lost an additional 225 staff members (28 at \nFernald; 24 at Monson; 48 at Wrentham; 21 at Hogan; 13 at Templeton), who were \noffered and accepted early retirement from positions they previously held, including \nbut not limited to, MRW III and IV, Launderer, Power Plant Engineer, Groundskeeper, \nRN IV and V, Machinist, Painter, Carpenters, Cook, Human Services Coordinators, \nPsychologists, Canteen Workers, Motor Truck Driver, and Tradesworker, all of whom \n11 \n\nhad provided significant services to the residents.  (See List of Job Titles and \nLocation attached hereto as Exhibit 11.) \nThe unprecedented loss of staff, including professionals, supervisory, direct \ncare, and support staff since the entry of the Final Order on May 25, 1993 was further \nexacerbated in November 2003 by the additional loss of 156 staff members, who \nwere offered and accepted early retirement from positions they previously held, all of \nwhom had provided significant services to the residents at the Developmental \nCenters at Glavin, Hogan, Monson, Templeton, Wrentham and Fernald (See List of \nJob Titles and Location attached hereto as Exhibit 12.) \nThe implementation of the FY2005 budget reductions in the Facilities Account, \ntogether with the increasing number of unfilled vacant staff positions, will necessarily \nresult in an additional loss of personnel to an unacceptable degree and add to the \nalready heavy caseloads of those clinicians, direct care workers, and support staff, \nwho provide necessary services to class members.  (See Affidavits of Peter Brand \nand Kay Schodek attached hereto as Exhibit 13.) \nThe $5 million reduction for FY2005 in the DMR Facilities Account proposed \nby the Governor and approved by the Legislature will necessarily require additional \nsignificant reductions in professional, clinical and support staff, which will make it \nimpossible for the Defendants to meet the ISP-documented needs of class members \nin accordance with the provisions of the Court's Order of May 25, 1993. \n12 \n\nThe Defendants have not substantially complied with the following \nrequirements of the Order: \n\"Sufficient adequately trained and experienced personnel, as reasonably determined \nby the Department of Mental Retardation based on professional judgment, shall be \navailable to substantially meet the needs set forth in each class member's ISP.\" \n(Reference Order paragraph 2c) \nOf the nearly 1,200 individuals currently resident at the Developmental \nCenters at Fernald, Glavin, Hogan, Monson, Templeton, and Wrentham, nearly 75% \nof those individuals have been diagnosed with either profound or severe mental \nretardation. At Fernald alone, approximately 90% of the residents are identified as \nprofoundly or severely retarded. At all the current Developmental Centers, nearly \n40% of the residents are non-ambulatory, who require ground floor living and work \nspace. At Fernald alone, nearly 65% of the residents are not independently \nambulatory. In addition, approximately 10% of the total population of Fernald is tube \nfed and an additional 79% are required to follow a texturized diet. \nIndicative of the effect that professional staff reduction has had upon the \nresident population at Fernald is the fact that the psychology staff to resident ratio is \nnow 1: 54; social worker staff 1: 64; habilitation coordinator staff 1: 30; recreation \ntherapy staff 1 :24. Further, there are now only three occupational therapists, 2.5 \nphysical therapists, 2 physical therapy assistants, 2.75 physicians, 12 nurse \npractitioners, and 1.25 speech therapists to serve all of the current residents at \nFernald. \n13 \n\nAt Fernald, during the past six months, there have remained unfilled over 20 \nMRW vacancies, 14 LPN vacancies, and 12 RN vacancies, requiring inappropriate \nshort-term use of floating personnel, unnecessary overtime, increased caseloads for \nremaining staff, and an attendant lack of supervision. Only minimal efforts have been \nexerted to recruit and replace vacant positions. In many instances, vacant staff \npositions have not even been posted. \nAt all the DMR facilities, there has been a significant reduction in both clinical \nand support staff during the past several years due to lay-offs, retirements, and the \nfailure to fill vacant positions. At Fernald Development Center, in particular, in the \npast two years, there has been a reduction of MRW4 staff positions from 42 to 22; \nMRW3 staff positions from 36 to 20; psychologists from 13 to 7; motor truck driver \nfrom 7 to 4; tradesworker from 4 to 2; groundskeepers from 6 to 3; electrician from 6 \nto 3; plumber from 3 to 1; recreational therapist from 4 to 2; fabric worker from 2 to 0; \nroofer from 1 to 0; mason 1 to O. \nAlthough the client census at Fernald during the past two years has been \nreduced by approximately 10%, there has been a staff reduction during the same \nperiod of approximately 50%, which has directly affected resident participation in \nactive treatment programs and recreational activities, reduced access to the activity \ncenter, closure of the cafe two years ago, together with a reduced availability of \ntherapeutic programs conducted at the swimming pool. \n14 \n\nIn furtherance of the announced policy to close all of the Developmental \nCenters in the next several years, the Defendants have failed to provide \nappropriations to meet the large scale present need for capital improvements and \nrepairs.  As reported as recently as May 2002 by the Department's Facility Planning \nWorking Group, the Defendants have since 1998 conducted self-surveys of capital \nneeds assessments including projections, adjusted to include feasibility study costs, \ndesign fees, and construction costs, for each of the ICF-MRs. In addition, the Division \nof Capital Asset Management in contract with the firm of Parsons-Binkerhoff \nconducted a recent survey of repair and equipment replacement in a building by \nbuilding survey at Fernald, which survey has never been publicly disseminated. \nNeither the self-survey by Fernald staff nor the review by Parsons-Binkerhoff \nof capital needs at Fernald or other facilities at Glavin, Hogan, Monson, Templeton, \nand Wrentham have been significantly funded, which has resulted in a continuous \nstate of disrepair at these facilities. \nThe policy decision announced by Governor Romney to close or consolidate \nexisting DMR facilities which are subject to the Final Order together with the \nunprecedented reduction in personnel and available budget in the past several years \ntotally undermines and erodes the progress achieved by the Federal Court during the \nperiod of litigation 1972 - 1993 and accordingly, represents a systemic violation. \n15 \n\nFurther, since it has been announced that all of the existing Developmental \nCenters will be closed during Governor Romney's term in office, there is no approved \nplan to accommodate the social and psychological impact of necessary multiple \nmoves and disruption, which will occur in the lives of the residents and their families. \nA careful reading of the facts alleged in the original Class Action Complaints \nfiled in 1972 and 1974 now presents, to an alarming degree, a repetition, 30 years \nlater, of the same conditions, including but not limited to, insufficient staffing, lack of \nequipment, delayed maintenance, repeated problems with infestation of vermin, \ntransportation issues, an inadequate food delivery system, and an increasing number \nof unexplained resident injuries. (See Affidavits of Philip Corrigan, Albert Pizella, and \nJoseph A. Hughes attached hereto as Exhibit 14.) \nDuring the most recent fiscal year, the Defendants received over four hundred \nmillion dollars in Federal reimbursement (Federal Financial Participation) for \nprograms and services provided to retarded residents of the Commonwealth in \naccordance with the Medicaid program. A careful reading of the Federal Regulations \nthat govern participation for intermediate care facilities indicates that the Defendants \nmay jeopardize continued federal reimbursement for failing to substantially comply \nwith the following regulations established in accordance with 42 CFR Ch. IV (10-1-02 \nEdition) Subpart I §483.20 Client protections, §483.430 Facility staffing, §483.440 \nActive treatment services, §483.450 Client behavior and facility practices, §483.460 \n16 \n\nHealth care services, and §483.470 Physical environment. (See Code of Federal \nRegulations attached hereto as Exhibit 15.) \nReminiscent of the conditions that existed thirty years ago, in which parents \nand family members of residents privately donated funds to support activities, \nfurnishings, and the physical environment at Fernald, many family members today \nare in the same situation due to the lack of adequate funds and repairs so that they \nprivately pay for programs and services which are otherwise unavailable at Fernald. \n(See Affidavits of Diane Booher and Albert Pizella attached hereto as Exhibit 16.) \nIn addition, due to staff shortages, lack of supervision, and lack of preventative \nmaintenance programs, there has been a progressive and alarming physical \ndeterioration and loss of timely maintenance at Fernald, which has resulted in an \nincrease in safety issues, lack of medical attention, inconsistent transportation \nservices, elimination of recreation programs, unattended health issues, and a visible \nincrease in vermin and insects in residential areas. (See Affidavit of Dorothy \nO'Rourke attached hereto as Exhibit 17.) \nMany of the buildings at Fernald, which were partially or completely renovated \nin accordance with specific Orders of the Court, have unnecessarily and prematurely \nbeen closed, abandoned or leased to other government agencies, causing a \ndecrease in available bed capacity for Fernald residents. \n17 \n\nGovernor Romney's announced plan to close, during his administration, all of \nthe Developmental Centers which now provide housing for over a thousand retarded \nclass members is in sharp contrast to and directly contradicts the report by the \nDepartment of Mental Retardation's Facility Planning Working Group published in \n2002, which concluded that the future facility bed capacity needed in FY2011 will \nrequire a low bed capacity of 671 beds and, for the same period, estimated a high \nfacility bed capacity of 912 beds. (See Report of the DMR Facility Planning Working \nGroup (May 2002), Table II Summary of Projected Future Facility Bed Capacity \nNeeded attached hereto as Exhibit 18.) \nIn the spring of 2003, following the announcement by Governor Romney of his \ndecision to close the Fernald Developmental Center, DMR Commissioner Gerald J. \nMorrissey, Jr. established an eight-person Fernald Developmental Center Family \nAdvisory Committee of family members and guardians with the stated purpose to \n\"foster communication between DMR and the families regarding the closing of the \nfacility.\" In a written policy statement, Morrissey declared that \"Specifically, the \nDepartment will share information and solicit feedback with family members \nconcerning the current and proposed plans and activities related to the closing. \nCommittee members both individually and collectively will have the opportunity to \nmake suggestions and recommendations, seek clarification and request information \nthrough this structure.\" \n18 \n\nThereafter, for a period of twelve months, despite its stated goals for \ncooperation with the Plaintiffs' representatives, the Defendants repeatedly ignored \nrequests for information, limited the opportunity for and refused to consider issues for \ndiscussion, red lined Plaintiff's proposed agendas, and generally demeaned the \nopportunity for meaningful discussion and communication. (See Plaintiffs proposed \nagendas for Family Advisory Committee as redacted by the Defendants attached \nhereto as Exhibit 19.) \nOn June 8,2004, Commissioner Morrissey disbanded the Family Advisory \nCommittee. \nAlthough the Defendants frequently cite the closing of Belchertown State \nSchool in 1992 as an example and model for future closings of ICF-MRs, the \nprocedures that are presently being used to evict the residents at Fernald are totally \nopposite the procedures that were agreeably followed by previous administrations \nwith the support of parents and guardians of residents at Belchertown. (See Affidavit \nof Benjamin Ricci attached hereto as Exhibit 20.) \nThe Defendants have not substantially complied with the following \nrequirements of the Order: \n\"Except as set forth in other paragraphs of this Order, nothing in this Order is \nintended to detract from or limit the discretion of the defendants in developing and \nimproving programs, managing and determining the personnel and budget of the \nDepartment of Mental Retardation and other state agencies, implementing innovative \nservices, improving quality enhancement and dispute-resolution mechanisms, or \nallocating its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens.\" (Reference \nOrder paragraph 5) \n19 \n\nSince the Final Order was entered by the Court on May 25, 1993, the \nDefendants have systematically abused the discretion authorized by the Court by \npublicly alleging that there would be budget savings accomplished by closing of \nFernald Developmental Center and all other ICF-MRs; ignoring the concerns of the \nfamily advocacy organization at Fernald; limiting the subject matter proposed for \ndiscussion by the Family Advisory Committee; inappropriately establishing a process \nfor the sale to private developers of the 163 acre site at Fernald prior to the \ndevelopment of a humane plan to provide alternative housing for the current \nresidents; fully funding the Boulet and Rolland federally-mandated lawsuits while \nsubstantially reducing the available budget for the Ricci class action; politicizing the \nadmission policy at the Developmental Centers to accommodate the factors of \ninfluence and favoritism; the developm~nt of a Placement Profile process, which \ncircumvents and denigrates the established ISP process; and publicly criticizing the \nCourt's role in the Consent-Decree process.  (See Affidavit of Cathy Gover attached \nhereto as Exhibit 21.) \nThe unexpected announcement by Governor Romney to close all the existing \nICF-MRs beginning with Fernald, together with the attendant lack of long-term \nplanning, budget and staff reductions, failure since 1973 to certify in accordance with \nthe Court Order that \"the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better \nservices to meet their needs in the new location and that alllSP-recommended \nservices for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP are available at the \nnew location,\" unfilled long-term vacant staff positions, deferred ISP transfer \n20 \n\nhearings, introduction of a Placement Profile process that is not authorized by statute \nor regulation, administrative editing of residents' ISPs without prior notice to family \nmembers to guardians, loss of regular contact with family members due to increased \nand lengthy transportation issues, lack of capital improvements, delayed \nmaintenance and repair, and no effort to increase staff at alternative sites to which \nFernald residents are to be transferred, has resulted in systemic violations of the \nOrder that require equal or better lifetime services for those residents facing transfer \nto new locations.

Okin, et al.,\nDefendants\n___________________________________\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL RETARDATION’S STATUS REPORT \nTO THE COURT AND PRELIMINARY RESPONSE TO THE REPORT \nOF THE FERNALD PLAINTIFFS FILED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2006\nIntroduction\nThe Department of Mental Retardation (“the Department”) submits this status report\nregarding the Department’s implementation of its plan to close the Fernald Developmental Center\n(“Fernald”) and the status of the individuals who have been transferred from Fernald to community\nsettings or other Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (\"ICFs/MR\").  Further, the\nDepartment hereby responds preliminarily to the Plaintiffs' Report to the Court in Accordance with\nOrder of January 20, 2005 Relative to the Transfer Between February 26, 2003 and June 22, 2005\nof 43 Residents from the Fernald Developmental Center to an Alternative Placement (hereinafter,\n“the Plaintiffs' Report”).1\nThe planned closure of Fernald is consistent with the long-standing policy commitment of\nthe Department of Mental Retardation (“DMR”) to favor community-based settings for individuals\nwho can handle and benefit from them and to reduce its reliance upon traditional institutions for\n1  As the Department received the Plaintiffs' report on February 2, 2006, a mere four business days\nprior to the court’s scheduled status conference, it specifically reserves the right to supplement this\nResponse. \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 2 of 30\nadults with mental retardation.  This policy commitment, in addition to furthering the goals of the\nMay 25, 1993 Final Order specifying that the Department’s clients receive services in the least\nrestrictive environment possible, is also consistent with national trends and the decision of the U.S.\nSupreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\nPlacements from Fernald\nThe Department has fully complied with this Court’s Final Order of May 1993, ensuring\nthat all individuals transferred from Fernald into community residential settings are receiving\n“equal or better” care in the new settings.  See Affidavit Of Diane Enochs, ¶10.  The Department\nhas placed 49 individuals from Fernald into either community settings or alternative ICF/MR\nsettings.2  Id. at ¶ 6.  All placements were voluntary, and were consented to by the individual’s\nlegally authorized guardian.  For those 9 individuals whose families have chosen community\nplacements, the transition processes have been thoughtful and caring.  Those individuals have\nadjusted well to their new settings, and are being provided an array of opportunities and\nexperiences which would not have been available to them at Fernald and have resulted in an\nimproved quality of life.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 12.  \nFor those 34 individuals reviewed by Plaintiffs whose families have chosen to transfer to\nthe Wrentham or Monson Developmental Centers, or to the Hogan Regional Center, the full\narray of ICF/MR services supplied there by knowledgeable and caring staff are equal to services\nprovided at Fernald, and in most cases have resulted in improved opportunities for community\noutings and more spacious living quarters for individuals.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 13.  These factors have\n2  In February 2003, at the time of the announced closure of Fernald, the ICF/MR facility census\nwas 280 residents.   As of February 1, 2006, the census is 198 residents.  Several of the\ntransferred Fernald Class Members have gone to skilled nursing facilities or are now deceased.\n-2-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 3 of 30\nresulted in a high level of satisfaction expressed by individuals and their families and guardians.3 \nEnochs Aff., ¶ 14.  \nSeveral individuals have indicated that community placement allows individuals to\nexperience new activities such as outings into the community to stores, the bank, etc.    Enochs\nAff., ¶¶ 15-16.  For many individuals, the transition process itself proved uneventful, and the\navailability of familiar staff to assist with the transition has ameliorated the adjustment period for\nindividuals where needed.  Id., ¶¶ 17, 84.  \nFor some individuals in the community or at another ICF/MR, the moves have placed them\nin much closer proximity to their families, allowing more time for visiting siblings and elderly\nparents.  In particular for some aging parents with transportation challenges, this has proven very\nbeneficial.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 18.  Without minimizing in any way the potential for transfers to be\ndisrupting, many of the individuals transferred and their families have expressed a clear view that\nthe moves, while requiring adjustments, have been extremely positive for the class members and\ntheir families.   Id. at ¶ 15.  Most families and guardians have articulated a high degree of\nsatisfaction with the new services.  Id. at ¶¶ 19, 23.  \nThere have been six deaths among those transferred over the last three years.  Given the ages\nof the individuals involved and the serious underlying medical conditions which were identified in\neach mortality review report, the deaths were not unusual or surprising.   Enochs Aff., ¶ 27.  They\nwere not related in any way to the move from Fernald.  Id.  \n3  Services at all the Department’s ICFs/MR, including Wrentham, Hogan and Monson, continue to\ncomply with the requirements of Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  Title XIX surveys were\nrecently completed at Hogan and Wrentham; the federal reviewers did not assess either facility as\nbeing deficient in any aspect of client care.  Enochs Aff., ¶¶ 8-9.              \n-3-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 4 of 30\nPlacement Planning for Fernald Class Members\nOn January 20, 2005, this Court approved a Stipulation between the parties, requiring the\nbifurcation of the individual service planning (\"ISP\") process into two steps:  (1) discussion of all\nof the elements of the individual’s service plan, but excluding any discussion of placement in a less\nrestrictive setting; and (2) a separate meeting to discuss placement planning.   See Stipulation dated\nJanuary 20, 2005.  The Court further directed, in the hearing, that the Department notify class\ncounsel of the dates of all ISPs for Fernald residents and of the dates of placement planning\nmeetings for those individuals represented by class counsel.  Representation by class counsel was\nindicated by the guardian’s execution of a release allowing the Fernald League to participate in the\nISP meeting.  The Department has scrupulously complied with these requirements, refraining from\nany discussion of placement at the ISP meeting, and notifying class counsel of ISP dates and\nplacement planning meetings dates, even though class counsel has not chosen to appear at any such\nmeeting.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 48.  \nAs this Court is well aware, the importance of the ISP to the effective delivery of services\nto individuals cannot be overstated.  Effective service planning and communication by all team\nmembers on all the issues required in the Department’s ISP regulations is essential to the well-being\nand quality of life for the individual.  The bifurcation of the ISP, while intended to address the\nFernald plaintiffs' October 2004 allegations concerning the ISP process,4 has had two major\nunintended consequences.  Enochs Aff., ¶¶ 49-57.  \nFirst, ISPs at Fernald, developed by the ISP team, including the family, are not being\nfinalized because the advice of class counsel and the Fernald League is to avoid finalizing the ISP\n4  The Department addressed those concerns in its brief filed with the Court on August 16, 2004.\nA recent hearing appeal decision confirms that many of the plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the\nediting of appeals or decrease in services were specious.  See Enochs Aff., ¶ 66.\n-4-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 5 of 30\nby filing an appeal, thus delaying any placement planning meeting.   This advice is clearly stated\nin a May 2, 2005, flyer from the Fernald League: \nDMR is not to discuss placement until the ISP is “finalized,” \naccording to Judge Joseph Tauro on April 7, 2005.\n“Finalized” means your ward’s 2005 ISP is not under appeal\nnot in the process of being written\nand not due between now and January 2006.\nSee Exhibit A, attached hereto.  This strategy of avoiding placement planning meetings by appealing\nthe ISP is clearly reflected in the dramatic increase in the number of ISP appeals filed at Fernald in\nthe past year.  The number of appeals for the past five years is as follows:\nYear No. of ISP Appeals Filed\n2001 1\n2002 0\n2003 3\n2004 15\n2005 46\n   \nEnochs Aff., ¶ 64.  Further, the strategy of appealing the ISP, even where no substantive issues are\nidentified for the appeal, is reflected in the appeals themselves.  Guardians, advised by the League\nto do so, appeal the ISP without indicating any specific issues until the day of the appeal, and even\nthen appear unsure what they are appealing.5   Id. at ¶¶ 59, 65, 69-70.  The substance of these\nappeals, when they are brought to hearing, is frequently trivial and could easily have been remedied\nthrough communication.  Id. at ¶ 66.  In one recent appeal, the sole issue was whether a particular\nbrand of soft drink should be included in the ISP Vision Statement.  Id.\nMoreover, scheduling conflicts and cancellation of informal conferences and hearing dates\n5    Appellants  instead  indicate  all  nine  (9)  bases  for  appeal,  including  “eligibility”  and\n“prioritization,” which clearly are not issues for any class member at Fernald. \n-5-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 6 of 30\nmeans that months potentially go by before the appeal is heard.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 60.  Although the\nDepartment can move to expeditiously schedule hearings, its usual practice is to allow reasonable\nextensions for good cause.  Id., ¶ 61.  In the past year, however, there have been numerous requests\nto re-scheduled both informal conferences and hearing dates.  Additionally, the hearings are\nfrequently unfocused due to the appellant’s failure to identify the issues appealed, and may go on\nfor several days.6  Id., ¶ 62.  \nThe Department does not dispute the right of any appellant to use the administrative process\nto resolve issues presented in the ISP, nor would it suggest that this Court alter those due process\nrights.  However, the second major unintended consequence of the bifurcation of the ISP process,\nlinked to the Fernald League’s strategy of avoiding finalization of the ISP through baseless appeals,\nis a broad, systemic inability to satisfy (1) the Department’s regulations requiring consideration\nthrough the ISP process of service delivery in the least restrictive service setting (see 115 CMR\n§§ 6.00, et seq.), and (2) the Supreme Court's mandate in Olmstead that States provide services for\nindividuals with disabilities in the least restrictive setting available.  The result is that families are\nnot being included in the placement planning process and are not becoming aware of community\nor facility placement options that are available for their family members.  The Fernald League has\neffectively stifled the Fernald staff’s communication with families about this important matter, in\nviolation of existing law and contrary to clearly expressed public policy.7 \n6  A recent decision by Hearing Officer John Riley illustrates this pattern.  See Enochs Aff., ¶ 62. \n  \n   \n7  The Fernald League does not acknowledge that discussion about community placement  at ISPs\nis consistent with the law and DMR practice.  The Fernald League complains that “DMR employees\nat receiving facilities documented that they discussed community placement with guardians as early\nas three weeks after their wards were transferred from Fernald.”  Plaintiffs' Report at 12.  This is\ncorrect because it is the standard practice at all ICFs/MR, except Fernald, to have discussions about\nless restrictive alternatives in the ISP meeting.  This does not mean that individuals are being pushed\n(continued...)\n-6-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 7 of 30\nThe Department respectfully submits that whatever curative aspects the Stipulation may have\nhad with regard to the ISP process at Fernald has now been achieved, and it is presently operating\nmainly to thwart communication between the Department and families.  The Stipulation should be\nvacated, and the normal ISP process allowed to operate for all Fernald residents. \nContinued  Improvements in Programming\nand the Environment at Fernald Development Center\nThe Department has continued, and expanded, the efforts outlined in its Response to\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Re-Open Case (notwithstanding the motion having been denied by this Court\non January 20, 2005), to improve the physical environment and programming at Fernald during this\nwinding-down period.  Enochs Aff., ¶¶ 35, 42-44.  Under the supervision of Facility Director Linda\nMontminy, the physical environment of Fernald continues to improve.  With the re-organization of\nthe facility's administrative divisions, Division Directors have taken direct responsibility for all\nphysical environment concerns.  Id., ¶ 37.  Major renovations to Malone Park, an area of Fernald\nwhich will be converted from an ICF/MR to community-based residences (with 24 residents) are\nnow underway.  Id., ¶ 44.\nDevelopment of Housing Opportunities for Fernald Residents\nWhen it comes to providing housing services in the community for Fernald class members\nwho might choose to transfer from Fernald in the next two years, there is significant available\nresidential capacity in the Department’s state-operated system, as well as in its provider-operated\nprograms.  In addition, the Department is actively involved in a housing development process, in\npartnership with the state Division of Capital Asset Management (“DCAM”), the Department of\n(...continued)\ninto community placements, but it assures that they are aware of opportunities for community\nplacement.   \n-7-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 8 of 30\nHousing and Community Development (“DHCD”), and local housing authorities, that will meet the\npresent and future needs of individuals served by the Department.  Residential housing capacity that\nis developed through this initiative (known as the Chapter 689 or Housing for People with Special\nNeeds program) will further add to the inventory of adaptable and fully accessible housing available\nin the DMR system.  \nThe most significant challenge in developing housing to meet Class Members' needs at this\ntime is the bifurcation of the ISP and placement planning processes, resulting in families and\nguardians having no contact with the Department about their ward/family member’s housing needs\nor preferences.  Only with reasonably full input from families can the Department develop\ncommunity-based housing that meets the geographic needs or preferences of families.  Furthermore,\ninvolvement by families offers the opportunity for substantial input in the development of a home-\nlike environment for their family member.     \nThe Department’s Preliminary Response to the Fernald Plaintiffs' \n“Report to the Court in Accordance With the Order of January 20, 2005”\nAt the outset, it should be noted that Plaintiffs' styling of their \"Report\" erroneously implies\nthat the Court’s Order of January 20, 2005, called for or authorized the Fernald League Plaintiffs\nto conduct a review of the 43 transferees from Fernald on behalf of the Court.  The January 20th\nOrder simply allowed the Fernald Plaintiffs' counsel and class representatives to review certain\nrecords of the transferees; it did not direct the Fernald plaintiffs to conduct this review. \nThis “Report” was distributed to many media outlets on the day of its filing with the Court,\nand one may infer that the Plaintiffs' characterization of the “Report” was deliberately intended to\nimbue it with the imprimatur of Court authorization and so to lend credibility to the Plaintiffs'\nreview.  In fact, it is not the report of an independent entity authorized by the Court to investigate\n-8-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 9 of 30\nthe transfers; rather, it is the filing of a party with a highly publicized goal of keeping the Fernald\nDevelopmental Center open indefinitely.\nEach issue identified in the “Report” will be addressed in detail below.  As an overview, the\nDepartment offers the following responses to the Fernald League’s key points: \n(cid:35) Plaintiffs were provided with all the documentation required to be disclosed under\nthe Stipulation and Order for the Protection of Confidential Information.  Plaintiffs\nsubsequently requested access to broad categories of confidential documents outside\nthe terms of the Protective Order, and the Department's counsel appropriately denied\nthose requests.  The Department, however, invited Plaintiffs to resubmit more\nindividualized  information  requests  directed  toward  an  individual-specific\ndetermination of whether services were “equal or better,” but they declined to do so.\nPlaintiffs' counsel also chose not to seek in this Court to modify the Stipulation and\nshould not now be heard to complain about the Department's faithful adherence to\nthe terms of the Stipulation. \n(cid:35) Plaintiffs have not complied with this Court’s order of January 20, 2005, to bring\nspecific issues relating to the ISPs of the 43 transferred individual to the Department\nfor potential resolution.  Plaintiffs' counsel's perfunctory presentation of unspecified\ncomplaints to the Department on January 18, 2006, and his statement that he desired\nno further review or discussion with the Department, demonstrates bad faith in\ncomplying with this Court’s directive.    \n(cid:35) To the extent that the “Report” addresses the issue of whether the 43 transferees have\nreceived “equal or better” services in their new location (Report at 11) – and there\nis little concrete data in this “Report” that addresses this most fundamental issue –\n-9-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 10 of 30\nit fails to establish any reduction in services either before or after transfer.\n(cid:35) Allegations that individuals have suffered “medical, emotional or behavioral changes\nshortly before or after transfer” (Report at 13) are factually unsupported.  Plaintiffs'\n“case studies” (Report at 14-18) contain recitations of individual diagnoses and\nconditions, and of challenges and objectives which exist for many Fernald residents,\nboth those who have been transferred and those who have not.  The existence of\nphysical and behavioral challenges does not establish that individuals who have\ntransferred from Fernald have suffered any “trauma” as a result.8\n(cid:35) On several topics, Plaintiffs' Report consists of nothing more than a rehash of legal\narguments that they advanced in their July 2004 Motion to Re-Open the Case, which\nwas subsequently denied by this Court.  See, e.g., Report at page 4 (the section\nentitled “No Certification of Equal or Better”).  \n(cid:35) The Fernald League’s “recommendation” that the individuals transferred from\nFernald – individuals who voluntarily transferred with the consent of their legally\nauthorized guardian and who have not requested a return to Fernald  – should be\nordered returned to Fernald is contrary to black-letter law that clearly vests the\nauthority to consent to an individual’s services in a particular setting with the\nindividual’s guardian – and not with Class Counsel or the Fernald League.  It is\nfurthermore contrary to the interests of the individuals themselves to suggest a\ntransfer from their current settings where, as the Department’s affidavit amply\ndemonstrates, they are thriving and benefiting from newly available services.\n8  Plaintiffs stated in their brief meeting with the Department on January 18, 2006, that they had\nnot undertaken any “clinical review” of the transferees.  Yet plaintiffs would have this Court\nbelieve that the existence of the diagnoses in the transferees is causally related to the transfer.\n-10-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 11 of 30\n(cid:35) The Plaintiffs' Report also contains mischaracterizations and selective quotations\nfrom the transcripts of this Court’s prior hearings, in an effort to imply that the\nDepartment failed to comply with a court order requiring the documentation of any\nFernald resident’s right to return to an ICF/MR.   See Plaintiffs' Report at 4-5 (the\n“Right  to  Return  letter”  section).    Plaintiffs  then  urge  that  the  Department's\nCommissioner be held in contempt of court.  The Department, however, is in full\ncompliance with the orders of this Court, as will be further demonstrated below.  \n(cid:35) Plaintiffs' allegations that the Department has not complied with federal regulations\n(Report at 5-6) are based upon their misreading of regulations that do not apply to\nICF/MR facilities such as Fernald.  In effect, Plaintiffs assert that the Department has\nfailed  to  comply  with  nursing  home  discharge  regulations,  which  are  plainly\ninapplicable to the transfer discharges from Fernald.\n(cid:35) Plaintiffs' allegations of non-compliance with regulations, such as the alleged\nprocedural deficiencies in the 45-day transfer notice process (Report at 7-10), and\nthe alleged failure to document “informed consent” to transfer (Report at 9-10), are\nbased upon plaintiffs' incorrect interpretation of the Department’s regulations. \nDMR's MORE DETAILED RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS' ALLEGATIONS\nA. The Department Complied with the Court’s Orders and Provided the Documentation\nDescribed in the Protective Order.                                                                             \nAs noted in earlier court filings, following this Court’s Status Conference on January 20,\n2005, Fernald Class Counsel and Department attorneys met on at least five occasions to discuss\nwhich materials should be part of Class Counsel’s review of the Department's provision of \"equal\nor better services\" and should therefore fall within the parameters of the Proposed Protective Order.\n-11-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 12 of 30\nFollowing agreement of the parties regarding the parameters of the Proposed Protective Order, this\nCourt entered an Order on June 15, 2005, precisely identifying the materials to be made available\nfor Class Counsel’s review of the Department's provision of \"equal or better services\" to transferring\nFernald residents.  Class Counsel and two representatives from the Fernald League reviewed the\nconfidential material specified in the Protective Order on July 12th, July 13th, July 20th, July 21st,\nAugust 24th, September 1st, and November 18th.  \nOn August 18th, Class Counsel requested by letter a broad range of additional confidential\ninformation, indisputably outside the parameters of the Protective Order, concerning each Class\nMember who had transferred from the Fernald Developmental Center.  This extensive request for\nconfidential data protected from disclosure by law was not authorized by the Court, or the Class\nMembers themselves, and the request did not specify any particular Class Member for whom the\nadditional information was necessary to complete the \"equal or better care\"  review.   The\nDepartment responded to this request on September 26th and October 5th and informed Class Counsel\nthat most of the information he requested was beyond the scope of the Protective Order and\ncontained personal identifying information that the Department was not able to divulge.9  The\nDepartment acknowledged, however, that the Court instructed the parties to confer in certain limited\ninstances to determine if additional documentation would assist Class Counsel in assessing whether\na particular Class Member is receiving equal or better care elsewhere.  Accordingly, Department\ncounsel specifically invited Class Counsel to call her to discuss these or other pertinent issues.  On\nNovember 9th, the Department again invited Class Counsel to discuss the issues related to the\n9  On June 15, 2005, this Court acknowledged that the parties had worked hard in coming to an\nagreement, and that further efforts to expand the scope of disclosure of confidential information\nwould be looked at “very, very closely,” and the Stipulation would be “interpret[ed] in a strict\nmanner.”  Transcript of June 15, 2005, hearing at pp. 9-10.   \n-12-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 13 of 30\nprovision of equal or better care to Fernald Class Members who have pursued an alternative\nplacement.  Class Counsel did not respond to the Department’s invitations to discuss these issues.\n   \nB. The Fernald League Has Not Complied With The Final Order’s Dispute Resolution\nRequirements.                                                                                                            \n   \nOn January 20, 2005, this Court indicated to the Fernald League that upon its completion of\nits record review of the 43 transferees, it was to comply with the dispute resolution  requirements\nof the 1993 Final Order, paragraph 7 (c), and thus bring any concerns it identified first to the\nDepartment for potential resolution.  Transcript of Court hearing of January 20, 2005, at pages 44-\n45.   On January 18, 2006, Class Counsel briefly articulated the issues identified in the Plaintiffs'\nReport in a one-hour oral presentation to the Commissioner and other staff.  When Department\nofficials indicated that they would like the opportunity to address Class Counsel’s concerns, and to\nengage in further discussion of identified issues, Class Counsel promptly declined the offer, stating\nthat he was “done” and was uninterested in any further communication.  This perfunctory and\nblatant attempt to avoid the processes required under Paragraph 7 (c) of the 1993 Final Order was\nin clear violation of the Final Order, and this Court’s directive of January 20, 2005, and should not\nbe countenanced.   Further, as the examples below illustrate, a meaningful discussion regarding\nparticular individuals and their current needs could have dispelled the notion that services were\nbeing  reduced,  or  at  least  afforded  the  Department  an  opportunity  for  a  more  informed\nunderstanding  of  certain  individuals'  needs  and,  if  corrections  were  necessary,  a  chance  to\nimplement improvements.  Clearly, however, Plaintiffs' Counsel had a different agenda in mind. \n  C. Services Provided to the 43 Transferees in Their New Settings Were “Equal to or\nBetter” Than the Services Provided Before the Transfer.                                         \n    Services provided to the 43 individuals transferred from Fernald and reviewed by Class\n-13-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 14 of 30\nCounsel were certified by Fernald's Director, Linda Montminy, to be \"equal or better\" through her\nsigning of the individual’s ISP.   Enochs Aff., ¶ 10.   The process of comparing the services that will\nbe provided in the new setting with those services in the Fernald ISP is well established and is\napplied to every transfer.  Id.  If there are active treatment objectives that exist at the time of\ntransfer, they must be addressed in the new setting, and the Facility Director is responsible for\nensuring that this occurs.  Id.  In each case, the Department engaged in a thorough review of service\nneeds and ultimately issued a certification that “equal or better” services could be offered in a\ndifferent setting.  Id.  Tellingly, not a single Fernald Class Member now in a community setting\n(personally or via his or her guardian or relatives) has requested a return to an ICF/MR.  Id., ¶ 11.\nThe Plaintiffs' Report asserts that:\nThe record review clearly established that there were documented instances when a\nresident’s services at Fernald were reduced prior to a transfer as well as following\na transfer from Fernald, including failures to provide wheelchairs, recreational\nservices, 24-hour nursing care, speech and occupational therapy.\nIn  addition,  the  frequency  and  duration  of  active  treatment  objectives  either\ndecreased after transfer or were otherwise defined in non-specific terms.  Further, it\nwas established that treatment objectives were individualized before transfer and\ngeneric after transfer.    \nId. at 11.  The Fernald League supports these broad assertions with three examples.  See id.  First,\nit should be noted that the examples chosen address only one issue – the difference in the language\nused in the objectives for three individuals.  There is no evidence whatsoever of a failure to provide\nwheelchairs, recreational services, 24-hour nursing care, speech or occupational therapy.  Indeed,\nthe summary reviews provided by the Department demonstrate that in several instances (most\nnotably, one resident's move to the Wrentham Developmental Center), staff at the new facility\nacquired new equipment for a transferring Fernald Class Member (e.g., a new electric wheelchair\n-14-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 15 of 30\nfor the resident who moved to Wrentham).  \nSecond, Plaintiffs' examples do not support the allegation that services have been reduced.\nThe third example was presented to the Department at the parties’ January 18th meeting.  As the\nDepartment explained in that meeting, the individual objectives of ‘increasing [ . . . ] consistency\nin flushing the toilet” and “brushing teeth more completely” were changed in the ISP developed for\nthis individual after the transfer because the individual was consistently meeting the original\nobjective.  New objectives to “actively engage in offered activities” and “become familiar with and\nuse his residence independently or with staff’s verbal prompt” were appropriate new objectives not\nfound in the prior ISP.   Enochs Aff., ¶ 32.  The other two examples of “reducing services” cited in\nPlaintiffs'  Report  also  reflect  appropriate  developmental  changes.   Id.,  ¶  33.    It  would  be\ninappropriate to do as the  Fernald League suggests, to retain objectives that have been achieved as\npart of the ISP.  ISP objectives should not remain static over time if an individual progresses.  Id.\nFinally, the Fernald League attaches “Case Stud[ies] 1-6,” presumably to support their\nallegations that services have been reduced or that individuals have suffered as a result of the\ntransfer.  However, each “Case Study” is simply a recitation of language presumably found in an\nindividual’s ISP, with no reference to when it applies – prior to or after transfer – or of the relevant\ncontext.  See Plaintiffs' Report at 14-19.  The case studies do not prove a violation of anything.   \nD. There Is No Factual Support For Plaintiffs' Allegations That Individuals Have\nSuffered As A Result Of Transfer And A Review Of The Transfers By The U.S.\nDepartment  Of  Justice  Would  Be  Duplicative  Of  Other  Existing  Review\nMechanisms.                                                                                                              \nPlaintiffs offer no competent evidentiary support for their serious allegation that individuals\nsuffered medical, emotional, or behavioral changes before or after transfer.  See Plaintiffs' Report\nat 14.  Again, the Fernald League’s “Case Studies” (Report at 14-18) contain recitations of\n-15-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 16 of 30\nindividual diagnoses and conditions, of challenges and objectives, which exist for many Fernald\nresidents, both those who have been transferred and those who have not.  These descriptions of\nconditions are not unusual for any Fernald resident, and the existence of physical and behavioral\nchallenges does not establish that individuals who have been transferred have suffered any of these\nconditions as a result of their transfer.   \nIn its “Recommendations” section, the Fernald League calls for an external review by the\nUnited States Department of Justice into the transfer process and services provided to Ricci Class\nMembers who have been transferred from Fernald.  (Plaintiffs' Report at 20).  Such a review would\nbe unnecessary and over-reaching since federal law already provides oversight and review of both\ncommunity-based services and Title XIX facility services, as well as of transfer and discharge\nprocesses, by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS”).  Furthermore, the provisions\nof the Final Order already require external review of community-based services.\n1. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Already Conducts External Review\nof Class Members’ Services.\n  Title XIX surveys are regularly conducted on behalf of the federal Center for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services, through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, at each of the\nDepartment’s Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICFs/MR).   These surveys\ninvolve a comprehensive on-site review of all services provided to individuals, the physical\nenvironment, and all aspects of compliance with federal requirements to operate an ICF/MR.  Each\nof the Department’s ICFs/MR have been the subject of recent surveys and have been determined to\nbe in full compliance with requirements of the Title XIX program.  Enochs Aff., ¶¶ 45-46.\nSubsequent to the Final Order, CMS also developed and implemented a quality review\nprocess  for  the  Department's  home  and  community-based  services.    CMS’s  review  of  the\n-16-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 17 of 30\nDepartment’s Home and Community-Based Waiver Program was last completed in 2002, and\nprovided a comprehensive analysis of community services.  In December of 2005, CMS contacted\nthe Department to inform it that CMS would be conducting another review of all home and\ncommunity-based services in February of 2006.  The Department is currently engaged in that review\nand expects that the final report will be wholly positive.  \n2. The “Periodic Review” of Community-Based Services Required Under the\nFinal Order Provides For An Additional External Review of the Quality of\nServices for Those Individuals Transferred from Fernald to the Community.\nParagraph 2 (e) of the 1993 Final Order requires that “[w]ithin nine months of the date of\nthis  Order,  defendants  shall  enter  into  an  agreement  with  contracted  consultant  retardation\nprofessionals or with a nationally recognized evaluation group to review community programs on\na periodic basis.”   In addition to the internal quality assurance activities that the Department\nroutinely conducts, and which are summarized in the Annual Quality Assurance Report published\nby the Office of Quality Enhancement (and available on the DMR website), the Department has\ncollaborated with many independent professionals and organizations to evaluate its community\nservice system.  \nFrom approximately 1987 to 1995, the Department contracted with Seaside Associates to\nconduct “Independent Professional Reviews” of services delivered in the community.  From 1997\nthrough the present, the Department has participated in the “National Core Indicators Project,”10 a\ncollaboration  among  member  state  agencies  of  the  National  Association  of  Directors  of\nDevelopmental Disability Services (working through the Human Services Research Institute or\n\"HSRI\"), to develop a systematic approach to performance and outcome measurement.  Through\n10  Currently, CMS is also considering the National Core Indicators model for future reviews of the\nDepartment's community-based services.     \n-17-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 18 of 30\ntheir collaboration with HSRI, participating states develop consensus around the quality outcomes\nmost important to measure.  Participating states take part in consumer and family surveys across an\narray of settings.  Results are tabulated by state and averaged nationally, allowing for states to\nbenchmark their performance against nationally recognized quality indicators. \nFrom 1997 through 2003, as part of this project with HSRI, the Department has periodically\ncontracted with Boston University (as a subcontractor to HSRI) to conduct telephone and mail\nconsumer surveys to evaluate the quality of both facility-based and community-based residential\nservices using the NCI tool.  The Department has also contracted with professionals to conduct in-\nperson interviews with family and guardians and, where possible, individuals receiving services.\nAnalysis of the consumer and family surveys and interview data is performed by HSRI using the\nNCI data.   \nIn addition, the Department has conducted consumer surveys, using NCI, as administered\nby the Office of Quality Management (“OQM”),11 for analysis by HSRI.  The Department has\nspecifically contracted with HSRI to sample Ricci class members residing in the community and in\nthe Department’s ICF/MR facilities.   Published results of HSRI studies are publicly available on-\nline at the HSRI website.\nIn addition to these reviews of community services, the Department has contracted with\nvarious consultant experts to review particular aspects of its community services for quality\nassurance purposes.  Additional oversight and evaluative studies of various aspects of the services\ndelivery system have been conducted by: \n11\n    All DMR Quality Management surveyors are mandated reporters and are required to report any\nsuspected allegations of abuse or neglect to the DPPC.  Further, the results of the NCI surveys, as\nwell as multiple other sources of quality assurance data, are integrated into the DMR Annual Quality\nAssurance Report for review by management. \n-18-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 19 of 30\n(cid:33) The Governor’s Commission on Mental Retardation – Pursuant to Executive Order,\nthe Commission is authorized to receive information on systems issues and policies;\nit also receives and investigates complaints, and makes recommendations to the\nDepartment about service delivery.  The Governor’s Commission has published\nreports on the availability of durable medical equipment and assistive technology to\nindividuals in the community; and the\n \n(cid:33) Disabled  Persons  Protection  Commission  –    Publishes  quarterly  statistical\nevaluations on complaints, investigations and outcomes of complaints, which it\ninvestigates.  \nAdditionally, the Department participates in a national policy study regarding financing and\nprogramming trends in the United States.  An annual AAMR publication entitled “The State of the\nStates in Developmental Disabilities,” contains data regarding these trends.  Data are collected from\neach state’s principal mental retardation / developmental disabilities agency to assess trends in the\nstructure and financing of developmental disabilities services. \nAlthough this list is not exhaustive, the Department submits that there are already in place\nadequate independent, external reviews of the Department’s community programs, including those\nprograms to which the Fernald class members have transferred.  The plaintiffs' recommendation for\nyet another layer of review should be rejected.\nE. The Department Has Complied With the Final Order’s Requirement of Certification\nof \"Equal Or Better\" Services in the New Setting.                                                    \nThe Fernald League’s contention that the Department is not complying with the equal or\nbetter certification requirement was made in its July 2004 Motion to Reopen and Restore Case to\nActive Docket, and the Department replied to this allegation in both the Defendant’s Opposition to\nPlaintiff’s Motion to Re-open and Restore Case to Active Docket and to Enforce the Final Order of\nMay 12, 1993 (hereinafter “Opposition”), and the affidavits of John Riley and Diane Enochs\nsubmitted therewith.  In response to this filing, the Department expressly incorporates herein the\nOpposition and its supporting affidavits.  See Opposition at 10.  In sum, DMR understands and is\n-19-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 20 of 30\ndischarging its obligations under the Final Order to certify “equal or better” services.  Under the\nFinal Order, all transfers of Ricci class members from one residential setting to another must be\nreviewed by DMR’s Regional Director or the Facility Director to ensure compliance with the Final\nOrder’s requirement that transferred individuals receive services equal to, or better able to meet their\nneeds in the new location than, the services they were receiving in the old location.  Final Order at\n¶ 4.  Certification that the “equal-or-better” requirement has been met has been made in different\nforms, including the transfer form and the ISP.  However, DMR’s practice for Ricci class members\nhas consistently been that the Facility Director or the Regional Director (or the Area Director for\nthe Regional Director) certifies when signing the ISP that a transferred Ricci class member’s\nservices meet the “equal or better” standard.  In its most recent filing, the Fernald League quotes the\nCourt as stating that the phrase “equal or better” is well-understood.  The Department agrees with\nthe Court, and affirms that it is currently certifying such services as equal or better. \nF. The Department Has Provided Guardians and Families Leaving Fernald With A\n“Right-to-Return” Letter.                                                                                           \n \nPrior to the recent litigation in this matter, the Department, in a letter sent to Class Counsel,\nvoluntarily agreed that the Department would honor any request by an individual placed from\nFernald into a community setting, if dissatisfied with the community placement, to return to an\nICF/MR setting other than the Fernald Developmental Center.  See Attachment B.  This voluntary\ncommitment was discussed at the April 7, 2005, hearing, and more recently at the June 15, 2005,\nhearing.  See Transcript excerpt attached as Exhibit C, at pp. 12-16.  The Department has provided\nletters to individual transferees consistent with its commitment and placed them within the\nindividual’s client file.12   The Department did not understand its obligation to be to provide a right-\n12  Individuals who had already been transferred from Fernald prior to June 15, 2005, and who had\n(continued...)\n-20-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 21 of 30\nto-return letter to someone who had transferred prior to these hearing dates; prior to the Spring of\n2005, the Department understood that this practice was voluntary and not court-ordered.  See Exhibit\nC (transcript) at 14.   However, it has provided every individual who has left Fernald since June 15,\n2005, with such a letter.  The process is consistent and not \"ad hoc,\" as the Court warned against on\nJune 15, 2005.  The Department therefore believes that it is in full compliance with this Court’s\ndirection with regard to these letters. \nG. Plaintiffs Incorrectly Interpret Federal and State Regulations Concerning “Unmet\nNeeds.”                                                                                                                       \nIn their Report, the Plaintiffs incorrectly assert that the Department’s policy decision to close\nFernald is in violation of federal regulations because the 43 transfers did not satisfy the criteria\ncontained within 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 483.12.  In the first instance, plaintiffs are\nincorrect because the cited regulations do not apply to intermediate care facilities for the mentally\nretarded (“ICFs/MR”); rather they pertain to admission, discharge and transfer standards for skilled\nnursing facilities (“SNFs”) or nursing facilities (“NFs”).  The standards for admission, discharge and\ntransfer of residents of ICFs/MR are not found within this regulation.\nThe Department operates the Commonwealth’s ICFs/MR in accordance with the provisions\nof federal Title XIX, state law, and DMR regulations.  Neither Title XIX, nor state law or\nregulations, require that an individual’s transfer from an ICF/MR be based solely upon an\nindividual’s “unmet active treatment needs.”   \nMore importantly, Plaintiffs note that in none of the 43 individual ISPs reviewed were there\n(...continued)\nnot requested a ‘right-to-return letter” would likely not have such a letter in their file as it was not\nunderstood prior to then to be a court-ordered requirement.  Any individual from Fernald who\nrequests a return to an ICF/MR, however, would see that request honored.  But none have made such\na request to date.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 7.     \n-21-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 22 of 30\nany identified “unmet needs.”  Report at 6.  This is not surprising because the Department is\nrequired under law to meet all the needs of Ricci class members, and Ricci class members should\nnever have “unmet needs.”  Under the terms of the Final Order, the Department is required to meet\nall support needs of individuals residing in the ICFs/MR, regardless of the availability of resources.\nWhile individuals reside at Fernald, the Department provides appropriate services to meet their\nsupport needs.  This practice continues when an individual leaves Fernald to reside in another\nsetting.  \nH. Plaintiffs'  Allegations  of  Non-compliance  with  Regulations,  Such  as  Alleged\nProcedural Deficiencies in the 45-day Transfer, and the Alleged Failure to \nDocument “Informed Consent” to Transfer, Are Based Upon Plaintiffs' \nIncorrect Interpretation of the Department’s Regulations.                                        \n1. The transfers of all Fernald Class Members followed thorough planning\nprocedures and consultation with individuals, guardians and family members.\nFamily members, guardians, and Class Members communicate with the Department in a\nvariety of ways and, as such, placement wishes and desires are addressed in many different ways.\nIn many instances, communications between guardians and Department staff are, for the most part,\noral in nature.  A guardian’s consent to a proposed residential transfer is evidenced by the\nindividual’s signature upon the consent forms that were subject to review by Class Counsel.  Since\nfamily members and guardians have been aware for some time that the Fernald Center is closing,\nmany have proceeded with planning for alternative placements for their wards.  \n2. All transfers were consented to by legal guardians. \nAll transfers of Fernald Class members were made pursuant to a signed consent form from\nthe individual, and/or the individual’s guardian(s).  During the meeting of January 18, 2006, Class\nCounsel did not provide any information concerning specific guardians or family members of\nFernald Class Members that he contends did not receive proper notice of the transfer meetings or\n-22-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 23 of 30\ndid not consent to the residential transfer.  Plaintiffs’ report is also devoid of such information.\n3. The notice and request for proposed facility transfer letter utilized by the\nDepartment meets all regulatory requirements concerning notice and consent.\n  \n       State  law  and  DMR  regulations  provide guidance regarding the inclusion of certain\nprovisions within the letter notifying an individual of a proposed transfer and requesting consent to\nthe transfer.  A copy of the DMR regulations concerning the transfer and the consent letter is mailed\nalong with the request for consent.  All individual rights are therefore spelled out clearly in the\ntransfer letter and attached regulations.  Plaintiffs' assertion that these rights are not conveyed\nadequately in the letter is therefore unfounded.\na. The 45-day letters include statements addressing how the proposed\nmove will result in improved services and supports and quality of life\nfor the individual, as required by 115 CMR § 6.63(2)(c)(1).\n  \nThe letters that Plaintiffs' representatives reviewed (see Report at 8) include a variety of\nlanguage that conveys that the proposed move will result in improved services and quality of life.\nFor example, statements such as:  “This new home will offer [Class Member] a smaller, more\ncommunity integrated setting while providing the staff supervision and supports needed  . . . and\nallow [Class Member] the opportunity to transition into community based day supports” are used\nin many of the letters the Department has issued.  These statements convey information to the\nindividual or the individual’s guardian that the proposed transfer will result in improved services\nand as such they meet the requirements of 115 CMR § 6.63. \nb. The 45-day letters were mailed to Class Members or guardians and\nreturn letters were signed by them signifying receipt and consent  to\nthe proposed transfer.\n     All of the letters that were mailed to interested persons and the signed consent forms were\nincluded among the materials that were reviewed by Class Counsel.  Letters are not typically sent\n-23-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 24 of 30\nby certified mail, and therefore proof of receipt is based upon (1) the presumption that a mailed\nletter will be delivered, and (2) a signed, returned consent form unequivocally establishing that the\nletter was received.  Plaintiffs' complaints about this, Report at 8, are purely specious.  \nc. Guardians consulted with Department staff  regarding the transfer of\ntheir wards and voluntarily consented to a proposed transfer.\nAll transfers of Fernald Class Members were made pursuant to signed consent forms from\nthe involved individual and/or the individual’s guardian(s).  The Department urges and actively\nencourages meaningful guardian participation in the placement planning activities of their wards\nregardless of whether the guardians are elderly, live out of state, or are corporate guardians.\nAlthough the Department encourages guardian participation, the particular level of participation is\nnot mandated.  Information concerning placement is provided to elderly, out-of-state, and corporate\nguardians in the same manner it is provided to other individual guardians.  It is then up to the\nindividual guardians to determine the appropriate level of involvement in planning for their ward.\nEvidence of their planning considerations would not necessarily be included among the information\nreviewed by Class Counsel.  Again, thus far every transfer has occurred with the consent of the\nClass Member and/or  his  or  her guardian(s).  Since the announced closure of the Fernald\nDevelopmental Center in February 2003, many families and guardians have discussed alternative\nplacement with the Department and have proceeded with planning for their wards.     \nAllegations that some of the transferees had out-of-state guardians or paid guardians (due\nto the lack of an available family guardian) are true.  A small number of the transferees have out-of-\nstate guardians, as do some of the individuals still residing at Fernald.  While it is optimal for\nindividuals to have nearby, involved family members serving as guardians, that is not always\npossible.  That some guardians are either paid guardians or out-of-state family members or friends\n-24-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 25 of 30\ndoes not obviate the voluntariness of the transfer.   \nd. The letters that were signed by the guardians and returned to the\nDepartment constitute ample evidence of the guardian’s voluntary\nconsent to the proposed transfer.\nThe Department's Notice of and Request for Consent to Proposed Facility Transfer letter\ncomplies with all applicable requirements for guardian consent to a ward's transfer to a new setting.\nThe consent form and letter is a written record that explains the transfer process and requests consent\nto the transfer in a detailed manner.   The letter specifically invites the guardian to contact the\nDepartment to discuss any questions or concerns regarding any aspect of the transfer and explains\nin detail the rights of the parties if the guardian chooses not to consent to the proposed transfer.  A\ncopy of the transfer regulations is mailed with the letter so that the guardian can refer to a complete\nstatement of the ward's rights.   \nIn an attempt to muddy the water, Plaintiffs cite DMR regulations requiring “informed\nconsent” that only apply prior to admission to a facility or prior to medical or other treatment that\nrequires an explication of the “risks and benefits” of admission or medical treatment.13  Notably,\nClass Member transfers are not listed among the limited situations in 115 CMR § 5.08 for which\ninformed consent must be secured, and it would not be appropriate to discuss the \"risks\" of\ncommunity placement in the way that the risks of a medical procedure must be discussed.  Plaintiff’s\ninsistence upon this inapplicable standard is yet another effort to malign the popular choice of\n13  The Fernald Plaintiffs erroneously contend that the voluntary transfer of an individual from a\nDepartment facility requires the “informed consent” of the individual or guardian.  “Informed\nconsent” is a term of art defined in the Department’s regulations, and is required only in limited\ninstances and is generally reserved for medical procedures, research activities, facility admissions\nor related activities.  See 115 CMR § 5.08.  Transfer from one setting to another requires consent,\nnot “informed consent” as defined in 115 CMR § 5.08; nevertheless, the 45-day letter and consent\nform the Department provides during the transfer process clearly meets this standard as well as the\nstandard set forth in 115 CMR § 2.01’s definition of \"consent.\" \n-25-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 26 of 30\ncommunity placement by inferring that such placements entail “risk.”     \ne. The 45-day letters Class Counsel reviewed in most  instances include\na statement that the parties may visit and examine the proposed home\nat a time and in a manner not disruptive to individuals who may be\nliving in the home, as required by 115 CMR § 6.63(2)(c)(3). \nAs all of the transfers from the Fernald Developmental Center have been voluntary transfers,\nin most instances visits by Class Members, families, or guardians to a proposed living environment\noccurred at the beginning of the placement process. For that reason, and in accordance with the\nregulatory requirements, many of the letters reviewed included statements such as:  “Please note that\nyou may visit [Class Member] at any time you would like at his new home.”  As these individuals\nmay have already visited the home, the inclusion of a statement informing them that they may view\nand inspect the proposed home would not be appropriate.  The statements that were included in the\nletters, although not an exact recitation of the regulatory requirements, convey the intention that the\nparties may visit a Class Member at any time in the new living environment and are in accordance\nwith the facts of the situations presented.      \nI. Class Counsel’s Allegations Regarding the Home and Community-Based\nWaiver Program Are Factually and Legally Incorrect.                                 \nPlaintiffs' statements about the home and community-based waiver program are both\nimmaterial and legally and factually incorrect.  First, as all Fernald transferees are Ricci class\nmembers for whom the Department has an obligation to meet their service needs, regardless of the\navailability of funding, the implication that receiving services through the home and community-\nbased waiver program is risky in terms of future funding is misleading and false.14  Second,\nplaintiffs' statements about the legal requirements of the home and community-based waiver\n14  Plaintiffs have made no argument that the Commonwealth is failing to adequately fund services\nfor Ricci class members, as required by the 1993 Final Order. \n-26-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 27 of 30\nprograms are inaccurate.  The home and community-based waiver program is a Medicaid program\nwith a myriad of rules and requirements, the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this\nResponse.   However, plaintiffs' contention that individuals can be eligible for services within a\nhome and community-based waiver program but not receive them due to inadequate resources is\ninaccurate.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1915(c).  Finally, the Department has made a presentation to\nthe Fernald League on the subject of the home and community-based waiver, at their request, and\nis always available to answer questions about it.  In sum, there is no requirement in the transfer\nstatute or regulations, or elsewhere in the DMR regulations, that individuals be informed of the\nHome and Community Based Waiver Program (“HCBW”) prior to their residential transfer, but such\ninformation, though not relevant to the delivery of services to Ricci class members, is available.\nJ. Following  An  Individual’s  Alternative  Placement  From  The  Fernald\nDevelopmental Center, The Class Member And The New Team Complete\nAn ISP Within 30 or 60 Days That Complies With All Applicable Federal,\nState, and Department Requirements.                                                            \n   \nClass Counsel’s allegation that DMR regulations are being routinely violated because ISPs\nare not completed within 30 days following transfer is incorrect and not based upon established fact,\nlaw, or regulations.  When an individual is moved to another ICF/MR, a new ISP must be developed\nwithin 30 days following the transfer.  See 42 CFR 483.440(a)(3).  For a move to the community,\na new ISP must be developed within 60 days following the transfer.  See 115 CMR 6.23.  In some\ninstances, ISP meeting dates are adjusted or postponed to accommodate unforeseen circumstances,\nincluding instances in which a necessary guardian or family member is unable to attend.  In all\ninstances, the Department seeks to ensure that these regulatory requirements are met.  \nK. The Number of Individuals Who Have Transferred From Fernald That Have\nSince Died Is Not Unexpected.                                                                      \n   A significant number of the individuals served by the Department have a multitude of serious\n-27-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 28 of 30\nhealth and medical issues that they live with every day.  The individuals who transferred from the\nFernald Developmental Center are no different in that respect.  The age span of individuals who\nhave transferred from Fernald and died following their placement elsewhere ranges from 41 to 92\nyears of age, with the average age being 57 years old.  The earliest death occurred just over two\nmonths following the transfer, with the latest occurring over a year and a half following the\nalternative placement.  As stated above, all of the individuals concerned had a multitude of serious,\nlong-standing health problems, and in most instances the individual’s death was related to these\nissues.  \nMortality reviews conducted by a physician, nursing staff, and other mortality review team\nmembers in each case have concluded that the deaths were all the result of natural causes -- i.e.,\nunderlying medical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia (the cause of death for two Class\nMembers), cardiac arrest (which also killed two Class Members), or acute myelogenous leukemia,\nin which death is not an unexpected outcome.15\nL. Familiar Staff Are Used To Help Transition Individuals.   \nThe Department has, where appropriate and possible, used staff familiar to the transferee to\nease the transition process.  Enochs Aff., ¶ 84.  While the Department considers services provided\nby familiar staff to be an important and beneficial objective for individuals receiving services from\nthe Department, it is not a specific requirement of the regulations governing provision of services,\n15  The mortality review documents were not included with the materials that were given to Class\nCounsel to review as they were not a part of the materials subject to the Protective Order signed by\nthe Court of June 15, 2005.  The Order that was drafted governed the disclosure of materials\nnecessary for Class Counsel to review and assess whether services provided to individual Class\nMembers satisfied the requirement they receive equal or better care.  These materials were largely\ncomprised of individual support plans and other materials directly associated with the individual’s\ntransfer.  Any notations of death were not a component of the documents that were provided to\ndemonstrate equal or better services and were additionally not covered by the provisions of the\nProtective Order.  As such, they were not included among the material reviewed by Class Counsel.\n-28-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 29 of 30\nnor is it a requirement that individual transfers are contingent upon.  As the populations of larger\nICFs/MR get smaller, it is hoped that staff from these facilities will continue to serve individuals\nas they transition to alternative locations.  While the involvement of familiar staff in the lives of all\nindividuals served is an aspiration for the provision of services, the Department recognizes that\nindividual staff members are free to pursue employment in environments of their own choosing and\nit cannot simply mandate that services be provided only by staff familiar to the transferee.    \nM. Fernald ISP Team Members Regularly Meet With and Communicate With\nISP Team Members In the New Living Environment.                                  \nDuring the transition of an individual from one living environment to another there is a\nsignificant amount of communication between staff at the present and proposed locations.  This\ncommunication is coordinated through the individual’s Individual Transition Team and evidence\nof this communication would not necessarily be included among the materials that were provided\nto Class Counsel for his review.  Through the use of the individual transition plan and visits to the\nnew living environment, the individual is prepared for the smoothest possible transition to their new\nresidence.  Staff at the individual’s former home are always available for consultation if there are\nadditional questions concerning a particular individual’s transition.   \nN. Contrary To Class Counsel’s Assertion That Services Have Been Reduced\nTo Accommodate Transfers, The Department Has Continued To Offer Care\nAnd Services At The Fernald Center That Comply With Title XIX Standards\nAnd The Requirements Of DMR Regulations.                                              \n Although service reductions were alleged at the Department’s meeting with Class Counsel\non January 18, 2006, no specific identifying information was provided regarding the individuals\nbeing referred to, so it was difficult for the Department to effectively respond to this allegation.  The\nDepartment is aware, however, that there have been very limited complaints regarding Class\nMembers not adjusting well to their new living environment.  When these issues have arisen, they\n-29-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86   Filed 02/08/06   Page 30 of 30\nare dealt with quickly and efficiently by Department and provider staff in cooperation with\nguardians and family members on an individualized basis.  \nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the reasons detailed herein and in the attached affidavit, this Court should\n(1) conclude that the Department continues to abide by its obligations under the 1993 Final\nOrder and governing law; (2) reject the \"recommendations\" recently issued by the Fernald Class\nCounsel; and (3) decline to take further action in this closed case.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDEPARTMENT OF MENTAL RETARDATION,\nBy its attorneys:\n_________________________________ \nMarianne Meacham, BBO No. 550468\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General\nGeneral Counsel\nDepartment of Mental Retardation\n500 Harrison Avenue\nBoston, MA  02118\n(617) 727-5608\n/s/ Robert L.

Okin, et al.,\nDefendants\n___________________________________\nSECOND AFFIDAVIT OF DIANE ENOCHS\nI, Diane Enochs, on oath hereby depose and state as follows:\n1. I have been employed by the Department of Mental Retardation (the “Department” or\n“DMR”) since 1986.  My position is Assistant Commissioner for Facility Management.  This is\nmy second affidavit to the court in this matter.  Unless otherwise indicated, the facts contained in\nthis Affidavit are based on personal knowledge, information provided by DMR staff who report\nto me, and/or DMR records.\n2. As Assistant Commissioner for Facility Management, it is my responsibility to ensure\ncompliance with regulations promulgated under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C\n§§ 1396, et seq. (found at 42 C.F.R. Part 430 to end), throughout the Department’s ICF/MR\nfacilities, and to ensure that licensure and certification of the state-operated programs is\nmaintained.\n3. As the Assistant Commissioner for Facility Management, I have primary responsibility\nfor the implementation of the Department's policy decision to close the Fernald Developmental\nCenter.  To support this work, I have established a leadership team comprised of senior staff,\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 2 of 24\nincluding individuals with many years of experience in maintaining Title XIX compliance,\nquality assurance, active treatment, individual service planning, building and capital issues, and\ncommunity programming, placement and systems.  These staff are directly involved in all\naspects of the closure process and report regularly to me on their activities.\nPlacements from Fernald\n4. I have read the “Report to the Court” filed by Attorney Beryl Cohen on February 2, 2006. \nI understand it was based upon a limited record review of 43 records, and without any contact\nwith the individual Ricci Class Members involved, their family members or guardian, or DMR\nstaff.\n5. The Department has a history of community placement for those with severe needs. \nBelchertown, Dever, and Berry all had fragile, medically needy individuals who moved to the\ncommunity.  These placements have been very successful and speak to the ability of the\nDepartment to ensure that placements are made with the utmost care.  \n6. Since the announced closure of Fernald by Governor Romney on February 26, 2003,\nfifty-five (55) people have moved from Fernald to another home.  Fourteen (14) individuals have\nchosen placement in the community and thirty-five (35) have chosen placement in an alternative\nICF/MR.  The remaining six (6) went to skilled nursing facilities.\n7. Of these 55 people, no Ricci Class Member or guardian has asked that the Class Member\nbe returned to Fernald. \n8. The transfer process that the Department followed for each of the 55 people who have\nbeen placed outside of Fernald will continue as we move forward.  The process, from the very\nfirst discussion concerning an individual’s placement, attempts to engage the guardian to the\nfullest extent possible.  Guardian involvement in the placement process to date has ranged from\n-2-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 3 of 24\nintricate involvement, with some even initiating the alternate placements, to nominal\ninvolvement, letting the ITP team direct the process.  The individual’s ISP team and guardians\nare asked to identify the needs of the individual, what residential model for the individual would\nbe best, a facility or a community home, what geographic area the guardian wants the individual\nto live in, etc.   Many times the moves have resulted in much shorter commutes for the guardian\nand increased visiting times.  Tours and visits of possible future homes for an individual are an\nextremely important part of the placement process.  Members of the individual’s ISP team and\nthe guardian are afforded the opportunity to see if a particular home or facility will meet the\nneeds of the individual; provided an opportunity to meet staff and individuals who may already\nlive in the home; or, in the case of new program development, given the chance to become\ninvolved in the creation of a new home.  New day program opportunities are also sought out and\ntoured.\n9. After a home is decided upon, an Individual Transition Plan is written.  This plan\nprovides very detailed information on the person’s preparation for moving, special information\nfor personal routines, social life, relationships and communication, physical considerations and\nequipment needs, safety considerations and health/medical/psychological issues.  The ISP is also\nreviewed carefully, which is also documented in this plan.  There is another section that covers\nonly transition issues.  This section includes information about the new support provider,\nimportant contact persons, the type of day supports, community medical providers, a schedule of\nvisits, an in-service training schedule, financial issues and, finally, follow-up support services.\nCertification of Equal or Better\n10. The Fernald Facility Director, Linda Montminy, must certify that each and every\nindividual who moves from Fernald will be receiving equal or better services in the new\n-3-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 4 of 24\nplacement.  In order to do this, Ms. Montminy reviews the objectives in the individual’s current\nISP and then reviews the objectives that were developed to be carried over through the transition\nto the next ISP.  The carryover objectives are set prior to the move.  This review not only ensures\nthat the objectives are similar but also includes the confirmation of who will be the objective\nmanager at the new placement.   Using this system, the Facility Director confirms and then\ncertifies that each individual will receive \"equal to or better\" services in the new facility.  Under\nmy supervision, this task has been completed for every individual who has transferred from\nFernald. \n11. There have been no requests from any guardian of an individual who has moved to a\ncommunity setting to return to an ICF/MR.  \n12. For those 14 individuals whose families have chosen community placement, the\ntransition processes have been thoughtful and caring.  Those individuals have adjusted well to\nnew settings, and are being provided an array of opportunities and experiences which would not\nhave been available to them at Fernald and have resulted in an improved quality of life.  \n13. For those 34 individuals reviewed by Plaintiffs whose families have chosen transfer to\nthe Templeton, Wrentham or Monson Developmental Centers, or to the Hogan or Glavin\nRegional Center, a full array of ICF/MR services supplied by knowledgeable and caring staff are\nequal to services provided at Fernald, and in most cases have resulted in improved opportunities\nfor community outings and more spacious living quarters for individuals.  \n14. Based upon my personal contact with these family members and guardians, I can state\nthat these factors have resulted in a high level of satisfaction expressed by individuals and their\nfamilies and guardians. \n15. Without minimizing in any way the potential for transfers to be disrupting, it is clear that\n-4-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 5 of 24\nmany of the individuals transferred and their families have expressed their views that the moves,\nwhile requiring adjustments, have been extremely positive for the class members and their\nfamilies.  One service coordinator for an individual (“A”) who moved to a community-based\nvendor-operated program in May of 2003 summarized A’s transition this way:\nid’s transition was extremely successful and without incident or issue.  He\nimmediately became oriented and comfortable in his new surroundings.  Behavioral,\npsychiatric, nursing support was all available to David as was ongoing support from\nstaff at Fernald in case David didn’t transition well into his new surroundings . . . .\nThe most important and obvious changes for David is the increase in community\nmembership:  David frequently goes for walks to the local store and makes purchases,\nhe has enjoyed day trips to New Hampshire and Maine, he is a member of the local\nYacht club, he has participated in countless community activities which have\nincluded picnics, concerts, dances hosting seasonal parties as well as some\ninvolvement with the local church.  David has also reached a point where he is able to\ncommunicate when he wants to spend time outside in the yard, which he does safely .\n. . .\n16. Several individuals have echoed the view that the new placement allowed them a new\nlifestyle that includes access to, and participation in, a variety of activities. \n17. For many individuals, the transition process itself proved uneventful.   The availability of\nfamiliar staff to assist with the transition has eased the adjustment period for other individuals.\n18. For some individuals in the community or at an ICF/MR, the moves have placed some\nindividuals in much closer proximity to families, allowing more time for visiting siblings and\nelderly parents. In particular for some aging parents with transportation challenges, this has\nproven very beneficial.  \n19. Most families and guardians have expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the new\nservices.  For example, A’s family member commented in A’s ISP in 2003:   \n“I find this I.S.P. report to be excellent and comprehensive.  I am very pleased with\nDavid’s  new home and workshop environment.  I am always available to help with\nDavid’s needs and plan on a continuing communication with the people that are\n-5-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 6 of 24\nassisting him in his growth.  It was a 'long one' but I was privileged to walk with my\nson to find his present destination.”  \nGuardian and Consumer Satisfaction Surveys\n20. The Department routinely sends a “Satisfaction Survey” to any guardian whose ward has\nmoved from Fernald at least one year previously.  Questions are posed in the form of statements\nregarding the level of satisfaction with planning for placement, the transition process, and post-\nplacement services and supports.  Responses are offered in the form of ratings from 1 to 5.  A\ncopy of the survey form is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n21. A rating of 1 indicates that the guardian strongly agrees with the statement, and a rating of\n5 indicates strong disagreement.  On all questions except one, a rating of 1 is the most favorable\nresponse and 5 is the least favorable.  \n22. On one question, the ratings do not evaluate services but seek information about guardian’s\npreferences before the move.  There are 17 questions on the survey that request the guardian’s\nrating on this scale of 1-5.  All questions offer the opportunity for comment.  \n23. To date, about half the eligible guardians have completed and returned the satisfaction\nsurveys, yielding 17 sets of responses in all.  Responses to all questions have been\noverwhelmingly favorable.  Of 272 possible ratings (of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) on as many survey items:\n• 211 or 78% were 1\n• 38 or 14% were 2\n• 5 or 2% were 3\n• 1 or less than 1% was 4\n• 3 or 1% were 5\n• 14 or 5% were not rated\n-6-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 7 of 24\nCollectively, 249 or 92% of the responses were favorable (1s or 2s), five or 2% were neutral,\nfour or 2% were unfavorable, and 14 or 5% were not given a rating.\n24. After receiving the Satisfaction Survey, one guardian telephoned the Department.  She was\nvery happy with the move and her ward’s response to it.  The reason for the call was her worry\nover news reports about the Plaintiffs going back to court.  She asked the staff person:  “Is the\nlawyer going to make me move my son back to Fernald?”\n25. Another example of an individual being very happy with the move occurred when a staff\nperson from Fernald went to visit an individual who had moved.  When the individual heard the\nvoice of the staff person, he left the couch he was sitting on and ran.  This staff person believed\nthis response was due to his fear he would have to go back to Fernald. \n26. Another example of guardians being happy with their ward’s move occurred with an\nindividual who moved from Fernald to another facility.  This individual was terminally ill when\nshe left Fernald but the guardians wanted their sister to be nearer to their homes.  This individual\nhas since passed away but the guardians told the Deputy Facility Director they believed that their\nward’s life was extended because of the wonderful care their sister received.  \nDeaths of Transferees\n27. There have been 6 deaths among those transferred over the last three years.  Given the\nage of the individuals and the serious underlying medical conditions which were identified in the\nmortality review process, the deaths were not unusual.   \nPlaintiffs' Complaints about ISP Objective \nModifications to Reflect New Conditions or Progress\n28. Individual support planning is an on-going process of establishing goals for individuals\nconsistent with the outcomes described in the quality of life areas set forth in the Department’s\n-7-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 8 of 24\nregulations, along with identifying supports and strategies that will promote achievement of\nthose goals.  The Department’s regulations establish the framework for individual support\nplanning, which can be tailored to and by the individual and which is responsive to changing\ncircumstances in the individual’s life.  \n29. All services and objectives are determined according to an individual’s need.  An ISP is a\n“fluid” document and may require changes and updates prior to the yearly ISP meeting.  In the\n“Report” written by Plaintiffs' counsel, Attorney Cohen states that objectives were no longer\nindividualized.  However, a person’s environment necessarily impacts what a person needs. \nChanges in an individual’s objectives are always based on that individual and what their needs\nare at that time.  If an objective is no longer necessary, it is modified to reflect what the\nindividual truly requires.  \n30. In the Plaintiffs' Report, the examples given of an “individualized objective” included\none stating “operating a musical toy” and “learning to flush the toilet.”  However, that individual\nis now in a home-like environment where operating a musical toy is too specific.  If this sensory\nobjective was in place for cause and effect training, this could be met by any number of things\nthat occur in the community.  A trip to a concert would result in hearing music play or helping to\ncook in the kitchen would result in a meal to be eaten.  \n31. Another factor that must be considered is that each individual has the ability to learn\nthrough objectives across settings.  That is, the learning involved in flushing the toilet and\noperating a musical toy can be facilitated through any number of strategies.  \n32. One of the examples employed by Plaintiffs indicates that 28 days after transfer,\nobjectives changed from “consistently flushing the toilet” and “brushing his teeth more\ncompletely” to more general objectives.  This individual was recognizable to us and we learned\n-8-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 9 of 24\nfrom the Area Office that this person was so successful in his new home that he no longer\nneeded prompts to either flush the toilet or brush his teeth.  These objectives were met and were\ntherefore no longer necessary.  The new objectives to “actively engage in offered activities” and\n“become familiar with and use his residence independently or with staff’s verbal prompts” were\nappropriate new objectives not found in the prior ISP.  \n33. The other examples of “reducing services” also reflect appropriate developmental\nchanges.  It would be inappropriate to retain objectives that have been achieved as part of the\nISP as objectives should not remain static when individuals progress.  \nPlaintiffs' “Case Stud[ies]”\n34. I reviewed the “Case Study” materials submitted with Plaintiffs'  Report.  These appeared\nto be extracts from the ISPs, with no information as to which ISP (before transfer or after\ntransfer) these sentences were quoted from or what the purpose of the inclusion of these excerpts\nare to the issue of the provision of “equal to or better” services.  Many of the individuals living\nat Fernald are medically fragile individuals.  However, these and all individuals who move from\nFernald are placed in a facility or home that can provide the necessary services.  Wrentham,\nMonson and Hogan Developmental Centers all have intensive medical supports for medically\nfragile individuals.  Community-based programs may also support medically fragile persons.\nImprovements at Fernald \n35. There have been many improvements to the physical plant as well as changes in the\nprograms attended by individuals served at Fernald.  Staffing changes have been made as well to\nmaximize supports on a consolidated campus for individuals who remain at Fernald as we move\ntowards closure.\n36. The Department launched a “Full Compliance” initiative in August of 2004.  It has been\n-9-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 10 of 24\nvery successful, resulting in a high level of compliance.  This initiative involves setting a\nminimal standard for all discipline and supervisory staff to formally monitor active treatment\nprograms, activity schedules, and the environment.  All monitoring information is submitted to\nthe Office of Quality Enhancement where compliance issues are identified and then followed up\nthrough resolution with management staff.  \n37. There are now two administrative divisions at Fernald rather than four.  Division\nDirectors John Hill and Suzanne Kingston each work with Assistant Division Directors to\noversee the delivery of active treatment to all residents.  The Division Directors report directly to\nthe Facility Director, Linda Montminy.\n38. Fernald has created two new Assistant Division Director positions along with adding 2.5\nMRW IV employees who assist the Division Directors with administrative and operational\nsupport.  \n39. The management team at Fernald now includes a new Deputy Facility Director and an\nExecutive Assistant for Core Services.\n40. Three new Ford F350 Wheelchair vans were obtained along two additional 12-passenger\nvans for use by the residential divisions.  Two new Ford F250 4x4 pickup trucks were also\npurchased for use by core services for plowing.  A new Ford 350 one-ton pickup truck with a\ndump body and plow was purchased in November and is in use now by the Farm and Grounds\nstaff.  This will be used to plow snow and disperse sand.  We also expect four new wheelchair\nvans to be delivered in February.  \n41. There is a new preventive maintenance system in place.  A condition report is made\nweekly to the Division Directors.  There is also a monthly preventive maintenance schedule,\nwhich provides a monthly quick check of each residential vehicle. \n-10-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 11 of 24\n42. There is a new Intensive Day Program on grounds at Brookside.  This day program\npromotes engagement to individuals with successful activities, an exposure to a variety of\nclasses each day, along with a new philosophy of having individual goals worked on.  This new\nprogram was a result of the team meeting to work on specific groupings of individuals and\nstaffing and specific activities for each room.  The individuals who attend Brookside have\nsessions in music, gardening, gross motor activities, obstacle course sessions, fine motor\nactivities, computer sessions, sensory exploration and daily living activities.  \n43. These same changes have begun and will continue to be made to the curriculums of the\nother day programs on grounds for the ongoing benefit of other individuals attending day\nprograms. \n44. There have been many improvements to the Fernald grounds, work-sites and residences\nin the past year.  They include:\n•     Greene Building\n- Renovated new thrift shop classroom and coffee shop with paint, new\nflooring and new shelving.\n- All exterior stairs/ramps had their concrete repaired and sealed against\nfuture deterioration of the concrete.\n- Repaired the retaining wall against future deterioration of the concrete.\n- Repaired and painted the Greene Building stairwells.\n- Replaced all screens for the outside Screen House.\n                     (cid:33)          Malone Park (ICFs)\n- Resurfaced sidewalks.\n-11-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 12 of 24\n- Replaced radiator covers at #21 and #22.\n- Installed sidewalk and safety rails at #24\n- Replaced entry canopy at #23\n- Replaced all of the sliding screen doors.\n- Remodeled kitchen at ICF 24.\n                     (cid:33)          Farrell Hall\n- Replaced screens\n- Replaced all glass at Farrell Hall front entrance\n- Repaired and sealed front stairs\n- Renovated four pantries\n- Renovated 2 tub rooms\n- Replaced all vanities in Apartment #2\n                     (cid:33)          Cottage Complex\n- Concrete repairs to Cottage 7 and Cottage 11 in their horseshoes\n- Renovated the laundry rooms in Cottage 11, including new washers and\ndryers\n- Renovated one laundry room in Cottage 9\n- Replaced tub room floor in Cottage 3B\n- Renovated bath and shower room in Cottage 3B\n                     (cid:33)          Marquardt/Thom Buildings\n- Installed new visitor’s parking lot\n- Installed new walkway to front door\n- Repainted nursing home area\n-12-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 13 of 24\n                     (cid:33)          Activity Center\n- Repaired water damage and repainted Activity Center\n- New Wiring                               \n• Site 7/FLOW Workshop \n      -     Installed electrical handicap access doors\n      -     Painted safety bollards in front entrance.\n• Woodside \n- Painted the entire inside of the building\n- Painted the safety bollards in front of the building\n• Brookside\n- Installed sidewalk & safety rails at front entrance\n- Renovated the entire inside of the building which included painting of\nentire building; electrical work; trailing rails on the interior; installed\nnew walkway and rails from the fire exit to the street; installed/repaired\nall doors and cabinets.\n- Installed new outdoor carpet at the front entrance and leveled cement\nbeneath.\n- Carpenters built adaptive equipment to assist in the sensory room. \nTitle XIX Survey Results at Fernald\n45. Fernald underwent a very successful annual Department of Public Health survey in\nMarch of 2005.  The Department of Public Health gave the facility a very favorable report with\nno active treatment citations and a finding of all conditions of participation being met.  \n-13-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 14 of 24\n46. The Department of Public Health has recently finished its annual survey at the Hogan\nRegional Center in Danvers and the Wrentham Developmental Center in Wrentham, both Title\nXIX facilities of the Department of Mental Retardation.  Both facility directors were told during\nthe exit interview that there were no failures to meet required conditions and no deficiencies in\nthe provision of care.\n47. The current ratio of staff to individuals here at Fernald is 3.6 to 1.  At the time of the\nannouncement of the closure of Fernald in 2003 the ratio of staff to individuals was 2.8 to 1.\nIssues with the Current Placement Planning Process\n48. As a result of the Court’s order of January 20, 2005, the Department has bifurcated the\nplacement planning process from the Individual Support Planning (“ISP”) process into two\nsteps:  (1) discussion of all of the elements of the individual’s service plan, but excluding any\ndiscussion of placement in a less restrictive setting; and (2) a separate meeting to discuss\nplacement planning.  The Department has also notified class counsel of the dates of all ISPs for\nFernald residents and of the dates of placement planning meetings for those individuals\nrepresented by class counsel.  Representation by class counsel was indicated by the guardian’s\nexecution of a release allowing the Fernald League to participate in the ISP meeting.  The\nDepartment has scrupulously complied with these requirements, refraining from any discussion\nof placement at the ISP meeting, and notifying class counsel of all ISP dates and placement\nplanning meetings dates, even though class counsel has not chosen to appear at any such\nmeetings.\n49. This bifurcation has resulted in the unintended consequence of families/guardians\nparticipating in most areas of their ward’s life but not in planning for his/her future home.  \n50. The bifurcated process now in place does not allow the Department to be responsive to\n-14-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 15 of 24\nthe change each individual will necessarily go through when dealing with the placement\nplanning process.  \n51. An example of the problem of bifurcation can be seen in the case of an individual’s\nguardian who attended an ISP meeting for the year 2006.  The placement planning meeting had\nbeen held in 2005 after the finalization of the 2005 ISP.  This guardian did not attend the\nplacement planning meeting.  At this ISP meeting, the guardian said that though the team had\nrecommended community placement for his ward, he thought a facility would be the best place\nfor him to go.  The guardian was advised that the Department could not discuss placement issues\nduring the ISP meeting and therefore another meeting for placement would have to be scheduled. \nThough this meeting was the ideal place for the Department and the family to discuss future\nplanning for the individual, we could not do so.   \n52. The inability to discuss placement planning along with the ISP impacts the team’s ability\nto discuss change with the guardians and to offer their support in the decision making process.\n53. The ISP meeting is the natural place to discuss issues pertaining to the individual, like\nmoving and the related considerations, decision making, planning and preparation.\n54. Although we continue to strongly encourage family/guardian participation in placement\nplanning meetings, placement is not being discussed with the families since the majority of the\nfamilies are choosing not to attend placement planning meetings.     \n55. Though the majority of families who have not participated in placement planning have\nstated that they do not desire placement for their family member outside of Fernald, even though\nthey have been assured that Fernald is closing and have seen evidence of this through facility\nconsolidations, placements, staff re-deployment, and direct and clear statements from the\nDepartment that Fernald is closing, follow up letters and or telephone calls are made to inform\n-15-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 16 of 24\nfamilies of all placement activities undertaken on behalf of their family member.  It is the\nDepartment’s obligation to keep guardians informed of all placement planning activity, even\nwhen guardians express the sentiment that they do not desire any contact or communication\nconcerning placement.  In all of the Department’s communications to families concerning\nplacement planning, family participation is strongly encouraged.  \n56. An additional consideration is that for many families and guardians, making\narrangements to attend a second meeting to plan placement following the completion of the ISP\ncan be difficult.  Many family members are aged and traveling to the facility for another meeting\nis not always convenient.  Others work during business hours and taking another day from their\nschedules may not be possible.\n57. The guardians’ responsibility to make informed decisions based on all available\ninformation on behalf of their wards is thus not being met when families refuse to participate in\nany discussion pertaining to the closing of Fernald.\nIncreased Number of Appeals\n58. A further consequence of the bifurcation of the ISP is that families are being advised by\nclass counsel and the Fernald League that in order to delay placement planning, the ISP should\nbe appealed so it will not be “finalized.”\n59. These appeals then proceed to Informal Conference with the guardians themselves\nunaware of the issues.  At a recent Informal Conference, the guardian, reading from a letter she\nsigned, could not explain what one of the issues were because she said she did not write it. \n60. The large number of appeals being handled by the Fernald League, in some cases without\nthe guardian, has resulted in scheduling issues, cancellation of informal conferences and fair\nhearings.  \n-16-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 17 of 24\n61. The Department’s practice has been to allow reasonable extensions of time for good\ncause.  \n62. One recent hearing lasted four full days due to the necessity of going through all nine\ngrounds of appeal without one real regulatory issue being identified beforehand.\n63. In the past two years, there has been a significant increase in the number of ISP appeals\nat Fernald.  \n64. Prior to the announced closure, there was one ISP appeal in 2001 and zero ISP appeals\nfor the year 2002.  In 2003, there were three ISP appeals, 15 appeals in 2004, and 46 appeals in\n2005. \n65. The majority of the ISP Appeal Notification forms that are used to file an appeal indicate\nthe reason for appeal as “1-9” – meaning that all of the ISP-related options on the form are\nselected,  even though some of these options clearly do not apply.  Eligibility for DMR services,\none of the nine options, has never been in question for these Ricci Class Members (who enjoy\nspecial eligibility for services pursuant to court order and DMR regulations).\n66. Some examples of reasons for appeal given at Informal Conferences include requests for\nthe following additions to the ISP:  \n•  “a safe campus-style environment with limited traffic”  This is a standard\nrequest from the League, regardless of whether or not an individual walks\nindependently around campus, or is totally dependent on staff to push his/her\nwheelchair.\n• “a barrier free environment on the first floor”   This request has been made\nfor those who currently live on the second floor.\n• “Staff do 30-minute bed checks”  This is also routinely being requested as an\naddition to “Current Supports.”  The bed checks are a Fernald procedure and\nstaff expectation.  The ISP should reflect the needs of the individual, and should\ndocument the actual supports needed at night, such as re-positioning, assistance\n-17-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 18 of 24\nto the bathroom, changes, etc. \n• “on grounds”  This is being requested as a description for every clinic/health\ncare appointment that is held at Fernald or Tufts Dental Clinic.  For some\nindividuals this is need based, and a real support.  It might be a strong\npreference, or important for health based or behaviorally based reasons.  For\nothers, it is not relevant or even a real support; their appointments could be held\nelsewhere. \n• The ISP template introduces the “Individual Vision” section as follows: \nVision for the future of the individual that focuses on increasing the\nopportunities for the individual to have more positive experiences which\nare linked with the preferences of the individual and with opportunities\navailable in the community.”   Informal Conferences are being used to attempt\nto start a debate about the appropriateness of these words.  Demands are made\nto have them removed, with the justification that they represent a political\nagenda, connected to the closure of Fernald.\n• Complete description of nursing shift coverage and where the nurses are\nlocated (i.e., in-building _x_hours per day).  Again this is a routine request\nfor everyone who has League representation, rather than a particularized\ninclusion of an individual’s medical/nursing support needs.  On a number of\noccasions, we have been asked to insert a statement that a person “requires” the\nnumber of hours of nursing care that correspond to the hours that a nurse is\npresent in a building, without regard for the person’s specific needs.\n• Requests for statements to be included in the “Individual Vision” section\nhave included:  \n(A) “To have ISP team, guardians’ and family assistance to protect due\nprocess rights with respect to state and federal regulations and Ricci class\nentitlement.” \n(B) “To receive a lifetime of services from the state of Massachusetts\nunder the consent decree.”\n• “Current Supports”  In one case, the ISP contained a statement that a person\n\"has the support of a psychologist….\"  The Department was requested to\nchange the language to \"'close' support.\"\n• Another recent appeal involved a request for two additional items in the ISP. \nThe guardian did not participate in the Informal Conference.  The two items\nwere (1) the addition of the words “on grounds” for clinics, and (2) the addition\nof the line “a pharmacist conducts quarterly medication reviews.”  A pharmacist\nconducting medication reviews is a routine practice as opposed to being a\nunique need of this individual.  This appeal resulted in nothing more than eight\n-18-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 19 of 24\nwords being added to the original ISP.  \n• “Licensed Nurses, Licensed Pharmacists, Licensed Therapists”   The\nLeague representatives are insisting that all clinicians be identified with the\nword “licensed.”  The fact that nurses and pharmacists have licenses in order to\nperform their duties is not something that belongs in an individual’s ISP.   \n• In one recent Informal Conference, one of the issues was replacing the word\n\"soda\" with \"decaffeinated coke and/or coffee.\"\n• Another ISP was appealed because the name of the individual was missing an\nupper case letter.\n67. Having the families and guardians together at the ISP with the entire ISP team present\nwould better meet the mandates of the Department's regulations and Title XIX regarding\nguardian involvement in the major life events of individuals.  \n68. It is imperative that individuals with mental retardation served by the Department are\nalways offered the least restrictive alternatives available and appropriate in all aspects of their\nlife.  These discussions would typically occur at the ISP meeting.  However, what was meant as\na helpful strategy (bifurcation) is resulting in minimal or total lack of any discussion with\nguardians of the future of the individuals residing at Fernald. \n69. Several families have told Department staff that they really liked the ISP but that the\nLeague wanted them to appeal.  \n70. Families have attended Informal Hearings and demonstrated no understanding at all of\nwhat they were there to do.  Often, the family says nothing and the League does all of the\ntalking.  One elderly parent and guardian recently asked “what is an ISP?” at the Informal\nConference for her son, sat patiently while the League representative presented her concerns,\nthen asked her, “Are you finished?”\n71. The Fernald League has effectively put a damper on the communication process and\n-19-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 20 of 24\ninterdisciplinary approach the ISP is supposed to encourage.  If a clinician presents an option to\nconsider that is not mentioned in the final ISP, the League, through the guardian, will then\nappeal the ISP, stating that the team made a decision which is not in the ISP.  Clinicians are\nreluctant to discuss ideas with other team members at the ISP meeting as a result since they are\nafraid to be held to providing services that may not be appropriate.\n72. The Fernald League is interfering with the ISP process.  What should be a gathering of\nclinicians and others who know the individual well discussing the individual’s needs and\nservices has become a discussion of rote language such as the insertion of “J lives in a campus\nenvironment with limited traffic.”  A Fernald League representative has demanded that this\nsentence be added at the ISP meetings of Class Members who are wholly dependent on others\nfor mobility and do not venture outside on their own.  \n73. League members have indicated during Informal Hearings that they have a complaint\nabout “staff conduct” when in fact the complaint is that each and every word they said at the ISP\nmeeting was not agreed to by the staff person being accused of conduct issues.\n74. Because of an increase in the length of ISP meetings, the focus on general language and\nnot the individual, and the difficulty clinicians have sometimes encountered when presenting\nvalid clinical opinions that do not produce the outcomes desired by the League (for example,\nPhysical Therapy staff stating that the pool will not help the person therapeutically), managers\nhave been attending these meetings in an attempt to keep the meeting focused on the individual\nand not on the administrative issues the League is continually bringing up at an individual’s ISP\nmeeting.\n75. Recently, a representative from the Fernald League chastised a Department employee (a\nQMRP) for giving a competent individual residing at Fernald a copy of his own ISP and for\n-20-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 21 of 24\nreviewing it with him.  This is a regulatory requirement and it is each individual’s right to accept\nor reject the ISP and the exercise of this right requires an understanding of its contents. \nSubsequently, the League, without any evidence of having obtained the individual’s assent,\nsubmitted an appeal of this ISP.  The League also filed an appeal of another ISP without any\nshowing of having obtained the guardian’s assent to the appeal.\n76. As described below, most families and guardians of individuals still living at Fernald\nhave been advised to refuse all communication with the Individual Transition Planning (“ITP”)\nteam, despite numerous efforts to engage them.  They have expressed an unwillingness to listen\nto the options available to their wards or to participate in any activities designed to provide\ninformation to them.  This has posed a significant problem for DMR staff attempting to ensure\nthat the families’ interests are considered in placement planning and that their concerns and fears\nare answered, ameliorated, or at least addressed.\n77. Letters from guardians to the supervisors of the ITP team indicating their refusal to\nparticipate in the placement planning process often contain very similar wording, reflecting the\nfact that this is wording they have been advised to use.\n78. Placement planning has been effectively slowed by the number of appeals that are being\nfiled in order to prevent individuals’ ISPs from being finalized.  \n79. In some cases, Fernald League representatives attend ISP meetings without the guardian\nbut with a written authorization.  \n80. In others, the League representative does all of the talking without any input from the\nguardian.    \n81. Extreme pressure is exerted by the Fernald League to have every word in a current ISP\nmatch the language of the prior year’s ISP.  This does not take into account that ISPs are fluid\n-21-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 22 of 24\ndocuments which must change along with the individual.  ISPs are not meant to be the same as\nthe previous year.  \n82. Additionally, presumably upon advice of counsel, some families for the first time\ndemanded that the ISP reflect a greater level of need than actually exists in an attempt to paint\nFernald as the only suitable setting for services.  One such demand is that the ISP state that the\nindividual has or has access to 24-hour nursing services even if the individual has no significant\nhealth issues and no need for this high level of nursing intervention.  In addition, some services\navailable at Fernald are available solely by virtue of Title XIX requirements for an ICF/MR and\nare not appropriate for inclusion in the ISPs of individuals who do not need them.\n83. Every individual who has moved outside of Fernald and every individual who presently\nremains at Fernald is a class member and is entitled to receive services and supports necessary to\nmeet their needs regardless of where they reside now and in the future.  The Department\nacknowledges the rights of class members and will provide services as identified in their\nIndividual Support Plans for the Class Members' lifetime in accordance with the 1993 federal\ncourt order.  The Department’s expectation and policy is that the ISP is the document that\nidentifies supports and services for an individual.  This document is a reflection of the\nindividual’s current abilities, support needs, objectives, and vision for the future.  This document\nby design and intent cannot remain stagnant and unchanged from year to year.   The ISP\ndocument certainly takes into account an individual’s history and the importance of continuity. \nHowever, in actuality, it is a plan for the future of an individual; one that reflects growth, life\nchanges, and new goals and visions. \n84. Transition planning involves both Fernald staff and the staff from the new placement. \nTransition visits occur for as long as necessary to make the individual comfortable.  After the\n-22-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 23 of 24\nmove to the new home, Fernald staff are available at all times to ensure the individual acclimates\nto his or her new home.  Familiar staffing is a concern for many families.  Families have\nexpressed fear that when their family member moves outside of Fernald familiar staff will not be\navailable to assist their family member.  When an individual moves, naturally the expectation is\nthat staff in the receiving home or facility will become the primary familiar staff as quickly as\npossible.  The transition needs of each individual are considered and planned individually, and\nwhen consultation and support has been needed from Fernald staff to assist with any difficulties\nan individual might experience, this has been provided.  Mostly, this has been in the form of\nconsultation.  The majority of individuals who have moved from Fernald have had excellent\ntransitions and they and their guardians have developed good relationships with the new staff.     \n-23-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 86-2   Filed 02/08/06   Page 24 of 24\nSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury this 7th day of February, 2006.\n/s/ Diane Enochs\n_______________________________\nDiane Enochs\nAssistant Commissioner for Facilities\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts \nDepartment of Mental Retardation",

In favor of this Motion, Plaintiff states as follows:\n1. After years of improved performance of its obligations under this Court’s oversight\nand the May 25, 1993 Disengagement Order, Department of Mental Retardation (“DMR”)\nefforts have fallen short in recent years, and consitute a violation of the Disengagement Order.\n2. For 2 years, the Wrentham Class made specific requests to DMR for information\nand policy changes to address the many shortcomings.   Specific shortcomings include:\na. Class members being subjected to substandard care, medical errors and\nabuse in community-based homes;\nb. Personnel who are not adequately trained or experienced;\nc. Insufficient monitoring of Class members, including failing to conduct\nperiodic review; and\nd. Failure to certify “equal or better” treatment at new locations for\ntransferred individuals.\n3. Furthermore, due to Governor Romney’s announced policy to close large\nintermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (“ICFMRs”) threatens Class members with\nworsening conditions and continually decreasing resources and services.  Simply put, the policy\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 84   Filed 02/07/06   Page 2 of 3\nwill decrease the number of available space for Class members at a time when more of them will\nneed the type of care available at the ICFMRs.  Closing the facilities will also serve to crowd the\ncommunity based programs which are already woefully inadequate to serve the needs of Class\nmembers.  As such, closing ICFMRs will necessarily violate this Court’s Disengagement Order.\n4. In further support, the Wrentham Class relies upon the Supporting Memorandum\nsubmitted herewith.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, the Wrentham Association, on behalf of all Wrentham Class\nMembers, respectfully request that his Court re-open this matter and return it to the active docket\nso that the Class members may benefit from this Court’s oversight.\nWRENTHAM CLASS MEMBERS,\nBy their attorneys,\n  /s/ Margaret M.

Actions  B~ the  Commonwealth  Which  Led  to  This  Action \nIn three budgetary acts from 2004-2007,  the Massachusetts \nlegislature directed  DMR  to  take  appropriate  steps  to  consolidate \nor  close  its  six  Intermediate  Care  Facilities  for  the  Mentally \nRetarded  (\"ICFs\"),  including  Fernald.  Several  reasons  were \narticulated.  The  legislation  stated one  purpose  of  the  directive \nwas  to  promote  compliance  with  a  Supreme  Court  decision,  Olmstead \nv.  I..C.  ex  reI.  Zimring,  527  U.S.  581  (1999).  That  decision,  in \n-6-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 267   Filed 10/02/08   Page 7 of 14\nturn,  emphasi  the  congressional  intent  in  Ti  II  of  the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  of  1991  (n ADA\" )  to  avoid \ndiscrimina::ion agains:: me,ltally  abled persons by promoting their \nplacement  into  community  settings.  Another  stated purpose  was  cO \nfurcher  the  Commonwealth's  own  established policy  reducing  it.s \nins::i tutional  capacity  and  of  providing  services  to  patients  in \nless  restrict  settings+  This  pelicy  decision  was  gret:nded  :n \nevidence  of  successful  transitions  of  a  number  of  mentally \nretarded residents  from  resident  settings,  from  past closing \nof  other  Furcher,  the Commonwealth was  cognizan:: of national \n~CFs. \ntrends  toward  deinstitucionali  and  the need  for  certainty in \nplanning  matters  such  as  personnel  placemen::.  legislature \nrequired DMR  to reduce  capacity ac  these  rCFs,  provided  that equal \nor  better  s  ces  for  residents  could  be  furnished  in  communi ty \nsettings. \nAnother consideration for the Commonwealth was  how to use \nits available resources  for  the care of the mentally retarded. \n::l~R \nhad  re:::;ei ved  estimates  in  2 DOl  for  the  ameum:  of  capital \nexpenditures  needed  to  maintain  rCF.  As  of  2001,  Fernald \nneeded  $14.3  Ilion  in  expenditures  to  repair  its \ninfrastruc::ure  and  $41.2  million  to  achieve  full  LUHlIC'J.iance  wi th \nthe  ADA.  Fernald  facil  was  ranked  among  the \nCommonweal::h's  :CFs  in  needed  capital  costs.  Indeed,  the  average \ndaily cost  of  ces  at  Fernald  as  of  FY  2007  was  over  $700  per \n-7 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 267   Filed 10/02/08   Page 8 of 14\non  a  day,  oc:  $259, 000  per  pec:son  annually.'  By  contrast \ncosts  at  the  other  reFs  ranged  from  $'33  to  $590  per  day.  The \nresident  cos~ was  also more  ~han 2.5  times  ~he \n:n \nper-person cost of residential community-based \n, \n2007,  these were  at  $280  per day  or $102,103  annually per \nday  programs  and  transportation  services. \nAs  of May  2007,  there  were  186  Fernald  residents  living \na  li~y  that  once  housed  nearly  2,000  individuals. \nresidents  included  131  in  ~he profound  range  of \n_ion,  40  in  the  severe  range,  12  in ~he moderate  \"''''\"'''''',  and \n3  -che  mild  range.  Fernald Center  residen~s  ranged \n36  to  95  years  old,  with  an  average  age  of  57.  Some  38  Ferna \nCenter  residents  were  aged  63  or  older. \nIn  2003,  as  said,  the  COR\"onwea:~h  announced  i~s \nintention  to  close  Fernald  by  transferring  its  residents  to \nor  care  in  its  other  five  rCFs  or  into  community \ns  including group homes.  The Commonweal th planned to keep \n4 \nopen  at  -che  Fernald  campus  a  24-person  residential  unit  and  a \ns  nursing  cencer  which  can  serve  29  individuals.

The  History  of  the  Ricci  Class  Action \nIn  1972,  residents  of  the  Belchertown  State  School,  a \nstate  institution  for  the mentally  retarded,  filed  a  class  action \nagainst  state  officials  alleging  that  conditions  there  violated \ntheir  constitutional  and  statutory  rights.  See  Ricci  I,  537  F. \nSupp.  at  819;  see  also  Ricci  III,  823  F.  Supp.  at  985-86.  A  class \naction  challenge  to  conditions  at  Fernald  was  filed  on  July  23, \n1974.  Complaint,  McEvoy  v.  Goldmark,  No.  C.A.  74-2768-T  (D.  Mass. \nJuly  23,  1974).  Suits  were  also  filed  on  behalf  of  residents  of \nother  state  institutions.  Ricci  I,  537  F.  Supp.  at  819.  The \n~ \nactions  were  consolidated before  Judge  Tauro  of  the  u.S.  District \nCourt  for  the  District  of  Massachusetts. \nAfter the suits were  filed,  the court took day-long views \nof  conditions  at  the  facilities.  Ricci  L  537  F.  Supp.  at  820. \nThe  court  determined  that  the  Commonwealth  was  not  providing  the \nconstitutionally required minimum  level of  care.  The  Commonwealth \ndefendants  chose  not  to  dispute  this  and  instead  \"agreed  to  work \n-9-\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 267   Filed 10/02/08   Page 10 of 14\nwith the plaint  ffs  and the cou=~ to fashion  comprehens~ve remedial \nprograms  ~ha~  would  be  :nemorialized  in  the  form  consent \nde crees.

On  October  9,  1986, \n(1s~ \ncourt  entered  an  orde=  which  set OJt  a  list of  specific tasks  for \nthe  Commonwealth  to  accomplish  and  =epresented  a  \"step  of \ndisengagement\"  for  ~he  court.  T:\"1e  order  contemplated \ncourt's  final  disengagement  after  three  years,  a  term  that  the \nparties  extended by  agreement.  at  764-65. \nclass  action  effectively  ended  in  1993  when  the \npa=ties  entered  into  a  final  consent  dec=ee,  which  the  district \ncourt  adopted  in a  final  Disengagement  Order. \nc. \nThe  DisenaagemenT  Ordpr \nOn  May  25,  1993,  district  com:::  signed  an  order \na: \n\"closing  federal  cou=t' s  oven;ight  the [l  [consolidated] \ncases.\"  Ricci  III,  823  F.

To  the  contrary,  the \na~d \nmonitor  found  tha::  DMR  had  complied  with  its  obligations  in  that \nperiod. \nThe  distr!ct  court  nevertheless  concluded  that  the \nConunonweal::h's  operation of the  IS? process  against  the  backgroJnd \nof  its  policy  decisior:  to  close  ?ernald  constituted  a  systemic \nfailure.

Given  that  the  monitor  found  and  the  court \naccepted  that  the  transfer  of  49  patients  after  the  2003 \nar:nour:cement  fully complied with the Disengagement Order,  cannot \nfollow that the  fact of the announcement  caused a  systemic failure. \n-22 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 267-2   Filed 10/02/08   Page 9 of 18\nIndeed,  the  2003  announcement  was  not  ~he fi~st bu~ one  of  several \nannouncements  made  of  a  closing  o~ phase-down  of a  D~R institution \nover  a  IS-year  period.

Whether  There  Was  Authority  Under  the  Modification \nDoctrine \nIn  reopening  the  consent  decree,  the  district  court  did \nnot  re_y  on  the  doctrine  that  in  limited  circumstances,  consent \ndecrees  in  institutional  reform  cases  may  be  modified.  n  fact, \nthis theory was  not  advanced before the district court.  Several of \nthe  briefs  advance  this  modification  rationale  as  an  alternative \nrationale whid:  they  argue  would  support  the  court's  reopening  of \nthe  decree.  Given  significance  of  is  case,  we  address  the \nquestion.  We  hold that  the plaintiffs have  not met  and  cannot meet \ntheir  burden  to  establish  that modification  is  warranted  and  that \nthe  court  thus  lacked  jurisdiction to  modify  the  consent  decree. \nIn  E!.llQ  v.  :inmatE''''  of  Suffolk  County  Jail,  502  U.S.  367 \n(1992) ,  Supreme  Court  set  forth  the  standards  that  apply when \n\"a  party  seeks  modification  of  a  term  of  a  consent  decree  that \narguably  ates  to  the  vindication  a  constitutional  right.\" \nat  383  n.7.

Under its terms, the necessary level of staffing \nat the various state institutions is to be determined by agreement of the parties. Any \nimpasse between the parties is to be brought to the court's attention for resolution.[2] \nOn July 22, 1981, defendants informed the court that, despite opposition from the plaintiffs, \nthey intended to implement significant staffing reductions at each of the institutions.[3] \nNotwithstanding the clear language of paragraph 10 of the Personnel Decree, the \ndefendants' original position was that they could implement staffing cuts over plaintiffs' \nobjections and without court approval. After the issue was briefed and argued, the \ndefendants conceded in open court that disputes between the parties concerning personnel \nare to be resolved by the court. \nThat concession brings into focus defendants' contention that a 408 person staff cut can be \nimplemented without affecting consent decree compliance. The plaintiffs disagree. And so, \nas both parties now acknowledge, this court must determine what level of staffing is \nnecessary to meet the requirements of the various controlling consent decrees. \nTo that end, the court held evidentiary hearings through the fall of 1981 and early part of \n1982. The case was taken under advisement on March 12, 1982, following the filing of final \nmemoranda by the parties. \nI \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn order to appreciate better the context and import of the issues involved, it is helpful to \nexamine briefly the history of this litigation. A class action was filed in 1972 on behalf of the \nmentally retarded clients of the Belchertown State School. The basis of the action was \nplaintiffs' assertion that conditions at the school were so inadequate that they violated the \nresidents' constitutional and statutory rights.[4] During the next three years, similar actions \nwere filed on behalf of the clients at Fernald, Monson, Wrentham, and Dever. Named as \ndefendants were various Commonwealth officials with direct and indirect responsibility for \nthe operation of these institutions.[5] \n\n820*820 Shortly after the institution of the Belchertown suit, this court took a day-long view \nof conditions there. Similar views were taken of the other institutions. Involved state and \nfederal officials accompanied the court on these views. Many legislators, including the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives and the then chairman of the Senate Ways and \nMeans Committee, accompanied the court on one or more views. \nThese views established beyond dispute that \"a constitutional level of care [had] not been \nattained\"[6] at these institutions and that conditions there were intolerable. Rather than \ndefend the indefensible, the state defendants agreed to work with the plaintiffs and the court \nto fashion comprehensive remedial programs that would be memorialized in the form of \nconsent decrees. \nDuring the next several months, the individuals concerned devoted hundreds of hours of \nstudy, negotiation, and planning to crafting five interim consent decrees which \"embod[ied] \nthe parties' collective assessment of the needs of the clients at the five state schools and \nthe appropriate means of meeting those needs.\"[7] The decrees were signed by various \nstate officials, including then Governor Michael Dukakis[8] and Attorney General Francis X. \nBellotti, at a hearing on July 25, 1977. \nAlong with the Governor and the Attorney General, the July 25, 1977 open court hearing \nwas attended by Speaker McGee of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. The \nSpeaker's presence prompted the following remarks by this court: \nMr. Speaker, you took the time to see the problem [of the state institutions for the retarded] \nfor yourself. You took the time out of a very, very busy schedule; and after doing so, you \ntold me that the legislature would provide the funds necessary to properly care for our \nretarded citizens. Your exact words to me were, \"If we can't take care of these people, we \nought to fold up our tents and go home.\" You are a man of your word, and I commend \nyou.[9] \nSpeaker McGee responded to the court's invitation to speak by stating, \nI just really want to say that in my 15 years in the legislature, a commitment has always \nbeen there by the members of the legislature. If one just goes to any one of these \ninstitutions and looks at the children there, then I just think — as I just said to you — \"If we \ncan't take care of them, then we had better fold up our tents and go home.\" \nAnd we are not ready to do to that. We are committed to the job that you want done; the \npeople involved want done, and we'll do it.[10] \nSpeaker McGee's remarks left no room to doubt that the legislature of the Commonwealth, \nlike the executive branch, was committed to providing care and treatment of the retarded in \nkeeping with the mandate of the consent decrees and the laws and Constitution of the \nUnited States. The remarks of Attorney General Bellotti that day are telling in this regard. \nHe said, \n\nI made a policy decision with the Governor during the pendency of these cases to, shall we \nsay, ameliorate the adversary system because we made a judgment that the level of care \ndid not reach [a] constitutional level of care.... \n821*821 We cannot tell people what kind of care there should be, but we can say that a \nconstitutional level of care has not been attained and that the case would be indefensible. \nWe made that judgment. I merely made a policy decision. They [the parents of the retarded] \ndid all the work with people from the State agencies, the Speaker, President of the \nSenate.[11] \nNo reasonable person could conclude that the fashioning and execution of these consent \ndecrees were the result of collusion between plaintiffs and defendants, nor that the \nlegislature's commitment to funding the decrees, as expounded by Speaker McGee, was \nanything but deliberate and substantive. Indeed, that fact is underscored by Attorney \nGeneral Bellotti's final remarks at the July 25, 1977 hearing. \nI think it is probably the classic example of where the good of the people overrides the \nadversary system: the cooperative effort among the Legislature, the Executive Branch, and \nthe Judicial Branches of Government — and they were talking so much about separation of \npowers because I think of your [the court's] ability more than anything else to reach that fine \nline where there is still a separation, yet a cooperation — that we are able to have \naccomplished all these things.[12] \nAlthough the consent decrees signed on July 25, 1977 contained provisions relating to \npersonnel, a final decree outlining the personnel requirements for the five state institutions \nwas not approved by this court until August 2, 1978. During the intervening year the parties \nconducted prolonged negotiations and attended innumerable meetings in an effort to \nhammer out the contours of a constitutionally and statutorily acceptable level of staffing.[13] \nThe final version of the decree was the culmination of a thorough, complex, and cooperative \nprocess. That process including input from a variety of sources, including the \nsuperintendents of the various institutions, as well as guidance of professionals from the \nMassachusetts Departments of Mental Health and Public Health. \nThe result of this objective, bipartisan inquiry was an agreement among the parties that it \nwas necessary to add a total of 2047 positions to the staffs of the five state schools. That \nagreement was formalized and implemented by the Personnel Decree signed on July 10, \n1978. \nThereafter, the various consent decrees affecting these five institutions continued to receive \nactual and articulated support from leaders in both the executive and legislative branches. \nFor example, at a September 1980 open court hearing concerning the status of the \ndecrees, Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairman Atkins stated that \"the legislature \nhas always, without exception and without delay, responded to all claims made by this court \nfor finances to put the state into compliance with the consent decrees.\"[14] Senator Atkins' \ncounterpart in the House of Representatives, Ways and Means Committee Chairman \nFinnegan, was even more positive in his statement of support, declaring that \"none of the \nintent of the consent decrees have ever been deviated from and they're not going to be.\"[15] \n\nThe staffing levels delineated in the Personnel Decree were based on a projection that the \nresident population at the subject institutions for the retarded would be 4700 822*822 as of \nJuly 19, 1978.[16] In their wisdom, however, the parties provided for flexibility in assessing \nstaffing needs. They recognized that the population of any school might increase over the \nyears, or decrease through attrition and appropriate community placements. And so, the \nPersonnel Decree was drafted to provide for corresponding adjustments in staffing levels as \nthe populations of the institutions either increased or decreased.[17] The parties themselves \nare charged with monitoring the changing population patterns. When the parties agree on \ncurrent staffing needs, the defendants must implement appropriate staffing changes. In the \nevent of a disagreement not resolvable by the parties, the Personnel Decree provides that \nthey will bring such impasse \"... to the attention of the court for its resolution.\"[18] \nOn June 26, 1981, the defendants notified the court that they intended to decrease the \nstaffing levels at the state schools, and that the plaintiffs were not in agreement with the \nplanned reductions. The parties filed a joint motion for a hearing on the defendants' plan. In \nresponse to an inquiry from the court, the defendants stated that they did not believe the \ncourt's approval was required before the adjustments could be instituted, despite the \nobjections of the plaintiffs and the plain language of the decree. On July 27, 1981, therefore, \nthis court issued an order temporarily restraining defendants from \"implementing any plan \nfor reduction of personnel at the state schools, either by imposing a hiring freeze or by \nterminating existing personnel.\" A hearing on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction \nwas held on August 12, 1981. Rather than continuing to oppose the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, however, defendants agreed to maintain the existing level of personnel pending \nthis court's determination as to the merits of their proposed reduction. \nII \nThe Personnel Decree \nThe Personnel Decree is straightforward in its terms. It states, \n[t]he defendants' continuing commitment under the terms of this Decree is to comply with \nthe personnel standards for care and treatment set forth in Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, and regulations promulgated thereunder.[19] \nIt requires defendants to provide \"direct care staff ... deemed adequate by [the Department \nof Public Health] to meet each resident's needs as specified in individual service plans.\"[20] \nUnder the terms of the decree, defendants are to engage in aggressive recruiting and \ntraining of personnel, and to use their best efforts to minimize vacancies and absenteeism \nby various means including salary increases and contracting of services.[21] The decree also \nmakes explicit the parties' assumption that \"direct-care staff should not perform support \nservices, and that non-professional direct-care staff are competent to provide appropriate \nservices to residents when adequately supervised.\"[22] \nAs noted earlier, the Personnel Decree provides for adjustments in staffing. If, for example, \nthe resident population is reduced by transfers to community settings, the defendants are \n\nobligated to \"shift resources\" into those settings and \"to provide adequate training programs \nfor staff\" assigned to the community placements.[23] \nThe Personnel Decree anticipates possible adjustments in staffing levels consistent with the \nneeds of a reduced population. But no formula is provided for accomplishing that end. The \nDecree makes no reference 823*823 whatsoever to client-staff ratios. It contains no \nsuggestion that a statistical, \"ratio\" adjustment would be an acceptable basis for \ndetermining future staffing levels. Indeed, the careful analyses and prolonged negotiations \nthat preceded the entry of the Decree, and the extraordinary effort which went into \ndevelopment of its original requirements,[24] would make such a purely mathematical \napproach untenable. To the contrary, the Decree calls for careful, individualized analysis of \neach resident's needs. That requirement is underscored by its mandate that the defendants \nprovide direct-care staffing \"adequate ... to meet each resident's needs as specified in \nindividual service plans.\"[25] Based on the evidence presented, the language of the Decree \nand the history of the negotiation process, the court determines that the parties did not \nintend to adopt a statistical, formulaic approach to assessing current staffing needs. \nThe Personnel Decree requires that the defendants \"comply with the personnel standards \nfor care and treatment set forth in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, \nand regulations promulgated thereunder.\"[26] Title XIX in turn sets forth two conditions \nrelevant here. First, residents of \"intermediate care facilities,\" must be provided with \"a \nwritten plan of service prior to admission.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(31)(A). Second, they must \nreceive \"active treatment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(2). \nThe interim consent decrees, which incorporate the Personnel Decree, spell out these \nrequirements in greater detail. The Wrentham decree,[27] for example, incorporates the \nPersonnel Decree to the extent it applies to Wrentham residents. It requires defendants to \nfurnish all clients with a written individual service plan[28] \nwhich specifies in detail the individual's capabilities and needs for services, ... [including his] \nresidential and program needs, vocational and work needs and capabilities, medical needs, \npsychological needs, equipment needs, guardianship needs, and habilitation needs as a \nwhole, including all education, recreation, speech therapy, physical therapy, support \nservices, and other services required by this Decree to meet the needs of the individual.[29] \nThe staff at Wrentham must be \"sufficient ... to meet each individual's residential and \nprogram needs as specified in the individual service plan.\"[30] Thus under the terms of the \ndecrees any diminution in personnel may not reduce the level of services below that which \nis required by Title XIX and the decrees themselves. \nIII \nThe Law \nConsent decrees which are negotiated and agreed upon by litigants, and formally approved \nby the court, are binding orders that \"have the same force and effect as any other judgment \nuntil set aside in the manner provided by law.\" United States v. Kellum, 523 F.2d 1284, \n\n1287 (5th Cir. 1975). See also Interdynamics v. Firma Wolf, 653 F.2d 93, 96-97 (3rd Cir. \n1981). An order incorporating a consent decree may be enforced by a motion either for civil \ncontempt, AMF Inc. v. International Fiberglass Co., 469 F.2d 1063 (1st Cir. 1972) or \ncriminal contempt, U. S. v. Schafer, 600 F.2d 1251 (9th Cir. 1979). \nThus, although an order embodying a consent decree has some of the characteristics of a \ncontract, it is more than simply an agreement between the parties. \n824*824 [A consent] judgment is not an inter partes contract; the court is not properly a \nrecorder of contracts, but is an organ of government constituted to make judicial decisions \nand when it has rendered a consent judgment it has made an adjudication. \n1B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.409[5], at 1030 (2d ed. 1982), quoted in United States v. \nCity of Miami, Florida, 664 F.2d 435, 441 (5th Cir. 1981) (opinion of Rubin, J.). See AMF \nInc. v. International Fiberglass Co., supra, at 1065. \nThe force and validity of a consent decree as a binding adjudication derives from the careful \nconsideration given by the court to the constitutional and statutory policies underlying the \nsettlement, and to the interests of all parties and the general public. \nIn assessing the propriety of giving judicial imprimatur to the consent decree, the court must \nalso consider the nature of the litigation and the purposes to be served by the decree. If the \nsuit seeks to enforce a statute, the decree must be consistent with the public objectives \nsought to be attained by Congress.... Voluntary compliance will frequently contribute \nsignificantly toward ultimate achievement of statutory goals.... Defendants \"minimize costly \nlitigation and adverse publicity and avoid the collateral effects of adjudicated guilt.\" United \nStates v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d [1147] at 1152 n.9. Therefore, willing compliance will be \nmore readily generated by consent decrees than would mandates imposed at the end of \nbitter and protracted litigation. \nUnited States v. City of Miami, Florida, supra, at 441-42. \nIn public law litigation, the court must also satisfy itself that there has been no collusion \namong the parties and that all branches of government have had the opportunity to \nparticipate in the fashioning of the decree, and have evidenced support for them. In those \ninstances, consent decrees carry with them \"a presumption of validity that is overcome only \nif [they] contain[] provisions which are unreasonable, illegal, unconstitutional, or against \npublic policy.\" United States v. City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358, 1362 (5th Cir. 1980). \nWhere a court gives careful consideration to the terms and effect of a decree before \napproving it, and the decree over time proves to be an effective device for remedying \nongoing, persistent constitutional deprivation, its value should be preserved and its proper \nimplementation insured by careful court monitoring. When proper compliance with the \ndecrees becomes a disputed issue not resolvable in the ordinary course of court \nsupervision, hearings may be necessary to determine whether compliance is possible and, \nif so, whether it has been accomplished. \n\nThe court, in assessing efforts to comply with the decrees, should not apply inflexible, \nabsolute standards, particularly where elaborate and complex performance is called for. But \ndefendants fairly may be held to the requirement that they be \"reasonably diligent and \nenergetic in attempting to accomplish what was ordered.\" Palmigiano v. Garrahy, 448 \nF.Supp. 659, 670 (D.R.I.1978) (quoting Aspira of New York v. Board of Education of City of \nNew York, 423 F.Supp. 647, 654 (S.D.N.Y.1976)). The test is \"whether defendants took `all \nthe reasonable steps within their power to insure compliance with the orders.'\" Palmigiano \nv. Garrahy, supra, quoting Sekaquaptewa v. MacDonald, 544 F.2d 396, 406 (9th Cir. 1976), \ncert. denied, 430 U.S. 931, 97 S.Ct. 1550, 51 L.Ed.2d 774 (1977). Although a court may \norder a defendant to \"do an impossibility, and then punish him for refusal to perform it,\" \nMaggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 59, 68 S.Ct. 401, 403, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948) (quoting and \nvacating sub nom. In re Luma Camera Service, Inc., 157 F.2d 951, 955 (2d Cir. 1946)), the \nburden is clearly on the defendant, where relief from the order is sought, to prove that he is \nunable to comply with it. Palmigiano v. Garrahy, supra, at 671. \nThe requirement that parties to a consent decree take \"all reasonable steps within their \npower,\" Palmigiano v. Garrahy, supra, at 670, to comply with its terms 825*825 applies with \nequal force to private and public litigants. State defendants, too, must demonstrate that they \nhave made a good faith effort to comply with a consent decree in order for modification to \nbe warranted. Philadelphia Welfare Rights Organization v. Shapp, 602 F.2d 1114, 1120 (3rd \nCir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1026, 100 S.Ct. 689, 62 L.Ed.2d 660 (1980). \nA defendant who seeks modification of a consent decree must demonstrate that the \ndangers which the decree was designed to avert \"have become attenuated to a shadow.\" \nUnited States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119, 52 S.Ct. 460, 464, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932). \nThus, \"[n]othing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and \nunforeseen conditions should lead [a court] to change what was decreed after years of \nlitigation with the consent of all concerned.\" Id. Even in the case of decrees signed by state \nofficials, the burden of demonstrating circumstances warranting modification, where \"the \ndefendants made a free, calculated, and deliberate choice to submit to an agreed upon \ndecree rather than seek a more favorable litigated judgment ... is perhaps ... more \nformidable than had they litigated and lost.\" Philadelphia Welfare Rights Organization, \nsupra.[31] \nIn this case, the consent decrees were negotiated and agreed upon by the parties, and \nformally approved by this court, after it considered thoroughly the constitutional and \nstatutory bases of the decrees and their possible impact on the parties. All branches of the \ngovernment participated in the fashioning of the decrees, and consistently have expressed \nsupport for them. No evidence exists of collusion that would call into question their validity. \nEffective as court orders, they constitute an adjudication that is binding and enforceable. \nSee 1B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.409[5], supra; U. S. v. City of Miami, Florida, supra; \nAMF Inc. v. International Fiberglass Co., supra. \nThis court has carefully monitored compliance with all of the consent decrees, with the \nassistance of personnel that the Commonwealth employs in an office established for that \npurpose. The immediate dispute surrounding the defendants' efforts to substantially \ndiminish the staff of personnel employed at the schools requires this court to determine \n\nwhat level of staffing is required by the decrees, and the extent to which the proposed \nreduction undermines defendants' ability to comply with them. \nThe issues facing this court are distinguishable from those addressed by the Courts of \nAppeals for the Second and First Circuits, respectively, in recent cases involving disputes \nabout compliance with consent decrees. \nIn New York State Assoc. for Retarded Children v. Carey, 631 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1980), the \nSecond Circuit reversed the trial court's order adjudging the Governor of New York in \ncontempt of a consent judgment which, inter alia, required him to \"take all actions \nnecessary to secure implementation of the steps, standards and procedures contained in \n[the] judgment ... [and to] ... take all steps necessary to ensure the full and timely financing \nof this judgment, including, if necessary, submission of appropriate budget requests....\" Id. \nat 163. The trial court had found that, although the Governor had acted \"entirely in good \nfaith,\" id. at 164, he should have used certain discretionary funds at his disposal to \nsupplement the legislature's inadequate appropriation. The trial court, therefore, ordered \nthat the Governor and Comptroller be held in contempt if adequate funding was not \nprovided. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the Governor could obey the trial \ncourt's order only by violating the constitution and laws of New York. \nThe Court of Appeals in Carey held that it was beyond the district court's power to interfere \nwith the appropriations processes of an unwilling legislature. Noting that 826*826 the district \ncourt's order required \"a state official [to] expend state funds for a purpose expressly \ndisallowed by the state legislature,\" id. at 165, the court stated, \n[i]n the face of constitutional violations at a state institution, a federal court can order the \nstate either to take the steps necessary to rectify the violations or to close the institution. \nThus a state cannot avoid the obligation of correcting the constitutional violations of its \ninstitutions simply by pleading fiscal inability.... But that remedy leaves the question of \nexpenditure of state funds in the hands of citizens of the state, not in the hands of federal \njudges. \nId. at 165 (cites omitted) (emphasis supplied). \nThe considerations raised in Carey are clearly distinguishable from those involved here. \nThe holding in Carey was premised on the district court's finding that \nGovernor Carey ha[d] complied with the Consent Judgment by taking all steps within his \nlawful authority to secure funding for the panel. \nId. at 163. Further, the Court of Appeals was influenced by the fact that the district court's \norder gave the Governor the Hobson's Choice of violating either the state constitution or a \nfederal court order. Significant also is the fact that the dispute in Carey involved the \nlegislature's refusal to fund a court monitor's office, the deprivation of which the court \ndetermined to be of less than constitutional dimension. \n[T]here is no basis for additionally assuming that, by itself, the state's refusal to fund the \nReview Panel, which was established by the Consent Judgment, violates the Constitution. \n\nId. at 165. \nHere, however, we are dealing with the issue of maintaining direct patient care at a level \nconsistent with constitutional and statutory mandates. The fundamental question presented \nis whether these consent decrees — the agreed upon means for eliminating chronic \nconstitutional deprivation at our institutions for the retarded — are being complied with. To \nresolve that issue this court must determine which, if any, of defendants' 408 proposed staff \ncuts can be made without endangering the constitutional protection intended and afforded \nby the consent decrees. \nHence in the instant case, unlike Carey, the court is neither examining the legislature's \nbudgetary decisions nor the good faith efforts, to date, of the defendants. The court is \nmerely asked to determine what actions are required of state executive officials to insure \nthe Commonwealth's continued compliance with these decrees. Cf. Coalition for Basic \nHuman Needs v. King, 654 F.2d 838, 842 (1st Cir. 1981) (distinguishing legislative from \nexecutive action).[32] \nThe issue here also is materially different from that in Brewster v. Dukakis, 675 F.2d 1 (1st \nCir. 1982). As shall be demonstrated in Section IVB, infra, a failure by the legislature to \nappropriate sufficient funds here eventually would result in a return to the medieval \ncustodial practices of a decade ago.[33] Unlike Brewster, which concerned new community \nprograms, inadequate funding here would lead to a dismantling of ongoing programs which \nin the past few 827*827 years have benefited thousands of class members who may now \nhave a legitimate basis for expecting their continuation. A failure to fund could, therefore, \nraise the question as to whether these class members have now acquired a right to \ncontinued funding based on the legislative and executive branches' clear and ongoing \ncommitment to the decrees. In other contexts, the Massachusetts courts have themselves \nrecognized that an obligation lawfully incurred by the executive or judicial branch can be \nenforced, even absent a specific legislative appropriation. O'Coins Inc. v. Treasurer of \nCounty of Worcester, 362 Mass. 507, 287 N.E.2d 608 (1972); U. S. Trust Co. v. \nCommonwealth, 348 Mass. 378, 204 N.E.2d 300 (1965). \nBecause the Decree expressly bars unilateral reductions in personnel, this court has the \nobligation to determine the level of staffing necessary to assure compliance with the \nDecree, and to require defendants to maintain previous staffing levels pending such a \ndetermination. Brewster does not suggest that the Commonwealth could not agree to \nmaintain existing staffing levels while the issue of staffing needs was being resolved. To the \ncontrary, the Decree manifests the parties' intention to maintain the status quo pending the \ncourt's resolution of disputes concerning staffing levels. And unlike Brewster, where the \ndefendants acknowledged noncompliance but argued impossibility of performance, \ndefendants here maintain that the reduction of 408 was clinically appropriate and in keeping \nwith the mandate of the consent decrees. \nFurther, the defendants here have not suggested that the executive branch was not \nauthorized to enter into the decrees, nor to assume the legal obligations contained therein. \nThey have not argued, as indeed they could not, that the legislature did not intend the state \nto become bound by the decrees. The legislative leadership has expressed unqualified \nsupport for full implementation of the decrees in hearings before this court. The legislature \n\nas a whole has funded them. The defendants have never challenged this court's jurisdiction \nto enforce the consent decrees. \nMoreover, the Eleventh Amendment is not implicated here because any relief ordered \nwould be prospective in nature, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 \nL.Ed.2d 662 (1974); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2573, 57 L.Ed.2d \n522 (1978), and would give the defendants the choice of complying with the court's order or \nclosing the schools. See Ad Hoc Committee on Judicial Administration v. Massachusetts, \n488 F.2d 1241, 1245-46 (1st Cir. 1973) cert. denied 416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2389, 40 \nL.Ed.2d 763 (1974); Welsch v. Likins, 550 F.2d 1122, 1132 (8th Cir. 1977). \nThis case is similar to Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289-90, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761-62, 53 \nL.Ed.2d 745 (1977), where the Court held that a state may be required to pay a portion of a \nremedial education program designed to eliminate the effects of de jure segregation. The \nCourt found that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar such relief, under the principles set \nforth in Edelman. \nThe decree to share the future costs of educational components in this case fits squarely \nwithin the prospective compliance exception reaffirmed by Edelman. That exception, which \nhad its genesis in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 [28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714] (1908), \npermits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct to requirements of \nfederal law, notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury. 415 U.S., \nat 667 [94 S.Ct., at 1357]. The order challenged here does no more than that. The decree \nrequires state officials, held responsible for unconstitutional conduct, in findings which are \nnot challenged, to eliminate a de jure segregated school system.... \nThese programs were not, and as a practical matter could not be, intended to wipe the slate \nclean by one bold stroke, as could a retroactive award of money in Edelman. Rather, by the \nnature of the antecedent violation, ... the victims of Detroit's de jure segregated system will \ncontinue to experience the effects of segregation 828*828 until such future time as the \nremedial programs can help dissipate the continuing effects of past misconduct. Reading \nand speech deficiencies cannot be eliminated by judicial fiat; they will require time, \npatience, and the skills of specially trained teachers. That the programs are also \n\"compensatory\" in nature does not change the fact that they are part of a plan that operates \nprospectively to bring about the delayed benefits of a unitary school system. We therefore \nhold that such prospective relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \nId. (footnotes omitted). Here, compliance with the consent decrees is necessary to insure \nthat the retarded will have the continuing benefit of direct care programs which the parties \nthemselves agreed were necessary to meet constitutional and Title XIX standards. Given an \nintransigent legislature, essential remedial effort called for by the consent decrees may \npermissibly have \"... a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury.\" Id. at 289, 97 \nS.Ct. at 2762. On that score, it is reasonable to have in mind the Governor's well publicized \npronouncements that, under his stewardship, the Commonwealth's treasury now enjoys a \n100 million dollar surplus. \nIV \n\nThe Defendants' Effort at Compliance With the \nPersonnel Decree \nThe defendants contend that their across-the-board reduction of 408 staff positions is \nconsistent with a perceived \"ratio of staff to client census set forth in the personnel consent \ndecree.\"[34] They also argue that a staff reduction of 408 will not compromise their \nobligations under the Personnel Decree. They maintain that the figure 408 was chosen only \nafter thorough consideration of the needs of the clients and the views of qualified individuals \nresponsible for the administration of the institutions. Finally, the defendants say that they \nmade the necessary effort to \"secure sufficient appropriations from the General Court to \nmaintain compliance with the requirements of the consent decrees.\"[35] \nGovernor King's 1982 budget request of the General Court called for a 5.1 million dollar cut \nin spending for personnel at the five state schools for the retarded which are subject to the \nPersonnel Decree.[36] This reduction in requested funding corresponded to the Governor's \nproposed 408 staff position cut. Contrary to the provisions of the decree, the Governor's \nstaff and budget cuts were undertaken without plaintiffs' agreement or the permission of this \ncourt. According to the affidavits of Governor King, former Secretary Mahoney (of the \nExecutive Office of Human Services) and former Secretary Hanley (of the Executive Office \nfor Administration and Finance),[37] Secretary Mahoney was initially informed by the \nCommissioner of Mental Health and his staff that the staffing levels at the five state schools \ncould be reduced in a way that was \"clinically appropriate and that ... conformed to all legal \nrequirements of the Personnel Decree and other consent decrees ....\"[38] Governor King's \nunderstanding, according to his affidavit, was that permissible staff reductions could be \naccomplished because of projected decreases in the institutions' resident population due to \nattrition and community placements.[39] \n829*829 Contrary to defendants' assertions, plaintiffs maintain that the proposed 408 \nperson staff cut was a response to budgetary pressure and was not based on an analysis of \nclient needs. Plaintiffs assert that the original impetus for the challenged reduction came, \nnot from professionals within the Department of Mental Health, but from Secretary \nMahoney, whose purported instruction to then Assistant Commissioner for Mental \nRetardation Linda Glenn was to cut the Department of Mental Health budget by a certain \ndollar figure. Plaintiffs contend that, once given Secretary Mahoney's mandate, \nCommissioner Glenn set out to identify positions sufficient in number to meet the \npredetermined budget cut, without regard to the individual needs of the resident population. \nThe First Circuit has recently clarified the standards to be utilized in examining whether \nstate defendants have complied with the requirements of consent decrees involving public \nlaw litigation. In Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, 668 F.2d \n602, 607-608 (1st Cir. 1981), the court stated, \n[a]t the outset, we note that consent decrees, at least when entered into by private parties, \nare often viewed as contracts, interpretation of which depends in part upon language, in \npart upon the circumstances surrounding their formation, and in part upon the basic \npurposes of the decree. United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223 [95 S.Ct. \n926, 43 L.Ed.2d 148] (1975). We recognize that programmatic decrees in public law \n\nlitigation may call for somewhat more flexible interpretation in light of the need to achieve \ntheir basic purposes (the eradication of unconstitutional conditions) and the need to \naccommodate the differing competencies of different branches of government as well as the \ndiffering needs and interests of the parties.... These considerations, along with the \ntraditional tools of language, circumstance, and purpose, are determinative of the case \nbefore us. \nThus where traditional contract principles would lead to an interpretation which is overly \nrigid, or which ignores the distinct functions and capabilities of the different branches of \ngovernment, the court must be willing to look outside of the decree for guidance in \nconstruing it. \nNo such exigent circumstances exist here, however. The Personnel Decree, and the \nunderlying consent decrees, are clear and unambiguous. They require the defendants to \ncomply with Title XIX and its regulations, and to provide class members with active \ntreatment administered by qualified personnel pursuant to detailed individual service plans. \nThey require the state to do no more than that which it must do under federal statutes in \norder to qualify for federal funding of a program in which it is participating voluntarily. \nThe basic purpose of these decrees is to eradicate unconstitutional conditions by assuring \ncompliance with federal statutory standards.[40] The defendants are charged with executive \nresponsibility for operating the Commonwealth's schools for the retarded. Consistent with \nthat responsibility, the Governor and his staff have an obligation to prepare and submit a \nbudget request to the General Court that reflects the level of appropriation necessary to \ncomply with the Title XIX standards which permeate these decrees. \nThe magnitude of the effort that all parties devoted to the drafting of these decrees \nunderscores the seriousness with which they approached the question of personnel. The \namount of thought, study, and negotiation devoted to developing the original staffing levels \nindicates the complex confluence of factors which must be considered in determining \nstaffing needs. The requirement of Paragraph 10 of the Personnel Decree that 830*830 the \nparties submit disagreements concerning the level of staffing to this court for resolution \ndemonstrates an intention that personnel reductions be implemented only after a careful \nanalysis of the clinical, educational, and other needs of the individual clients. Neither the \nparties nor the court contemplated that the court's supervisory role would be merely to \nresolve disputes by determining the correct computation of some mathematical ratio. \nMoreover, the Decree reflects sensitivity to the budgetary and administrative limitations on \nthe Commonwealth's ability to provide optimum staffing levels. It requires only that the \ndefendants comply with the Title XIX standards to which the Commonwealth is already \ncommitted, and that active treatment thereby be provided to all class members pursuant to \nindividual service plans. \nA) The Proposed Reduction \nDefendants maintain that their proposed reduction of 408 staff positions is clinically \nappropriate and would not detract from their ability to comply with the Personnel Decree \nand the five consent decrees. Although defendants admit that they used a mathematical \n\nanalysis to establish the upper limit of the proposed reduction, they argue that they adopted \nthe final figure of 5.1 million dollars only after consideration of client needs and changing \ninstitutional conditions. They seem to suggest, as well, that the Governor's submission of a \nreduced budget was intended to forestall a larger and more devastating cut in the Mental \nHealth Department's budget by the legislature. \nThe evidence persuades this court that the Governor's decision to reduce the budget by 5.1 \nmillion dollars was primarily a budgetary one. Any analyses that were conducted did not \ntake sufficient account of client needs or the decree requirements. The device of seeking a \n5.1 million dollars reduction in order to avoid a greater one by the legislature was ill-advised \nat best, and contravened the mandates of the decrees, at the very least.[41] \nThe relevant budgetary process began in September 1980,[42] when the superintendents of \nthe five state schools submitted to the Department of Mental Health, and particularly \nCommissioner Glenn,[43] their proposed fiscal year 1982 budgets.[44] Their proposals did not \ncall for reductions in staffing levels,[45] even though they were aware that the population of \nthe institutions had diminished since the consent decrees were signed,[46] and that a large \nnumber of community placements were anticipated for fiscal year 1982. Based in part on \nthe Superintendents' requests, the Department of Mental Health recommended to the \nExecutive Office of Human Services that the consent decrees again be \"fully funded,\" and \nthat the operating budget of the state schools be increased.[47] Thus the Department's \noriginal budget request, submitted in October 1980, called for an increase in expenditures \nfor the five state schools for the retarded. \n831*831 In early October 1980, after the Department submitted its initial budget request \ntotaling approximately 558 million dollars,[48] Secretary Mahoney and his staff directed the \nDepartment to reduce its request by approximately 50 million dollars. According to \nCommissioner Glenn, Mr. Mahoney's office did not instruct the Department to cut the \npersonnel budget specifically.[49] The impetus for the personnel cut came from Glenn herself \nwho, in a memo of November 24, 1980 to the Assistant Secretary of the Executive Office of \nHuman Services (EOHS)[50] proposed a 5.1 million dollar reduction in funding for personnel \nat the state schools for the retarded. Her proposal postdated several meetings with \nSecretary Mahoney, his staff, and her superiors at the Department of Mental Health,[51] as \nwell as internal analyses conducted by Ms. Glenn's staff. \nThe 5.1 million dollar reduction was approved by the EOHS and was included in the \nGovernor's budget request of January 1981. But, the superintendents were not informed \nthat their personnel budgets were to be significantly reduced until March 1981.[52] It was not \nuntil May 18, 1981 that they were told the amount of the reduction, and what portion of it \neach institution was expected to absorb.[53] \nMs. Glenn testified that she had discussed the possibility of personnel reductions with two \nof the superintendents[54] and with other officials in the Department of Mental Health, \nincluding then Commissioner Okin,[55] before the directive from Secretary Mahoney's office \nwas issued. But she also stated that, had she not received Mahoney's directive she would \nnot have submitted a reduced budget.[56] She did not, before receiving the directive, tell the \nsuperintendents that their proposed budgets were too high.[57] Moreover she did not, prior to \nthis hearing, inform this court that the level of personnel at the state schools could be \n\nsignificantly reduced without undermining defendants' compliance with the consent \ndecrees.[58] These facts, when viewed in light of the statements of the superintendents \nindicating that an immediate reduction in staffing could or would threaten their ability to \ncomply,[59] cast considerable doubt on the defendants' assertion that the proposed reduction \nis based on clinical considerations. \nDefendants admit, moreover, that the reduction was not based on a position-by-position \nexamination of staffing needs, nor even on an institution-by-institution analysis.[60] In fact, \nthe superintendents were initially instructed by the Department of Mental Health to reduce \ntheir budgets by certain dollar amounts, rather than to eliminate particular staff positions.[61] \nIt was not until long after the 5.1 million dollar reduction was formally submitted by the \nGovernor that the superintendents were asked to identify the positions to be eliminated.[62] \n832*832 Defendants' assertion that a reduction of 5.1 million dollars in the personnel \naccount for the state schools for the retarded is clinically appropriate[63] prompts this court to \nexamine closely the process defendants utilized in arriving at this figure. Upon being \ninstructed by Secretary Mahoney to reduce her budget request, Ms. Glenn initially looked to \nthe mental health side, rather than the mental retardation side, of the Department's budget. \nWhen reductions in the mental health portion proved insufficient to meet the 50 million dollar \nfigure imposed by Secretary Mahoney's office, she felt compelled to seek reductions in the \nmental retardation budget. \nMs. Glenn instructed David DeKing, then Director of Facility Support within the Division of \nRetardation, to prepare a report for her indicating the potential dollar savings in personnel if \nstaffing levels at the state schools were reduced to match the \"implied\" staff-client ratios \nreflected in the consent decrees.[64] A reduction was anticipated because of actual and \nexpected census decreases resulting from community placements and attrition, although \nthe possible transfer of clients from state mental institutions to the state schools for the \nretarded was also being considered. \nMr. DeKing spent only four to five hours on the project. His effort consisted of updating \ncensus and staffing information the Department already possessed, and compiling the \nnumbers to reflect possible dollar savings.[65] He arrived at two figures — a possible 10.5 \nmillion dollar reduction based on census figures up to fiscal year 1982, and a seventeen \nmillion dollar reduction based on census figures through fiscal year 1982. \nMs. Glenn then asked her staff, and particularly Mr. DeKing,[66] \"to take a hard look at what \nwithin the 10.5 would be reasonable ...\"[67] as a budgetary decrease, based on their \nknowledge of the state schools. Ms. Glenn testified that she discussed the staffing needs \nand the ramifications of the reductions with Mr. DeKing's supervisor, Mary Cliett, while \nDeKing was conducting the second phase of his analysis. But she conceded that her 5.1 \nmillion dollar budget cut recommendation to Secretary Mahoney was based on Mr. \nDeKing's five hour analysis and recommendation to her.[68] \nAlthough Ms. Glenn accepted Mr. DeKing's recommendation as clinically sound, she \nadmitted that she did not know whether he had spoken with any of the superintendents \nbefore arriving at his figure,[69] whether he consulted Hans Toegel, the head of the \nDepartment of Public Health Title XIX compliance team,[70] or whether, in fact, he had \n\nreviewed any individual service plans.[71] In fact, she did not ask him with whom he had \nspoken.[72] She \"assumed\" that he utilized data the Department of Mental Health had \nrecently developed through \"a very thorough analysis of the Active treatment provided each \nclient in each of the state schools for the mentally retarded.\"[73] \nThis court's comments are not intended as an indictment of Mr. DeKing. He is neither a \nclinician nor a management expert.[74] He was given only one week to complete his \nanalysis.[75] Given these circumstances, he was in no position to conduct 833*833 a detailed \nclinical study based on clients' individual service plans or the institutions' actual personnel \nneeds. Rather, he was asked to take \"a global look at the available staff and what [the \nDepartment] had already added\" as a result of the consent decrees.[76] \nMr. DeKing's second analysis, from which he derived the 5.1 million dollar figure, consisted \nof two components. He engaged in continuing discussions with clinicians in the central \noffice of the Department of Mental Health,[77] and he conducted further mathematical \ncalculations based on the \"implied ratios\" in the consent decrees, and projected census \nfigures. His testimony makes it clear, however, that he arrived at the 5.1 million figure \nprimarily through numerical manipulation. According to his testimony, Ms. Glenn was \nconcerned not so much with ascertaining the clinically appropriate level of personnel, but \nwith providing a \"buffer\"[78] for the 10.5 million dollar figure derived earlier through \napplication of the \"implied ratio.\" Mr. DeKing's second analysis was not based on \ndiscussions with the superintendents, the Department of Public Health Title XIX survey \noffice, nor with the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the federal \nagency charged with enforcing the requirements of Title XIX.[79] Instead he derived the 5.1 \nmillion dollar figure by recalculating the potential savings from community placements using \nonly one quarter of the projected FY81 placements.[80] This would, in his words, provide \"the \nbuffer that [the Department was] looking for to allow for if something happened with Title \nXIX.\"[81] \nMs. Glenn gave Mr. DeKing just one week to complete his analysis because, though it was \nadmittedly an important assignment, \"[i]t was also important to get a budget submitted to \n[Secretary] Mahoney that he could accept and support.\"[82] The Department of Mental \nHealth simply was not given enough time to conduct the type of analysis required to assure \nthe clinical appropriateness of a 5.1 million dollar staff reduction.[83] The analytical steps \nnecessary to assure adequate service delivery were outlined by Ms. Schwaninger in her \ntestimony before this court,[84] yet there is no evidence that the procedures she described \nwere[85] or are[86] being followed. Instead, the Department simply \"updated\"[87] the pre-\nPersonnel Decree studies by comparing the numbers of staff and clients anticipated in the \nconsent decrees with current staff-client ratios and projected census levels. The inadequacy \nof this approach becomes even more evident when one considers Ms. Glenn's concern \nover the credibility of the Title XIX analysis recently conducted by the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, which was far more involved and detailed than \nMr. DeKing's analysis.[88] \nThe assessment conducted by Linda Glenn and her staff did not address itself to the \nquestion of whether a reduction could be accomplished without undermining consent \ndecree and Title XIX compliance. Rather, her prime concern was to find a way to meet \nSecretary Mahoney's mandate 834*834 that the budget be cut.[89] Moreover, the \n\nDepartment knew or reasonably should have known that its recommendation would not \nobviate greater reductions by the legislature. In fact it had every reason to believe that the \nlegislature would further reduce its budget.[90] \nThe Department's recommendation that 5.1 million dollars be cut from the personnel budget \nis admittedly based on ratios impermissably derived from the consent decrees.[91] \nDefendants' assumption that staffing reductions may be determined by merely applying \nratios is just plain wrong.[92] A variety of factors must be considered in order to make a \nclinically meaningful determination of client need and consent decree compliance. These \ninclude the number of community placements.[93] changes in the physical layout of new and \nrenovated buildings,[94] and the changing configuration of client characteristics.[95] None of \nthese factors was adequately considered by defendants, either before or since the \nrecommendation to cut 5.1 million dollars was made. \nB) The Osborn Report \nThe testimony of various Department of Mental Health employees thus made it clear that \nthe decision to reduce personnel at the five state schools for the retarded by 408 was \nprimarily a budgetary decision, rather than a clinical one. But the question remained in this \ncourt's mind as to whether some reduction in personnel could be accomplished without \nviolating the consent decrees and Title XIX requirements. \nIn an effort to resolve that issue, this court requested the assistance of Dr. Lawrence A. \nOsborn. Dr. Osborn[96] is the Associate Regional Administrator for Health Standards and \nQuality (HSQ) in the Region I Office of the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices.[97] He is charged with determining whether the Commonwealth is meeting Title \nXIX requirements. He has at his disposal the analytic and investigative resources, including \nhis own and his colleagues' professional expertise and the survey capabilities and Title XIX \nexperience, of his regional office. At the court's request, Dr. Osborn supervised a limited \nstudy of the five state schools in late 1981 and early 1982, which was supplemented by an \nanalysis conducted in late January and early February 1982.[98] Dr. Osborn's conclusion, \nbased on these studies, is that only 84.5 of the 408 positions can be 835*835 eliminated \nwithout endangering consent decree compliance.[99] \nDr. Osborn's initial study included onsite visits at each of the five state schools by joint \nfederal-state survey teams headed by Qualified Mental Retardation Professionals.[100] They \nanalyzed data from recent DPH surveys of the schools, DMH \"Clinical Impact Analyses,\" \naffidavits submitted by the superintendents to this court, and materials provided by the court \nmonitor's office.[101] Although Dr. Osborn's office has responsibility only for the Medicaid \npopulation of the state schools, the initial study, which used a total sample of 105 clients,[102] \nincluded a review of non-Medicaid records in approximately the same proportion as exists \nat the schools generally.[103] And while, according to Dr. Osborn, both studies suffered from \na bias in favor of showing more active treatment rendered and fewer Title XIX deficiencies \nthan is actually the case,[104] this bias was taken into account when the final \nrecommendations were prepared.[105] \nAlthough Dr. Osborn tended to resolve doubts about the necessity of retaining particular \npositions in favor of retention, this was not always the case.[106] His supplemental report \n\nproperly reflected a willingness to eliminate a particular position when there were no \nsignificant Title XIX deficiencies related to the position, when there was a clear \nadministrative justification presented for the reduction, and when there was no credible \ncontradictory evidence offered by the plaintiffs in support of retention.[107] \nDr. Osborn's reports indicate that, while there have been dramatic improvements in the \nphysical conditions and treatment rendered at the five state schools for the retarded since \nthe consent decrees were initially implemented,[108] deficiencies in service delivery and Title \nXIX compliance remain.[109] More relevant to the issue presently before this court, the \nOsborn reports make it clear that eliminating the 408 positions originally targeted by \ndefendants would seriously jeopardize defendants' ability to comply with the consent \ndecrees and Title XIX.[110] Indeed, Dr. Osborn stated that a reduction of the magnitude \ndefendants propose would almost certainly lead to a regression in the quality of care and \nphysical well-being of residents to a level comparable to that existing before these suits \nwere instituted.[111] \nIt is significant to note as well that his report suggests that a reduction of five million dollars \nin the budget of the five state schools could have been accomplished without undermining \nconsent decree and Title XIX compliance had the school superintendents initially been \ngiven greater flexibility to allocate the reduction among different operating accounts.[112] \nThat finding underscores the weakness of defendants' ratio-based approach to cost \ncontainment. \n836*836 Although the Osborn study was conducted in a relatively short period of time and \nsuffers from some empirical weaknesses, which were fully illuminated in the reports \nthemselves[113] and in Dr. Osborn's testimony,[114] the court finds it to be an objective, \ncredible, and valid analysis. Dr. Osborn and his assistants did not assume, before \nconducting the study, that any reduction would necessarily violate Title XIX, nor did they \nview it as their duty to provide a justification for the reductions proposed by the \nCommonwealth.[115] Moreover, they relied on a vast amount of information supplied by \ndefendants, plaintiffs, and the Court Monitor's office, and utilized sound analytical \nguidelines[116] in arriving at their recommendation. Thus the court accepts Dr. Osborn's \nconclusion that only 84.5 of the 408 targeted positions may be reduced without serious \njeopardy to the standard of direct care and treatment now being provided at the state \nschools. \nConclusion \nThe decrees that have guided the remedial phase of these cases are not the whim of the \nfederal court, nor do they represent an activist intrusion on the prerogatives of state \ngovernment. Rather, they represent an acknowledgment by the Commonwealth that, for too \nmany years, our retarded citizens were \"benignly\" permitted to exist in filth and squalor, \ndespite the best efforts of staff too few in number to have any chance of meeting their \nprofessional responsibilities. \nAfter viewing these state institutions, this court publicly termed them to be little more than \n\"pig pens\" and \"human warehouses.\"[117] That assessment was never challenged by any \nstate official. Indeed, the Attorney General himself termed conditions at these institutions to \n\nhave been \"indefensible.\"[118] His enlightened attitude led to the fashioning of these decrees, \nwhich have taken the retarded from a snake pit environment to one enabling them to \nsurvive their misfortune under conditions that at least minimally demonstrate the \nCommonwealth's regard for their human dignity. \nThe terms of those decrees were not imposed by the federal court. Capital renovations \nwere bargained for and agreed to by the parties, building by building, room by room. \nStaffing requirements were bargained for and agreed to by the parties on, literally, a \nposition-by-position basis. \nThe common and consistent criterion throughout the bargaining process was NEED. The \nparties strove to determine what capital and staffing improvements were necessary to \npermit the retarded to live with the degree of human dignity required under our Constitution. \nThese decrees represent the parties' response to that question — a response that \ntranscended either liberal or conservative political points of view. \nThe Commonwealth has always had limited resources. Mindful of that fact, the parties \ncrafted the terms of these decrees with an eye toward insuring that the people of this state \nwould receive a full measure of value for every tax dollar devoted to the success of this \nambitious but constitutionally necessary remedial undertaking. \nToday's fiscal problems do not alter the fact that these decrees are essential to insure that \nthere will be no return to the \"indefensible\" conditions of the past. The retarded have no \npotent political constituency. They must rely on the good will of those of us more fortunate \nthan they, and the Constitution which controls the manner in which all of us must meet our \nvaried responsibilities. \n837*837 This court concludes that in unilaterally seeking a 408 person staff cut, and an \nancillary 5.1 million dollar budget cut, defendants have failed to meet their responsibilities to \nthe retarded under the terms of these decrees. Mindful that there must be ever-vigilant \nmonitoring to achieve cost containment and savings whenever possible, this court \ndetermines that certain staffing reductions may be made by the defendants without violating \nthe applicable consent decrees or the requirements of Title XIX. Those reductions are set \nforth in the attached appendix. \nAn order will issue. \nORDER \n1) Defendants' request for permission to reduce by 408 the number of staff positions at \nstate institutions for the retarded would, if granted, render them unable to comply with the \napplicable consent decrees. That request is, therefore, denied. \n2) The defendants may eliminate those positions designated in the Appendix to the opinion \nfiled herewith, without breaching their obligations under the applicable consent decrees or \nthe orders of this court. \n\n3) The defendants are to take all steps within their lawful authority to insure compliance with \nthis order, and to secure the funding necessary for compliance with the consent decrees. \nPalmigiano v.

The first suit, challenging living and treatment conditions \nat Belchertown, was filed on February 7, 1972. Four additional suits concerning Fernald, Dever, Monson and \nWrentham were filed later and then consolidated. After literally hundreds of hours of effort by the parties and the \ncourt, interim and final consent decrees covering these institutions were filed. These decrees were complemented by \nthe filing of the Personnel Decree which is the immediate subject of this opinion. \n[2] Plaintiffs' Exh. 1, FINAL DECREE ON PERSONNEL AT THE FIVE STATE SCHOOLS FOR THE MENTALLY \nRETARDED, ¶ 10, states:  \nPrior to any decision to adjust staffing at any state school, the defendants agree to consult with the plaintiffs' counsel \nand to bring any disagreement to the attention of the court for its resolution. \n[3] The across-the-board cuts would have reduced personnel at the institutions by 408. \n[4] The complaints variously alleged deprivation of the plaintiffs' due process rights to minimally adequate care and \ntreatment, and their rights under certain federal and Massachusetts statutes, including Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., and \nMass.Gen.Laws ch. 19 and ch. 123. Although not cited in the complaints, Part 1, Article X of the Massachusetts \n\nconstitution also provides that \"[e]ach individual of the society has the right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of \nhis life, liberty, and property, according to standing laws.\" \n[5] Certain officials of the Commonwealth who were originally named as defendants have left office since these suits \nwere instituted. Their successors in office have been or are in the process of being substituted as named defendants. \nIn addition to the superintendents at each of the institutions, the defendants include the Governor, the Secretary of \nHuman Services and the Commissioner of Mental Health. \n[6] Transcript of the July 25, 1977 Hearing at p. 17 (statement of Attorney General Francis Bellotti). \n[7] Memorandum of this court, September 11, 1981, p. 2. \n[8] In January 1979, Mr. Dukakis was succeeded as Governor by Edward King. Governor King accompanied the \ncourt on a view of Fernald on July 27, 1979 and expressed publicly his support for full funding and implementation of \nthe decrees. \n[9] Transcript of the July 25, 1977 Hearing at p. 12. \n[10] Id. at p. 16 (statement of Speaker McGee). \n[11] Id. at pp. 17-18 (statement of Attorney General Francis Bellotti). \n[12] Id. at p. 18. \n[13] The transcript of this court's recent evidentiary hearing concerning personnel needs details the painstaking steps \ntaken by all involved to develop a responsible Personnel Decree. Particularly enlightening is the Affidavit of \nBoisfeuillet Jones, Jr., former counsel to the Dever and Wrentham plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' Exh. 43, Affidavit of B. Jones, \nJr. ¶ 7 (8/11/81). Mr. Jones' recollections are consistent with this court's own, and with the testimony of other \nindividuals who participated in formulating the decree. Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 7-136 to 145 (12/2/81); Francis \nKelley, tr. 1-27 to 28 (9/3/81); Ronald Rosen, tr. 1-1000 (9/3/81); Ellsworth Pearl, tr. 2-5 (9/4/81). \n[14] Transcript of the September 5, 1980 Hearing at pp. 38-39 (statement of Senator Atkins). \n[15] Id. at p. 51.

The four remaining consent decrees contain similar \nrequirements. Dever Decree ¶ 6, ¶ 31; Belchertown Decree p. 10; Monson Decree ¶ 1, ¶ 4, ¶ 5; Fernald Decree ¶ \n1.4, ¶ 6, ¶ 10. \n[31] Defendants have not in the past, and do not now question the validity of the decrees themselves. Thus, the only \nissue presented here is the merit of defendants' proposed staff reductions. Cabrera v. Municipality of Bayamon, 622 \nF.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1980). \n[32] In determining the merit of defendants' proposed budget cuts, however, it has been necessary for this court to \nevaluate defendants' efforts to ascertain the level of staffing necessary to meet the Decree's requirements. Thus it is \nrelevant that, in contravention of the clear mandate of the Decree, the Governor acted unilaterally to cut staffing by \n408 and, to that end, cut his budget request of the legislature by 5.1 million dollars. The purported rationale behind \nthose cuts is discussed in Section IV, infra. \n[33] Dr. Osborn who is an Associate Regional Administrator with the U. S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, and on whom this court relied for guidance in determining what staffing levels are necessary under the \nDecree, see Section IVB, infra, stated that  \n[i]nstitutions of this size ... take years of hard work by all sorts of agencies and people and whatever to make the \nimprovements. They can regress to their former status at the speed of light. \nTestimony of Lawrence Osborn, tr. 10-54 (1/12/82). \n[34] Defendants' Pretrial Memorandum ¶ 1 (8/31/81). While the meaning of this phrase might otherwise have \nremained unclear, since there is no ratio \"set forth\" in the Personnel Decree, testimony offered at the hearing \nindicates that defendants derived the \"ratio\" by the comparing staffing and census levels anticipated by the consent \ndecrees. \n[35] Defendants' Pretrial Memorandum 1 (8/31/81). \n[36] Affidavit of Edward J. King, Plaintiffs' Exh. 56 ¶ 2. \n[37] See plaintiffs' Exh. 56, Exh. 57, and Exh. 58. \n[38] Plaintiffs' Exh. 57, Affidavit of Charles F. Mahoney, (7/31/81). \n[39] Even accepting the Governor's expression of understanding at face value, it is clear that the decrease he \nanticipated will not come about in the foreseeable future. The legislature did not provide any funds in the Fiscal Year \n1982 budget for community placements from the five state schools for the retarded. As a result, 485 clients who were \nexpected to be transferred out of their respective schools will remain institutionalized. There may, in addition, be an \nincrease over previous years in the number of individuals transferred back to the schools. Testimony of Kathy \nSchwaninger, tr. 3-120 to 121, 3-139, and 3-142 (11/20/81). \n[40] Plaintiffs' Exh. 1, PERSONNEL DECREE, ¶ 2. \n[41] The mere filing of a Special Message to the legislature might well be judged as having been less than a \n\"reasonably diligent and energetic [attempt] to accomplish\" compliance. Palmigiano v. Garrahy, supra, at 670. A \nSpecial Message unadorned by a significant, legitimate lobbying effect has the tactical punch of a paper airplane. \n\n[42] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-9 (12/1/81). \n[43] Then Assistant Commissioner for Mental Retardation, Ms. Glenn is now an Associate Commissioner of the \nDepartment of Mental Health. Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-6 (12/1/81). \n[44] Ms. Glenn testified that she began working on the proposed fiscal year 1982 budget during the summer of 1980. \nThere is no evidence that the work she did prior to September 1980 was related to personnel at the five state \nschools, however. \n[45] Testimony of Francis Kelley, tr. 1-88 (9/3/81); Ronald Rosen, tr. 1-103 (9/3/81); Ellsworth Pearl, tr. 2-62 to 2-63 \n(9/4/81). \n[46] See, for example, the testimony of Francis Kelley, tr. 1-88 (9/3/81). \n[47] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-13 (12/1/81). \n[48] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 8-52 (12/4/81). \n[49] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-14 (12/1/81). \n[50] Plaintiffs' Exh. 42. \n[51] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-18 and 6-19 (12/1/81). \n[52] Testimony of Ellsworth Pearl, tr. 2-10 (9/4/81). \n[53] Testimony of Ronald Rosen, tr. 1-104 (9/3/81); Francis Kelley 1-176 (9/3/81). \n[54] Testimony of Linda Glenn, tr. 6-49 to 6-59 (12/1/81). \n[55] Id., tr. 6-39. \n[56] Id., tr. 6-36. \n[57] Id., tr. 6-42. \n[58] Id., tr. 6-62. \n[59] Testimony of Francis Kelley, tr. 1-72 to 1-87; testimony of Ronald Rosen 1-111; Affidavit of W.

Testimony of \nLawrence Osborn, tr. 3-79 (11/20/81). \n[97] The Division of Health Standards and Quality is one of four divisions within the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's regional office in Boston. The Health Care Financing Administration office is, in turn, one part of the \nRegion I office of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

See attachments E and F to Exhibit 48. In the supplemental study \nDr. Osborn had an opportunity to refine his initial recommendations for reducing non-direct care personnel because \nof doubts he expressed about the validity of the original recommendation. \n[99] Id., tr. 11-6 (2/17/82). \n[100] 42 C.F.R.

Brooks, 145 F.3d 446, 455 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added). \n \nShared jurisdiction, however, is possible, and “flourishes in a circumscribed cluster of situations, the handling of which is not \ninconsistent with the prosecution of an appeal.” Id. at 456. \n \n4  A court may take “actions in aid of execution of a judgment that has been appealed and not stayed.” Id.; United States v. Hurley, \n63 F.3d 1, 23 (1st Cir.1995) (“But the [general] rule is not absolute, for even after the appeal is filed the district court retains \n \nauthority to decide matters not inconsistent with the pendency of the appeal.... A district court may, for example, ... act in aid of \nexecution of a judgment that has been appealed but not stayed.”). Other circuits, as well as leading federal practice authorities, take \na similar position with respect to unstayed judgments. See, e.g., Am. Town Ctr. v. Hall 83 Assoc., 912 F.2d 104, 110-111 (6th \nCir.1990) (“while as a general rule a notice of appeal divests the district court of its jurisdiction to expand upon an opinion, the \ndistrict court retains jurisdiction to enforce its judgment so long as the judgment has not been stayed or superseded.”) (internal \ncitations and quotations omitted); Nicol v. Gulf Fleet Supply Vessels, Inc., 743 F.2d 298, 299 n. 2 (5th Cir.1984) (“An exception to \nthis rule is that once a notice of appeal is filed the district court has jurisdiction to act to enforce its judgment so long as the \njudgment has not been stayed or superseded.”); 20-303 Moore’s Federal Practice-Civil § 303.32 (“Until the district court’s \njudgment is superseded or stayed, the judgment is fully in effect and the district court retains the authority to enforce the judgment. \nHowever, the district court may not enlarge or alter the scope of the judgment after a notice of appeal has been filed.”). \n \n5  See Memorandum [# 219] (“The court believes that the Commonwealth’s compliance with this order will remedy the systemic \nfailure identified.

Paragraph 7, which provides the grounds upon which \n \nPlaintiffs may re-open the case, provides in relevant part: \n7. a. If the defendants substantially fail to provide a state ISP process in compliance with this Order, or if there is a systemic \nfailure to provide services to class members as described in this Order, the plaintiffs may seek enforcement of the Order \npursuant to this paragraph.

See, \ne.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 193, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976) (“[L]limitations on a litigant’s assertion of jus tertii \n \nare not constitutionally mandated....”); Latin Am. Music Co. v. Archdiocese, 499 F.3d 32, 46 (1st Cir.2007) (“A question of who \nmay assert an otherwise justiciable claim is a question of prudential standing that does not implicate the court’s jurisdiction.” \n(citation omitted)). Nevertheless, third-party standing is the sort of “threshold question” that this court may resolve before \naddressing jurisdiction. Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 6 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 1230, 161 L.Ed.2d 82 (2005) (citations omitted); see also \nKowalski v.

But see General Inv. Co. v. N.Y. C.R. Co., 271 U.S. 228, 230–31, 46 \nS.Ct. 496, 70 L.Ed. 920 (1926) (“There may be jurisdiction and yet an absence of merits as where the plaintiff seeks preventive \nrelief against a threatened violation of law of which he has no right to complain, either because it will not injure him or because the \nright to invoke such relief is lodged exclusively in an agency charged with the duty of representing the public in the matter. \nWhether a plaintiff seeking such relief has the requisite standing is a question going to the merits, and its determination is an \nexercise of jurisdiction.” (citations omitted)). \n \n18  See Mem. Supp. Mot. SEIU Local 509 Intervene, Ex. A, 4–5 [# 284] (requesting compliance with the Disengagement Order and \npreventing Defendant from terminating HSCs). \n \n \n19  This court does not decide whether the Union has associational standing. See United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 116 (1st \nCir.1992) (explaining the three requirements for an association to sue on behalf of its members). \n \n \n20  Sua sponte consideration of third-party standing is in accord with Supreme Court decisions and the practices of other courts. See, \ne.g., Craig, 429 U.S. at 193–94, 97 S.Ct. 451 (1976) (holding that a party’s failure to invoke the third-party standing doctrine \n \nprovides a ground for but does not require a federal court to refuse consideration of the doctrine); Bellehumeur v.

The lack of standing \nhere is neither exactly statutory standing (like Blue Chip) nor Article III standing. \n \n \n30  See supra note 3 and accompanying text. \n \n  5 \n \n\n \n \n31  United States v.

See infra note 46 and accompanying text. This court construes the unambiguous language \naccording to its plain meaning, Servicios Comerciales Andinos, S.A. v. GE Del Caribe, 145 F.3d 463, 469 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting \nUnited States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Selman, 70 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir.1995)), and the provisions of the Order are interpreted \nconsistently with the entire Order, Int’l Union v.

See Aiken v. City of \n \nMemphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1168 (6th Cir.1994) (intended beneficiaries lack standing to enforce consent decrees). But see Hook v. \nAriz.

There is, moreover, an indication of neither an agreement among the Parties about the Union’s benefit \n \nnor any circumstances that Defendants intended to give the Union the benefit of Defendants’ promised performance. See Amerifirst \nBank v. TJX Cos. Inc. (In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig.), 564 F.3d 489, 499 (1st Cir.2009) (“Unless otherwise agreed \nbetween promisor and promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in \nthe beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and ... the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to \ngive the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302 (1981))). \n \n37  See, e.g., United Seniors Ass’n v. Philip Morris USA, 500 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (“A federal court is required to determine \nwhether Article III jurisdiction exists prior to proceeding to the merits of the case.” (citations omitted)); Parella v. Ret. Bd. of the \n \nR.I. Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir.1999) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, \n140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)) (explaining how questions of Article III jurisdiction, but not necessarily those of statutory jurisdiction, \nshould be decided before the merits). The First Circuit has referred to this court’s “jurisdiction” and “authority” in the Ricci cases \nwithout specifying what type of jurisdiction was at issue. Patrick, 544 F.3d at 12, 17. As a starting point, this court assumes that \nthe First Circuit used the terms “jurisdiction” and “authority” to refer to this court’s subject-matter jurisdiction (or the lack thereof). \nSee Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, ––– U.S. ––––, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 1244, 176 L.Ed.2d 17 (2010) (explaining that “jurisdiction” \nrefers to a court’s “adjudicatory authority”); Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (explaining that “subject-matter jurisdiction” \nrefers to “the courts’ statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case”); Omnipoint Holdings v. City of Cranston, 586 F.3d \n38, 45 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009) (“ ‘Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label ‘jurisdictional’ not for claim-\nprocessing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal \njurisdiction) falling within a court’s adjudicatory authority.’ ” (quoting Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 454–55, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 \nL.Ed.2d 867 (2004))). That being said, exactly what sort of subject-matter jurisdiction is at issue is neither summarily discernible \nnor dispositive here. The subject-matter jurisdiction could be Article III jurisdiction, statutory jurisdiction, or perhaps another type \nof jurisdiction, such as the “kind of jurisdictional issue that Steel Co. directs must be resolved before addressing the merits of a \nclaim.” Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 6 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 1230, 161 L.Ed.2d 82 (2005) (explaining that a court may also dispose of a case \non a different threshold ground). That is, whatever the answer, this court should (or at least may) consider this jurisdictional issue \nbefore considering the Union’s Motion on its merits. \n \n38  Int’l Paper v. Town of Jay, Me., 887 F.2d 338, 346 (1st Cir.1989) (“[P]ermissive intervention ordinarily must be supported by \nindependent jurisdictional grounds” (quotations and citations omitted)). \n \n \n39  Johansen v. United States, 506 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir.2007) (citations and quotations omitted) (reviewing a district court’s conclusion \non a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction). \n \n \n40  See Mem. Supp. Mot. SEIU Local 509 Intervene, Ex. A, [# 284] (attaching proposed complaint); Int’l Paper v. Town of Jay, Me., \n124 F.R.D. 506, 510 (D.Me.1989) (looking to jurisdictional bases claimed in the amended complaint where a motion for \n \npermissive intervention did not proffer any jurisdictional bases); cf. Johansen, 506 F.3d at 68 (“[I]t is black-letter law that \njurisdiction must be apparent from the face of the plaintiff’s pleading.” (quoting PCS 2000 LP v. Romulus Telecomms., 148 F.3d \n  6 \n \n\n \n32, 35 (1st Cir.1998))). \n \n41  544 F.3d at 8. \n \n \n42  See Mem. Supp. Mot. SEIU Local 509 Intervene, Ex. A, 2 [# 284]. The Union (correctly) does not argue that there is diversity \njurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Moreover, there is no federal question jurisdiction because the Union’s proposed complaint \n \nmakes no mention of any federal law or constitutional provision that Defendants allegedly violated. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; cf. R.I. \nFed’n of Teachers v. Norberg, 630 F.2d 850, 854–55 (1st Cir.1980) (“[I]ntervention under Rule 24 is conditioned by the Rule \n24(c) requirement that the intervenor state a well-pleaded claim or defense to the action.”). \n \n43  See Patrick, 544 F.3d at 12, 17. \n \n \n44  Id. at 13. There may be, in some instances, other grounds upon which this court may assert jurisdiction. Id. at 20–22. The Union \ndoes not address any of those grounds and this court similarly does not discuss those apparently inapplicable arguments. \n \n \n45  Ricci, 823 F.Supp. at 988. \n \n \n46  This court’s reading of the Disengagement Order, as a consent decree, is guided by principles of contract interpretation. See \nPatrick, 544 F.3d at 17 (“The terms of the consent decree embodied in the Disengagement Order [are] like any contract \n \nconstruction issue ....”); cf. Navarro–Ayala v. Hernandez–Colon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1338–40 (1st Cir.1991) (using ordinary principles \nof contract interpretation for a consent decree where the issue involved determining the scope of the parties’ original bargain). \n \n47  Because the Disengagement Order mentions only that Plaintiffs may bring such an action, it is reasonable to read the \nDisengagement Order as not allowing anyone else to bring such an action. See, e.g., Cicirello v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 123 F.R.D. 523, 526 \n \n(E.D.Pa.1989) (finding that because a consent decree vested the right to enforce the decree in one party, other, non-enumerated \nparties lacked standing to bring enforcement actions); cf. Institut Pasteur v. Cambridge Biotech Corp., 104 F.3d 489, 495 (1st \nCir.1997) (“The doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius instructs that when certain matters are mentioned in a contract, \nother similar matters not mentioned were intended to be excluded.” (citation omitted)). The Union, moreover, does not argue for a \ncontrary interpretation of paragraph 7. \n \n48  See, e.g., Godin v. Schencks, 629 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.2010) (“ ‘[A] court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its subject \nmatter jurisdiction, and to proceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.’ ” (quoting In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, \n \n1002 (1st Cir.1988))); see also supra note 37. But see Iglesias v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 156 F.3d 237, 243 (1st Cir.1998) (providing \na non-binding discussion on the merits despite finding an apparent lack of subject-matter jurisdiction), abrogated on other grounds \nby Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Eng. Inc., 603 F.3d 71, 86 n. 18 (1st Cir.2010). Two concluding notes are in order. First, this \ncourt’s two other holdings regarding standing, see supra Sections III.A and III.B, are not considerations of the merits of the \nUnion’s Motion but are threshold questions. See supra note 17 and accompanying text. This court’s decision, therefore, is faithful \nto Steel Co.’s ban on the practice of hypothetical jurisdiction. See supra note 37 and accompanying text. Second, the two other \nholdings are independent of this court’s conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction. Admittedly, two of the holdings—this court’s lack of \njurisdiction and the Union’s absence of standing under the Disengagement Order—are rooted in the same operative document: the \nDisengagement Order. But the two holdings are independent from one another because they are animated by separate legal \nprinciples. The Union’s absence of standing under the Disengagement Order is a direct result of the rule in Blue Chip, 421 U.S. at \n750, 95 S.Ct. 1917, whereas this court’s lack of jurisdiction is based upon the First Circuit’s Ricci v. Patrick decision, 544 F.3d at \n8, 11. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  7 \n ",

U.S. Atty., Justice Dept.,\nBoston, Mass., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nTAURO, District Judge.\nA class action was filed in 1972, on behalf of the mentally retarded residents of Belchertown State School,\nasserting that conditions there were so inadequate that they violated the residents' constitutional and statutory\nrights. During the next three years, similar actions were filed on behalf of residents of Fernald, Monson,\nWrentham and Dever State Schools. Named as defendants were several Massachusetts officials with direct and\nindirect responsibility for these institutions.\nI inspected these institutions and learned first hand that conditions at each of them were deplorable and\nintolerable. That impression was conveyed to the defendants who, thereafter, agreed to work with plaintiffs and\nthe court in an effort to fashion a series of consent decrees that would remedy the unacceptable conditions under\nwhich our mentally retarded citizens were existing. Those decrees were finalized and issued by this court in\n[1]\n1977. Much has been accomplished since then.\nThanks to the enlightened leadership of Governor Dukakis00the determined and even-handed oversight of\n97\nAttorney General Bellotti00the concerted efforts of state and federal officials00the tireless devotion of the parents,\n97 97\nfriends and legal counsel of the retarded00the invaluable cooperation of the Children's Hospital Medical Center00\n97 97\nthe support and responsiveness of our state legislature00the diligence and patience of our three Court Monitors,\n97\nSteven Horowitz, Anne Berry and Tom Wachtell00and the truly noble dedication of the professional staffs who\n97\nprovide daily care at these schools00it is now clear that we have significantly improved the quality of life for the\n97\nretarded.\nThe filth, squalor and unsafe conditions that once characterized these institutions no longer exist. Instead, major\ncapital projects at each of them have been completed or are in progress. Staffing levels have been dramatically\n380 increased, thereby providing truly professional supervision, as well as habilitative opportunities. In addition, *380\na responsive program of community placement has been undertaken.\nOf course, these schools are still far from perfect. More work remains to be done. But, given the demonstrated\ngood faith of all concerned, I am confident that I no longer need to actively oversee compliance with these\ndecrees. I have, therefore, fashioned the attached order that will serve as the agenda for their full\nimplementation, under the supervision of an Office of Quality Assurance, to be established within the Governor's\noffice by his Executive Order.\nI take this step of disengagement with confidence that our retarded citizens will never again live under the\nconditions of a decade ago.\n\n* * * * * *\nThe essential concepts covered by the accompanying order are summarized below.\n1. ONGOING SERVICE PROVISION.\n[2]\nThe defendants are ordered to continue to provide services and housing to all class members , and to maintain\nfacilities and equipment, in accordance with the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and the consent\ndecrees. Notwithstanding the stylistic differences of the various decrees, the overriding substantive principles\nguiding the court's supervision of each institution have been the same00the standards of care articulated in Title\n97\nXIX and in the Capital Community Plan. The defendants are required to continue their adherence to those\nstandards.\n2. OFFICE OF QUALITY ASSURANCE.\nAt a hearing on March 3, 1986, I informed the parties that, as a condition of my disengagement from these cases,\nan independent quality assurance oversight process would have to be established. To this end, the court directs\nthat there be established the Office of Quality Assurance (Office). The Office shall be maintained by the\nCommonwealth for a three year period, to commence on the date of this court's disengagement. The role of the\nOffice is to monitor the quality of care provided to class members, so as to ensure continued compliance with the\nvarious orders of this court.\nThe Office is to be established by the transfer of the current Court Monitor's Office to the supervision of the\nGovernor. The Director of the Office shall be Tom Wachtell, the present Court Monitor. The Office shall be funded\nin accordance with the budget contained in Appendix A of the accompanying order. An Advisory Panel to the\nOffice shall be established, as specified in Appendix A.\n3. PERSONNEL.\nRequired staffing levels and patterns at the various institutions have been established by the Personnel Decree.\nThe court recognizes that these staffing levels and patterns must be sufficiently flexible to meet changing needs.\nTo that end, and in order to ensure proper care for all class members, a process must exist for determining the\nadequacy of staffing patterns, both at the institutions and in community settings. The defendants have developed\nsuch a process, with the valuable guidance of the Department of Health and Human Services. That process was\nsubstantially accepted and made an order of the court on August 18, 1986.\n4. PROJECTS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION.\n381 Notwithstanding the substantial progress that has been made, there are a *381 number of matters that must be\nresolved in order to ensure that full compliance is achieved and maintained. These items are delineated in\nAppendix B of the accompanying order. In addition, it is essential that there exist sufficient safeguards and\nmechanisms to ensure that class members continue to receive the services to which they are entitled. The\ndefendants have committed themselves to establishing and maintaining such safeguards and mechanisms, and\nthese too are identified in Appendix B. It shall be the Director's responsibility to monitor the defendants' progress,\nso as to ensure full compliance without unnecessary delay.\nORDER\nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n1. The defendants shall continue to provide services to all class members, as that term is defined in note 2 of the\naccompanying memorandum, and to maintain facilities and equipment, in accordance with the standards and\nrequirements of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and the consent decrees. All service provision requirements of\nthe decrees remain in force, as do those provisions requiring Individual Service Plans and the utilization of\nevaluation and monitoring mechanisms.\n2. An Office of Quality Assurance shall be established by an Executive Order of the Governor, in terms consistent\nwith the provisions of Appendix A, attached hereto.\n3. The defendants shall maintain personnel levels at the various institutions in accordance with the Personnel\nDecree and this court's modification order of April 21, 1982. In the event that changes in personnel levels are\nrequired, either as a result of community placement or increased resident need, such changes shall be\ndetermined and carried out in accordance with this court's memoranda and orders of February 28, 1986, and\nAugust 18, 1986.\n4. The defendants shall comply fully with all requirements identified in Appendix B, attached hereto, and shall\nreport semi-annually on their progress to the Director of the Office of Quality Assurance (Director) and to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n5. During the three years following this court's disengagement, the parties and the Director may seek this court's\ncounsel or clarification as to its orders. Ninety (90) days prior to the end of this three year period, the court shall\nhold a hearing to review implementation of this final order.\n6. All defendant filing requirements with the court, except as specified in this order, are hereby suspended.\n7. This court's disengagement shall take effect upon the issuance by the Governor of an Executive Order\nestablishing the Office of Quality Assurance, as described in Appendix A.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX A\nOFFICE OF QUALITY ASSURANCE\nINTRODUCTION\nTo safeguard the health, safety and well-being of class members, the Office of Quality Assurance (Office) shall be\ncreated. This Office shall ensure that all class members receive the services to which they are entitled under the\nconsent decrees, and that the Commonwealth comply with all federal and state laws, rules, regulations and\nstandards that are applicable to these class members. Such Office shall be within the state government, report\ndirectly to the Governor, and be initially chartered for a three year term. Establishment of the Office shall occur\nthrough the transfer of the Court Monitor's Office in its entirety, the appointment of the current Court Monitor, Tom\nWachtell, as its Director, and the creation of an Advisory Panel in accordance with the membership requirements\nincluded herein. The Office shall function as an independent oversight body within state government.\n382 The Office shall fulfill the duties and functions described herein and shall monitor *382 the implementation of any\nand all outstanding consent decree requirements, agreements among the parties, commitments made by the\nCommonwealth and applicable rulings of the court, including but not limited to its final disengagement orders.\nThe Director shall report to the Governor on the quality of care provided to all class members and on the status of\nthe protection of their rights under the consent decrees and applicable federal and state laws and regulations. For\nthe purpose of meeting his responsibilities, the Director shall have reasonable access to the Governor and the\nability to communicate promptly and regularly with him.\n\nSix months prior to the end of the Office's three year term, the Director, after consultation with the Advisory Panel,\nshall make a recommendation to the Governor as to whether the continued existence of the Office is advisable or\nnecessary to assure quality of services and protection of rights. The Director shall also transmit copies of his\nrecommendations to the court and the plaintiffs' counsel.\nAny successor to the first appointed Director shall be appointed by the Governor. The Director shall have full\nknowledge of the consent decrees, the state's mental retardation service system and agencies delivering such\nservice, and have demonstrated experience in administration and quality assurance. Notice of such successor's\nappointment, including curriculum vitae, shall be provided to the court and the plaintiffs' counsel.\nSTAFFING AND RESOURCES\nAdequate resources will be made available to fund the Office in accordance with the budget included herein. The\nDirector shall, in accordance with state rules and regulations, select the staff of the Office, define staff\nresponsibilities, and establish appropriate compensation levels for all employees. The Director, after consultation\nwith the Advisory Panel, shall annually recommend to the Governor any proposed modifications to the Office\nbudget.\nCOOPERATION FROM STATE AGENCIES\nA number of agencies, including but not limited to the Departments of Mental Health, Public Health, Public\nWelfare, and Social Services, the Executive Office of Communities and Development, the Division of Capital\nPlanning and Operations, the Rate Setting Commission, the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, and the\nMassachusetts Commission for the Blind, conduct activities and programs having a direct impact on the quality of\ncare to class members.

The Secretary's mandate\n[3]\nwas to advise this court whether current conditions at the institutions met standards imposed by Title XIX,  and\nagreed to by the parties in consent decrees approved by this court on July 25, 1977.\nOn October 31, 1983, the Secretary filed a report discussing conditions at each institution, as well as her\nconclusions with respect to Title XIX and consent decree compliance. All other parties have now filed responses\n[4]\nto the Secretary's report.\nSecretary Heckler's report is comprehensive, thorough and professional. In summarizing its essence she stated\nthat\n\nThe facts are alarming ... at every single institution there were substantive gaps between the\npromise of improvement and the reality of compliance with existing safety standards which are\nnecessary to protect the residents ... some of the buildings are so far below minimally acceptable\n[5]\nstandards that I must now confront the issue of decertification.\nUnderscoring \"the urgency of the institutions' needs and the necessity of a response to the problem\" by the\nMassachusetts legislature, Secretary Heckler went on to state:\nThe issue has been recognized and has festered without resolution for too long. For over a\ndecade, the Commonwealth has been on notice that thousands of children, women and men in\nthese five Massachusetts institutions were being shortchanged. I serve as both their guardian and\n[6]\ntheir advocate. I cannot and will not ignore their needs.\nSecretary Heckler concluded her remarks by targeting accurately those whose responsibility it is to remedy the\nsubstandard conditions that have plagued these institutions for years.\nThe time for patience by the federal government 00 postponement and procrastination by the\n97\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts 00 is past. I again urge the Massachusetts House and Senate to\n97\nmake the mentally handicapped ... an immediate priority by promptly adopting a capital outlay\n[7]\nbudget which provides the funds to correct these long standing inequities.\nThis court stayed any action on Secretary Heckler's reports in order to give Governor Dukakis and the legislature\nan opportunity to formulate and implement a meaningful and effective remedial program. For his part, the\nGovernor acted responsibly by requesting an 80 million dollar capital budget to meet the deficiencies detailed in\nSecretary Heckler's report. Speaker McGee and the House of Representatives acted with similar responsibility by\napproving the Governor's budget request, essentially as submitted.\nThat pattern of responsible action was shattered on December 7, 1983 by the Senate Ways and Means\nCommittee which cut the Governor's request by approximately twenty-five percent. The rationale offered by\nSenate Ways and Means Chairman Atkins for the budget cut was reported as being\n417 *417 If we build the beds ... to satisfy the court, there will be nobody to occupy those beds.[8]\nHowever credible Senator Atkins' remarks may sound to the uninitiated, they are readily recognized by those\nfamiliar with the history of this litigation as being merely another example of the \"postponement and\nprocrastination\" that was so aptly recognized and criticized by Secretary Heckler.\nSenator Atkins is apparently misinformed when he suggests that the Governor's budget request was merely an\neffort \"to satisfy the court.\" After all these years, Senator Atkins should know that the renovations called for in the\nGovernor's budget request are not the whim of the federal court. To the contrary, the Governor's budget request\nwas for renovations that are required by Title XIX standards, if the Commonwealth is to continue to be eligible for\nthe millions of dollars it receives annually in federal matching funds.\nThe consent decrees entered by this court six years ago were negotiated and drafted by the parties themselves\nafter inspection tours of these institutions established that they were little more than \"pig pens\" and \"human\n[9]\nwarehouses.\"  Governor Dukakis and Attorney General Bellotti, to their great credit, refused to defend the\nindefensible. Rather, they undertook the enlightened mission of working with the plaintiffs and this court to\nfashion necessary remedial programs for each institution.\nHundreds of hours were dedicated to the task. The need for capital renovation was studied and agreed upon by\nthe parties 00 building by building, room by room. Staffing increases were carefully analyzed on a position by\n97\nposition basis. Essentially, the standards relied upon by the parties, and then memorialized by the consent\ndecrees, were those of Title XIX 00 standards that the Commonwealth was already obligated to meet in order to\n97\ninsure the continuing annual flow of federal matching dollars.\n\nMoreover, the decrees were crafted with great flexibility. They permitted the Commonwealth to avoid any\nrenovation made unnecessary by placement of residents in community programs. Construction planning\ndeadlines were set with more than sufficient lead time to allow cancellation, should community placement\nbecome a reality rather than a promise. At almost every status conference held by this court during the past six\nyears, plans for community placement were represented by Department of Mental Health (DMH) officials as\nbeing well on the way to implementation. This court encouraged those plans and stated repeatedly that it had no\npreference as to where the retarded were cared for 00 community or institution. The court's only concern was that\n97\nthe care be proper and adequate to meet the human rights of affected retarded citizens.\nIt is a matter of record that this court has granted dozens of extensions to the Commonwealth's renovation\nschedule in order to give DMH officials an opportunity to get a comprehensive community program from the\n[10]\nplanning table to the field.  Nevertheless, time after time, extended target dates for community placement\nwere simply not met, thereby triggering the renovation schedules at the various institutions.\nAnd so, any claim that renovations at the various institutions are being made at the expense of community\nplacement is pure fiction. The basic reason why there is no comprehensive program for those who would benefit\nfrom community placement is that the legislature has seen fit not to fund such an effort. Any claim that funding of\ncommunity placement would have required a duplicative expenditure of public funds is made by those who either\nhave not read or do not understand Title XIX standards and the applicable terms of the consent decrees. The fact\n418 is that there should have been both community and institutional *418 programs for the retarded. Title XIX and the\nconsent decrees permit such an approach.\nOf course, improperly fostering hostility and competition between advocates of community and institutional care\ncan be an effective, though transparent, diversionary tactic for those who really wish to do as little as possible for\nthe retarded.\nThe legislature has now recessed for a Christmas holiday without providing any funds to rectify the deficiencies\nthat Secretary Heckler termed \"alarming.\" It is manifestly unfair to defer the constitutional rights of those who\nmust live at these institutions until public officials charged with responsibility for their care decide to abandon an\n[11]\napparent policy of \"postponement and procrastination.\"  Certainly, it would be unconscionable for this court to\npermit such a policy of postponement and procrastination to be further subsidized by federal tax dollars.\nThis court has stated in the past\nThe retarded have no potent political constituency. They must rely on the good will of those of us\nmore fortunate than they, and the Constitution which controls the manner in which all of us must\n[12]\nmeet our varied responsibilities.\nIt is now clear that Secretary Heckler must be permitted to meet her Constitutional responsibilities to the retarded\n[13]\nand \"to serve as both their guardian and their advocate.\"  To this end, the court lifts any and all stays entered\nin these cases, grants the Secretary's Motion for a Protective Order, and authorizes her to confront the issues of\ndecertification and the appropriate withholding of federal matching funds.\n                             APPENDIX 1\n     EXHIBIT A     9/15/83    Belchertown Plaintiffs' Response to the Court Order\n                              of September 7, 1983, Relative to Noncompliance of\n                              Buildings E, F, G and Infirmary with Title XIX and\n                              the Consent Decree.\n     EXHIBIT B     9/21/83    Defendants' Statement of Position Concerning Buildings\n                              E, F, G and Infirmary at Belchertown State\n                              School.\n\n     EXHIBIT C    10/05/83    Plaintiffs' Responses to the Defendants' (9/21/83)\n                              Statement of Position Concerning Buildings E, F, G\n                              and Infirmary at the Belchertown State School.\n     EXHIBIT D    10/31/83    Fernald and Monson Plaintiffs' Responses to the Court\n                              Order of September 7, 1983.\n     EXHIBIT E    10/31/83    Dever and Wrentham Plaintiffs' Statement of Position\n                              Concerning Compliance with the Consent Decrees\n                              and Title XIX.\n     EXHIBIT F    10/31/83    Defendants' Statements of Position Concerning\n                              Fernald State School and Monson Developmental\n                              Center.\n     EXHIBIT G    10/31/83    Secretary of the Department of Health and Human\n                              Services Statement of Position (concerning the\n                              compliance of 5 Massachusetts Intermediate Care\n                              Facilities for the Mentally Retarded with Title XIX\n                              standards and the consent decrees).\n     EXHIBIT H    11/01/83    Defendants' Statement of Position Concerning Certain\n                              Buildings at Wrentham and Dever State Schools.\n     EXHIBIT I    11/14/83    Response of the Secretary of Health and Human\n                              Services to Defendants' Statement of Position at the\n                              State Schools.\n419 *419\n     EXHIBIT J    11/21/83    Defendants' Response to the Statement of Position of\n                              the Secretary of the Department of Health and\n                              Human Services.\n     EXHIBIT K    11/21/83    Defendants' Response to Monson Plaintiffs' Statement\n                              of Position.\n     EXHIBIT L    11/21/83    Defendants' Response to the Dever and Wrentham\n                              Plaintiffs' Statement of Position Concerning Compliance\n                              with the Consent Decrees and Title XIX.\n     EXHIBIT M    11/21/83    Defendants' Response to the Fernald Plaintiffs'\n                              Statement of Position.\nAPPENDIX 2\nWASHINGTON, D.C.00Secretary Margaret M. Heckler has, late today, filed with the Federal District Court of\n97\nMassachusetts (Judge Joseph Tauro) the results of the intensive, on-site survey and investigation which the\nfederal Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) health, mental retardation and fire safety experts have\ncompleted at the five Massachusetts State Schools for the Mentally Retarded (Belchertown, Dever, Fernald,\nMonson and Wrentham). For over a decade, these institutions have been under federal court orders to come into\nconformity with federal and state standards.\n\n\"The facts are alarming,\" said Secretary Heckler. \"Our survey found that in certain buildings at every single\ninstitution there were substantive gaps between the promise of improvement and the reality of compliance with\nexisting safety standards which are necessary to protect the residents.\"\n\"Some of the shortcomings can be remedied in a matter of months with funds already appropriated by the\nLegislature. The money that Massachusetts has previously put into the pipeline will bring about conformity in\nthose cases. But some of the buildings are so far below minimally acceptable standards that I must now confront\nthe issue of decertification.\"\n\"When I visited the Fernald school in Waltham in July, I stated as simply as possible the urgency of the\ninstitutions' needs and the necessity of a response to the problem by the members of the Massachusetts General\nCourt. The issue has been recognized and has festered without resolution for too long. For over a decade, the\nCommonwealth has been on notice that thousands of children, women and men in these five Massachusetts\ninstitutions were being shortchanged. I serve as both their guardian and their advocate. I cannot and will not\n420 ignore their needs. The time for *420 patience by the federal government 00 postponement and procrastination by\n97\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts 00 is past.\"\n97\n\"I again urge the Massachusetts House and Senate to make the mentally handicapped residents of Belchertown,\nDever, Fernald, Monson and Wrentham State schools an immediate priority by promptly adopting a capital outlay\nbudget which provides the funds to correct these long-standing inequities.\" Mrs. Heckler concluded.\n[1] By order of this court, the Secretary was made party to this litigation on May 18, 1983. See Ricci v. Callahan,\n97 F.R.D. 737 (D.Mass.1983).\n[2] This litigation is now in its second decade. Its procedural history is summarized in prior opinions.

The motion contained similar allegations and was \npremised on similar grounds. \n \n \n6  Even if the district court did have authority, the Commonwealth argues, the August 2007 order was improper because: (1) it \nexceeded the bounds of the 1993 Disengagement Order; (2) it improperly issued a mandatory injunction when neither federal law \n \nnor the Disengagement Order had been violated; and (3) it effectively mandated that the Commonwealth keep Fernald open \nindefinitely, which is beyond the power of a federal court. We do not reach those arguments. \n \n7  The plaintiffs argue that the court’s conclusion that it had authority to reopen can also be justified as an exercise of its “ancillary \njurisdiction” or “inherent jurisdiction.” We discuss this argument later. \n \n \n8  In 1993, years before it issued the August 2007 order, the district court recognized the Disengagement Order did not prohibit the \nclosing of any facility. Ricci III, 823 F.Supp. at 987 (“[N]othing in this Order is intended to detract from or limit the discretion of \n \nthe defendants in ... allocating its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens.”). It also acknowledged in 1992 that DMR \ncould close any facility. See Ricci v. Okin (Ricci II ), 781 F.Supp. 826, 827-28 (D.Mass.1992) (“The court is not opposed to the \neventual closing of Dever or any other [pre-1993] Consent Decree facility.”); see also Ricci IV, 499 F.Supp.2d at 92 n. 17 (“The \ncourt maintains [the position articulated in 1992].”). \n \n9  Plaintiff Wrentham Association argues that the record shows there was intimidation of residents. Neither the district court nor the \nmonitor found any intimidation during the relevant period and the record does not sustain the accusation. \n \n \n10  We do not need to reach the preliminary question of whether the modification doctrine can apply at all when the parties have in a \nconsent decree defined the conditions for reopening. \n \n \n11  Amici, Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc. and Voice of the Retarded, Inc., filed a brief in \nthis  court  in  support  of  appellees  that  argues  to  the  contrary  that  the  core  holding  of  Olmstead  does  not  endorse \n \ndeinstitutionalization but requires an individualized assessment that considers “the views of treatment professionals; the views of \nthe affected individual; and state resources.” Amici, the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of Massachusetts and \nothers, filed a brief in support of appellants. They argue that there has been a paradigm shift throughout the nation in favor of \ndeinstitutionalization. \nWe note but have no need to address these different views. \n \n12  The Wrentham Association argues that, in addition to its inherent authority, the district court explicitly retained jurisdiction here. \nAny jurisdiction retained in the Disengagement Order, however, could be activated only after certain conditions precedent, such as \n \na showing of a systemic failure of the ISP process, were met. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  10 \n ",

See, e.g., Ricci v. \nOkin, 978 F.2d 764, 767 (1st Cir.1992) (Breyer, J.) (“[W]e add that it would not likely benefit the appellants to obtain jurisdiction, \n \nfor the practical, common sense considerations we have mentioned would balance heavily in favor of permitting a six-month \nprocedurally-necessitated extension of the October 1986 Order’s life.”). \n \n2  Ricci v. Okin, 823 F.Supp. 984, 987 (D.Mass.1993). “ISP” stands for Individual Service Plan. Id. \n \n \n3  Id. at 988. \n \n \n4  The Court Monitor visited DMR intermediate care facilities and community residences throughout the Commonwealth, surveyed \nday programs, hired independent medical experts, scoured the medical and departmental records of the transferred individuals, and \n \nmet with officials, guardians, and residents. See generally, The Monitor’s Report, Paper # 158 (March 6, 2007). \n \n5  Id. at 14. \n  2 \n \n\n \n   \n6  Id. at 27. \n \n \n7  These views of the facilities in question are admissible evidence in this circuit. United States v. Gray, 199 F.3d 547, 550 (1st \nCir.1999). \n \n \n8  That the Commonwealth has such a plan is a fact established in the record and acknowledged by the DMR. See The Department of \nMental Retardation’s Response To: (1) the Report of United States Attorney Michael J. Sullivan; and (2) the Court’s Order Show \n \nCause Why an Injunction Should Not Enter, Paper # 198, p. 6 (May 31, 2007) (“On February 23, 2003, Governor Romney \nannounced plans to close the FDC.”). \n \n9  The Monitor’s Report, Paper # 158, p. 24. \n \n \n10  Id. \n \n \n11  See e.g., 115 Mass.Code Regs. 6.20(3)(a)(3) (2007). \n \n \n12  See Ricci v. Okin, 781 F.Supp. 826, 827, n. 4 (D.Mass.1992) (describing the ISP process and explaining that “[r]ecommendation[s] \nas to residential and program placement are based on evaluation of the actual needs of the resident or client rather than on what \n \nfacilities and programs are currently available”). \n \n13  The Final Order does not define “systemic.” As this court oversaw entry of the Final Order, it is uniquely competent to declare that \n“systemic” simply was intended to have its plain dictionary meaning-“of or relating to a system.” Webster’s II New College \n \nDictionary 1120 (2001). Accordingly, a systemic failure need not be catastrophic in and of itself. Rather, it may simply be a \nproblem of any magnitude, which manifests itself on a system-wide basis, across a number of ISP processes. \n \n14  A district court has jurisdiction to enforce an order where the court retained such jurisdiction when it closed the case. See Baella-\nSilva v. Hulsey, 454 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2006). This court did explicitly retain such jurisdiction in the Final Order. Ricci, 823 \n \nF.Supp. at 988. \n \n15  See Show Cause Order, Paper # 181 (May 9, 2007). \n \n \n16  The DMR asserts that entering such an order would run afoul of the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. \n581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). There, the Court held that transfer out of a state institution and to a community \n \nsetting “is in order when the State’s treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer \nfrom institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” Id. at 587, \n119 S.Ct. 2176 (emphasis added). But this court is not precluding such a transfer. To the contrary, this court is simply ensuring that \nthe DMR use the ISP process to adequately assess whether the setting is appropriate and whether it “is not opposed by the affected \nindividual.” \n \n17  As the DMR notes, the Consent Decrees entered by this court prior to the Final Order contemplate facility closure. See Ricci, 781 \nF.Supp. at 830 (“The Consent Decrees do not prohibit the possible closing of any facility. Indeed, if residents are properly placed \n \ninto alternative settings, and a facility is no longer needed, this court will not interfere with its closure.”). The court maintains this \nposition. The purpose of today’s order is not to interfere with closure, but to make sure alternative placement decisions properly \nstart with the needs and wishes of the individual resident, rather than an inflexible global closure policy. \n \n18  The court would however, encourage the DMR and the Commonwealth to consider alternative proposals for Fernald, such as the \none put forward by the Court Monitor at p. 25-26 of his report, which could use the existing capacity and resources available at \n \nFernald to efficiently meet the needs of individuals, as well as the policy priorities of the Commonwealth, without causing the \ntrauma and “devastating effects” that could result from transfers. \n \n19  Ricci, 823 F.Supp. at 988 (“Individual ISP disputes shall be enforced solely through the state ISP process.”). \n \n \n20  Id. \n \n \n  3 \n ",

Cohen, Boston, Mass., were\non brief, for appellees.\nBefore BREYER, Chief Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and CYR, Circuit Judge.\nBREYER, Chief Judge.\nThis appeal arises out of a set of consolidated cases concerning the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' care and\neducation of its mentally retarded citizens. Plaintiffs first brought these cases against the state in the early 1970's.\nIn 1977 the district court entered a set of consent decrees, aimed at improving care conditions, and the court,\nduring the next several years, actively oversaw their implementation. By 1986, conditions had improved to the\npoint where, on October 9, 1986, the court entered an order (the \"October 1986 Order\") which, in the court's\nview, represented a \"step of disengagement.\" The Order required the state to create an Office of Quality\nAssurance (\"OQA\"), to monitor further compliance with the decrees, to assure mentally retarded persons of the\nservices to which the law entitled them, and to carry out various related responsibilities. It set forth a list of\nspecific \"tasks\" that the state was to accomplish. The October 1986 Order seemed to contemplate the court's\nfinal withdrawal from supervision of the consent decrees after three years, for it said that \"[d]uring the three years\nfollowing this court's disengagement, the parties and the [OQA] Director may seek this court's counsel or\nclarification as to its orders.\" It added that \"[n]inety (90) days prior to the end of this three year period, the court\nshall hold a hearing to review implementation of this final order.\" It said, in an Appendix, that the OQA was\n\"initially chartered for a three year term.\" And, in the opinion explaining the Order, the court said that the OQA\n765 \"shall be maintained by the Commonwealth for a three year period, to *765 commence on the date of this court's\ndisengagement.\"\nAs October 1989 approached, the parties agreed to extend the October 1986 Order. In September 1989, the\ncourt ordered that \"[a]ll provisions of the order and memorandum entered on October 9, 1986 ... shall remain in\neffect until June 30, 1990.\" Subsequently, with the parties' consent (with either both consenting, or with one\nconsenting and the other acquiescing), the court further extended its October 1986 Order 00 to September 30,\n97\n1990, then to December 31, 1990, then to March 31, 1991, then to June 30, 1991, then to September 30, 1991,\nthen to December 31, 1991, and, then to June 30, 1992.\nOn March 13, 1992, the state defendants moved for \"a hearing in June, 1992, or at the Court's convenience in\nthat period, `to review implementation'\" of the October 1986 Order. The district court asked the parties to file\nreports on the status of the state's compliance. On April 2 the court requested further detailed submissions,\nincluding a report from OQA; it set forth a timetable for those submissions; and, it said that after it had received\nthose submissions, it would schedule a further conference. The defendants protested that the court's request for\ndetailed submissions indicated that the court was imposing upon them new duties, not previously foreseen or\n\nagreed to; they asked the court for an interpretation of the October 1986 Order and various underlying consent\ndecrees. On April 24, the court responded that the \"defendants' recent filings indicate ... the likelihood, if not\ninevitability, of an evidentiary hearing....\" It added that the issues the defendants had raised would be decided\nafter the hearing and after the parties had \"an opportunity to state their respective positions in briefs and at oral\nargument.\"\nAbout six weeks later, in early June, the plaintiffs moved to \"extend all provisions of ... [the October 1986 Order],\nincluding an extension of the Office of Quality Assurance's term, up to and including December 31, 1992.\" On\nJune 24, 1992, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion, thereby extending the October 1986 Order for six\nmore months. The district court considered the request for extension \"reasonable,\" in light of the facts that\nplaintiffs were supposed to respond to the defendants' submissions by mid-July, that the OQA was to submit a\nreport by mid-August, and that the court, thereafter, would have \"to assess defendants' compliance....\"\nDefendants now appeal the district court's order of June 24, 1992, extending the October 1986 Order for six\nmonths (the \"June 1992 extension\"). They basically claim that the district court should have permitted the\nOctober 1986 Order to terminate because they had completed all the \"tasks,\" and fulfilled all the requirements,\nthat it contained 00 a claim that plaintiffs strongly dispute. Plaintiffs add that we should not decide whether the\n97\ndefendants have, or have not, fulfilled their obligations under the October 1986 Order because the district court\nhas not yet had the opportunity to determine the matter. They argue that we lack jurisdiction to hear this\ninterlocutory appeal.\nWe agree with the plaintiffs that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The June 1992 extension is not a \"final\"\norder within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291; nor does it fall within the statutory exceptions permitting appeals of\ncertain \"interlocutory\" orders. 28 U.S.C. § 1292. Common sense suggests that this court should withhold its\nreview until the district court enters an order on the merits, either accepting or rejecting defendants' claim of\ncompliance. Such a decision, coming after all the parties have submitted relevant materials to the district court,\nwould permit any subsequent appellate review to take place on a complete record, aided by the district court's\nown analysis and opinion. Moreover, the record indicates that the district court intends to consider the matter both\nthoroughly and expeditiously. Thus, the time needed to bring about a considered district court decision on the\nmerits is comparatively short, given the many years this important litigation has been before the judiciary; and the\n766 added burden upon the state, in maintaining the existence of the OQA for *766 six more months, is comparatively\nsmall. Cf. Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (§ 1292(a)\n(1) provides for interlocutory appellate review over an order denying an injunction, where plaintiff shows that\norder might have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence, and that order can be effectually challenged only\nby immediate appeal); Kartell v. Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., 687 F.2d 543, 551-52 (1st Cir.1982) (same).\nThe only significant legal question before us is whether, despite the dictates of common sense, we must hear this\nappeal on the grounds that the June 1992 extension falls within the literal terms of the jurisdictional statute\npermitting appeals from \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts ... continuing ... injunctions....\" 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1). The defendants argue that the June 1992 extension of the October 1986 Order is an \"interlocutory\norder\" that \"continu[es]\" an injunction. In our view, however, the June 1992 extension does not continue an\ninjunction that would have otherwise stood \"dissolved by lapse of the time fixed in the original order.\" Sierra Club\nv. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 213 (1st Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). A careful reading of the October 1986 Order\nindicates that the Order was not to expire automatically at a set time (initially set at three years) after its entry.\nRather, the Order says that the parties may \"seek\" the court's \"counsel\" during the set three years and that\n\"[n]inety (90) days prior to the end of this three year period, the court shall hold a hearing to review\nimplementation....\" One might say that the Order contemplates termination after the set time; one can add that it\nrequires the district court to plan a hearing to consider compliance three months prior to the expiration of the set\ntime; but one cannot fairly say that the Order, by its own terms, simply expires while the court is in the midst of\nthe very \"compliance determination\" proceedings that the Order contemplates. To the contrary, the decree,\ntechnically speaking, would seem to expire only after the court, proceeding with reasonable speed, has held the\nrequired hearing and found compliance. This interpretation draws support from the district court's own\ninterpretation of the October 1986 Order, when (in 1989) that court wrote:\n\nIn my order of October 9, 1986, I provided for a three year period during which defendants were to\ncomplete a number of projects affecting the various institutions covered by the underlying consent\ndecrees. The completion of these tasks was, and remains, a prerequisite to this court's\ndisengagement in these cases. Recognizing that it was uncertain as to whether all that remained\nto be done could be completed within the three year period, the October 9, 1986 order provided\nthat I would review the situation during the fall of 1989.\nWe concede that the October 1986 Order also says that the OQA will \"be initially chartered for a three year term\"\nand that the district court also said the OQA \"shall be maintained by the Commonwealth for a three year\nperiod....\" But we cannot read these words (the first found in the Order's Appendix; the second found in the\nOpinion, not the Order) as creating a kind of automatic termination in the midst of compliance proceedings and\n(as just explained) contrary to the Order's apparent intent.\nSince we cannot read the June 1992 extension as, technically speaking, \"continuing\" an injunction that would\nhave otherwise expired, we are legally free to consider the matter from a practical point of view. See Marsh, 907\nF.2d at 214 & n. 2. And the common sense considerations outlined above lead us to conclude that, as a practical\nmatter, the June 1992 extension represents a brief procedural delay, necessary for the district court to resolve\nproperly the substantive issues. That being so, it does not fall within the scope of 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1)'s\nlanguage giving us jurisdiction. Id. at 214-15 (refusing interlocutory appellate review over a district court order\nthat \"was a step in controlling the litigation before the trial court\" and did not continue an injunction \"in any\njurisdictionally significant respect\") (citation omitted). Consequently, we must dismiss this appeal.\n767 *767 Since the question of jurisdiction is a fairly close one, we add that it would not likely benefit the appellants to\nobtain jurisdiction, for the practical, common sense considerations we have mentioned would balance heavily in\nfavor of permitting a six-month procedurally-necessitated extension of the October 1986 Order's life. Cf. Planned\nParenthood League v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009, 1023 (1st Cir.1981) (issuance of preliminary injunction\ndepends upon balance of harms, equities, and public interest, as well as likelihood of success on the merits); \nChalk v. United States Dist. Court Cent. Dist., 840 F.2d 701, 704 (9th Cir.1988) (basic function of preliminary\ninjunction is to preserve status quo pending determination of action on merits).\nRegardless, for the jurisdictional reasons discussed, the appeal is\nDismissed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Tauro\nUnited States District Court \nJohn Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse\n1 Courthouse Way - Suite 2300\nBoston, MA 02210\nRe: The Monitor's Report on Whether the \"Past and Prospective\ntransfer processes employed by the Department of Mental\nRetardation were in compliance with Federal Law, State\nRegulations, as well as Orders of the Court.”  \nDear Judge Tauro: \nI am writing you in my capacity as Court appointed Monitor in the\nFernald matter.  Since the appointment in February, 2006, our\noffice has conducted extensive visits to all of the\nCommonwealth’s Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally\nRetarded (ICF/MR) within Massachusetts, including four visits to\nFernald, and visits to Hogan, Monson, Templeton, Wrentham and\nGlavin.  We have met with well over 250 guardians,  parents and\nsiblings at Fernald and other ICF/MRs, and have visited with and\nmet with most of the residents of these facilities during their\nday programs and in their residences.  In addition , we visited\nover 30 community residences and numerous day centers.  We have\nalso reviewed all of the pleadings in the Ricci v. Okin, et. al.\nfilings,and ascertained that there are approximately 3,959 Ricci\nclass members.  Overall, 49 individuals were transferred from\nFernald since February 26, 2003 with 35 transferring to ICF/MRs\nand 14 transferring to community residences.  \nWhile our review touched on a number of issues raised by\nplaintiffs and guardians, two areas of significant concern were\ndelivery of medical services and the potential for greater abuse\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 2 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 2\nand neglect in the community.\nTo best understand how medical services are provided for\nindividuals residing in community residences, and how\ninvestigations of alleged neglect and abuse are conducted, our\noffice received two presentations from the Department of Mental\nRetardation (DMR) on Medical Services to Ricci Class Members in\nthe community, and how Allegations of Abuse and Neglect are\nInvestigated by DMR.  Our office invited all of the plaintiffs’\ncounsel to attend the presentations, and thereafter, solicited\nwritten comments and questions from plaintiffs’ counsel.  Upon\nreceipt of the plaintiffs’ comments and questions, our office\nasked DMR to respond in writing.  These presentations, and the\nfollow-up questions and answers, gave our office tremendous\ninsight into how medical services are accessed by mentally\nretarded individuals in community residences.  The presentation\non how Allegations of Abuse and Neglect are Investigated was\nextremely informative.  We also independently reviewed the\nDisabled Persons Protection Commissions Vendor Survey Reports for\nall ICF/MRs and for community residences since January, 1996.  We\nmet on a number of occasions with counsel for the parties and\nconducted bi-weekly conference calls.  We requested and were\nprovided assistance from counsel and the parties to better\nappreciate the issues, challenges and successes as it related to\nthe services provided to our most vulnerable citizens.  Overall,\nthe review by the Monitor attempted to meet the scope of review\ndefined by the Court.  Our approach was to achieve a full\nunderstanding of the various arguments and allegations being\nraised by the plaintiffs, in order to provide the Court with a\nmore comprehensive report.  \n  \n1. Overview of the Intermediate Care Facilities for the \nMentally Retarded (ICF/MRs)  \nA. The Hogan Regional Center\nOur office visited the Hogan Regional Center at 450 Maple Street,\nHathorne, Massachusetts.  Our office was extremely impressed with\nthe facility and the level of comprehensive medical care that is\nprovided to each individual.  The facility has an extremely\nfunctional design and is situated on 54 acres.  The facility was\nopened in 1967 and is presently home to approximately 151\nindividuals and has a capacity for 166 individuals.  The physical\nlayout consists of several discrete residential units and\nvocational work sites with a central gymnasium, pool, cafeteria,\nauditorium and motor training area.  The facility is Title XIX\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 3 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 3\nqualified and is capable of providing service coordination\ndependent upon an individuals assessed needs.  These needs could\ninclude the following: Assistive Technology, Audiology, Dental,\nMedicine, Neurology, Nursing, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy,\nOrthotics, Orthopedics, Peripatology, Physical Therapy,\nPsychology, Social Services, Speech Therapy, Therapeutic\nRecreation and Vocational Services.  \nThe Day Program at the Hogan Regional Center is directed by North\nShore Enterprises.  The program is conducted in two buildings and\nover half of the individuals at Hogan attend the program.  The\nremaining individuals at Hogan attend day programs in the\ncommunity between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.  The day programs range\nfrom very basic skill building to pre-vocational skills.  \nThe Hogan Regional Center is well maintained and exhibited bright\ncheerful artwork throughout the facility.  We noted that the\nstaff takes great pleasure in making each living area as\ncomfortable and well decorated as possible.  This feeling of home\nwas a recurrent theme throughout all of the ICF/MRs that we\nvisited. \nB. The Wrentham Development Center\nOur office visited the Wrentham Development Center at 131 Emerald\nStreet, Wrentham, Massachusetts.  We were extremely impressed\nwith the facility and the level of comprehensive medical care\nthat is provided to each individual.  The facility services\napproximately 325 adults with mental retardation and has a\ncapacity for 343 individuals.  It opened in 1907 and is situated\non 400 acres of open and wooded land.  The configuration of the\nfacility includes 5 large buildings and 13 houses.  The facility\nalso has a state-of-the-art 12 bed acute care medical center. \nThe medical center is also used for diagnostic evaluations,\nreassessment of chronic illness, and/or close medical or nursing\nobservation.  Overall, the facility offers a full range of\nclinical services in the area of medicine, nursing, psychology,\nrecreation, social work, occupational  and physical therapy,\ncommunication, adult education and vocational services.  \nThe Wrentham Development Center also houses the Quinn Program\nCenter for workshops and day activities.

The Monson Development Center\nOur office visited the Monson Development Center at 175 State\nAvenue, Palmer, Massachusetts.  The facility was originally\nopened in 1898 as a hospital for people with epilepsy.  Until\n1970, epilepsy was the common and primary diagnosis for everyone\nadmitted to the facility.  Epilepsy and its treatment often\nresult in the development of many other health conditions, and\nconsequently, Monson has developed sophisticated medical services\nand supports to address the complex medical needs of its\nresidents.  The facility is situated on 588 acres and is located\none mile from the Massachusetts Turnpike.  Monson is a Title XIX \nconsent degree facility that currently supports 186 people with a\ncapacity for 385 people.    \nThe age range for residents at Monson is between 35 to 87.  The\nfunctioning ranges for the residents are between profoundly\nmentally retarded to mild, with 79% of the population functioning\nin the severe to profound range.  The facility has around the\nclock nursing including 4 nurse practitioners and 2 physicians on\nduty between Monday through Friday.  There is an on call\nphysician coverage for nights and weekends.  Other clinical\nservices provided include Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy,\nAdapted Equipment, Psychology, Speech Therapy, Habilitation\nCoordination, Recreation, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy,\nNeurology, Podiatry, Optometry, Psychiatry and Gynecology. \nMonson uses The University of Massachusetts Medical Center and\nThe Wing Memorial Hospital for acute care hospitalizations. \nMonson also has an on-campus hospital, which often shortens stays\nin acute hospitals, and provides extensive health services for\npeople experiencing acute problems.  Monson has an array of day\nprograms including competitive employment, employment workshops,\nretirement services and sensory motor programs.  \nAlthough Monson was opened in 1898, the facility has undergone\ncontinuous renovation since 1975.  Some of the improvements\nincluded upgrading electrical and water systems, renovating 15\nliving areas and permitting decorations and furnishings to\nreflect the personal preferences of the residents and their\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 5 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 5\nfamilies.  There is a strong sense of pride within the facility\nand it is evident in the longevity of the work force as the\naverage years of employment at the facility is 20 years, and the\naverage age of the employees is 45 years (we noted similar\nemployment trends at the other ICF/MRs).\nD. The Glavin Regional Center\nThe Glavin Regional Center in Shrewsbury was opened in May, 1974\nand is situated 123 acres on Lake Street, Shrewsbury,\nMassachusetts.  Each of the approximate 63 resident receives \nresidential and day programs.  Glavin has a capacity of 63\nresidents.  The programs are certified yearly by the Department\nof Public Health under Federal Title XIX Regulations.  Although\nGlavin Regional Center did not come under the consent decree,\napproximately 18 residents who presently reside at the center are\nclass members.  The age for people living at Glavin ranges from\n31 to 83.  Glavin has the capacity to provide a variety of\nprofessional services including nursing, physical therapy,\noccupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, speech and language\npathology, vocational and recreation therapy.   \nGlavin is located high atop a hill with magnificent\nsurrounding views.  The facility is bright, cheerful, well\ndecorated and located just off of Route 9 in Shrewsbury.  \nE. Templeton Development Center\nThe Templeton Development Center is located 70 miles west of\nBoston on 2,600 acres in Baldwinville, Massachusetts.  Templeton\nis a Title XIX certified, state operated intermediate care\nfacility that supports 143 adults with mental retardation with a\ncapacity to support 160 individuals.  Templeton, a Consent Decree\nfacility, was originally developed as an extension of the Walter\nE. Fernald State School in May 1900.  In 1992 Templeton became an\nindependent facility known as Templeton Development Center. \nTempleton provides services for individuals ranging in age from\n26 to 91.  Templeton's residences are comprised of six lodges and\nthree small 8-person homes.  Templeton is an agricultural\ncommunity that has the capacity to provide medical and clinical\nservices to individuals with physical and emotional issues\nassociated with the aging process.  Templeton's medical services\nare provided by Shriver Clinical Group, Henry Heywood Memorial\nHospital and The University of Massachusetts Medical Center. \nTempleton utilizes twenty-four hour nursing coverage, two\nphysician's assistants and a community based medical practice \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 6 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 6\nfor on-site medical care.  Dental service is provide on-site\nthrough a contract with Tufts Dental.  \nTempleton has developed highly specialized supports to assist and\ntreat individuals with challenging behavioral issues.  All\nindividual supports are provided through the ISP team process. \nAn ISP team composed of a QMRP, Nurse, Physician's Assistant,\nSocial Worker, Psychologist, Recreational Therapist, Adult\nEducator, Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor, Occupational\nTherapist, Physical Therapist and Speech Pathologist.   The\nfacility provides on-site educational and vocational supports\nthrough four day programs and six vocational programs.   Two of\nthe on-site vocational programs provide training in the areas of\ndairy operation and farming.  The facility also operates a\nproductive dairy/beef program and a gardening program.    \nF. The Fernald Center\nThe Fernald Developmental Center is distinguished as the Western\nHemisphere’s oldest publicly-funded facility serving individuals\nwho have developmental disabilities.  Fernald is located on 186\nacres in Waltham.  Fernald’s services concentrate on encouraging\neach resident to learn and grow by participating in a variety of\nprograms designed to develop social, work and daily living\nskills.  Between 1924 and 1970, Fernald became a site for\nexpanded research into the causes of mental retardation,\nresulting in the opening of Shriver Center on the Fernald grounds\nin 1970.  In 1974, Fernald entered into the Medicaid (Title XIX)\nprogram and into a consent decree  process.  Since that time,\ndramatic improvements have taken place in the quality of the\nresidents’ lives, and in the quality of services they receive. \nIn 1993, Fernald merged with the Metro Boston Region with a focus\non opportunities in the community for individuals.  In 1998 the\nWalter E. Fernald State School campus became known as The Fernald\nCenter to reflect both the Fernald Developmental Center and the\nMarquardt Skilled Nursing Facility.\nThe individuals who live at Fernald have a range of developmental\ndisabilities and most function at the profound level of\nretardation.  As of September, 2006, there are 189 residents at\nFernald and 29 resident at Marquardt with the age range of 35 -\n94.  The individuals who live at Fernald live in homes with\ngroupings of 5 to 16.  Thirteen buildings, including the\nMarquardt Nursing Home are currently used for residential\nhousing.  Six sites are used for vocational training and\nrecreational pursuits.  Fernald’s residents receive services on\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 7 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 7\nand off grounds, ranging from leisure-based retirement programs\nto supportive employment.  All Fernald residents receive some\nform of social security assistance and are covered by Medicaid. \nThe Fernald Center employs more than 774 staff in administrative,\ndirect care, clinical and support services positions.  About 85\npercent of the staff are engaged in direct care services. \nFernald provides supports and services 24 hours a day.  A team of\ndirect service staff and clinicians work together to meet the\nindividual needs of the individuals who live at Fernald.  The\nteams may include speech, occupational, physical and recreation\ntherapists, direct care staff, adult education, psychology,\nnursing, medical and nutrition staff.  By being in compliance\nwith Title XIX Acts of 1974, Fernald receives Federal\nreimbursements.  Some of the resources at the Fernald Center\ninclude an indoor handicapped accessible pool, gymnasiums,\nActivity Center and a ballfield. \n2. Residential Placement Options Within Community\nA. Residential placement options within the community are\ndivided into essentially three options including\nsupervised living, shared living and family\npartnership.  \n(i) Supervised Living - If a family chooses supervised\nliving they have a preference between a provider\noperated program or a state operated program. \nTypically, individuals can live in a home with\nanywhere from 1 to 5 other individuals.  Each home\nhas a house manager and direct support staff. \nDependent upon the needs of the people living in\nthe homes, there may be a nurse working in the\nhome or available to the home.  Staffing varies\ndepending on the support needs of the individuals,\nbut typically there are 2 direct support staff for\n4 individuals.   These homes have their own\nvehicles for transportation.\n(ii) Shared Living - Individuals have the option of\nliving with a care provider in the care provider’s\nhome.  The care provider can be single or have a\nfamily, and the provider is paid to support the\nindividual.  Oversight of such a living situation\nis provided by a residential support provider\nagency that provides placement, guidance and\noversight.  \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 8 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 8\n(iii)Family Partnership - A family partnership is an\nindividual or family-directed cooperative\narrangement in which a DMR consumer or his or her\nfamily provides or contributes toward the cost of\na residence in which the Department provides or\narranges for services to be provided.  The\narrangement provides individuals and families with\ngreater choice and control over where a family\nmember lives and will receive services such as in\ntheir childhood home or a particular area where an\nindividual grew up or has community connections.   \nB. Community Day Supports\n(i) Community-Based Day Supports - These supports are\nprovided to individuals who qualify for DMR\nservices during the workday hours in lieu of\nemployment supports.  These services offer\nindividuals an opportunity to develop, enhance and\nmaintain their competence and confidence in\npersonal, social and community activities. \nIndividuals who are medically fragile or have\nother significant health, mental health or\nbehavioral issues that limit their ability to be\nengaged in productive work activities.  \n(ii) DMA Day Habilitation - A structured, goal-oriented\nactive treatment program of medically oriented,\ntherapeutic, and habilitation services that are\nintended to raise individuals’ level of\nfunctioning and facilitate independent living and\nself-management in their home communities.\n(iii)Employment Supports - Employment supports are for\nindividuals of all abilities.  Supports assist\nindividuals to prepare for and experience gainful\nemployment, and may include sheltered employment,\nwork crews, enclaves, provider-owned businesses,\nvolunteer work, provider-paid employment, and\nsupported employment, with the overarching goal of\nquality jobs for individuals.\n(iv) Competitive Employment - This is full or part time\npaid work, which is done either in the public or\nprivate sector.  Such work is not supported in any\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 9 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 9\nway by DMR.  Individuals who work competitively\nare on company payroll and may be eligible for all\nemployee benefits.\n(v) DMA Adult Day Health - A program to provide an\nalternative to 24-hour long term institutional\nsettings through an organized program of health\ncare, supervision, restorative services, and\nsocialization.  The Division of Medial Assistance\nadministers this program.\n(vi) DMH Day Program - This Psychiatric Day Treatment\nProgram is a planned combination of diagnostic,\ntreatment, and rehabilitative services provided to\nmentally or emotionally disturbed individuals who\nneed more active or inclusive treatment that is\ntypically available through a weekly visit to a\nmental health center or hospital outpatient\ndepartment, but who do not need full-time\nhospitalization or institutionalization.  Such a\nprogram utilizes multiple, intensive, and focused\nactivities in a supportive environment to enable\nindividuals to acquire more realistic and\nappropriate behavior patterns, attitudes, and\nskills for eventual independent functioning in the\ncommunity.  Such programs may be operated by a\nfreestanding clinic, a satellite facility of a\nclinic, a hospital licensed health center, or an\nidentifiable unit of a clinic, hospital, or\nhospital licensed health center.\n(vii)MCB Day Programs - This Day/Work program is funded\nand operated by the Massachusetts Commission for\nthe Blind (MCB).\n(viii)MRC Employment and Training - These are\nMassachusetts Rehabilitation Commission (MRC)\nfunded employment supports that include extended\nemployment (EEP) at a private rehabilitation\nfacility.  This program offers supported\nemployment in an integrated work setting, or\ntransitional employment work experiences at a\nbusiness or industry for the purpose of providing\nevaluation, training, and supervision.\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 10 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 10\n3. Review of Medical and Clinical Services at the ICF/MRs and \nwithin the Community\nIn an attempt to independently glean a full understanding of the\nmedical and clinical requirements of individuals seeking to\ntransfer from Fernald to other ICF/MRs or to community\nresidences, our office hired independent medical doctors with a\nhistory of caring for individuals afflicted with mental\nretardation.  We asked counsel for the plaintiffs and the\ndefendants to provide a list of qualified medical professionals\nthat had experience in treating and servicing individuals with\nmental retardation.  Once the list was finalized, it was\ndistributed to counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendants.  A\nperiod of time was allowed for our office to receive comments,\nsuggestions and concerns regarding the list of medical\nprofessionals.  Three medical doctors with extensive experience\nservicing individuals with mental retardation were chosen by our\noffice.  Our office had extensive discussions with these doctors,\nand specifically discussed the ISP process and DMR’s use of the\nISP process for both present and future needs of individuals who\nhave transferred from Fernald, and for potential prospective\ntransfers.  \nA. Medical Professionals Hired to Assist the Monitor\nLawrence W. Osborn, M.D., MPH, is the Associate Medical Director\nfor Geriatric Psychiatry at Providence Hospital and Mercy Medical\nCenter.

The Monitor’s Findings\nOur office was asked by the Court to conduct an investigation\ninto whether the “past and prospective transfer processes\nemployed by the Department of Mental Retardation were in\ncompliance with Federal law, State regulations, as well as Orders\nof the Court.”  \nA. DMR’s Certification of Equal or Better Services\nThe plaintiffs have alleged that DMR is in violation of the Final\nOrder of the Court entered on May 25, 1993, because the Facility\nDirector of Fernald is not certifying that individuals to be\ntransferred will receive equal or better services at their new\nresidences.  The plaintiffs are also alleging that the Facility\nDirector is not certifying that ISP recommended services for the\nindividual's current needs are available at the new location\n(see: Pleading #83, p. 4 of 21). \nDMR has responded by stating that \"the completed Individual\nService Plan, in conjunction with the ISP Process represents the\ncertification by the Facility Director (Linda Montminy) that the\nIndividual's needs are being met in the new location\" (Letter\nfrom Marianne Meacham to Beryl Cohen dated September 26, 2005;\nand Pleading #86, p. 13, Section C; Diane Enochs Aff. ¶ 10).  \nThe 1993 Final Order of the Court provides as follows:\n“Defendants shall not approve a transfer of any \nclass member out of state school into the \ncommunity, or from one community residence to \nanother such residence, until and unless the\nSuperintendent of the transferring school \n(or the Regional Director of the pertinent \ncommunity region) certifies that the individual \nto be transferred will receive equal or better \nservices to meet their needs in the new location, \nand that all ISP-recommended services for the\nindividuals current needs as identified in \nthe ISP are available at the new location.”  \nRicci v. Okin, M.D. et. al., 823 F.Supp. 984, 987 (D. Mass.\n1993).  \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 14 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 14\nOur office noted that the Court did not specify how the\ncertification must be made, but it is clear that certification\nmust be made.  The Final Order is also silent on whether\ncertification is required when transferring from one ICF/MR to\nanother ICF/MR.  Given these parameters, our office conducted an\ninvestigation into how the Facility Director certified that\nservices currently being received would be duplicated and perhaps\nbetter at the new residence.    \nOur office independently verified that DMR, through its Facility\nDirector, has certified for the 49 individuals transferred\npreviously, that services will be equal or better.  This\ncertification was made through the Facility Director's review of\nobjectives of an individual's current ISP as compared to their\nnew ISP at the new location.  Following January, 2005 DMR\nimplemented a return to an explicit certification of equal or\nbetter services in the Ricci Change of Address Form for any\ntransfers of class members.  Our office also had the medical\ndoctors that we retained review the ISPs of the individuals that\ntransferred from Fernald to determine if the services received\nafter the transfer met their needs.    \nOf note is DMR’s position that transfers from an ICF/MR to\nanother ICF/MR do not require a certification of equal or better\nbecause such certification is not required by the Final Order. \nAlthough the Final Order is silent on this specific scenario, our\noffice found that all of the ICF/MRs were Title XIX certified. \nEach facility currently has the minimum services, staffing and\namenities to provide equal or better services.  As expected, each\nICF/MR has its own individual character and differing degrees of\nspecialized services.  The staff at all the ICF/MRs are extremely\nexperienced and long tenured. \nThrough our tours of various community homes we witnessed\nservices consistent with the Court’s Final Order including the \nfollowing: “residential programs; day programs; recreational and\nleisure time activities; medical, psychological, dental and\nhealth-related professional services; respite care and crisis\nintervention services; support and generic services, such as\nguardianship and adaptive equipment services; and transportation\nservices.”  Ricci, 823 F.Supp. at 987.  The medical doctors that\nwe retained also confirmed that these services are available in\nthe community, and reviewed the housing, health, employment and\noccupational needs of the clients.  Individuals transferred to\nthe community can receive these services equal or better than at\nthe ICF/MRs.      \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 15 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 15\nWhile the services that are listed in the Final Order are\navailable in the community, the issue is evaluating how these\nservices are accessed and delivered, what the wait time is for\nthese services and where the services are located as compared\nwith where the individual resides and how that may impact on an\nindividual basis “equal or better.”  Our office received a\npresentation from DMR regarding Medical Services to Ricci Class\nMembers in the Community.  This presentation shed light on how an\nindividual in a community residence actually sees a physician and\nreceives dental care.  In the community residences the direct\ncare staff makes the arrangements and appointments for a specific\nresident.  Ultimately, this process takes much longer than the\nprocess at Fernald and is more difficult to coordinate (i.e. our\noffice noted that community residences have one wheelchair\nadaptive vehicle assigned per house.  If this vehicle has to be\nused for pick-up and drop-off of other residents from day\nprograms, coordination must be made with other vehicles operated\nby the provider).  Based on the information provided one could\nnot conclude that quicker access to medical care in and of itself\nequated to better care (the bedside manner of the community\ndoctor located 20 minutes away could be better than the facility\ndoctor that is on call, or just the opposite could be the case). \nBut, given the physical limitations, and fragile emotional state\nof members of this population, coupled with a reduced mental\ncapacity to communicate and explain an increase or decrease in\nthe intensity of an ailment, we certainly understand the\npotential risks and why some guardians would prefer to have their\nward in an ICF/MR and have a facility doctor on call. \n   \nAn individual living in a community residence attends day\nprograms outside of the residence.  Some day programs offer a\nmyriad of services during the day program including speech\ntherapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy.  Our office\ndid note that some therapy, such as aquatic therapy in a heated\nroom with a heated pool, are more difficult to access in the\ncommunity.  Aquatic therapy can be duplicated in the community\nbut with effort.  \nLastly, DMR organized tours of community residences throughout\nMassachusetts for our office.  Counsel for the plaintiffs were\ninvited to attend these tours.  Our office also toured specific\ncommunity homes at the request of counsel for the plaintiffs. \nOur tours revealed well maintained homes in very nice\nneighborhoods.  The staffing patterns varied dependent upon the\nneeds of the residents.  Our office did note that the tenure of\nmost House Managers within community residences was less than 3\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 16 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 16\nyears, with 5 years being a rarity.  Staff turnover was in some\ninstances 100% every year and a half.  Repeatedly, our office\nheard, from guardians and providers, that an on-going struggle is\nto maintain the continuity of staffing for better on-going care. \nThe direct cause for the high turnover rate was the challenging\nwork coupled with the low pay scale.  \nGuardians were present on some of the tours to discuss their\nexperience of having their ward/family member in a community\nhome.  Some of the comments we heard included the joy of having\ntheir ward in his/her own home; having his/her own room to\ndecorate with personal belongings without having something\ndisappear; being closer to family and friends and taking\nadvantage of community events; being able to cook in the kitchen,\ninteract with the same roommates and being part of a community\naround the home.  The recreational activities varied from home to\nhome but essentially involved community activities such as summer\nconcerts, picnics, shopping at the mall, going to restaurants,\narts and crafts, holiday and birthday parties at the home and\nwalking through the neighborhood.  While one goal of the\ncommunity residences is to integrate adults with disabilities\nwithin the community, a bedroom in a neighborhood home does not\nguarantee integration into the fabric of a neighborhood or a\ncommunity.  It takes an effort and commitment on the part of the\nprovider to maximize these opportunities.  From the perspective\nof DMR, as well as the guardians and the residents, community\nplacement for many individuals has been a great success.  \nGiven that medical and rehabilitative services, outlined by the\nCourt’s Final Order, can be met within the community, albeit\nthrough the more labor intensive methods used by direct care\nstaff, our office found that DMR was in compliance for the\ntransferred residents with certifying equal or better services in\nthe community.  It is important to note the vulnerability of many\nof these residents.  Though those already in community homes\nappear to have adapted well, many seem younger than the average\nage of those still residing at ICF/MRs.  \nUnfortunately, after reviewing data from the Disabled Persons\nProtection Commission, our office did note some very concerning\nneglect and abuse trends in Contract Vendor operated community\nresidences, as compared to the ICF/MRs and State operated\ncommunity residences.  These neglect and abuse trends,\nparticularly sexual abuse, were of great concern to our office\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 17 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 17\nand shows that residents in our community homes are at a greater\nrisk of being abused and/or neglected.1 \nB. The Green United States Postal Service Registered \nMail Cards (Sent with the “Notice of Request \nfor Proposed Facility Transfer” letter Returned to\nDMR with the Guardian’s Signature).\nOur office independently reviewed each file of the individuals\ntransferred and found that DMR was in compliance with documenting\nthe properly signed returned receipt of each Registered Mail Card\nfrom guardians.  \nC. Notice of and Request for Proposed\nFacility Transfer (“45-Day Letter)\n(i) Documentation that 45-Day Letter was sent to Guardians\nOur office independently reviewed each file of the individuals\ntransferred and found evidence that the 45-Day Letter was sent to\n“individual’s family, guardian, and designated representative”\npursuant to 115 CMR 6.63. \n(ii) Receipt of the 45-Day Letter\nOur office independently reviewed each file of the individuals\ntransferred and found that DMR was in compliance with documenting\nthe receipt of Notice of and Request for Proposed Facility\nTransfer Letter pursuant to 115 CMR 6.63(2) of the Department of\nMental Retardation Transfer Regulations.  The letters are\n1 The Disabled Persons Protection Commission provided our\noffice with Vender Survey Reports for all ICF/MRs dating back to\nJanuary, 1996.  We also reviewed Vender Survey Reports for State\noperated community residences and Contract Vendor operated\ncommunity residences dating back to 2002.  Our office noted that\nover the years there was a steady increase in allegations of\nsexual abuse and physical abuse in Vendor operated community\nresidences.  The highest levels of sexual abuse occurred with the\ntransportation providers for the Vendor operated community\nresidences.  Physical abuse was much higher in Vender operated\ncommunity residences than in the ICF/MRs. Our office also noted\nthat unreported incidents of abuse may even be higher in\ncommunity residences due to the non-verbal nature of the clients.\nLastly, there was very little to no sexual abuse noted for all of\nthe ICF/MRs.     \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 18 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 18\ncomplete with all the information required by the Regulation, and\nclearly provided guidelines for the appellate process (115 CMR\n6.63(4)) before the Division of Administrative Law Appeals if the\nward’s ISP could not be fully implemented as a result of her\nguardian’s objection to the proposed transfer.  \nOur office also noted that pursuant to 115 CMR 6.63(2)(c ) and\n115 CMR 663(2)(d) 2 and 3, that each guardian, through their\nconsent to the proposed facility transfer, waived the 45-day\nwaiting period.  \nOur office did not find any evidence that the 45-Day Letter was\ndelivered to other parties, as described in 115 CMR 6.63(2)(a). \nOur office could not determine who, other than the legal\nguardian, would be entitled to receive this Letter.  A copy of\nthis Letter is maintained in the individual’s permanent file at\nFernald.    \n(iii)The Right to Visit and Examine the Proposed Homes\nOur office found that although the specific language providing a\nright to visit was not always present in the 45-Day Letter for\nproposed moves, most of the guardians indicated that they had\nvisited the new proposed residences.  Our office would suggest\nthat DMR insert the right to visit language in every 45-Day\nLetter whether or not a guardian has visited the proposed ICF/MR\nor proposed community residence.  The specific language in 115\nCMR 6.63(2)(c)(3) is as follows: “include a statement that the\nparties may visit and examine the proposed home at a time and in\na manner not disruptive to individuals who may be living in the\nhome.”  \n(iv) Language within the 45-Day Letter Inviting \nGuardians to Consult with Service Coordinators \nand Other Staff Regarding the Advantages and\nDisadvantages of the Transfer\nOur office independently reviewed the files of all the\nindividuals that transferred and found language in each\n45-Day Letter identifying the telephone number for the\nDMR Service Coordinator/QMRP, and other individuals\nworking for DMR available to discuss with the Guardian\nthe new ICF/MR or community residence.  DMR is in\ncompliance with 115 CMR 6.63(2)(c)(4).  \n(v) Allegations of DMR Violating 42 CFR 483.12 (Code of\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 19 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 19\nFederal Regulations)\nOur office did not find any violations by DMR of 42 CFR 483.12. \nSpecifically, these regulations pertain to the admission,\ndischarge and transfer standards for skilled nursing facilities\nand nursing facilities in general, and do not address the\ntransfer of residents from ICF/MRs.  \n(vi) DMR’s Consultation with the Guardians of the 49\nTransferees\nOur office has verified that DMR received the consent of all of\nthe guardians for the transfer of all 49 individuals from\nFernald.  Some of these Guardians, representatives and family\nmembers were located out of state, and thus there was a varying\nlevel of involvement of each individual.  \n(vii) The Right to Return Letter\nOur office found that for individuals being transferred from\nFernald to another ICF/MR, DMR did not provide the Guardians with\na Right to Return Letter.  DMR’s position was that these\nindividuals were not transferring from an ICF/MR to the community\nand thus it was not necessary to provide the Guardian with a\nRight to Return Letter.  \nOur office identified six individuals transferred from Fernald\nfollowing the Court’s June 15, 2005 hearing making it clear that\nanyone who leaves can return if they choose.  Following this\nhearing, approximately six individuals were transferred from\nFernald to the community and each individual’s file contained a\nRight to Return Letter.  Prior to this hearing date, such a\nletter was not routinely provided to Guardians of individuals\nthat transferred from Fernald to the community.   \n(ix) Informed Consent Regulations\nThe plaintiffs allege that DMR failed to comply with State\nregulatory requirements to obtain knowing consent, voluntarily\ngiven by an individual’s guardian, of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the proposed move.  Specifically, the plaintiffs\ncontend that DMR has failed to comply with 115 CMR5.08(1)-(3) by\nutilizing a blanket consent form that states as follows:\n\"I (guardian) have received timely notice of the        \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 20 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 20\nproposed transfer pertaining to (individual) from\n(place) to (place) on or about (date) pursuant to 115\nCMR 6.63(2) of the regulations of the Department of\nMental Retardation.  I have also received notice of my\nrights under these regulations.  I understand my right\nto deny consent to the proposed transfer and my right\nto a hearing.  After considering the information I have\nreceived about the proposed transfer, I am satisfied\nthat this transfer is in (individual's) best interest. \nAll my questions have been answered to my full\nsatisfaction.  I, therefore, choose not to object and\nhereby consent to the proposed transfer.”\n(Pleading #83, p. 9).\nDMR responded by stating that plaintiffs are relying on\nregulatory provisions for “informed consent” that pertain to\nadmission to a [nursing] facility or prior to medical or other\ntreatment that requires the risks and benefits of admission or\nmedical treatment.  DMR’s position was as follows:\n“The Fernald Plaintiffs erroneously contend that the\nvoluntary transfer of an individual from a Department\nfacility requires the \"informed consent\" of the\nindividual or guardian.  \"Informed consent\" is a term\nof art defined in the Department's regulations, and is\nrequired only in limited instances and is generally\nreserved for medical procedures, research activities,\nfacility admissions or related activities.  See 115 CMR\n§ 5.08.  Transfer from one setting to another requires\nconsent, not \"informed consent\" as defined in 115 CMR §\n5.08; nevertheless, the 45-day letter and consent form\nthe Department provides during the transfer process\nclearly meets this standard as well as the standard set\nforth in 115 CMR § 2.01's definition of \"consent.\"”\n(Pleading #86, p. 25 fn. 13).  \nOur office found that pursuant to 115 CMR 5.08, informed consent\nof an individual, or a guardian, is required (a) prior to\nadmission to a facility; (b) prior to medical treatment; (c )\nprior to involvement of an individual in research activities; (d)\nprior to level II or III behavior modification interventions; and\n(e) prior to the release of personal information.  In addition,\nthe person securing consent shall: (1) explain the intended\noutcome and nature of procedure involved in the proposed\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 21 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 21\ntreatment; (2) explain the risks, side effects of treatment or\nactivity; (3) explain the alternatives to the proposed treatment;\n(4) explain that consent may be withheld or withdrawn; (5)\npresent the information in a foregoing manner understood by the\nindividual; and (6) offer to answer additional questions.  \nInformed consent is a term associated with medical procedures,\nnot requests to transfer.  The doctrine of informed consent\nimposes on a physician the duty to explain the procedure to the\npatient and to warn him of any inherent risks or dangers, it is\nspecific to the medical procedure and is not intended to be used\nsynonymous to the requirement of consent. See Kissinger v.\nLofgren, 836 F.2d 678, 680 (1st Cir. 1988) (explaining doctrine\nof informed consent in Massachusetts requires a plaintiff to\nestablish (1) the existence of a duty owed by the defendant to\ninform about significant risks, consequences, and options of a\nmedical treatment, and (2) that breach of this duty caused harm\nto plaintiff).  Requiring “Informed Consent” is specific to\nmedical procedures and treatments.  See Rosaria v. U.S., 824 F.\nSupp. 268, 286 (Mass. 1993) (explaining the doctrine of informed\nconsent derives from the notion that a person has a strong\ninterest in being free from non-consensual invasion of his bodily\nintegrity; person needs to make an intelligent decision whether\nto proceed with a specific course of treatment); Goldstein v.\nKelleher, 728 F.2d 32, 39 (1st Cir. 1984) (finding that informed\nconsent rest on foresight, not hindsight, where patient would not\nhave undergone medical procedure had she known the risks);\nHarrison v. U.S., 284 F.3d 293, (1st Cir. 2002) (finding that a\nphysician must disclose any material information to enable\npatient to make an informed judgment whether to give or withhold\nconsent to a medical or surgical procedure). \nDMR’s Notice of and Request for Consent to proposed Facility\nTransfer letter in fact complies with the consent requirement for\ntransfers involving non-medical circumstances.  115 CMR § 5.08\nrequires informed consent for medical procedures and other\npotential invasion tactics or procedures such as Level II or III\nmodification interventions (restraining an individual) or\ninvolving a person in research activities.  This is not similar\nto a guardian providing consent to have his/her ward transferred\nto another ICF/MR or a community residence. \nLastly, the plaintiffs rely on 42 CFR 483.12 as stating that DMR\nfailed to comply with this Regulation prior to transferring 49\nindividuals.  42 CFR 483.12 governs specialized services for\nmental illness or mental retardation for persons found to require\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 22 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 22\ncare within a skilled nursing facility.  We did not find that\nthis Regulation applied to ICF/MRs.  see also Rolland v. Romney,\n318 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2003)(holding the Commonwealth is\nresponsible for providing specialized services that result in\nactive treatment when combined with services provided by nursing\nfacilities); Rolland v. Cellucci, 138 F.Supp.2d 110 (D. Mass.\n2001)(The State was required to provide specialized services to\nthe mentally retarded regardless of whether they resided in\nprivate nursing homes or state-owned facilities).   \nOur office did not find that DMR initiated any transfers without\nthe full knowledge and consent of guardians.  There were no\nallegations from any of the guardians, or from our medical\ndoctors, that there were any unmet active treatment needs for the\nindividuals transferred.\n D. Post Placement Satisfaction Surveys from\nGuardians of the Transferees\nAll of the individuals that responded to the Post Placement\nSatisfaction Surveys affirmatively stated they participated in\nplanning for their ward’s placement.  The surveys were measured\nby numerical rankings with #1 being the most favorable and #5\nbeing the least.  The ratings were as follows:\n(I) 78%  rating #1\n(ii) 14%  rating #2\n(iii)2% rating #3\n(iv) 1% rating #4\n(v) 1% rating #5\n(vi) 4% not rating at all but writing commentary.\nThe written commentary reflected extremely positive attitudes\nregarding the moves.  A recurrent theme found was hesitancy to\nmove from Fernald due to familiarity.  Many of the guardians\nstated that they decided to transfer their ward from Fernald\nbased on the announcement that Fernald will be closing.  The\ncomments were positive regarding the moves for a variety of\nreasons.  There were recurrent themes of reduced care at Fernald\ndue to staffing issues and low morale.  The other ICF/MRs were\npraised for their wonderful staff, an improvement in services and\nenvironment.  There was praise for the Fernald staff,\nparticularly when it came to assisting in the transition, but the\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 23 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 23\ngeneral sense was the lack of certainty in the closing of Fernald\nwas causing problems. 2\nWith regard to Guardians that preferred a transfer from Fernald\nto the community, the responses were also positive.  Many\nGuardians reported an opportunity to visit their children, wards\nand siblings more frequently and at any time of the day.  The\nresponses to the surveys did not give the impression that there\nwas any concerns or tendencies to seek a return to Fernald. \nE. The Home and Community Based Services Waiver Program\nThe plaintiff’s contend that DMR failed to fully explain the\n“Home and Community Based Services” Waiver Program to the\nguardians so that the guardians could make an informed consent to\nproposed community placement.  Informed consent was discussed\nabove in section ix, and our office found no Federal Law, State\nRegulations and any Orders of this Court requiring DMR to have a\nspecific discussions with guardians on the Home and Community\nBased Services Waiver Program.    \n \n5. The Monitor’s Final Assessment\nDMR's directive to close Fernald has come with an offer by DMR\nfor any resident seeking to remain at an ICF/MR, having the\noption of transferring to another ICF/MR.  All of the ICF/MRs are\nTitle XIX certified and DMR claims that they all have the\ncapacity to potentially meet the need to provide equal or better\ntreatment, care, professional services and medical treatment to\nall of the Fernald residents.  With the appropriate involvement\nof family members and/or guardians, each resident at Fernald\ncould be transferred to another ICF/MR to achieve the objective\nof closing Fernald, but clearly at a cost to individual\nresidents.  In this respect, DMR can duplicate the basic services\nand medical treatment for any resident at any of its ICF/MRs. \nUnfortunately, this solution does not solve the underlying\nproblem.  \nThe true issue plaguing the plaintiffs as a whole runs much\ndeeper than simply transferring all of Fernald's residents to\nanother ICF/MR.   For many residents, Fernald is their home, the\naverage age is 57 years, the average length of stay is 47 years,\n2 It should be noted that 6 individuals of the 49 individuals who transferred from\nFernald died within 2 years of the transfers.  \n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 24 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 24\nthe oldest resident is 95 and has been there for 81 years.  The\nquestion is simply after all these years at this facility will\ntheir lives be equal or better if transferred elsewhere?  As the\nguardians are getting older, they express both a fear and a\nmistrust.  The guardians have expressed a fear of who will care\nfor their loved ones, and a mistrust of whether promises made\ntoday will be broken in the future.  The plaintiffs also claim\nthat given the high level of sexual and physical abuse in the\ncommunity, lack of accessibility to medical and dental services,\nalong with high staff turnover and potentially less qualified\nstaff, residential community homes are not the answer for many\nresidents.  Another concern is that although individuals in\ncommunity residences supposedly have access to community\nactivities, residing in the community does not guarantee that an\nindividual will be integrated into the community.   The\nplaintiffs fear that following Fernald’s closing, Wrentham,\nMonson, Hogan, Glavin and Templeton will soon follow.  The\nplaintiffs hold a genuine fear of years and years of shuffling\nsons, daughters and wards in an attempt to stay ahead of the next\nclosure before being forced into community residences.  \nThis very fragile segment of the Massachusetts’ population\nstrives for simplicity and constants to thrive and conduct their\ndaily lives, and the threat of change does have an impact on the\nphysical and emotional health of some of the residents.  Similar\nto our old shoes that fit just right, or that favorite reclining\nchair that has molded perfectly to a body over the years, or the\nroom and building we have spent our life calling home and those\naround us we consider family and friends, we all seek familiarity\nto ground our lives.  We cherish these items for the\nindescribable comfort that they provide.  For the severely\nmentally retarded, such a loss of familiar surroundings and most\nimportantly people, could have devastating effects that unravel\nyears of positive, non-abusive behavior.  Moreover, the joy that\neach of us experiences from seeing the same person who serves\nmorning coffee at the coffee shop, or that neighborhood person\nwho greets you every morning for the past umpteen years, is also\nexperienced ten fold by, in many cases, this segment of the\npopulation that has been cared for by the same State workers for\nten, twenty and even thirty years in the ICF/MRs.  Change for\nmost of us comes at a cost, for the most vulnerable, the\nslightest change can have dramatic and permanent consequences.\nOur office has been touched by the families willing to share\ntheir stories with us over the past year.  The story of one\nmother and father who showed love and support for their\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 25 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 25\nson/daughter, and concerned that the closure of Fernald would\nmean a mad rush for the choice locations, decided to move their\nchild.  Their child had been cared for brilliantly at Fernald for\nover 40 years.  Within one year, they received a call that their\nchild was found on the floor and had died.  Today, they ask\nthemselves, in an attempt to do the right thing, had they failed\ntheir child by moving him/her after so many years of him/her\nflourishing at Fernald?  The same fears grip others and for two\nSundays and over twelve hours our office listened to such\nconcerns by no less than 200 caring parents, sisters, brothers,\naunts, uncles, guardians, nieces, nephews and friends.  Our\noffice has been inundated with pleas to keep Fernald open since\nnow, through the Court’s intervention, Fernald is a much\ndifferent place and has reached respectable levels of care. \nOn one particular Sunday our office spent six hours listening to\nstories portraying Fernald during those dark years when the\nconditions were atrocious.  Now, they proclaimed, Fernald is a\nplace where people can thrive and truly call home.  Faces are\nfamiliar and people have brought laughter to the halls and the\nprograms.  On another Sunday we were invited to morning Service\nby Father William Leonard.  We were moved by the outpouring of\nyoung volunteers from the community that wheeled residents from\nthe Green building across the street to the Chapel for Sunday\nService.  Those same volunteers either stayed or returned in time\nto escort the residents back to the Green building upon\ncompletion of Services.  The community had embraced the residents\nat Fernald and the residents enjoyed their Sunday morning\nService.  Overall, we all work hard every day to provide comfort,\nstability and security for our families.  We cannot imagine after\nresiding in a home for thirty, forty or fifty years, and finally\ngetting it to the point where you feel comfortable, stable and\nsecure, that you are now told to pack up and move with\npotentially more moves to endure.  Any of us would be outraged.  \nToday there are far fewer citizens in our ICF/MRS than a decade\nago.  For those that have moved into the community homes and are\nthriving this has been a good and important outcome.  The\nCommonwealth in its attempt to address excess capacity is moving\ntowards consolidation.  There are other options that can address\nexcess capacity and achieve some savings without resorting to\nclosure of this facility. \nIn an attempt to find a solution for the Fernald residents, our\noffice was surprised to find such vast acreage surrounding the\nvarious ICF/MRs.  Glavin has 123 acres, Monson has 588 acres,\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 26 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 26\nTempleton has 2,600 acres, Wrentham has 400 acres and Fernald has\n186 acres.  At Fernald, it may be possible to group the homes and\nwork sites of Fernald residents by dividing the buildings north\nof Pine Street and west of Cherry Lane and condense the campus. \nThe Commonwealth could then sell the remainder of the land for\nresidential development.  DMR could also build some new\nresidential homes on the land and have support services for these\nresidents at Fernald.  \nServicing individuals with mental retardation in ICF/MRs and the\ncommunity each offers advantages and disadvantages to both\nsystems.  The model across the United States appears to be\nshifting toward housing the mentally retarded in community\nresidences.  Despite this trend, the strength that Massachusetts\nholds is allowing families to have a choice for their family\nmembers and wards.  As this segment of the population ages, their\nparents and relatives are also aging.  Many of the residents at\nFernald have family members that live within close proximity to\nFernald.  We have met numerous individuals through our visits to\nFernald that have expressed how difficult it would be for them to\ndrive the distance to another ICF/MR to make that daily or weekly\ncommute to visit their loved ones.  Our office was amazed at the\nmany residents at Fernald that have lived there for thirty, forty\nand fifty plus years.  Many of the State workers can boast twenty\nor thirty years tenure at Fernald.  These employees have become\nmore than individuals waiting to achieve the benefits of State\nretirement, they are family to the residents who rely on them\nevery day for the most basic needs that we take for granted. \nBreaking these decade long bonds is not the solution these\nresidents deserve, nor should they be forced to experience\ncountless moves given the conditions they had to endure before\nthe Court's intervention.  \nSince the Monitor’s Appointment in February, 2006, our office has\nwitnessed outstanding medical and social care in all of the\nICF/MRs.  The quality of life for the ICF/MR residents is\nexcellent, and this Court’s persistence and insistence, over the\npast three decades, in raising the level of care for the mentally\nretarded is certainly remarkable.  The Herculean effort\nshouldered by this Court since the early 1970s has, without\ndoubt, enriched the lives of our mentally retarded citizens. \nThis Court’s effort is reminiscent of another monumental\nundertaking by the late Honorable Judge A. David Mazzone to\nrevitalize Boston’s Harbor as a waterway capable of nurturing and\nsustaining life.  In many ways, this Court has accomplished the\nsame task, as guardians of individuals residing within the\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 158   Filed 03/06/07   Page 27 of 27\nThe Monitor’s Report\nMarch 6, 2007\nPage 27\nICF/MRs have provided our office with a clear understanding that\nthe residents within these facilities receive the support that\nnurtures and enhances their quality of life.\nAs a result of a year long investigation, our office has\nconcluded that some of the residents at Fernald could suffer an\nadverse impact, either emotionally and/or physically, if they\nwere forced to transfer from Fernald to another ICF/MR or to a\ncommunity residence.  Our office would recommend the\nimplementation of a development plan that would enable Fernald to\nremain open and provide services to some of the Commonwealth’s\nmost vulnerable citizens. \nIn summary, based on our review of all the conditions that are\nconsidered for \"equal or better\" services, it is the opinion of\nthe Monitor that residents should continue to have the\nopportunity and option to move from Fernald to other ICF/MRs, or\nto a community residence, provided that the Certification Process\nis enforced.  Additionally, and most importantly, considering the\nuniqueness of each of the ICF/MRs, and the vulnerability of the\nresidents, Fernald residents should be allowed to remain at the\nFernald facility, since for some, many or most, any other place\nwould not meet an \"equal or better\" service outcome. \nWe are available at your convenience to provide any further\ninformation regarding this report.  Thank you for the opportunity\nto assist the Court.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Michael J. Sullivan\n_____________________\nMICHAEL J. SULLIVAN\nUnited States Attorney \n/s/ Rayford A.

After two years of meetings in which the Wrentham\nClass made specific requests for information and policy changes to address shortcomings in\nDMR’s service system, with little or no movement by DMR1, the Wrentham Class is again\ncompelled to seek the Court’s oversight in requiring DMR to provide all Class members,\nregardless of where they reside, a safe and secure environment in which they will receive the\ncare to which they are entitled under the Disengagement Order and their Individual Service Plans\n(“ISPs”).\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were the best of times for Class members and their\nguardians.  Under this Court’s oversight, funding became available for existing facilities to be\n1 On April 12, 2004, pursuant to Paragraph 7(c) of this Court’s 1993 Order, Attorney Lisa Goodheart notified DMR\nof its failure to comply with the Order.  The parties then met on May 28, June 7, June 8, September 15, 2004, and\nNovember 11, 2004 in an attempt to resolve the issues raised in the 7(c) letter, but to no avail.  The agenda for the\ninitial 7(c) meeting is attached hereto as Ex. 1.  The agenda included staffing issues in the community; periodic\nindependent review of community programs; facility closure issues and the Equal or Better Transfer Certifications.\nEach of these topics is a subject of the Wrentham Association’s Motion.\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 2 of 58\nrehabilitated and new group homes were developed.  Class members who left facilities during\nthis time period were assured of, and in fact received, care that was equal or better than that\nprovided in the facilities.   Having righted the wrongs that had persisted for decades, the\nDisengagement Order created the roadmap for maintaining all the progress that had been made.\nThose heady times are far behind us.  Once again, the money is tight, other problems are\nconsidered more pressing, and Class members are suffering as a result.\nThe landscape, in many ways so different from what was presented to the Court in the\n1970s, has much in common with that era.  Neglect and substandard care is the inevitable result\nof an equation in which there are thousands of vulnerable people, and a state agency that is\nstrapped for funds is doing the best it can.  As was the case thirty years ago, the\nCommonwealth’s “best” is plainly not good enough.  This time, the majority of Class residents\nare not “warehoused” in large facilities.  Instead, Class members who are the victims of sexual\nabuse, medication errors, physical assaults and outright neglect are three times more likely to be\nliving in the community.  The services provided by DMR through its point of sale (“POS”)\ncontractors are not equal to what they were fifteen years ago, and for many Class members the\ncare they currently receive is far worse than when they first moved into the community.   For\nmany Class members, the care hasn’t been “equal or better” for years. It is once again necessary\nfor this Court to scrutinize DMR’s performance.\nI. Class Members In Community-Based Homes Need Protection From Their\nCaregivers Because DMR(cid:182)s Does Not Provide Adequate Staff.\nThere has been a consistent effort by DMR to decrease its involvement in direct care –\nfewer and fewer DMR employees actually provide hands-on care to Class members.  Instead, the\ntrend has been to have service coordinators monitor the care provided by POS vendors.  Thus,\nthe large majority of staff at community-based homes are contractors.  There are almost 300 POS\n2\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 3 of 58\nvendors, many of whom operate multiple sites.  As of June, 2003, there were a total of 10,768\nDMR clients receiving services in residential settings that were not their homes.2  Of that total,\n2,156 individuals lived in state settings (992 in DMR-operated group homes and 1,164 in\nfacilities).3  Accordingly, 8,612 individuals, or 80% of this population was cared for by POS\nvendors in 2003.\nOf the 4,400+ Class members, approximately 25% continue to reside in intermediate care\nfacilities for the mentally retarded (“ICFMRs” or “facilities”) and approximately 75% live in the\ncommunity, mostly in group homes.  While the numbers are not clear, it is estimated that more\nthan 3,000 Class members are cared for by POS contractors.  That ratio is likely to be higher\nnow, given the recent transfers from Fernald.\nA.   Class members in group homes are subjected to higher rates of medication errors,\nsexual abuse and violence.\n  The Disabled Persons Protection Committee (“DPPC”) investigates claims of abuse\nagainst individuals with mental disabilities who are between the ages of 18-59 under Mass. Gen.\nL. c. 19C.  In response to a public records request, the DPPC provided abuse summaries for\nfiscal years 2002 and 2003 for claims in residential settings where the abuse allegations were\nsubstantiated under the c. 19C requirements (i.e., abuse which results in serious physical or\nserious emotional injury to a  person with a disability).  118 CMR 2.02.   In FY 2002, there were\n114 substantiated claims of abuse in residential, non-facility settings, and 121 substantiated\nreports in FY 2003.  This is not to say that DMR facilities are immune from the same reports.

Charlie Lakin,\nEditors) at 65, Table 2.2, available athttp://rtc.umn.edu/docs/risp2004.pdf.\n3 These figures differ from those reported in the DMR Quality Assurance Report, Fiscal Years 2002-2003, Ex. 2,\nwhich states that DMR population residing in community homes in 2003 was 12,417.  The increase could be\nattributable the 1,550+ individuals receiving services in host/foster families.  QA Report, Table 18, at page 32\n(listing total community and facility populations).\n3\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 4 of 58\nfact, there were 14 substantiated reports of abuse in DMR facilities in FY 2002, and 11 in FY\n2003.\nBased on the DPPC data, the rate of substantiated abuse at DMR facilities in FY 2003\nwas 10/1000, but it was 12.4/1000 for individuals who resided in vendor-operated group homes.4\nBecause the population of individuals in community-based homes is 8,612, compared to 1,164 in\nthe facilities (as of June 2003), if the rate of abuse were equal, then one would expect that the\nsubstantiated claims of abuse in community homes could be estimated by multiplying the\nsubstantiated reports at facilities by a factor of 7.4.  Yet that is far from the case – the FY 2002\nsubstantiated claims in which the victims resided in community-based homes exceeded 104 (7.4\nx 14 substantiated reports in facilities), and the FY 2003 disparity is even greater.  Using the 7.4\nfactor, one would estimate the number of abuse incidents at 81 (7.4 x 11), yet the actual number\nof substantiated reports of abuse in community-based homes in FY 2003 was 121 – 50% higher\nthan would be expected.   Because the DPPC complaints are confidential, there is no way to\ndetermine if Class members are among the victims, but on average, one out of every four DMR\nclients is a Class member.\nThere are other troubling disparities in two specific types of complaints.  Most disturbing\nis the fact that 13% of substantiated complaints against POS vendors involved sexual abuse.\nOnly 4% of the substantiated complaints against DMR care providers involved sexual abuse.\nAdditionally, medication errors represent 7% of the substantiated complaints against POS\nvendors, but only 2% of the complaints against DMR as a care provider (including DMR-\noperated group homes).  The summaries of the abuse can be graphic and shocking, at times\nheartbreaking because they demonstrate that this is such a vulnerable population.\n4 Of the 121 substantiated reports of abuse, 15 involved individuals who resided at DMR-operated group homes,\nsuch that 106 of the reports described abuse suffered by residents of vendor-operated homes.\n4\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 5 of 58\n  Substantiated claims of sexual abuse include the following:\nPROVIDER  DATE  SUMMARY\nCenter Of Hope- 12/11/2002 ALV reported that ALAB had taken her into a ladies room on\nQRADH a community outing last June and put his hands down her\npants and put his fingers in \"her hole\".

ALV stated that she wet herself in the\nmorning.  ALV said Angela was upset because she wet\nherself.  ALV said nobody changed her.  ALV remained in\nwet clothes all day.  ALV did not eat her lunch or snacks.\nALV cried all the way home.  ALV said she felt \"yucky.\"\nSeven Hills 6/25/2002 ALV's behaviors have been increasing over the last two\nFoundation weeks.  ALV is adamant when ALAB is on that she doesn't\nwant ALAB near her.  ALV stated that she was dragged\nacross the floor by ALAB and she cut the bottom of her feet.\nALAB cleaned up the blood.  Staff found a large burn mark\non ALV's back that was 3\" x 1/2\" and 3 smaller marks\nwhich all appear to be friction burns.\nSeven Hills 5/2/2003  ALV has unexplained injuries.

REPT doesn't\nbelieve that ALV has bruising on his leg.  Other staff have heard\nthat ALAB has a stick that he threatens the clients with.  REPT\nstated that no one has actually seen him do this but have heard\nhim threatening clients.  Several people called REPT and told\nher that ALV had bruises on his lower back, a mark on his upper\nleft arm, looks like a grab mark.

ALV was quite disoriented and\nsuffering from some hypothermia.  ALV was seen at the ER.\nBody temperature was 95.  ALV has some infection in his\neyes and scratches on his arms.\nB.  Class member abuse in community homes is much worse than in facilities.\nIn contrast to the examples of abuse that took place in vendor-operated homes in the\nrecent past, the overwhelming majority of substantiated claims of abuse at facilities is the result\nof falls, usually from wheelchairs, or out of bed, or because the Class member was not closely\nsupervised.  One Class member went “awol” from a facility for one hour – a far cry from the\nthree reports summarized above where the individuals were gone for hours, including overnight,\nwith caregivers who apparently did not notice or care.  The abuse against DMR clients in\ncommunity homes is the result of malfeasance – it is conduct that is intended to cause harm, or\nrepresents gross recklessness in the care of individuals who need to be constantly monitored in\norder to be safe from themselves, other clients, or abusive staff.\nC.  DPPC fulfills its mission despite budget cuts.\n   In 1993, the year this Court entered the Disengagement Order, the DPPC hotline received\n3,293 calls.  In 2004, the hotline received 5,979 calls – an increase of more than 80%.5  At a time\nwhen its call volume set a new record, DPPC was forced to reduce its staff by 21%.  As a result,\nDPPC staff investigated only 5% of the abuse complaints, and referred the others to other state\n5 DPPC 2004 Annual Report, p. 4, Ex. 3.\n17\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 18 of 58\nagencies for investigation.  In fact, the DPPC referred out more than 60% of abuse reports to the\nDMR to investigate.  While the referrals to the DMR are the result of practical necessity, it is\ndifficult for any entity to police itself as strictly as would a third party.  The increase in calls to\nthe DPPC hotline correlates with the DMR’s increased reliance on POS vendors as direct care\nproviders – outsourcing has its price.\n  The DPPC determined that the abuse allegations in 880 of the complaints it processed in\n2004 involved conduct that is criminal in nature.  Of these complaints of criminal conduct, 42%\ninvolved physical violence, and 40% involved sexual assaults, and 11% involved larceny.6\nGiven that approximately one out of four DMR clients is a Class member, it is quite likely that\nmore than 200 Class members were victims of a crime in the recent past.  Criminal charges were\nbrought in 130 cases, including the following:\nJune 2004 investigation of sexual assault on a 42 year old woman with\ndevelopmental disabilities, who is both deaf and non-verbal.   The suspect, the\nvan driver who drove the woman to and from work every day, admitted that he\nwould pull the van over at a soccer field on the way back to the woman’s home\nand have sexual intercourse with her.  He admitted that he raped on five\nseparate occasions.7\nThe DPPC also investigated 23 deaths, and substantiated that five of the deaths were the\nresult of abuse.8  Four other death investigations are “pending.”  The State Police Detective Unit\nassists the DPPC in its investigations and reviews all complaints to identify criminal conduct.9\nAccording to the Commander of the State Police Detective Unit at the DPPC, cases that are\nforwarded to local police or the district attorneys’ offices to consider criminal charges are\n6 Id. at p. 12.\n7\nId. at 15.\n8 Id. at 5.\n9 Id. at 11.\n18\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 19 of 58\nclassified as “pending” or “open” cases.  There is no hyperbole in stating that DMR clients are\ndying at the hands of their caregivers.\nD.  DMR Views Results Through Rose-Colored Glasses.\nCurrently, more than one-quarter of all abuse, neglect or mistreatment allegations\ninvestigated by the DPPC are substantiated.  That means that hundreds of individuals receiving\nservices from DMR and its POS vendors are being abused, neglected or mistreated.  Even more\ncompelling is the fact that the DPPC’s substantiation rate was 22% in fiscal years 2000-2002.10\nDPPC’s 2004 Annual Report notes that there were 1,779 claims of abuse investigated that year,\nof which 252 were substantiated in 294 were “pending.”11  If the “pending” cases are removed\nfrom the total, the substantiation rate for 2004 would have been 27%.  If all “pending” cases\nfrom 2004 were counted as substantiated, the DPPC’s substantiation rate would have been 31%.\nEither way, the substantiation rate has increased significantly from the stable 22% rate in the\nearly 2000s.\nThe DPPC data is quite damning.  DMR, however, takes a different view of the situation.\nLast year, DMR released its first ever Quality Assurance Report.  The DMR Quality Assurance\nReport (“DMR QA Report”), Ex. 2, covered fiscal years 2002-2003 (the same years that were the\nsubject of Wrentham Association’s public records request to DPPC), and it contends that the\nnumber of substantiated complaints of abuse has shown a “somewhat steady decline.”  The\nDMR, however, failed to include the number of open investigations in its calculations.\nIn 2002, the DPPC investigated 1,351 complaints, and substantiated 431 of them.  Forty\ncomplaints are still open.  In 2003, DPPC investigated 1,257 complaints, and substantiated 358\n10 See DPPC Combined Annual Report 2000-2001-2002, at 10, Ex. 4.  The table of data relied upon to calculate the\nsubstantiation rates identified the rate as 262 claims substantiated out of 1,171 investigations in 2000; 302 claims\nsubstantiated out of 1,369 investigations in 2001; and, 331 claims substantiated out of 1,493 investigations in 2002.\n11 DPPC Annual Report at 7, Ex. 3.\n19\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 20 of 58\nof them, but the QA Report notes there are still 109 open complaints.  To its credit, the DMR\nnoted that the large number of open complaints contributed to the lower substantiation rate in\n2003.  DMR also recognizes that “the vast majority of open cases are those that were deferred to\nlaw enforcement agencies,” and that the DPPC has placed an increased emphasis on referring\ncases out for prosecution.12  Had the DMR treated the “open” or “pending” cases as\nsubstantiated, the substantiation rates would have been 35% and 37% for 2002- 2003, at least\naccording to the information set forth in the DMR QA report.13  These rates are comparable to\nthe 38% substantiation rate for 2001 cited in the DMR QA Report.\nAdditionally, the substantiation rates should not be viewed in isolation.  DMR likely\nchose to focus on the substantiation rate because it masks the increasing numbers.  The call\nvolume to DPPC has increased every year, such that it is conducting more investigations.  Even\nif the substantiation rate is stable, more DMR clients are being victimized.  DMR should not be\nallowed to hide its head in the sand any longer.  Something is critically wrong with this service\nsystem, and DMR must do more to protect Class members and all of its clients.\nAnother example of the positive spin that DMR seeks to cast on bad news is reflected in\nits discussion of why “critical incident reports” doubled between 2001-2003 (12.3 reports per\n1000 served in 2001 versus 27.3 reports per 1000 served in 2003).14  Such reports are filed when\nthere are “unusual incidents that place individuals at risk in order to provide DMR with a\nmechanism to track incidents and assure appropriate corrective actions are taken.”15  Incidents\n12 DMR QA Report at 16.\n13 Neither the 2001 substantiation rate nor the total number of investigations for that year, set in Table 4, at p. 15 of\nthe DMR QA Report match the data presented in the DPPC’s report covering 2001.  It may be that DMR is\nproviding information only on the investigations it performs on behalf of the DPPC, since the DPPC’s staffing has\nbeen cut repeatedly in recent years.\n14 DMR QA Report at 20-21.\n15Id. at 18-21.\n20\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 21 of 58\nassociated with “inappropriate behavior,” (a euphemism for sexual contact), criminal activity,\nassault, and accidents were the most frequent subjects of critical incident reports for all three\nyears.\nDMR goes to great lengths to rationalize the 120% increase in the rate of critical reports\nbetween 2001 – 2003.  DMR repeatedly states that the increase in these reports is most likely\nbecause an increased emphasis on reporting, “not actual changes in the frequency of real\nincidents.”16  Even if that were true, that distinction provides no comfort to Class members, since\nit means that these types of incidents, including inappropriate sexual contact and physical abuse,\nhave always been occurring – but that it is only recently that this misconduct has been reported\nto DMR.  At least now the incidents are reported, but that does not guarantee that DMR will\nactually take steps remedy the problem.\nD.  Criminal Background Check Violations.\n  It is worth repeating that direct care providers have the most access to, and control over,\ncommunity home residents.  It is for this reason that criminal background checks are required for\nall employees who will be providing services to this at-risk population.  Yet the number of\naudited providers with CORI violations has increased, and the violations are confined to a small\ngroup of POS vendors.  There were 20 vendors with a total of 200 violations – that means that\nvendors could not prove that they had run the CORI background checks on 200 direct care\nworkers.  The DMR QA Report is silent on whether DMR required those 20 vendors to verify\nthat the 200 employees are, in fact, cleared to work with such a sensitive population.  DMR’s\nlack of follow-through demonstrates a systemic failure in protecting residents, including Ricci\nclass members, from harm.\n16 Id. at 20.\n21\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 22 of 58\n  In another example of DMR taking a very optimistic view of its findings, it states that the\nvendors’ inability to document that it performed CORI checks “does not necessarily mean that a\nCORI was not requested and completed.”17  Unfortunately, even if CORI checks are done, they\nmay be of limited value.  In February 2005, the Massachusetts Inspector General faulted the\nprocess that social service agencies, including the DMR, use to check criminal backgrounds.\nDuring the ten year period reviewed, there were 284 reported cases of abuse in which the abuser\ndid not live in Massachusetts.18  State agencies only check on applicants’ criminal records in\nMassachusetts, so anyone with a criminal record in a surrounding state would escape review.\nE.  DMR Hides Behind Unfounded “Confidentiality” Concerns To Stonewall\nInquiries.\nDMR wants Class members, their guardians, Class counsel, and this Court to believe its\nstatements that staffing is “adequate” and that despite the deep budget cuts and challenges the\nagency faces, it is meeting its obligations under the Disengagement Order.  It would be easier for\nthe DMR if no one tried to test those statements by looking at documents or statistics it\nmaintains.  The House Committee on Post Audit and Oversight Bureau (“HPAOB”) conducted a\nmulti-year review of DMR, with a report released in 1997.  The review was precipitated, in part,\nby two high-profile cases in which individuals who received services from DMR lived in squalor\nand subjugation while their “caretakers” lived off their SSI checks, and two other cases in which\nindividuals with mental retardation died while in DMR’s care – one drowned and the other\nchoked to death on his diaper. The HPAOB concluded:\nDMR protects itself from public scrutiny and from accountability by delay tactics\nand asserting confidentiality of DMR clients and client records to prevent\noversight of its actions.  DMR has used confidentiality of clients and client\nrecords as a means of making oversight of the agency extremely difficult.  DMR’s\n17 DMR QA Report, 18.\n18Boston Globe, Feb. 24, 2005, IG Faults Screening of Caregivers.\n22\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 23 of 58\nmethods of operations, particularly their excessive and subjective redaction of\ndocuments and delays of document production, make identifying systemic\nproblems difficult and tremendously time consuming. . . . The Department’s\ncurrent regulations on the creation, maintenance, destruction, and access to\nrecords, 115 CMR 4.00 et seq., take client confidentiality to the extreme.  This\nultimately allows them to hide poorly done work, and results in client safety being\njeopardized.19\nUnder Commissioner Morrissey’s leadership, the DMR has been much more responsive\nto bothRicci stakeholders and other state or legislative entities with oversight responsibility.\nYet, DMR continues to deny stakeholders access to the most basic information, contrary to the\nrequirements of the Disengagement Order.  For example, Karen Mutanen, a Ricci class member\nwho left Wrentham in 1979, was found dead, with her mother who was also dead, in a trash-\ninfested house in West Roxbury in 2000.  Karen’s cause of death is still unclear.  Many\nWrentham Association members believe that Karen’s mother died first, and that Karen\neventually died because she did not know how to care for herself.  Karen didn’t die from abuse,\nor because of a medication error.  Nevertheless, DMR likely has some culpability in her death.\nKaren never received any services or medication from DMR in the years prior to her death\nbecause DMR claimed that her mother refused services in 1986.  DMR apparently never made\nany other attempt to contact Karen after 1986 to determine if there was a need or desire for\nservices.\nEven if Karen had refused services in 1986, DMR’s policy of ignoring Class members for\nyears after services are refused violates the Disengagement Order.  DMR is required to\nsubstantially care for Class members for the rest of their lives.  Following Karen’s death, the\nWrentham class representative asked DMR for a copy of the letter in which Karen’s mother\nrefused services.  DMR refused to provide it – claiming confidentiality.  In July, 2000, Class\n19 Report on the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation:  An investigation by the House of\nRepresentatives Post Audit and Oversight Bureau, including “Are you sure about this guy?”  An analysis of the\nabuse of two mentally retarded men in Raynham, Massachusetts (1997) at 19.\n23\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 24 of 58\nCounsel formally requested the letter.  DMR responded three months later – admitting that it was\n“not in possession” of a letter from Karen or anyone acting on her behalf, refusing DMR\nservices.  DMR took the position that class counsel was not entitled “to inspect the records of a\ndeceased DMR consumer.”  Ex. 5.  DMR eventually provided a redacted hand-written note from\nKaren’s mother apparently in response to a service coordinator’s request for a “progress note” on\nKaren.  Nothing in that letter could be read as refusal of services.  Indeed, Mrs. Mutanen wrote,\n“Due to a back injury, I need help.”  This is another example of DMR hiding behind\n“confidentiality” to prevent disclosure of its error, and Karen Mutanen fell through the cracks\nand died as a result.\nII. DMR Does not Provide Adequately Trained and Experienced Personnel in Vendor-\nOperated Group Homes.\n  Pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) of the Disengagement Order, DMR is required to provide\n“[s]ufficient adequately trained and experienced personnel . . . to substantially meet the needs set\nforth in each class member’s ISP.”  DMR is not complying with this provision because it and its\nvendors have failed to provide adequate salaries and benefits to the staff who care for Class\nmembers.  There is no escaping the effect of inadequate resources.  There are systemic\ndeficiencies in the provision of care, including escalating turnover among POS vendors,\ncontinuous vacancies in staff positions, decreasing levels of service, and significant risk of\npersonal harm and injury to Class members.  These problems will only be magnified as Class\nmembers continue to age and develop increased therapeutic and medical needs.\nA.  DMR staff cuts have decreased Class member services.\nThe percentage of DMR’s own professional staff such as counselors and speech and other\nallied health therapists is relatively small given the many thousands of DMR clients, including\nClass members.   According to the 2004 listing of staff and budget codes for the DMR, fewer\n24\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 25 of 58\nthan 50 full-time equivalent psychologists are available to support the entire population and only\napproximately 18 of the psychologists are PhD level professionals.  There are fewer than 23\nallied health therapists, most of whom are occupational therapists.  The sheer numbers (e.g. 50\nfull-time psychologists for 10,000 individuals) demonstrate that the staffing levels are inadequate\nand only getting worse.\nThe caseload for human service coordinators (“HSC”) is also quite high, as described in\nthe letter filed on behalf of the Service Employees International Union, Local 509 (“SEIU”) in\nthis case one year ago.  DMR describes service coordinators as the “first line of quality\nassurance” and the means by which it provides accountability and oversight for the care provided\nto Class members.  Service Coordinators now carry caseloads in the 50’s, covering individuals\nwho are widely dispersed.  They also prepare ISPs.  A number of Wrentham guardians have\nprovided counsel with copies of their wards’ ISPs.  Some do not even include a reference to the\nfact that the person is a Ricci Class member, so apparently many of the service coordinators\nthemselves do not understand that DMR is responsible for all care, at no cost to the Class\nmember or guardian.\nDMR itself agrees that there is a pressing need to recruit, train, hire and retain qualified\nstaff in the POS system, yet continues to claim that current staffing is “adequate.” 20  This\nposition is nonsensical – if current staffing levels are adequate, then there would be no pressing\nneed to recruit, train and retain qualified staff.  DMR’s assertion of the adequacy of staffing\nlevels is based on the periodic reviews it conducts, but DMR has declined to provide the\nWrentham Association with that information due to “privacy concerns.”  While DMR has made\n20 Marianne Meacham, DMR General Counsel, July 1, 2004 letter to Attorney Lisa Goodheart, Wrentham Class\nCounsel, at 6, Ex. 6.\n25\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 26 of 58\nefforts to recruit staff through advertising and other means, such efforts will not address the\nproblem, because it is based on inadequate salaries, not lack of recruitment efforts.\nEven as it experiences difficulty in recruiting and retaining employees, DMR continues to\neliminate positions.  Since 1993, due to continued budget constraints, DMR direct care staff have\nalso been cut back.  The SEIU states that 543 personnel reductions have taken place, including\n162 reductions plus 225 early retirements offered and accepted in FY2002 followed by an\nadditional loss of 156 staff members who accepted early retirement in 2003.  In 2004, DMR\neliminated 20 non-supervisory HSCs, leaving approximately 380 to serve a population of\napproximately 34,000 individuals and their families.  Service coordinators are supposed to serve\nas the safety net for Class members.  Given how far they are stretched by dangerously high\ncaseloads, it is not surprisingly Class members fall through the cracks.\nB.  High turnover rates make the understaffing problem worse.\n  Turnover is a well-documented concern with service providers, and is a direct result of\nlow compensation.  Turnover among direct care workers is 40% nationally and up to 50% in\nsome places.21  Contributing to this problem is competition from other service-related industries\nsuch as restaurants, hotels, travel and telemarketing, which can provide higher pay and less\nstress.22  With wage rates as low as $9.50 per hour, it is not surprising that “[s]ervice providers\noften compete with McDonalds and Wal-Mart for workers, resulting in a work force that is not\nonly transient but also less apt to bring basic literacy skills to the job.”23\n21 James Stergios, “Social Services Network Needs Tune Up,”Boston Herald, May 20, 2002 at 21.\n22 Amy Hewitt and Susan Ormell, “People Need People: The Direct Service Workforce,” Impact Vol. 10, No. 4, pg.\n1 (The College of Education and Human Development, University of Minnesota, Winter, 1998).\n23 James Stergios, “Social Services Network Needs Tune Up,”Boston Herald, May 20, 2002 at 21.\n26\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 27 of 58\n  Average turnover rates in private community residential settings are from 57% to 71%\nper year nationwide.24  “In addition to effecting service quality and consumer satisfaction, high\nturnover rates increase costs, decrease quality of communication between staff, decrease\ncontinuity of supports, increase administrative costs, increase job stress, reduce productivity and\nsatisfaction, and lead to staff shortages.”25  Fundamentally, “[t]here is a national crisis in\nsecuring an adequate supply of qualified direct support professionals, and the inability to recruit\nand retain qualified direct support workers threatens the fulfillment of the national promises\nmade [by] law, and in judicial and regulatory interpretations of those laws.”26  The problem is\ncaused by low salary, wages and compensation.  Studies of this crisis “found that private\ncommunity agency wages for direct support professionals equal three-quarters (75%) of those of\nstate employees in the same roles and barely half (55%) of the state’s average wage.”27  Despite\nthis, most states, including Massachusetts have only made modest efforts to increase\ncompensation, and even these improvements have been rolled back because of budget cuts.\nThus, any progress that had been made after the 1993 Order is being lost.\n  In 1996, the average direct care service wage of $8.06 per hour in Massachusetts was\nbelow the federal poverty guideline for a family of four.28  Although the current workers in\n24 Amy Hewitt and Susan Ormell, “People Need People: The Direct Service Workforce,” Impact Vol. 10, No. 4, pg.\n1 (The College of Education and Human Development, University of Minnesota, Winter, 1998).\n25 Id.\n26 “Shortage of Direct Support Professionals—A Growing Crisis in the Developmental Disabilities Community,” by\nAAMR, available athttp://www.aamr.org/Reading_Room/pdf/direct_support_workforce.pdf.

For example, Tracy Adams, a 22 year old psychology major at\nEmmanuel College, works 40 hours per week at a group home in Newton.  Ms. Adams cares for\nmostly nonverbal men ranging in age from 34 – 58.  As part of her duties, she has to be able to\nlift each man, one of whom weighs close to 200 pounds, from a wheelchair, into the bathtub and\nback.  She also helps to change their diapers, does laundry and helps clean the house.  Ms.\nAdams barely earns $12 per hour (or $25,000 per year), although she is one of the lucky ones\nwho receives health and dental benefits.\nBecause she is the assistant manager, she is paid more than the rest of the staff, who\nmake about $10.00 per hour.31  This pay differential underscores why there is a recruiting and\nretention problem, especially since “[p]roviders of supports and services to individuals with\nmental retardation or other developmental disabilities typically draw from a labor market that\ncompetes with other entry level jobs that provide less physically and emotionally demanding\nwork, and higher pay and other benefits and therefore these direct support jobs are not currently\ncompetitive in today’s labor market.”32\nRecognizing the problem, the Legislature established an additional salary reserve in 2001\nhad a small impact, raising salaries for community workers to between $19,607.00 (direct care\n29 The 2004 Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines are published at Federal Register, Vol.\n69, No. 30,  pg. 7336 (Feb. 13, 2004).\n30Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004 – 2005, The National Data Book, U.S. Dept. of Commerce (124th\ned.

The study found that the turnover rate among POS\ncontractors and homemaker agencies rose from 1997 to 2000.  In 1997, POS contractors had a\nturnover rate of 17.94%, which increased to 25.75% in 2000. 35  The study concluded:\nWages levels tended to be the primary factor influencing\ncontractors’ ability to recruit and retain staff.  Some contractors\nreported they received no responses to advertisements placed in\nnewspapers due to the low starting salaries of their open\npositions.36  Several contractors gave examples of losing staff to\nretail jobs in the community that required less skill, offered high\nsalaries and had less stress. . . . Other contractors gave examples of\nemployees working an additional job in order to increase their\nwages.37\nThe low salaries do not just create a recruiting problem, they also have a very real effect\non care.  One outrageous example from February, 2005 involved a former Wrentham resident,\n33 “Comparison Between the Average Salaries of Direct Support Staff Working State Operated Programs and Those\nWorking Privately Operated Community Programs,” Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers, attached\nhereto as Ex. 9.\n34 Id.\n35 “Outside Section 445 Study of the Impact of Salary Reserve Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 2000,” (January\n2001), Ex. 10, (hereinafter “Outside Section 445 Study”).  The six positions consisted of (1) POS case worker\nmanagers (individuals providing case work and case management services including service eligibility\ndetermination, service coordination and service plan development, resource development and advocacy); (2) POS\ndirect care supervisors (staff members who supervise non-professional and para-professional direct care program\nstaff in performing their program functions; duties which involve significant responsibility for program operations\nand logistics and may provide direct client care); (3) POS direct care workers II (staff with bachelor’s degree\nexperience or specific skills who are responsible for general daily care of clients or for primary program service\ndelivery); (4) POS direct care workers I (staff responsible for general daily care of program clients or for primary\nprogram service).\n36 This is not very surprising considering that in 2000, there were still over 17,000 people who earned less than\n$20,000 per year.

Three of the\ngroup home residents were put in the manager’s office at the Mobil station, while another was\nlocked in the BAMSI van.  A nurse recognized one of the men as someone who was in a day\nprogram with her brother, and notified police.38  The BAMSI employee told police that he had to\nhave two jobs because he earned only $11/hour as a caregiver and he needed more money.39\n Since the Salary Reserve Impact Report was released in 2001, the situation has\ndeteriorated further.  The budgeted salary reserve in FY2002 was only directed to staff earning\nless than $20,000 per year.  Additionally, the Commonwealth has not allocated any cost of living\nincreases to reflect increases in utilities, insurance and rent since the 1980s.  Nor has there been a\nreserve to address the spiraling costs of healthcare in the last few years.  Far from getting better,\nthe crisis will continue to worsen because the FY 06 Budget included another $20 million salary\nreserve that only passed over the Governor’s veto.40  However, the 19-cent pay increase that it\nwill probably give is not likely to make a significant difference in the continued personnel\nshortage.41  A lack of any substantial change will continue to interfere with DMR’s ability to\nprovide sufficient adequately trained and experienced personnel and will continue to interfere\nwith DMR’s ability to provide required services to each class member on a life-time basis, all of\nwhich are required by the Order.\n38Patriot Ledger, March 1, 2005.\n39Patriot Ledger, March 2, 2005\n40 H.4200, 184th Gen.

Inadequate staffing and experience levels  harm Class members.\nIn addition to creating staffing shortages, high turnover creates major problems with\ntraining and experience.  First, it takes time and resources to train new people to perform the\nwork and to care for individuals, including the Class members.  High turnover directly impacts\nthe level of experience of care workers because fewer and fewer stay on the job long enough to\ngain the requisite experience.  As a DMR official stated “about 30 percent of direct-care workers\nlast less than 18 months on the job.”42\nHigh turnover directly affects Class members by failing to provide them with care\nworkers with whom they are familiar.  This is important because a number of the Class members\nfare much better when dealing with care workers with whom they have developed a personal\nrelationship.  This issue, while rooted in common sense, is also explicitly addressed in many\nISPs.   The lack of experienced, qualified staff jeopardizes Class members’ physical well-being.\ni.  Medication errors are a symptom of DMR’s failure to provide\nadequately trained staff.\nIn addition to the general concerns regarding staffing, other issues about quality of care\nrevolve around a lack of regulations and licensing requirements.43  One of the most critical areas\nrequiring trained staff involves the administration of medication.  DMR’s record on this issue is\ndismal.   In 1988, the Massachusetts State Auditor disclosed that unlicensed and untrained\nindividuals were administering medication to consumers in community-based programs overseen\nby both the Department of Mental Health (“DMH”) and DMR.44  Thus, in 1993, the Department\n42Patriot Ledger, Special Reports, High-level Responsibility, Fast-Food Pay, March 23, 2004.\n43 Lutsky, et al (2000), as cited in “Cost Comparisons of Community and Institutional Residential Settings:\nHistorical Review of Selected Research,” Reprinted from Mental Retardation, Vol. 41, No. 2, April 2003, pg. 116.\n44 “Independent State Auditor’s Report on the Administration and Oversight by the Departments of Public Health,\nMental Health, and Mental Retardation of the Medication Administration Program at 48 Community Residences and\n12 Human Service Providers,” September 28, 2001 (hereinafter “Sept. 28, 2001 Report”), Introduction, Ex. 11.\n31\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 32 of 58\nof Public Health promulgated 105 C.M.R. 700.003, authorizing non-licensed individuals to\nadminister medication, if certain requirements were met, including successful completion of the\nMedication Administration Program (“MAP”), which provided training and certification to direct\ncare staff working in residential programs.  This program, however, has serious deficiencies.\nSpecifically, in 1998, the MAP Advisory Group expressed concern over the appropriateness of\nthe MAP curriculum and the lack of independence of the certification test, because each state\nagency certified its own staff.45  The Advisory Group recommended that an independent\nconsultant be hired to develop a new curriculum and administer the test.  In September 1999, the\nnew curriculum was implemented, consisting of only twelve (12) hours of training provided by\nregistered nurses and pharmacists.  This training is inadequate and raises serious safety concerns.\nIn 2001, the State Auditor conducted a survey of other states, seven of which responded\nwith useable data, and found that Massachusetts is the only state that authorizes unlicensed\nindividuals to administer medications without supervision.  Some states with similar programs\nrequire much stricter training and continuing education requirements than Massachusetts.  Of the\nseven states that responded with useable data, all required unlicensed individuals to be\nsupervised to some degree by a licensed professional.  Additionally, six of the seven required\nsignificantly more training hours than Massachusetts.  Oregon, for example, required eighty (80)\nhours.46  The Massachusetts Nursing Association expressed concern to the Auditor that MAP\ngives direct care staff members responsibilities that are usually limited to professionals with a\nclinical background, but direct care staff are not given the training, nor do they have the\nexperience, to recognize adverse reactions to medications.47  One nurse who teaches the\n45 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 4.\n46 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 27.\n47 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 27.\n32\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 33 of 58\ncertification course said that many workers don’t know enough English to understand the\nmaterial, much less pass the test.48  In 2003, less than half of the applicants passed the\ncertification test on their first try.\nThe Commonwealth’s House Post-Audit and Oversight Bureau (“HPAOB”) conducted a\nreview of medication administration and identified several areas of concern including that the\nnumber of Medication Occurrence Reports (“MORs”), which are supposed to be completed for\nany error in medication, was in all likelihood understated, because direct care staff would likely\nnot want to jeopardize their employers’ contracts with DMR.49  Issues such as staff turnover and\nconfusion about what constitutes an “incident” can also lead to underreporting.  In addition, “the\npersonnel assigned responsibility for the administration of medication to clients may be\ninadequate given the low salaries and continuing problems with staff turnover.”50  The Audit\nconcluded that the oversight, training and turnover issues in this area are significant and long-\nterm.51\nAdditionally, MORs were not effectively utilized to ensure that individuals who made\nmedication administration errors were identified and properly trained to prevent future\nmedication errors.52  One of the most stunning revelations of the audit was DMR’s admission\nthat it did not have procedures for monitoring the training that providers give to direct care staff,\nand it therefore cannot determine whether individuals who commit medication errors received\nadditional training to prevent future errors.  In response to the Auditor’s recommendation that the\nDepartment improve its oversight of the MOR process, DMR stated “[w]e believe that the report\n48Patriot Ledger, Medicine, Language Collide, March 22, 2004.\n49 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 6.\n50Id.\n51 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 6.\n52 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 9.\n33\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 34 of 58\nfails to give due consideration to the primary goals of the MOR system, which are to create a\nnon-punitive environment conducive to the reporting of complete and accurate information and\nutilize MOR data for retrospective analysis.”53\nRetrospective analysis is a nice academic exercise, but preventing medication errors is\nmuch more important to Class members.  DMR’s response to the monitoring/oversight\nsuggestion is very disappointing since it appears that DMR was not concerned enough about\nmedication errors to take any action to try to prevent them from recurring.  It seems pointless to\nhave a system to “monitor” medication administration if DMR makes no effort to respond to\nerrors that are potentially life-threatening.  With all due respect to DMR, a direct care worker\nwho makes a medication mistake should be reprimanded if appropriate, and required to undergo\nadditional training.\nClass members have died as the result of medication errors and DMR’s intransigence on\nthis issue is a prime example of a systemic failure.  Specifically, in 2002, David Malcolm, a\nresident of a community program on the South Shore, died after the manager of his community\nhome failed to fill his prescription for medication to control his seizures.  David’s doctor gave a\nstronger prescription to the group home manager on December 11, 2002.  It was never filled.54\nBy late December, his other prescription ran out and he missed three doses.  On December 29,\n2002, David collapsed at 4 a.m.  The house manager decided to wait until more staff arrived to\nbring him to the emergency room, although a doctor recommended that he be seen.  David had\nanother seizure at 6 a.m.  The manager did not respond to a page, and there was apparently only\none staffer on duty.  Shortly after 8 a.m., the staffer heard another crash and found David lying in\n53 Sept. 28, 2001 Report, at 14.\n54Patriot Ledger, David Malcolm Timeline, March 20, 2004.\n34\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 35 of 58\nthe bathroom, bleeding from the nose and forehead, shaking and biting his tongue.55  The staffer\ncalled 911 and David was taken to South Shore Hospital, where he had more seizures and\nsuffered cardiac arrest.  He died on January 4, 2003 at age 39.56\nRachel Deline, a Wrentham Class Member, also suffered and died because of medication\nerrors.  On April 13, 2002, a pharmacist who filled her prescription accidentally gave her double\nthe dose of lithium that was prescribed to control her mood swings.  She developed diarrhea, a\nsymptom of lithium poisoning that went unnoticed.  Her doctor told staff it was probably a virus,\nand the group home manager told staff to limit her fluids, which increased the risk of\ndehydration.  The diarrhea continued and Rachel soon became weak and unsteady.  Noticing a\nbruise on her back, staffers brought her to the doctor for x-rays on May 10, 2002.  There was\nnothing wrong with her back, though she had to be carried into the office.  On May 11,her\nparents came from New Hampshire for their monthly visit.  When they arrived, the staff were all\nwatching television.  Rachel’s father found her moaning and crying, with half her body on a\ncouch and the other half on the floor.  The DPPC investigator subsequently determined that she\nhad been in that condition for 90 minutes.  She died, on May 13, 2002 at age 51, of dehydration\nand kidney damage.57\nii. Staffing deficiencies are accompanied by increased utilization of\nemergency restraints.\nA disturbing trend noted in DMR’s QA Report is that the percentage of individuals in\ncommunity settings subjected to emergency restraints has steadily increased over time.  An\nemergency restraint occurs when a direct care provider limits the resident’s freedom of\n55 Id.\n56Patriot Ledger, David Malcolm Timeline, March 20, 2004.\n57 Sue Reinert,No One Punished for Woman’s Death, and Her Family Asks, “Why Not?” The Patriot Ledger, March\n22, 2004.\n35\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 36 of 58\nmovement through the application of either a mechanical restraint, such as Velcro wrist, leg or\nbody restraints; physical bodily contact, such as a direct care provider grabbing the resident’s\narms or legs to force stillness; or the administration of a non-consensual use of medication – such\nas a tranquilizer injection.58\n  DMR, and all reasonable people, agree that emergency restraints are to be avoided if\npossible.  The fact that restraint usage is increasing in community-based homes raises a huge red\nflag – but at the same time, it could almost have been predicted.  Use of emergency restraints has\ntraditionally been higher in facilities because facility residents are less able to function in an\nappropriate way because of their disabilities –  almost half of facility residents have behavior\ndisorders.  In 2001, the rate of restraint in DMR facilities was 50% higher than in community-\nbased homes.59  By 2003, the rate of restraint in community-based homes had risen to 5.7%,\nwhile the emergency restraint rate in the facilities decreased to 5.9%, such that the rates are\nessentially equal.  What is disturbing about this trend is the fact that community residents are\ntypically much more capable of appropriate behavior, therefore, one would expect that there\nwould be less of a need for emergency restraint.  However, direct care workers in the community\nsorely lack training and experience, so it is not surprising that they are less able to observe and\nrecognize cues or signals that the resident is becoming upset or otherwise acting in a manner that\nmay escalate to behavior that will be subject to emergency restraint.  These staff members are\nlikely unable to defuse situations with less intrusive interventions.\nThe problems in vendor-operated homes do not have a simple solution, although\nincreased funding would certainly be a step in the right direction.  DMR’s failure to critically\n58 115 CMR 2.01.\n59 DMR QA Report, Table 18, page 32 (population restrained at facilities was 6.3%, compared to 4.2% in\ncommunity), Ex. 2.\n36\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 37 of 58\nevaluate care provided in vendor-operated community homes has contributed to its willful\nignorance of the deficiencies in the system.  DMR faces staffing-shortages and training concerns,\nhigh turnover rates, and salary deficiencies.  Absent a major overhaul of the community care\nsystem, DMR is incapable of providing sufficient, adequately trained personnel.  Additionally,\nDMR’s plan to close the ICFMRs and transfer Class members to vendor-operated community-\nbased homes will only add more individuals to an already overwhelmed and short-staffed\nsystem, resulting in services that are not equal or better to the care Class members were receiving\nin 1993, in violation of this Court’s Order.\nIII. DMR(cid:182)s Surveys Do Not Comply with the Periodic Review Requirement.\nThe Court ordered “within nine months of the date of this Order, defendants shall enter\ninto an agreement with contracted retardation professionals or with a nationally recognized\nevaluation group to review community programs on a periodic basis.”   DMR is not in\nsubstantial compliance with this requirement of the order.   In order for DMR to comply with its\nobligations to Class members, periodic review should include the following factors: independent\nreviewers; regular and consistent periods of review; community focused reviews of whether\nClass members’ needs, as set forth in their ISPs, are being met; and appropriate follow up.\nDMR currently uses the services of Human Services Research Institute (“HRSI”) and the\nNational Core Indicators (“NCI”) consumer survey tool.  DMR staff, however, perform the data-\ngathering function by administering the NCI tool and conduct the in-person interviews with\nindividuals and their families.  DMR’s role in the review process compromises the goals of the\nreview ordered by the Court.  Furthermore, the HSRI studies and the NCI tool aggregate data for\nthe purpose of identifying systemic issues and trends, which shape DMR policies and priorities.\n37\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 38 of 58\nThere is no identifying information in the surveys, and accordingly, it is impossible to rely on\nthat survey tool to identify and respond to the problems experienced by any particular individual.\nFurther, the questions utilized in the surveys are not always appropriate for gathering\ninformation from individuals with mental retardation.60 Specifically, quantitative judgments,\ntime questions, direct comparisons, and abstract concepts are all problematic when interviewing\na person with mental retardation. However, the survey utilizes all of the above types of\nquestions.  For example, the survey asks,  “ Do you work enough hours?,” “On most days, are\nyou usually happy or sad?,” and “Can you be by yourself as much as you want to?”  In addition,\nmost of the questions call for a yes or no response.  People with mental retardation are more\nprone to acquiescence. Therefore, the answers to the surveys may not be accurate. The\nquestionnaire functions more as a satisfaction survey than as an oversight tool.\nThe interviews focus on whether individuals receive support to maintain relationships\nand develop new ones; whether they make choices about their routines and schedules, or develop\nand achieve personal goals.  This is important information for DMR to collect, but it should not\nbe to the exclusion of questions of a more fundamental nature:  Does the Class member receive\nall the physical, recreational or occupational therapy provided for in his ISP?   If the ISP calls for\n1:1 care, is the Class member receiving it?  Is the Class member’s transportation adequate to\nallow him or her to participate in work, or day programs, or recreation?  Has the Class member\nseen a doctor or a dentist within the past 12 months?\n  DMR’s review is also deficient because it is conducted every two years, but the final\nreport for each review cycle is not available until long after the data has been collected.  The\nMassachusetts House Post Audit and Oversight Bureau (“HPAOB”) the HPAOB noted in 1997\n60 W.M.L. Finlay and E. Lyons,Methodological Issues in Interviewing and Using Self-Report Questionnaires with\nPeople with Mental Retardation, Psychological Assessment Vol. 13, No. 3. 319-335 (2001).\n38\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 39 of 58\nthat “DMR’s system of oversight and monitoring is unable to isolate problem cases, move to take\nimmediate protective actions, and remove clients from dangerous situations.”61  The HPAOB\nalso concluded that “DMR’s approach to presumption of competency hinders a true assessment\nof potential risk to clients.”62\nAs a result, directly or indirectly, of the lack of the type of review contemplated by the\nCourt, a number of tragedies have occurred in community programs.  Additionally, stories\nabound about Class members in dangerous situations that could be prevented, or at least\ncorrected, through oversight.  A Ricci Class member was killed in February 2005 when an\nemployee of North Shore ARC was trying to back out of an icy driveway.  The Class member\nwas standing near the car, and was run over when the car began moving backwards.  In the\nDPPC Investigative Report of Rachel Deline’s death from lithium poisoning, the investigator\nnoted that previous reports regarding the site of abuse were “too many to list.”  The tragedy that\nbefell Karen Mutanen—who left Wrentham in 1979 and was later found dead with her mother in\na trash infested house in 2000—might have been prevented if someone at DMR had conducted\nany type of oversight or review of her needs.\nA.  Without any oversight, services have and will continue to decline.\nIn the years after the Disengagement Order was entered, Wrentham Class members began\nto experience frustration with a decline in services in group homes, in addition to instances of\nabuse or neglect.  Requests to DMR for a systematic assessment of care fell on deaf ears.  Recent\nstudies have shown that individuals with mental retardation face problems with access,\n61 Report on the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation:  An investigation by the House of\nRepresentatives Post Audit and Oversight Bureau, including “Are you sure about this guy?”  An analysis of the\nabuse of two mentally retarded men in Raynham, Massachusetts (1997) at 19.\n62 Id.\n39\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 40 of 58\nutilization and quality of healthcare and personal care in community-based settings,63 individuals\nin community settings suffer higher rates of verbal abuse and relatively greater exposure to\ncrime,64 and staff members in community settings generally lack organized approaches and skill\nsets to promote development in the residents of community settings.65  Surveys of Wrentham\nClass members, and the DPPC data, support each of these findings.\ni.  2000 Class Member Survey.\nIn 2000, DMR agreed to participate in a small survey of Class members, largely because\nthere was no way to separate data on Class members from DMR’s aggregate surveys.  The\nsurvey included 26 randomly selected Class members.  Interviewers included DMR staff and\nseveral guardians.  A large percentage of the Class members needed more support:\nCD lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment.  Her mother said she was lonely and\ndepressed, and likely in need of mental health services after she stopped seeing her prior\ntherapist.

At the request of one of her neighbors, she\ntook in a homeless couple and their baby, who stayed for weeks.  CD did not feel that she could\nask them to leave and she feared retribution from the man.  CD doesn’t like her apartment\nbecause it is too far from anything.  She did not appear to have access to transportation on a\nregular or routine basis.  CD’s mother said she used to get 30 hours of direct support per week,\nshe currently had 11 hours per week, and 4 hours of vocational support. Community activities\nseemed limited and sporadic.\nTW had significant emotional/behavioral/psychiatric needs that were not being\naddressed.  His house manager said there used to be a psychologist assigned to the program, but\nthat was no longer the case.\nWB was living in a nursing home, with no ISP in his file.

Staffing at the nursing home was quite low for 60\nresidents:  7 during the day; 5 staff in the evening and only 2 overnight.\n  CS’s involvement in community activities had been impacted by staffing issues.  In the\npast, he went to the Cape, went swimming at a pool of a local university, and participated in\nneighborhood cleanups.  For the past two years, there were minimal community activities.\n  AV was supposed to receive 10 hours of support per week, but the “support” apparently\nwas limited to a weekly phone call or short visit to see if he needed anything.\nAs a whole, the 2000 survey results showed definite needs on the part of the Class\nmembers:  35% were in need of better day programming; 30% had financial issues (paying for\nover the counter medications, Class member and advocate unaware of financial entitlements);\n38% of Class members needed one or more clinical services (psychology, speech therapy,\nphysical therapy, devices); 23% had transportation needs (one woman spent 90 minutes on a bus\neach way to get to her day program).\nThe 26-person survey did not support DMR’s assurance that the system was working, and\nthat service coordinators were adequately monitoring the care Class members received in the\ncommunity.  When asked to explain how such a small survey showed such significant needs, as\nwell as decreasing levels of support given to Class members, DMR responded that these must be\n“isolated incidents” and dismissed the survey sample as too small to be representative of the\nClass as a whole.  Having been rebuffed in their interpretation of the 26-person  survey as being\nindicative that a larger survey of Class members’ care should be done, the Ricci stakeholders\nasked for DMR’s assurance that it would follow up with each of the Class members who\nexpressed a need for more support.  DMR agreed, and eventually assigned one person to be\nresponsible for the follow-up.  Despite repeated requests over the last five years, DMR has not\nprovided any explanation of the steps it took to remedy the service problems experienced by\nalmost half of the small 2000 survey sample.\n41\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 42 of 58\nii.  2005 Wrentham Association Survey.\nAfter the appointment of replacement Class Counsel for the Wrentham Class in 2004,\nDMR refused to provide new counsel with a list of guardians and Class members, citing privacy\nissues.  It was only after this Court ordered DMR to provide the information under a\nconfidentiality order, that it was produced.  The Wrentham Association mailed a questionnaire to\nevery guardian or Class member, if there was no guardian.  The survey numbers are likely\nskewed because dozens of surveys, using the addresses provided by DMR, were returned as\nundeliverable.  Additionally, guardians of Class members who still reside at the Wrentham\nDevelopmental Center represented 50% of the 277 survey respondents.  The results, therefore,\nmay not be representative of the entire Wrentham class since there are more than 850 Wrentham\nClass members, of whom approximately 300 still live at Wrentham.66\nNonetheless, fifteen percent of the respondents said that the Class member had\nexperienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse.  Eight percent said that additional\nsupports/services were needed, and 10% said that the Class members pay for their own\ntransportation services.   A number of guardians were willing to be interviewed and provided\nmore detailed feedback:\nRM’s mother states that he has MassHealth insurance, but dental was eliminated.  The\nClass member was told that he has to pay for his dental care.  RM, who is also blind, wants\nsomeone to spend time with him on the weekend because staff is “too busy.”  Transportation has\nbeen a continuous problem because he has to depend on the MBTA’s “Ride.”  He doesn’t have\nthe funds to pay for a taxi.  The guardian states that the service coordinator is overworked and\ncan’t follow up.  She feels that all planning for the ISP is done before she gets there and that\nlimits her ability to request changes.\n66 The responses from the 140 guardians whose wards reside at Wrentham were strikingly similar.  All but a small\npercentage are quite satisfied with the care provided at the Wrentham Developmental Center, where the staff are\nvery experienced and caring.  It is only fair to commend DMR on the job it and its staff are doing at Wrentham.\nMany guardians expressed great concern at the thought that their children and wards would be subject to a transfer\nin the future.\n42\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 43 of 58\nHC’s guardian is dissatisfied with his day program because it is not challenging enough.\nShe feels ignored/dismissed at the ISP when they discussed this, and is not sure if there have\nbeen any real changes. HC  doesn’t have dental insurance, but has continuing dental needs, so\nthe house mgr. contacts guardian and expenses are paid out of his very small personal account\n(veteran’s stipend).  He also pays for his own bus fare.  Last year a psychiatrist diagnosed HC\nwith Asperger’s Syndrome and recommended a specific type of counseling. Although he\nreceives counseling, it is not of this particular sort.\nMW has difficulties because of  staff turnover – he only recognizes faces and feels\ncomfortable with familiarity. When familiar faces disappear forever he is deeply troubled. There\nis no longer enough funding for a nurse that specializes in Alzheimer’s care.  The prior nurse\nused to help out and train staff and be on call, and her absence is very much felt. The staff are not\nparticularly knowledgeable about Alzheimer’s.\nAJ is the only ambulatory member of his house, so social activities are very limited.  For\na very long time there was no weekend staff licensed to drive the van, so they did not go\nanywhere.  His guardian feels it is very hard to find out information from anyone that works\nthere.  It seems to her that planning for activities and transportation is haphazard.  For a while\ntransportation problems were so bad he wasn’t making it to his day program (the service they\ncontracted was undependable, or something).  The ride was a full hour each way.  Guardian feels\nshe must be responsible for calling the dentist and the foot doctor herself to make sure that AJ\nhas been to appointments.  Staff feels free to reschedule for months later if there is a conflict, so\nhis 4-time a year dental needs are not met (similar for foot doctor).  She feels she must supervise\nhis care to make sure he gets it.  As for staffing levels and training, she says they can’t hang on\nto a house manager at all, and that the ones they have had cover multiple houses and so are often\nnot on-site.  There’s no stability in low-level management.  Guardian once noticed that bed\nlinens were not being changed, and suggested to them that they make a “duty chart.”  Staff is\ndisorganized and don’t seem to have a real plan.  Guardian is dissatisfied with the ISP process\nand feels that it is geared toward other professionals, and that once a year is not effective.\nHowever, she feels that her concerns are acknowledged and taken to heart.  Over the years, many\nservices have fallen by the wayside.  AJ used to receive music, physical, speech, and\noccupational therapy, and now he does not.  He has become much more unstable on his feet now\nthat no one works with him.  The current staff is not qualified to help him with any of these\nneeds.\nPW’s guardian noted high turnover in management, but her only complaint is that service\nwas much more personal, warm, and friendly at Wrentham.  She felt pressured to move PW in\n1995.  Someone called or wrote and told her Wrentham was closing and PW had to move.  She\nfelt she didn’t have a choice.  The facility is fine and adequate and always clean, but because the\nstaff have no relationship with PW, he has at times been destructive (ripped his blinds).  They\ncannot communicate with him, and are impersonal, so they cannot address the behavior.  She\nthinks some of their ideas at the ISP are ridiculous.  For example, they were talking about\nregistering him to vote and getting him involved in church, both of which are far outside his\ncapability.  The staff also rents videos, but none of the occupants can enjoy them and she feels it\nis mostly for the staff entertainment.  She has asked about pool access since he moved ten years\n43\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 44 of 58\nago, because PW enjoyed the warm pool at Wrentham, but nothing has ever come of that in ISP\nmeetings.\nTN lived at a motel from February to May because the house he was living in had a leak\nin the sprinkler system.  Guardian is agitated because filing a complaint to the state takes a long\ntime to see results.  Outside of the house is in poor condition.  The wood boards near the roof\nhave holes in them.  Bees and hornets have made nests up there.  Sometimes they are able to get\ninto the house through the holes.  Guardian wonders who is supposed to take care of that\nproblem and problems of that nature?  She was thinking of asking her husband who is a\nconstruction worker to fix it because nothing has been done.\nPT’s guardian lives in California.  They keep in touch by phone and she visits him a\ncouple times a year.  She is fed up with rent increases.  When she began paying for his rent it\nwas only $200, now it is over $1000.  The staff has no skills in her opinion, and there is a high\nturnover rate.  The new house manager supervises two different homes.  Her time is divided and\ndoes not have concern for both houses.  The communication with the guardians are very poor.\nThere is a lack of continuity of the staff, and they do not know how to take care of him.  For\nexample:  At an annual meeting wards and guardians attend, the staff brought PT to the meeting\nin a heavy jacket and sweater when it was very hot outside.  He was clearly uncomfortable and\nsweating profusely when Guardian saw him there.\nPT has no transportation besides for going to work.  Everywhere else he wants to go,\nGuardian has to drive him.  The staff does not bother to take him anywhere for recreational\npurposes.  PT has to use his own money to buy personal things he needs for hygiene.\nBD lives alone. There is one woman that comes over from 3pm, stays over night, and\nleaves when time for day program. This is fine and her family is thrilled with her care, but that\none woman is the only person that works with BD, so her family must take care of her when her\ncaretaker is ill or on vacation, and they have to miss work to do this.  Guardian has asked staff\nfor relief repeatedly at ISP’s, with no change.\nOne guardian, who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation against the Class\nmember, described how happy she was with the care when he first left Wrentham for a group\nhome.  He had five different kinds of therapists and many opportunities for community\ninteraction.  Someone on the staff used sign language, as does the Class member. The residents\nused to go for ice cream on a regular basis.  Over the years, the therapists disappeared one by\none.  Then the staff shrunk in size, such that there is not adequate coverage if one member of the\nstaff leaves the house for recreational purposes.  None of the staff know sign language.  As the\nguardian put it, the house residents are in “lock-down” once they return from their day program,\nand her ward must feel like a small Russian child living with Americans because he cannot\ncommunicate with his caregivers.\nAnother guardian, age 82, cares for her 42 year old son, who has Downs Syndrome, at\nhome.  Her own health issues are now making that more problematic.  Her son has had his own\nhealth challenges, and required surgery.  His guardian was billed $800 for the cost of what\ninsurance would not cover.  After his surgery, her son was not able to walk long distances, and as\n44\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 45 of 58\na result, they stopped going for walks in the neighborhood.  After her hip surgery, she began to\nuse a motorized scooter.  She would like her son to have one so that they can go around the\nneighborhood and into town again, like they used to, but she can’t afford it.\nThese comments, much like those from a much smaller sample in 2000, buttress the\nconclusion that DMR is not doing all that it can, and all that it is required to do, for Class\nmembers.  Staffing levels are low, and prevent Class members from enjoying the benefits of\nliving in the community.  For example, DC’s ISP states:\n“The physical needs of the residents have increased in the last year, making it difficult for\neveryone to participate in community outings with the current staff/client ratio,” which is 2:7.\n“DC has not attended any community outings due to safety concerns . . .”  “DC enjoys going out\ninto the community to purchase personal items and to eat out at restaurants.  He does make\nchoices as to what he wants to purchase.  Coke is his favorite.”\nWhy is it that guardians are unaware that Class members can access dental care through\nthe facilities, where there are dental clinics, free of charge?  Why are Class members using their\nown funds for transportation?  Why are guardians desperate for respite care but get no relief?\nBecause no one at DMR is providing the necessary information or support.  The service\ncoordinator should be able to address many of the financial issues with a simple phone call, and\nperhaps some advocacy on behalf of a Class member, but this is not happening.  A systemic\naudit is necessary, as it has been more than ten years since the Disengagement Order and DMR\nhas yet to perform an objective evaluation of the services Class members receive in the\ncommunity.   It appears that there is a lot of follow-up to be done.  The anecdotal evidence\nsupports only one conclusion – community care is much worse than it was in 1993, such that it is\nno longer “equal or better.”\nIV.  DMR Has Not Certified (cid:179)Equal or Better(cid:180) Treatment at New Location Since 1997,\nand there are Systemic Deficiencies in ISP Process.\nPursuant to Paragraph 4 of the Order, before a Class member can be transferred, the\nSuperintendent of the transferring school or the Regional Director must certify that the Class\n45\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 46 of 58\nmember will receive “equal or better” services and that all services identified in the ISP are\navailable at the new location.  DMR simply stopped complying with this requirement.  When\nnotified of the deficiencies by Attorney Cohen in April 2002, DMR responded by claiming that\nno specific instances of such a failure were presented.  As explained in Section III, above, as well\nas theReport to the Court filed by Fernald on February 2, 2006, it is virtually impossible to\nprovide such information when DMR hides behind concerns over confidentiality as a reason for\nnot allowing Class counsel to review the records that may support the Plaintiffs’ position.\n  When the certification issue was raised again in April 2004, DMR admitted that it no\nlonger completed the certifications form.  Instead, DMR’s practice starting in 1997 “has\nconsistently been that for Ricci Class members the Facility Director or the Regional Director . . .\ncertifies when signing the ISP that a transferred Ricci Class member’s services meet the “equal\nor better” standard.”67  Such an “implicit” certification, by signing the ISP, does not comply with\nthe Disengagement Order.  In some instances, Class members do not even receive an ISP, in\ndirect violation of applicable law and this Court’s Order:\n  FG was admitted to Wrentham at age 14 due to increasing difficulty managing his\nbehavior at home.  He has a diagnosis of moderate mental retardation, Fragile X Syndrome and a\ndegenerative neuromuscular disorder (Parkinson’s disease).  In 1982 he was placed in a staffed\napartment with his brother, RG, and was later moved in March 1987, August 1987, 1990 and\n1991.  In 1994 he was admitted to the Greenery Nursing Home after being denied readmission to\nWrentham State School.\n  RG’s nursing home case manager made Herculean efforts to convince DMR to provide\nFG with respite care, which when DMR finally did so, was inconsistent and intermittent.  This\nwas first listed as a need before his admission, on his 1994 ISP and was apparently implemented\nin 1997, but inconsistently.  It was again implemented in spring of 1999 after much advocacy on\nthe part of the nurse case manager.  The notes also detail enormous efforts to provide increased\nvisitations with family members, even offering the nursing home van if a respite worker could be\nprovided.  Without the nursing home case manager and the resident’s brother, this Class member\nmay never have seen his other brothers with MR.  The notes detail the excitement FG derived\n67July 1, 2004 letter from Marianne Meacham to Lisa Goodheart and Beryl Cohen at pg. 9, Ex. 6.\n46\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 47 of 58\nfrom these visits – talking for the first time in months or years.  Some staff were unaware that he\ncould speak.\n  In 1999, the nurse case manager discovered FG’s Class status and informed DMR that no\nISP had been done since 1996.  Upon admission to the nursing home, physical therapy and\noccupational therapy (as well as behavioral therapy) were discontinued.  The DMR case manager\nsaid that a nursing home is not able to fund “maintenance” PT and OT.  DMR, however, is\nallowed to do so, particularly for Class members – but did not.\n  Starting in February 1998, FG’s mother asked DMR for assistance in locating a new\nguardian, as she was becoming ill.  Mrs. G died in April or May of 1998.  A new guardian was\nput in place in May of 1999.  In 2001 FG was finally readmitted to Wrentham Development\nCenter after advocacy from his guardian and family.  He is doing very well there, enjoying visits\nwith family and friends, appropriate clinical and support services, and annual ISPs.  FG’s health\ncontinues to decline due to the Parkinson’s disease, but with adequate staffing and supports, his\nlife is much better than before.\nV.  DMR(cid:182)s Closure Policy For ICFMRs Violates Disengagement Order.\nWith the system for providing direct care to Class members in community homes strained\nto the breaking point, DMR’s closure policy will move hundreds more Class members to vendor-\noperated homes that are already under-staffed and are providing a sub-standard level of care\nunder the POS contracts with DMR.  Failure to address these problems will only lead to greater\nshortages, and a continuing violation of this Court’s 1993 Order.\nA.  ICFMRs are appropriate for the residents who are there.\nOn March 12, 2003, Governor Romney announced that the Fernald Developmental\nCenter would be closed, and that “[a]dditional large state institutions may be closed in the\nfuture.”  Class members, or perhaps more appropriately, the guardians and care providers for\nClass members, have never thought that transferring them into a community setting would satisfy\nthe requirements of their ISPs, despite the fact that such moves became very common during the\n1980s and 1990s.  Nonetheless, at a meeting ofRicci stakeholders and counsel held at DMR’s\noffice on March 14, 2003, DMR explained that under the announced policy, large ICFMRs\nwould be closed and DMR would maintain some long-term ICFMR capacity with “smaller”\n47\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 48 of 58\nICFMRs.  Of the six facilities, Fernald, Wrentham and Monson were described as “bigger”\nfacilities, while Glavin, Hogan and Templeton were described as “smaller” facilities.  More than\n25% of Class members still reside in state facilities, and the average age of those Class members\nis 53.68\nThe Class members who still reside in DMR facilities are there for a reason.  The\nguardians who have chosen to have the residents remain in facilities have not made their choices\nbased on whether a particular service model is “outdated” or “unenlightened” as characterized in\nthe public policy debate over facility versus community-based care.  Class members who reside\nat state facilities remain there because the facilities are best able to meet the needs set forth in\ntheir ISPs.  Current residents of ICFMRs have more complex medical needs and are more\nfunctionally impaired.69  Approximately 80% of facility residents in general are severely or\nprofoundly retarded.70  These individuals also tend to present more challenging behaviors than\nthose in community settings – approximately 47% of facility residents have behavior disorders.71\nAs of 2000, DMR estimated that 44% of ICFMR residents need assistance or supervision in\nwalking; 60% need assistance or supervision in dressing; 63% need assistance or supervision in\neating; and 55% need assistance or supervision in using the toilet.  Of Class members who reside\nin ICFMRs, 40% cannot understand simple verbal requests and 62% cannot communicate basic\n68 According to the DMR, there are 4,421Ricci Class members.

As\ncommunity services expanded over the past two decades, the average functioning of individuals\nresiding in facilities has declined, while their average age has increased.74  “Adults with severe\nphysical disabilities are disproportionately represented among persons with severe and profound\nretardation,” and their medical problems include:  “seizures; multiple joint contractures, as in\ncerebral palsy; nutritional problems related to feeding difficulty, such as adults requiring tube\nfeeding . . . and recurrent respiratory problems.  The last-mentioned is the most common cause of\ndeath in this group.”75  Access to medical care in a community-based home is hardly comparable\nto that offered at a facility where medical staff are available 24 hours.\nAdditionally, DMR has not acknowledged the fact that the transfers themselves pose a\ngreat risk of harm to the residents.  Movement to a new residential setting is “a time of increased\nmedical risk for all segments of the retarded population.”76  Moving chronically ill or frail\npatients from one place of care to another is one of the most overlooked and significant sources\n72 Residential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities:  Status and Trends Through 2000 (June 2001),\nResearch and Training Center on Community Living Institute on Community Integration/UAP, College of\nEducation & Human Development, University of Minnesota (Robert W.

Studies increasingly demonstrate that patient\nsafety is jeopardized during transitional care, which is the time period in which a patient transfers\nbetween different locations.78  Medication errors also pose a significant threat to patients during\ntransitions.\nB.  Closing ICFMRs will remove beds when more will be needed.\nDMR is clearly being pulled in multiple directions:  It continues to maintain the facilities\nwhere more than 1,000 Ricci Class members reside, as it has done for decades; it participated in\nthe growth of the community-based residential services model over the past twenty years; and\nhas steadfastly promised Class members that if they leave a facility and accept a placement under\nthe Home and Community-Based Services (“HCBS”) Waiver program, they can return to an\nICFMR in the future if the community placement does not meet their needs.79  While DMR has\nnot always honored this promise and does not always provide a “right to return” letter upon\ntransfer, it has continued to tell Class members that they can return to an ICFMR in the future if\nnecessary.  The right to return has not always been quickly honored:\nPR is a Wrentham Class member.  He lived at home with his family until he was 6 years\nold when he went to live at Wrentham.  PR was one of the first residents to leave Wrentham for a\ngroup home.  His family lives in Hudson and PR was offered a placement in a group home in\ntheir town, seven minutes from their house, along with 7 other residents.  It was run by TILL,\nInc.\n77 Transitional Care for Residents:  A Significant Source of Medical Errors, Annals of Internal Medicine, October 5,\n2004.\n78 Eric A.

Staffing was very poor.  There was insufficient staff to keep ill residents home,\nso they were sent to the day hab.  Weekend staffing was worse.\nIn the 7-8 months he lived at the group home, PR went from 130 lbs. in weight to 80 lbs.\nPR made several trips to the Emergency Room of UMass Medical, accompanied by his parents\nand TILL staff.  He was very ill and it could not be determined why.  Immediately before one\nsuch trip, an LPN asked PR’s mother if she knew that he had ingested a latex glove.  PR’s\nmother had never been told this.  PR’s mother told the ER staff about the glove and after X-rays,\nit was determined that there was another glove still in PR’s system, caught in a difficult place in\nhis bowel, and his inability to pass it was making him desperately ill.  Emergency surgery was\ncontemplated, but attempts were made over the next 6 days to allow the glove to pass through his\nsystem.  An entire roll of toilet paper was also found in PR’s system, which had solidified.  Both\nitems were eventually passed after the 6-day period.  This process had further been hampered by\nTILL staff giving PR the wrong prescription for his condition prior to his hospitalization.\nPR’s parents took him home while they negotiated his return to Wrentham Development\nCenter.  They had been told by then Superintendent Francis Kelley that PR would be allowed to\nreturn if the placement was unsuccessful.  When they went to return PR, however, they were not\nwelcomed and had to fight for this return.  After 3-4 months, PR was eventually readmitted to\nWrentham and transitioned back into Cottage 5, where he still lives today.\nYet, at the same time DMR is making these promises, it is charged with the responsibility of\nimplementing the policy of closing “large” ICFMRs and replacing them with “smaller” versions.\nSomething has to give in this equation; it is simply impossible for DMR to honor its obligations\nto Class members over the next few, or more, decades if there is not enough ICFMR capacity to\nmeet the Class members’ needs.\nAs of November 11, 2004, during a meeting held at the suggestion of the Court, DMR\nindicated that there are only 25 open beds in the ICFMRs.80  DMR’s current maximum facility\ncapacity is approximately 1,185 beds.  Yet, in 2000, there were approximately 1,300 facility\nresidents.81  In planning for the Fernald closure, DMR assumed that 2/3 of Fernald residents\n80 At a quarterly meeting of DMR and Ricci stakeholders held on August 28, 2003, DMR stated that there were 51\nfunded facility vacancies.  The decrease from 51 to 25 vacancies is presumably attributed to the transfers taking\nplace from Fernald to the other facilities.\n81 The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities: 2002 Study Summary, David Braddock et al., Coleman\nInstitute for Cognitive Disabilities, University of Colorado, 2002, at 90, Table 2.4.\n51\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 52 of 58\nwould be transferred into one of the five other facilities, and that the remaining 1/3 would be\ntransferred into a community home.  If one-third of all Class members who currently reside in\nfacilities transfer to community homes, there will still be 770 Class members residing in\nfacilities, and almost 3,700 in community-based homes.\nAfter Fernald is closed, assuming that one-third of the population is placed in\ncommunity-based homes, and that mortality rates stay the same over the next two years, there\nwill be approximately 1,030 ICFMR residents in Massachusetts.  If DMR closes Wrentham next,\nonly a small fraction of the 330 Wrentham residents would be able to stay in an ICFMR.  DMR\nremains silent on how it will comply with the “equal or better” requirement in the\nDisengagement Order while shuffling Class members in and out of the ICFMRs, closing “large”\nICFMRs and shifting to a service model of smaller ICFMRs with fewer beds.\nDMR has been either unwilling or unable to identify the total number of ICFMR beds the\nCommonwealth will have at the end of DMR’s implementation of the policy to close all “large”\nICFMRs and retain a reduced ICFMR capacity.  Yet, after Fernald is closed, DMR’s ICFMR\ncapacity at the other five facilities will be approximately 935.  If Wrentham is closed, the\nCommonwealth’s ICFMR capacity will be reduced to 605.82  Throughout this closure process,\nClass members will have fewer and fewer real options –under DMR’s current planning\nguideline, 2/3 of the Fernald residents will be transferred to other ICFMRS.  The Fernald Class\nmembers will be filling every available bed.\nIf Wrentham is the next facility targeted for closure, the Wrentham Class members will\nnot be able to transfer to an ICFMR– vacancies at Monson, Templeton, Glavin and Hogan will\nopen up only if a resident dies or, even more unlikely at this point in time, if a resident chooses\n82 If DMR closes the third of the “largest” facilities, Monson, the Commonwealth’s ICFMR capacity will be reduced\nto approximately 405.\n52\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 53 of 58\nto move to a community home.  The guardians for the hundreds of severely-to-profoundly\nretarded Class members at Wrentham will not have the option of a transfer that will meet all the\nneeds set forth in the Class members’ ISPs, needs which have been met for decades at an\nICFMR.83  It is clear that the closure plan will take away much needed beds without any\nconsideration for the increasing needs of an aging population.  Of the more than 4,000 Class\nmembers, it is reasonable to expect that as they get older they will encounter more challenges in\nliving in a community-based setting, much like senior citizens in the general population, who\nbecome incapable of living independently, but instead reside in assisted-living facilities or\nnursing homes.\nIn order to adopt prudent planning practices, the DMR should anticipate that the\npercentage of Class members who will ask to return to ICFMRs as they age will increase over\ntime.  It is fair to estimate that the readmission rate for Ricci Class members is likely to be\nconsistent with the national average, which was approximately eight percent (8%) in 2000,\nmeasured against all ICFMR discharges in 1989.84  If anything, the readmission rate will increase\nover time, not decrease, since Ricci Class members are part of the aging “baby boom.”\nThe full impact of the first-wave baby boom generation will begin\nto be felt within the intellectual disability service community\nwithin the next [0-5] years.  This generational cohort will be\nmaking the transition into pensioner-age community services as\nwell as posing new challenges for health and disability service\nagencies. . . . These services also have to be better positioned to\naccommodate the needs of older adults . . . who grow frail due to\nadvanced age or who will be affected by dementia or other\nincapacities.85\n83 Potentially even more devastating is the fact that some Fernald residents will have been transferred to Wrentham –\nand they will have no choice but to pack their bags and move again when Wrentham closes – this time to a\ncommunity home because there will not be ICFMR capacity to absorb the 330 Wrentham residents.\n84 Readmissions in 2000, nationwide, totaled 558.

Davidson, Mortality and Morbidity\nAmong Older Adults With Intellectual Disability: Health Services Considerations, Disability and Rehabilitation,\n1999: Vol. 21, No. 5/6, at 292.\n53\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 54 of 58\nDespite needs increasing, DMR is tasked with eliminating, or at least reducing, the availability of\nmuch needed facilities.  DMR will not be able to comply with the Disengagement Order and\nISPs in the future if it has closed two or three of the largest ICFMRs by the time Ricci Class\nmembers request readmission, whether those requests are made five, ten or twenty years from\nnow.\nThe trend of increasing readmissions to ICFMRS has already started.  For fiscal year\n2000, large state-run ICFMRS were responsible for more than 96% of all readmissions.86\nBetween 1991 –  2000, there was a steady increase in both the number and percentage of\nindividuals with profound retardation among readmissions to ICFMRs nationwide.87  Increasing\nreadmissions “reflects the growing numbers of former residents who have moved to community\nsettings as well as the difficulties those settings have faced in meeting their needs.”88  Of the\nreadmissions to ICFMRS between 1985 – 2000, an increasing percentage of those individuals\nresided at group homes immediately prior to readmission to the ICFMRS (less than 20% of\nreadmissions were from group homes in 1985, increasing to 31% of readmissions by 1998).89\n86 Residential Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities:  Status and Trends Through 2000 (June 2001),\nResearch and Training Center on Community Living Institute on Community Integration/UAP, College of\nEducation & Human Development, University of Minnesota (Robert W.

Aging Class members create additional care needs that cannot be met in\ncommunity settings.\nIfRicci Class members are unable to maintain the functional and medical level of well-\nbeing required to live in a community-based home over the next 10-30 years, DMR will not have\nsufficient ICFMR capacity for their readmission.  Without sufficient ICFMR capacity, DMR will\nnot be able to provide the level of care that is likely to be referenced in Class members’ ISPs in\nthe future, and will violate the Disengagement Order.\nJust as it is inevitable that a certain percentage of Class members will die over the next\nseveral years, 90 it is similarly certain that some Class members who currently reside in\ncommunity homes will become increasingly infirm and need more care than required by their\ncurrent ISP.  DMR itself recognizes that increasing age is associated with more complex needs of\nfacility residents when it states that the “facility death rate is higher because of increased age,\netc.”91  The life expectancy of individuals with mental retardation is increasing – from 59 in the\n1970’s to 66 in 1993 – and is approaching average life expectancy of seventy (70) years in the\nUnited States.92\nIn addition to usual health and care needs of aging patients, additional problems arise\nwith Class members with Down Syndrome.  Among older persons with Down syndrome, the\naging process is accelerated and, unfortunately, the disorder has a chromosomal connection to\nAlzheimer ’s disease.  By age 60, approximately 40% of people with Down syndrome will show\n90 According to the 1999 mortality data relied upon by DMR, the annual rate of death per 1000 facility residents is\n21.  DMR Opposition to Fernald Motion to Reopen; Affidavit of Gail Grossman, Ex. 1, DMR 1999 Mortality\nReview Report.  As such, of the current 1157 facility residents, it is reasonable to assume that approximately 24 will\ndie within the next year.  Underscoring the fact that Class members who reside in facilities are older and sicker than\nthose who currently reside in the community is the comparison of the annual 10.9% death rate among the population\nresiding in community homes.\n91 DMR Opposition to Fernald Motion to Reopen, at 12.\n92 Promoting Healthy Aging, Family Support and Age-Friendly Communities for Persons Aging with\nDevelopmental Disabilities, Report of the 2001 Invitational Research Symposium on Aging with Disabilities, Dept.\nof Disability and Human Development, University of Illinois at Chicago, at 1, Ex. 13.\n55\n\nCase 1:72-cv-00469-JLT   Document 85   Filed 02/07/06   Page 56 of 58\nsymptoms of the Alzheimer’s form of dementia.93  Progressing more rapidly in Down syndrome,\ninitial Alzheimer’s changes include memory loss, both general and visual memory, and behavior\nchanges.94  Its middle stages are marked by a loss of social skills and decline in the ability to care\nfor one’s personal needs.  DMR has already recognized that Class members with dementia\nand/or Alzheimer’s disease require specialized care.  At the Wrentham facility, approximately\nfive percent (5%) of the population has Down syndrome.  Of those with Down syndrome, fifty\npercent (50%) have already developed Alzheimer’s.  Traditionally, all the Alzheimer’s patients\nwere in their own apartment, and even as the numbers have increased, each resident has been\nable to remain in his or her own apartment.  However, this will not be able to continue if DMR is\nallowed to close Fernald and other facilities because there simply will not be enough room.  In\nshort, as they age, Ricci Class members will require more care than they currently need.95\nBefore the 2003 decision to downsize the capacity of the Commonwealth’s ICFMRs,\nDMR forecast its expected needs for ICFMR beds in the future.  It determined that by fiscal year\n2011, DMR would require anywhere from 671-912 beds.  By 2010, the Ricci class will have\ndecreased in size to approximately 4,075 (again, assuming mortality rates are constant).  In ten\nyears, approximately 3,750 people will still be members of the class.  As they age, the\nreadmission rate will be at least the current national average of 8%.  The readmission rate may\ndouble as Class members’ who live into their seventies and eighties will require increased\nmedical care and monitoring.  Even a 10% readmission rate means that DMR will need to\nprovide hundreds of ICFMR beds to Ricci Class members – and it will not have them.

The greater medical and personal care that is\nprovided in ICFMRs is simply not available in vendor-operated group homes.\nVI.  Conclusion.\n  DMR has been placed in an unenviable position.  It must comply with the Disengagement\nOrder, and it seeks to comply with that Order.  Given the current budgetary, organizational and\npolicy constraints imposed upon DMR, it lacks the tools and resources to fulfill its mission, as\nwas the case when this action was first filed.\n  WHEREFORE, the Wrentham Association respectfully requests that the Court restore the\nWrentham action to its active docket for the purpose of compelling the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, through DMR, to comply with the Disengagement Order.\nRespectfully submitted,\n      /s/  Margaret M.

Gen., Boston, MA,\nDavid Ferleger, Philadelphia, PA, for defendants.\nSuzanne Durrell, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, MA, for the U.S.\nMEMORANDUM\nTAURO, Chief Judge.\nTwenty-one years ago, I made my first trip to Belchertown, to see for myself the conditions alleged in a class\naction filed on behalf of the residents there.\nTo put that time frame in some perspective, I point out that the law clerk who accompanied me that day, Mark\nBrodin, is now a tenured professor at the Boston College Law School00a rookie Boston lawyer named Bill Weld\n97\nhad passed the bar less than two years earlier00and Kris Brown, the law clerk now working on these cases, was\n97\nfour years old.\n[*]\nSimilar actions were later filed on behalf of the residents of Fernald, Monson, Dever and Wrentham.  I went to\nsee them all, and the sights, sounds, smells and generally deplorable conditions I witnessed are as vivid in my\nmind today as they were those many years ago.\nBut, thanks to the healthy tenacity and persistence of the parents, friends and counsel of people with mental\nretardation00the enlightened leadership of responsible state and federal officials, and the oversight of the Office of\n97\nQuality Assurance and predecessor Court Monitors00those initial inspection tours became the first steps in a\n97\nprocess that has taken people with mental retardation from the snake pit, human warehouse environment of two\ndecades ago, to the point where Massachusetts now has a system of care and habilitation that is probably\nsecond to none anywhere in the world.\nFor the past two decades, literally thousands of hours have been devoted to fashioning a comprehensive\nremedial program that has included multi-million dollar capital improvements, establishment of a responsible\nprogram of community placement, as well as significant staffing increases geared to meeting the individual\nservice plans and overall needs of those with mental retardation.\nThe result is that, working together, we have created an environment for persons with mental retardation that is\nnow characterized by human dignity and opportunity for growth. And we have done so in a way that consistently\nensured a full measure of value for every tax dollar spent.\nDespite this progress, these institutions and the related programs are, of course, not perfect. More needs to be\ndone. And, most important, all concerned, both in the private and governmental sectors, need to be ever vigilant\nthat we do not permit any erosion of the significant progress that has been made.\n\nGiven this progress, and the demonstrated good will and dedication of Governor Weld to the mission of\nsafeguarding the health, safety and well-being of people with mental retardation, I am today signing a\ncomprehensive Order closing the federal court's oversight of these cases.\nA key factor in my decision to do so is Governor Weld's commitment to make permanent the historic\nimprovements that have been achieved during the past twenty years00a commitment manifested and\n97\nmemorialized by the Executive Order he is issuing today, creating the Governor's Commission on Mental\nRetardation.\nThis Commission will be an independent citizen oversight body whose multi-faceted mandate and authority will\n986 include monitoring the quality and effectiveness of the Commonwealth's programs of services designed *986 to\naddress the wide variety of needs of people with mental retardation.\nThe nine members of the Commission will be selected by the Governor. Three of these members will be\nnominated by the existing Advisory Panel of the Office of Quality Assurance, thereby providing significant input\nfrom those who have been so intimately involved with these cases over the years.\nThe Commission will be served by a full-time Administrator appointed by the Governor. The Administrator will be\na person who has demonstrated knowledge and experience with respect to quality assurance in the delivery of\nservices to people with mental retardation.\nThe Commission will have access to all relevant information concerning people with mental retardation. It will\nserve as an ombudsman to resolve disputes, and it will provide a visible and credible forum to ensure that the\nCommonwealth fully complies with its obligations to its citizens with mental retardation.\nThe Commission will work cooperatively with the Department of Mental Retardation, and will serve as a source of\nvaluable advice to the Commissioner and to the Governor with respect to issues affecting the quality of care for\npersons with mental retardation.\nThis independent citizen task force, having oversight responsibility for monitoring quality assurance, is the first of\nits type in the nation. And Governor Weld is to be commended for his foresight and sensitivity in creating this\natmosphere of citizen inclusion with respect to the critical responsibility for monitoring the efforts of the\nDepartment of Mental Retardation.\nI know that Governor Weld will choose the Commission members and the Administrator with great care. To his\nappointees I repeat something I said in 1982:\nThe retarded have no potent political constituency. They must rely on the good will of those of us\nmore fortunate than they, and the Constitution which controls the manner in which all of us must\nmeet our varied responsibilities.\nRicci v. Okin, 537 F.Supp. 817, 836 (D.Mass. 1982).\nMy hope is that those words will serve as something of a standard for the Commission members and the\nAdministrator as they assume this important public trust.\nAn Order will issue.\nORDER\nAfter notice and hearing, and with the consent of the parties, it is hereby ORDERED:\n1. This Order supplants and replaces each of the consent decrees and all orders of the court in these matters. All\nsuch consent decrees and outstanding orders are hereby vacated and dissolved. These five consolidated cases\nshall be and hereby are closed and removed from the court's active docket.

Defendants shall substantially provide services to each class member on a lifetime basis. The specific services\n987 to be provided to each class member[1] to meet this obligation, *987 and defining this obligation, shall be set forth\nin an Individual Service Plan (\"ISP\") that details each class member's capabilities and needs for services,\npursuant to the regulations governing the preparation of ISP's, as currently set forth in 104 CMR 20, et seq.

Such services shall include, as appropriate for the person, residential programs; day\nprograms; recreational and leisure time activities; medical, psychological, dental and health-related professional\nservices; respite care and crisis intervention services; support and generic services, such as guardianship and\nadaptive equipment services; and transportation services.\nb. Defendants shall not seek to amend, revise, or otherwise modify the ISP Regulations as they affect class\nmembers except upon 60 days written notice to plaintiffs' counsel, with an opportunity for plaintiffs to comment\nupon the proposed changes. Any amendments must leave in place a process that is at least the substantial\nequivalent of the regulations currently set forth in 104 CMR 20, et seq., with regard to the definition of the ISP, the\nindividualized nature of the ISP, the existence of an appeal process, and the principles contained in footnotes 2\nand 3 herein.\nc.

Defendants shall maintain certification of state schools under federal Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396, et seq., and maintain compliance with the Department of Mental Retardation's Title XIX\nobligations with respect to services in the community, for as long as the state participates in those programs for\neach facility or service as to which the state receives Title XIX funds.\ne. Within nine months of the date of this Order, defendants shall enter into an agreement with contracted\nconsultant retardation professionals or with a nationally recognized evaluation group to review community\nprograms on a periodic basis.\n3. a. Defendants shall continue to use the Single Standard Methodology for staffing state schools for five months,\nor until the implementation of an alternative staffing plan pursuant to the procedures set forth in subparagraph 3\n(b) below, whichever is later.\nb. If the defendants wish to discontinue use of the Single Standard Methodology, defendants shall provide to the\nGovernor's Commission on Mental Retardation for its review during at least one meeting an alternative staffing\nplan that will assure the presence of adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff at each state school\nsufficient to meet the needs of the individuals who continue to reside there. This alternative staffing plan shall be\nformulated by the Department of Mental Retardation based on its reasonable, professional judgment and may or\nmay not utilize specific ratios for staff.\n4. Defendants shall not approve a transfer of any class member out of a state school into the community, or from\none community residence to another such residence, until and unless the Superintendent of the transferring\nschool (or the Regional Director of the pertinent community region) certifies that the individual to be transferred\nwill receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location, and that all ISP-recommended\nservices for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP are available at the new location.\n5. Except as set forth in other paragraphs of this Order, nothing in this Order is intended to detract from or limit\nthe discretion of the defendants in developing and improving programs, managing and determining the personnel\nand budget of the Department of Mental Retardation and other state agencies, implementing innovative services,\nimproving quality enhancement and dispute-resolution mechanisms, or allocating its resources to ensure\nequitable treatment of its citizens.\n988\n\n*988 6.

Maintaining and implementing the basic principles of the ISP.\nb. Exerting their best efforts to maintain and secure sufficient funds to meet the needs of class members under\nthis Order. The defendants shall be determined to have met their obligation under this subparagraph if the\ndefendants have secured and maintained an annual appropriation for the Department of Mental Retardation at\n[4]\nleast equal to the total gross amount of the actual appropriations for Fiscal Year 1993.\n7. a. If the defendants substantially fail to provide a state ISP process in compliance with this Order, or if there is\na systemic failure to provide services to class members as described in this Order, the plaintiffs may seek\nenforcement of the Order pursuant to this paragraph. Individual ISP disputes shall be enforced solely through the\nstate ISP process.\nb. Nothing in this Order shall make state law (including but not limited to the ISP regulations) enforceable in\nfederal court, but claims of a failure to provide an ISP process in compliance with this Order or claims of systemic\nfailure to provide ISP services required by this Order may be enforced in this court, even if such claims also state\na violation of state law.\nc. Should the plaintiff class believe that the defendants are not in substantial compliance with this Order with\nregard to systemic issues, plaintiffs may seek to reopen this case and to restore this case to the active docket\n[5]\nand to move for enforcement of this Order only after the following steps have occurred:  (1) plaintiffs have given\nwritten notice to defendants of the alleged non-compliance, including the facts alleged and the provision of the\nOrder involved; (2) defendants have been provided with 30 days to review and respond to plaintiffs' notice, and to\ninform plaintiffs of any proposed plan of correction; (3) plaintiffs and defendants (or their respective counsel) have\nmet personally at least twice to discuss and seek to resolve any remaining dispute under the notice. The court\nshall have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Order pursuant to this paragraph, which shall be the\nexclusive means of enforcing this Order.\nd. The matters which may be raised under subparagraph 7(a) above are assertions of future systemic violations\nof this Order. Nothing in this paragraph 7 shall be construed to prevent a class member from bringing an\nindependent action in the event that the individual's grievances have not been remedied through existing state\nprocedures.\ne. Plaintiffs may not seek to reopen this case based solely on facts known by them as of the date of this Order.\nPlaintiffs may, however, use existing facts in connection with any assertions of future systemic violations of this\nOrder.\n8. This Order shall take effect upon written notification to the court by the Governor that he has issued the\n989 Executive Order set forth in Appendix A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein, and that all members \n*989 of the Governor's Commission on Mental Retardation have, been sworn and the Administrator has been\n[6]\nappointed.

Commission's Powers to Serve as Ombudsman and to\nResolve Disputes\n4.1 (a) The Administrator, acting on behalf of the Commission, shall be empowered to receive complaints\nconcerning the provision of services to persons with mental retardation that have not been resolved, within a\nreasonable time, at the local level, or at the level of the Department of Mental Retardation. Prior to presenting a\nmatter for review by the Commission, the Administrator shall consider whether the complaint can be resolved\n\nthrough conciliation. If so, the Administrator shall implement conciliation discussions. In every case, the\n992 Administrator shall ensure that the Department *992 of Mental Retardation has had a full opportunity to resolve\nthe matter prior to presentation of the matter to the Commission.\n(b) The Commission shall not, in the first instance, consider complaints concerning matters that\nshould be addressed pursuant to: (i) statute or regulations concerning Individual Service Plans; (ii)\nregulations requiring complaint investigation by the Department; (iii) statutes or regulations\ngoverning abuse or neglect of persons with mental retardation; or (iv) any matter for which there\nexists another mechanism instituted by law for the purpose of addressing the complaint.

Weld William F. Weld, Governor Commonwealth of Massachusetts /s/ Michael\nJoseph Connolly Michael Joseph Connolly Secretary of the Commonwealth \nGOD SAVE THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\nEXHIBIT A\nFirst Year Budget\nThis document describes the total first year budget that will be requested for the Commission on Mental\nRetardation, the staffing and other expenses which it would cover, and the principles which will guide the\nimplementation of the budget.\nAmount of Budget. The first year budget for the Commission on Mental Retardation will be $200,000. To the\nextent this amount is insufficient to fully fund the non-personnel requirements of the Commission, the Executive\nOffice of Health and Human Services, the Department of Mental Retardation, and other appropriate state\nagencies shall provide additional funds or support as are needed to allow for travel, equipment (including\ncomputer equipment and programs), supplies, telephones, and photocopying. Any such additional support shall\nbe provided in accordance with applicable state laws and procedures.\nAdjustments to Budget. It is recognized that the needs of the Commission may change, based on its experience\nin the first year. For the second and subsequent years, the amount to be requested from the Legislature will be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as necessary, taking into consideration any recommendations of the Commission, the\nactual and anticipated workload of the staff, and to assure the accomplishment of the Commission's purposes.\nAny comments or suggestions from the Plaintiffs' counsel will be considered as well.\n994 *994 Staffing. The professional staff of the Commission will consist of from two to four professional staff, plus\nsupport staff. Professionals must have knowledge of the mental retardation service system and related agencies,\nand demonstrated experience in the field of mental retardation. Also, it is expected that graduate and\n\nundergraduate students in intern and extern programs will be attracted through formal arrangements with\ninstitutions of higher learning to assist the professional staff. The first year would begin with at least two\nprofessional staff (the Administrator and an Assistant Administrator are anticipated), both full-time, with a full-time\nsecretary. The number and nature of the staff will depend on the qualifications, and salary needs, of the persons\nhired, considered together with the non-personnel needs of the Commission. Benefits would be approximately\n28% of the total salary amounts.\nTransition. Orientation and transition briefings and assistance will be provided to the professional staff, and to the\nCommission, by the Department of Mental Retardation and, it is expected, by the Office of Quality Assurance. No\ncost would be incurred for this transitional assistance.\nCommission Member Expenses. The minimum cost expected for Commission members for reimbursement of\nexpenses is $5,832. This would include $120 per member for parking ($10/member × 12 potential monthly\nmeetings): $528 per member for travel (200 miles @ $.22/mile × 12 meetings). Total: $648 per member × 9\nmembers = $5,832.\nOther Costs. Staff travel is expected to be in the range of $1,960 (assuming 9,000 miles at $.22 per mile). Office\nspace will be sought in an existing state-owned building so that space costs may be avoided. Equipment and\nsupplies are expected to be in the range of $6,300. Computer equipment and appropriate computer programs will\nbe provided. Additional costs would be incurred for telephone and photocopy, as well as for transcription for any\nhearings or formal proceedings: these costs would likely total in the $7,000 to $10,000 range. Costs for \nconsultants to the Commission would be charged to the Commission budget or, when appropriate and agreed to,\nmight be shared with DMR or other state agencies.\nCooperation With Other State Agencies. As the Executive Order states, Par. 1.1(e), the Commission is expected\nto \"work cooperatively with the Department of Mental Retardation ... in support of the Department's mission ...\nand act as an advocate for the Department, with the public and those within state government ...\". To that end, it\nis expected that the Governor's Office, EOHHS, DMR and other agencies will join with the Commission to assist it\nto maximize the effectiveness of its work and its budget.\n[*] For a detailed exposition of the history of these cases, see Ricci v. Okin, 978 F.2d 764 (1st Cir. 1992); \nMassachusetts Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. King, 668 F.2d 602 (1st Cir.1981); Massachusetts Ass'n for\nRetarded Citizens v.

Defendants shall maintain a mechanism for keeping track of the\nidentities and locations of current class members, and the occurrence and history of transfers, which information\nshall be available to plaintiffs' counsel. During the first three years following issuance of this Order, defendants\nshall also transmit notices of the transfer of any class member to a designated representative from that\nindividual's original class. Additionally, notice shall be sent to a representative of the Massachusetts Association\nof Retarded Citizens of the transfer of any class member from the original Dever and Wrentham classes. \nAs of this date, admissions to the state schools are closed; however nothing in this Order shall preclude\ndefendants in the future from adopting a different admissions policy, or from modifying the current policy on\nadmissions.\nFor purposes of this Order, \"State School\" shall include Belchertown, Dever, Fernald and Wrentham State\nSchools and Monson Developmental Center.\n\n[2] These regulations shall guarantee that each class member be provided with the least restrictive, most normal,\nappropriate residential environment, together with the most appropriate treatment, training, and support services\nsuited to that person's individual needs.\n[3] These principles, currently in Department of Mental Retardation regulations, are \"(1) human dignity, (2)\nhumane and adequate care and treatment, (3) self-determination and freedom of choice to the person's fullest\ncapacity, (4) the opportunity to live and receive services in the least restrictive and most normal setting possible,\n(5) the opportunity to undergo normal developmental experiences, even though such experiences may entail an\nelement of risk, provided however that the person's safety and well-being shall not be unreasonably jeopardized,\nand (6) the opportunity to engage in activities and styles of living which encourage and maintain the integration of\nthe client in the community through individualized social and physical environments.\"\n[4] This amount shall be set as follows: Within 14 days of the final appropriation for the Department of Mental\nRetardation for Fiscal Year 1993, the defendants shall file with the court a certification of the total gross amount of\nactual appropriations for the Department of Mental Retardation for Fiscal Year 1993 which shall constitute an\nappendix to this Order and shall be incorporated herein by reference.\n[5] The procedures required by this subparagraph will apply except in a situation where serious irreparable harm\nwould result if all the requirements were met; in such a situation, plaintiffs shall give the maximum practical notice\nand the parties shall comply with all the requirements to the extent possible, given the urgency of the situation.\n[6] Once this Order takes effect, the Office of Quality Assurance shall limit its activities to those necessary to\ntransfer its files to the Governor's Commission. It is understood that the Office shall cease all operations upon the\nappointment of the Administrator of the Commission, or on June 30, 1993, whichever event later occurs.\n[1] The Department of Mental Retardation has determined that disclosure to the Commission of otherwise\nconfidential information about its consumers shall be in the consumers' best interest and therefore shall not be\nprohibited by law.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
