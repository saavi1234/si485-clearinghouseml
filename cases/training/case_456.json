    "summary": "<p>On September 6, 1991, Mary Hunt, a resident of the Great Oaks Center for developmentally disabled persons in Silver Springs, Maryland, filed a class-action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the State of Maryland, the administrator of Great Oaks Center, and both the Secretary and Director of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The plaintiffs, including all persons then or who may in the future be confined at Great Oaks Center, were represented by counsel from the Maryland Disability Law Center, the Mental Health Law Project, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, in addition to private firms. They asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that they had been subjected to hazardous unconstitutional conditions while in state custody at Great Oaks Center.  </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that they had been subjected to injury, abuse, neglect, and unnecessary physical restraints, as well as having been denied medical care and rehabilitative training and services. Several plaintiffs complained of injuries sustained as a result of Great Oaks personnel's failure to properly monitor the patients. Several residents died from lack of supervision as the center lacked treatment and training programs to deal with residents' aggressive and self-abusive behavior. </p><p>After two years of motions by both parties to extend time for answers, discovery orders and oppositions to class certification, the case was reassigned from Judge Joseph C. Howard to Judge Peter J. Messitte on November 15, 1993. On July 18, 1994 the Court (Judge Messitte) advised counsel that a settlement hearing would take place on September 8, 1994. The case was then referred to Magistrate Judge James E. Kenkel. Correspondence from the plaintiff's counsel indicated that the plaintiff was willing to withdraw from the Motion for Class Certification in 1995, and the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Catherine C. Blake, who entered an order permitting the plaintiffs' experts to tour the institutions upon reasonable notice on June 12, 1995. The United States entered an amicus brief on May 17, 1996  in support of the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment. </p><p>On March 25, 1999, after a stipulation of dismissal and approval signed by Judge Catherine C. Blake, the case was closed. A notice of appeal was filed on April 22, 1999 by the plaintiffs and on June 11, 2001, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition for a wrt of certiorari. </p><p>We have no more information on this file.</p><p></p>",

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT  COURT\nโข  โข  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\nMARY HUNT, et al.  *\nPlaintiffs  *\n*\nvยซ  *  Civil  Action  No.  PJM-91-2564\n*\nLOIS  MESZAROS,  et  al.  *  Hunt v. Meszaros\nDefendants.  *  IIIIIJ 111 I  Ml 11 II II Illllllllllllllll\nAMENDED  COMPLAINT   |||||||||  ||||  11 || ||  |||||||||||||||||\n v\nI.  INTRODUCTION  MR-MD-002-001\n1.  Plaintiffs, persons with developmental disabilities\nconfined by the State of Maryland in the Great Oaks Center in\nSilver Spring, Maryland, have been severely physically and\nemotionally injured and continue to be at risk of such injury.\nIn this action, plaintiffs seek to enforce their constitutional\n\"right to protection while in [state] custody\" enunciated by this\nCourt in L.J. Bv And Through Parr v. Massinaa. 699 F.Supp. 508,\n538 (D.Md. 1987) (Howard, J.), aff'd. 838 F.2d 118 (4th Cir.\n(  1988),  cert, denied. 481 U.S. 1018 (1989) .  Like the plaintiffs\nin L.J., the plaintiffs here face unnecessary and intolerable\nthreats to their lives, health and safety while in state custody.\n2.  Great Oaks Center is a dangerous place to live.  While\nin the Great Oaks Center plaintiffs have been and continue to be\nsubjected to injury, abuse, neglect, and unnecessary physical\nrestraints.  They have been denied necessary medical care, as\nwell as habilitative training and services needed to prevent\ntheir deterioration.\n3.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and\nall others similarly situated for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief to redress the hazardous unconstitutional and illegal\nconditions imposed by defendants under color of state law on\n^โข ' โข * persons with developmental disabilities who are confined and\nsegregated in Great Oaks Center.  Plaintiffs seek, inter alia, to\nenforce the federal constitutional and statutory rights of the\n\nresidents of Great Oaks Center to protection from bodily harm and\nother serious injury, to freedom from bodily restraint, to\ntraining needed to prevent their deterioration, to implementation\nof the judgments of their treating professionals that they should\nbe transferred from Great Oaks Center into services in the\ncommunity, and to nondiscrimination in programs and activities\nreceiving federal financial assistance.\nII.  JURISDICTION\n4.  This action is brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to remedy\nviolations of the laws and constitution of the United States.\nAppropriate declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202.\n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343.\n6.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to address the\ndeprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights. ..\nThey will continue to suffer irreparable harm from defendants'\nillegal actions unless injunctive relief is issued.\nIII.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n7.  Approximately 250 persons with developmental\ndisabilities are confined and segregated at the Great Oaks\nCenter.\n8.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on\nbehalf of a class of all persons now or who in the future may be\nconfined at Great Oaks Center, including persons transferred\nafter the filing of this action from Great Oaks Center into\n\n^  residential settings that do not protect their rights under\nfederal law.\n9.  Class certification is proper under Rule 23 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because (a) the class is so\nnumerous as to make joinder of all members impracticable, (b)  . *\nthere are substantial questions of law and fact common to the\nclaims of the class, (c) the claims of the plaintiffs are typical\nof the class, (d) the named plaintiffs and their counsel will\nadequately and fairly represent the interests of the class and\n(e) defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\n10.  The undersigned attorneys of the Maryland Disability  A\nr  Law Center, the Mental Health Law Project, and the American Civil\nLiberties Union of Maryland are experienced in handling federal\nlitigation of this nature.  In addition, the Maryland Disability\nLaw Center has been designated by the Governor to be the\nProtection and Advocacy system for persons with developmental\ndisabilities within this state and thus is charged with the\nresponsibility for pursuing \"legal, administrative and other\nappropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection and\nadvocacy for, the rights of such persons...\"  42 U.S.C. ยง\n6042(a)(2)(A)(i); see also Md. Health Gen. Code Ann. ยง 7-1003\n*(m)(3).\n11.  The questions of law and fact common to the claims of\nthe class include but are not limited to:\n\na.  Have defendants subjected residents of Great Oaks\nCenter to injury, abuse and neglect, unnecessary physical\nrestraints, and deprived the residents of necessary medical care\nand habilitative training and services needed to prevent\ndeterioration?  .,\nb.  Does confinement at Great Oaks Center violate\nplaintiffs1 entitlement to, inter alia, protection from bodily\nharm and other serious injury, freedom from bodily restraint, and\ntraining needed to prevent their deterioration?\nc.  Have the defendants failed to implement the\njudgment of treating professionals that plaintiffs should be\nprovided services in community settings?\nd.  Do the defendants have an obligation under federal\nlaw to implement the judgment of treating professionals that\nplaintiffs should be transferred from Great Oaks Center into\nservices in the community and to cease discriminating against\nplaintiffs based on their disabilities in programs and activities\nreceiving federal assistance?\nIV.  PLAINTIFFS\nMARY HUNT\n12.  Mary Hunt is a 50-year-old woman who has been at Great\nOaks Center since 1975.  She has lived in Maryland institutions\nfor persons with developmental disabilities since she was eight\nyears old.  Her current diagnoses include mental retardation,\nspastic quadriplegia, severe spastic cerebral palsy, multiple\nflexion contractures, gastroesophagel reflux, cataracts, and\n\noptic atrophy.  Although Ms. Hunt is non-verbal, she can\ncommunicate through vocalizations, facial expression and body\nmovement and express pleasure, pain and sadness.  She makes eye\ncontact with people she is familiar with, and responds with\nsmiles and laughter.\n13.  Ms. Hunt lives in Cottage 3 with 24 other males and\nfemales.  Because of injuries she received at Great Oaks Center,\nshe recently spent approximately one month in the Great Oaks\nCenter infirmary where she received no habilitation services.\n14. f~Ms. Hunt's medical records indicate that she requires  \"\ncareful handling and positioning A  Apparently denied such care,\nshe has suffered serious injury while at Great Oaks Center.  For\nexample, in November 1990, staff noted she was suffering from\n/  skin breakdown.  On May 13, 1991, Ms. Hunt's left arm was broken.\nStaff noted that the fracture \"seems to have been caused by\nimproper lifting or straightening of her arm.\"\n15.  Staff have recommended that Ms. Hunt be provided a new\nwheelchair so that she could have greater freedom of movement;\nhowever, a new wheelchair has not been obtained for her.  Ms.\nHunt has also been denied recommended habilitative therapy.\n16.  The professional staff at Great Oaks Center, since\n1983, have been of the opinion that Ms. Hunt should be placed in\na community residential program.  Defendants have failed to\n.implement the judgments of Ifer treatment professionals and Ms.\nHunt remains at Great Oaks Center.  She has not been placed\nbecause Maryland lacks sufficient community living arrangements,\n\nespecially those that are designed to meet the needs of persons\nwith disabilities who need to use a wheelchair.\n17.  Ms. Hunt brings this action by her next friend,\nCristine E. Boswell, who has been an advocate for persons with\nmental retardation for over 14 years.  Ms. Boswell is currently\nthe Executive Director of the Association for Retarded citizens\nof Maryland.  In the past, she has been the Executive Director of\nthe Denver Association for Retarded Citizens, the Associate\nExecutive Director of the Minneapolis Association for Retarded\nCitizens, and on the staff of the Minnesota Department of Public\nWelfare1 Mental Retardation Program Office, where she helped\ndevelop community day and residential programs for persons with\nmental retardation.\nMATROY FOSTER\n18.  Matroy Foster is a 71-year-old woman who has been at\nGreat Oaks Center since 1982.  Her current diagnoses include\nmental retardation due to head trauma, seizure disorder, and non-\nambulatory.  She has normal hearing and vocalizes some sounds.\n19.  Ms. Foster has suffered serious injury while at Great\nOaks Center.  Apparently denied the careful lifting and\npositioning she needs, she has sustained several fractured bones\nduring the past two years.  Although she is non-ambulatory, her\nleft leg was broken in February 1990.  In April 1991, when Ms.\n' Foster indicated she was in pain, staff discovered that her left\nhip was broken.  In January 1991, she was admitted to the Great\nOaks Center infirmary with severe dehydration, acute renal\n\nfailure and altered mental status, which resulted from staff's\nfailure to properly feed Ms. Foster and provide her sufficient\nfluids.\n20.  While at Great Oaks Center, Ms. Foster has failed to\nreceive necessary habilitative therapy and training consistent\nwith professional judgment.  She does not participate in\ncommunity programming.\n21.  Ms. Foster brings this action by her next friend,\nBarbara Nelson, an attorney with expertise in advocacy on behalf\nof elders and persons with disabilities.  Ms. Nelson has served\nas legal counsel for the United Blind of Minnesota, staff\nattorney for the American Council of the Blind in Washington,\nD.C., Assistant Staff Director of the American Bar Association's\nCommission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, and staff attorney\nfor the Maryland Disability Law Center.\nMICHAEL WADE\n22.  Michael Wade is a 30-year-old man who was been at Great\nOaks Center since 1970.  He has been in Maryland institutions for\npersons with developmental disabilities since he was 5 years old.\nHis diagnoses include profound mental retardation, self-injurious\nbehavior and aggression.  He is ambulatory, has receptive\nlanguage skills, follows simple directions, is aware of his\nenvironment, has normal hearing and good appetite, and expresses\nlikes and dislikes.  He likes to walk, eat, look at magazines,\ndress himself, and interact with certain staff.\n23.  Mr. Wade lives in Cottage 4, which is a locked building\n\nhousing 26 adult male clients.\n24.  To prevent him from injuring himself or others, Mr.\nWade requires both effective behavioral management and protection\nfrom assaults by other residents.  (When Mr. Wade engages in\nself-injurious behavior, it is often following an attack on him\nby other residents.)  Having been denied such necessary care, he\nhas been seriously injured while at Great Oaks Center.  For\nexample, on December 12, 1990, he suffered a black eye and\nmultiple fractures to his right upper arm and dislocation of his\nright shoulder.  On December 18, 1990 his left arm was injured\nbecause staff allowed Mr. Wade to bang it against a wall, failing\nto redirect him to a more appropriate activity as required by his\nbehavior program.\n25.  On January 1, 1991, his back was scratched and injured\nby another Great Oaks Center resident.  On February 13, 1991, his\nback was again scratched.  On March 2, 1991, he severely cut his\nhead when he banged it on a wall and a chair.  On March 23, 1991,\nhe cut his head again when he hit his head on a wall.  On May 6,\n1991, he was attacked by another resident in a classroom.  He\nthen banged his head on the table and cut his forehead,  on May\n19, 1991, he banged his head and reopened the cut.  On June 17,\n1991, he banged his head, cutting his right ear and bruising his\nright shoulder.  On July 9, 1991, he cut his right cheek and\nsuffered swelling of his face and forehead.\n26.  Since at least 1985 Mr. Wade's treating professionals\nhave recommended that he be placed in a community setting.\n\nHowever, defendants have failed to implement the judgments of the\ntreatment professionals and Mr. Wade remains at Great oaks\nCenter.\n27.  Michael Wade brings this action by his next friend,\nMark. A. Mlawer, an advocate for people with disabilities.  Mr.\nMlawer has worked for the Massachusetts Department of Mental\nHealth.  He is currently the Executive Director of the Maryland\nCoalition for Integrated Education.  In that capacity, he works\non behalf of a coalition of parents of students with disabilities\nand professionals who are seeking to ensure that students with\ndisabilities have the opportunity to be educated in their\nneighborhood schools with appropriate supports and services.\nTIMOTHY WADE\n(  28.  Timothy Wade is a 33-year-old man who was admitted to\nGreat Oaks Center in 1975.  His current diagnoses include\nprof.ound mental retardation, aggressive and self-injurious\nbehavior.  He is non-verbal and communicates through gestures.\n29.  Mr. Wade lives in cottage four, which is a locked\nbuilding housing 26 adult male clients.  He shares a bedroom with\nseveral other men.\n30.  As a result of inadequate supervision and behavioral\nmanagement, Mr. Wade has suffered numerous physical injuries,\nat Great Oaks Center.  A 1986 entry in his medical record noted\nthat it is \"clear that there is, in general, a lack [of] adequate\nstaff and supervision to effectively provide for the programming\nneeds for this man...It's essential that adequate numbers of\n\nstaff be available to provide the support for the programs\nI'\"'  developed for this client.\"\n31.  On October 21, 1989, Mr. Wade struck his forehead on an\nunused steel bedframe left in his room.  Staff had noted the\nexistence of an unused bedframe standing in his room and\nrequested its removal.\n32.  On March 27, 1990, Mr. Wade was bitten on the forehead\nby another resident.  On November 18, 1990, he was bitten on his\narms and hands by another resident while asleep.  The person who\nbit him was a carrier of Hepatitis B.  According to staff \"closer\nsupervision would have prevented the incident.\"\n33.  On May 8, 1991, Mr. Wade received two black eyes.\nSeveral other residents in the cottage also were found with black\neyes.  Staff noted that \"closer supervision must be given to\n(  prevent incidents, especially at night.\"\n34.  While at Great Oaks Center, Mr. Wade became infected\nwith Hepatitis B.\n35.  The professional staff at Great Oaks Center, since\n1985, have been of the opinion that Timothy Wade should be placed\nin a community residential program that can provide close\nsupervision.  However, defendants have failed to develop\nsufficient appropriate community placements to implement the\njudgments of the treating professionals and as a result Mr. Wade\n.remains at Great Oaks Center..*,\n36. Timothy Wade brings this action by his next friend, Paul\nMarchand.  For the past 19 years Mr. Marchand has been the\n10\n\nDirector of Governmental Affairs of the Association for Retarded\nt โขโข%\"\nCitizens of the United States.  In this position he has advocated\nfor federal public policies that promote rights protection and\ndevelopment of community-based services for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  He previously was Executive Director\"\nof the State Developmental Disabilities Council for Rhode Island,\nChief Executive. Officer of the North Rhode Island Association for\nRetarded Citizens, and a special education teacher in\nMassachusetts.  He is a member of the U.S. Rehabilitation\nServices Administration facilities task force and the Executive\nCommittee of the President's Commission on Employment of Persons\nwith Disabilities.  He was an advisor to the President's\nCommission on Mental Retardation, and has received the\nr  Distinguished Service Award from President Bush for \"promoting\nthe dignity, equality, independence and employment of people with\ndisabilities.\"\nJOHN MCCLELLAND\n37. John McClelland is 49 years old and has been a resident\nof Great Oaks Center since 1987.  He has spent 40 of his 49 years\nin Maryland institutions.  His current diagnoses include spastic\nquadriplegia and profound mental retardation.  He is non-\nambulatory and non-verbal.  Although he requires assistance with\nhygiene and grooming he is able to feed himself.\n38. He resides in Cottage Cl and attends a day program at\nGreat Oaks Center.  He has little opportunity to participate in\ncommunity activities.\n11\n\n39.  Mr. McClelland has been seriously and repeatedly\ninjured at Great Oaks Center.  On or about January 1991, Mr.\nMcClelland was dropped by staff when they were attempting to\ntransfer him from one chair to another.  The report of this\nincident states \"Staff used unreasonable force and dumped the\nclient on the wheelchair.\"\n40.  In April 1991, Mr. McClelland was bitten by another\nresident and the skin on his shoulder was broken.  Staff were\ninstructed to watch the residents more closely.\n41.  In May 1991, Mr. McClelland received three scratch\nmarks several inches long from another resident.  In June 1991,\nMr. McClelland's nose was broken when he hit his face on the\nfloor.\n42.  Mr. McClelland's training program is inadequate and\nfails to foster independence and prevent deterioration of\nexisting skills.  His most recent plan, dated October 31, 1990,\ncontains . activities such as ball rolling that are neither age-\nappropriate nor functional.\n43.  Mr. McClelland needs surgery on his foot to make him\nmore mobile and less dependent on use of a wheelchair.\n44.  The professional staff at Great Oaks Center have\ndetermined that Mr. McClelland should be placed in a community\nresidential program.  However, defendants have failed to identify\nor develop such a program and as a result Mr. McClelland remains\nat Great Oaks Center.\n45.  Mr. McClelland brings this action through his next\n12\n\nfriend, Cristine E. Boswell.\nSARAH HORVITZ\n46.  Sarah Horvitz is a 68-year-old woman who lives in  A\nCottage 2 in Great Oaks Center.  She is able to talk, to\nparticipate in a conversation, and to enjoy music.  She can feed  ..\nherself.\n47.  Ms. Horvitz does not receive active training or\ntreatment while at Great Oaks Center.  She is rarely allowed to\nparticipate in any activities in the community.\n48.  Ms. Horvitz has not been provided the close monitoring\nand supervision that staff recognizes she needs, and as a result\nMs. Horowitz has been seriously injured while at Great Oaks\nCenter.  In March 1990, her right armpit, breast and upper\nshoulder were bruised.  In the same month, she developed a\nbedsore (pressure sore) on her buttocks.  In July 1990, staff\nnoted that she had open sores on her buttocks.\n49.  In July 1990, Ms. Horvitz suffered a swollen nose and\nbruising under her left eye.  Staff noted a blister and a scraped\narea on her thigh.  In October 1990, staff noted an ulcer on Ms.\nHorvitz1 left foot.  On November 5, 1990, staff noted a cut on\nher jaw and upper lip with blood running from her mouth.  On\nNovember 6, 1990, staff found that her left toe was bleeding.\nIn April 1991, staff noted that she suffered a black eye.\n50.  Her treating professionals have directed that, to\nprevent skin breakdown, she receive frequent periods of time out\nof her wheelchair and be repositioned every hour.  On many days,\n13\n\nthese requirements have not been carried out.\n51.  In November 1990 and again in January 1991, medical\nstaff recommended that Ms. Horvitz receive a new wheelchair to\nprevent skin breakdown.  As of June 4, 1991, she had not yet\nreceived the wheelchair.  In February 1991, staff noted that she\nsuffered from skin breakdown and bedsores on her sacral area.\nDefendants have failed to obtain the wheelchair in a timely\nmanner despite her dire need for proper positioning.  Records\nstate that staff are waiting for the client's funds to\naccumulate.\n52.  Ms. Horvitz has expressed a desire to leave Great Oaks\nCenter and be moved to the community.  However, in contravention\nof professional standards and norms, she has been denied the\nopportunity to live in the community.\n53.  Ms. Horvitz brings this action through her guardian, a\nsister.\n'54.  All the named plaintiffs are subjected to or at risk of\nbeing subjected to the unsafe and dangerous conditions, excessive\nand unnecessary use of restraints, inadequate training and\ntreatment, discrimination on the basis of disability, and failure\nto implement professional judgments described below.\nV.  DEFENDANTS\n55.  The individual defendants are sued in their official\ncapacity only.\n56.  The conditions described in this complaint are the\nresult of acts and omissions of the defendants committed under\n14\n\n/--โข color of state law.\n57.  Defendant Lois Meszaros is the Director of the\nDevelopmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA\") within the\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene (\"DHMH11).  As Director,\nshe is its chief executive and administrative officer and is\nresponsible for insuring that state facilities for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities, including Great Oaks Center, are\noperated in compliance with federal law.  She is responsible for\nsubmitting to the Secretary of DHMH budget requests for both\nGreat Oaks Center and community-based services.\n58. Defendant Nelson Sabatini is the Secretary of DHMH.  As\nSecretary, he is the chief executive and administrative officer\nof the Department and is responsible for insuring that it,\n(  including its DDA which operates Great Oaks Center, fulfills its\nobligations under federal law.  He is charged under state law\nwith providing \"services to insure the protection of the\nindividual rights and liberties of individuals with a\ndevelopmental disability.\"  Md. Health Gen. Code Ann. ยง 7-\n303 (a) (1) (viii) ; see also Md. Health Gen. Code Ann. ยงยง 7-301 et\nsea. (State Plan requirements) .\n59.  Defendant Allan Radinsky is Administrator of the Great\nOaks Center.  He is responsible for the operation,\nadministration, and supervision of all aspects of the facility,\nโขincluding the custody, care, treatment and discharge of\nresidents.  He is responsible for insuring that the facility\noperates in compliance with federal law.\nV,\n15\n\n60.  The State of Maryland is a defendant herein only for\npurposes of plaintiffs' claims under the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. ยงยง720, 721 and 794.\nVI.  UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS\n61.  Great Oaks Center is an unsafe and dangerous\ninstitution, with a long history of subjecting its residents to\nsevere physical and emotional injury.  Defendants have failed to\ntake adequate steps to protect residents of Great Oaks Center\nfrom physical injury, abuse by others, self-abuse and neglect.\nAs a result, residents' lives, health and safety are in jeopardy.\nResidents are at continual risk of dying, breaking limbs, losing\ntheir eyesight and choking.  In recent years, several residents\nhave needlessly died.  One resident died after swallowing a\nrubber glove, and another died after squeezing her head between\nthe rails of a bed.  Many residents have needlessly suffered\nserious physical and other injuries, including severe cuts and\nbroken bones.\n62.  Adequate training and treatment programs have not been\ndeveloped or implemented to deal with residents' aggressive or\nself-abusive behaviors.  Staff are not sufficiently trained to\nunderstand the causes of aggressive or self-abusive behavior nor\nhow to intervene and modify it.  As a result, self-abusive,\naggressive and other interfering behaviors occur virtually\nunchecked.  Resident self-abuse is virtually an hourly occurrence\nat Great Oaks Center.\n63.  Staff do not know how to safely lift or move residents\n16\n\nor properly position their limbs and bodies.  Residents with\nsevere physical disabilities are fed improperly or too quickly,\ncausing them discomfort, health-related problems, and even life-\nthreatening conditions.\n64.  Residents do not receive the habilitative therapy,\nservices, training, stimulation and attention they need โ  and\nthat professional standards require โ  to prevent deterioration\nof and injury to their bodies, deterioration of and injury to\ntheir psychological well-being, and regression in basic life-\nskills such as mobility, eating and communication.  As a result,\nresidents suffer bedsores, contractures and deformities, and\nresidents lose or are at risk of losing basic self-care skills\nsuch as dressing, mobility, eating, toileting, and communication.\nVII.  EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY USE OF RESTRAINTS\n65.  Residents of Great Oaks Center are subject to undue\nrestraint in their freedom of movement.  Residents are\nexcessively and unnecessary locked behind closed doors.  In\naddition, they are excessively and unnecessarily locked into\nchairs, wheelchairs, helmets, wrist restraints and papoose\nboards.\n66.  Restraints at Great Oaks Center are used in lieu of\nprofessionally designed and implemented training programs and\nwhen the demands of individual residents clients become\n. overwhelming for Great Oaks\"'Center's untrained and inadequate\nstaff.\n17\n\nVIII.  INADEQUATE TRAINING AND TREATMENT\n67.  Contrary to basic professional norms, residents are\ndenied necessary and appropriate training and treatment services,\nincluding medical and dental care and treatment, nursing care,\npsychological services, personal care and protection, social work\nservices, physical and occupational therapy, speech pathology and\naudiology services, recreation, and vocational and rehabilitative\ntraining.  In many cases, the services denied have been\nprescribed by treating professionals.\n68.  Programs of training and treatment at Great Oaks Center\nexist mainly on paper.  Idleness is ubiquitous.  Programs\nprescribed in resident individual habilitation plans are often\nnot implemented.\n69.  Insofar as training programs exist at Great Oaks\nCenter, they are directed primarily to persons with moderate\ndisabilities, and not to residents with severe and profound\nretardation and multiple disabilities.  Programs, therapies and\nservices for persons with more severe disabilities are virtually\nnonexistent at Great Oaks Center.\n70.  The training actually provided residents is woefully\ninadequate.  In day programs, residents spend much of their time\nrepetitively placing nails in cans or removing nails from cans,\ncrushing cans, or unscrewing screws from nuts.  A great deal of\ntime is spent sitting idly.\n71.  Residents are not provided adequate opportunities to\ndevelop their vocational, leisure and self-care skills.  Although\n18\n\nmary persons at Great Oaks Center could participate actively in a\nvocational program, only the persons with the least severe\ndisabilities are given opportunities to do so.  Residents receive\nlittle marketable training in job skills.  There are few\nstructured recreational or leisure time activities available and\nresidents are forced to spend most of their time indoors.  Little\nage appropriate activity is available for adult residents; they\ncolor pictures and pursue other projects designed for children.\nEducation in daily living skills is rarely integrated into the\nroutine of residents in a normalized fashion.  Residents who have\ntoileting programs are expected to learn these skills at the\nstaff's convenience, and not necessarily at the time when they\nwould ordinarily go to the bathroom.  Programming for many\nresidents does not include adequate opportunities to learn about\nlife in the community.  Trips into the community are infrequent\nand almost always in groups.  Many residents have little\nopportunity to leave the institution's grounds and learn how to\nlive in society.\n72.  Defendants receive federal Medicaid funds to support\nthe operation of Great Oaks Center, which is classified as an\nIntermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (\"ICF/MR\")\nunder the Medicaid Program.\n73.  As residents of an ICF/MR, the residents of Great Oaks\nCenter are entitled under federal Medicaid law to receive \"active\ntreatment.\"  Active treatment requires the aggressive and\nconsistent implementation of a program of training, treatment,\n19\n\nhealth services and related services designed to enable residents\nto function with as much self-determination and independence as\npossible and to prevent or decelerate residents' regression or\nloss of skills.  Medicaid regulations require that active\ntreatment be implemented pursuant to an individual plan that sets'\nforth measurable goals and objectives.\n74.  The residents of Great Oaks Center are not receiving\nthe active treatment to which they are entitled.  Moreover,\nresidents' individual plans of care are inappropriate.  They are\nnot individually tailored to the needs of the resident but\nconsist of boilerplate objectives and methods.  Plans are not\nchanged even when they are manifestly unsuccessful in achieving\ntheir stated goals.  Most residents receive the same generic\n'  program.\n75.  Defendants' failure to provide plaintiffs with programs\nof training and treatment that meet professional norms has caused\nresidents to experience regression and the loss of skills they\npossessed when they entered Great Oaks Center or place them at\nrisk of such regression.\nIX.  DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY\n76.  Great Oaks Center is a self-contained facility.  All\nresidential and recreational facilities, and most educational,\ntraining and medical care programs are provided inside the\ninstitution.  Residents are segregated in this institution, many\nfor their entire lives.\n77.  The self-contained environment of Great Oaks Center\n20\n\n- i militates against community involvement.  Residents are isolated\nfrom the rest of society and deprived of opportunities to\ninteract with people without disabilities in non-custodial\nrelationships and in normal community settings.  Residents are\ndenied the experiences of observing how other people behave and\ninteract and of learning to carry out age-appropriate and\nacceptable social behavior.  Individuals who have more severe\ndisabilities rarely leave the institution.\n78.  By segregating the residents of Great Oaks Center from\nthe rest of society and congregating them together, defendants\nhave compounded and aggravated residents1 self-injurious, self-\nstimulating or aggressive behaviors, leading to their devaluation\nas individuals and placing them at increased risk of injury.\n/  79.  Great Oaks Center is designed for mass management and\ncustodial convenience.  The gross scale of institutional living\nat Great Oaks Center discourages personal, intimate, primary\nrelationships such as those enjoyed in normal living situations.\nLiving and activity space at Great Oaks Center is inadequate in\ndesign, inappropriate in setting and dehumanizing in condition.\nThe physical layouts are devoid of warmth, individuality, or\ndignity.  The physical settings at Great Oaks Center do not\npermit privacy, individuality, or freedom of association among\nresidents.\n80.  Residents are not*'provided the opportunity to\nexperience a variety of environments during the day, as are other\ncitizens, and thus are deprived of important learning\nL\n21\n\nwhat ways they relate to their friends.\n^-- โข  84.  Residents are denied training to enable them to utilize\nhygienic supplies or to exercise self-care skills necessary for\nacceptance within the larger community, as well as for personal\nhealth and comfort.\n85.  Residents are denied the experiences, interactions,\nenjoyment, and opportunity for growth and development enjoyed by\nother members of society.  They are denied the developmental\nopportunities, sensory and intellectual stimulation, comfort and\npleasure that community residents receive from their experiences\nin homes, schools, restaurants, work places and recreational\nfacilities.\n86.  Residents are denied the dignity and freedom of living\nin the community as normally as they are able.\n(  87.  In a five-year study commissioned by the Secretary of\nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of the growth\nand development of persons with severe developmental disabilities\nwho were placed in community living arrangements from an\ninstitution much like Great Oaks Center, researchers found that:\na.  Persons with severe disabilities placed in community\nliving arrangements increased in skills and development\nwhile residents of the institution did not; and\nb.  Persons with severe disabilities in community living\narrangements were receiving and benefitting from\ngreater amounts of structured services than residents\nof the institution, even though the cost of serving\nclients in the community was less than the cost of\nservices in the institution.\nThe study concluded that persons with severe developmental\ndisabilities who moved from the institution to the community were\nhas\n23\n\nโข' \"V  it is in the national interest to offer\n/โข-*  persons with developmental disabilities the\nopportunity, to the maximum extent feasible\n... to live in typical homes and communities\nwhere they can exercise their full rights and\nresponsibilities as citizens,\n42 U.S.C. ยง 6000(a)(9), communicate and socialize in age- and\nculturally-appropriate ways and utilize community resources as\nother citizens do.\n90.  Similarly, Maryland has affirmed that it is its policy:\nto foster the integration of individuals with\ndevelopmental disability into the ordinary\nlife of the communities where these\nindividuals live;\nto support and provide resources to operate\ncommunity services to sustain individuals\nwith developmental disability in the\ncommunity, rather than in institutions; [and]\nto require the administration to designate\nsufficient resources to foster and strengthen\nC ~r  a permanent comprehensive system of community\nprogramming for individuals with\ndevelopmental disability as an alternative to\ninstitutional care.\nMd. Health Gen. Code Ann. ยง 7-102(4)-(6) .\n91.  Residents of Great Oaks Center have been denied\nplacement in community living arrangements and other community\nservices on the basis of the severity of their disabilities.\nResidents who have challenging behaviors, physical disabilities\nor special medical needs are especially likely to be denied\ncommunity residential and other services.\n92.  Many residents who \"have severe developmental\ndisabilities are precluded from leaving the institution and\nliving in community settings because defendants have allowed\n25\n\ndeciding whether a resident should be provided community services\nand in formulating discharge plans and making discharge\nrecommendations; and\nf.  Failing to implement the judgments of treating\nprofessionals that residents should be provided community\nservices.\nCOUNT II:  SOCIAL SECURITY ACT\n99.  Defendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and\nthe class secured by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42\nU.S.C. ยงยง 13 96 and 1396a, and the regulations promulgated\npursuant thereto.\nCOUNT III: .REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973\n100. Plaintiffs and the class are otherwise \"qualified\nhandicapped individuals\" under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as\namended.\n101.  Defendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and\nthe class secured by Sections 100, 101 and 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. ยงยง 720, 721 and\n794, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.\nCOUNT IV:  EQUAL PROTECTION\n102.  Defendants have violated the rights of plaintiffs and\nthe class secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment by establishing, subsidizing, or otherwise\nsanctioning policies and practices that have excluded, separated,\nand segregated persons with disabilities from the rest of\nsociety.\n.:f en\n28\n\ndisabilities.\"\ng.  confining  plaintiffs  in  an  institution  that  is\nunnecessary for their care or treatment instead of discharging them\nto effective community programs.  In so doing, defendants violate\nthe  ADA,  42  U.S.C.  SS12132  and  12182 (b) (1) (iv) ,  and  its\nimplementing regulations, 28 CFR ยง35.130(b)(1)(iv) , which prohibit,\ndefendants  from  providing  services  that  are  unnecessarily\n\"separate\" and not as effective as those they could receive in the\ncommunity.\nh.  utilizing  criteria or methods of administration  which\nresult in institutionalizing plaintiffs against the recommendation\nof the treating professionals and thus, discriminating against them\non  the  basis  of  disability  in  violation  of  28  CFR\nXII.  RELIEF REQUESTED\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully  request that this  Court\ncertify the class and;\n1.  Enjoin defendants from admitting persons to Great\nOaks Center and from transferring residents of Great Oaks Center to\nresidential settings that do not protect their rights under federal\nlaw;\n2.  Enjoin defendants to transfer residents to community\nliving arrangements in accordance with the recommendations of the\ntreating professionals;\n3.  Enjoin defendants to cease the violations  of  law\nalleged above;\n4.  Award  plaintiffs  their  costs  and  reasonable\nattorneys fees; and\n30\n\n5.  Award such other and further relief as this Court\ndeems necessary and appropriate.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJl F)\nSteven Ney\nFederal Bar No. 0787\nMaureen O'Connell\nMaryland Disability Law Center\n1400 Mercantile Lane, Suite 242\nLandover, MD  20785\n(301) 925-9871\nIra Burnim\nBazelon Center\n1101 15th Street, N.W., #1212\nWashington, D.C.  20005\n(202) 467-5730\nOf Counsel\nSusan Goering\nArthur Spitzer American Civil Liberties Union\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Maryland\nFund of the National Capital Area 2219 St. Paul Street\n1400 20th Street, N.W.
