    "summary": "<p>This case is a challenge to the Biden administration's interpretation of Title IX. On April 19, 2024, the administration unveiled its Final Rule, which expanded Title IX's protections against sex discrimination in education. On April 29, 2024, four southern states and several nonprofit organizations focused on free speech, K-12 education and policy issues of concern to women filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the U.S. Department of Education. The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the Final Rule was contrary to Title IX, exceeded the agency's authority, and was arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and vacatur of the Final Rule. Judge Annemarie Carney Axon was assigned to the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs challenged three aspects of the Final Rule: its interpretation of \"sex discrimination,\" its definition of \"sex-based harassment,\" and its alteration of procedures for Title IX grievances. The Final Rule interpreted Title IX's prohibition on sex discrimination to give LGBTQ+ students and others protection from discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo; The plaintiffs argued that at the time of Title IX&rsquo;s enactment, it was settled that the law&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;sex&rdquo; referred solely to biological sex, and did not include gender identity or sexual orientation. Next, the complaint alleged that the Final Rule redefined &ldquo;sex-based harassment&rdquo; to encompass a broader set of actions. The plaintiffs claimed that the Final Rule&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;harassment,&rdquo; which includes &ldquo;&ldquo;[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient&rsquo;s education program or activity,&rdquo; exceeds the actionable harassment definition that the Supreme Court has adopted. The complaint argued this implicates First Amendment concerns, as the Final Rule requires institutions to define harassment as a &ldquo;severe or pervasive&rdquo; act, which necessarily includes instances of speech. In addition, the complaint states that the rule requires schools to change their current procedures for Title IX grievances, including limiting opportunity for parties to present witnesses at hearings and barring schools&rsquo; discretion to use a higher burden of proof. The plaintiffs argued the removal of procedures renders the rule arbitrary and capricious, as the Department failed to reasonably identify problems and devise solutions, consider relevant issues, or explain its decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the complaint argued that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2020 decision in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17313/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton County</a></em> did not control here. In that case, the Supreme Court announced that Title VII, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The plaintiffs claimed that <em>Bostock </em>was inapplicable here because Title IX and Title VII are different laws enacted under different congressional authority.</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2024, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2024 WL 3607492. The court held that the plaintiffs had not established a substantial likelihood of success on their claims on the merits. First, the opinion stated that the plaintiffs had not adequately briefed the issue of severability, despite seeking a court order enjoining the entirety of the Final Rule while only challenging a part of it. The court also rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the rule redefined &ldquo;sex,&rdquo; reasoning that the Final Rule did not redefine \"sex\" but rather reinterpreted the meaning of \"discrimination based on sex.\" Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs' claims that the rule&rsquo;s expansive definition of harassment was overbroad, likely violated First Amendment rights and was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that the agency definition of sex-based harassment, and especially inclusion of conduct that is \"severe or pervasive,\" did not conflict with the statutory language. Similarly, the court rejected the First Amendment concerns, finding that the plaintiffs did not adequately explain why case law they invoked supported their conclusions.</p>\r\n<p>The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the Department's rulemaking was unreasonable or inadequately explained under the APA&rsquo;s deferential arbitrary-or-capricious standard. Finally, the court dismissed claims that the Final Rule's removal of institutional procedures was arbitrary and capricious, finding that the Department provided sufficient guidance for its policy choices, such as electing to provide districts with flexibility on how to verify a student&rsquo;s gender identity and adoption of the single-investigator model. The court also denied a motion for an injunction pending appeal, noting that it had already rejected the plaintiff&rsquo;s substantive arguments.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit granted an injunction pending appeal on July 31, 2024 without an opinion, enjoining the enforcement of the Final Rule. On August 22, 2024, the Eleventh Circuit extended the injunction pending appeal. The Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their claims that 1) the Final Rule's interpretation of \"sex discrimination\" was contrary to Title IX, and 2) the Final Rule's definition of \"sex-based harassment\" was contrary to Title IX and raised First Amendment concerns. The Eleventh Circuit therefore enjoined the entire Final Rule in the states that had challenged it. 2024 WL 3981994.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2024, the district court granted the parties&rsquo; joint motion to stay the proceedings pending appeal. The case is ongoing as of March 2025.</p>",

See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, \n2024). While different administrations can have different policy views, they cannot override \nthe text that Congress enacted in 1972 or overrule the binding precedent of this circuit. The \nBiden rule does both—to the detriment of the States, their schools, and their students. For a \nhost of reasons, this new rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and should be set \naside. Most pressingly, this Court should stay the rule’s effective date, keeping the Trump rule \nin place while the parties litigate cross-motions for summary judgment. \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 2 of 84\nPARTIES \n1.

Defendant Miguel Cardona is the U.S. Secretary of Education and runs the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. He enforces the challenged rule. Secretary Cardona is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n10.  Defendant U.S. Department of Education is a federal agency. It enforces Title \nIX and promulgated the challenged rule.

The challenged rule is final agency action that’s reviewable under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§§704, 706. \n13.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e)(1) because Defendants are U.S. agen-\ncies or officers sued in their official capacities, Alabama resides here, no real property is in-\nvolved, and a substantial part of the relevant events will occur here. See Atlanta & F.R. Co. v. \nW. Ry. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1982); Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer Ctrs. v. Azar, 509 F. \nSupp. 3d 482 (D. Md. 2020). Alabama’s largest public university—the University of Alabama \nat Tuscaloosa, with nearly 40,000 enrolled students—is located here. The Tuscaloosa County \nschool district has 36 primary and secondary schools that serve around 20,000 students.  \nBACKGROUND \n14.  Title IX was enacted in 1972. It states: “No person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assis-\ntance.” 20 U.S.C. §1681(a).  \n4 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 5 of 84\n15.  Title IX was passed to ensure that females and males receive equal educational \nopportunities. 20 U.S.C. §1681(a)(2) (referring to “both sexes”); §1681 (a)(6)(B) (referring to \n“Men’s” and “Women’s” organizations, “the membership of which has traditionally been lim-\nited to persons of one sex”). The statute requires that, if opportunities “are provided for stu-\ndents of one sex, opportunities for reasonably comparable activities shall be provided for stu-\ndents of the other sex.” §1681(a)(8). \n16.  At the time of enactment, no one doubted that the law’s use of “sex” referred \nto biological sex. And all relevant indicators confirmed what everyone understood: “sex,” as \nused in Title IX, means biological sex and does not include “gender identity” or sexual orien-\ntation.  \n17.  Title IX prohibits schools and other recipients of federal funding from discrim-\ninating. In 1999, the Supreme Court held that, in some cases, a school’s failure to adequately \naddress sexual harassment can constitute a form of unlawful sex discrimination prohibited by \nTitle IX, even when the harasser is a student (as opposed to an employee of the school). Davis \nv. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999). But Title IX is not a freestanding sexual \nharassment tort. In fact, sexual harassment violates federal law only when “members of one \nsex are exposed to disadvantageous [conditions] to which members of the other sex are not \nexposed.” Harris v. Forklift, 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (discussing work-\nplace sexual harassment under Title VII). Moreover, a school violates Title IX’s ban on sex \ndiscrimination only for “its own misconduct.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 640, 643. The Supreme Court \nhas made clear that a school can only be held liable for sexual harassment under Title IX where \nthe school itself discriminates or is deliberately indifferent to harassment that is “so severe, \n5 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 6 of 84\npervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education.” Id. \nat 652 (emphases added). This standard intentionally excludes “a single instance of one-on-\none peer harassment,” even if “sufficiently severe.” Id. at 652-53. When crafting the Davis \nstandard, the Court noted that it chose this stringent definition to avoid First Amendment \nconcerns. E.g., id. at 648-49, 652-53. \n18.  Relatedly, the executive branch has long read Title IX to require “prompt and \nequitable” grievance procedures to investigate and resolve complaints of sex discrimination. \nSee Sexual Harassment Guidance, OCR (1997), perma.cc/KU9S-FWE3; Revised Sexual Harassment \nGuidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, OCR (Jan. \n2001), perma.cc/7UY9-QP7W. Those procedures cannot deny due process to the accused, or \nunfairly favor one sex over the other. \n19.  These  basic  principles—the  statute’s  equal-opportunity/anti-discrimination \nmandate, the meaning of “sex,” the definition of actionable harassment, and the procedures \nfor resolving grievances—began to unravel, however, with the Obama administration. \nI.   The  Obama  administration,  through  guidance  and  investigations, \nunsuccessfully tries to inject gender identity into Title IX, broaden the \nscope of sexual harassment, and relax procedural protections. \n20.  The Obama administration sought to remake Title IX. Through guidance and \naggressive investigations, that administration tried to expand Title IX to include gender iden-\ntity, broaden the scope of actionable sexual harassment, and relax procedural protections for \nthe accused. \n6 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 7 of 84\n21.  Start with gender identity. Following the presidential transition in January 2009, \nactivists launched an aggressive campaign lobbying Congress and the White House to recog-\nnize gender identity as a protected class under federal civil-rights laws. \n22.  Those early lobbying efforts focused on democratically enacted laws. In Octo-\nber 2009, for example, Congress passed hate-crimes legislation that included “gender identity” \nand “sexual orientation” as independent protected characteristics alongside other protected \ntraits like race, religion, and national origin. 18 U.S.C. §249(a)(2). \n23.  After the Republican Party won a majority of the House in 2010, however, the \npressure campaign shifted to unilateral executive action. See, e.g., NCTE 2010 Annual Report 8, \nNat’l Ctr. for Transgender Equality, perma.cc/3AB5-Q7JK (“While we do not anticipate sig-\nnificant federal legislative victories for 2011, we … are planning for key wins in several federal \nadministrative policy areas. In particular, we wil[l] [a]dvocate with the federal government to \ninterpret existing civil rights laws such as … Title IX … to cover transgender people.”). \n24.  In 2013, Congress considered a bill to extend Title IX’s sex-based provisions to \ngender identity. According to the “findings” section of that proposed law, congressional action \nwas necessary because “federal statutory protections expressly address discrimination on the \nbasis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, and national origin” but “do not expressly include \n‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity.’” H.R. 1652, 113th Cong. (2013). The bill failed.  \n25.  Tellingly, the same year that it rejected the bill to expand Title IX, Congress \nreauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, and, in the process, amended the law to pro-\nhibit recipients of federal grants from discriminating “on the basis” of “sex” or “gender iden-\ntity” or “sexual orientation.” See 34 U.S.C. §12291(b)(13)(A). Right after listing “sex,” “gender \n7 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 8 of 84\nidentity,” and “sexual orientation” as distinct concepts, the law emphasizes that “nothing in \nthis paragraph shall prevent any … program or activity from consideration of an individual’s \nsex” if “sex segregation or sex-specific programming is necessary to the essential operation of [the] \nprogram.” §12291(b)(13)(B) (emphases added). And today, Section 12291 also prohibits “fe-\nmale genital mutilation or cutting,” which it defines in explicitly biological terms. §12291(a)(15) \n(incorporating definition of female genital mutilation in 18 U.S.C. §116). \n26.  In 2014, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights published a “guidance” doc-\nument asserting that “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimi-\nnation based on gender identity” and “sexual orientation.” Questions and Answers on Title IX and \nSexual Violence B-2, OCR (Apr. 29, 2014) (2014 letter), perma.cc/5HV5-RVUK. \n27.  In 2015, Congress considered a new bill that proposed to do what the Depart-\nment claimed to have already accomplished through its 2014 letter: extend Title IX’s protec-\ntions to differential treatment based on gender identity. See S.439, 114th Cong. (2015). The bill \nwas nearly identical to the one that Congress rejected in 2013. Once again, Congress did not \npass the legislation. \n28.  As the failed attempts to amend Title IX piled up, so did the pressure from \noutside groups demanding that the government change Title IX through unilateral executive \naction. \n29.  In May 2016, the Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter informing edu-\ncational institutions that took federal funding about their new “Title IX obligations regarding \ntransgender students.” 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender Students 2, U.S. \nDep’ts of Educ. & Justice (May 13, 2016) (2016 letter), perma.cc/2VTQ-RUYP. Among other \n8 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 9 of 84\nthings, the letter announced that the Department would “trea[t] a student’s gender identity as \nthe student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations.” Id. \n30.  The 2016 letter informed schools that because a student who asserts a female \ngender identity must be treated identically to a biologically female student under Title IX, any \nattempt to restrict shower, bathroom, or locker-room use according to biological sex would \nbe unlawful. Id. at 3. It also warned schools that failing to “use pronouns and names consistent \nwith a student’s gender identity” constituted unlawful harassment under Title IX. Id. at 2. \n31.  Thirteen States sued, alleging that the 2016 letter was unlawful under the APA. \nSee Texas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810 (N.D. Tex. 2016). The Northern District of \nTexas agreed and issued a preliminary injunction. Id. at 815. The court held that the Depart-\nment’s purported interpretive guidance “failed to comply with” the APA by, among other \nthings, “contradict[ing] the existing legislative and regulatory texts.” Id. \n32.  The Northern District of Texas was right. When Congress enacted Title IX in \n1972, “‘sex’ was commonly understood to refer to physiological differences between men and \nwomen—particularly  with  respect  to  reproductive  functions.”  Neese  v.  Becerra,  2022  WL \n1265925, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 26); see Sex, Webster’s Third International Dictionary 2081 \n(1971) (“The sum of the morphological, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities of living \nbeings that subserves biparental reproduction with its concomitant genetic segmentation and \nrecombination which underlie most evolutionary change ….”); Sex, American Heritage Dic-\ntionary 1187 (1976) (“The property or quality by which organisms are classified according to \ntheir reproductive functions.”). Then and now, “the overwhelming majority of dictionaries” \ndefine “sex” based on “biology and reproductive function.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 812; accord \n9 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 10 of 84\nGrimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 632 (4th Cir. 2020) (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) \n(“virtually every dictionary definition of ‘sex’ referred to the physiological distinctions between \nmales and females, particularly with respect to their reproductive functions”). “Reputable dic-\ntionary definitions of ‘sex’ from the time of Title IX’s enactment show that when Congress \nprohibited discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education, it meant biological sex, i.e., dis-\ncrimination between males and females.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 812. \n33.  What dictionaries suggest, context confirms. See Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 321 (2014) (“[R]easonable statutory interpretation must account for both the \nspecific context in which language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” \n(cleaned up)). Neighboring provisions recognize only two sexes. Section 1681(a)(2) distin-\nguishes between institutions that “admi[t] only students of one sex” and institutions that \n“admi[t] students of both sexes.” 20 U.S.C. §1681(a)(2) (emphases added). Section 1681(a)(8) \nlikewise refers to sex in binary terms. Under that provision, if father-son or mother-daughter \nactivities are provided for “one sex,” then comparable activities must be provided for “the \nother sex.” §1681(a)(8); see §1686 (letting educational institutions maintain separate living fa-\ncilities for “the different sexes”).  \n34.  Judicial opinions from the first several decades of Title IX’s existence reinforce \nthat “sex” was widely understood to refer to immutable, biological differences between males \nand females. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996) (VMI must “afford \nmembers of each sex privacy from the other sex” (emphasis added)); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 \nU.S. 677, 686 (1973) (“sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic deter-\nmined solely by the accident of birth”); Clark ex rel. Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d \n10 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 11 of 84\n1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1982) (“due to average physiological differences, males [will] displace \nfemales to a substantial extent if they [are] allowed to compete” in women’s sports, and “ath-\nletic opportunities for women [will] be diminished” as a result). \n35.  The law’s implementing regulations are similarly clear. They specify, for exam-\nple, that discrimination against a student “on the basis of pregnancy” constitutes discrimina-\ntion “on the basis of sex.” 34 C.F.R. §106.40(b)(1). Federal courts have recognized this rule as \na valid corollary to Title IX’s ban on sex-based discrimination based on the understanding that \n“sex” refers to “the ‘structural’ and ‘functional’ differences between male and female bodies.” \nConley v. Nw. Fla. State Coll., 145 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1077 (N.D. Fla. 2015); see Muro v. Bd. of \nSupervisors of LSU, 2019 WL 5810308, at *3 (E.D. La. Nov. 7, 2019) (“[A]n adverse action \ntaken against a student on the basis of pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions is taken \nbecause of her sex.”). \n36.  Title IX regulations governing intramural athletics also refer to sex in terms of \nphysical and biological realities. See 34 C.F.R. §106.41(a) (“No person shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in ... any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural \nathletics.”); §106.41(b) (authorizing sex-specific competitions for “contact sports” such as \nboxing, football, and any “other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily \ncontact”). Congress mandated those regulations only two years after it enacted Title IX. In \n1974, Congress passed the Javits Amendment, which directed the Department to promulgate \nrules “implementing the provisions of Title IX,” including “reasonable provisions considering \nthe nature of the particular sports.” Public Law 93-380 (H.R. 69), §844, 88 Stat. 484 (Aug. 21, \n1974). To ensure that the Department fulfilled Title IX’s purpose, the Javits Amendment \n11 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 12 of 84\nstated that Congress would review the sports-related regulations to assess whether they were \n“inconsistent with the Act from which [they] deriv[e] [their] authority.” Id. These longstanding \nregulations strongly suggest that sex cannot be read to mean something other than biological \nsex. See Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 97 (2023) (“[T]he government has repeatedly issued \nguidance to the public at odds with the interpretation it now asks us to adopt. And surely that \ncounts as one more reason yet to question whether its current position represents the best \nview of the law.” (cleaned up)); Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 168 (2021) (similar). \n37.  This commonsense reading of Title IX’s reference to “sex” has been reinforced \nby congressional action (and inaction) in recent years. Twice in the past decade, Congress has \nconsidered legislation to amend Title IX to apply to gender identity. See, e.g., H.R. 1652, 113th \nCong. (2013); S. 439, 114th Cong. (2015). Yet “Congress has not amended the law to state as \nmuch”; so “it is questionable,” to put it mildly, “whether the Secretary can alter the term ‘sex’ \nby administrative fiat.” Neese, 2022 WL 1265925, at *13. \n38.  During floor debates over Title IX before its enactment, members of the Senate \ndiscussed Title IX’s application solely in the context of biological sex and stated that the law \nwould require equality between the sexes, not erase sexual distinctions altogether. See, e.g., 117 \nCong. Rec. 30,407 (1971) (statement of Sen. Bayh) (“I do not read this as requiring integration \nof dormitories between the sexes, nor do I feel it mandates the [sexual] desegregation of foot-\nball fields … [or] that the men’s locker room be [sexually] desegregated.”). And in the House, \nRepresentative Thompson of Georgia, concerned about Title IX’s impact on privacy rights, \nintroduced an amendment stating that nothing in the law “shall preclude any education insti-\ntution from maintaining separate living facilities because of sex.” 117 Cong. Rec. 39,260 \n12 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 13 of 84\n(1971). The amendment passed. 117 Cong. Rec. 39,263 (1971); see 20 U.S.C. §1686 (“Notwith-\nstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, nothing contained herein shall be \nconstrued to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from main-\ntaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”). \n39.  Contemporary scholarship and commentary likewise reflect a broad public con-\nsensus that Title IX’s distinctions are grounded in biological realities rather than self-concep-\ntions of maleness or femaleness. Three years after Title IX’s passage, then-Professor Ruth \nBader Ginsburg wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post advocating for constitutional guaran-\ntees of the privacy rights recognized by Title IX. See Ginsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights \nAmendment A21, Wash. Post (Apr. 7, 1975) (“Separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform per-\nsonal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual pri-\nvacy.”). Two years later, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights addressed the same issue and \npublished a report concluding that “the personal privacy principle permits maintenance of \nseparate sleeping and bathroom facilities” for males and females under Title IX. Sex Bias in the \nU.S. Code 216, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1977). \n40.  This widespread agreement about the meaning of Title IX’s reference to “sex” \nlasted for nearly four decades. Until the Obama administration. \n41.  The Obama administration also sought to broaden what counted as sexual har-\nassment under Title IX and to force universities to adopt certain grievance procedures. In \n2011, the Department issued a Dear Colleague letter about “Title IX’s requirements related to \nstudent-on-student sexual harassment” and “schools’ responsibility to take immediate and ef-\nfective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.” 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual \n13 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 14 of 84\nViolence 2, OCR (Apr. 4, 2011) (2011 letter), perma.cc/8HJG-P7YZ. Contra the Supreme \nCourt in Davis, the Department asserted that “a single or isolated incident of sexual harassment \nmay create a hostile environment if the incident is sufficiently severe.” Id. at 3. The Depart-\nment also stated that schools must use the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard rather \nthan the higher clear-and-convincing standard. See id. at 11. \n42.  The Obama administration also used enforcement actions to coerce schools to \nchange their Title IX procedures. For example, in 2013, the Department’s Office for Civil \nRights published its findings from an investigation into the University of Montana and the \ndetails of its agreement with the university. University of Montana, DOJ Case No. DJ 169-44-9, \nOCR Case No. 10126001 (May 9, 2013), perma.cc/EYT7-8VFK. The Department declared \nthat the agreement would “serve as a blueprint for colleges and universities throughout the \ncountry to protect students from sexual harassment and assault.” Id. at 1.  \n43.  This “blueprint” stated that sexual harassment must “broadly” cover “‘any un-\nwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,’” including “verbal” conduct. Id. at 4, 8 (emphasis added). \nThe verbal conduct need not be “objectively offensive”; mere subjective offense could estab-\nlish sexual harassment. Id. at 9. The Department recognized that its definition of sexual har-\nassment deviated from Davis by covering “severe or pervasive” verbal conduct that merely \n“limit[s] a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program.” Id. at 5 \n(emphases added); see id. at 9 (same).  \n44.  As to the grievance procedures, the blueprint reiterated the Obama administra-\ntion’s view that schools must use the preponderance standard. Id. at 10. \n14 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 15 of 84\nII.   The Trump administration issues a notice-and-comment rule that aligns \nTitle IX to first principles and Supreme Court precedent. \n45.  In May 2020, for the first time in almost two decades, the Department promul-\ngated a notice-and-comment rule addressing Title IX’s application to schools and universities. \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial \nAssistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026, 30,036 (May 19, 2020) (2020 rule). \n46.  The 2020 rule acknowledged several public comments urging the Department \nto “maintain” the requirements outlined in the 2016 letter—in other words, to treat gender \nidentity the same as biological sex and to subject students to formal discipline for failing to \nuse a classmate’s preferred pronouns—but the Department declined those requests. See id. at \n30,177.  \n47.  The 2020 rule also “adopt[ed]” the Supreme Court’s definition of sexual har-\nassment from Davis “verbatim.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,036. Broader definitions of harassment, \nthe Department found, have “infringed on constitutionally protected speech” and have led \n“‘many potential speakers to conclude that it is better to stay silent.’” Id. at 30,164-65 & nn.738-\n39. The Davis standard “ensures that speech … is not peremptorily chilled or restricted” be-\ncause it applies only when harassment rises to the level of “serious conduct unprotected by the \nFirst Amendment.” Id. at 30,151-52 (emphasis added); accord id. at 30,162-63. The 2020 rule \nthus defined “[s]exual harassment” to mean, in relevant part, “[u]nwelcome conduct deter-\nmined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it ef-\nfectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. \n§106.30(a) (emphases added). \n15 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 16 of 84\n48.  Finally, the 2020 rule strengthened the rights of students accused of sexual har-\nassment under Title IX. The rule required schools to, among other things, provide the accused \nwith written notice of the charges against them, 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,571, let a representative \naccompany them to disciplinary hearings, id. at 30,577, and let that counsel cross-examine \nwitnesses, id. It specified that schools could choose between a preponderance or clear-and-\nconvincing standard to adjudicate accusations of Title IX misconduct, but only if they used \nthe same standard for “all formal complaints of sexual harassment,” including “formal com-\nplaints against employees.” Id. at 30,575. \n49.  All attempts to vacate the 2020 rule through litigation failed. E.g., Pennsylvania v. \nDeVos, 480 F. Supp. 3d 47, 59-60 & n.11 (D.D.C. 2020); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 477 \nF. Supp. 3d 279, 287-88 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). One court ruled that one partial provision prohibit-\ning adjudicators from considering “all statements not subject to cross-examination” was arbi-\ntrary and capricious because the Department failed to consider one aspect of the problem. \nVictim Rts. L. Ctr. v. Cardona, 2021 WL 3516475, at *1 (D. Mass. Aug. 10); Victim Rts. L. Ctr. v. \nCardona, 552 F. Supp. 3d 104, 132-34 (D. Mass. 2021); see 34 C.F.R. §106.45(6)(i). The Biden \nadministration chose not to appeal that ruling. Every other challenge to the 2020 rule failed, \nand every other part of the rule that was challenged was upheld. \n50.  One month after the Department promulgated the final version of the 2020 \nrule, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that an employer violated \nTitle VII when it fired an employee solely because of the employee’s asserted gender identity \nor sexual orientation. 590 U.S. 644, 667-69 (2020). Bostock, a case about Title VII, is irrelevant \n16 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 17 of 84\nto Title IX. The Court “agree[d] that homosexuality and transgender status are distinct con-\ncepts  from sex,”  but  it  concluded  that  firing  employees  “based  on  homosexuality  or \ntransgender status” still triggers Title VII’s protections because the employer’s action “neces-\nsarily entails” a decision made “in part because of the affected individuals’ sex.” Id. at 669. The \nCourt’s decision thus hinged on the premise that sex is binary and immutable, and that an \nemployee’s biological sex is a necessary component of any determination about whether “dis-\ncrimination because of sex” has occurred under Title VII. And the Court made clear that it \ndid not “prejudge” questions about whether its decision “swe[pt] beyond Title VII to other \nfederal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination”; nor did it “purport to address bath-\nrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind” for “Title VII,” let alone Title IX. Id. at \n681. \n51.  The Department’s initial assessment of Bostock tracked this reasoning. In Janu-\nary 2021, the Department published a memo analyzing the Bostock decision and clarifying that \nBostock did not affect any aspect of the 2020 rule. See Memorandum re: Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. 1, \nOCR (Jan. 8, 2021), perma.cc/CJE3-GH52. This memo reiterated that the Department’s \n“longstanding construction of the term ‘sex’ in Title IX to mean biological sex, male or fe-\nmale,” is “the only construction consistent with the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ at the \ntime of Title IX’s enactment.” Id.  \n52.  The Bostock memo noted that “Title IX[’s] text is very different from Title VII[’s] \ntext in many important respects.” Id. Like the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits and other federal \ncourts, the memo observed that the Supreme Court “decided [Bostock] narrowly, specifically \nrefusing to extend its holding to Title IX and other differently drafted statutes.” Id. The memo \n17 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 18 of 84\nemphasized that “[u]nder Title IX and its regulations, a person’s biological sex is relevant for \nthe considerations involving athletics, and distinctions based thereon are permissible.” Id. at \n7. The memo further specified that “schools must consider students’ biological sex when de-\ntermining whether male and female student athletes have equal opportunities to participate.” \nId. (emphasis added). \n53.  In short, the Bostock memo concluded that “statutory and regulatory text and \nstructure, contemporaneous Supreme Court authorities, and the Department’s historic prac-\ntice demonstrate that the ordinary public meaning of the term ‘sex’ at the time of Title IX’s \nenactment could only have been … ‘biological distinctions between male and female.’” Id. at 2.  \n54.  The Bostock memo mirrored the Department’s other pronouncements. On Oc-\ntober 16, 2020, for instance, the Department’s Office of Civil Rights settled a complaint \nagainst Franklin Pierce University alleging that the university violated Title IX by “permitting \ntransgender athletes to participate in women’s intercollegiate athletic teams.” Letter to Kim \nMooney 1, OCR (Oct. 16, 2020), perma.cc/PY8L-VJWB. The settlement required the university \n“to rescind the Policy [and] cease any and all practices related” to it. Id. at 6. It also explained \nthe Department’s view of Bostock and Title IX: \n[I]f Bostock’s reasoning under Title VII were applied to policies regarding single-sex \nsports teams under Title IX, it would confirm that the Department’s regulations authorize single-\nsex teams only based on biological sex. In Bostock, the Court took the position that “homo-\nsexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex,” such that “when \nan employer fires an employee for being homosexual or transgender, it necessarily and \nintentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex.” Under that \nlogic, special exceptions from single-sex sports teams based on homosexuality or \ntransgender status would themselves generally constitute unlawful sex discrimination, \nbecause homosexuality and transgender status are not physiological differences rele-\nvant to the separation of sports teams based on sex. In other words, if Bostock applies, \nit would require that a male student-athlete who identifies as female not be treated \nbetter or worse than other male student-athletes. If the school offers separate-sex \n18 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 19 of 84\nteams, the male student-athlete who identifies as female must play on the male team, \njust like any other male student-athlete. \n Id. at 5 (emphasis added) (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660-61, 665).  \nIII.   The Biden administration publishes unlawful guidance, then engages in \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, ending with the rule challenged here.  \n55.  On June 22, 2021, the Department, yet again, tried to modify the scope of Title \nIX without any input from Congress or the public. See Enforcement of Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of \nBostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021). In an abrupt reversal from \nits own analysis just six months prior, the Department claimed that Bostock required new in-\nterpretive guidance. Id. at 32,637-39. It didn’t explain why it now disagreed with its previous \nstance or make any other effort to justify its departure. \n56.  Like the 2016 letter, the 2021 guidance was quickly challenged and enjoined by \na federal court. The Eastern District of Tennessee held that the guidance was, in substance, a \nlegislative rule that should have gone through the notice-and-comment process. Tennessee v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 815, 837 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). Far from applying “the Su-\npreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock” to Title IX, the Department “advance[d] new interpreta-\ntions” and “impose[d] new legal obligations” on States and educational institutions. Id. at 817, \n833. \n57.  In July 2022, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking that \nreasserted its position in the 2021 guidance, along with many other significant revisions to the \nTitle IX landscape. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Re-\nceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022). \n19 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 20 of 84\n58.  Like the enjoined 2021 guidance, the proposed rule scrapped the Department’s \nbiology-based definition of sex based on little more than boilerplate citations to Bostock, again \nbrushing aside its previous analysis. Id. at 41,410. The proposed rule acknowledged the Bostock \nmemo’s conclusion that “sex” under Title IX refers to “biological sex,” but it rejected that \nconclusion as unreliable because the memo “did not … explain how a school should determine \na student’s ‘biological’ sex.” Id. at 41,531. The Department did not explain its newfound con-\nfusion about how biology works.  \n59.  The proposed rule also jettisoned the Davis standard for actionable sexual har-\nassment, id. at 41,568-69; removed procedural protections for accused students, such as the \nright to present witnesses, id. at 41,485, 41,497, the right to inspect all the evidence against \nthem, id. at 41,488, 41,500, the right to a live hearing, id. at 41,577-78, and secondary students’ \nright to participation by a representative, id. at 41,577. \n60.  The proposed rule was met with significant opposition from concerned observ-\ners spanning both sides of the aisle, numerous major faith groups, and generations old and \nnew. In all, the Department received over 240,000 comments on the proposed rule, 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,477—the vast majority of which were negative. \n61.  Still, after many delays, the Department published a “final rule” on April 29, \n2024, that was materially indistinguishable from the proposed rule. Nondiscrimination on the Basis \nof Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 \n(Apr. 29, 2024). The Department set the rule’s effective date for August 1, 2024. Id. at 33,476. \nThis final rule has all the same legal and constitutional infirmities as the proposed rule. \n20 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 21 of 84\nA.   The challenged rule redefines “sex” to include “gender identity” \nand sexual orientation.  \n62.  The challenged rule redefines “sex” to include “gender identity” and “sexual \norientation,” declares unlawful longstanding policies requiring individuals to use bathrooms \nmatching their biological sex, and upends the foundation of women’s sports. All illegal. \n63.  The rule’s first move is to redefine “sex” to include “gender identity” and “sex-\nual orientation.” It declares that “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination \non the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual \norientation, and gender identity.” Id. at 33,886 (34 C.F.R. §106.10). The Department does not \nprovide an express definition for “sex” but also does not dispute that “sex” means what it has \nalways meant: “biological sex.” The Department instead contends that “even assuming ‘sex’ \nmeans ‘biological sex,’” “Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses sexual ori-\nentation and gender identity discrimination.” Id. at 33,807; accord id. at 33,804 (“Title IX’s cov-\nerage of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity does not depend on \nwhether sex is defined to encompass only certain biological characteristics.”). But the Depart-\nment is playing word games; it’s clear that the Department is trying to inject, for the first time, \ngender ideology into Title IX, contrary to longstanding practice and the statute’s original public \nmeaning.  \n64.  The Department states that its new conception of sex discrimination applies in \n“any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or \nactivity.” Id. at 33,887 (34 C.F.R. §106.31(a)(1)). Though it admits that Title IX allows “differ-\nent treatment or separation on the basis of sex” in “limited circumstances,” the rule states that, \neven in those exempted circumstances, recipients cannot “subjec[t] a person to more than de \n21 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 22 of 84\nminimis harm.” Id. (34 C.F.R. §106.31(a)(2)). And preventing someone from participating \n“consistent with [that] person’s gender identity” is always “more than de minimis harm.” Id. \n65.  The rule then states what it views as those “limited circumstances” where sex \ndiscrimination is allowed: “20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the corresponding regulations \n§§106.12 through 106.15,” “20 U.S.C. 1686 and its corresponding regulation §106.32(b)(1),” \nand “§106.41(b).” Id. Absent from this list is the Department’s regulation on separate bath-\nrooms and locker rooms: 34 C.F.R. §106.33.  \n66.  Though the rule doesn’t expressly rescind §106.33, the Department says that its \nregulation is null and void. That regulation is not backed by a “statutory exception,” the De-\npartment claims, and the Department “declines to adopt the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning in \nAdams that the statutory carve out for living facilities” justifies it. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821. In \nother words, the rule declares §106.33 invalid without formally rescinding it and proclaims that \nexcluding transgender or nonbinary students from using the bathroom or locker room of the \nopposite sex is illegal. Id. And the rule concedes that its new bathroom regulation is unlawful \nunder existing Eleventh Circuit precedent. \n67.  Though the Department understood Title IX differently in 2021, the Depart-\nment claims that its prior position “was at odds with Title IX’s text and purpose and the \nreasoning of the courts that had considered the issue.” Id. at 33,807. Bostock, the Department \nsays, makes clear “that it is ‘impossible to discriminate against a person’ on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender identity without ‘discriminating against that individual based on sex.’” \n22 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 23 of 84\nId. at 33,816 (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660). Never mind that Bostock does not extend be-\nyond Title VII and involved a materially different statute with critically different text, history, \nand context. \n68.  And while the rule “strongly agrees” that schools “have a legitimate interest in \nprotecting all students’ safety and privacy,” id. at 33,821, it denies any relationship between \nthat interest and “excluding transgender students from accessing sex-separate facilities and \nactivities consistent with their gender identity,” id. at 33,820, dismissing the privacy and safety \nconcerns as “myth,” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,535. \n69.  The new rule also will cause biological men who identify as women to be al-\nlowed to compete in women’s sports. The rule claims that sex-separate athletic teams can \ncontinue because the Department has a regulation that expressly allows it. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,816-17, 33,839. But the rule defines sex discrimination under Title IX to include discrimi-\nnation based on gender identity and applies that new definition to circumstances where the \nDepartment’s regulations expressly allow sex-separate facilities, like restrooms. It applies that \nnew definition because it thinks the restroom regulation is invalid to the extent it requires all \nstudents to use the restroom that corresponds to their biological sex. See id. at 33,819-21. But \nthe Department thinks the exact same thing about the regulation governing same-sex athletics. \nSee  B.P.J.  v.  West  Virginia,  Doc.  42,  No.  2:21-cv-316  (S.D.  W.  Va.  June  17,  2021), \nperma.cc/ZV73-B4P6 (arguing that Title IX and the Constitution invalidate policies that “cat-\negorically exclude transgender girls from participating in single-sex sports restricted to girls”). \nIn other words, the Department claims to permit women’s sports, so long as women’s sports \n23 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 24 of 84\nare open to men. The rule thus requires—or will predictably coerce—schools to allow biolog-\nical males to compete on athletic teams for women or girls, denying female students equal \nathletic opportunities, playing time, and fair competition. And it concededly affects sports by \nchanging the rule for sex-separated locker rooms.  \n70.  Finally, the rule emphasizes that its new definitions “preempt” conflicting state \nor local law, such as sex-separate restroom policies. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,540-41; id. at 33,885 \n(34 C.F.R. §106.6(b)). At the same time, the Department concedes that Eleventh Circuit prec-\nedent squarely forecloses the rule’s ban on separate bathrooms and locker rooms based on \nbiological sex. Id. at 33,820-21. Adams, the Department concedes, “determined that ‘sex’ as \nused in Title IX can only refer to ‘biology and reproductive function,’ not gender identity, and \nthat restrooms are covered by a statutory provision permitting a recipient to maintain ‘separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.’” Id. (quoting Adams, 57 F.4th at 812-15). Instead, the \nDepartment merely says that it “does not agree” with Adams and other courts coming to the \nsame conclusion. Id. at 33,820. But its disagreement cannot displace binding precedent’s au-\nthoritative interpretation of Title IX or the still-in-effect implementing regulations. \nB.   The challenged rule redefines “sex-based harassment.” \n71.  As discussed, the 2020 rule defined hostile-environment harassment by adher-\ning “verbatim” to the Supreme Court’s definition in Davis: “[u]nwelcome conduct determined \nby a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively \ndenies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. \n§106.30(a) (emphases added); accord Davis, 526 U.S. at 652. The rule challenge here concededly \nexceeds Davis and defines harassment far more broadly. \n24 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 25 of 84\n72.  The challenged rule prohibits “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on \nthe totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or \npervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s \neducation program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment).” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 \nC.F.R. §106.2). \n73.  It adds a non-exhaustive list of facts to consider. “Whether a hostile environ-\nment has been created is a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration of the following”: \n(i)  The degree to which the conduct affected the complainant’s ability to access the \nrecipient’s education program or activity;  \n(ii)  The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct;  \n(iii)  The parties’ ages, roles within the recipient’s education program or activity, pre-\nvious interactions, and other factors about each party that may be relevant to \nevaluating the effects of the conduct;  \n(iv)  The location of the conduct and the context in which the conduct occurred; \nand  \n(v)  Other sex-based harassment in the recipient’s education program or activity. \nId. \n74.  The Department concedes that its rule is “broader” than the 2020 rule and the \nDavis standard. See id. at 33,498 (“The Department’s final definition is not identical to Davis \n… because the Department … believes a broader standard is appropriate.”). And it is broader. \nThe rule applies even if the harassment merely “limits” a person’s “ability to participate in or \nbenefit from” a program or activity, id. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2), rather than “denies” a \nperson “access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school”; the rule \nthus covers mere negative effects like a “‘decline in grades,’” a choice to skip class, or a decision \nnot to attend a campus activity, Davis, 526 U.S. at 652-53. The rule also expands Title IX to \n25 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 26 of 84\ncover harassment that’s “severe or pervasive,” rather than “severe and pervasive”; the rule thus \nreaches even a single or isolated incident. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2); contra 526 \nU.S. at 652-53. Worse, under the Department’s reading, “severe or pervasive” provides no \nadditional limit: Harassment is “‘severe or pervasive,’” the Department says, “if it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,508.  \n75.  Broader still, the rule requires recipients to “promptly and effectively end any \nsex discrimination,” regardless whether they were deliberately indifferent to it. See id. at 33,889 \n(34 C.F.R. §106.44(f)(1)); contra 526 U.S. at 650-52. And the rule uses a “totality-of-known-\ncircumstances approach,” which “exacerbates” its breadth. Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, 32 \nF.4th 1110, 1121 (11th Cir. 2022). \n76.  This new, broader definition of harassment—combined with the Department’s \ninclusion of gender identity—effectively requires recipients to ensure that students use “pro-\nnouns and names consistent with a student’s gender identity.” 2016 Letter at 3. The Depart-\nment cites approvingly (multiple times) a district-court decision that says it’s constitutional for \nK-12 schools to ban “misgendering.” See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,504, 33,506 (citing PDE v. Olentangy \nLoc. Sch. Dist., 2023 WL 4848509, at *2 (S.D. Ohio July 28)). It disavows and disagrees with a \nprior memorandum that said “refusing to treat a student consistent with their gender identity \ngenerally would not violate Title IX.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,536-37 (citing Memorandum re: Bostock \nv. Clayton Cnty. 1 (Jan. 8, 2021), perma.cc/CJE3-GH52); 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,807, 33,820 (main-\ntaining that the prior memorandum is wrong). And the Department is currently investigating \na school for not forcing students to use a classmate’s preferred pronouns. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n26 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 27 of 84\n33,516 (not responding to a comment asking the Department to explain “a recent resolution \nletter finding that a school district violated Title IX when it failed to effectively respond to \nmisgendering of a student”). Schools will understand that, if they deviate from the Depart-\nment’s rule, they can be investigated and punished by the Department too, risking their repu-\ntation and their federal funding. \n77.  This new definition of sexual harassment applies in the broadest possible way, \nextending to conduct that occurs online, off campus, outside the United States, or even before \nany of the individuals attended the school. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886, 33,527, 33,886. \n78.  The rule’s prohibition on “retaliation” exacerbates its breadth. The rule requires \nrecipients to “prohibit retaliation, including peer retaliation,” defined extraordinarily broadly. \nId. at 33,896 (34 C.F.R. §106.71). Under the rule, “retaliation” means “intimidation, threats, \ncoercion, or discrimination against any person” for making a complaint or participating in an \ninvestigation. Id. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2). \nC.   The challenged rule eliminates procedural safeguards for the \naccused. \n79.   The rule makes several changes that restrict students’ ability to defend them-\nselves from accusations of misconduct under Title IX. The rule, among other changes, elimi-\nnates an accused’s right to a live hearing, right to cross-examination of the accuser or other \nwitnesses, right to fairly access all evidence, protection against a recipient’s use of a single-\ninvestigator model, and right to have investigations start with a written complaint. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,891-95 (34 C.F.R. §§106.45-46). Instead of these protections, the rule lets recipients \nquestion the witnesses outside of a hearing; provide only a “description of the relevant and \nnot otherwise impermissible evidence”; have one person serve as the investigator, factfinder, \n27 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 28 of 84\nand discipliner; and start an investigation with an oral statement. Id. Many of these changes, \nsuch as the elimination of the live-hearing right and the authorization to use the single-inves-\ntigator model, have been almost universally condemned, including by the ACLU. See ACLU \nComment on U.S. Department of Education’s Final Title IX Rule, Press Release (Apr. 19, 2024), \nperma.cc/8XWJ-54FK. \n80.  To begin with, the rule eliminates the accused’s right to a live hearing at post-\nsecondary institutions. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,895 (34 C.F.R. §106.46(g)). Under the 2020 rule, \nstudents accused of Title IX misconduct had the right to defend themselves in person. Now, \ntheir colleges or universities have full discretion whether to deny requests for in-person hear-\nings, and thus meaningful cross-examination. \n81.  Even if schools give the accused some sort of hearing, the accused, through an \nadvisor, still does not have a right to cross-examine the accuser or witnesses. Instead, the rule \nrequires only “a process … that enables the decisionmaker to question parties and witnesses \nto adequately assess a party’s or witness’s credibility to the extent credibility is both in dispute \nand relevant.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(f)-(g)). \n82.  The rule also limits the opportunity for parties to present witnesses. Parties can \npresent “fact witnesses” that are “relevant and not otherwise impermissible” but no longer \nexpert witnesses. Id. at 33,892 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(f)(2)); id. at 33,594. And the Title IX coor-\ndinator gets to determine whether the fact witness is “relevant” and permissible. Cf. Doe v. \nBrandeis Univ., 177 F. Supp. 3d 561, 606 (D. Mass. 2016) (letting a due-process claim go forward \nwhere the dean “refused to refer any of John’s additional facts, witnesses, or affidavit to the \nSpecial Examiner for further consideration”). \n28 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 29 of 84\n83.  The rule removes the right of students to inspect all the evidence against them. \nThe rule instead allows the parties to access a mere “description” of the “relevant and not \notherwise impermissible evidence” unless the parties go out of their way to request an “equal \nopportunity  to  access”  the  evidence.  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,892-94  (34  C.F.R.  §§106.45(f), \n106.46(e)). And even then, the evidence does not include whatever the decisionmaker has \ndecided is “relevant and not otherwise impermissible.” Id. at 33,892. \n84.  The rule also limits when schools can give accused students the benefit of a \nhigher burden of proof. Under the 2020 rule, schools could adopt the preponderance-of-the-\nevidence standard or the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard as long as the standard was \nthe same for students and employees. 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,575. The challenged rule now only \nlets recipients use a higher burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence) if they use that \nhigher burden “in all other comparable proceedings, including proceedings relating to other \ndiscrimination complaints.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(h)(1)).  \n85.  The rule states that college and university students accused of misconduct no \nlonger have a right to have an advisor (lawyer) participate at all proceedings. Instead, the rule \nallows postsecondary schools to limit their attendance. Id. at 33,894 (34 C.F.R. §106.46(e)(2)); \nsee id. (“the postsecondary institution may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which \nthe advisor may participate in the grievance procedures, as long as the restrictions apply equally \nto the parties”); id. at 33,720 (“restrictions on advocates are … common and … necessary to \nensure orderly and efficient functioning”). The only requirement is that, if the accused has \ncounsel, then the accuser must get counsel too (even though it’s the accused, rather than the \naccuser, whose need for counsel is particularly acute). Id. at 33,894. \n29 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 30 of 84\n86.  The rule permits a single-investigator model. The Department will no longer \nrequire separation between the Title IX investigator and the decisionmaker. Id. at 33,891 \n(§106.45(b)(2)). Instead, these roles can all fall under the umbrella of a single employee. In \nother words, the same individual can hear the original allegations, decide whether to investi-\ngate, do the investigation, evaluate the evidence, and make a final decision.  \n87.  The rule now allows an investigation to begin without any formal written com-\nplaint. Instead, a recipient need only receive an “oral” statement that a recipient can “objec-\ntively” understand as a “request” to “investigate.” Id. at 33,882 (34 C.F.R. §106.2). Perhaps \nworse, the rule now permits the Title IX coordinator to initiate a grievance procedure even in \n“the absence of a complaint or the withdrawal of any or all of the allegations in a complaint.” \nId. at 33,889 (§106.44(f)(1)(v)). The coordinator must make “this fact-specific determination” \nby considering many factors, including “reasonable safety concerns,” “[t]he risk that additional \nacts of sex discrimination would occur if a complaint is not initiated,” “[t]he age and relation-\nship of the parties,” and “[t]he availability of evidence.” Id. (§106.44(f)(1)(v)(A)). \n88.  The rule thus empowers Title IX coordinators to go beyond their mandatory \nreporting duties and, in their discretion, police activities on campus that they determine con-\nstitute sex discrimination. Given the rule’s overall breadth, this provision appears to give Title \nIX coordinators and other employees the power to open investigations and start proceedings \nbased solely on what they have heard. \n89.  Even if some of these procedures are technically optional, schools will adopt \nthem once the 2020 rule is repealed and replaced. Many agree with them as a matter of policy. \nSee Comment on Docket No. ED-2021-OCR-0166, at 61, FIRE (Sept. 12, 2022), perma.cc/PJX5-\n30 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 31 of 84\nRZ3G (“FIRE’s research shows that when not required to provide a live hearing, the majority \nof institutions, regardless of their size, do not. Of the 50 surveyed institutions in FIRE’s 2021 \nSpotlight on Due Process report with non-Title IX sexual misconduct policies, 33 (66%) did \nnot guarantee a meaningful hearing.” (citing 2021-22 Spotlight on Campus Due Process, FIRE \n(2022), perma.cc/N7SF-8TH7)). And they will reasonably fear enforcement actions or inves-\ntigations from the Department for having inadequate procedures. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,636; \nDoe v. Univ. of Scis., 961 F.3d 203, 213 & n.6 (3d Cir. 2020) (describing how through enforce-\nment  actions  the  Department  has  coerced  schools  into  adopting  the  single-investigator \nmodel). \nIV.   Plaintiffs and this litigation \n90.  Each of the State Plaintiffs (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina) and \nthe Private Plaintiffs (IWLC, IWN, PDE, and Speech First) will suffer concrete injuries as a \ndirect result of the Department’s rule. \n91.  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Each of the State Plaintiffs \ntake federal funds for education programs or activities, subjecting them to Title IX. See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,541 (“[A]ll 50 States have accepted Federal funding for education programs or ac-\ntivities and are subject to Title IX as to those programs and activities.”). If any program or \nactivity at one of their covered institutions is determined not to comply, the Department can \nterminate federal funding. Noncompliance with the rule thus would cause the States to risk \nbillions of dollars of federal funding for education. That loss of federal funds would require \nthese institutions either to eliminate certain educational services or to seek new funding to pay \n31 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 32 of 84\nfor those services. And enforcement proceedings—even just investigations by the federal gov-\nernment—are expensive, time-consuming, and distracting for schools, school districts, school \nofficials, and the State. \n92.  Compliance with the new rule, however, will be burdensome and costly. The \nrule is over a thousand pages long; it will take substantial time and money to review the rule \nand existing policies, to determine what the rule requires, and to act to come into compliance \nwith it. To take just one example, virtually every public university in the Plaintiff States has a \nTitle IX policy that tracks the 2020 rule—the lengthy regulation that this new rule will repeal \nand replace. Similarly, public-school districts in the Plaintiff States have Title IX policies that \nare Davis-compliant and that will need to be changed to comply with the rule. All those policies \nwill have to be reviewed, rewritten, and reapproved, which is costly and burdensome. It will \nalso take time and money to train officials on the rule and the new policies implementing it. \n93.  The rule also substantially expands recipients’ enforcement obligations. The rule \nnot only adds responsibility over gender identity and sexual orientation and expands the defi-\nnition of harassment, but also requires recipients “to promptly and effectively end any sex \ndiscrimination in its education program or activity, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its ef-\nfects”—even when not deliberately indifferent, even when there is no complaint (oral or writ-\nten), and even when the complaint is withdrawn. And it requires recipients to provide sup-\nportive measures when there is no complaint, during investigations and grievance procedures, \nand even after a complaint is dismissed. Following these broader requirements is more oner-\nous than following the current, narrower ones. If the rule goes into effect, compliance costs \nand burdens for the Plaintiff States’ schools will increase substantially. \n32 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 33 of 84\n94.  The Department agrees. It estimates that the compliance costs will be “$4.6 \nmillion to $18.8 million over ten years.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,851, 33,861. It “acknowledges” that \n“it will take some time to review requirements and revise policies and procedures to align with \n[the rule’s] requirements.” Id. at 33,851. It will cost “time” and money “reading and under-\nstanding the regulations; revising policies; publishing notices of nondiscrimination; training \nTitle IX Coordinators; updating training materials;” “conduct[ing] additional training”; and \nmore. Id. at 33,851, 33,548. The Department also admits that recipients will see “an increase \nin Title IX complaints” they must administer, a “10 percent increase in the number of inves-\ntigations” they must conduct, an “increase” in the “supportive measures” they must provide, \nand an “increase” in “responsiveness to all reports and complaints of sex discrimination.” Id. \nat 33,483, 33,492, 33,850, 33,862, 33,868-69. These estimates are overly conservative at best. \n95.  Each of the State Plaintiffs have adopted their laws, policies, and practices and \nestablished sex-specific restrooms, showers, residence halls, locker rooms, and other living \nfacilities in reliance on longstanding Department regulations that Title IX and its implementing \nregulations permit these laws, policies, and practices. The challenged rule upsets those reliance \ninterests. \n96.  The rule conflicts with many of the State Plaintiffs’ laws that govern public in-\nstitutions of higher education and primary and secondary education, including laws involving \n33 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 34 of 84\nharassment,1 bathrooms,2 sports,3 parental rights,4 and more.5 The rule thus impedes the State \nPlaintiffs’ sovereign authority to enforce and administer their laws and creates pressure on the \nState Plaintiffs to change their laws and practices. \n \n1 See, e.g., Ala. Code §16-68-2(4) (“Harassment. Expression that is so severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive that it effectively denies access to an educational opportunity or ben-\nefit provided by the public institution of higher education.”); Ala. Code §16-68-3(a)(10) (“That \nthe public institution of higher education shall prohibit harassment in a manner consistent \nwith the definition provided in this chapter, and no more expansively than provided herein.”); \nGa. Code Ann. §20-4-11.1(a)(5) (“‘Student-on-student harassment’ means unwelcome con-\nduct or expressive activity directed at a student that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that a student is effectively denied equal access to educational opportunities or ben-\nefits provided by the public institution of higher education. This term shall not apply to or \ngovern any employment policy of a public institution of higher education relating to harass-\nment.”). \n2 See, e.g., Ala. Code §16-1-54(b) (“A public K-12 school shall require every multiple \noccupancy restroom or changing area designated for student use to be used by individuals \nbased on their biological sex.”); Fla. Stat. Ann. §553.865 (same); Rule 20, Collier County Public \nSchools, perma.cc/9TCE-HBNU (same); Policy 5.08: Bathrooms, Locker Rooms and Overnight \nTrips, Duval County Public Schools, perma.cc/8RRG-ZPDD (same). \n3 See, e.g., Ala. Code §16-1-52 (“Participation in athletic events to be based on biological \nsex of athletes.”); Fla. Stat. Ann. §1006.205 (same); S.C. Code Ann. §59-1-500 (same). \n4 See, e.g., Ala. Code §26-26-5 (“No nurse, counselor, teacher, principal, or other admin-\nistrative official at a public or private school attended by a minor shall do either of the follow-\ning: (1) Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from the minor’s parent or legal guardian \nthe fact that the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor’s \nsex. (2) Withhold from a minor’s parent or legal guardian information related to a minor’s \nperception that his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with his or her sex.”); Fla. Stat. Ann. \n§1014.01-06 (Parents’ Bill of Rights); Ga. Code §20-2-786 (Parents’ Bill of Rights). \n5 See, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. §1000.071(1)-(2) (“It shall be the policy of every public K-12 \neducational institution that is provided or authorized by the Constitution and laws of Florida \nthat a person’s sex is an immutable biological trait and that it is false to ascribe to a person a \npronoun that does not correspond to such person’s sex…. An employee, contractor, or stu-\ndent of a public K-12 educational institution may not be required, as a condition of employ-\nment or enrollment or participation in any program, to refer to another person using that \nperson’s preferred personal title or pronouns if such personal title or pronouns do not corre-\nspond to that person’s sex.”). \n34 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 35 of 84\n97.  The rule also exposes the State Plaintiffs, their universities, and their K-12 \nschools to litigation costs and liability. Lawsuits are expensive, time-consuming, and distracting \nfor schools, school officials, and the State. And the threat of liability, including large awards \nof attorney’s fees, can be devastating. \n98.  By expanding the definition of harassment and removing deliberate indifference \nas a liability requirement, the rule puts universities in a catch-22. If they do not adopt the \nDepartment’s new definition of harassment, then they risk enforcement actions by the De-\npartment. But if they do adopt the Department’s definition, then they risk lawsuits alleging \nthat the definition violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. For example, Alabama, \nFlorida, and Georgia sit in the Eleventh Circuit, which has already held that a harassment \npolicy like the one mandated by the rule is likely unconstitutional. See Cartwright, 32 F.4th at \n1110. \n99.  The same is true for the rule’s provisions reducing procedural protections for \nthe accused. Some of these procedures are mandatory. And though some purport to be op-\ntional, schools will feel substantial pressure to adopt them because the Department can and \nhas brought enforcement actions against recipients who lack them. But if recipients decrease \nprocedural protections for the accused, they risk litigation for sex-based discrimination or due-\nprocess violations. Federal courts have found these claims viable. E.g., Doe v. Purdue Univ., 928 \nF.3d 652 (7th Cir. 2019); Univ. of Scis., 961 F.3d 203; Schwake v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 967 F.3d \n940 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., 23 F.4th 930 (9th Cir. 2022). \n100.  The same is also true for the rule’s redefinition of “sex discrimination” to in-\nclude gender identity. The rule requires eliminating female-only spaces, even in sensitive areas \n35 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 36 of 84\nlike bathrooms and locker rooms, which the Eleventh Circuit has said implicates women’s \n“right” to privacy. Adams, 57 F.4th at 804-08. Lawsuits alleging violations of the constitutional \nright to privacy have already been filed against schools that adopted the same policy. E.g., Doe \nex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518 (3d Cir. 2018). Other courts, moreover, \nhave held that school policies against students “misgendering” other students violate the First \nAmendment. E.g., PDE v. Linn Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 83 F.4th 658, 666-69 (8th Cir. 2023) (K-\n12). And constitutional lawsuits have been filed against schools that refuse to notify or tell \nparents information about their children’s professed gender identity at school. E.g., Willey v. \nSweetwater Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Trustees, 680 F. Supp. 3d 1250, 1275-78 (D. Wyo. 2023); \nRicard v. USD 475 Geary Cnty., KS Sch. Bd., 2022 WL 1471372, at *7-9 (D. Kan. May 9); Linn \nMar, 83 F.3d at 665-66. \n101.  The Department, again, acknowledges these costs. Though it unrealistically \nminimizes the problem, it admits that each key component of the rule will impose on recipients \nat least “some … costs associated with litigation.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,851 (definition of har-\nassment), 33,858 (inclusion of gender identity), 33,876 (enforcement procedures). \n102.  The State Plaintiffs also have less control over the policies and practices of their \nprivate schools, and no control over schools in other States where thousands of their students \nattend with the intent to come back. Yet the rule will directly change the policies and practices \nat those schools. The State Plaintiffs have a substantial interest in ensuring that none of their \nfemale students are discriminated against by being forced to compete against men in athletics \nor share sensitive and private spaces with them. And it harms the State Plaintiffs if their stu-\n36 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 37 of 84\ndents’ educations—and ability to come back and contribute to their economies—are compro-\nmised by policies that prevent the free exchange of ideas or that punish students without ad-\nequate process. \n103.  Each Plaintiff State submitted comments urging the Department not to uproot \nthe 2020 rule. See Montana’s Comment Regarding Docket ID ED-2021-OCR-0166, RIN 1870-AA16 \n(Sept. 12, 2022), perma.cc/J798-EPFM (joined by Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina); \nTennessee’s Comment Regarding Docket ID ED-2021-OCR-0166, RIN 1870-AA16 (Sept. 12, 2022), \nperma.cc/C7KM-4LHD (joined by Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina); Florida’s Comment \nRegarding Docket ID ED-2021-OCR-0166, RIN 1870-AA16 (Sept. 12, 2022), perma.cc/3UNA-\nCFNK. \n104.  Independent Women’s Law Center & Independent Women’s Network. \nIWLC and IWN have spent substantial time and resources defending the Trump administra-\ntion’s Title IX rule—the same 2020 rule that the Biden administration is now repealing. IWLC \nintervened in Pennsylvania v. Devos to defend the 2020 rule, see Minute Order, No. 1:20-cv-01468 \n(D.D.C. July 6, 2020), and the court upheld that rule as lawful, 480 F. Supp. 3d 47 (D.D.C. \n2020). IWLC also helped defeat proposals to delay the 2020 rule’s effective date. See Letter to \nSecretary  DeVos  and  Assistant  Secretary  Marcus,  IWLC  &  Speech  First  (Apr.  9,  2020), \nperma.cc/4ME3-43CS.

IWN  has  members  who  are  current  students  at  colleges  and  universities \nthroughout the United States, including within the Plaintiff States. Many of these members \nare current athletes for their colleges. \n106.  Regina Baird is a freshman at Ave Maria University in Florida. She competes \nfor her college team in track and cross country, primarily running in the 800, 1500, and 5,000 \nmeter races. Her school participates in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. \nThe NAIA currently does not allow biological males to participate in women’s sports. Baird \nhas participated in nearly a dozen NAIA meets in Florida. \n107.  Savvy Barbosa and Sarah Scott are freshmen at another university in Florida. \nSavvy plays goalkeeper and Sarah plays midfield on their school’s women’s lacrosse team. The \nteam competes across the country. The 2024 season is ongoing with 16 games played so far, \nincluding in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. \n108.  Mary Grace Tibbs is a freshman at Virginia Commonwealth University. She \nplays midfield on her college’s women’s lacrosse team. VCU’s team competes across the coun-\ntry. The 2024 season is ongoing with 17 games played so far, including in Virginia, Pennsylva-\nnia, North Carolina, D.C., Massachusetts, and New York. \n38 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 39 of 84\n109.  Haley Olive is a freshman at Webber International University in Florida. She \nplays for her college’s lacrosse team. Webber’s team participates in the NAIA, which again \ncurrently does not allow biological males to participate in women’s sports. The 2024 season is \nongoing with 16 games played so far, including in Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Mis-\nsouri, and Georgia. \n110.  IWN’s members support the scientific consensus that, like most mammals, hu-\nman beings are born either male or female and that it is not possible to “become” male or \nfemale based on subjective feelings, cosmetics, style of dress, medication, or surgical proce-\ndures. They do not want to be forced to “affirm” that a man is really a “woman” just because \nhe decides to identify or present as one. \n111.  The new rule will allow biological men who identify as women to compete in \nwomen’s sports. It requires—or will predictably coerce—schools to allow biological males to \ncompete on athletic teams for women or girls, denying IWN’s members and other female \nstudents equal athletic opportunities, resources, playing time, and fair competition.  \n112.  IWN’s members do not want to compete against biological males in their sports, \nas they believe that allowing males to compete in women’s sports is unfair and unsafe. \n113.  Nor do they want to compete with biological males on their teams, as they or \none or more of their female teammates would lose a roster spot, playing time, opportunities \nto compete, access to resources, and, in some cases, awards and potential scholarships. They \nbelieve that allowing males to take athletic opportunities, resources, and awards from female \nathletes is wrong and even discriminates against females in violation of Title IX.  \n39 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 40 of 84\n114.  IWN’s members do not believe that biological males should be able to share \ntraditionally female-only spaces with women, such as locker rooms and other sensitive spaces. \nThe rule requires schools to adopt policies that let men use women’s most sensitive spaces \nbased on an asserted, presumably feminine, gender identity. These policies impinge on IWN’s \nmembers’ privacy interests in using locker rooms away from the opposite sex and in shielding \ntheir bodies from the opposite sex. Individuals have a privacy interest when their nude or \npartially nude bodies are exposed to others, especially when persons of the opposite sex are \npresent. Allowing males into female-only spaces puts women’s safety at risk and has the po-\ntential to harm them mentally, emotionally, and psychologically.  \n115.  IWN’s members do not want to share locker rooms or other sensitive spaces \nwith biological males, and they do not consent to such practices. IWN’s members believe that \na school that forces female athletes to undress in front of naked male athletes without their \nconsent has committed unlawful sexual harassment in violation of Title IX. \n116.  The challenged rule will also subject IWN’s members to speech codes and dis-\nciplinary procedures on their campuses and in their leagues.  \n117.  IWN’s members want to be able to have open and robust intellectual debates \nand discussions about controversial issues—such as biological males participating in women’s \nsports or using women’s spaces based on their gender identity. And they want to be able to \nengage in discourse surrounding these topics on campus, in their community, and online. \nWhen a fellow athlete, classmate, or another member of the university community voices con-\ntrary views about these and other controversial topics, IWN’s members want to point out the \nflaws in their arguments and attempt to change their minds. IWN’s members want to speak \n40 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 41 of 84\ndirectly to their classmates about these topics, and they want to talk frequently and repeatedly \non these issues. Given their views, IWN’s members know that many of these conversations \nwill be heated, passionate, and targeted. But they want to have these conversations because \nthey feel strongly about these issues. If the rule challenged in this case becomes effective, \nhowever, IWN’s members will limit their speech because they reasonably fear that their speech \nwill be considered “harassment” or “misgendering” under the policies that the rule requires \nuniversities to adopt. \n118.  IWLC believes that all college students—the majority of whom today are fe-\nmale—benefit from a fair and unbiased process for adjudicating claims of sex discrimination \non campus. The challenged rule, however, is anything but fair or unbiased.  \n119.  The challenged rule will divert IWLC’s resources in ways that hinder its ability \nto accomplish its mission. Before the 2020 rule took effect, IWLC spent significant resources \neducating students on their due-process rights on campus and doing investigative reporting \non kangaroo courts adjudicating sexual-harassment complaints. When the 2020 rule became \neffective, IWLC was able to spend its resources on other issues, such as defending women’s \nsports, the First Amendment rights of college and K-12 students, and the privacy rights of \nwomen through litigation and other means. If the challenged rule becomes effective, IWLC \nwill be forced to divert these resources back to assisting students and faculty who are accused \nunder vague and subjective sexual-harassment policies without adequate procedural protec-\ntions. \n120.  Parents Defending Education. PDE filed comments in response to the De-\npartment’s notice of proposed rulemaking here, which preceded the challenged rule. Comments \n41 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 42 of 84\non the Department of Education’s Request for Comments Regarding the Proposed Amendments to the Regu-\nlations  Implementing  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972,  PDE  (Sept.  12,  2022), \nperma.cc/CZ5Y-WR3G. PDE’s specific concerns—and its litigation—are referenced in the \nfinal rule. \n121.  PDE uses litigation to challenge unconstitutional policies at primary and sec-\nondary schools. PDE has challenged policies across the country that violate free-speech and \nparental rights—including bias policies, PDE v. Wellesley Pub. Sch., No. 1:21-cv-11709 (D. Mass. \nDec. 8, 2021); speech codes, Linn Mar, 83 F.4th 658; and policies that hide information about \nstudents’ gender identities from their parents, id. But litigation is expensive and time-consum-\ning; any attorney’s fees that PDE has recovered were only a small fraction of its expenses. \n122.  The challenged rule changes the operative definition of “sexual harassment” \nunder Title IX for so-called hostile-environment harassment. One clear takeaway is that \nschools must now prohibit “misgendering,” where a student refuses to use others’ “preferred \npronouns” instead of the pronouns that match their biological sex. Worse, the rule makes clear \nthat a single instance of intentional or purposeful misgendering can violate the Department’s \ndefinition. As can a repeated, but non-severe, practice of misgendering. \n123.  Primary and secondary schools must—and predictably will—change their Title \nIX policies to ban harassment that satisfies this new definition, including misgendering. Pri-\nmary and secondary schools will understand that, if they deviate from the Department’s rule, \nthey can be investigated and punished by the Department too, risking their reputation and \ntheir federal funding. \n42 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 43 of 84\n124.  PDE and other groups who defend students’ rights believe the challenged rule’s \nnew definition of harassment is facially unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments, especially with respect to misgendering. \n125.  The challenged rule declares that it trumps parents’ rights, including their right \nto access their child’s information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and \nstate laws. Commenters pressed concerns that the rule would bar a recipient from “treat[ing] \na student according to their” biological sex “if requested by the parents to do so,” “notify[ing] \na student’s parents of the student’s gender transition or gender identity,” or letting parents \naccess “their child’s educational records, including information about their child’s gender iden-\ntity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821. Rather than deny these concerns, the Department concedes that \nthe rule can require such results, even when state law requires these parental rights.  \n126.  When K-12 schools adopt unconstitutional policies that violate the parental \nrights of PDE’s members or chill the speech of their children, PDE challenges those policies \nin court. E.g., Linn Mar, 83 F.4th at 658; Olentangy, 2023 WL 4848509, at *1; Wellesley, No. 1:21-\ncv-11709 (D. Mass.). PDE’s members also benefit from state laws, like Iowa’s, that give par-\nents a right to know and participate in decisions about their child’s gender identity at school. \nSee Linn Mar, 83 F.4th at 665 (discussing Iowa Code §279.78 (2023)). \n127.  PDE’s lawsuits have resulted in settlements that ensure these policies stay off \nthe books. For example, Linn-Mar settled with PDE and agreed to “rescin[d]” and “not rein-\nstate” a policy that prohibited “‘an intentional and/or persistent refusal by staff or students to \nrespect a student’s gender identity.’” Settlement Agreement ¶1 (Doc. 57-1), Linn Mar, No. \n1:22-cv-78 (Feb. 21, 2024). The challenged rule effectively undoes that bargain by forcing \n43 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 44 of 84\nschools, including Linn-Mar, to adopt policies that ban the same speech. And it purports to \noverride both FERPA and state laws, like Iowa’s, that give parents a right to information about \ntheir child’s claimed gender identity at school. All of this harms PDE’s members, several of \nwhom have children that still attend Linn-Mar. See Linn Mar, 83 F.4th at 664. \n128.  The challenged rule also will divert PDE’s resources in ways that harm its mis-\nsion. For example, as a direct result of the rule’s publication, PDE’s tip line is experiencing a \nsurge in calls from concerned parents about the safety of their children, and this surge will \nonly worsen as the rule coerces school districts into adopting unlawful policies. Under the rule, \nmoreover, exponentially more K-12 schools will prohibit misgendering under Title IX and \nstop notifying parents about their child’s claimed gender identity at school—ballooning the \nnumber of schools that are violating the rights of PDE’s members. This upending of the status \nquo will require PDE to divert its finite resources toward suing (or re-suing) schools. These \ndiversions will prevent PDE from using its resources on other projects, including combating \nantisemitism at additional K-12 schools and launching new investigations to reveal connec-\ntions between schools in the United States and foreign countries. \n129.  The challenged rule will cause public primary and secondary schools to adopt \npolicies that violate the constitutional rights of PDE’s members and their children. PDE has \nmembers whose children currently attend public schools across the United States, including \nin the Plaintiff States. PDE has over 700 members within Alabama, Florida, and Georgia \nalone.  \n130.  For example, A.B. is a Georgian whose children currently attend a Georgia pub-\nlic school. B.W. is a Floridian whose children currently attend a Florida public school. And \n44 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 45 of 84\nA.O. is a Floridian whose child currently attends a Florida public school. These parents’ chil-\ndren will attend schools in these States next year too. For now, these schools do not have a \npolicy that prohibits, for example, “misgendering.” \n131.  PDE’s members and their children hold a wide array of different views and \nopinions on matters such as politics, religion, “gender identity”, and many other sensitive and \ncontroversial topics concerning sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. These traditional \nviews are unpopular, controversial, and in the minority at their schools.  \n132.  A.B. believes that people are either male or female. A.B. acknowledges that \nsome people suffer from gender dysphoria. A.B. believes there is a difference between gender \ndysphoria, which is historically rare, and a child’s confusion about their gender, which can lead \na child to adopt a different name, pronouns, clothing, and so forth. A.B. also believes that \nconfusion about gender can be a part of adolescence and that it does not always persist beyond \nadolescence. A.B. believes that these issues are sensitive and should be left to families to dis-\ncuss and resolve, not to schools. \n133.  A.B. has taught her children that biological sex is immutable and cannot change \nbased on someone’s internal feelings. A.B. has taught her children to always tell the truth, even \nwhen doing so is unpopular.  \n134.  A.B.’s children believe that sex is immutable and that a child cannot “transition” \nfrom one sex to another. A.B.’s children do not want to be forced to “affirm” that a biologi-\ncally female classmate is actually a male—or vice versa—or that a classmate is “nonbinary,” \nmeaning neither male nor female. Doing so would contradict the deeply held beliefs of A.B.’s \nfamily, including A.B.’s beliefs that she has imparted to her children and her children’s own \n45 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 46 of 84\nsincerely held beliefs. A.B. and her children also believe that a biological male who identifies \nas female should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports and that it is an invasion of \nprivacy for students to share bathrooms with the opposite biological sex. \n135.  B.W. believes that sex is immutable and that people are either male or female. \nB.W. believes that there is a difference between gender dysphoria and a child’s confusion about \ntheir gender, which can lead a child to adopt a different name, pronouns, clothing, and so on. \nB.W. also believes that confusion about gender can be a part of adolescence and that it does \nnot always persist beyond adolescence. B.W. believes that these issues of gender are sensitive \nand should be left to families to discuss and resolve, not to schools. B.W. has taught his chil-\ndren that biological sex is immutable and that gender does not exist on a spectrum, as many \npeople now claim. B.W. has also taught his children to share their beliefs and tell the truth.  \n136.  B.W.’s children believe that people are either male or female and that biological \nsex is unchangeable. They do not want to be forced to “affirm” that a biologically male class-\nmate is actually a female—or vice versa—or that a classmate is “nonbinary,” meaning neither \nmale nor female. They wish to use pronouns consistent with a classmate’s biological sex re-\npeatedly and at all times, including inside and outside the classroom, and in and out of the \nclassmate’s presence. Being forced to do otherwise would contradict the deeply held beliefs of \nB.W.’s family, including his beliefs that he has imparted to his children. \n137.  A.O. believes that people are either male or female and that a child cannot \n“transition” from one sex to another. He acknowledges that gender dysphoria exists but be-\nlieves it is historically a rare condition. He believes there is a difference between gender dys-\nphoria and a child’s confusion about gender, which can lead a child to adopt a different name, \n46 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 47 of 84\npronouns, and clothing. He also thinks that confusion about gender can be a part of adoles-\ncence and that it does not always persist beyond adolescence. He believes that a biological \nmale who identifies as female should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports and that \nit is an invasion of privacy for students to share bathrooms with the opposite biological sex. \nFurther, A.O. has and imparts to his children traditional views about marriage. A.O. believes \nthat issues of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are sensitive and should be left to \nfamilies to discuss and resolve, not to schools. When they arise at school, A.O. wants his child \nto express all these opinions that he has instilled in his child. \n138.  A.O. does not want his child to be forced to “affirm” that a biologically female \nclassmate is actually a male—or vice versa—or that a classmate is “nonbinary” and neither \nmale nor female. Specifically, A.O. does not want his child to use pronouns consistent with a \nclassmate’s biological sex repeatedly and at all times, including inside and outside the class-\nroom, and in and out of the classmate’s presence.  \n139.  PDE’s members and their children want to be able to have open and robust \nintellectual debates and discussions about these issues at school and in their communities. \nWhen a classmate or another member of the school community voices contrary views about \nthese and other controversial topics, PDE’s members and their children want to point out the \nflaws in their arguments and convince them to change their minds. PDE’s members and their \nchildren want to speak directly about these topics, and they want to talk frequently and repeat-\nedly on these issues. Given their views, PDE’s members and their children know that many \nof these conversations will be heated, passionate, and targeted. But they want to have these \nconversations because they feel strongly about these issues. \n47 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 48 of 84\n140.  PDE’s members and their children will be subject to the policies and practices \nthat the challenged rule causes their schools to adopt. Their children will limit their speech \nbecause they reasonably fear it will be considered “harassment” or “misgendering.” From self-\ncensoring, their children will steadily lose self-esteem, self-confidence, and the educational \nbenefits of free-flowing debate and the exchange of ideas. \n141.  If the challenged rule becomes effective, PDE’s members will be unable to ef-\nfectively exercise their fundamental rights as parents to guide the upbringing of their children \nand to instill their children with important values. The rule will give PDE’s members constant \nanxiety that their children will be questioned or punished for the views they wish to express \nand forced to violate their privacy by sharing restrooms with the opposite sex. Being threat-\nened for stating their fundamental beliefs will inflict mental and psychological harm on their \nchildren by forcing them to “choose” between expressing their beliefs and following the rules. \nThe rule will prevent PDE’s members from directing their children to seek and facilitate open, \nrobust intellectual discussions with other students related to science, religion, gender identity, \nand many other important sex-related topics, with the goal of changing those students’ minds \nor, at the very least, helping those students understand their perspectives. At a minimum, it \nwill force these parents to have difficult discussions about sex and “gender identity” with their \nchildren before the children are ready. \n142.  These members also do not want their children sharing restrooms with mem-\nbers of the opposite sex, regardless of asserted gender identity. Before the challenged rule, \ntheir children attended schools that required all students to use a bathroom that corresponds \nto their biological sex. The rule now requires schools to adopt policies that permit biological \n48 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 49 of 84\nboys to use the girl’s bathroom and biological girls to use the boy’s bathroom, based on their \nasserted gender identity. The rule thus impinges on students’ privacy interests in using the \nbathroom away from the opposite sex and in shielding their bodies from the opposite sex. \nIndividuals have a privacy interest when their nude or partially nude bodies are exposed to \nothers, especially when persons of the opposite sex are present. School-age children are still \ndeveloping emotionally and physically as well, heightening the privacy concerns. The prospect \nof the presence of the opposite sex, let alone their actual presence, would be a significant \nintrusion on PDE’s members’ children’s privacy and would psychologically and emotionally \nharm them.  \n143.  The challenged rule threatens these children’s due-process rights too. Especially \nbecause the rule’s definitions are so broad and vague, PDE’s members’ children could easily \ncross the line and be reported and investigated for harassment or misgendering. Disciplinary \nproceedings without notice of the charges, adjudication by a neutral decisionmaker, cross-\nexamination, and other basic protections are fundamentally unfair and risk erroneous decisions \nwith life-altering consequences for these students. A finding of guilt, or even the opening of \nan investigation, can create a permanent and life-altering stigma that irreparably harms a stu-\ndent’s educational, professional, and social prospects, even if the finding is later reversed or \nthe investigation is dropped. And it severely distracts them from their studies. \n144.  Speech First. Speech First has spent substantial time and resources defending \nthe Trump administration’s Title IX rule—the same 2020 rule that the Biden administration \nis now repealing. Speech First intervened in Pennsylvania v. Devos to defend the 2020 rule, see \nMinute Order, No. 1:20-cv-01468 (D.D.C. July 6, 2020), and that court upheld the 2020 rule \n49 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 50 of 84\nas lawful, 480 F. Supp. 3d 47 (D.D.C. 2020). Speech First also helped defeat proposals to delay \nthe 2020 rule’s effective date. Letter to Secretary DeVos and Assistant Secretary Marcus, IWLC & \nSpeech First (Apr. 9, 2020), perma.cc/4ME3-43CS. And Speech First filed comments in re-\nsponse to the Department’s notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal the 2020 rule here. Com-\nment to Docket ID No. ED-2021-OCR-0166, Speech First (Sept. 9, 2022), perma.cc/JV45-ZCPC. \nSpeech First’s specific concerns—and its litigation—are referenced in the final rule numerous \ntimes. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,501-02, 33,505-06.  \n145.  Speech First uses litigation to challenge unconstitutional speech codes at public \nuniversities. Speech First has used litigation to challenge speech codes across the country—\nincluding, for example, bias-reporting policies, e.g., Cartwright, 32 F.4th at 1122-24; Speech First, \nInc. v. Schlissel, 939 F.3d 756, 763-67 (6th Cir. 2019); computer policies, e.g., Speech First, Inc. v. \nCartwright, 2021 WL 3399829, at *7 (M.D. Fla. July 29, 2021); Speech First, Inc. v. Sands, 2021 \nWL 4315459, at *1 (W.D. Va. Sept. 22); Order (Doc. 33) 19-28, Speech First, Inc. v. McCall, No. \n1:23-cv-411 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 1, 2023); and residence-hall policies, e.g., Speech First, Inc. v. Fenves, \n979 F.3d 319, 324-27 (5th Cir. 2020). But litigation is expensive and time-consuming; Speech \nFirst’s expenses always dwarf the small amount of attorney’s fees it recovers, if it recovers \nthem at all. \n146.  The challenged rule changes the operative definition of “sexual harassment” \nunder Title IX for so-called hostile-environment harassment. Schools must—and predictably \nwill—change their Title IX policies to ban harassment that satisfies this new definition. Uni-\nversities understand that, if they deviate from the Department’s definitions, they can be inves-\ntigated and punished by the Department, risking their reputation and their federal funding. \n50 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 51 of 84\nThe Department has, in fact, used its enforcement authority to force universities to adopt \npolicies that contain its preferred definition of harassment. And after the Trump administra-\ntion issued the 2020 rule, virtually every university adopted that rule’s definition of harassment \nverbatim in their Title IX policies, even though many universities disagreed with that definition \nas a matter of law and policy. \n147.  Speech First and other groups who defend students’ rights believe that the rule’s \nnew definition of harassment is facially unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments. \n148.  When universities adopt unconstitutional harassment policies that chill the \nspeech of Speech First’s members, Speech First challenges those policies in court. E.g., Fenves, \n979 F.3d 319 (University of Texas); Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110 (University of Central Florida); \nKhator, 603 F. Supp. 3d 480 (University of Houston); Speech First, Inc. v. Shrum, 92 F.4th 947 \n(10th Cir. 2024) (Oklahoma State University); Speech First, Inc. v. McCall, No. 23-50633 (5th Cir. \nSept. 6, 2023) (Texas State University). Speech First has won that harassment policies exceed-\ning Davis—including policies virtually identical to the one that the new rule will make univer-\nsities adopt—are unenforceable under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. E.g., Cartwright, \n32 F.4th at 1120-22, 1125-29; Khator, 603 F. Supp. 3d at 481-82. \n149.  In most of these cases, the universities signed settlement agreements with \nSpeech First that brought the school’s harassment policy in line with Davis: \na.  The University of Central Florida agreed to “promptly amend” its har-\nassment policy to comply with Davis and to “not reinstate the version of \nthe policy that Speech First challenged.” Agreement and Release ¶2 \n(Doc. 64), No. 6:21-cv-313 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 23, 2022). \n51 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 52 of 84\nb.  The University of Houston agreed to “not reinstate the version of the \n[Harassment] Policy challenged by Speech First.” Agreement ¶1 (Doc. \n31), No. 4:22-cv-582 (S.D. Tex. June 10, 2022). It agreed to adopt a har-\nassment policy that, with respect to nonemployee students, complies \nwith Davis.  \nc.  The University of Texas agreed to adopt a harassment policy that tracks \nDavis and to not reinstate its harassment policy that exceeded Davis. \nAgreement ¶¶1-2 (Doc. 39), No. 1:18-cv-1078 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 12, \n2020). \nd.  Oklahoma State University also agreed to adopt a harassment policy that \ntracks Davis and to not reinstate its harassment policy that exceeded Da-\nvis. Agreement and Release ¶¶1-2 (Doc. 55), No. 5:23-cv-29 (W.D. Okla. \nApr. 15, 2024). Unlike the other universities, however, Oklahoma State \nrequired Speech First to agree that it would “not challenge” that univer-\nsity’s Title IX policy if that policy adopts the definition of sexual harass-\nment that the Department has now promulgated.  \n150.  The challenged rule will, in critical respects, nullify these settlement agreements \nand deprive Speech First’s members of the benefit of these bargains. The challenged rule in-\nstructs these universities to change their Davis-compliant policies to non-Davis-compliant pol-\nicies, recreating the very regime that Speech First contracted with these universities to elimi-\nnate for sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. \n151.  The challenged rule will also divert Speech First’s resources in ways that harm \nits mission. Under the 2020 rule, several schools had constitutional harassment policies overall \n(because they followed Davis already or lost lawsuits to Speech First); and all schools had con-\nstitutional harassment policies under Title IX (because they adopted the 2020 rule’s Davis-\ncompliant definition). But thanks to the rule, all public universities will have Title IX policies \nthat deviate from Davis, ballooning the number of universities that are violating the First \nAmendment rights of Speech First’s members. This will require Speech First to divert its finite \n52 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 53 of 84\nresources toward suing (or re-suing) universities who adopt the rule’s definition. Those re-\nsources would otherwise be spent launching a new initiative that focuses on shaping legislative \npolicy to better defend students’ speech rights on campuses. This new initiative would include \ndrafting and promoting model policies, reaching out to and working with local organizations \non state-level policy recommendations, participating in local and regional conferences to pro-\nmote Speech First’s work, and reaching out to and meeting with lawmakers and educating \nthem on Speech First’s research findings. \n152.  The challenged rule will also cause universities to violate the constitutional \nrights of Speech First’s members. Speech First has many members who are current students \nat public universities within the United States, including within the Plaintiff States. Speech \nFirst’s members hold a wide array of different views and opinions on politics, religion, gender \nidentity, abortion, and many other sensitive and controversial topics concerning sex, sexual \norientation, and gender identity. Many of those students attend schools where Speech First \nhas reached a favorable settlement that, until the challenged rule, protected their rights. \n153.  A student from Speech First’s case against Oklahoma State, for example, is a \nrising senior. As she explained in that case, she believes that sex is immutable and that there is \nno such thing as a “gender spectrum.” She thinks the exponential growth in adolescents and \nyoung adults who identify as transgender or “non-binary” is evidence that many people now \nclaim a certain “gender identity” because they want attention or affirmation. She believes abor-\ntion is wrong and has strong pro-life views that she wants to express in vivid terms. See generally \nDoc. 3-4, No. 5:23-cv-29 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 10, 2023). \n53 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 54 of 84\n154.  A student from Speech First’s case against Houston is a rising senior. As he \nexplained in that case, he believes that human beings are either male or female, and that some-\none cannot “transition” from one sex to the other based on whether he or she “feels” like a \nman or a woman. He doesn’t want to be forced to call someone a “he” or a “she” (or to use \nsome other form of “preferred pronouns”) just because that person has decided that “their \ntruth” involves being transgender or non-binary. He believes it is deeply unfair to allow bio-\nlogical males who identify as females to compete in women’s sports. He believes that those \nmen are stealing athletic opportunities away from actual women who have earned them. He \nalso has strong beliefs about abortion and marriage that stem from his Christian faith. See \ngenerally Doc. 3-4, No. 4:22-cv-582 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 28, 2022). \n155.  Another student from Speech First’s case against Houston is a rising senior (but \nwho plans to graduate in May 2026). As she explained in that case, she believes that allowing \nbiologically male athletes who identify as female to compete in women’s sports is unjust. Men \nand women have innate physiological differences that cannot be erased simply because some-\none chooses to “identify” as a member of the opposite sex. She believes that school adminis-\ntrators who ignore those differences are prioritizing identity politics and political correctness \nover the interests of women. As a woman, she does not want to be forced to “affirm” that a \nman is really a “woman” just because he decides to identify as one. She also has strong pro-\nlife views that she wants to express in vivid terms. See generally Doc. 3-6, No. 4:22-cv-582 (S.D. \nTex. Feb. 28, 2022). \n156.  A student from Speech First’s case against the University of Central Florida is \na rising senior. She believes that human beings are created either male or female, and that \n54 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 55 of 84\nsomeone cannot “transition” from one sex to the other based on whether they “feel” that they \nare a man or a woman. She doesn’t want to be forced to call someone a “he” or a “she” (or to \nuse some other form of “preferred pronouns”) just because that person has decided that “their \ntruth” is that their “real gender” is male or female or “non-binary.” As a woman, she believes \nit is deeply unfair to allow biological males who identify as females to compete in women’s \nsports. These men are taking athletic opportunities away from actual female athletes who de-\nserve them. She also has strong pro-life views that she wants to express in vivid terms. \n157.  Speech First’s members, including the students above, want to be able to have \nopen and robust intellectual debates and discussions about these issues on campus, in their \ncommunity, and online. When a classmate or another member of the university community \nvoices contrary views about these and other controversial topics, Speech First’s members want \nto point out the flaws in their arguments and convince them to change their minds. Speech \nFirst’s members want to speak directly to their classmates about these topics, and they want \nto talk frequently and repeatedly on these issues. Given their views, Speech First’s members \nknow that many of these conversations will be heated, passionate, and targeted. But they want \nto have these conversations because they feel strongly about these issues.  \n158.  The rule challenged in this case will subject Speech First’s members to speech \ncodes and the risk of discipline on their campuses. Speech First’s members will limit their \nspeech if the rule becomes effective because they reasonably fear that their speech will be \nconsidered “harassment” under the policies and practices that the rule requires their universi-\n55 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 56 of 84\nties to adopt. They will be especially reluctant to openly express their opinions or have con-\nversations about controversial topics related to sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation. \nHence why they helped Speech First challenge virtually identical policies in prior litigation. \n159.  The challenged rule also eliminates an accused’s right to a live hearing, his right \nto cross-examination of the accuser or other witnesses, his right to fairly access all evidence, \nhis protection against a recipient’s use of a “single-investigator model,” and the requirement \nthat a written complaint starts an investigation. The challenged rule empowers recipients to \nquestion the witnesses outside of a hearing; provide only a “description of the relevant and \nnot otherwise impermissible evidence”; have one person serve as the investigator, factfinder, \nand discipliner; and start an investigation with an oral statement. Even if some of these pro-\ncedures are technically optional, universities will adopt them once the 2020 rule is repealed \nand replaced. Many agree with them as a matter of policy. And they will reasonably fear en-\nforcement actions or investigations from the Department for having inadequate procedures. \n160.  The challenged rule thus deprives Speech First’s members of their due-process \nrights. These members are current college students on campus now. Especially because the \nrule’s definitions are so broad and vague, Speech First’s members could easily cross the line \nand be reported and investigated for violations of their university’s Title IX policy. Disciplinary \nproceedings without notice of the charges, adjudication by a neutral decisionmaker, cross-\nexamination, and other basic protections are fundamentally unfair and risk erroneous decisions \nwith life-altering consequences for these students. A finding of guilt, or even the opening of \n56 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 57 of 84\nan investigation, can create a permanent and life-altering stigma that irreparably harms a stu-\ndent’s educational, professional, and social prospects, even if the finding is later reversed or \nthe investigation is dropped. And it severely distracts them from their studies. \n161.  Speech First is also harmed by the provision of the rule that changes the defi-\nnition of “sex” to include gender identity and sexual orientation. Absent that change, harass-\nment policies under Title IX could not chill its members’ speech on those topics, and univer-\nsities could not abrogate Speech First’s settlement agreement with respect to those topics. \nCOUNT I \nRedefinition of “Sex” to Include “Gender Identity” and “Sexual Orientation” \n162.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege parts I-II, III.A, and IV.  \n163.  The challenged rule is final agency action under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §704. The \nAPA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capri-\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; “contrary to constitu-\ntional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right.” §706(2). \n164.  The rule, both as a whole and in several particulars, violates the APA. It violates \nTitle IX itself, asserts power that exceeds the agency’s lawful authority, and rests on reasoning \n(or a lack thereof) that is arbitrary and capricious. \n165.  The challenged rule’s redefinition of “sex” under 20 U.S.C. §1681 to include \n“gender identity” and “sexual orientation” is illegal. Courts must interpret a statute’s “words \nconsistent with their ordinary meaning at the time Congress enacted the statute.” Wis. Cent. \nLtd. v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 (2018) (cleaned up). There is no evidence from the time \n57 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 58 of 84\nof Title IX’s enactment—and the Department offers none—to indicate that “sex” referred to \nanything other than biological differences between males and females.  \n166.  As the Department concedes, the en banc Eleventh Circuit held in Adams “that \n‘sex’ as used in Title IX can only refer to ‘biology and reproductive function,’ not gender \nidentity, and that restrooms are covered by a statutory provision permitting a recipient to \nmaintain ‘separate living facilities for the different sexes.’” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820-21 (quoting \nAdams, 57 F.4th at 812-15). Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit evaluated the text, history, purpose, \nand statutory context of Title IX and held that the meaning of “sex” was “clear[ly]” “biological \nsex” and that sex-separated bathroom policies were obviously permissible under Title IX. Ad-\nams, 57 F.4th at 812-15. \n167.  The Department’s only real response is the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock, \nbut that opinion about Title VII does not dictate another result for Title IX, as the Eleventh \nCircuit, along with many other circuits, have held. In Bostock, the Court held that discrimination \n“because of sex” under Title VII prohibited employers from terminating employees because \nof their transgender status. 590 U.S. at 667-69. The Court “agree[d] that homosexuality and \ntransgender status are distinct concepts from sex,” but concluded that firing employees “based \non homosexuality or transgender status” triggers Title VII’s protections because the em-\nployer’s action “necessarily entails” a decision made “in part because of the affected individu-\nals’ sex.” Id. The Court’s decision rested on the premise that sex is binary and immutable, and \nthat an employee’s biological sex is a necessary component of any determination about \nwhether “discrimination because of sex” has occurred under Title VII. Put differently, whether \nan adverse action against a transgender employee violates Title VII under Bostock depends not \n58 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 59 of 84\non the specific nature of the employee’s gender identity but on how the employer treats the \nemployee as compared to other employees of the same biological sex. \n168.  Bostock’s reasoning doesn’t apply here. “The Bostock decision only addressed sex \ndiscrimination under Title VII; the Supreme Court expressly declined to ‘prejudge’ how its \nholding would apply to ‘other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination’ such as \nTitle IX.” Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 833 (E.D. Tenn. 2022) (quoting \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 681). For good reasons: Title IX and Title VII are different laws with \ndifferent statutory language enacted under different congressional authority. And workplace \nenvironments are fundamentally different from educational environments and carry a different \nset of considerations. Title IX was enacted to create educational and athletic opportunities for \nwomen and girls, yet the Department’s understanding of Bostock would do the opposite: elim-\ninate educational opportunities for women and girls, particularly in those areas where biolog-\nical sex is most relevant. Unlike Title VII, moreover, Title IX and its implementing regulations \ncontain several unique carve-outs that reject any importation of Bostock. \n169.  For these reasons, several federal courts, including the Eleventh Circuit, have \nrecognized that “the rule in Bostock extends no further than Title VII.” Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, \nInc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); see, e.g., L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, \n484 (6th Cir. 2023) (Bostock’s “text-driven reasoning applies only to Title VII, as Bostock itself \nand many subsequent cases make clear”); Eknes-Tucker v. Gov’r of Ala., 80 F.4th 1205, 1228-29 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (similar); Bear Creek Bible Church v. EEOC, 571 F. Supp. 3d 571, 621 (N.D. \nTex. 2021) (similar). Most notably, Adams rejected a Title IX challenge to a policy requiring \nstudents to use bathrooms based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity. See \n59 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 60 of 84\n57 F.4th at 811. In reaching that result, the court held that Bostock’s reasoning didn’t apply to \nTitle IX. See id. (“We cannot, as the Supreme Court did in Bostock, decide only whether dis-\ncrimination based on transgender status necessarily equates to discrimination on the basis of \nsex.”). Bostock was distinguishable, the court held, “because Title IX, unlike Title VII, includes \nexpress statutory and regulatory carve-outs for differentiating between the sexes.” Id. The \nEleventh Circuit noted that if Title IX’s reference to “‘sex’ were ambiguous enough to include \n‘gender identity,’” then those “carve-out[s], as well as the various carveouts under the imple-\nmenting regulations, would be rendered meaningless.” Id. at 813. \n170.  Regardless, even if Bostock were relevant for Title IX, the rule’s application of it \nis wrong. Bostock emphasized that to determine whether an act “discriminate[s],” a court must \nuse a comparator—i.e., compare the plaintiff to “others who are similarly situated.” Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 657 (emphasis added). In Bostock, male and female employees were similarly situated \nbecause “[a]n individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment \ndecisions.” Id. at 660. Here, by contrast, a student’s biology is relevant to decisions about \nathletics, bathrooms, and locker rooms. The Department “strongly agrees” that schools “have \na legitimate interest in protecting all students’ safety and privacy.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820. Even \nif Bostock’s reasoning applied, the Department unreasonably explained and applied it here. \n171.  If any doubts remain, two clear-statement rules—under the major-questions \ndoctrine and the Spending Clause—should extinguish them. \n172.  Start with the major-questions doctrine. Even when there’s a “colorable textual \nbasis” about the scope of an agency’s authority, an agency cannot make broad “assertion[s]” \nof authority on issues of “economic and political significance” without clear congressional \n60 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 61 of 84\nauthorization. West Virginia. v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721-22 (2022); see Biden v. Nebraska, 143 \nS.Ct. 2355, 2372-75 (2023); Georgia v. President of the U.S., 46 F.4th 1283, 1295-96 (11th Cir. \n2022). Despite the intense public debate over gender-identity laws in recent years, the chal-\nlenged rule imposes the Department’s own views on the matter—promulgated under formal \nrulemaking for the first time—onto the vast majority of American educational institutions. Cf. \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 721. Congress has repeatedly declined to provide such authorization, \nmost recently in 2013 and 2015. So even if Title IX’s command were ambiguous, the rule \nwould still violate the major-questions doctrine. \n173.  The challenged rule is also contrary to law because it violates the Spending \nClause and its clear-statement requirement. U.S. Const. art. I, §8. “Congress passed Title IX \npursuant to its authority under the Spending Clause.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 815. The Supreme \nCourt has understood the Spending Clause to authorize Congress to “attach conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds.” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206-07 (1987). But this power is \n“not unlimited.” Id. at 207. \n174.  Two limits are relevant here. One, “if Congress desires to condition the States’ \nreceipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously, enabling the States to exercise their \nchoice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.” Id. (cleaned up). In \nother words, “spending restrictions imposed by Congress must be ascertainable to be enforce-\nable.” W.V. ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1143 (11th Cir. 2023). \nTwo, Congress may not use its spending power to “indirectly coerc[e] a State to adopt a federal \nregulatory system as its own.” NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 578 (2012) (op. of Roberts, C.J.). \n61 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 62 of 84\n175.  The challenged rule violates both limitations. The Department violates “the \nSpending Clause’s required clear-statement rule,” Adams, 57 F.4th at 815, because the rule \npurports to impose obligations on the States that Congress did not “‘unambiguously’” enact \nin Title IX, Morrisey, 59 F.4th at 1142. The rule also jeopardizes a significant amount of the \nStates’ education-related federal funding if they refuse or otherwise violate the Department’s \nnew interpretation of Title IX, leaving the States with “no real option but to acquiesce.” NFIB, \n567 U.S. at 582. \n176.  In any event, the Department concedes that §106.31(a)(2), and its asserted ap-\nplication to bathrooms and locker rooms, is illegal. The Department understands §106.31(a)(2) \nto prevent recipients from barring individuals from using the bathroom or locker room that \ndoes not match their biological sex. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,819-21. But the Department equally \nunderstands that the Eleventh Circuit’s holding in Adams forecloses the Department’s rule and \nposition. See, e.g., id. at 33,820-21 (explaining that the Department “does not agree” with the \nEleventh Circuit’s “interpretation of Title IX” and “declines to adopt the Eleventh Circuit’s \nreasoning in Adams”). \n177.  For all these reasons, the rule is contrary to law and in excess of statutory au-\nthority, so it must be set aside—i.e., vacated. 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(C). “The default rule is that \nvacatur is the appropriate remedy.” Data Mktg. P’ship v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 45 F.4th 846, 859 \n(5th Cir. 2022); see, e.g., United Steel v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (“The ordinary practice is to vacate unlawful agency action.”); Black Warrior River-\nkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 781 F.3d 1271, 1290 (11th Cir. 2015) (“vacatur is the \n62 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 63 of 84\nordinary APA remedy” (cleaned up)). No special reason exists to depart from that ordinary \ncourse. \n178.  The rule is also arbitrary and capricious in many respects. “The APA’s arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.” \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). Courts must ensure “the agency has \nacted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant \nissues and reasonably explained the decision.” Id. Agencies must engage in “reasoned deci-\nsionmaking.” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750-52 (2015). They must rest their actions “on \na consideration of the relevant factors” and “important aspect[s] of the problem.” Id. The \nCourt’s “review is ‘not toothless’” but has “serious bite.” Data Mktg., 45 F.4th at 856; see, e.g., \nLouisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 470 (5th Cir. 2024) (same); Abbott v. Biden, 70 \nF.4th 817, 826 (5th Cir. 2023) (same). \n179.  The challenged rule is arbitrary and capricious because it leaves undisturbed the \nregulation on restrooms and justifies its new regulations on the basis that the bathroom regu-\nlation is invalid because it conflicts with the statute. “But in rescinding a prior action, an agency \ncannot simply brand it illegal and move on.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 475. That is precisely what \nthe Department does. \n180.  The Department also failed to reasonably explain how its rule’s application co-\nherently applies to “nonbinary” (or “bisexual” or “questioning”) individuals. Even assuming \nBostock applies to Title IX, nonbinary persons do not satisfy Bostock’s but-for test for deter-\nmining what classes a statute protects. The “but-for test directs us to change one thing at a \ntime and see if the outcome changes,” and “[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for \n63 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 64 of 84\ncause of that decision, that is enough to trigger the law.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656. Imagine a \nstudent whose sex is male but whose gender identity is “nonbinary.” A school with a policy of \nnot allowing nonbinary students to use the bathroom of the opposite sex would not discrimi-\nnate against this individual based on “sex” because “changing the [person’s] sex would [not] \nhave yielded a different choice by the” school. Id. at 659-60. Otherwise, a school with a policy \nof allowing students to use the bathroom in line with their gender identity would also violate \nTitle IX if they did not provide a third bathroom for gender-neutral students. Contra 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,818. And some claimed nonbinary gender identities do not hinge to sex at all. The \nDepartment failed to adequately address the expansiveness, and arbitrariness, of its rule. \n181.  The Department also failed to adequately consider alternatives within the ambit \nof the existing policy. See DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S.Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (“State \nFarm teaches that when an agency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must consider \nthe alternatives that are within the ambit of the existing policy.” (cleaned up)); Texas v. Biden \n(MPP), 20 F.4th 928, 992 (5th Cir. 2021) (“[A]gency action is arbitrary and capricious when it \nconsiders only the binary choice whether to retain or terminate a program, without also ‘con-\nsidering less disruptive alternatives.’”), rev’d on other grounds, 597 U.S. 785 (2022). The Depart-\nment was dead-set on repealing and replacing the Trump rule, instead of considering more \nmoderate amendments that are tailored to its asserted concerns.  \n182.  The Department failed to adequately consider the alternative of single-occu-\npancy bathrooms. The Department does not explain how a policy requiring students to use \nthe bathroom that aligns with their biological sex or a single-occupancy bathroom results in \nmore than de minimis harm to trans-identified students or violates Title IX. The Department \n64 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 65 of 84\neven brushes off an alternative that requires offering single-occupancy bathrooms because \nsuch an option is “not the only way a recipient could provide nondiscriminatory access its \nfacilities” and the alternative “would likely carry significant cost implications,” requiring the \nDepartment “to seek public comment on this issue before making any such changes.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,820. But commenters raised this alternative, and the Department had to address it. \nIt is not a reasonable explanation to say that the alternative might be costly. As the Supreme \nCourt has explained, “‘costs and burdens’ do not excuse the Government from considering \nthe full panoply of alternatives to its chosen action in repealing” an effective policy. Louisiana, \n90 F.4th at 476-77 (quoting Regents, 140 S.Ct. at 1914-15).  \n183.  Nor is it reasonable to say that recipients can “tak[e] nondiscriminatory steps to \nensure privacy and safety for all students in a recipient’s sex-separate facilities.” 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,820. The Department does not explain how this is possible, and it failed to consider that \nit would impose enormous costs and time to actually increase privacy and safety in sex-separate \nfacilities that are used by both sexes. For example, the economic cost of building new bath-\nrooms with adequate privacy protections is extraordinary; practically speaking, individualized \nre-engineering of hundreds of thousands of facilities is not possible. An estimate in Loudoun \nCounty shows that bathroom renovations alone will cost that school district $11 million dollars \nfor two of its eighteen high schools. Minock, Loudoun Schools Explore Replacing Boys and Girls Bath-\nrooms with All-Gender, Single Stalls, ABC7 News (Apr. 12, 2023), perma.cc/CN4W-WU52. This \nfigure excludes the other sixteen high schools, sixty-five elementary schools, and twenty-one \nmiddle schools in that district alone. \n65 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 66 of 84\n184.  The challenged rule is also arbitrary and capricious because it fails to reasonably \nhandle an important aspect of the problem: athletics. The Department tries to avoid the nec-\nessary implications of its position on gender-identity discrimination for women’s sports by \nclaiming that sex-separate athletic teams can continue because the Department has a regulation \nthat expressly allows it. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817-88, 33,839. The Department ignores, however, \nits own position that categorical bans on biological males participating in women’s sports are \ninvalid. See B.P.J., Doc. 42, No. 2:21-cv-316. Plus, the soundness of the Department’s inter-\npretation of discrimination on the basis of sex depends on context and the history of Title IX, \nwhich includes sports. See Adams, 57 F.4th at 816 (concluding that a decision about bathrooms \n“would have broad implications for sex-separated sports teams at institutions subject to Title \nIX, including public schools and public and private universities”). The practicability and wise-\nness of its policy decisions necessarily depends on how its decision in the rule challenged here \naffects athletics. See id. at 821 (Lagoa, J., concurring) (explaining that a bathroom determination \n“would open the door to eroding Title IX’s beneficial legacy for girls and women in sports” \nand that “removing distinctions based on biological sex from sports … harms not only girls’ \nand women’s prospects in sports, but also hinders their development and opportunities be-\nyond the realm of sports”). The Department cannot save for later an important aspect of the \nproblem when the validity of its current rule depends on the answers. The Department’s fail-\nure to address sports in the challenged rule renders it arbitrary and capricious. \n185.  Section 106.31’s use of a “more than de minimis harm” requirement is arbitrary \nand capricious because the Department failed to consider relevant and binding precedent. The \nDepartment relies heavily on Bostock (a Title VII case) but fails to square its interpretation of \n66 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 67 of 84\nTitle IX with another Title VII case from the Supreme Court applying Bostock. Title VII, the \nSupreme Court has explained, does not ask how much harm a discriminatory action imposes. \nMuldrow v. City of St. Louis, 144 S.Ct. 967, 976 (2024). The Court rejected any requirement that \nthe “injury” be “‘significant,’ ‘material,’ or ‘serious.’” Id. at 975 n.2. The Department failed to \nconsider this relevant issue, let alone reasonably explain why this recent interpretation of Title \nVII does not unravel its heavy reliance on the concept of “de minimis harm.” That failure \nrenders the action arbitrary and capricious. \n186.  It also dooms the rest of the rule. The Department contends that the more-\nthan-de-minimis-harm requirement is a “threshold concept” that is “particularly important in \nthe context of determining when separate or different treatment on the basis of sex may be \npermitted, and when it constitutes prohibited discrimination under Title IX.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,815. But the Department’s key “threshold concept” is inadequately justified or explained. \nBecause the justification for the Department’s other discrimination regulations hinge on the \nacceptance of the more-than-de-minimis-harm “concept,” the other regulations are arbitrary \nand capricious as well. \n187.  The rule is also arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed to rea-\nsonably consider parental rights or reasonably explain how the rule interacts with those rights. \nThe challenged rule declares that it trumps parents’ rights, including their right to access their \nchild’s information under FERPA and state laws. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (34 C.F.R. \n§106.6(e)). Commenters pressed concerns that the rule would bar a recipient from “treat[ing] \na student according to their” biological sex “if requested by the parents to do so,” “notify[ing] \na student’s parents of the student’s gender transition or gender identity,” or letting parents \n67 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 68 of 84\naccess “their child’s educational records, including information about their child’s gender iden-\ntity.” Id. at 33,821-22. Rather than deny these concerns, the Department concedes that the rule \ncan require such results, even when state law guarantees these parental rights. See id. at 33,822 \n(“the hypothetical factual scenarios raised by commenters require case-by-case determina-\ntions”); id. (“The Department declines to opine on how §106.31(a)(2) interacts or conflicts \nwith any specific State laws because it would require a fact-specific analysis, but refers the \npublic to §106.6(b), which affirms that a recipient’s obligation to comply with Title IX and the \nregulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law.”). An agency cannot adopt \na radical change and then not directly address the significant consequences of its amendment \nby stating that it is saving the tough judgments for later. “[B]are acknowledgment is no sub-\nstitute for reasoned consideration.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 473. \n188.  None of the Department’s errors are harmless. “In administrative law, the \nharmless error rule is quite narrow.” Wages & White Lion Invs., LLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 389 \n(5th Cir. 2024) (en banc); accord Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623, 628-29 (2023). “[A]n agency \ndecision is harmless only ‘when a mistake of the administrative body is one that clearly had no \nbearing on the procedure used or the substance of the decision reached.’” Bidi Vapor LLC v. \nFDA, 47 F.4th 1191, 1205 (11th Cir. 2022). These legal violations are the substance of the \ndecision. \n189.  Because the Department failed to act reasonably or reasonably explain its deci-\nsions, the challenged rule is arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside. See 5 U.S.C. \n§706(2)(A); see also Data Mktg., 45 F.4th at 859; Black Warrior, 781 F.3d at 1290. No special \nreason exists to depart from that ordinary course. Defendants’ action is contrary to law, in \n68 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 69 of 84\nexcess of Defendants’ statutory and regulatory authority, and arbitrary and capricious. The \nunlawful parts cannot be severed from the rest. There are substantial doubts that the Depart-\nment would have adopted its redefinition of sex and the other parts that cross-reference that \nredefinition on its own. The rule must be vacated. \nCOUNT II \nRedefinition of “Sex-Based Harassment” \n190.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege parts I-II, III.B, and IV.  \n191.  The challenged rule is final agency action under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §704. The \nAPA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capri-\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;” “contrary to constitu-\ntional right, power, privilege, or immunity;” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right.” §706(2). \n192.  The rule, both as a whole and in several particulars, violates the APA. It asserts \npower that exceeds the agency’s lawful authority and rests on reasoning (or a lack thereof) that \nis arbitrary and capricious. \n193.  The challenged rule broadens the definition of sex-based harassment and lowers \nschools’ protections from liability. The 2020 rule defined “‘sexual harassment’” to include \n“[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and ob-\njectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity.” 34 C.F.R. §106.30(a) (emphases added). It also adopted Davis’s and \nGebser’s liability requirements of actual knowledge and deliberate indifference: “[a] recipient \nwith actual knowledge of sexual harassment in an education program or activity of the recipi-\nent against a person in the United States, must respond promptly in a manner that is not \n69 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 70 of 84\ndeliberately indifferent.” §106.44(a); accord Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, \n290-91 (1998); Davis, 526 U.S. at 633.  \n194.  The new definition now reads: \nUnwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is sub-\njectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies \na person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or \nactivity (i.e., creates a hostile environment). Whether a hostile environment has been \ncreated is a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration of the following: \n(i) The degree to which the conduct affected the complainant’s ability to \naccess the recipient’s education program or activity; \n(ii) The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct; \n(iii) The parties’ ages, roles within the recipient’s education program or \nactivity, previous interactions, and other factors about each party that \nmay be relevant to evaluating the effects of the conduct; \n(iv) The location of the conduct and the context in which the conduct \noccurred; and \n(v) Other sex-based harassment in the recipient’s education program or \nactivity. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2). \n195.  It also requires a recipient to “promptly and effectively end any sex discrimina-\ntion,” even if it’s not deliberately indifferent, and wrongly equates sex discrimination with \nsexual harassment. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (34 C.F.R. §106.44(f)(1)). This definition, con-\ncededly and deliberately, exceeds the Supreme Court’s definition of actionable harassment in \nDavis and the deliberate-indifference requirement from Gebser and Davis. The Department has \nno right to define actionable harassment under Title IX differently from the Supreme Court. \n196.  The challenged rule is also illegal because it raises First Amendment concerns \nand, at a minimum, the Department failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking in addressing \nthose concerns. To start, the challenged rule requires educational institutions to define pun-\n70 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 71 of 84\nishable harassment as any “severe or pervasive” act—a formulation that necessarily encom-\npasses single instances of speech, which Davis warned against—that “limits … a person’s ability \nto participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.” Id. The Su-\npreme Court was clear in Davis, however, that punishable “harassment” under Title IX must \nrise to the level of conduct that is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies \nits victims the equal access to education.” 526 U.S. at 652 (emphases added). The rule also \nrequires a recipient to “promptly and effectively end any sex discrimination” even if it’s not \ndeliberately indifferent. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (34 C.F.R. §106.44(f)(1)); contra 526 U.S. at \n650-52. The rule’s new hostile-environment definition thus covers a single or isolated incident \nand all negative effects like “a mere ‘decline in grades,’” a choice to skip class, or a decision \nnot to attend a campus activity. Davis, 526 U.S. at 652-53; accord 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511 (“[A] \ncomplainant must demonstrate some impact on their ability to participate or benefit from the \neducation program or activity, but the definition does not specify any particular limits or de-\nnials.”). And the rule’s new definition would force students and teachers to, for example, use \nsomeone’s “preferred pronouns.” \n197.  These deviations from Davis are not semantic. The Eleventh Circuit has already \nheld that a harassment definition materially similar to the rule’s harassment definition, when \nadopted by a public university, likely violates the First Amendment. Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110. \nCourts have concluded that school policies against students “misgendering” other students \nviolate the First Amendment. E.g., Linn Mar, 83 F.4th at 666-69. The rule’s deviations from \nDavis thus “raise grave constitutional concerns,” which requires holding the rule unlawful. \nMexican Gulf Fishing Co. v. Dep’t of Com., 60 F.4th 956, 966 (5th Cir. 2023); accord Solid Waste \n71 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 72 of 84\nAgency of N. Cook Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 U.S. 159, 172-73 (2001) (constitutional-\ndoubt canon is a traditional tool of interpretation); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast \nBldg. & Const. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (same).  \n198.  Other aspects of the new rule exacerbate the breadth of the rule. The challenged \nrule reaches “conduct that occurs in a building owned or controlled by a student organization,” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (34 C.F.R. §106.11); misconduct occurring off campus (online or oth-\nerwise) or even “outside the United States,” id.; and activities that occurred before any of the \nindividuals attended the school, id. at 33,527. The rule applies to speech uttered at all points \nin a student’s life, even when at home. But the government’s ability to punish speech made \noff school grounds is limited—even in the K-12 context and especially when it comes to “po-\nlitical or religious speech.” See Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B L. ex rel. Levy, 594 U.S. 180, 189-90 \n(2021). This aspect of the rule raises serious constitutional concerns as well. \n199.  The Department’s new definition of retaliation makes matters worse. The rule \nexpands the definition of retaliation to cover “intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimina-\ntion” and expressly covers “peer retaliation.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2); id. at \n33,896 (34 C.F.R. §106.71). The rule also removes the provision clarifying that the exercise of \nFirst Amendment rights is not retaliation. Under this broad definition, it is likely that a student \nwould be subjected to a grievance procedure for criticizing or ostracizing a student for partic-\nipating in the Title IX process. Courts, though, have rejected peer ostracism as a basis for \nfinding retaliation. See Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 929 (9th Cir. 2000). This part \nof the rule exacerbates the rule’s already serious constitutional concerns. \n72 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 73 of 84\n200.  The Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously. It failed to reasonably con-\nsider the constitutional concerns raised by its new sex-based harassment definition, its new \ngeographic scope, and its new retaliation definition individually—let alone taken together. And \nin deciding to deviate from Davis, the Department failed to reasonably address its conflation \nof Title IX with Title VII, applying workplace standards not only to classroom environments \nbut also to students’ personal lives. The Department’s failure to engage in reasoned deci-\nsionmaking is independently fatal. \n201.  Moreover, the Department’s deviation from Davis’s deliberate-indifference re-\nquirement is arbitrary and capricious. Recipients’ risk of liability is exacerbated by the rule’s \nrequirement that schools respond to allegations of sex discrimination promptly and efficiently, \nrather than Davis’s and Gebser’s requirement of deliberate indifference. The 2020 rule adopted \nthe Supreme Court’s deliberate-indifference requirement for liability because “the recipient \ncannot commit its own misconduct unless the recipient first knows of the sexual harassment \nthat needs to be addressed.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,432 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292). The \nDepartment now changes course, asserting that it “is not required to adopt the Gebser/Davis \nstandard” because “the standard for administrative enforcement is not derived from the same \nimplied remedy discussed in Gebser and Davis.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,560. This reasoning is arbi-\ntrary and capricious. The agency has no authority to override the Supreme Court’s interpreta-\ntions of Title IX. Whether a private plaintiff is bringing a lawsuit or the Department is bringing \nan enforcement action, the language of Title IX is the same. As are the concerns that the Court \narticulated in Davis.  \n73 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 74 of 84\n202.  And the Department failed to reasonably consider the catch-22 that its change \ncauses recipients. When the rule conflicts with the one from Davis and Gebser, schools must \nadopt the harsher standard, rendering Davis and Gebser a dead letter. This forced-choice ap-\nproach is particularly problematic because decisions like Davis were a compromise. Justice \nKennedy warned in his dissent for four Justices that “[a] school faced with a peer sexual har-\nassment complaint in the wake of the majority’s decision may well be beset with litigation from \nevery side. One student’s demand for a quick response to her harassment complaint will con-\nflict with the alleged harasser’s demand for due process.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 682 (Kennedy, J., \ndissenting). “On college campuses, and even in secondary schools, a student’s claim that the \nschool should remedy a sexually hostile environment will conflict with the alleged harasser’s \nclaim that his speech, even if offensive, is protected by the First Amendment. In each of these \nsituations, the school faces the risk of suit, and maybe even multiple suits, regardless of its \nresponse.” Id. at 682-83. The majority avoided this problem by stressing the deliberate-indif-\nference requirement to liability and the stringent definition of actionable harassment. By aban-\ndoning the deliberate-indifference requirement, the Department unravels Davis’s reasoning. \nAnd the Department does so without reasonably considering the bind it’s putting recipients \nin. \n203.  The Department’s hostile-environment definition is also internally inconsistent, \nrendering the rule arbitrary and capricious. It stresses a “totality of circumstances” test that \nconsiders, among other things, “[t]he degree to which the conduct affected the complainant’s \nability to access the recipient’s education program or activity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 \nC.F.R. §106.2). But that factor is in tension with the Department’s other statement that “sex-\n74 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 75 of 84\nbased conduct meets the ‘severe or pervasive’ standard of sex-based harassment if it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” Id. at 33,508. The Department reads out “severe or pervasive” from its definition. It \nis not clear why the degree of harm matters if the only requirement is that the harassment \n“limits” the individuals’ ability to participate in education, and the Department provides no \nreasonable explanation justifying this tension.  \n204.  Further, the Department’s action is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to \nreasonably address comments on misgendering. The Department noted that a commenter \nraised the Department’s “recent resolution letter finding that a school district violated Title IX \nwhen it failed to effectively respond to a misgendering of a student.” Id. at 33,516. Other \ncommentators also “urged” the Department to state that “misgendering is a form of sex-based \nharassment that can create a hostile environment.” Id. Many commentators also raised the \nnotice of proposed rulemakings seeming approval of the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, stating \nthat misgendering is punishable harassment. Rather than address these comments or the 2016 \nletter, the Department did not meaningfully engage with either comment or even cite the 2016 \nletter, but merely stated that the issue “is necessarily fact-specific” and that “a stray remark, \nsuch as a misuse of language, would not constitute harassment under this standard.” Id. The \nterse statement is hardly “‘reasoned decisionmaking.’” Michigan, 576 U.S. at 750. Commenta-\ntors put the Department on notice of the 2016 letter and the resolution, so the Department \nwas obligated to address those “relevant authorit[ies]” and explain any “inconsistencies” or \ndifferences in position. Data Mktg., 45 F.4th at 857. \n75 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 76 of 84\n205.  The Department also failed to adequately consider alternatives within the ambit \nof the existing policy. See Regents, 140 S.Ct. at 1913; MPP, 20 F.4th at 992. The Department \nwas dead-set on repealing and replacing the Trump rule’s codification of Davis, instead of \nconsidering more moderate amendments that are tailored to its asserted concerns. \n206.  Because the rule purports to preempt all state-law provisions inconsistent with \nits terms, it will unreasonably and unlawfully force States to walk into liability traps or create \nan unworkable regime. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (34 C.F.R. §106.6(b)) (“The obligation to \ncomply with Title IX and this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or \nother requirement that conflicts with Title IX or this part.”). The Department did not reason-\nably anticipate or address this problem, or choose a solution within its statutory authority. \nCOUNT III \nRemoval of Procedures \n207.  Plaintiffs incorporate and reallege parts I-II, III.C, and IV.  \n208.  The challenged rule is final agency action under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §704. The \nAPA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capri-\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; “contrary to constitu-\ntional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right.” §706(2). \n209.  The rule, both as a whole and in several particulars, violates the APA. It asserts \npower that exceeds the agency’s lawful authority and rests on reasoning (or a lack thereof) that \nis arbitrary and capricious. \n210.  The rule challenged here requires schools to overhaul the procedures they use \nfor Title IX grievances. As with the sexual-harassment definition, these changes force schools \n76 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 77 of 84\nto risk liability and costly lawsuits—creating an unworkable regime that the Department did \nnot adequately consider or justify. They also risk harm to the Private Plaintiffs’ members and \nto the State Plaintiffs’ students, including students who attend private schools and schools in \nother States. \n211.  The rule eliminates the right to a live hearing at postsecondary institutions and \nthe right to cross-examine witnesses, including the accuser. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,895 (34 \nC.F.R. §106.46(g)) (“A postsecondary institution’s sex-based harassment grievance procedures \nmay, but need not, provide for a live hearing … with the parties physically present in the same \ngeographic location.”). Under the 2020 rule, students accused of Title IX misconduct had the \nright to defend themselves in person; now, their colleges or universities have full discretion \nwhether to deny requests for live hearings. Id. Even if schools give the accused some sort of \nhearing, the accused (through an advisor or otherwise) still does not have a right to cross-\nexamine the accuser or witnesses. Courts have found that such procedures raise grave due-\nprocess concerns. See, e.g., Gorman v. Univ. of R.I., 837 F.2d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring \n“something more than an informal interview with an administrative authority of the college”); \nPrasad v. Cornell Univ., 2016 WL 3212079 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 24); Univ. of the Scis., 961 F.3d at 215; \nKhan v. Yale Univ., 347 Conn. 1, 41 (2023); Messeri v. DiStefano, 480 F. Supp. 3d 1157, 1164 (D. \nColo. 2020).  \n212.  In serious cases that turn on witness credibility, courts have held that the Due \nProcess Clause requires live cross-examination. They note that cross-examination is “essential \nto a fair hearing,” Brandeis Univ., 177 F. Supp. 3d at 605, “like no other procedural device” in \nits effectiveness, Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 872 F.3d 393, 401 (6th Cir. 2017), and “the ‘greatest \n77 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 78 of 84\nlegal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth,’” California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 158 \n(1970). Courts stress its importance especially in sexual-misconduct cases, given the “he-said-\nshe-said” nature of the inquiry. See, e.g., Donohue v. Baker, 976 F. Supp. 136, 147 (N.D.N.Y. \n1997) (a university student was entitled to cross-examine accuser in a sexual-assault case be-\ncause the case turned on the accuser’s credibility). Per the Sixth Circuit, “[c]ross-examination \nis essential in cases like [these] because it … ‘takes aim at credibility like no other procedural \ndevice.’ Without the back-and-forth of adversarial questioning, the accused cannot probe the \nwitness’s story to test her memory, intelligence, or potential ulterior motives.” Doe v. Baum, \n903 F.3d 575, 582 (6th Cir. 2018) (cleaned up); see Univ. of Cincinnati, 872 F.3d at 402 (“Cross-\nexamination is … ‘essential to due process’ in a case that turns on credibility.”). The elimina-\ntion of a parties’ right to a live hearing with cross-examination, even when credibility is a key \nissue, is arbitrary and capricious. \n213.  The  challenged  rule  states  that  college  students  accused  of  misconduct—\ncharges that could ruin their academic and professional careers if they are found guilty—no \nlonger have a right to be accompanied by counsel at all proceedings. Instead, the rule allows \npostsecondary schools to limit their attendance as long as the restriction applies equally to all \nparties. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,894 (34 C.F.R. §106.46(e)(2)); id. at 33,720. The only requirement \nis that the Title IX coordinator prevent the accuser from being represented by counsel at those \nsame proceedings. Id. But it’s the accused, rather than the accuser, whose need for counsel is \nparticularly acute. The rule’s elimination of the right to adequate participation by a representa-\ntive raises due-process and sex-discrimination concerns. The Department has not reasonably \nconsidered these concerns. \n78 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 79 of 84\n214.  The challenged rule limits the opportunity for parties to present witnesses. Par-\nties can present “fact witnesses” that are “relevant and not otherwise impermissible” but no \nlonger expert witnesses. See id. at 33,892 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(f)(2)); id. at 33,594. And the Title \nIX coordinator gets to determine whether the fact witness is “relevant.” Courts have already \nidentified due-process concerns with this regime. See, e.g., Brandeis Univ., 177 F. Supp. 3d at 606 \n(allowing a due-process claim to continue because the accused supplied “additional facts, \nnames of additional witness, and his sworn affidavit” but the dean “refused to refer any of \nJohn’s additional facts, witnesses, or affidavit to the Special Examiner for further considera-\ntion”). \n215.  The rule removes the right of students to inspect all the evidence against them. \nThe rule instead allows the parties to access a mere “description” of the “relevant and not \notherwise impermissible evidence” unless the parties go out of their ways to request an “equal \nopportunity to access the evidence.” Compare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,892 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(f)); and \nid. at 33,894 (34 C.F.R. §106.46(e)), with 34 C.F.R. §106.45(b)(5)(vi) (“Provide both parties an \nequal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that \nis directly related to the allegations raised in a formal complaint.” (emphases added)).  \n216.  Although the accused is provided a “[n]otice of allegations,” only the rare stu-\ndent who is particularly well-versed in Title IX procedures would know about this separate \nright. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,891-93 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(c), §106.46(c)). And the parties have no \nway of knowing what evidence was not included in the report because the recipient determined \nthat the evidence was irrelevant or impermissible. The limited access is especially detrimental \nbecause under the challenged rule, the decisionmaker and the Title IX coordinator can be the \n79 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 80 of 84\nsame person, so the decisionmaker could potentially know and base his decision on infor-\nmation related to the complaint that the parties have not had a fair opportunity to contextual-\nize or challenge. This limited access to the evidence raises more due-process concerns. See, e.g., \nPurdue Univ., 928 F.3d at 663; Averett v. Hardy, 2020 WL 1033543, *5-8 (W.D. Ky. Mar. 3).  \n217.  The Department did not reasonably explain why providing to the accused the \nevidence without a request, along with a description, is impractical or unwise. Nor did the \nDepartment reasonably explain why the broader scope of evidence inspectable under the 2020 \nrule is inadequate. Nor did the Department reasonably address the due-process concerns \nraised by its new regime. \n218.  The rule also limits schools’ discretion to use a higher burden of proof. Under \nthe 2020 rule, schools could adopt the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard or the clear-\nand-convincing-evidence standard as long as the standard was the same for complaints against \nstudents and employees. 85 Fed. Reg. 30,575. The challenged rule now lets recipients use a \nhigher burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence) only if they use that higher burden “in \nall other comparable proceedings, including proceedings relating to other discrimination com-\nplaints.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(h)(1)). The Department many times claims \nthat its many changes are to give recipients increased “flexibility.” But the Department does \nnot reasonably explain its justification for constraining recipients’ discretion on the burden of \nproof. \n219.  The challenged rule permits schools to use a single-investigator model. The De-\npartment will no longer require a separate Title IX coordinator and investigator and deci-\nsionmaker. Id. at 33,891 (34 C.F.R. §106.45(b)(2)). Instead, these roles can all fall under the \n80 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 81 of 84\numbrella of a single school employee. The same individual can hear the original allegations, \ndecide whether to investigate, do the investigation, evaluate the evidence, and make a final \ndecision. This rule threatens to inject bias into the proceedings and raises more due-process \nconcerns.  \n220.  Courts have cautioned against the legality of proceedings where one person \nserves as the investigator, factfinder, and ultimate decisionmaker. See, e.g., Brandeis Univ., 177 \nF. Supp. 3d at 606 (“The dangers of combining in a single individual the power to investigate, \nprosecute, and convict, with little effective power of review, are obvious.”); Univ. of Scis., 961 \nF.3d at 216 (finding that “at least as it has been implemented here, the single-investigator \nmodel violated the fairness” owed to students accused of sexual misconduct); Doe v. Grinnell \nColl., 473 F. Supp. 3d 909, 924 (S.D. Iowa 2019) (suggesting that the single-investigator model \ncan even color the appeal process); Doe v. Claremont McKenna Coll., 25 Cal. App. 5th 1055, 1072-\n73 (2018) (all decisionmakers “must make credibility determinations, and not simply approve \nthe credibility determinations of the one Committee member who was also the investigator”); \nDoe v. Miami Univ., 882 F.3d 579, 601, 605 (6th Cir. 2018) (court found “legitimate concerns” \nraised by the investigator’s “alleged dominance on the three-person [decisionmaking] panel” \nbecause “she was the only one of the three with conflicting roles”). The 2020 rule separated \nthese roles as an important prophylactic measure; and the challenged rule does not adequately \nconsider the significant due-process concerns of a single-investigator model, let alone how its \ninterests militate the grave dangers of allowing a single person investigate, prosecute, and con-\nvict. \n81 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-GMB   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 82 of 84\n221.  The challenged rule allows an investigation to begin without any formal written \ncomplaint. The accused need only receive an “oral” statement that a person would “objec-\ntively” understand as a “request” to “investigate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,882 (34 C.F.R. §106.2). \nBut verbal complaints are often vague and imprecise, making it difficult, if not impossible, to \nprovide accurate and adequate written notice. Perhaps worse, the rule now permits the Title \nIX coordinator to initiate a grievance procedure even in “the absence of a complaint or the \nwithdrawal of any or all of the allegations in a complaint.” Id. at 33,889 (§106.44(f)(1)(v)). The \nrule empowers Title IX coordinators to go beyond their mandatory reporting duties and, in \ntheir discretion, police activities on campus that they determine constitute sex discrimination. \nGiven the overall breadth of “sex discrimination” and “sex-based harassment” under the rule, \nthis provision likely gives Title IX coordinators and other employees the power to open in-\nvestigations and start proceedings based solely on what they have heard. \n222.  The rule’s changes separately and collectively raise grave concerns, opening re-\ncipients up to lawsuits raising due-process claims. They also set up a regime that could itself \ndiscriminate based on sex, opening recipients up to lawsuits raising sex-discrimination claims. \nSee, e.g., Univ. of Scis., 961 F.3d at 209-10 (agreeing with a plaintiff who alleged the university \n“limited procedural protections afforded to male students like [the plaintiff] in sexual miscon-\nduct cases”); Baum, 903 F.3d at 586 (similar); Doe v. Univ. of Denver, 1 F.4th 822, 835-36 (10th \nCir. 2021) (similar).  \n223.  These grave concerns render the rule illegal. See, e.g., Solid Waste Agency, 531 U.S. \nat 172-73; Edward, 485 U.S. at 574-75; Mexican Gulf Fishing, 60 F.4th at 966.

The United States Department of Education is required to enact \nregulations consistent with Title IX’s statutory directive. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. In April \n2024, the Department adopted new regulations entitled Nondiscrimination on the \nBasis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or Activities  Receiving  Federal  Financial \nAssistance (“the Final Rule”). Plaintiffs filed suit, contending the Final Rule should \nbe  vacated  in  its  entirety  because  it  violates  the Administrative  Procedure Act \n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nPlaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking a stay of the Final \nRule’s effective date or, in the alternative, preliminarily enjoining the Department \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 2 of 122\nfrom enforcing the Final Rule in their States.

INTRODUCTION \n  Plaintiffs are the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina \n(“the States”), and the Independent Women’s Law Center, Independent Women’s \nNetwork,  Parents  Defending  Education,  and  Speech  First,  Inc.  (“the  Private \nPlaintiffs”). (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 1–8). They seek a declaration that the Final Rule violates the \nAPA, vacatur of the Final Rule, and a permanent injunction barring enforcement of \nthe rule in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. (Id. at 83). \nDefendants are Miguel Cardona, sued in his official capacity as the Secretary \nof Education, and the U.S. Department of Education. (Id. ¶¶ 9–10). The Department \nof Education is the federal agency that enforces Title IX and effectuates it by “issuing \nrules,  regulations,  or  orders  of  general  applicability  .  .  .  consistent  with  the \nachievement of the objectives of the statute.” (Id. ¶ 10); see 20 U.S.C. § 1682. This \nopinion addresses all Defendants collectively as “the Department.” \n  Plaintiffs’  complaint  is  similar  to  nine  other  cases  filed  throughout  the \ncountry.1 More than half the States in this nation are plaintiffs in Title IX litigation: \nAlabama,  Alaska,  Arkansas,  Florida,  Georgia,  Idaho,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas, \n \n1 Arkansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., no. 24-636 (E.D. Mo.); Carroll Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Dep’t \nof Educ., no. 24-461 (N.D. Tex.); Kansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., no. 24-4041 (D. Kan.); Louisiana \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., no. 24-563 (W.D. La.); Rapides Parish Sch. Bd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., no. \n24-567 (W.D. La.) (consolidated with Louisiana, no. 24-563); Oklahoma State Dep’t of Educ. v. \nUnited States, no. 24-459 (W.D. Okla.); Oklahoma v. Cardona, no. 24-461 (W.D. Okla.); Tennessee \nv. Cardona, no. 24-72 (E.D. Ky.); Texas v. Cardona, no. 24-86 (N.D. Tex.). \n5 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 6 of 122\nKentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,  Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, \nOhio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, \nWest Virginia, and Wyoming. And fifteen States and the District of Columbia filed \nan amicus brief before this court supporting the Department. (Doc. 32).2  \n  Across the ten lawsuits, seven States filed suit in district courts outside their \nhome circuit court of appeals. Alaska, Idaho, and Montana lie within the Ninth \nCircuit but joined lawsuits filed in district courts within the Fifth and Tenth Circuits; \nSouth Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia lie within the Fourth Circuit but joined \nlawsuits filed in district courts within the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits; and Indiana, \na State within the Seventh Circuit, joined a lawsuit filed in a district court within the \nSixth Circuit. (See doc. 1) (South Carolina); Louisiana, no. 24-563, doc. 1 (W.D. \nLa.)  (Montana  and  Idaho);  Kansas,  no.  24-4041,  doc.  1  (D.  Kan.)  (Alaska); \nTennessee, no. 24-72, doc. 1 (E.D. Ky.) (Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia); see \nalso Geographic Boundaries of the U.S. Courts of Appeals and U.S. Dist. Courts, \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/u.s._federal_courts_circuit_map_1.pdf \n[https://perma.cc/NVK4-K3R3].  Notably,  the  States  that  filed  outside  of  their \ndesignated circuits are States whose designated circuit has issued binding precedent \ncontrary to the positions they take here. See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 \n \n2  Those  States  are  California,  Colorado,  Delaware,  Hawaii,  Illinois,  Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and \nWashington. (Doc. 32 at 28–30). \n6 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 7 of 122\nF.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020); Grabowski v. Arizona Bd. of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110 (9th \nCir. 2023); Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of \nEduc., 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by \nIll. Republican Party v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760, 762 (7th Cir. 2020); A.C. ex rel. M.C. \nv. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760 (7th Cir. 2023). South Carolina, a \nplaintiff here, neither mentions nor addresses its binding Fourth Circuit precedent.  \nIn all but one case, plaintiffs seek preliminary relief staying or enjoining the \nrule before its August 1st effective date. Arkansas, no. 24-636, doc. 9; Carroll Indep. \nSch. Dist., no. 24-461, doc. 15; Kansas, no. 24-4041, doc. 24; Louisiana, no. 24-563, \ndoc. 17; Oklahoma, no. 24-461, doc. 21; Tennessee, no. 24-72, docs. 19, 63; Texas, \nno. 24-86, doc. 16; see Oklahoma State Dep’t of Educ., no. 24-459 (no action taken \nsince  filing  of  complaint). This  case  is  no  exception:  shortly  after  filing  their \ncomplaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking a stay of the \nFinal  Rule’s  effective  date  or,  in  the  alternative,  preliminarily  enjoining  the \nDepartment of Education from enforcing the Final Rule in their States. (Doc. 7).  \nAfter the case was reassigned to the undersigned (docs. 16, 17), the court \nattempted to expedite this case (compare doc. 13, with doc. 18). But at Plaintiffs’ \nrequest, and upon the representation that the parties intended to rest on their briefs, \nthe court delayed a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion until July 1, 2024. (See doc. 20; \ndoc. 52 at 3–4). During the hearing, the court provided both parties an opportunity \n7 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 8 of 122\nto call witnesses or otherwise present evidence and Plaintiffs reiterated that they \nintended to rest on the written submissions. (Doc. 52 at 3–4). In short, Plaintiffs were \ngiven many opportunities to develop a fulsome record and declined to do so.  \n“Preliminary  injunction  motions  are  often,  by  necessity,  litigated  on  an \nundeveloped record. But an undeveloped record . . . makes it harder for a plaintiff to \nmeet his burden of proof . . . .” Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1175 (11th Cir. \n2000) (en banc). This case is a clear example of such problems. The evidentiary \nrecord is sparse, and the legal arguments are conclusory and underdeveloped.   \nThe court therefore must ultimately conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to \n“clearly” establish that they are entitled to the “extraordinary and drastic remedy” \nthat is a preliminary injunction. Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 252 F.3d \n1165,  1166  (11th  Cir.  2001). The  court  highlights  that  at  later  stages  in  these \nproceedings, more carefully developed legal arguments and the benefit of a fuller \nevidentiary record might yield a different result. But the court declines to exercise \nits discretion to grant the extraordinary relief Plaintiffs have requested. Accordingly, \nthe court DENIES their motion for a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 7).  \nII.  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n1.  Title IX and its Enforcement \n  Title IX requires that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n8 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 9 of 122\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Through an appropriation from Congress, the \nDepartment provides recipients with federal funds. See 20 U.S.C. § 1682. A recipient \nis defined as:  \nany State or political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of a \nState or political subdivision thereof, any public or private agency, \ninstitution, or organization, or other entity, or any person, to whom \nFederal financial assistance is extended directly or through another \nrecipient and which operates an education program or activity which \nreceives such assistance, including any subunit successor, assignee, or \ntransferee thereof. \n34 C.F.R. § 106.2(i). For simplicity, the court will frequently refer to recipients as \n“schools” or “institutions” throughout this opinion.  \nSection 1682 of Title IX grants the Department the authority to enforce the \nstatute and its regulations by terminating or refusing to grant federal funds to a \nschool that fails to comply. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. And schools may also be held liable \nthrough private lawsuits. Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640 \n(1999) (recognizing an implied private right of action against schools under Title \nIX).  \n2.  Title IX’s Regulations \n  Title IX also authorizes the Department to “issu[e] rules, regulations, or orders \nof general applicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives \nof the statute.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. Those regulations must comply with the APA, \n9 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 10 of 122\nwhich has substantive and procedural requirements. 5 U.S.C. § 706. Substantively, \nthe APA requires that a reviewing court “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” Id. § 706(2)(A). As is relevant here, procedural compliance \nwith the APA requires the agency to provide notice of the proposed rulemaking and \nan opportunity for the public to submit comments on the proposed rule. Id. § 553(b)–\n(c). The agency must consider the submitted comments and provide “a concise \ngeneral statement of [the rule’s] basis and purpose.” Id. § 553(c).  \n  Before any rule can take effect, the agency must submit the rule to Congress \nfor its review. 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A). Congress may pass a joint resolution of \ndisapproval,  which  stops  the  rule  from  taking  effect.  See  id.  § 801(b)(1).  The \nPresident may veto the joint resolution, which Congress may override. See U.S. \nConst. art. I, sec. 7, cl. 3. If Congress does not enact a joint resolution of disapproval, \nthe court is barred from inferring “any intent of the Congress from any action or \ninaction of the Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint resolution \nof disapproval.” 5 U.S.C. § 801(g).  \n  After Title IX’s enactment, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare3 \nadopted  implementing  regulations  for  Title  IX.  Two  of  these  implementing \n \n3 When Title IX was enacted in 1972, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \nwas responsible for enforcing Title IX. Iron Arrow Honor Soc’y v. Heckler, 702 F.2d 549, 551 n.1 \n(5th Cir. 1983), vacated on unrelated grounds by Iron Arrow Honor Soc’y v. Heckler, 464 U.S. 67 \n10 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 11 of 122\nregulations permit separation based on biological sex in restrooms, locker rooms, \nand showers (now codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.33) as well as sports (now codified at \n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)). See Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 \nF.4th 791, 816–7 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc); Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex \nin  Education  Programs  and  Activities  Receiving  or  Benefiting  from  Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 40 Fed. Reg. 24,137, 24,141 (June 4, 1974) (restrooms, locker \nrooms, showers); id. at 24,142–43 (athletics). Since the agency began implementing \nTitle  IX  regulations,  it  has  added  or  amended  regulations.  See,  e.g., \nNondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or  Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026, 30,572–579 (May 19, \n2020) (“the 2020 Rule”). But neither §§ 106.33 nor 106.41 has ever been amended \nor removed, including in the Final Rule.  \n3.  The Adoption of the Final Rule \n  As required by the APA, the Department of Education published a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to amend the Title IX regulations at issue in this case in July \n2022. Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (proposed July 12, \n2022). During this process, the Department received over 240,000 comments from \n \n(1983). That responsibility was transferred to Department of Education in 1979. See Department \nof Education Organization Act, Pub. L. 96-88, § 201, 93 Stat. 668; see Iron Arrow Honor Soc’y, \n702 F.3d at 551 n.1. \n11 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 12 of 122\nthe public. Final Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474, 33,477 (Apr. 29, 2024).  Plaintiffs \nmaintain the vast majority of the comments were negative but do not provide any \nsupport for this claim. (Doc. 1 ¶ 60; doc. 7-1 at 13, 27); but cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,477, \n33,737, 33,840.  \n  After responding to the comments, the Department implemented the Final \nRule, which adds one new regulation and amends, revises, moves, or removes \ntwenty-five  existing regulations.  See  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,882–96. Among  other \nchanges, the Department (1) added 34 C.F.R. § 106.10 to define the scope of sex-\nbased discrimination to include “gender identity”; (2) amended the definition of sex-\nbased harassment in 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 to prohibit harassment that is subjectively and \nobjectively offensive and is severe or pervasive and limits or denies equal access to \nan educational program, and amended 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(f)(1) to require a Title IX \ncoordinator to “promptly and effectively end any sex discrimination” of which it has \nnotice; and (3) changed certain procedures in 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.44, 106.45, 106.46, \nthat a school uses in adjudicating accusations of student misconduct under Title IX.4 \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,882–96; (see doc. 1 ¶¶ 62, 74, 79).  \n \n4 Section 106.10 is not currently codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, but it will be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,474, 33,886. For ease of reference, the court \nwill refer to this regulation as § 106.10 in text, although the court’s citations will be to its location \nin the Federal Register. \nSections 106.2, 106.44, 106.45, and 106.46 are currently codified in the Code of Federal \nRegulations but the Final Rule amends them. For ease of reference, the court will refer to the \ncurrent version of the regulations by where they are codified and will refer to the amended \n12 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 13 of 122\n  The Department issued the Final Rule in April 2024. Absent a successful \ncongressional joint resolution of disapproval, the rule will be effective on August 1, \n2024. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,474; see 5 U.S.C. § 801(b)(1). \nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n1.  The Complaint and the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n  The day the Department issued the Final Rule, Plaintiffs filed their complaint. \n(Doc. 1). On May 8, 2024, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, asking this \ncourt to either stay the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705 or to \npreliminarily enjoin the Department from enforcing the Final Rule in Alabama, \nGeorgia, Florida, and South Carolina. (Doc. 7 at 57–58).  \n  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction  does  not  contend  all  the \namended regulations violate the APA. (See generally doc. 7-1). They challenge only: \n(1) the “redefinition” of “sex” and its effect on the other Title IX regulations, (2) the \n“redefinition” of “sex-based harassment,” and (3) the procedures afforded students \naccused of misconduct under Title IX. (Doc. 7-1 at 14–19). Although they are \nchallenging only some of the amended regulations, Plaintiffs reference “the rule” \nthroughout their brief and during oral argument. (See generally doc. 7-1; doc. 52 at \n14–36). \n \nregulations as “amended § 106.2,” “amended § 106.44(f)(1),” and so on. The court will cite the \ncurrent version of these rules based on each rule’s location in the Code of Federal Regulations and \nwill cite the amended version of each rule based on its location in the Federal Register. \n13 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 14 of 122\n“The rule” is not a defined term and Plaintiffs use it to mean different things \nat different times. On occasion, “the rule” means the whole Final Rule, which \namends, adds, or removes a total of twenty-six individual regulations, and includes \nthe  Department’s  recitation  of  commenter’s  comments  and  the  Department’s \nresponses. (See, e.g., doc. 7-1 at 11 (“[T]he Department’s new rule turns Title IX on \nits head . . . . the Department knew its major provisions couldn’t be enforced . . . . \nThe rule becomes effective on August 1, 2024.”) (emphasis omitted); see also id. at \n13 (identifying the effective date of the “final rule” as August 1, 2024); id. at 20 \n(“The Department’s new rule violates the APA.”)). On other occasions, Plaintiffs \nidentify individual regulations as “the rule.” (See, e.g., doc. 7-1 at 14 (§ 106.10); doc \n7-1 at 15 (amended § 106.2); doc. 7-1 at 16 (amended § 106.44); doc. 7-1 at 17 \n(amended § 106.46)). There is no explanation or argument as to why the Final Rule \nshould be considered collectively in some places and individually in others. The \napproach is unfortunate: it serves no appropriate purpose and intentionally burdens \nthe court, which must attempt to discern the arguments and evaluate whether the \nextraordinary relief sought is warranted “without the luxury of abundant time for \nreflection.” Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc’ns, Inc., 304 F.3d 1167, \n1171 (11th Cir. 2002).  \nAlso, Plaintiffs cite their complaint only four times. (Doc. 7-1 at 12–13, 16 \n(citing doc. 1 ¶¶ 18, 31, 49, 76)). Of course, “injunctive relief must relate in some \n14 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 15 of 122\nfashion to the relief requested in the complaint.” Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 424 F.3d 1117, 1134 (11th Cir. 2005). So “[t]o secure preliminary injunctive \nrelief, . . . [Plaintiffs] must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of prevailing on at \nleast one of the causes of action [they have] asserted” Id. And because the court \nserves only the role of neutral arbiter of the matters presented, United States v. \nSineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375 (2020), it may not concoct arguments where \nPlaintiffs have fallen short. Maradiaga v. United States, 679 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th \nCir. 2012) (quoting Fils v. City of Aventura, 647 F.3d 1272, 1284 (11th Cir. 2011)). \nConsequently, the court presents the subject of Plaintiffs’ arguments as they have \nmade them in their briefs without attempting to marry either the subject or substance \nto any claim for relief in the complaint.  \nFinally, many arguments in Plaintiffs’ motion are inadequately briefed. To \nadequately brief an argument, a party must cite authority, refer to the facts of the \nparty’s case, and provide a “meaningful explanation” for how the legal authority \n“appl[ies] to [the party’s] claim.” Harner v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm’r, 38 F.4th 892, \n899 (11th Cir. 2022). Plaintiffs often fail to meet this standard. (See, e.g., doc. 7-1 at \n21 (stating without analysis that “Title IX clearly does not cover discrimination \nbased  on  ‘gender  identity’”);  id.  at  27  (arguing  without  explanation  that  sex-\nseparated facilities and athletics are “plainly” fundamental issues); id. at 28 (failing \nto cite § 106.31(a)(2) in arguing that the effect on bathrooms makes the Final Rule \n15 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 16 of 122\narbitrary or capricious); id. at 29 (failing to provide any authority for why passing a \nregulation abrogating an earlier regulation requires the Department to address all \nother regulations passed at the same time); doc. 7-1 at 35 (failing to explain what the \nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) requires that the \nFinal Rule would not permit); id. at 46–52 (referencing “due process concerns” \nwithout  actually  making  an  argument  that  the  amended  regulations  are \nunconstitutional); id. at 52 (failing to explain how an amended regulation requiring \na Title IX coordinator to start a grievance procedure without a complaint is different \nfrom the current regulation, which also appears to require the same); id. at 55 (saying \nthe Final Rule conflicts with state statutes and policies without any explanation of \nhow any of the statutes conflict with the Final Rule)). With each failure to provide a \nmeaningful explanation, Plaintiffs forfeit the argument. United States v. Campbell, \n26 F.4th 860, 873 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc); see also, United States v. Esformes, 60 \nF.4th 621, 635 (11th Cir. 2023); Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., 739 F.3d \n678, 681 (11th Cir. 2014); Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown & Root Servs., Inc., 572 \nF.3d 1271, 1283 (11th Cir. 2009). \nWith  those  caveats  in  mind, the  court will summarize  each of  Plaintiffs \narguments below. \n16 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 17 of 122\na.  Redefinition of Sex \n  There is no regulation that defines the word “sex,” see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884; \n(doc.  1  ¶ 63),  and  the  regulations  have never  before defined  the  scope  of  sex \ndiscrimination, see 34 C.F.R. § 106.2. The amended regulations add § 106.10, which \nstates: “Discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of \nsex  stereotypes,  sex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual \norientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.10).  \n  Plaintiffs contend that § 106.10’s “redefinition of ‘sex’ to include ‘gender \nidentity’ is illegal” because the Eleventh Circuit foreclosed that analysis in Adams. \n(Doc.  7-1  at  20–21).  They  also  insist  that  sex  discrimination  means  only \ndiscrimination based on biological sex because Adams held that the United States \nSupreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020) applies \nonly to Title VII and Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205 (11th Cir. \n2023) reaffirms that holding. (Doc. 7-1 at 21). They further contend that § 106.10 is \ncontrary to the law because it violates the major questions doctrine (id. at 26–27) \nand the Spending Clause’s clear statement requirement (id. at 24–26). And they \nassert  the  Department’s  addition  of  § 106.10  was  arbitrary  and  capricious  for \nmultiple reasons. (Id. at 28–36).  \n17 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 18 of 122\nb.  Redefinition  of  Sex-Based  Harassment  and  Recipient \nObligations \n  The  current  regulation,  adopted  in  2020,  defines  “sexual  harassment”  in \nrelevant part as “[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so \nsevere, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal \naccess to the . . . education program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a)(2). This \ndefinition  is  the  standard  the  Supreme  Court  employed  in  Davis  to  determine \nwhether Title IX created a private cause of action against a school for its deliberate \nindifference to known acts of student-on-student harassment. 526 U.S. at 643. \nThe Final Rule, on the other hand, defines “sex-based” “hostile environment \nharassment” in relevant part as “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so \nsevere or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit from the . . . education program or activity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2) (emphasis added). And amended § 106.44(f)(1) adds \nthis language: “[a] recipient must require its Title IX Coordinator, when notified of \nconduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX or this part, \nto take [specified] actions to promptly and effectively end any sex discrimination in \nits education program or activity, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,889 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(f)(1)). \n18 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 19 of 122\n  Plaintiffs contend those changes to amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are \ncontrary to the law because they impose a harassment standard broader than the one \nthe Supreme Court articulated in Davis. (Doc. 7-1 at 36–39). They further argue the \nrule is contrary to the law because the harassment standard’s breadth likely violates \nthe  First Amendment.  (Id.  at  43–45).  Finally,  they  assert  the  Department  was \narbitrary or capricious because, among other reasons, it failed to engage in reasoned \ndecisionmaking. (Id. at 40–43, 45–46). \nc.  Procedural Requirements  \n  The  Final  Rule  allows  institutions to remove  certain  procedures  that the \ncurrent regulations require for misconduct complaints. Some of those permissive \nchanges include: (1) removal of live hearings for sex-based harassment grievance \nprocedures at postsecondary institutions, compare 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(6)(i), with \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,895 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(g); and (2) permitting \nschools to use a single-investigator model in which the decisionmaker of a grievance \ncomplaint may also be the Title IX coordinator or investigator, compare 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.45(b)(7)(i),  with  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,891  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.45(b)(2). \n  But the Final Rule does amend the regulations in two ways that would require \nschools to change their policies in the event their current policies conflict with the \namended regulations. First, the current regulations allow schools to use either a \n19 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 20 of 122\npreponderance of the evidence standard or a clear and convincing evidence standard \nfor all complaints of sexual harassment. 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(1)(vii). Amended \n§ 106.45 requires a school to use a preponderance of the evidence standard for sex \ndiscrimination cases, unless the school uses a clear and convincing standard in “all \nother comparable proceedings,” in which case the school may use a clear and \nconvincing standard in sex discrimination cases. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)). Second, the current regulations require schools \nto initiate grievance procedures upon receipt of a “formal complaint,” defined as “a \ndocument filed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator.” 34 C.F.R. \n§§ 106.45(b)(2)(i), 106.30. Amended § 106.2 now defines “complaint” to include an \noral complaint as well as a written one. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,882 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.2). \n  Plaintiffs contend the changes to the grievance procedures are arbitrary or \ncapricious because the Department failed to adequately explain the reduction in \nprotections of the accused, implicating due process. (Doc. 7-1 at 46–55).  \n2.  The Oral Argument \n  On July 1, 2024, the court held oral argument on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction. (Doc. 52). At the hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel confirmed that \nthey are primarily resting on the briefs (see id. at 3–4) and the argument was \nconsistent with that representation. No party presented live witnesses or evidentiary \n20 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 21 of 122\nmaterial beyond what Plaintiffs attached to their motion for a preliminary injunction. \n(See generally id.). \nIV.   STANDARD OF REVIEW \n  “[A] preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of \nright.’” Benisek v. Lamone, 585 U.S. 155, 158 (2018) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef.  Council,  Inc.,  555  U.S.  7,  24  (2008));  see  also  Siegel,  234  F.3d  at  1176 \n(reiterating that a movant must “clearly establish” entitlement to relief). Indeed, \n“[t]he denial of a preliminary injunction rests within the sound discretion of the \ndistrict court.” L.E. ex rel. Cavorley v. Super. of Cobb Cnty. Sch. Dist., 55 F.4th 1296, \n1299 (11th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks omitted).  \nThe movant bears the burden of showing “(1) substantial likelihood of success \non the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; \n(3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed \ninjunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not \nbe adverse to the public interest.” Callahan v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n939 F.3d 1251, 1257 (11th Cir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted). “Likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits is generally the most important of the four factors.” Speech \nFirst, Inc. v. Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110, 1124 (11th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks \nomitted); see Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. __, 144 S. Ct. 2040, 2052–53 (2024) (“When \nStates and other parties seek to stay the enforcement of a federal regulation against \n21 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 22 of 122\nthem,  often  the  harms  and  equities  will  be  very  weighty  on  both  sides”  and \n“resolution . . .  ultimately turns on the merits . . . .”) (quotation marks omitted; \nalteration accepted). “[T]he burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the \nburdens at trial.” Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 \nU.S. 418, 429 (2006).  \nV.   DISCUSSION  \n  Plaintiffs argue the Final Rule violates the APA because some of the amended \nregulations are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to the law, and in excess of statutory \nauthority.  (Doc.  7-1  at  20);  see  5  U.S.C.  § 706(2)(A),  (C).  The  Department \nchallenges the merits of Plaintiffs’ arguments and also Plaintiffs’ standing to bring \ntheir challenge to the procedural requirements. (Doc. 24).  \n“The standing doctrine stems directly from Article III’s ‘case or controversy’ \nrequirement and implicates [the court’s] subject matter jurisdiction.” Kennedy v. \nFloridian Hotel, Inc., 998 F.3d 1221, 1229 (11th Cir. 2021) (some quotation marks \nomitted). And  “[c]ourts  have  an  independent  obligation  to  determine  whether \nsubject-matter jurisdiction exists, even when no party challenges it.” Hertz Corp. v. \nFriend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). So the court’s analysis begins with whether Plaintiffs \nhave  standing  to  assert  any  of  their  claims.  Because  the  court  concludes  that \nPlaintiffs have standing for all of their claims, the court’s analysis proceeds.  \n22 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 23 of 122\n1.  Standing \nStanding  is  determined  “as  of  the  time  at  which”  Plaintiffs  filed  their \ncomplaint, Focus on the Fam. v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., 344 F.3d 1263, \n1275 (11th Cir. 2003), and is “an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case,” Lujan v. \nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). A plaintiff must “have suffered an injury \nin fact, that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and that is \nlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” Glynn Env’t Coal., Inc. v. \nSea Island Acquisition, LLC, 26 F.4th 1235, 1240 (11th Cir. 2022) (quotation marks \nomitted; alterations accepted). “[E]ach element must be supported in the same way \nas any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the \nmanner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.” \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nBecause Plaintiffs are before this court seeking a preliminary injunction, they \n“must make a ‘clear showing’ that [they are] ‘likely’ to establish each element of \nstanding.” Murthy v. Missouri, 144 S. Ct. 1972, 1986 (2024) (quoting Winter, 555 \nU.S. at 22). Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction does not involve any \nfactual disputes; it involves only questions of law. (See generally doc. 7-1). As a \nresult, Plaintiffs carry their burden as long as the pleadings clearly show that they \nlikely have standing. See Cartwright, 32 F.4th at 1119.  \n23 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 24 of 122\nStanding must also exist “for each claim” and “for each form of relief.” Davis \nv. FCC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008). Where multiple plaintiffs seek monetary damages \nin their own names, each plaintiff must establish standing. See TransUnion LLC v. \nRamirez, 594 U.S. 413, 417, 430–42 (2021) (holding, in a class action, that some \nmembers of the class had standing and others lacked standing); see also Town of \nChester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 440 (2017). But where multiple plaintiffs \nassert the same claim and seek the same relief, the court has jurisdiction if any \nplaintiff has standing. See Murthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1985 (“A proper case or controversy \nexists only when at least one plaintiff establishes that [it] has standing to sue.”) \n(quotation marks and some alterations omitted); see also Biden v. Nebraska, 600 \nU.S. __, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing \nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 n.9 (1977). Here, all eight plaintiffs seek the exact \nsame relief: a declaration that the Final Rule violates the APA, vacatur of the rule, a \nstay of the Final Rule’s effective date, and an injunction barring enforcement of the \nrule in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. (Doc. 1 at 83). Accordingly, \nas long as at least one of the plaintiffs has standing for each claim, the court has \njurisdiction over that claim. \na.  Injury in Fact \nAn injury in fact is “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is \n(a) concrete  and  particularized  and  (b)  actual  or  imminent,  not  conjectural  or \n24 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 25 of 122\nhypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (cleaned up). At the pleading stage, “general \nfactual allegations of injury can suffice, so long as the complaint plausibly and \nclearly alleges a concrete injury. “Only factual allegations, and not legal conclusions, \nare relevant to [the] inquiry, and mere conclusory statements do not suffice.” Glynn \nEnv’t  Coal.,  Inc.,  26  F.4th  at  1240  (cleaned  up).  In  addition  to  the  pleadings, \nPlaintiffs have also presented affidavits in support of their standing. (Docs. 7-2 to 7-\n13). And those affidavits echo the allegations made in the complaint. (Compare, e.g., \ndoc. 1 ¶¶ 91–103, with doc. 7-2 ¶¶ 8–19). \nBecause only one plaintiff needs to establish standing for this court to have \nsubject matter jurisdiction over this claim, see Murthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1985, the court \nwill discuss only Alabama. A State has standing to vindicate its own injuries. Biden, \n143 S. Ct. at 2366–68 (discussing Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368 (1953)). And \ninjuries to the instrumentalities of a State are injuries to the State itself. See, e.g., id. \nat 2366 (holding that a State had standing to vindicate the harms suffered by its \ninstrumentality, despite the separate corporate form, because that entity “was created \nby the State to further a public purpose, is governed by state officials and state \nappointees, reports to the State, and may be dissolved by the State”); see also, e.g., \nArkansas, 346 U.S. at 370 (“[A]s we read Arkansas law the University of Arkansas \nis an official state instrumentality; and we conclude that . . . any injury under the \ncontract to the University is an injury to Arkansas.”). Accordingly, Alabama has \n25 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 26 of 122\nstanding to vindicate its own injuries and the injuries of its public schools so long as \nits public schools are instrumentalities of the State.  \nAlabama law provides that its public universities are instrumentalities of the \nState. See Cox v. Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala., 49 So. 814, 817 (Ala. 1909) \n(holding that the University of Alabama “is a part of the state; that it was founded \nby the state; that it is under the state control, and that the University is therefore a \npublic municipal corporation; that as to its lands the state is and has always been the \ntrustee; and that the board of trustees are mere agents of the state”);  Hutchinson v. \nBd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala., 256 So. 2d 281, 283 (Ala. 1971) (“[P]ublic institutions \ncreated by the State [p]urely for charitable or educational purposes are a part of the \nState . . . .”); Harden v. Adams, 760 F.2d 1158, 1163–64 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding \nthat Alabama’s state universities are agencies or instrumentalities of Alabama). So \nAlabama is authorized to sue on behalf of its public schools, including its public \nuniversities, for the harms its public schools may suffer because of the Final Rule.  \nIt is undisputed that Alabama accepts federal funds for education programs or \nactivities and therefore is subject to Title IX and the Final Rule. (Doc. 1 ¶ 91; doc. \n7-2 ¶ 8); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,541. It is further undisputed that Alabama will \nneed  to  spend  “substantial  time  and  money”  to  bring  its  public  schools  into \ncompliance with the Final Rule. (Doc. 7-2 ¶ 16). Indeed, during the rulemaking \nprocess, the Department estimated that reviewing the Final Rule as a whole will take \n26 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 27 of 122\na Title IX coordinator four hours and will cost public schools $24,058,044 in the \nfirst year “across all recipients.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,867. Accordingly, at the time \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint, a school’s need to have its Title IX coordinator \nreview the Final Rule was “actual or imminent.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (quotation \nmarks omitted). \nb.  Traceability and Redressability \nBecause Plaintiffs have alleged and adduced evidence of an injury in fact, the \ncourt’s remaining standing analysis is quite straightforward. The remaining two \nelements consider whether Plaintiffs have shown “a causal connection between \n[their] injury and the challenged action of the defendant” and whether “a favorable \njudgment will redress [that] injury.” Lewis v. Governor of Alabama, 944 F.3d 1287, \n1296 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted) \nAt the time the complaint was filed, a court order staying the Final Rule or \nsetting it aside could have redressed Alabama’s injury because its public school’s \nTitle IX coordinators would not have to spend any further time reading the Final \nRule to determine what, if any, changes the institutions might have to make.5 See \nGlynn Env’t Coal., Inc., 26 F.4th at 1240. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiffs \n \n5 It is unclear to the court whether Title IX coordinators have since read and reviewed the \namended regulations. Their having done so would not change Plaintiffs’ standing at the time the \ncomplaint was filed, but it might eventually make part of the case moot if the Final Rule does not \nalter existing grievance procedures at the States’ institutions. Plaintiffs will need to address this \njurisdictional defect at summary judgment.  \n27 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 28 of 122\nhave  adequately  established,  at  the  preliminary  injunction  stage,  standing  to \nchallenge the Final Rule. See Murthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1986. \n2.  Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs argue the Final Rule violates the APA because some of the amended \nregulations are arbitrary, capricious, or “not in accordance with law.” See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A); (doc. 7-1 at 20). To determine whether an agency action is “not in \naccordance with law,” which the parties and the court refer to as “contrary to the \nlaw,” a court must exercise its independent judgment. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see \nLoper Bright Enter. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2273 (2024). To conduct that \nanalysis, the court uses traditional tools of statutory interpretation. See Loper Bright \nEnter., 144 S. Ct. at 2268, 2273.  \n  “The APA’s arbitrary-[or]-capricious standard requires that agency action be \nreasonable and reasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. \n414, 423 (2021). “Judicial review under that standard is deferential, and a court may \nnot substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.” Id. “A court simply \nensures that the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, \nhas  reasonably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  explained  the \ndecision.” Id.  \nAlthough “[a]n agency’s view of what is in the public interest may change[,] \n. . . . an agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis.” Motor Vehicle \n28 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 29 of 122\nMfrs. Assoc. of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 57 \n(1983). So an agency must assess the issues its rule creates and explain how the \nagency’s approach addresses those issues. Am. Clean Power Ass’n v. FERC, 54 F.4th \n722, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2022);6 see also, e.g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assoc. of the U.S., \nInc., 463 U.S. at 35, 37 (reiterating that an agency does not have “to consider all \npolicy alternatives in reaching [its] decision” but cannot abandon its prior positions \n“without  any  consideration  whatsoever”  of  its  prior  factual  findings  of  those \npositions). Additionally, an agency must consider contrary evidence. See FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  \nWith these legal principles in mind, the court turns to merits of Plaintiff’s \nclaims. The court’s analysis proceeds first to a preliminary issue of severability and \nthen the court examines each challenge to the Final Rule.  \na.  Severability \nPlaintiffs ask the court to stay the Final Rule’s effective date or enjoin the \nDepartment from enforcing any of the Final Rule in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, or \nSouth Carolina. (Doc. 7-1 at 57–58). In response, the Department contends that the \nFinal Rule is severable, so that if the court finds that any part of the Final Rule should \n \n6 Decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit are not binding on this court, but such \ndecisions may be cited as persuasive authority. See Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 613 F.3d 1058, \n1062 (11th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e consider decisions from other circuits as persuasive authority”); see \nalso Generali v. D’Amico, 766 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1985). The court finds the District of \nColumbia Circuit’s explanation of the law persuasive. \n29 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 30 of 122\nbe stayed or enjoined, the court should sever that part. (Doc. 24 at 69); see 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.46; 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (recodifying 34 C.F.R. § 106.46 as 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.48). Plaintiffs reply that the Department did not adequately brief the issue of \nseverability in its brief and has failed to carry its burden to show that the Final Rule \nis severable. (Doc. 38 at 35–36). The court will address Plaintiffs’ failure to sustain \ntheir burden first. \nPlaintiffs’ initial brief does not address severability. (See doc. 7-1). Yet they \nseek an order from this court staying or enjoining the entirety of the Final Rule, even \nthough  they  challenge  only  parts  of  it.  Because  Plaintiffs  bear  the  burden  of \nestablishing their entitlement to this extraordinary relief, see Benisek, 585 U.S. at \n158; see also Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176, they likewise bear an initial burden of \nshowing that, if any part of their challenge is successful, they can prevail as to the \nentirety of the Final Rule, see Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257, \n1275 n.31 (11th Cir. 2001) (observing that “[a]t the injunction stage, the burden \nremains in the party seeking restraint to demonstrate the likelihood of success on the \nmerits” even when a potential defense may be available); CBS Broad., Inc. v. \nEchoStar Commc’ns Corp., 265 F.3d 1193, 1202 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining that \neven “[w]here the ultimate burden of proof at trial is on the non-movant, the party \nseeking a preliminary injunction must nonetheless make some prima facie showing \nbefore the burden of production or proof shifts to the non-movant”); see also Canal \n30 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 31 of 122\nAuth. of Fla. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. 1974) (“[I]t should not have \nbeen incumbent upon the defendants to prove” that a preliminary injunction should \nnot be issued.).7 Because Plaintiffs did not even attempt to shoulder this burden in \ntheir initial brief (see generally doc. 7-1), their argument fails on that basis alone, \nsee Barber v. Governor of Alabama, 73 F.4th 1306, 1321 n.22 (11th Cir. 2023); Nat’l \nMining Ass’n v. United Steel Workers, 985 F.3d 1309, 1326 n.15 (11th Cir. 2021) \n(reiterating that arguments “fairly raised for the first time in reply briefs” “come too \nlate”) (quotation marks omitted).  \nSeparately, and even if the court considers all arguments regardless of when \nthey were raised, the arguments Plaintiffs made in their reply brief, supplemental \nbrief, and at oral argument are each deficient. In Plaintiffs’ reply brief, they rely on \nan  out  of  circuit  district  court  opinion  for  the  legal  framework,  without \nacknowledging its lack of binding authority on this court, and without attempting to \ndescribe what framework is or should be used in the Eleventh Circuit. (See doc. 38 \nat 36 (citing Texas v. United States, 691 F. Supp. 3d 763, 788 (S.D. Tex. 2023))). \nThis effectively puts the onus on this court to research and determine what test the \nEleventh Circuit uses to evaluate the severability of regulations and whether the \n \n7 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the \nEleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed \ndown before October 1, 1981. \n31 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 32 of 122\ndistrict court conducted a similar analysis. The court declines to undertake that task \nwhen the party seeking relief has not done so first.  \nDuring oral argument, Plaintiffs argued that severability is “a very obvious \nissue.” (Doc. 52 at 38). But if the issue was “very obvious,” Plaintiffs should have \naddressed the lack of severability in their initial brief rather than purposely ignoring \nit. See Suntrust Bank, 268 F.3d at 1276 n.31; CBS Broad., Inc., 265 F.3d at 1202; \nsee also Canal Auth. of Fla., 489 F.2d at 573. Plaintiffs then directed the court to the \nSupreme Court’s recent Ohio decision, which Plaintiffs contended places the burden \nof severability on the Department (see doc. 52 at 37–38).  \nThe  court  has  read  Ohio  and  concludes  that  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  it  is \nmisplaced. In that case, States submitted plans for implementing standards for air \npollutants set by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Ohio, 144 S. Ct. at \n2048. The EPA rejected twenty-three States’ plans and proposed a federal plan \nmeant to bind those States. Id. at 2049. Commenters warned that the EPA’s rejection \nof the States’ plans was flawed, so that adoption of a federal plan was impermissible. \nId. at 2050–51. In response, the EPA adopted a severability provision stating that if \na court found that the federal plan was invalid as to any State, the plan could still be \nimplemented  as  to  the  remaining  States.  Id.  at  2051;  see  also  Federal  “Good \nNeighbor  Plan”  for  the  2015  Ozone  Nat’l  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards,  88 \nFed. Reg. 36,654, 36,693 (June 5, 2023).  \n32 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 33 of 122\nThe EPA argued that the adoption of the severability provision meant the rule \nwas not arbitrary or capricious because it showed that the agency had considered \nwhether the federal plan could be applied to a “subset” of the twenty-three States. \nOhio, 144 S. Ct. at 2054 (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court held that, \nalthough  the  severability  provision  showed  “that  the  EPA  was  aware  of \n[commenters’] concerns,” the EPA “did not address the [commenters’] concern so \nmuch as sidestep it.” Id. at 2054–55. The Ohio court did not hold that, when a \nplaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining an entire rule, the agency bears the \nburden of showing that the rule is severable. Instead, the Ohio case addressed \nwhether adding a severability provision overcame the lack of reasonable explanation \nfor the agency’s original action. Id. at 2054–55. \nFinally, in supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs submitted two recent decisions \nfrom the Fifth and Sixth Circuit that, they say, “upheld . . . preliminary injunction[s] \nof  the  entire  rule”  in  part  because  the  Department  forfeited  any  severability \nargument. (Doc. 54 at 2). Plaintiffs misrepresent what the Fifth and Sixth Circuits \nheld.  \nIn Tennessee v. Cardona, the district court enjoined the entirety of the Final \nRule; the Department appealed and requested that the Sixth Circuit issue a partial \nstay of the injunction. No. 24-5588, 2024 WL 3453880, at *1–2 (6th Cir. 2024), \napplication for stay filed in Cardona v. Tennessee (U.S. July 22, 2024) (No. 24A79). \n33 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 34 of 122\nThe Department argued that § 106.10 did not exceed the Department’s statutory \nauthority  and  the  district  court’s  injunction  should  have  been  limited  to \n§ 106.31(a)(2)  and  § 106.2’s  definition  of  “hostile  environment  harassment”  as \napplied to “discrimination on the basis of gender identity.” Id. at *2. The Sixth \nCircuit held that the Department failed to satisfy its burden in requesting a stay \nbecause it had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim \nthat § 106.10 was within its statutory authority or that § 106.10 was severable from \nthe rest of the Final Rule. Id. at *2–4. One member of the panel dissented and \nexplained that he would have granted the stay because the Department had shown a \nsubstantial likelihood of success in its appeal of the injunction with respect to the \nparts of the Final Rule that the plaintiffs did not challenge. Id. at *5–7 (Mathis, J., \ndissenting).  \nThe Tennessee decision did not “uphold” the injunction issued by the district \ncourt (see doc. 54 at 2); the Department’s appeal of that injunction remains pending. \nAll  the  Tennessee  decision  did  was  deny  the  Department’s  request  for  the \nextraordinary relief of staying the district court’s order because the Department, as \nthe movant on appeal, had not carried its burden. Tennessee, 2024 WL 3453880, at \n*4. But here, Plaintiffs are the ones seeking extraordinary relief. \nThe same is true of Louisiana v. U.S. Department of Education. No. 24-30399, \n2024 WL 3452887 (5th Cir. 2024), application for stay filed in Dep’t of Educ. v. \n34 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 35 of 122\nLouisiana (U.S. July 22, 2024) (No. 24A78). The Fifth Circuit faced the same \nprocedural posture as the Sixth Circuit: the district court granted the plaintiffs an \ninjunction enjoining the entirety of the Final Rule; the Department appealed, and the \nDepartment moved for a partial stay of the district court’s injunction, relying “in part \non the [Final] Rule’s severability provision.” Id. at *1. The Fifth Circuit held that \nthe Department, as the movant, failed to carry its burden because it gave the Fifth \nCircuit “little basis to assess the likelihood of success,” either in its briefing on \nappeal or in its briefing to the district court. Id. at *1–2. By contrast, the plaintiffs \nhad “demonstrate[d] beyond peradventure in affidavits and submissions that an order \nallowing  the  Rule  to  remain  in  place  pending  appeal  would  inflict  enormous \nadministrative costs and great legal uncertainty on recipients of federal funds.” Id. \nat *2. One of the judges dissented without an opinion. Id. at *1 n.*. As with the \nTennessee case, the Louisiana case involved whether the Department showed its \nentitlement to relief. And unlike this case, the Louisiana plaintiffs presented both \nargument and evidence in support of their opposition to severability. \nHaving determined that Plaintiffs failed to prove that the Final Rule is not \nseverable, the court turns to the issue of whether the Department adequately briefed \nPlaintiffs’ failure. Where a party fails to address a relevant burden, the opposing \nparty need only raise the issue, not establish the movant’s inability to sustain it. See \nCBS Broad., Inc., 265 F.3d at 1202 (explaining how burden shifting might work \n35 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 36 of 122\nwhen the party who seeks a preliminary injunction does not bear “the ultimate \nburden of proof at trial”); see also, e.g., Willis v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 77 \nF.4th 1332, 1336 n.7 (11th Cir. 2023) (applying a similar rule at the summary \njudgment stage). Suffice it to say here that the Department clearly raised the issue, \ncited the specific applicable regulation supporting its claim, reiterated that Plaintiffs \nchallenge only portions of the Final Rule, and accurately quoted Supreme Court \nprecedent that addresses the severability issue. (Doc. 24 at 69 (citing Ayotte v. \nPlanned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 328–29 (2006))). In the light \nof the foregoing, the court will instead assume that the regulations in the Final Rule \nare  severable  pursuant  to  34  C.F.R.  §§ 106.9,  106.18,  106.24,  106.46,  106.62, \n106.72, and 106.82 because Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing they \nare not. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,848 (declining to change any of the severability \nregulations because of “the Department’s position that each of the provisions of \nthese final regulations discussed in this preamble serve an important, related, but \ndistinct purpose”). \nb.  Redefinition of Sex \nPlaintiffs’ first challenge is to a new regulation in the Final Rule to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. § 106.10. (Doc. 7-1 at 14–15, 20–35; see also, e.g., doc. 1 ¶¶ 162–89). \nSection  106.10  states  that  “[d]iscrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  includes \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or \n36 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 37 of 122\nrelated conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 \n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). Plaintiffs claim that § 106.10 is both contrary \nto the law and arbitrary or capricious. (Doc. 7-1 at 20). The court will examine each \nargument in turn. \ni.  Contrary to the Law \nPlaintiffs contend that § 106.10 is contrary to the text, history, and purpose of \nTitle IX because it illegally redefines “sex” to include gender identity (id. at 20–24) \nand violates the Spending Clause and major questions doctrine (id. at 24–26). As \nPlaintiffs currently present these arguments, they have not established substantial \nlikelihood of success on any of them. The court examines each.  \nRedefining Sex \nUnder Title IX, “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Title IX does not define “discrimination,” “on the \nbasis of,” or “sex.” See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); but see id. §§ 1681(c), 1689 (defining \nother terms). The word “sex” as used in Title IX is unambiguous and refers only to \nbiological  sex.  Adams,  57  F.4th  at  812,  815. And  “discrimination”  is  likewise \nunambiguous: “an intentional response” that subjects an individual “to differential \ntreatment.”  Jackson  v.  Birmingham  Bd.  of  Educ.,  544  U.S.  167,  174  (2005) \n37 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 38 of 122\n(collecting cases defining discrimination in the context of a retaliation claim); see \nalso id. at 175 (“Discrimination is a term that covers a wide range of intentional \nunequal treatment . . . .”) (quotation marks omitted). Finally, “on the basis of” \ngenerally “invokes but-for causation.” Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Cos., 93 F.4th 1181, 1192 \n(11th  Cir.  2024)  (examining  this  identical  language  in  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 and collecting cases involving “federal antidiscrimination \nlaws”) (quotation marks omitted). \n  In most instances, a school violates Title IX when an individual’s biological \nsex causes the school to “exclude” an individual from participation in, “deny” an \nindividual the benefits of, or otherwise treat an individual differently in  an education \nprogram or activity. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); Adams, 57 F.4th at 812, 815; Jackson, 544 \nU.S. at 174; Akridge, 93 F.4th at 1192. But in some instances, Title IX permits a \npublic school to treat an individual differently because of that individual’s biological \nsex.  \nTitle IX has several statutory exceptions, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)–(9) and \n1686, as well as regulatory exceptions, 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33 and 106.41, each of \nwhich  allow  different  treatment  between  the  biological  sexes.  Under  those \nprovisions, a school can exclude, deny, or otherwise treat an individual of one \nbiological sex differently than it treats individuals of the other biological sex. See 20 \n38 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 39 of 122\nU.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)–(9), 1686; 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33, 106.41. The Final Rule does \nnot alter or amend the language in any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions. \n  Plaintiffs first argue that § 106.10 redefines the word “sex” to include gender \nidentity, which Plaintiffs contend is an impermissible reading of Title IX. (Doc. 7-1 \nat 20). But Plaintiffs do not trouble themselves with presenting an argument on how \n§ 106.10 redefines the word “sex.” (Id. at 20–21). Instead, they recite the language \nof one statutory exception and three regulatory exceptions and conclude, without \nfurther argument, that “Title IX clearly does not cover discrimination based on \n‘gender identity.’” (Id. at 21 (emphasis added)). Because this argument lacks any \nmeaningful explanation, the court rejects it.  \n  Plaintiffs  next  argue  that  § 106.10  “steamrolls  [Title  IX’s]  text,  [the \nDepartment’s] own regulations, and the history of Title IX.” (Id.). But instead of \nengaging in any statutory interpretation of Title IX, Plaintiffs merely point out that \nthe Final Rules do not define “sex,” that the Department does not argue “sex” means \nanything other than biological sex, and the Department nevertheless maintains that \nsex discrimination encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity. (Doc. \n7-1 at 21). Without any analysis, Plaintiffs conclude that the Department “is playing \nword games” by assuming that “sex” means “biological sex” and “inject[ing], for \nthe first time, gender ideology into Title IX, contrary to longstanding practice and \n39 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 40 of 122\nthe  statute’s  original  public  meaning.”  (Id.  at  21).  Because  this  argument  is \nconclusory and lacks any meaningful explanation, the court rejects it.  \nPlaintiffs’ first non-conclusory argument is that the Department impermissibly \nrelied on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock to inform its “redefinition of \n‘sex.’” (Doc. 7-1 at 21). The Department does not deny that it relies on Bostock. \n(See, e.g., doc. 24 at 18). The Department maintains § 106.10 merely clarifies the \ndifferent types of sex discrimination Title IX prohibits and does so in a manner that \nis  compelled  by Title  IX’s  statutory  text  and  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in \nBostock. (Id. at 17–19). Plaintiffs’ argument does not include a discussion of the \nfacts, issue presented, or the Supreme Court’s holding in Bostock as part of its \nanalysis of why the Department cannot rely on it in enacting regulations, but the \ncourt will here. \nIn Bostock, three plaintiffs (two of whom were gay and one of whom was \ntransgender) sued their employers for sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). 590 U.S. at 653–54. The transgender employee began \nher employment “present[ing] as a male.” Id. at 653. Her “clinicians diagnosed her \nwith gender dysphoria and recommended that she begin living as a woman,” so the \nemployee “wrote a letter to her employer explaining that she planned to live and \nwork full-time as a woman.” Id. at 654 (quotation marks omitted). Her employer \nsubsequently fired her. Id. The employee sued, contending that her termination \n40 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 41 of 122\nviolated Title VII, which forbids employers from taking certain actions “because of” \nsex. Id.  \nThe Bostock Court assumed that “sex” in Title VII “refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.” Id. at 655 (quotation marks omitted). But \nthat did not end the Court’s inquiry because Title IX “prohibits employers from \ntaking certain actions ‘because of’ sex,” not “solely” because of sex or “primarily \nbecause of” sex. Id. at 656–57. “[T]he ordinary meaning of ‘because of’ is ‘by reason \nof’ or ‘on account of.’” Id. at 656 (citing University of Tex. Southwestern Medical \nCenter v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 350 (2013) and Gross v. FBL Financial Services, \nInc., 557 U.S. 167 (2009)) (cleaned up). And an employers’ decision can be “by \nreason of” or “on account of” more than one thing. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 \n(quotation  marks  omitted).  Thus,  whether  the  employee’s  complaint  stated  a \nviolation of Title VII depended on whether it plausibly alleged the employer’s \ndecision relied at least in part on the employee’s sex. Id. at 659–60.   \nApplying this rule to the transgender plaintiff, the Court concluded that the \nemployer violated Title VII when it terminated the employee for “plan[ning] to live \nand work full-time as a woman.” Id. at 654, 683 (quotation marks omitted). The \nCourt reasoned that “[i]f the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who \nwas identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person \nidentified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee \n41 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 42 of 122\nidentified as female at birth.” Id. at 660. Ultimately, the employee’s biological “sex \nplays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.” Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 660. And the role of biological sex in that calculus “defies the law.” Id. \nat 683.  \nAfter Bostock, the en banc Eleventh Circuit decided Adams. The facts of \nAdams are simple: a school board adopted a bathroom policy requiring individuals \nto use the restroom that aligned with that individual’s biological sex but “provid[ed] \naccommodative sex-neutral bathrooms” for transgender individuals. 57 F.4th at 802–\n03. A transgender student who desired to use a restroom that was consistent with the \nstudent’s gender identity but inconsistent with the student’s biological sex filed suit, \nalleging that the policy violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. Id. at 798.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that the school’s bathroom policy violated neither \nthe Equal Protection Clause nor Title IX. In its analysis of Title IX, the court first \nheld that “sex,” as used in Title IX, unambiguously means biological sex. Id. at 812–\n13. And because Title IX’s statutory language and the implementing regulations at \nthat time allowed schools to separate bathrooms by biological sex, id. at 812, 815 \n(discussing 20 U.S.C. § 1686 and 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.32(b) and 106.33), the student’s \nTitle IX claim failed.  \nPlaintiffs here contend that § 106.10 is contrary to the law because Adams \nheld that “Bostock does not apply to Title IX and is limited to Title VII” given the \n42 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 43 of 122\n“crucially different texts, histories, and purposes” of Title VII and Title IX. (Doc. 7-\n1 at 22). That is incorrect. The discussion Plaintiffs cite came from the part of the \nAdams opinion addressing whether the student could establish an equal protection \nviolation, not a Title IX violation. (Compare id. (citing Adams, 57 F.4th at 808)), \nwith Adams, 57 F.4th at 808. The student in Adams argued, and the district court \naccepted,  that  the  bathroom  policy’s  classification  based  on  sex  necessarily \nclassified based on transgender status under Bostock. Adams, 57 F.4th at 808. The \nEleventh Circuit rejected that argument because Bostock involved Title VII, not the \nEqual Protection Clause, and the policy did not “facially discriminate on the basis \nof transgender status.” Id. at 808–09. That part of the Adams opinion had nothing to \ndo with Title IX. \nAgain, Plaintiffs make no argument about the “texts, histories, and purposes” \nof Title VII and Title IX, such that the Department acted contrary to the law in relying \non Bostock. (See doc. 7-1 at 21–23). Nor does Adams address the “texts, histories, \nand  purposes”  of  those  statutes.  In  Adams,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  observed  that \n“Bostock held that discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status \nnecessarily  entails  discrimination  based  on  sex,  [and]  that  statement  is  not  in \nquestion in this appeal.” 57 F.4th at 808–09 (emphasis added; quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). In fact, the majority clearly stated that it could not, “as the Supreme \nCourt did in Bostock, decide only whether discrimination based on transgender status \n43 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 44 of 122\nnecessarily equates to discrimination on the basis of sex” to resolve the issue before \nit. Id. at 811. That is because the issue presented in Adams was whether the word \n“sex”  included  “gender  identity,”  not  whether  sex  discrimination  includes \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status. (See id.). Thus, the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold “that the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock is \nlimited to Title VII and does not extend to Title IX.” (Doc. 7-1 at 21); see also Clark \nv. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 379 (2005) (“This mistakes the reservation of a question \nwith its answer.”). Because the Department does not claim “sex” means anything \nother than biological sex, § 106.10 is not contrary to Adams. \nPlaintiffs next insist that Eknes-Tucker “reaffirmed Adams’s conclusion that \nBostock applies only to Title VII” because “‘Bostock relied exclusively on the \nspecific text of Title VII’ and ‘bears minimal relevance’ to cases with ‘a different \nlaw . . . and a different factual context.’” (Doc. 7-1 at 23 (quoting Eknes-Tucker, 80 \nF.4th at 1228–29)). The court has carefully reviewed Eknes-Tucker and is unable to \nfind any language limiting Bostock exclusively to Title VII.  \nIn Eknes-Tucker, the plaintiffs challenged a state statute criminalizing medical \ntreatment for the purpose of “alter[ing] [a minor’s] appearance” or “affirm[ing] the \nminor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is \ninconsistent  with  the  minor’s  sex”  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  and  Equal \nProtection Clause. 80 F.4th at 1210, 1218–19 (quotation marks omitted). The district \n44 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 45 of 122\ncourt granted preliminary relief in the plaintiffs’ favor, relying primarily on Bostock. \nSee id. at 1227–29. And the Eleventh Circuit reversed. Id. at 1210–11, 1228–29. \nThe Eknes-Tucker court reasoned that the Bostock decision “relied exclusively \non the specific text of Title VII,” but “[t]he Equal Protection Clause contains none \nof the text that the [Supreme] Court interpreted in Bostock.” Id. at 1228–29. So \nBostock had “minimal relevance to” the claims presented in Eknes-Tucker. 80 F.4th \nat 1229. The important lesson to be taken from Eknes-Tucker is the necessity of \ncarefully examining the relevant statutory language and factual context before using \nlegal standards from one statute to interpret a different statute. See id. at 1228–29; \naccord Liese v. Indian River Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 347 n.9 (11th Cir. 2012) \n(highlighting that the caselaw from one federal antidiscrimination statute “should \n[not] be automatically imputed to” another statute, but such caselaw “is instructive \nin situations where the Supreme Court’s reasoning naturally applies with equal force \nto the” other antidiscrimination statute). That careful examination is precisely what \nPlaintiffs failed to do in their request for preliminary injunctive relief. \nFinally, Plaintiffs contend that “[e]ven if Bostock applies” to Title IX, “the \nrule misapplies it.” (Doc. 7-1 at 24). Here, “the rule” to which Plaintiffs refer is \nunclear. To be sure, the argument is within Plaintiffs’ claim that § 106.10 is contrary \nto the law, and the brief lacks any indication of a transition to address a regulation \nother than § 106.10. But read in context, this argument appears to address §§ 106.33 \n45 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 46 of 122\nand 106.41(b). (See id. (distinguishing Bostock’s conclusion that sexual orientation \nor transgender status is irrelevant to employment decisions because “a student’s \nbiology is relevant to decisions about athletics, bathrooms, and locker rooms”) \n(emphasis  in  original)).  So  the  court  addresses  this  argument  with  respect  to \n§§ 106.33 and 106.41.  \nSection 106.33 permits schools to “provide separate toilet, locker room, and \nshower facilities on the basis of sex” as long as the “facilities provided for students \nof one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other \nsex.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. Similarly, § 106.41(b) permits schools to “operate or \nsponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is \nbased  upon  competitive  skill  or  the  activity  involved  is  a  contact  sport.”  Id. \n§ 106.41(b). The Final Rule does not amend §§ 106.33 or 106.41 in any way. See 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,887–88. But it does amend § 106.31(a)(2), which affects how schools \nmust operate their bathroom, shower, and locker room facilities.8  \n  Section 106.31(a)(2) provides that, in the circumstances in which the statute \nor the regulations “permit[] different treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a \nrecipient must not carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that \n \n8 The current version of § 106.31 does not contain subparagraph (a)(2). That subparagraph \nwill be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 on August 1, 2024. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. For ease of \nreference, the court will refer to this regulation as § 106.31(a)(2) in text, although the court’s \ncitations will be to its location in the Federal Register. \n46 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 47 of 122\ndiscriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than de minimis \nharm.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). The \nregulation further provides that “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents a person from participating in an education program or activity consistent \nwith the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on \nthe basis of sex.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \nThe regulation exempts from the de minimis harm standard any separation permitted \nby  the  statute  (i.e.,  20  U.S.C.  §§ 1681(a)(1)–(9)  and  1686)  and  regulations \ncorresponding to those sections of the statute (i.e., 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.12–106.15, \n106.32(b)(1), and 106.41(b)). Id. Because § 106.31(a)(2) exempts athletics from its \npurview, the court struggles to discern how § 106.31(a)(2) “misapplies” Bostock in \nthe context of sex-separate athletic programs. (See doc. 7-1 at 24). Accordingly, the \ncourt rejects Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the effect of the Final Rule on athletic \nprograms. \n  But § 106.31(a)(2) does not exempt § 106.33, which permits sex-separate \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). During rulemaking, the Department defended \nthe lack of exemption on the grounds that § 106.33 was not enacted in reliance on \nany statutory exemption in Title IX. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821. So the effect of § \n106.31(a)(2) on § 106.33 is that a school may have sex-separated bathrooms, locker \n47 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 48 of 122\nrooms, and showers, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, but it must permit students to use the \nfacility corresponding to their gender identity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  \nPlaintiffs do not include § 106.31(a)(2) as part of, or in addition to, their \nargument that § 106.10 is contrary to the law or their claim that “the rule” misapplies \nBostock. (See doc. 7-1 at 20–24). Indeed, Plaintiffs appear to avoid § 106.31(a)(2) \nthroughout  their  brief,  citing  to  it  only  once  in  their  background  section  and \nproviding explicit argument about it only in its argument that the treatment of \nbathrooms is arbitrary or capricious. (Id. at 14, 29). Because Plaintiffs’ argument that \n“the rule” misapplies Bostock refers only to regulations that the Final Rule does not \nchange (id. at 24) and does not attempt to argue how “the rule’s” misapplication \nimpacts § 106.33 (id. at 20–24), the argument fails.   \nSpending Clause \nCongress passed Title IX pursuant to its authority under the Spending Clause. \nAdams, 57 F.4th at 815; U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. “[L]egislation enacted pursuant \nto the spending power is a species of contract.” West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. \nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1141 (11th Cir. 2023) (quotation marks \nomitted). To that end, a condition on funding must be: (1) ascertainable, meaning \n“[a] state must . . . clearly understand the obligations of the deal,” id. at 1143 \n(quotation marks omitted; alterations accepted), and (2) voluntarily accepted, which \n48 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 49 of 122\nrequires that the condition imposed by the federal government not be “so coercive \nas to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion,” NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 580 (2012) (quoting South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987)). \nPlaintiffs argue that § 106.10 violates “the Spending Clause’s clear-statement rule” \nand is coercive. (Doc. 7-1 at 24–25 (quotation marks omitted)).  \nFirst, “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal \nmoneys under its Spending Clause authority, it must do so unambiguously.” Adams, \n57 F.4th at 815 (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, \n17 (1981)) (alterations accepted). This clarity “must come directly from the statute.” \nMorrisey, 59 F.4th at 1147 (quotation marks omitted). So an agency has “authority \nto fill in gaps that may exist in a[n] [unambiguous] spending condition,” but an \nagency cannot “impose a condition that is not otherwise ascertainable in the law \nCongress enacted.” Id. at 1147–48.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because Title \nIX did not put them on notice that a public school could not separate bathrooms, \nliving facilities, and sports based on biological sex. (Doc. 7-1 at 25). Because \nPlaintiffs have been imprecise about which specific regulations they challenge under \nthe Spending Clause, the court pauses to clarify.  \nNothing in the Final Rule purports to affect the statutory exemption for sex-\nseparate living facilities provided by 20 U.S.C. § 1686 or to affect sport regulations. \n49 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 50 of 122\nIndeed, § 106.31(a)(2) explicitly exempts both forms of sex separation. See 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,887–88. The only change affecting bathrooms precipitated by the \nFinal Rule is § 106.31(a)(2). See id. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31); \nsee also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818–21. The court therefore limits its discussion to \n§ 106.31(a)(2) in connection with § 106.33. \nThe first inquiry is whether “Congress . . . spell[ed] out a condition clearly \nenough for the states to make an informed choice.” Morrisey, 59 F.4th at 1142 \n(quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs do not argue that Title IX is itself ambiguous \nor that the condition it imposed (not to discriminate based on sex) is unclear; to the \ncontrary, they correctly maintain that the statute is unambiguous. (See doc. 7-1 at \n25–26); see Adams, 57 F.4th at 815. Instead, they argue that “the rule,” which the \ncourt  assumes  is  § 106.31(a)(2),  does  not  “match  Congress’s  unambiguous \ncommand” in Title IX. (Doc. 7-1 at 26 (quotation marks omitted)). In other words, \nthis is a challenge to § 106.31(a)(2) as being contrary to Title IX.  \nBut Plaintiffs do not explain their position that § 106.31(a)(2) is contrary to \nthe law; they instead refer to their argument that § 106.31(a)(2) is arbitrary or \ncapricious. (See doc. 7-1 at 26, 28–35). As the court explains below, Plaintiffs have \nnot carried their burden of establishing a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits  of  their  claim  that  § 106.31(a)(2)  is  arbitrary  or  capricious.  Plaintiffs’ \ncircuitous argument therefore does not establish a substantial likelihood of success \n50 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 51 of 122\non the merits of the claim that the Department violated the Spending Clause by \nenacting the Final Rule as a whole.  \nSecond,  a  condition  is  coercive  if  “the  financial  inducement  offered  by \nCongress was so coercive to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.” \nSebelius, 567 U.S. at 581 (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs argue “the rule” \n(again, without specifying which regulation they mean) “jeopardizes billions of \ndollars for each State” which is “a significant amount of these States’ education-\nrelated funding,” thereby “leaving the States with no real option but to acquiesce.” \n(Doc. 7-1 at 25 (quotation marks and emphasis omitted)).  \nWhen  considering  whether  Congress’s  financial  inducement  is  coercive, \ncourts consider what percent of the State’s budget is comprised of the federal funds \nat issue. E.g., Sebelius, 567 U.S. at 581–82. A condition which threatens to withhold \nfederal  funds  that  is  “less  than  half  of  one  percent  of  [a  State’s]  budget”  is \npermissible “encouragement” because it “remain[s] the prerogative of the States” to \ndecline such funds and institute its own policies. Id. (summarizing Dole, 483 U.S. at \n211–12) (quotation marks omitted). But a condition that threatens “the loss of over \n10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves \nthe States with no real option but to acquiesce” to the financial inducement. Id. These \nprecedents require the court to consider not only the amount of funding at stake but \nthe effect of losing that funding in the context of the State’s total budget. See id. \n51 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 52 of 122\nPlaintiffs present evidence of the amount of federal funding they receive for \npublic education. (See doc. 7-1 at 25 (citing doc. 7-2 ¶¶ 8–9; doc. 7-3 ¶¶ 5–6; doc. \n7-8 ¶¶ 5–6; doc. 7-10 ¶¶ 5–6)). They do not present evidence or argument about their \ntotal budgets or what percentage of their budget the education funding comprises. \n(See id. (citing doc. 7-2 ¶¶ 8–9; doc. 7-3 ¶¶ 5–6; doc. 7-8 ¶¶ 5–6; doc. 7-10 ¶¶ 5–6)). \nThe Department identified this deficiency in response to Plaintiffs’ motion. (Doc. 24 \nat 59). Plaintiffs did not correct this deficiency in their reply brief (see doc. 38 at 11–\n12) and declined to offer witness testimony during the hearing (doc. 52 at 3–4). In \nthe absence of such evidence, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood \nof success that the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because it is unduly \ncoercive.  \nMajor Questions \nPlaintiffs’ major questions doctrine argument also fails. (See doc. 7-1 at 26–\n27). The major questions doctrine applies to “extraordinary cases . . . in which the \n‘history and the breadth of the authority that the agency has asserted,’ and the \n‘economic and political significance’ of that assertion, provide a ‘reason to hesitate \nbefore concluding that Congress’ meant to confer such authority.” West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022) (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 159–60 (2000)) (alterations accepted). Mindful that Congress \ndoes not “typically use oblique or elliptical language to empower an agency to make \n52 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 53 of 122\na radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme,” the court considers “whether \nCongress in fact meant to confer the power the agency has asserted.” EPA, 597 U.S. \nat 721, 723 (quotation marks omitted). An agency must “point to clear congressional \nauthorization to justify the challenged” action. Biden, 143 U.S. at 2375 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nPlaintiffs argue that several reasons, considered together, show that §§ 106.10 \nand  106.31(a)(2)  involve  a  major  question.  (Doc.  7-1  at  26–27).  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule, in general, “seeks to intrude into [education,] an \narea that is the particular domain of state law” (id. at 26 (quotation marks omitted)); \n§ 106.10’s  redefinition  of  “sex  . . .  breaks  new  ground  on  issues  of  political \nsignificance” (id. at 27 (quotation marks omitted)); the rulemaking process for the \nFinal Rule resulted in 240,000 comments, “most of which were negative,” and the \nDepartment  delayed  issuing  the  Final  Rule  “because  of  the  extraordinary \nsignificance  of  its  decision”;  (id.);  “sex-separated  facilities  and  athletics  raise \nquestions that are personal and emotionally charged” (doc. 7-1 at 27 (quotation \nmarks and alteration omitted)); and Congress tried and failed to amend Title IX “to \nadd gender identity and sexual orientation” (id. (quotation marks omitted)).  \nThose reasons can be placed into two groups. The first group are the reasons \nPlaintiffs  do  not  substantiate.  For  example,  Plaintiffs  state  that  education  is \nhistorically an area of state sovereignty and the Final Rule in general intrudes in that \n53 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 54 of 122\ndomain, but they do not refer to any specific amended regulation, state law, or even \ntheir  complaint,  to  support  that  statement.  (Id.  at  26–27).  Another  example  is \nPlaintiffs’ representation that Congress has tried and failed “to add gender identity \nand sexual orientation” to Title IX. (Id. at 27 (quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs’ \nbrief cites no evidence to establish whether that is true, or the precise action Congress \nwas considering but failed to enact. (Doc. 7-1 at 27; see also id. at 10–13). And the \ncourt declines to look outside Plaintiffs’ brief to find evidence they neither cite nor \nattach in support of their request for extraordinary relief. \nThe second group (i.e., the political significance of the issue, the volume and \nnature of comments during rulemaking, and the “personal and emotionally charged” \nnature of the subject matter), are reasons that show the Final Rule regulates a \ncontroversial subject matter. (See doc. 7-1 at 27 (quotation marks omitted)). But a \nregulation related to a controversial subject, without more, does not mean it is a \n“major policy decision[ ]” or an “extraordinary case.” See EPA, 597 U.S. at 721–23. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs provide no support for their assertion that the 240,000 \ncomments  the  Department  received  were  mostly  negative;  their  citation  to  the \nFederal  Register  supports  only  the  assertion  that  the  Department  received  that \nvolume of comments. (See doc. 7-1 at 27 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,477)). They \nlikewise provide no support for their assertion that the Department delayed issuance \nof the Final Rule “because of [its] extraordinary significance.” (See doc. 7-1 at 27). \n54 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 55 of 122\nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs assert that athletics raises a “fundamental issue[] of \nour  time”  (id.  (quotation  marks  omitted)),  § 106.31(a)(2)  exempts  sex-separate \nathletics, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \nFinally,  they  provide  no  evidence  that  sex-separation  of  bathrooms  is  of  such \nimportance that it rises to a major question, instead stating in a conclusory manner \nthat it “plainly” does. (Doc. 7-1 at 27). The court declines to issue extraordinary \nrelief based on such a conclusory argument. \nSeparately, and even assuming Plaintiffs have shown this is an extraordinary \ncase in which the major questions doctrine applies, the Department “must point to \nclear congressional authorization for the power it claims.” EPA, 597 U.S. at 723 \n(quotation marks omitted). The Department points to two places: the unambiguous \ntext  of  Title  IX’s  general  prohibition  of  discrimination  and  its  authority  to \npromulgate regulations. (See doc. 24 at 62–63). Because the court has found that \nPlaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success that § 106.10 is \ncontrary to the law or that any other amended regulations are arbitrary or capricious, \nthe court likewise finds that Plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood \nof success that the Department lacks clear congressional authorization for the power \nit claims.  \n55 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 56 of 122\nii. Arbitrary or Capricious  \nIn  the  alternative,  Plaintiffs  contend  that  they  are  substantially  likely  to \nsucceed  on  their  request  to  permanently  set  aside  “the  rule”  because  “[t]he \nredefinition  of  sex  discrimination  is  arbitrary  or  capricious.”  (Doc.  7-1  at  28 \n(emphasis omitted)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (permitting this court can set \naside agency action on that basis). Before the court determines whether “the rule” is \narbitrary and capricious, it must again identify “the rule” at issue in this part of \nPlaintiffs’ brief. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  § 106.10  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  because  the \nDepartment did not engage in reasoned decisionmaking in “at least” six ways: by \n(1) making a mess of the Department’s own regulations by creating a “confusing” \nregulatory scheme regarding bathrooms; (2) failing to meaningfully “consider[] how \nthe redefinition [of sex discrimination] affects sports”; (3) failing to adequately \ndefine  gender  identity;  (4) failing  to  consider  public  schools’  reliance  interests \nregarding sex-separate bathrooms and sports; (5) failing to adequately explain the \nimpact of a recent Supreme Court standard on the de minimis harm standard; and \n(6) failing to adequately consider parental rights. (Doc. 7-1 at 28–35). \nOnly one of those six ways (the failure to define “gender identity”) relates to \n§ 106.10.  The  bathroom  regulation  is  found  in  § 106.33  and  is  affected  by \n§ 106.31(a)(2), not § 106.10; the failure to consider the impact of the regulations on \n56 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 57 of 122\nsports is, likewise, affected by § 106.31(a)(2), not § 106.10; the reliance interests \nrelate to bathrooms and sports; the de minimis standard is found in § 106.31(a)(2); \nand parental rights are addressed in § 106.6(g) and (e). See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33, \n106.41(b); 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.6); 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31); but see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to \nbe codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs contend that \n§ 106.10 is arbitrary or capricious because the Department failed to engage in \nreasoned decisionmaking in enacting §§ 106.31(a)(2) or 106.6, they have not carried \ntheir burden of showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. To the \nextent they  contend that §§ 106.31(a)(2) and  106.6  are themselves  arbitrary or \ncapricious, the court will address those arguments separately. \nAgency actions are arbitrary or capricious when the agency (1) “relied on \nfactors Congress did not intend it to consider,” (2) “entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem,” (3) “offered an explanation for its decision that \nruns counter to the evidence before the agency,” or (4) takes action “so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.” Ga. Dep’t of Educ. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 883 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir. \n2018) (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs often do not explain the precise way in \nwhich the Department has failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking. So when \nthe court examines Plaintiffs’ arguments, the court attempts to identify the precise \n57 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 58 of 122\nchallenge Plaintiffs have made, but the court observes that this imprecision is yet \nanother example of how the underdeveloped legal arguments “make[] it harder for” \nPlaintiffs “to meet [their] burden of proof.” Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1175. \nThe court begins with the only argument relating to § 106.10: “the fail[ure] to \n. . . define gender identity.” (Doc. 7-1 at 30 (quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs \ncontend that the lack of definition is arbitrary or capricious because it does not \nprovide any guidance about what gender identities schools must accept or how \nschools can verify a student’s gender identity. (Id. at 30–31). Plaintiffs’ argument \nappears to be that the Department “entirely failed to consider an important aspect \nof” the effect of § 106.10 during the rulemaking process. Ga. Dep’t of Educ., 883 \nF.3d at 1314 (quotation marks omitted).  \nDuring the rulemaking process, the Department declined to “further clarify” \nthe meaning of gender identity and explained that it “understands gender identity to \ndescribe an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be different \nfrom their sex assigned at birth.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809. The Department explained \nthat it did not need “to articulate a specific definition” because multiple court \ndecisions had used the term in a manner consistent with that understanding. Id. As \nfor verification, the Department stated that many recipients already “rel[ied] on a \nstudent’s  consistent  assertion  to  determine  their  gender  identity,  or  on  written \nconfirmation of the student’s gender identity by the student or student’s parent, \n58 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 59 of 122\ncounselor, coach, or teacher.” Id. at 33,819. The Department further explained that \n“requiring . . . invasive medical inquiries or burdensome documentation” would not \nbe  appropriate  and  that  schools  could  not  require  “documentation  (such  as  an \namended birth certificate or evidence of medical treatment) . . . if access to such \ndocumentation is prohibited by law in that jurisdiction.” Id. This court cannot find \nthat the Department “entirely failed to consider” the issues of how schools can define \nand verify students’ gender identities. See Ga. Dep’t of Educ., 883 F.3d at 1314 \n(quotation marks omitted).  \nPerhaps,  as  a  matter  of  policy,  a  uniform  set  of  gender  identities  and \nverification procedures would be helpful. But this court may not make its own policy \njudgments in conducting a review of whether an agency’s action was arbitrary or \ncapricious. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423; see also Ohio, 144 S. Ct. \nat 2053. The Department elected to provide schools flexibility in their approach to \nverify a student’s gender identity and it provided an explanation for why it chose \nthat route. Plaintiffs have not explained how the Department’s action was arbitrary \nor capricious. (See doc. 7-1 at 30–32).  \nInstead, Plaintiffs rely on an out-of-circuit decision addressing the “fair notice \ndoctrine,” which provides that due process requires an agency to provide clarity in \nits statements and regulations before imposing “drastic” sanctions. (Id. at 31); Wages \n& White Lion Invs., LLC v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 375 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc), cert. \n59 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 60 of 122\ngranted FDA v. Wages & White Lion, No. 23-1038, 2024 WL 3259693 (U.S. July 2, \n2024). Plaintiffs have offered nothing other than a citation to this case to explain \nhow the fair notice doctrine applies. (See doc. 7-1 at 31). And the court has doubts \nabout its application in this Circuit. See Glob. Green, Inc. v. SEC, 631 F. App’x 868, \n870 (11th Cir. 2015) (observing that the doctrine applies “only in a very limited set \nof cases”) (quotation marks omitted); Crimson Stone v. Fed. Mine Safety, 198 \nF. App’x 846, 850 (11th Cir. 2006).  \nPlaintiffs’ final argument relating to the definition of gender identity is that \nthe Department did not adequately explain how “its rule” applies to nonbinary \nstudents. (Doc. 7-1 at 32). Although Plaintiffs make arguments about whether a \nnonbinary  person  could  show  but-for  causation  supporting  a  claim  of  sex \ndiscrimination for being denied access to a bathroom, they do not cite any part of the \nFinal Rule in which a commenter raised this issue and the Department declined to \nrespond.  (See  id.). The  sole  citation  Plaintiffs  provide  is  to  a  page  where  the \nDepartment stated that a public school could coordinate with a nonbinary student \nand the student’s parent or guardian to determine how to provide that student access \nto facilities. (See id. (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have \nnot established that the Department entirely failed to consider important aspects of \n“its  rule”  (see doc.  7-1  at  32) or  that its  considerations  exceeded  the  zone  of \n60 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 61 of 122\nreasonableness, see Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423; see also Ohio, 144 \nS. Ct. at 2053. \nPlaintiffs’ remaining challenges relate to bathrooms, sports, reliance interests, \nand parental rights. Plaintiffs’ first argument is that “the rule announces that schools \nviolate Title IX if they don’t allow transgender students access to the bathroom” \ndesignated  for  the  sex  with  which  the  student  identifies  and  that  this \n“announce[ment]” makes a “mess” of existing regulations. (Doc 7-1 at 28). Plaintiffs \ndo not cite the current or amended regulations relating to bathrooms. (See id. at 28–\n29). But for the reader’s ease, the court will again explain how these regulations \nwork.  \nSection 106.33 permits schools to provide separate bathrooms “on the basis \nof sex” as long as the separate facilities are “comparable.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \nSection 106.31 provides that “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents a person from participating in an education program or activity consistent \nwith the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on \nthe basis of sex.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \nThe effect, as the Department concedes, is that although public schools may continue \nto separate bathrooms by biological sex, such schools may not bar a student from \nusing the bathroom of the student’s gender identity, even if that student’s gender \n61 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 62 of 122\nidentity does not match the student’s biological sex. (See doc. 52 at 47–48, 53–54; \ndoc. 24 at 28–29).  \nPlaintiffs argue that this is arbitrary or capricious because it “makes a mess” \nof the regulations and causes the regulations to conflict with each other. (Doc. 7-1 at \n28). As an initial matter, Plaintiffs assertion that the two regulations conflict and are \n“a mess” is conclusory, at best. But on a more substantive level, Plaintiffs, the court, \nand the Department appear to all be able to understand the effect of these two \nregulations: a school may have sex-separate bathrooms, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33, yet may \nnot prevent a student from accessing such a facility in a manner that is inconsistent \nwith that student’s gender identity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.31(a)(2)). And  Plaintiffs  have  not  challenged  the  Department’s  proffered \nexplanation for its change. (See doc. 7-1 at 28). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not \ncarried  their  burden  of  establishing  substantial  likelihood  of  success  that  this \nregulation exceeds the bounds of reasonableness.  \nNext,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Department  failed  to  consider  how  the \n“redefinition of sex discrimination” impacts sports. (Id. at 29–30). Plaintiffs insist \nthat the Department’s refusal to address sports in the Final Rule is arbitrary or \ncapricious because the Department did not refuse to address bathrooms in the Final \nRule, even though the bathroom and sports regulations were originally enacted in \nthe “same batch of regulations,” which “Congress did not disapprove.” (Id. at 29). \n62 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 63 of 122\nThe court first notes that when Congress has not enacted a joint resolution of \ndisapproval of an agency rule, the court is prohibited from inferring “any intent of \nthe Congress from any action or inaction of the Congress with regard to such rule, \nrelated statute, or joint resolution of disapproval.” 5 U.S.C. § 801(g). Consistent with \nthis directive, the court declines Plaintiffs’ invitation to glean intent from the fact \nthat “Congress did not disapprove” the Department’s initial “batch of regulations” \nregarding sports and athletics. (Doc. 7-1 at 29); 5 U.S.C. § 801(g). \nPlaintiffs do not explain why an agency’s passage of a rule amending an old \nrule requires that the agency also address every other rule passed at the same time. \n(See doc. 7-1 at 29–30). Nor do Plaintiffs cite any authority for this specific position. \n(See id.). So again, the court is left with an argument that is presented only in legal \nconclusions. Without any supporting explanation or authority, Plaintiffs have not \ncarried  their  burden  of  establishing  substantial  likelihood  of  success  that  this \nregulation exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. \nThe same is true of Plaintiffs’ claim that the Department failed to consider the \nStates’  reliance  interests  in  creating  sex separate  bathrooms,  locker  rooms  and \nshowers. (See id. at 32–34). Although Plaintiffs argue that the Department did not \nassess whether reliance interests weighed against separation based on biological sex \nin “athletics programs and intimate spaces,” they do not cite any comments raising \nthis issue or any part of the Final Rule to show that this assertion is true, leaving this \n63 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 64 of 122\ncourt to comb the hundreds of pages of the Final Rule on its own. (See id. at 32); see \nalso Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 20 (2020) \n(“Deciding whether agency action was adequately explained requires, first, knowing \nwhere to look for the agency’s explanation.”). The court declines to do so and will \nlimit itself to the arguments made in Plaintiffs’ brief. \nPlaintiffs assert that the Department failed to consider the use of single-\noccupancy bathrooms (doc. 7-1 at 33) (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820), but the part \nof the Final Rule that they cite states that “nothing in Title IX or the final regulations \nprevents  a  recipient  from  offering  single-occupancy  facilities,  among  other \naccommodations” and that “access to gender-neutral or single-occupancy facilities \nmay be helpful.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820. Plaintiffs cite the same section of the \nFederal Register to show that the Department did not adequately consider safety and \nprivacy concerns (doc. 7-1 at 33–34), but that section incorporates the Department’s \nnotice of proposed rulemaking, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820, which found that multiple \ncourt decisions had found no such risks, 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,535–36.  \nAt their core, Plaintiffs’ arguments are not that the Department exceeded the \nzone of reasonableness, but rather, that Plaintiffs disagree as a policy matter. (See, \ne.g., doc. 7-1 at 34). The “court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that \nof the agency.” Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. In the absence of any \nadequate argument about why the Department’s explanation was so lacking that it \n64 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 65 of 122\nwas arbitrary or capricious, Plaintiffs have not established substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits that the Department did not consider their reliance interests. \nNext, Plaintiffs challenge the de minimis standard adopted in § 106.31(a)(2) \non the ground that the Department failed to consider the Supreme Court’s decision \nin Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 144 S. Ct. 967 (2024). (Doc. 7-1 at 34–35). In \nMuldrow (issued twelve days before issuance of the Final Rule), the Supreme Court \nheld that an employee can prevail on a Title VII claim even without showing \n“serious, . . . substantial,” or “significant” harm from discriminatory treatment. 144 \nS. Ct. at 974. Plaintiff argues that the Department acted arbitrarily or capriciously by \n“fail[ing] to consider this” new harm standard and why it “does not unravel [the \nDepartment’s] heavy reliance on the concept of ‘de minimis harm.’” (Doc. 7-1 at \n34–35).  \nThe court begins by noting the decided oddity of Plaintiffs challenging the \nDepartment’s failure to consider a Title VII case in enacting § 106.31(a)(2), given \ntheir dismay at the Department’s reliance on another Title VII case (Bostock) in \nenacting § 106.10. (See id. at 22–23). Putting that aside, however, Plaintiffs do not \nexplain  how  the  de  minimis  standard  set  out  in  § 106.31(a)(1)  conflicts  with \nMuldrow.  (See  id.  at  34–35).  Plaintiffs  therefore  have  not  provided  adequate \nargument for the court to find a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the \n65 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 66 of 122\nclaim that § 106.31(a)(2) is arbitrary or capricious because the Department failed to \nadequately consider Muldrow. \nPlaintiffs’ final assertion of arbitrariness or capriciousness relates to parental \nrights. (See id. at 35). They argue that the Final Rule “says it trumps parents’ rights, \nincluding their right to access their child’s information under FERPA and state laws.” \n(Doc. 7-1 at 35). Here, Plaintiffs cite to specific parts of the Final Rule in support of \ntheir argument. (See id.) (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.6)). But their citations do not support their argument. \nDuring the rulemaking process, the Department clarified that “nothing in these \nfinal regulations prevents a recipient from disclosing information about a minor \nchild to their parent who has the legal right to receive disclosures on behalf of their \nchild” and “nothing in the final regulations restricts any right of a parent to act on \nbehalf of a minor child or requires withholding of information about a minor child \nfrom their parents.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,822. Indeed, the new regulation § 106.6(g) \nprovides that “[n]othing in Title IX or this part may be read in derogation of any \nlegal right of a parent, guardian, or other authorized legal representative to act on \nbehalf of a complainant, respondent, or other person, subject to paragraph (e) of this \nsection.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(g)).  \nSection (e) in turn provides that “[t]he obligation to comply with Title IX and \nthis  part  is  not  obviated  or  alleviated  by  FERPA,  20  U.S.C.  1232g,  or  its \n66 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 67 of 122\nimplementing regulations, 34 CFR part 99.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(e)).  The court assumes that this provision is what Plaintiffs rely \non, but Plaintiffs have not explained what part of the Final Rule conflicts with \nFERPA. (See doc. 7-1 at 35). Instead, they misleadingly contend that the Department \n“decline[d] to opine” on whether parents would lose parental rights. (Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted)). But the part of the commentary Plaintiffs quote for that proposition \nwas actually “declin[ing] to opine on how § 106.31(a)(2) interacts or conflicts with \nspecific State laws because it would require a fact-specific analysis.” 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,822. That declination has nothing to do with any conflict with FERPA or any \nobligation to withhold information from parents. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not \nestablished a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the claim that § 106.6 \n“trumps parents’ rights” and is therefore arbitrary or capricious. (Doc. 7-1 at 35).  \nBased on the foregoing, the court WILL DENY Plaintiffs’ motion for stay of \neffective  date  or  preliminary  injunction  on  the  grounds  that  the  Department’s \nadoption of § 106.10 was arbitrary or capricious. \nc.  Redefinition  of  Sex-Based  Harassment  and  Recipient \nObligations \nPlaintiffs argue the amendments to §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) redefine hostile-\nenvironment sex-based harassment in a way that is contrary to the law and arbitrary \nor capricious. (See doc. 7-1 at 36–46). The court will first summarize the current and \namended regulations before turning to Plaintiffs’ arguments.  \n67 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 68 of 122\nThe current regulations define “sexual harassment” to mean, in relevant part, \n“[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the . . . \neducation program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a)(2). It also defines “actual \nknowledge”  to  mean  “notice  of  sexual  harassment  or  allegations  of  sexual \nharassment to a recipient’s Title IX Coordinator or any official of the recipient who \nhas authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the recipient, or to any \nemployee of an elementary and secondary school.” Id. § 106.30(a). The regulation \nspecifically provides that “[i]mputation of knowledge based solely on vicarious \nliability or constructive notice is insufficient to constitute actual knowledge.” Id. \n§ 106.30(a).  \n  Amended  § 106.2,  on  the  other  hand,  defines  “sex-based”  “hostile \nenvironment harassment” as “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so \nsevere or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit  from  the  . . .  education  program  or  activity  (i.e.,  creates  a  hostile \nenvironment).”  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,884  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R.  § 106.2) \n(emphasis  added).  Amended  § 106.2  also  clarifies  that  “[w]hether  a  hostile \nenvironment has been created is a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration” \nof various factors including, among other factors, “[t]he degree to which the conduct \n68 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 69 of 122\naffected the complainant’s ability to access the . . . education program or activity”; \n“[t]he type, frequency, and duration of the conduct”; and “[t]he location of the \nconduct and the context in which the conduct occurred.” Id. at 33,884 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). And amended § 106.44(f)(1) requires that when a school’s \nTitle IX coordinator is “notified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX or this part,” the coordinator must “promptly and \neffectively end any sex discrimination.” Id. at 33,889 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.44(f)(1)).  \ni.  Contrary to the Law \nPlaintiffs argue the amendments to §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are contrary to \nthe law for two reasons. First, they contend that hostile-environment harassment is \nbroader than the standard articulated in Davis. (Doc. 7-1 at 39). Second, relying \npredominantly on the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Cartwright, Plaintiffs argue \namended  §§ 106.2  and  106.44(f)(1)’s  breadth  likely  violates  students’  First \nAmendment rights. (See id. at 38–39). The court examines each argument in turn.  \nDeviation from the Davis Standard \nPlaintiffs maintain that amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are contrary to the \nlaw because they include three material changes from the Davis standard. Those \nthree changes are (1) the expansion of protected conduct to include “severe or \npervasive” conduct rather than “severe and pervasive” conduct; (2) the expansion of \n69 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 70 of 122\nharm  to  include  harassment  that  “limits”  a  person’s  ability  to  participate  in  a \nprogram,  rather  than  only  “denies”  participation;  and  (3)  the  inclusion  of  a \nrequirement that a recipient “promptly and effectively end any sex discrimination,” \nrather than not be deliberately indifferent to such discrimination. (See doc. 7-1 at 38) \n(emphasis  added).  For  its part,  the  Department  does not  dispute  that  amended \n§§ 106.2  and  106.44(f)(1)  are  broader  than  the  standard  in  Davis  because  the \nDepartment’s position is that it is not required to adopt the Davis standard. (See doc. \n24 at 39–41); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498 (“The Department’s final definition is \nnot identical to Davis, however, because the Department also believes a broader \nstandard is appropriate to enforce Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in the \nadministrative context . . . .”).  \nIn Davis, the Supreme Court considered whether a public school may be liable \nfor damages under Title IX for student-on-student sexual harassment. 526 U.S. at \n639.  Plaintiffs  correctly  state  that  Davis  “authoritatively  defined  when  sexual \nharassment by students makes a school liable for sex discrimination under Title IX.” \n(Doc. 7-1 at 39). But Plaintiffs ignore that Davis did not address the harassment \nstandard  Title  IX  imposes  on  school  administrators  to  maintain  their  Title  IX \nfunding, which is the standard the Final Rule amends. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 639 \n(“[W]e are asked to do more than define the scope of the behavior that Title IX \nproscribes. We must determine whether a district’s failure to respond to student-on-\n70 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 71 of 122\nstudent harassment in its schools can support a private suit for money damages.”) \n(emphasis added). \nAt oral argument, Plaintiffs cited for the first time NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. \n459 (1999) for the proposition that private and administrative enforcement standards \nshould  be  the  same.9  (See  doc.  52  at  23).  But  NCAA  does  not  stand  for  that \nproposition. In a footnote, the Court in NCAA rejected an argument that the private \nenforcement  standard  could  be  broader  than  the  administrative  enforcement \nstandard. See 525 U.S. at 467 n.5. The Supreme Court did not reject that argument \nbecause private and administrative enforcement standards must be the same; instead, \nthe  Court  reasoned  that  a  private  right  of  action  cannot  be  broader  than  the \nadministrate enforcement standard because “it would be anomalous to assume that \nCongress intended the implied private right of action to proscribe conduct that \n[g]overnment enforcement may not check.” Id. at 467 n.5.  \nHere, Plaintiffs are challenging the amendments to §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) \nbecause  the  private  right  of  action  would  be  narrower  than  the  administrative \nenforcement standard. (See doc. 7-1 at 15). But Davis’s own language strongly \nsuggests the standards are different: “[W]e are asked to do more than define the \n \n9 Plaintiffs did not cite NCAA in their initial brief or reply brief. (See docs. 7-1, 38). Of \ncourse, the court does not consider new arguments raised for the first time at oral argument. See \nHernandez v. Plastipak Packaging, Inc., 15 F.4th 1321, 1330 (11th Cir. 2021). To the extent that \nPlaintiffs raised this argument in its briefs and merely presented new authority for that argument \nat oral argument, the court nevertheless rejects it.  \n71 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 72 of 122\nscope of the behavior that Title IX proscribes. We must determine whether a district’s \nfailure to respond to student-on-student harassment in its schools can support a \nprivate suit for money damages.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 639. Accordingly, as a threshold \nmatter, Plaintiffs have not established substantial likelihood of success on the merits \nthat Davis is a controlling standard in the administrative enforcement context.  \n  The Department is also not required to adopt Davis as the standard for student \ndiscipline to extinguish all “constitutional concerns,” as Plaintiffs seem to suggest. \n(See doc. 7-1 at 36, 39). Davis did not adopt the standard for sex-based harassment \nto avoid constitutional concerns, as Plaintiffs contend. (See id. at 36). Rather, the \n“practical realities” of different fact patterns and potential exposure to constitutional \nor  statutory  claims  necessitated  the  “deliberately  indifferent”  theory  of  direct \nliability only when the school’s “response . . . or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable \nin light of the known circumstances.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 648–49; see also id. at 653. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have again failed to sustain their burden based on Davis.  \n  Because Plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success that \nDavis  forecloses  agency  interpretation  of  sex-based  harassment,  the  court  will \nanalyze  whether  amended  §§ 106.2  and  106.44(f)(1)  are  contrary  to Title  IX’s \nlanguage. The analysis is straightforward: Title IX prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of sex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Sex-based harassment can rise to the level of \n72 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 73 of 122\ndiscrimination for purposes of Title IX. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 639. Plaintiffs do not \nargue otherwise. (Doc. 7-1 at 36–39).  \nBut  none  of  the  changes  Plaintiffs  identify  in  amended  §§ 106.2  and \n106.44(f)(1) conflict with that statutory language. The rule’s inclusion of conduct \nthat is severe or pervasive does not prohibit conduct the statute’s language permits.  \nNor does including language that harassment is actionable if it limits access \nto educational benefits conflict with the statutory language. Again, Title IX prohibits \nany person being “excluded from participation in, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or \nbe[ing] subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a). The Department contends that because Title IX contains “be \nexcluded from participation in” and “be denied the benefit of” language, the statute \ncannot  mean  only  “denies.”  (Doc.  24  at  42).  It  argues  the  “excluded  from \nparticipation” language exclusively covers a denial of benefits such that Congress’s \ninclusion  of  the  “denied  the  benefit  of”  language  would  be  surplusage.  (Id.). \nPlaintiffs do not respond to that argument. (Doc. 38 at 17–20). And therefore, \nPlaintiffs have not carried their burden of “clearly establish[ing]” their entitlement \nto relief. Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176.  \nFinally, there is no statutory authority to suggest that requiring a recipient to \nrespond  to  complaints  of  sex-based  discrimination  “promptly  and  effectively” \nviolates Title IX’s requirement that the Department implement rules that effectuate \n73 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 74 of 122\nthe objectives of the statute. 20 U.S.C. § 1682; see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (to be \ncodified  at  34  C.F.R.  §  106.44(f)(1)).  Although  Plaintiffs  cite  amended \n§ 106.44(f)(1) in their brief (see doc. 7-1 at 38), Plaintiffs do not appear to make any \nsubstantive argument that a “prompt” investigation of sex-based discrimination is \ncontrary to Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination (see id. at 38–39). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have again failed to carry their burden as to amended § 106.44(f)(1).  \nFirst Amendment Considerations \n  Relying primarily on the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Cartwright, Plaintiffs \ncontend that amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are contrary to the law because the \nnew definition of sex-based harassment is so broad it will likely violate students’ \nFirst Amendment rights. (See id. at 38–39). Plaintiffs separately argue that the \namended regulations are arbitrary or capricious because Cartwright held a similar \npolicy was likely overbroad. (Id. at 43–45; doc. 38 at 11–13; doc. 52 at 23–27). In \nthis section, the court will analyze only the arguments that Plaintiffs have clearly \nbriefed as being contrary to the law, beginning with explaining the Cartwright \ndecision.  \n  In  Cartwright,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  considered  challenges  to  a  public \nuniversity’s two speech-related policies, of which only one is relevant to this case. \n32  F.4th  at  1113.  That  policy,  which  the  Eleventh  Circuit  characterized  as \n“staggeringly broad”:  \n74 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 75 of 122\n(1) prohibit[ed] a wide range of “verbal, physical, electronic, and other” \nexpression concerning any of (depending on how you count) some 25 \nor so characteristics; (2) stat[ed] that prohibited speech “may take many \nforms,  including  verbal  acts,  name-calling,  graphic  or  written \nstatements”  and  even  “other  conduct  that  may  be  humiliating”; \n(3) employ[ed] a gestaltish “totality of known circumstances” approach \nto determine whether particular speech, for instance, “unreasonably . . . \nalters” another student’s educational experience; and (4) reach[d] not \nonly  a  student’s  own  speech,  but  also  her  conduct  “encouraging,” \n“condoning,” or “failing to intervene” to stop another student’s speech. \n \nId. at 1125. Because this policy “cover[ed] substantially more speech than the First \nAmendment permits,” the Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs had established \nsubstantial likelihood of success that the policy was “fatally overbroad.” Id.  \n  Plaintiffs argue amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are contrary to the law \nbecause they have two provisions materially similar to the policy in Cartwright. \n(Doc. 7-1 at 38–39). Those provisions are: (1) the prohibition on severe or pervasive \nlanguage; and (2) the inclusion of actionable harassment that limits as well as denies \nthe terms and conditions of a program or activity. (Id. at 38). \n  The policy in Cartwright did indeed contain those terms, but the opinion never \ndiscussed them as causing the policy’s potential constitutional overbreadth. 32 F.4th \nat 1125. Although Plaintiffs characterize the rules as “materially similar,” they offer \nno argument demonstrating why that is so. (Doc. 7-1 at 38–39). They cite only the \nparts of Cartwright that are the same as the amended regulations here yet say nothing \nabout the parts that are different. (See id.). In short, Plaintiffs’ argument is this: \namended §§ 106.2 and 106.44 are contrary to the law because the Eleventh Circuit \n75 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 76 of 122\nheld  that  a  somewhat  similar  rule  was  “almost  certainly  unconstitutionally \noverbroad.” (Id.) (quoting Cartwright, 32 F.4th at 1125 (emphasis added)).  \nBut that argument is not sufficient to satisfy Plaintiffs’ burden of showing a \nsubstantial likelihood on the merits of their claim that this policy is constitutionally \noverbroad—particularly in the absence of any argument regarding why amended \n§§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are similar to the Cartwright policy and in the absence of \nany acknowledgement regarding why the differences between amended §§ 106.2 \nand 106.44(f)(1) and the Cartwright policy are immaterial. (See id.). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success on their argument \nthat amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are unconstitutionally overbroad.  \nii.  Arbitrary or Capricious \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  amended  §§ 106.2  and  106.44(f)(1)  are  arbitrary  or \ncapricious. (Doc. 7-1 at 40–46). They argue the Department failed to consider, or \nmeaningfully address, three problems: (1) amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1)’s \ndeparture from the Davis standard, (2) those amended regulations’ likelihood of \nviolating the First Amendment, and (3) concerns that a harassment policy following \nthese amended regulations would treat misgendering—i.e., not using a person’s \npreferred pronouns—as sex-based harassment. (Id.). The Department responds that \nit adequately addressed all those concerns and that its rule is within the zone of \n76 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 77 of 122\nreasonableness to survive arbitrary-or-capricious review. (Doc. 24 at 43–47). The \ncourt will address each of Plaintiffs’ arguments in turn.  \nDeviation from the Davis Standard \n  First, consistent with their contrary to the law argument, Plaintiffs argue the \nDavis standard is the exclusive standard for Title IX sex-based harassment. (Doc. 7-\n1 at 40–42). And from that premise, they argue the amended regulations’ deviation \nfrom the Davis standard is arbitrary or capricious because the Department had no \nauthority to do so. (See id. at 41).  \nUnlike their contrary to the law arguments, Plaintiffs maintain that Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371 (2005) precludes a statute from imposing two standards of \nliability. (Id. at 40). The question presented in Clark was whether a Supreme Court \ndecision that imposed a limiting construction to an immigration statute’s application \nto one group of aliens should apply equally to the statute’s application to another \ngroup  of  aliens.  543  U.S.  at  378–79.  The  Court  reasoned  that  although  the \nconstitutional concerns that motivated its limiting construction for one group of \naliens were not present for the other group, the statute’s language treats both groups \nthe same and the limiting construction must therefore apply to all person subject to \nthe statute. Id. at 380. Plaintiffs do not make any argument that Clark’s reasoning \ndoes, or should, apply when construing the standard or standards to be used for \nliability under an implied private right of action versus an explicit directive requiring \n77 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 78 of 122\nadministrative enforcement of conditions recipients accepted in exchange for federal \nfunds. Cf. Davis, 526 U.S. at 639 (“[W]e are asked to do more than define the scope \nof the behavior that Title IX proscribes. We must determine whether a district’s \nfailure to respond to student-on-student harassment in its schools can support a \nprivate suit for money damages.”). Instead, Plaintiffs simply conclude that under \nClark, amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are arbitrary or capricious. (See doc. 7-1 \nat 40).  This does not suffice to carry Plaintiffs’ burden.  \nIn the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that even if there can be different standards, \nthe Department failed to reasonably explain how a school can have “one harassment \npolicy  to  avoid  private  liability  but  different  harassment  policy  to  avoid \nadministrative enforcement.” (See doc. 7-1 at 41). They reason that “schools must \nadopt the more draconian one to avoid penalties—rendering Davis a dead letter.” \n(See id.). As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not explained why a recipient’s desire \nto  maintain  two  separate  policies  would  make  the  Department’s  regulations \ngoverning administrative enforcement arbitrary or capricious. (See id.). But in any \nevent, the  Department reasonably addressed  that  concern. See  89  Fed.  Reg.  at \n33,499–500.  \nAgain, Davis established that a student can use the implied private right of \naction to seek private money damages from a recipient when the recipient was \ndeliberately indifferent to student-on-student harassment of which it had actual \n78 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 79 of 122\nknowledge. 526 U.S. at 643. In the Final Rule, the Department explained that private \nlawsuits for damages provide no opportunity to a recipient to take corrective actions, \nbut in the administrative enforcement context, the Department gives schools notice \nand an opportunity to comply with its rules before it terminates federal funding. 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,500; see also 20 U.S.C. § 1682. The Department further reasoned \nthat the Davis standard “does not provide a reason to conclude that the harassing \nstudent or employee is immune from [internal] disciplinary action” simply because \nthe school was not deliberately indifferent to harassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,499. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have not established substantial likelihood of success that \nDepartment’s failed to consider these concerns or that its decisionmaking exceeded \nthe zone of reasonableness. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \n  Plaintiffs also challenge the Department’s reasoning that “limits or denies” is \nthe same as Davis’s “denies” requirement. (Doc. 7-1 at 42). As an initial matter, \nPlaintiffs fail to provide evidence that the Department claims the standards are \nidentical; indeed, the citation Plaintiffs provide for this assertion does not support it. \n(See id.) (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511).  \nDuring the rulemaking process, the Department explained its view that “[i]f \nTitle IX only covered exclusion from participation or denial of access, there would \nhave been no reason for Congress to add ‘be denied the benefits of.’” 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,511. The Department concluded that “[a] limitation on equal access constitutes \n79 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 80 of 122\na denial of benefits.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). So under the Final Rule, “a \ncomplainant must demonstrate some impact on their ability to participate or benefit \nfrom the education program or activity, but the definition [of sex-based hostile \nenvironment harassment] does not specify any particular limits or denials.” Id. This \ndiscussion  reflects  the  Department’s  view  of  “the  full  scope  of  Title  IX’s \nnondiscrimination mandate,” but the Department does not appear to suggest that \n“limits  or  denies”  is  the  same  as  Davis’s  “denies”  requirement.  Rather,  the \nDepartment’s position appears to be that its “limits or denies” language is consistent \nwith Title IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination. See id. \nPlaintiffs next argue that amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1)’s inclusion of \nharassment that “limits” a person’s participation in or benefit from a program is \nvague, a low bar, and amorphous. (Doc. 7-1 at 42) (quotation marks omitted). But \nPlaintiffs do not provide the court with any persuasive argument explaining why \n“limits” is so amorphous that it is an unworkable standard. (See id. at 42–43). \nAlthough  they  cite  Cartwright  to  support  that  proposition,  Cartwright  did  not \ndescribe “limits” as vague, a low bar, or amorphous. See 32 F.4th at 1121. Instead, \nthe “amorphous” quote on which Plaintiffs rely described the policy’s prohibition on \nspeech that “unreasonably . . . alter[s]” a student’s experience. Id. In short, Plaintiffs \nhave failed to show the Department’s inclusion of the word “limits” fell outside the \nzone of reasonableness. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \n80 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 81 of 122\n  First Amendment Considerations \n  Second, Plaintiffs argue amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are arbitrary or \ncapricious because the Department failed to reasonably explain how those amended \nregulations can be reconciled with the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Cartwright, \nwhere the Eleventh Circuit found a university harassment policy likely violated the \nFirst Amendment. (Doc. 7-1 at 43–45).  \nAs  an  initial  matter,  to  the  extent  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  amended \nregulations are facially unconstitutional, a challenge for being arbitrary or capricious \nis not the proper vehicle to do so. The plaintiffs in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc. took a similar approach by repeatedly referring to the First Amendment within \nthe context of their arbitrary-or-capricious argument. 556 U.S. at 516. If Plaintiffs \nhere “invite [the court] to apply a more stringent arbitrary-[or]-capricious review to \nagency actions that implicate constitutional liberties,” the court follows the Supreme \nCourt and rejects the invitation. Id. “If the [agency]’s action here was not arbitrary \nor capricious in the ordinary sense, it satisfies the Administrative Procedure Act’s \narbitrary or capricious standard; its lawfulness under the Constitution is a separate \nquestion to be addressed in a constitutional challenge.” Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. at 516 (quotation marks omitted). \nThe court therefore limits its discussion to whether Plaintiffs have adequately \nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the Department \n81 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 82 of 122\nunreasonably  considered  Cartwright.  (Doc.  7-1  at 43–45). They have not. The \nDepartment addressed how the amended regulations are materially distinguishable \nfrom Cartwright as well as other First Amendment concerns. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. \nat  33,494–96  (vagueness  and  overbreadth);  id.  at  33,501  &  n.11  (discussing \nCartwright and chilled speech); id. at 33,501–08 (First Amendment considerations). \nThe  Department  also  analyzed  cases  from  other  circuits  that  support  the \nDepartment’s  reasoning  that  the  amended  regulations  do  not  violate  the  First \nAmendment. See id. at 33,494–95; Rowles, 983 F.3d at 352; DeJohn v. Temple Univ., \n537 F.3d 301, 320 (3d Cir. 2008) (“Yet, unless harassment is qualified with a \nstandard  akin  to  a  severe  or  pervasive  requirement,  a  harassment  policy  may \nsuppress core protected speech.”).  \n  The Department acknowledged it was changing its position and explained that \nit thinks the new regulations are better aligned with Title IX. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,490, 33,499–500; see Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515 (“[I]t suffices \nthat the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for \nit, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course \nadequately indicates.”). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the claim that the Department failed to consider these \nconcerns  or  that  its  decisionmaking  exceeded  the  zone  of  reasonableness.  See \nPrometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \n82 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 83 of 122\nMisgendering  \n  Third,  Plaintiffs  argue  the  Department  failed  to  reasonably  respond  to \ncomments that amended §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1)’s harassment language could \nrequire schools to punish students for misgendering another person. (See doc. 7-1 at \n45–46). In response to similar concerns during rulemaking, the Department reasoned \nthat  “whether  verbal  conduct  [such  as  misgendering]  constitute  sex-based \nharassment is necessarily fact-specific” and that “a stray remark, such as a misuse \nof language, would not constitute harassment under this standard.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,516.  \nPlaintiffs argue “[t]hat terse statement is hardly reasoned decisionmaking.” \n(Doc. 7-1 at 46) (quotation marks omitted). But the Department addressed the \ncommentors’ questions about whether misgendering could constitute harassment \nunder the amended regulations: it reasoned a stray instance of misgendering would \nnot be actionable, but like any other instance of verbal conduct, additional conduct \ncould turn the misgendering into actionable harassment. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516; \nsee Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. And amended § 106.2 sets out \nfactors to consider when deciding if conduct creates a hostile environment, which \nwould guide a Title IX coordinator in his or her determination. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2).  \n83 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 84 of 122\n  In short, although Plaintiffs may dislike the Department’s rules, they have \nfailed  to show  a  substantial likelihood of success in proving the  Department’s \nrulemaking was unreasonable or not reasonably explained under APA’s deferential \narbitrary-or-capricious standard. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. \nAccordingly, the court WILL DENY Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction \non their claim that §§ 106.2 and 106.44(f)(1) are contrary to the law or arbitrary or \ncapricious.  \nd.  Procedural Requirements \nPlaintiffs  challenge  the  removal of  the  procedures  set  out  in  the  current \nregulations to address “formal complaints” of “sexual harassment.” (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 207–\n23); 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b). Plaintiffs contend that the amended regulations to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.46(g), 106.45(b)(2), 106.45(f), and 106.45(h)(1) are \narbitrary or capricious because they remove procedures that provided due process \nprotections.  (Doc.  7-1  at  46–54;  see  doc.  1  ¶¶ 211–23).  But  their  substantive \nargument is that the reduction in protections has constitutional implications for \nstudents accused of sexual misconduct. (See doc. 7-1 at 46–54). They do not argue \nthat amended §§ 106.46(g), 106.45(b)(2), 106.45(f), and 106.45(h)(1) are facially \nunconstitutional but instead limit their argument to the “due-process concerns” \nraised by some of these changes. (Doc. 7-1 at 47–52). As the court explained above, \nsupra at 82, “[i]f the [agency]’s action here was not arbitrary or capricious in the \n84 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 85 of 122\nordinary sense, it satisfies the Administrative Procedure Act’s arbitrary or capricious \nstandard; its lawfulness under the Constitution is a separate question to be addressed \nin  a  constitutional  challenge.”  Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  at  516 \n(quotation marks omitted).  \nTo  the  extent  Plaintiffs  intended  to  argue  that  amended  §§ 106.46(g), \n106.45(b)(2),  106.45(f),  and  106.45(h)(1)  are  unconstitutional,  they  have  not \nadequately raised that argument for the court’s consideration at the preliminary \ninjunction  stage,  where  they  bear  the  burden  of  “clearly  establish[ing]”  their \nentitlement to relief. Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176. The court limits itself to Plaintiffs’ \nargument  that  the  parts  of  the  Final  Rule  that  they  challenge  are  arbitrary  or \ncapricious. The court will first summarize how the grievance process operates under \nthe  current  and  amended  regulations.  The  court  will  then  examine  Plaintiffs’ \narguments regarding each individual change in turn. Finally, the court will consider \nPlaintiffs’ arguments regarding the cumulative effect of the changes.  \ni.  The Grievance Process \n  Section 106.45(b) of the current regulations require initiation of the grievance \nprocess  “[u]pon  receipt  of  a  formal  complaint.”  34  C.F.R.  § 106.45(b)(2)(i). A \n“[f]ormal complaint” is defined as “a document filed by a complainant or signed by \nthe Title IX Coordinator” that alleges sexual harassment and requests investigation \nof the allegation. Id. § 106.30(a).  \n85 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 86 of 122\nThe investigation requires “an equal opportunity for the parties” to inspect \nand review all relevant evidence obtained in the investigation and to present fact and \nexpert witnesses. Id. § 106.45(b)(5)(ii), (vi). Each party has the opportunity to be \naccompanied  to  all  related  proceedings  by  an  advisor  of  their  choice.  Id. \n§ 106.45(b)(5)(iv). The advisor can be an attorney. 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(5)(iv). \nPostsecondary institutions have to provide a live hearing at which “each party’s \nadvisory [may] ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and \nfollow-up questions, including those challenging credibility.” Id. § 106.45(b)(6)(i).  \nThe decisionmaker “cannot be the same person(s) as the Title IX Coordinator \nor the investigator(s).” Id. § 106.45(b)(7)(i). The regulation gives institutions the \noption  to  use  either  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  standard  or  a  clear  and \nconvincing evidence standard, so long as the institution uses “the same standard of \nevidence for formal complaints against students as for formal complaints against \nemployees, including faculty, and  . . . the same standard of evidence [for] all formal \ncomplaints of sexual harassment.” Id. § 106.45(b)(1)(vii). \nThe Final Rule removes the mandatory nature of many of those protections. \nAmended § 106.45 sets out grievance procedures applicable to all complaints of sex \ndiscrimination  and  amended  § 106.46  sets  out  additional  grievance  procedures \napplicable to complaints of sex-based harassment involving student complainants or \nstudent respondents at postsecondary institutions. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,891, 33,893. \n86 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 87 of 122\nThe amended regulations now define a “complaint” as “an oral or written request to \nthe recipient that objectively can be understood as a request for” an investigation. 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,882 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). And when a Title IX \ncoordinator is “notified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination \nunder Title IX or this part,” the Title IX coordinator must determine whether to \ninitiate a complaint of sex discrimination of their own initiative based on a non-\nexhaustive list of considerations. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.44(f)(1)(v)).  \nThe amended regulations permit institutions to provide either access to “the \nrelevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence” or a description of the evidence \nwith a statement that the parties may request access to the evidence. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,892 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(f)(4)(i)–(ii)); id. at 33,894 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(e)(6)). Parties have the right to present fact witnesses \nand “inculpatory and exculpatory evidence that [is] relevant and not otherwise \nimpermissible,”  Id.  at  33,892  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R.  § 106.45(f)(2)),  but \npostsecondary institutions may bar expert witnesses “as long as the determination \napplies  equally  to  the  parties,”  Id.  at  33,894  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.46(e)(4)). Parties still have the right to an advisor, who may be an attorney, \nbut the institution “may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which the \n87 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 88 of 122\nadvisor may participate in the grievance procedures, as long as the restrictions apply \nequally to the parties.” Id. at 33,894 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(e)(2)). \nAmended  § 106.46  allows  postsecondary  institutions  to  elect  whether  to \nprovide live hearings for complaints of sex-based harassment involving student \ncomplainants or student respondents. Id. at 33,895 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.46(g)). If the institution elects not to provide a live hearing, the investigator or \ndecisionmaker must be able to ask questions during individual meetings with the \nparties or witnesses; each party is allowed to propose questions to ask the parties or \nwitnesses and, if the questions are relevant and not otherwise impermissible, the \ninvestigator or decisionmaker must ask those questions during individual meetings; \nand the institution must provide “an audio or audiovisual recording or transcript with \nenough time for the party to have a reasonable opportunity to propose follow-up \nquestions.” Id. at 33,894 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(f)(i)).  \nSchools must use a preponderance of evidence standard “unless the recipient \nuses the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in all other comparable \nproceedings, including proceedings relating to other discrimination complaints, in \nwhich case the recipient may elect to use that standard of proof in determining \nwhether sex discrimination occurred.” Id. at 33,893 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.45(h)(1)).  The  “decisionmaker  may  be  the  same  person  as  the  Title  IX \n88 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 89 of 122\nCoordinator or investigator.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.45(b)(2)).  \nii.  Live Hearing and Cross-Examination \nAmended  §  106.45  eliminates  two  mandatory  procedural  requirements \npresent  in  the  current  regulations:  a  live  hearing  and  direct  adversarial  cross-\nexamination. Plaintiffs contend that the Department’s explanation does not provide \nadequate justification for the change in light of the “grave due-process concerns” in \ncases involving witness credibility. (Doc. 7-1 at 46–49).  \nThe  current  regulations  mandate  a  live hearing  for  complaints  of  sexual \nharassment  at  postsecondary  institutions.  34  C.F.R.  § 106.45(b)(6)(i).  At  the \nhearing, each party’s advisory can “ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant \nquestions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility. Such \ncross-examination at the live hearing must be conducted directly, orally, and in real \ntime by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party personally.” Id. The \ndecisionmaker  must  determine  whether  each  question  was  relevant  before  the \nwitness answers it. Id. \nThe  amended  regulations  permit  but  do  not  require  a  live  hearing  for \ncomplaints of sex-based harassment involving a student complainant or student \nrespondent at a postsecondary institution. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,895 (to be codified at \n34 C.F.R. § 106.46(g)). If the institution does not have a live hearing, the investigator \n89 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 90 of 122\nor decisionmaker must be able to ask relevant and not otherwise impermissible \nquestions and follow-up questions during individual meetings with the parties and \nwitnesses, including relevant and permissible questions proposed by the parties. Id. \nat 33,894 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(f)(i)(A)–(C)). The postsecondary \ninstitution must provide both parties an audio or audiovisual recording or transcript \nwith enough time for the parties to have a reasonable opportunity to propose follow-\nup questions. Id. \nIn the commentary to the 2020 Rule, the Department noted that the U.S. \nSupreme Court has not clarified the precise due process requirements for complaints \nof  sexual  harassment  at  postsecondary  schools.  85  Fed. Reg.  at  30,327.  The \nDepartment  acknowledged  that  the  Sixth  Circuit  has  held  that  where  a  public \nuniversity  seeks  to  discipline  a  student  for  misconduct  based  on  “competing \nnarratives,” “some form of live questioning in front of the fact-finder” is required, \nDoe v. Baum, 903 F.3d 575, 578, 583 (6th Cir. 2018) (emphasis omitted). 85 \nFed. Reg. at 30,327–28. The First Circuit has held that a school’s questioning of the \nwitnesses was sufficient to satisfy due process, Haidak v. Univ. of Mass.-Amherst, \n933 F.3d 56, 68–70 (1st Cir. 2019). 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,329. The Department elected \nto follow Baum because, although that decision was limited to public universities \nthat  are  required  to  provide  due  process,  the  Department  believed  “consistent \napplication  of  a  grievance  process  to  accurately  resolve  allegations  of  sexual \n90 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 91 of 122\nharassment under Title IX is as important in private institutions as public ones.” Id. \nat 30,328.  \nIn its notice of proposed rulemaking, which preceded the Final Rule, the \nDepartment  stated  that  “some  postsecondary  institutions  reported  that  they \nexperienced a decrease in the number of complaints filed as well as an increase in \nthe number of individuals who report sexual harassment but decline to move forward \nwith  the  grievance process  once  they  are  provided with  information  about  the \ngrievance  process.”  87  Fed. Reg.  at  41,505.  The  schools  making  those  reports \nattributed these changes to the requirement of a live hearing and advisor-conducted \ncross-examination requirements. Id. And some postsecondary institutions had found \nthe  live  hearing  and  cross-examination  requirements  “overly  burdensome  and \nprescriptive,” interfering with their “ability to meet their Title IX obligations.” Id. \nThe Department also acknowledged comments expressing a preference for the 2020 \nRule from “several non-recipient stakeholders.” Id. In eliciting comments about the \nproposed changes, the Department explained its “tentative view . . . that neither Title \nIX nor due process and fundamental fairness require postsecondary institutions to \nhold a live hearing with advisor-conducted cross-examination in all cases,” but that \ninstitutions must “provide a live-questioning process that enables the decisionmaker \nto  adequately  assess  the  credibility  of  the  parties  and  witnesses  to  the  extent \ncredibility is in dispute and is relevant.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,505. \n91 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 92 of 122\nIn its comments regarding the amended regulations, the Department stated it \nhad  received  a  “variety  of  views . . .  regarding  whether  due  process  and  basic \nfairness require live hearings with questioning by an advisor for all complaints of \nsex-based harassment involving a student complainant or student respondent at a \npostsecondary institution.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,733. The Department reiterated the \nlack of Supreme Court guidance and the split among courts, including two more \nrecent decisions holding that due process was satisfied by live questioning by the \nfactfinder if the respondent had an opportunity to submit questions. Id. at 33,736 \n(citing Overdam v. Texas A&M Univ., 43 F.4th 522, 529–30 (5th Cir. 2022) and \nBoermeester v. Carry, 532 P.3d 1084, 1098 (Cal. 2023)). After discussing the \ncaselaw, the Department maintained its position “that neither Title IX nor due \nprocess or basic fairness require postsecondary institutions to hold a live hearing \nwith questioning by an advisor in all cases” because a due process analysis involves \nreviewing “the specific facts and circumstances to determine what process was \nrequired, including what other procedural protections, if any, were provided to the \nrespondent and the potential burden on the postsecondary institution of requiring \ncross-examination at a live hearing.” Id. at 33,734, 33,736. \nThe Department’s review of the caselaw “persuaded [it] that affording more \ndiscretion to recipients to develop processes for conducting grievance procedures is \nappropriate.”  Id.  at  33,737.  The  Department  stated  that  it  believed  the  new \n92 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 93 of 122\nprocedures protected “the ability to probe the credibility of parties and witnesses; \nand also protect the postsecondary institution’s interest in helping the decisionmaker \nseek the truth and make a reliable determination, while minimizing any chilling \neffects on reporting of sex-based harassment and on full participation of parties and \nwitnesses  in  the  grievance  procedures.”  Id.  at  33,734.  And  the  Department \nemphasized  that  nothing  in  amended  §§ 106.45  or  106.46  “precludes  a \npostsecondary institution from choosing to use a live hearing with questioning by an \nadvisor.” Id. at 33,737.  \nPlaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their claim that this change is arbitrary or capricious. As the \ncourt stated  above,  to  the  extent  Plaintiffs  contend  that  this change  is  facially \nunconstitutional as a violation of due process, that contention is irrelevant to the \narbitrariness or capriciousness of the rule. See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \nat 516. So the court turns to Plaintiffs’ arguments that the Department failed to \nmeaningfully  explain  its  departure  from  the  current  regulations  and  gave  an \nunconvincing  explanation  about  its  desire  to  lessen  the  burdens  on  smaller \ninstitutions. (Doc. 7-1 at 47–49).  \nRegardless of whether the court agrees with the agency’s “policy judgment,” \nPrometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423, the Department provided a reasoned \nexplanation  for  its  rule  change,  see  89  Fed. Reg.  at  33,733–34,  33,736–37.  In \n93 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 94 of 122\nparticular, the court notes that the Department acknowledged that at least one circuit \ncourt of appeals has held that public institutions “must allow for some form of live \nquestioning in front of the fact-finder,” Baum, 903 F.3d at 583, but it also explained \nthat  its  rule  allows  such  institutions  to  continue  providing  live  hearings  with \nadversarial cross-examination, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,737; see also id. at 33,895 (to \nbe codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(g)). The new regulation lowers the mandatory \nrequirements for grievance procedures but institutions may continue to use more \nstringent requirements if they choose. See id. at 33,895 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.46(g)). The Department’s new position is not “so implausible that it could not \nbe ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Ga. Dep’t of \nEduc., 883 F.3d at 1314 (quotation marks omitted).  \nAnd although the amended regulations represent a change in the Department’s \npolicy, the Supreme Court has rejected the view that “agency change [is] subjected \nto more searching review” than initial action. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \nat 514. Although an agency may not “depart from a prior policy sub silentio or \nsimply disregard rules that are still on the books,” an agency changing positions \n“need not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy \nare  better  than  the  reasons  for  the  old  one;  it  suffices  that  the  new  policy  is \npermissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency \nbelieves it to be better.” Id. at 515.  \n94 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 95 of 122\nPlaintiffs’ argument about the change to this part of the regulation is simply \nthat  the  Department’s  justification  was  not  sufficiently  detailed  in  light  of  the \nfinding, in 2020, that “the alternatives it now champions were problematic.” (Doc. \n7-1 at 48–49). But what they cite as findings are the following statements: (1) the \nDepartment’s “belie[f]” that the 2020 procedures “meet or exceed the due process \nrequired” under Supreme Court due process jurisprudence, 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,330; \n(2) the Department’s “agree[ment] with commenters that in too many instances” \nrecipients  “ha[d]  stifled  the  value  of  cross-examination,”  id.  at  30,313;  (3) the \nDepartment’s position that cross-examination “is as useful and powerful a truth-\nseeking tool for a complainant’s benefit as for a respondent,” id. at 30,330; and \n(4) the Department’s  “belie[f]  that  the  risks  of  allowing personal  confrontation \nbetween parties in sexual harassment cases outweigh the downsides of allowing \nadvisors to actively participate in the limited role of conducting cross-examination,” \nid. at 30,340. The Plaintiffs also cite another page from the Department’s discussion \nbut do not direct the court to any specific findings there. (See doc. 7-1 at 49); see \nalso 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,316.  \nIf  an  agency’s  position  were  considered  a  “finding”  requiring  “detailed \njustification” to change (see doc. 7-1 at 49), then every rule that changes an agency’s \npolicy would be subject to that more stringent review. But the Supreme Court has \nheld in the clearest possible terms that an “agency need not always provide a more \n95 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 96 of 122\ndetailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank \nslate.” Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs \nhave not cited any factual findings, as opposed to policy positions, that the amended \nregulations overturned. (See doc. 7-1 at 47–49); cf. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assoc. of \nthe  U.S.,  Inc.,  463 U.S.  at  35, 51  (finding  arbitrary  or  capricious  an  agency’s \nrescission of a regulation without addressing the agency’s previous finding that \nenactment of the regulation “could prevent approximately 12,000 deaths and over \n100,000 serious injuries annually”). Nor have they adequately explained why, if the \npolicy positions do count as findings, the Department’s rationale is not sufficiently \ndetailed. (See doc. 7-1 at 47–49).  \nAs described above, the Department provided a reasoned and reasonable \nexplanation for its change of position, and that is all the APA requires. See Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515. Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the elimination of a right to a \nlive hearing with adversarial cross-examination is arbitrary or capricious.  \niii. Single-Investigator Model \nPlaintiffs next challenge amended § 106.45(b)(2), which allows the same \nperson to function as Title IX coordinator, investigator, and decisionmaker. (Doc. 7-\n1 at 49–51). The parties and the court refer to this as the “single-investigator model.” \nPlaintiffs contend that this change “threatens to inject bias into the proceedings, \n96 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 97 of 122\nraises still more due-process concerns, and risks proceedings that result in sex \ndiscrimination.” (Id. at 50). Again, because Plaintiffs do not squarely challenge the \nconstitutionality  of  the  single-investigator  model,  the  court  disregards  their \nreferences to the “due-process concerns.”10 See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. at 516. \nThe current regulation provides that the decisionmaker cannot be the same \nperson as the Title IX Coordinator or the investigator. 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(7)(i). \nWhen it adopted this rule, the Department explained that it believed separation of \nthe rules “will not only increase the overall fairness of the grievance process but also \nwill increase the reliability of fact-finding and the accuracy of outcomes, as well as \nimprove party and public confidence in outcomes.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,367; see also \nid. 30,367–72 (continuing the discussion of comments for and against the prohibition \nof the single-investigator model). \n \n10 The court has nevertheless carefully read each of the cases Plaintiff cite (doc. 7-1 at 49–\n51) and finds those cases distinguishable. In one case, the court was concerned about the lack of \nlive hearing and adversarial cross-examination, not the use of a single-investigator model. Doe v. \nUniv. of Scis., 961 F.3d 203, 216 (3d Cir. 2020). In another, the court took issue with the appeal \nprocess because the appeals officer consulted with the adjudicator and was therefore not impartial. \nDoe v. Grinnell Coll., 473 F. Supp. 3d 909, 924 (S.D. Iowa 2019). In a third case, the court believed \n“[t]he dangers” of a single-investigator model “can be considerably mitigated if there is effective \nreview by a neutral party.” Doe v. Brandeis Univ., 177 F. Supp. 3d 561, 606 (D. Mass. 2016). But \nPlaintiffs here make no argument about the adequacy of the appeal process provided by the Final \nRule. The other cases Plaintiffs cite involve determinations made by decisionmakers who did not \nview the witnesses’ demeanors, see Doe v. Claremont McKenna Coll., 25 Cal. App. 5th 1055, \n1065, 1073 (Cal. Ct. App. 2018), or actual bias on the part of an investigator who also acted as a \ndecisionmaker, see Doe v. Miami Univ., 882 F.3d 579, 601 (6th Cir. 2018). These cases also do not \nestablish that the use of a single-investigator model is facially unconstitutional. \n97 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 98 of 122\nIn the 2022 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department noted that since \npassage of the current regulations, schools have indicated that the prohibition on the \nsingle-investigator model has been “burdensome for some schools in a way that \nundermined  these  schools’  ability  to  ensure  that  their  education  programs  or \nactivities are free from sex discrimination under Title IX, particularly those that are \nunder-resourced or that do not have a large number of staff.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,466–\n67. Schools also indicated that having multiple people involved in the investigation \nand decisionmaking process “results in a prolonged Title IX process, negatively \nimpacting the students who are participating in that process.” Id. at 41,467. Other \nrecipients expressed that when using the single-investigator model, “they saw more \nstudents seeking institutional support and resolution of complaints,” and for “small \nor under-resourced” recipients, involving multiple people “increases the likelihood \nof the parties having to interact with those employees in the regular course of their \nparticipation in the recipient’s education program or activity,” leading to students \nwho “changed majors or avoided courses, clubs and organizations, and athletic \nopportunities to avoid interacting with employees in those areas who had also \nadministered their grievance procedures related to sexual harassment allegations.” \nId.  In  light  of  these  concerns,  the  Department  proposed  allowing  the  single-\ninvestigator model “in conjunction with the other proposed measures designed to \nensure equitable treatment of the parties.” Id. \n98 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 99 of 122\nIn the Final Rule, the Department explained that allowing the use of the single-\ninvestigator model would answer the concerns schools had voiced about flexibility \nin  “structur[ing]  their  Title  IX  grievance  procedures  to  accommodate  each \ninstitution’s  unique  circumstances,”  including  the  “institution’s  administrative \nstructure, educational community, and applicable Federal and State case law and \nState or local legal requirements.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,662. The Department took the \nposition that the other procedural protections provided by the rule guarded against \nconflicts of interest, bias, and deprivation of due process. Id. at 33,663. It reiterated \nits belief that the single-investigator model “will relieve administrative burden[s] for \nsome recipients, especially smaller institutions, without sacrificing the quality and \nreliability of investigations or decisionmaking.” Id. And it rejected any suggestion \nthat allowing the single-investigator model would cause delays in the grievance \nprocess, noting that “commenters had varying views of which model . . . would \ncause more delay.” Id. at 33,664. Amended § 106.45(b)(2) therefore gave public \nschools the option, although not the requirement, to use a single-investigator model, \nso  long  as  “any  person  designated  as  a  Title  IX  Coordinator,  investigator,  or \ndecisionmaker not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or \nrespondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(2)). \n99 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 100 of 122\nPlaintiffs argue that the Department did not adequately explain its change \nfrom the Final Rule because the Department failed to explain its decision to abandon \nits own previous finding from the 2020 Rule. (Doc. 7-1 at 49–51). Again, the \nfindings it cites are not evidence-based factual findings, but instead the Department’s \nprevious belief about the best practice. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,367. Accordingly, all \nthe Department needed to do was show that the “new policy is permissible under the \nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, \nwhich  the  conscious  change  of  course  adequately  indicates.”  Fox  Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515. The Department provided a detailed explanation for \nits  decision  to  make  this  change.  89  Fed. Reg.  at  33,663.  In  particular,  the \nDepartment explained that it was allowing public schools the option to use a single-\ninvestigator  model  because  “the  single-investigator  model  supports  quality \ngrievance procedures and decision-making, and recipients expressed their belief that \nthe single-investigator model resulted in more students seeking institutional support \nand resolution of complaints.” Id. at 33,857 (incorporating 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,467). \nTo prevail on their request for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs needed to \nshow  a  substantial  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  their  claim  that  the \nDepartment lacked good reasons for the change allowing (but not requiring) public \nschools to use a single-investigator model. See Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176. Plaintiffs \ninstead argue that the Department’s policy judgment is poor. (See doc. 7-1 at 50–\n100 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 101 of 122\n51). But in reviewing the arbitrariness or capriciousness of agency action, the “court \nmay not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.” Prometheus \nRadio Project, 592 U.S. at 423. Plaintiffs have not carried their burden at the \npreliminary injunction stage.  \niv. Notice and Access to Evidence \nNext, Plaintiffs challenge the purported removal of a student’s right to inspect \nall the evidence against that student. (Doc. 7-1 at 51–52). They contend that the \nDepartment failed to provide a reasonable explanation for its decision to require \nstudents  to  request  access  to  the  evidence  instead  of  giving  them  access \nautomatically. (Id.). \nThe current regulation requires that both parties have the “opportunity to \ninspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly \nrelated to the allegations raised in a formal complaint, including the evidence upon \nwhich the recipient does not intend to rely in reaching a determination regarding \nresponsibility and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a \nparty or other source.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(5)(vi). It further requires that “[p]rior \nto completion of the investigative report, the recipient must send to each party and \nthe party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review.” Id.  \nUnder amended §§ 106.45 and 106.46, the school must “provide an equal \nopportunity to access either the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence, \n101 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 102 of 122\nor  an  accurate  description  of the  evidence,”  but  if  the  school  elects to give a \ndescription, “it must further provide the parties with an equal opportunity to access \nthe relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence upon the request of any \nparty.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,892 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(f)(4)(i)–(ii)); \naccord id. at 33,894 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(e)(6)).  \nThe Final Rule defines “relevant” evidence as “related to the allegations of \nsex discrimination under investigation as part of the grievance procedures under \n§ 106.45, and if applicable § 106.46. . . . [E]vidence is relevant when it may aid a \ndecisionmaker in determining whether alleged sex discrimination occurred.” Id. at \n33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). The Final Rule defines “impermissible” \nevidence as privileged evidence (unless there is waiver of the privilege), medical \nrecords “in connection with the provision of treatment” (unless the person provides \nwritten consent), and evidence of the complainant’s sexual interests or prior sexual \nconduct (unless offered to prove that someone else committed the alleged conduct \nor offered to prove consent). 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.45(b)(7)).  \nPlaintiffs contend that this rule impermissibly removes a student’s right to \ninspect “all the evidence against them” because if a school elects to provide a list, \nthe  student  “has  no  way  of  knowing  what  relevant  evidence  was  missing  (or \nincompletely summarized in) the report.” (Doc. 7-1 at 51–52). But Plaintiffs do not \n102 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 103 of 122\nacknowledge that the previous rule required a public school to provide an accused \nonly the evidence “directly related to the allegations raised in a formal complaint.” \n34  C.F.R.  § 106.45(b)(5)(vi).  Plaintiffs  have  made  no  attempt  to  explain  how \n“directly related” is different from “relevant and not otherwise impermissible.” (See \ndoc. 7-1 at 51–52). And in any event, the court notes that the Department addressed \nthe change at length in its response to comments. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,725–26. \nBecause Plaintiffs have not addressed the response to those comments, the court will \nnot either. On this briefing, Plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess  on  the  merits  of  their  claim  that  the  Department  acted  arbitrarily  or \ncapriciously  by  changing  the  rule  from  automatically  providing  all  evidence \n“directly related” to allowing recipients to provide “relevant and not otherwise \nimpermissible evidence” on request. \nv. Oral Complaints \nPlaintiffs also challenge the amendments to the regulations about grievance \nprocedures relating to the trigger for an investigation. Under the current regulation, \nthe grievance process for complaints of sexual harassment began “[u]pon receipt of \na formal complaint,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(2)(i), where a “formal complaint” was \ndefined as “a document filed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator \nalleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the recipient \ninvestigate  the  allegation  of  sexual  harassment,”  id.  § 106.30.  The  Final  Rule \n103 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 104 of 122\namends the definition of “complaint” to include “an oral or written request,” so that \nunder amended § 106.45(a)(2), an oral complaint of any type of sex discrimination \nmay initiate a grievance procedure. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,882 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.2); id. 33,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(a)(2)). And “when \nnotified of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under Title IX \nor this part,” the Title IX coordinator must, “[i]n the absence of a complaint or the \nwithdrawal of any or all of the allegations in a complaint, and in the absence or \ntermination  of  an  informal  resolution  process,  determine  whether  to  initiate  a \ncomplaint of sex discrimination that complies with the grievance procedures under \n§ 106.45, and if applicable § 106.46.” Id. at 33,889 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.44(f)(1)(v)).  \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  this  change  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  because  the \nDepartment “failed to reasonably address the extraordinary implications of these \nchanges or reasonably explain why a formal written complaint is unfair, impractical, \nor  unwise.”  (Doc.  7-1  at  52–53).  But  Plaintiffs  have  not  explained  what  the \n“extraordinary implications” of this change would be or why this court should \nsubstitute  its  judgment  about  fairness,  practicality,  or  wisdom  of  permitting \ninvestigations based on oral complaints instead of formal written complaints. (See \nid.). Nor have Plaintiffs addressed the Department’s detailed comments about its \nreasons for making this change. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,484–86, 33,591–92.  \n104 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 105 of 122\nIn  particular,  the  court  highlights  Plaintiffs’  failure  to  address  (1) the \nDepartment’s position that allowing a Title IX coordinator to initiate a complaint is \nconsistent with the 2020 Rule, which defined a “formal complaint” to be one “filed \nby  a  complainant  or  signed  by  the  Title  IX  Coordinator,”  34  C.F.R.  § 106.30 \n(emphasis added), and (2) the Department’s comments in the 2020 Rule that “the \nTitle IX Coordinator should have the discretion to initiate a grievance process,” 85 \nFed. Reg.  at  30,131,  and  “[w]hen  a  Title  IX  Coordinator  determines  that  an \ninvestigation is necessary even where the complainant (i.e., the person alleged to be \nthe victim) does not want such an investigation, the grievance process can proceed \nwithout  the  complainant’s  participation;  however,  the  complainant  will  still  be \ntreated as a party in such a grievance process,” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,131.  \nGiven Plaintiffs’ sparse argument about this part of the rule change, they have \nnot carried their burden of establishing a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their argument that the ability to initiate a grievance process based on an \noral  complaint  or  based  on  a  Title  IX  coordinator’s  discretion  is  arbitrary  or \ncapricious.  \nvi. Burden of Proof \nPlaintiffs’ next  challenge  to the new  grievance  procedures  relates  to  the \nburden of proof. (Doc. 7-1 at 53). Under the current regulations, institutions have \nthe option to use either a preponderance of the evidence standard or a clear and \n105 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 106 of 122\nconvincing evidence standard, so long as the institution uses “the same standard of \nevidence for formal complaints against students as for formal complaints against \nemployees, including faculty, and  . . . the same standard of evidence [for] all formal \ncomplaints of sexual harassment.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(1)(vii). Under amended \n§ 106.45, public schools must use a preponderance of evidence standard “unless the \nrecipient uses the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in all other \ncomparable  proceedings,  including  proceedings  relating  to  other  discrimination \ncomplaints, in which case the recipient may elect to use that standard of proof in \ndetermining whether sex discrimination occurred.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)). \nPlaintiffs contend that the change is arbitrary and capricious because the \nDepartment failed to define what a “comparable proceeding” is, making this a “de \nfacto ban on the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard without ever having to \njustify such a rule.” (Doc. 7-1 at 53) (alteration accepted). The commentary to the \nFinal  Rule  acknowledged  that  some  commenters  sought  clarification  on  the \ndefinition of “comparable proceedings.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,704. The Department \n“decline[d]  to  define  that  term”  because  “[t]here  are  many  different  types  of \ndisciplinary  proceedings,  which  may  vary  from  recipient  to  recipient,  and  the \nDepartment  does  not  want  to  enshrine  too  rigid  a  definition  of  ‘comparable \nproceedings’  in  the  regulatory  text  instead  of  leaving  determinations  of \n106 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 107 of 122\ncomparability  to  each  recipient’s  reasonable  discretion.”  Id.  at  33,704.  The \nDepartment,  however,  “clarifie[d]  that  it  generally  understands  and  intends \ncomparable proceedings to include, for example, allegations of similar types of \nperson-to-person (as distinct from recipient-to-person) offenses that are physical in \nnature and not based on sex.” Id. The Department indicated that “allegations of non-\nsexual physical violence” would be comparable to “allegations of sexual violence.” \nId. But, according to the Department, proceedings against faculty or staff would not \nbe considered comparable to proceedings against students. See id. at 33,705. \nWhether Plaintiffs have carried their burden of establishing that this rule \nchange is arbitrary or capricious is closer than in the other rule changes relating to \ngrievance procedures. Section 106.45(h)(1)’s language is not entirely clear about \nwhat constitutes a “comparable proceeding.” Id. at 33,893 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)). Some commenters pointed out this lack of clarity. Id. at \n33,704.  The  Department  acknowledged  those  commenters  and  provided  some \nexplanation about what it considers a “comparable proceeding,” although it is not \nclear to the court that the language of the new § 106.45(h)(1) actually reflects the \nDepartment’s understanding. Compare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,704–06, with id. at 33,893 \n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)).  \nHowever, Plaintiffs have cited no authority in support of their contention that \nthe lack of clarity makes the rule arbitrary or capricious. (See doc. 7-1 at 53). And \n107 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 108 of 122\nin similar circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit has declined to address a party’s \nargument that an ambiguous regulation was arbitrary and capricious. See Nat’l \nMining Ass’n, 985 F.3d at 1326 n.15 (“Petitioners’ initial brief refers in cursory \nmanner to an argument that, because the challenged terms are grievously ambiguous, \nthe Final Rule is rendered arbitrary and capricious. We do not think this argument is \nfairly  raised; petitioners  cite  no case  law supporting the  claim that  ambiguous \nprovisions in a regulation can render that regulation arbitrary and capricious.”). The \nburden is on Plaintiffs to show their entitlement to the extraordinary relief they seek. \nSee Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176. And their argument is limited to pointing out the lack \nof definition of “comparable proceeding” and a conclusory statement that the lack \nof  definition  makes  this  a  “de  facto  ban  on  the  clear-and-convincing-evidence \nstandard.” (Doc. 7-1 at 53) (alteration accepted). The court cannot find a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits of the claim based on that sparse argument. \nvii. Cumulative Effect  \nPlaintiffs’ last argument is that the changes to the grievance procedures are \narbitrary or capricious because the Department failed to consider the cumulative \neffect of the changes.  (Id. at 54–55; doc. 52 at 33–34). Plaintiffs do not address that \nalmost all of the changes made by the Final Rule are optional and they do not address \nhow the mandatory changes, considered cumulatively, make the Final Rule arbitrary \nor capricious. (See doc. 7-1 at 54–55; doc. 52 at 33–34). They have not sufficiently \n108 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 109 of 122\nraised this issue for the court to find that they have a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits.  \n3.  Imminent Irreparable Harm \nEven if Plaintiffs could establish a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits,  a  preliminary  injunction  is  appropriate  only  if  they  can  establish  that \n“irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues.” Wreal, LLC v. \nAmazon.com, LLC, 840 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016); see also Siegel, 234 F.3d \nat 1176. The irreparable harm must be “imminent”: “the very idea of a preliminary \ninjunction  is  premised  on  the  need  for  speedy  and  urgent  action  to  protect  a \nplaintiff’s rights before a case can be resolved on its merits.” Wreal, LLC, 840 F.3d \nat 1248 (quotation marks omitted). “[T]he asserted irreparable injury must be neither \nremote  nor  speculative,  but  actual  and  imminent.”  Siegel,  234  F.3d  at  1176 \n(quotation marks omitted). \nPlaintiffs assert that they will suffer irreparable harm because (1) some parts \nof the Final Rule conflict with policies and statutes enacted by the States; (2) the \nStates will incur significant costs in complying with the new regulations and they \ncannot  recover  money  damages  for  those  compliance  costs  because  of  the \ngovernment’s sovereign immunity; and (3) members of the Private Plaintiffs will \nsuffer chilled speech and loss of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. (Doc. \n7-1 at 55–56; see also doc. 52 at 35). At the hearing, Plaintiffs stated that their \n109 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 110 of 122\ncompliance cost injuries are occurring now, and that their other injuries will occur \non August 1, the effective date of the Final Rule, but not before. (See doc. 52 at 8). \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not acted with urgency in this case thus \nfar. They filed the complaint on April 29, 2024, the same day the Final Rule became \nfinal. (Doc. 1); 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,474. The case was initially assigned to a magistrate \njudge. Plaintiffs served the Department three days later, on May 2, 2024, and filed \nthe motion for a preliminary injunction six days after that, on May 8, 2024. (Docs. \n6, 7). The next day (May 9, 2024), the parties jointly proposed a six-week briefing \nschedule, giving the Department until June 5, 2024 to file a response brief and \nPlaintiffs until June 19, 2024 to file a reply brief. (Doc. 13). The parties requested \nthat, if the court “deem[ed] it necessary,” they could make oral arguments in the first \nweek of July 2024. (Id.).  \nOn  May  13,  2024,  the  magistrate  judge  reassigned  this  case  to  the \nundersigned.  (Docs.  16,  17).  The  next  day,  the  court  entered  the  agreed-upon \nbriefing schedule and, in an attempt to expedite the submission date of the motion, \nset oral argument for June 26, 2024. (Doc. 18). At Plaintiffs’ request, and upon the \nrepresentation that the parties intended to rest on their briefs, the court delayed the \nhearing until July 1, 2024. (See doc. 20; see also doc. 52 at 3–4).  \n“A delay in seeking a preliminary injunction of even only a few months—\nthough not necessarily fatal—militates against a finding of irreparable harm.” Wreal, \n110 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 111 of 122\nLLC, 840 F.3d at 1248. Although Plaintiffs here did not delay for months, they did \nset  a  leisurely  seven-and-a-half-week  schedule  to  bring  this  motion  under \nsubmission. As the Eleventh Circuit has held, this delay is “not . . . fatal,” but it does \ncall into question the true exigency of their request. See id. \nThe court further highlights that Plaintiffs have not argued they will suffer an \nimmediate irreparable injury from the revocation of funding if they fail to comply \nwith the new regulations. (See doc. 7-1 at 55–56; doc. 52 at 34–35). Even if they \nhad, Title IX sets out a detailed scheme for compliance actions. See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1682. Termination of funding can occur only after a hearing, a finding of failure \nto comply, advising “the appropriate person or persons” of the failure to comply, \ndetermining  that  “compliance  cannot be secured by  voluntary  means,”  filing  a \nwritten report with the relevant House and Senate committees, and passage of thirty \ndays after the filing of such a report. Id. Accordingly, denial of funding is not \nimminent and cannot support a finding of irreparable injury at this stage. \nFinally, it has come to this court’s attention that another district court has \nstayed the effective date of the rule in a number of schools across the country. See \nKansas, no. 24-4041, doc. 53. That order affects multiple schools in the States. See \nid., doc. 67-1. Although Plaintiffs notified the court that this district court had \ngranted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, they did not disclose the \nimpact on schools within the States. (See doc. 50). Those schools could not suffer \n111 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 112 of 122\nany irreparable harm from this court’s denial of an injunction because the Final Rule \nis already enjoined as to those schools.  \nTurning  to  the  arguments  Plaintiffs  did  make,  the  court  begins  with  the \nconstitutional injuries the private organizations assert their members will suffer, then \nturns  to  the  preemptive  effect  of  the  Final  Rule,  before  addressing  the  non-\nreimbursable compliance costs. The court emphasizes at the outset that the only \nevidence  Plaintiffs  submit  in  support  of  their  assertion  of  irreparable  harm  is \naffidavits listing state statutes Plaintiffs allege are incompatible with parts of the \nFinal Rule, affidavits stating, in the most general terms, that compliance “will be \ncostly,” and citations to the Final Rule’s estimations about the nationwide cost to \nschools of complying with the amended regulations. (Doc. 7-1 at 55–56). The court \nhas doubts that this evidence is sufficient to show the irreparable harm is imminent \nsuch that the court should grant relief to Plaintiffs before a final adjudication on the \nmerits. \na.  Constitutional Injuries \nPlaintiffs assert, in one sentence, that the members of Private Plaintiffs face \nirreparable injury “in the form of chilled speech and the loss of their First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights.” (Doc. 7-1 at 56; see also doc. 52 at 35). This single \nsentence, with no accompanying argument, is insufficient to carry the burden of \n“clearly establish[ing]” an imminent and irreparable injury. See Siegel, 234 F.3d at \n112 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 113 of 122\n1176. Accordingly, Private Plaintiffs’ arguments fail simply on the basis that they \nare inadequately presented.  \nBut  even  if  the  court  considers  these  arguments,  they  fail. As the  court \ndescribed in the substantive discussion of Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs do not clearly \nargue, much less show, a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a claim \nthat any part of the Final Rule is likely to facially violate the First or Fourteenth \nAmendment rights of students. (See doc. 7-1 at 14–54). And Plaintiffs’ reliance on \nCartwright—which noted that an ongoing violation of the First Amendment always \nconstitutes an irreparable injury sufficient to support a preliminary injunction—is \nunavailing. (Id. at 56); Cartwright, 32 F.4th at 1128. \nIn Cartwright, the Eleventh Circuit held that the district court abused its \ndiscretion in refusing to preliminarily enjoin the enforcement of a specific existing \ndiscriminatory harassment policy after deciding that the policy likely violated the \nFirst Amendment. (Doc. 7-1 at 56) (citing Cartwright, 32 F.4th at 1128). But here, \nPlaintiffs have not carried their initial burden of substantial likelihood of success \nthat their constitutional rights likely will be violated, so the court likewise cannot \nconclude that Plaintiffs have demonstrated an irreparable injury.  \nb.  Preemptive Effect of the Final Rule \nNext, Plaintiffs contend that the States face irreparable injury because the \nFinal Rule contains a “preemption provision” that will affect their ability to enforce \n113 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 114 of 122\ntheir own laws. (Doc. 7-1 at 55). The Final Rule amends 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(b) to \nprovide that “[t]he obligation to comply with Title IX and this part is not obviated \nor alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that conflicts with Title \nIX or this part.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)). Each \nState points to state laws that they say conflict with parts of the Final Rule.  \nFirst, the States argue they will suffer immediate irreparable injury from being \nunable to enforce their state laws about sex-separation in sports. (Doc. 7-1 at 55; see \nalso doc. 7-2 ¶ 14; doc. 7-3 ¶ 9; doc. 7-4 ¶ 8; doc. 7-10 ¶ 10). But sports regulations \nare not before the court, and the Final Rule plainly permits such sex separation. See \n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,888 (indicating no change to 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.41(b)). To the extent the States contend that the Final Rule will \neventually lead to the destruction of sex-separation in sports, they have not carried \ntheir burden of showing that this destruction is imminent such that it can support a \nrequest for immediate injunctive relief. Accordingly, the States have not shown an \nirreparable injury from being unable to enforce their state laws about sex-separation \nin sports.  \nThe court observes that South Carolina does not cite any other state statute \nthat conflicts with the Final Rule. (See doc. 7-1 at 55; doc. 7-10 ¶ 10). Accordingly, \nSouth Carolina has not established any irreparable injury from the preemptive effect \n114 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 115 of 122\nof the Final Rule. The court’s analysis therefore will proceed only as to Alabama, \nGeorgia, and Florida. \nIn support of its contention about irreparable injury, Georgia cites an affidavit \nfrom its State Superintendent of Education, who states that the Final Rule “conflicts \nwith Georgia laws that govern K-12 institutions. See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. § 20-2-\n786 (Parents’ Bill of Rights).” (Doc. 7-1 at 55; doc. 7-8 ¶ 9). It is not immediately \napparent what part of § 20-2-786 conflicts with the Final Rule, and the citation, \nwithout further explanation, does not assist the court in making that determination. \nThe court declines to make Plaintiffs’ argument about the effect of this state statute \nfor them. See Fils, 647 F.3d at 1284 (“To prevail on a particular theory of liability, \na party must present that argument to the district court. Our adversarial system \nrequires it; district courts cannot concoct or resurrect arguments neither made nor \nadvanced by the parties.”) (citation omitted). Accordingly, Georgia has not shown \nan irreparable injury based on a conflict between § 20-2-786 and the Final Rule.  \nThat leaves Alabama and Florida, each of which cites specific state statutes \nthat they argue conflict with the Final Rule. None of the statutes cited relate in any \nway to the amended grievance procedures (34 C.F.R. §§ 106.46(g), 106.45(b)(2), \n106.45(f), and 106.45(h)(1)). (See doc. 7-1 at 55; doc. 7-2 ¶ 14; doc. 7-3 ¶ 9; doc. 7-\n4 ¶ 8). Accordingly, Alabama and Florida have not shown an irreparable injury \n115 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 116 of 122\narising from any conflict between their state laws and the new grievance procedures \nchallenged in that part of the case. \nHowever,  Alabama  and  Florida  do  highlight  state  laws  relating  to  sex-\nseparated bathrooms at school, parents’ rights to information about their children, \nand the definition of harassment at school. (See doc. 7-1 at 55; doc. 7-2 ¶ 14; doc. 7-\n3 ¶ 9; doc. 7-4 ¶ 8). The court therefore turns to whether Alabama and Florida have \nshown an irreparable injury for the Final Rule’s changes  relating to bathrooms and \nparental rights, and the definition of harassment.  \nAs discussed at length already, Plaintiffs claim § 106.10 “redefin[es]” the \nword “sex” to include “gender identity,” focusing on how this definition will affect \nschools’  regulation  of  sex-separated  bathrooms  and  parental  rights  to  access \ninformation about children. (See doc. 1 ¶¶ 162–189; doc. 7-1 at 20–35).  \nAlabama points to two of its state laws: one requiring that public K-12 schools \nmandate  “every  multiple  occupancy  restroom  or  changing  area  designated  for \nstudent use to be used by individuals based on their biological sex,” Ala. Code § 16-\n1-54(b) (2022), and one prohibiting school employees at public or private schools \nfrom “[e]ncourag[ing] or coerc[ing] a minor to withhold from the minor’s parent or \nlegal guardian the fact that the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex is \ninconsistent with the minor’s sex” or “[w]ithhold[ing] from a minor’s parent or legal \nguardian information related to a minor’s perception that his or her gender or sex is \n116 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 117 of 122\ninconsistent with his or her sex,” Ala. Code § 26-26-5 (2022). (Doc. 7-1 at 55; doc. \n7-3 ¶ 9). Florida points to its “Safety in Private Spaces Act.” (Doc. 7-4 ¶ 8; see doc. \n7-1 at 55). As best the court can determine, that act requires educational institutions \nto establish disciplinary procedures for students who willfully enter restrooms or \nchanging facilities designated for the opposite sex and refuse to leave when asked to \ndo so by authorized personnel. Fla. Stat. § 553.865(9) (2024).  \nTo start, it is not clear that Alabama Code § 26-26-5 conflicts with any part of \nthe Final Rule. That statute prohibits school employees from (1) encouraging a \nminor to withhold information about the minor’s perception about his or her gender \nidentity  from  his  or  her  parents  and  (2) withholding  from  a  minor’s  parents \ninformation about the minor’s perception about his or her gender identity. Ala. Code \n§ 26-26-5. Alabama provides no argument about what part of the Final Rule conflicts \nwith this statute. (See doc. 7-1 at 55).  \nElsewhere in its brief, Plaintiffs maintain that, in response to the proposed \nrules, the Department “concede[d] that the rule can require such results” thereby \ninfringing on parental rights. (Doc. 7-1 at 35). But the part of the Final Rule cited \nexplicitly states that Title IX and the regulations do not displace a parent’s right to \nact on their child’s behalf and that the final regulations do not “prevent[ ] a recipient \nfrom disclosing information about a minor child to their parent who has the legal \nright to receive disclosures on behalf of their child” or “restrict[ ] any right of a \n117 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 118 of 122\nparent to act on behalf of a minor child or require[ ] withholding of information \nabout a minor child from their parents.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821–22.  \nIndeed, amended § 106.6(g) provides that “[n]othing in Title IX or this part \nmay be read in derogation of any legal right of a parent, guardian, or other authorized \nlegal representative to act on behalf of a complainant, respondent, or other person, \nsubject to paragraph (e) of this section.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885. Amended § 106.6(e) \nin turn provides that “[t]he obligation to comply with Title IX and this part is not \nobviated or alleviated by FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, or its implementing regulations, \n34 CFR part 99.” Id. The court assumes that this is what Plaintiffs rely on, but \nPlaintiffs have not explained what part of the Final Rule conflicts with FERPA. (See \ndoc. 7-1 at 35). Instead, they contend that the Department “decline[d] to opine” on \nthe questions whether parents would lose parental rights. (Id. at 35). But the part of \nthe regulations they quote for that proposition was actually “declin[ing] to opine on \nhow § 106.31(a)(2) interacts or conflicts with specific State laws because it would \nrequire  a  fact-specific  analysis.”  89  Fed. Reg.  at  33,822.  That  declination  has \nnothing  to  do  with  any  conflict  with  FERPA  or  any  obligation  to  withhold \ninformation from parents. In short, Plaintiffs have not shown how the Final Rule \nconflicts with Alabama Code § 26-26-5. As a result, they have not shown any \nirreparable injury from any such conflict. \n118 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 119 of 122\nThe  court  does,  however,  agree  that  Alabama  Code  § 16-1-54(b)  (the \nbathroom statute) and Florida’s Safety in Private Spaces Act appear to conflict with \n§ 106.31(a)(2)’s instruction that preventing a person from participating in a program \nor activity consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects the person to more \nthan a de minimis harm, when considered in connection with § 106.33’s permission \nfor public schools to provide sex-separated bathrooms. See Ala. Code § 16-1-54(b); \nFla.  Stat.  § 553.865(9);  89  Fed. Reg.  at  33,887  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.31(a)(2)); 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. The court must therefore address whether that \nconflict would impose an irreparable injury on Alabama and Florida.  \nThose States argue that they will be irreparably harmed because some parts of \nthe Final Rule are unlawful and would preempt the state statutes, infringing on state \nsovereignty. (Doc. 7-1 at 55). In other words, their argument about irreparable injury \ndepends on the success of their merits argument. (See id.). This court has already \ndetermined that Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their argument that the relevant parts of the Final Rule are unlawful. \nAccordingly, they also have not shown an irreparable injury from the inability to \nenforce their own laws based on the enactment of an unlawful regulation. \nThe court notes that the Department argues that it, not Plaintiffs, would be \nirreparably harmed by an injunction because it has an interest in administering the \nFinal Rule. (Doc. 24 at 63–64). The Department cites a case about injunctions of \n119 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 120 of 122\n“statutes enacted by representatives of [the] people.” (Id.) (citing Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). But the Final Rule is not a \nstatute  and  congressional  representatives  did  not  enact  it.  Accordingly,  the \nDepartment’s argument is unpersuasive.  \nBut the Department does not have to make persuasive arguments regarding its \nasserted injury because the burden is on Plaintiffs to show their entitlement to relief, \nnot on the Department to show Plaintiffs’ lack of entitlement to relief. See Siegel, \n234 F.3d at 1176; see also Canal Auth. of Fla., 489 F.2d at 573. And Plaintiffs’ \narguments regarding irreparable injury fail because these arguments depend on the \nsuccess on their challenge to the Final Rule. Plaintiffs have not shown that they will \nsuffer an irreparable injury based on any asserted conflict between the Final Rule \nand state law. \nPlaintiffs also challenge the redefinition of “sexual harassment.” (Doc. 1 \n¶¶ 190–206). The only State that cites a state law conflicting with the Final Rule’s \ndefinition  of  “harassment”  is  Alabama.  (See  doc.  7-1  at  55;  doc.  7-1  ¶ 14). \nAccordingly,  Florida,  Georgia,  and  South  Carolina  have  not  established  an \nirreparable injury based on any conflict between the Final Rule and state law.  \nAlabama  points  to  its  state  law  requiring  “public  institutions  of  higher \nlearning” to “prohibit harassment in a manner consistent with the definition provided \nin this chapter, and no more expansively than provided herein.” (Doc. 7-2 ¶ 14). The \n120 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 58   Filed 07/30/24   Page 121 of 122\nchapter defines “harassment” as “[e]xpression that is so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies access to an educational opportunity \nor benefit provided by the public institution of higher education.” Ala. Code § 16-\n68-2(4) (2019). The court agrees that § 106.2’s definition of sex-based “[h]ostile \nenvironment  harassment”  conflicts  with  Alabama’s  definition  of  “harassment.” \nCompare id., with 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2).  \nBut Alabama’s assertion of irreparable harm nevertheless fails. Alabama’s \nonly argument is that the rule is unlawful, so allowing it to preempt state laws would \ninflict an irreparable harm (Doc. 7-1 at 55). But Alabama has not made a showing \nof substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its challenge to the definition of \nsex-based “[h]ostile environment harassment.” Accordingly, its claim of irreparable \ninjury likewise fails. \nc.  Compliance Costs \nNext, the States argue that they will suffer immediate irreparable injuries if \nthey incur compliance costs in connection with the Final Rule because they will not \nbe able to recoup those costs when the rules are invalidated. (Doc. 7-1 at 56). They \noffer no evidence of what the compliance costs will be. (Id. at 55–56). Moreover, \nlike their argument about conflicting state laws, their assertion of irreparable injury \nfrom  the  expenditure  of  compliance  costs  depends  on  the  argument  that  the \nregulation will be held invalid.

OF ALABAMA\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nWESTERN DIVISION \n \nSTATE OF ALABAMA, et al.,    ] \n              ] \n  Plaintiffs,          ] \n              ] \nv.              ]           \n              ]     7:24-cv-533-ACA \nMIGUEL CARDONA, in his official   ] \ncapacity as the U.S. Secretary of     ] \nEducation, et al.,          ] \n              ] \n  Defendants.         ] \n   \nORDER \n  Earlier today, this court denied a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by \nPlaintiffs (States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, the Independent \nWomen’s  Law  Center,  Independent  Women’s  Network,  Parents  Defending \nEducation, and Speech First, Inc.). (Doc. 58). Plaintiffs now move for an injunction \npending appeal, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d) and Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 8(a)(1), or alternatively an administrative stay. (Doc. 63). The \ncourt DENIES the motion. \n  With respect to the motion for an injunction pending appeal, Rule 62 permits \nthe court to “grant an injunction on terms . . . that secure the opposing party’s rights” \nwhile the other party appeals the court’s order that “refuse[d] . . . an injunction.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(d). Rule 8 provides that “[a] party must ordinarily move first in \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 64   Filed 07/30/24   Page 2 of 5\nthe district court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending \nappeal.” The factors a court must consider are: “(1) whether the stay applicant has \nmade a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \napplicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where \nthe  public  interest  lies.”  Nken  v.  Holder,  556  U.S.  418,  434  (2009);  see  also \nTouchston v. McDermott, 234 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). Plaintiffs \nargue that a stay is warranted because of the reasons they gave in their motion for a \npreliminary injunction, and because this court misapplied Adams ex rel. Kasper v. \nSchool Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc), and \nSpeech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110 (11th Cir. 2022). (Doc. 63 at 2). \nBecause this court has already rejected Plaintiffs’ substantive arguments, the court \nconcludes that a stay pending appeal for those reasons is not warranted. \n  With respect to the administrative stay, Plaintiffs cite a concurring opinion \nfrom a Supreme Court decision refusing to vacate an administrative stay that the \nFifth Circuit entered while it decided whether to enter an injunction pending appeal. \n(See doc. 63 at 3) (citing United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797 (2024) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring in denial of applications to vacate stay)). Justice Barrett, concurring in \nthe denial of applications to vacate the stay, explained the history and purpose of \nadministrative stays in the Supreme Court and the federal appellate courts. See id. at \n2 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 64   Filed 07/30/24   Page 3 of 5\n798–99. In particular, Justice Barrett stressed that an administrative stay is meant to \n“permit time for briefing and deliberation” on whether to grant an injunction pending \nappeal. Id. at 798. Nothing in her opinion indicates that it is appropriate for a district \ncourt to enter an administrative stay while an appellate court decides whether to enter \nan injunction pending appeal. It seems more appropriate for the appellate court to \nenter an administrative stay if it believes that it needs additional time for briefing \nand deliberation. \n  Plaintiffs also cite Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092 (11th Cir. \n2004) to support their contention that this court can enter an administrative stay \nwhile the Eleventh Circuit decides whether to enter an injunction pending appeal. \n(Doc. 63 at 3). The Klay decision held that a court may grant an injunction under the \nAll Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), without consideration for “[t]he requirements \nfor a traditional injunction . . . because a court’s traditional power to protect its \njurisdiction, codified by the Act, is grounded in entirely separate concerns.” 376 F.3d \nat 1100. But the Klay decision also held that “[t]he All Writs Act is a residual source \nof authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute \nspecifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All \nWrits Act, that is controlling.” Id. (quotation marks omitted).  \nAs Plaintiffs pointed out in their motion for a preliminary injunction, there is \na statutory basis for relief in 5 U.S.C. § 705, which permits “the reviewing court, \n3 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 64   Filed 07/30/24   Page 4 of 5\nincluding the court to which a case may be taken on appeal from or on application \nfor  certiorari  or  other  writ  to  a  reviewing  court,  [to]  issue  all  necessary  and \nappropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve \nstatus or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” But Plaintiffs have \noffered no argument—either in their motion for a preliminary injunction or their \nemergency  motion  for  a  stay  pending  appeal—about  what  standard  to  use  in \nevaluating a request for a stay under § 705.  \nAnd the Supreme Court has recently held that “[w]hen Congress empowers \ncourts to grant equitable relief, there is a strong presumption that courts will exercise \nthat authority in a manner consistent with traditional principles of equity.” Starbucks \nCorp. v. McKinney, 144 S. Ct. 1570, 1576 (2024); see also United States v. Texas, \n599 U.S. 670, 700 (2023) (“[Section] 705 . . . might just confirm courts’ authority to \nissue traditional equitable relief pending judicial review.”) (Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin the judgment). The Eleventh Circuit has also emphasized that where a statute \npermitting equitable relief is silent about the standard to apply, “it implicitly requires \nthat the traditional requirements for an injunction be met in addition to any elements \nexplicitly specified in the statute.” Klay, 376 F.3d at 1098; see id. at 1099 (“[I]f \nCongress desired to make such an abrupt departure from traditional equity practice \nas is suggested, it would have made its desire plain.”) (quoting Hecht Co v. Bowles, \n321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944)). As the court explained above, Plaintiffs’ arguments in \n4 \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 64   Filed 07/30/24   Page 5 of 5\ntheir motion for an adminsitrative stay merely repeat their arguments in their motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, and therefore do not warrant issuing a stay pending \nappeal. \nThe court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion. \nDONE and ORDERED this July 30, 2024. \n \n \n \n      _________________________________ \n      ANNEMARIE CARNEY AXON \n      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n5 ",

Docket No. 7:24-cv-00533-ACA \n____________________ \n \nBefore WILSON, BRANCH, and LUCK, Circuit Judges. \nBY THE COURT: \nOn  April  29,  2024,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education \npromulgated a new administrative rule “interpreting” Title IX to \nbreak new ground in the 52-year history of that landmark statute.  \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs \nor Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. \n33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106).  The rule \nrepresents a sea change to the regulations administering Title IX \nby, among other things, expanding the definition of discrimination \non the “basis of sex” to include discrimination based on gender \nidentity—as well as materially altering and expanding the scope of \nTitle IX’s sexual-harassment-related regulations.  \nBefore this action, every court to consider the issue across \nthe  nation—seven  district  courts  and  two  courts  of  appeals1— \n \n1 Notably, since filing the instant appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the \nDepartment’s request for a partial stay of court orders in two separate district \ncourts—which both preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rule in the \nrespective plaintiffs’ states—pending resolution of the appeals of those orders \n \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 3 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 3 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  3 \npreliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rule.2  The district court \nhere, by contrast, refused to enjoin the rule a day before it was \nsupposed to go into effect. \n \nin the Fifth and Sixth Circuits.    Dep’t of Educ. v. Louisiana, 603 U.S. ___, 2024 \nWL 3841071 (2024).  The Court held that “all Members of the Court today \naccept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to \nthree provisions of the rule, including the central provision that newly defines \nsex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation \nand gender identity.” Id. at *1. Four members of the Court dissented as to the \nscope of the injunction, arguing that the three provisions could be severed \nfrom the rule while leaving the rest of the rule intact.  Id. at *2–*5 (Sotomayor, \nJ., dissenting). However, the majority held that a rule-wide injunction was \nappropriate, reasoning that “[o]n this limited record and in its emergency \napplications, the Government has not provided this Court a sufficient basis to \ndisturb the lower courts’ interim conclusions that the three provisions found \nlikely to be unlawful are intertwined with and affect other provisions of the \nrule.”  Id. at *1.   \nPuzzlingly, the dissent argues that the Louisiana Court “did not address the \nmerits” or “analyze the parties’ merits arguments,” but instead “addressed \nonly severability.”  As noted previously, the Court unanimously “accept[ed] \nthat the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to three \nprovisions of the rule.” Id. at *1; see also id. at *2 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) \n(“Every Member of the Court agrees respondents are entitled to interim relief \nas to three provisions of that Rule.”).  And by accepting that the plaintiffs were \nentitled to preliminary injunctive relief, the Court had to have found that all \nthe requirements for a preliminary injunction were met, including likelihood \nof success on the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of the equities.   \n2 See Tennessee v. Cardona, No. 24-5588, 2024 WL 3453880 (6th Cir.

Background \nA. Title IX \nTitle IX, enacted in 1972, mandates that, subject to certain \nexceptions: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  .  .  .  .” 20  U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a).  “[Title  IX’s]  purpose,  as  derived  from  its  text,  is  to \nprohibit sex discrimination in education.” See Adams ex rel. Kasper v. \nSch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 816–17 (11th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc). \nThrough an appropriation from Congress, the Department \nprovides states with federal funds for education.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  \nAnd the Department can terminate or refuse to grant federal funds \nto schools that fail to comply with the statute.   Id.  Schools can also \nbe held liable through private lawsuits.  See Davis v. Monroe Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640–41 (1999) (recognizing an implied \nprivate  right  of  action  against  schools  under  Title  IX).    The \nDepartment  is  also  tasked  with  “issuing  rules,  regulations,  or \norders  of  general  applicability  which  shall  be  consistent  with \nachievement of the objectives of the statute. . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  \nAfter  Title  IX’s  enactment  in  1972,  implementing \nregulations  were  adopted,  permitting  separation  based  on \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 6 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 6 of 29 \n6  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nbiological sex in restrooms, locker rooms, and showers, as well as \nin sports.  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms  and  Activities  Receiving  or  Benefiting  from  Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 45 C.F.R. § 86.33 (1974) (“the 1974 Rule”) \n(restrooms, locker rooms, showers); id. § 86.41 (athletics).  \nB.  Regulatory Provisions at Issue \nOn April 29, 2024, the Department implemented the final \nrule  at  issue  here,  which  adds  one  new  regulation  and  alters \ntwenty-five existing regulations.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,882–96. \nPlaintiffs focus on “three central provisions” of the rule that they \nargue are unlawful.   \nFirst, they challenge 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, which broadens \nTitle IX’s general ban on discrimination “on the basis of sex,” to \ninclude “discrimination on the basis of . . . gender identity.”  34 \nC.F.R. § 106.10. \nSecond,  and  relatedly,  Plaintiffs  challenge  §  106.31(a)(2), \nwhich states that, even in limited circumstances in which Title IX \n“permits different treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a \nrecipient must not carry out such different treatment or separation \n. . . [that] subject[s] a person to more than de minimis harm[.]”3  Id. \n \n3 The regulation, however, exempts certain statutory carveouts—such as 20 \nU.S.C. § 1686, which permits schools to “maintain[] separate living facilities \nfor the different sexes”—from the de minimis harm requirement (i.e., schools \ncan provide different treatment or separation on the basis of sex in these \nsituations regardless of whether it causes more than de minimis harm).  But \n \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 7 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 7 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  7 \n§  106.31(a)(2).    The  provision  then  states  that  a  policy  that \n“prevents a person from participating in an education program or \nactivity consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a \nperson to more than de minimis harm . . . .”  Id.  \nAnd  third,  Plaintiffs  challenge  §  106.2,  which  adopts  a \nbroader standard of sex-based harassment.  Rather than covering \nschools that are “deliberately indifferent” to sexual harassment \nthat, “based on the totality of the circumstances,” is so “severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive” that it “denies” education, the \nrule  now  eliminates  the  deliberate  indifference  language  and \ncovers sexual harassment that is “so severe or pervasive” that it \n“limits or denies” education. Compare §§ 106.30, 106.44(a) (effective \nuntil  July  31,  2024),  with  §§  106.2  (emphasis  added),  106.44 \n(effective August 1, 2024).4  The rule further explains that \n[s]ex-based  harassment,  including  harassment \npredicated on sex stereotyping or gender identity, is \ncovered by Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, \nsubjectively and objectively oﬀensive, and suﬃciently \nsevere or pervasive to limit or deny a student’s ability \nto  participate  in  or  beneﬁt  from  a  recipient’s \n \nthese  statutory  carveouts  do  not  include  the  Department’s  previous \nregulations on separate bathrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, access to \nclasses and activities, and appearance codes.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816. \n4 Below, Plaintiffs also challenged the rule’s grievance procedures, which they \nargued “repeal protections for the accused, like the right to a live hearing with \ncross-examination and the right to not have a single official investigate, \nadjudicate, and punish.”  However, Plaintiffs’ objections to these procedures \n“aren’t the focus of this motion.”   \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 8 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 8 of 29 \n8  Order of the Court  24-12444 \neducation program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile \nenvironment).  Thus, harassing a student—including \nacts  of  verbal,  nonverbal,  or  physical  aggression, \nintimidation,  or  hostility  based  on  the  student’s \nnonconformity  with  stereotypical  notions  of \nmasculinity and femininity or gender identity—can \nconstitute discrimination on the basis of sex under \nTitle IX in certain circumstances. \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516. \nFinally, the rule provides that it preempts all “State or local \nlaws or other requirements” that conflict with its terms, 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,885, and it applies to any school “program or activity” \nregardless of whether the activity occurs within the school.  Id. at \n33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.11).  \nII.  Discussion \nIn support of their motion for an injunction pending appeal, \nPlaintiffs argue that they have shown a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, and that the other factors necessary for such \nrelief—irreparable harm, balance of equities, and public interest—\nalso weigh in favor of granting their motion.  They also argue that \nbecause  the  provisions  they  argue  are  unlawful  are  central \nprovisions of the rule, the provisions are not severable and so we \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 9 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 9 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  9 \nshould enjoin the entirety of the rule at this stage.  Each of these \narguments will be addressed in turn.5 \nA. Injunction Pending Appeal \nFor us to grant the extraordinary remedy of an injunction \npending appeal, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) \n[that] irreparable injury will be suﬀered unless the \ninjunction issues; (3) [that] the threatened injury to \nthe  movant  outweighs  whatever  damage  the \nproposed injunction may cause the opposing party; \nand (4) [that,] if issued, the injunction would not be \nadverse to the public interest. \nCallahan v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 939 F.3d 1251, 1257 \n(11th Cir. 2019) (quotation omitted).  We will address Plaintiffs’ \nability to meet each of these four elements in turn.    \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe first factor we review in determining whether to grant \nan injunction pending appeal is whether Plaintiffs have shown “a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits.”  Id.; see Gonzales v. \nGovernor of Ga., 978 F.3d 1266, 1271 n.12 (11th Cir. 2020) (noting \n \n5 The district court, in addition to holding that Plaintiffs failed to meet the \ntraditional  factors  for  injunctive  relief,  suggested  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to \nsupport key issues with arguments and citation to authority.  Based on our \nreview of the record, we are unpersuaded at this stage that Plaintiffs failed to \nadvance and support the key claims they make here.  We therefore proceed to \nthe traditional factors for issuing an injunction pending appeal. \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 10 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 10 of 29 \n10  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nthat likelihood of success on the merits is “generally the most \nimportant of the four factors” (quotation omitted)).  Because we \nreview a district court’s ruling on a preliminary injunction “under \nthe deferential abuse of discretion standard,” Robinson v. Atty. Gen., \n957 F.3d 1171, 1177 (11th Cir. 2020), the question we must answer \nis whether “it is substantially likely that [Plaintiffs] can demonstrate \nthe district court abused its discretion when it denied the motion \nfor a preliminary injunction,” Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. \nServs., 19 F.4th 1271, 1286 (11th Cir. 2021).  And our evaluation of \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ challenge is governed by the Administrative \nProcedure Act, which requires us to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, . . . otherwise not in accordance with law . . . [or] in \nexcess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C).  \nFinally,  we  note  that  in  ruling on  a  motion for  a  preliminary \ninjunction,  “we  do  not  conclusively  resolve  the  merits  of  the \n[underlying] appeal.”  Robinson, 957 F.3d at 1177.  Rather, “[t]he \nchief function of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status \nquo until the merits of the controversy can be fully and fairly \nadjudicated.”  Id. at 1178 (quotation omitted). \na .   Sections 106.10  & 106.31(a)(2) \nPlaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits \non appeal because § 106.10 broadens sex to include gender identity \nin  violation  of  Adams,  and  combines  with  § 106.31(a)(2)  to \nunlawfully  “ban[]  schools  from  requiring  students  to  use  the \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 11 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 11 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  11 \nbathroom of their sex, rather than their gender identity.”  We agree \nthat Plaintiffs have made the requisite showing.   \nIn Adams, we addressed, among other matters, whether a \nFlorida school’s policy of separating male and female bathrooms \non the basis of sex violated Title IX.  57 F.4th at 796, 811–17.  To \nanswer  this  question,  we  “interpret[ed]  the  word  ‘sex’  in  the \ncontext of Title IX and its implementing regulations.”  Id. at 811.  \nWe began by considering dictionary definitions of the word “sex” \nat  the  time  of  Title  IX’s  enactment  in  1972,  which \n“overwhelming[ly]”  defined  sex  “on  the  basis  of  biology  and \nreproductive function[.]”  Id. at 812.  We then determined that \ndefining “sex” in Title IX to include “gender identity” “ignored the \noverall statutory scheme” because it would render Title IX’s many \nsex-based  exceptions  meaningless  and  “would  provide  more \nprotection against discrimination on the basis of transgender status \nunder the statute and its implementing regulations than it would \nagainst discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id. at 813–14.  We thus \ndetermined that defining “sex” to include “gender identity” “could \nnot comport with the plain meaning of ‘sex’ at the time of Title IX’s \nenactment  and  the  purpose  of  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulations, as derived from their text.”  Id. at 814.  Accordingly, \nwe held that the term “sex” in Title IX “unambiguously” referred \nto  “biological  sex”  and  not  “gender  identity.”    Id.  at  814–15.  \nMoreover, we held that “[e]ven if the term ‘sex,’ as used in Title IX, \nwere unclear,” because Title IX was passed under the Spending \nClause,  the  statute  needed  to  incorporate  gender  identity \n“unambiguously,” which we held it did not.  Id. at 815–17.   \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 12 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 12 of 29 \n12  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nGiven  our  holding  in  Adams  that  “sex”  in  Title  IX \n“unambiguously”  refers  to  “biological  sex”  and  not  “gender \nidentity,” it is certainly highly likely that the Department’s new \nregulation defining discrimination “on the basis of sex” to include \n“gender identity” is contrary to law and “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2); see Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, \n144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266, 2273 (2024) (holding that “[c]ourts must \nexercise  their  independent  judgment  in  deciding  whether  an \nagency  has  acted  within  its  statutory  authority”  regardless  of \nwhether a statute is ambiguous, and that statutes “have a single, \nbest meaning”). And the Department even acknowledges that the \nrule is contrary to Adams, but “declines to adopt” our reasoning.  \nSee  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33820–21.  Thus,  the  Plaintiffs  have \ndemonstrated a substantial likelihood that the district court abused \nits  discretion  in  denying  Plaintiffs’  preliminary  injunction  as  it \nrelates to their challenges to §§ 106.10 and 106.31(a)(2).  See Brown \nv.  Ala.  Dep’t  of  Transp.,  597  F.3d  1160,  1185  (11th  Cir.  2010) \n(“Although the grant [or denial] of . . . injunctive relief is generally \nreviewed for an abuse of discretion, if the trial court misapplies the \nlaw we will review and correct the error without deference to that \ncourt’s determination.” (quotation omitted)). \nThe  Department  disagrees,  arguing  that  defining \ndiscrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  in  Title  IX  is  merely  a \nstraightforward application of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  The Department \nmisreads Bostock and our precedent.  In Bostock, the Supreme Court \nwas clear that “[t]he question [wa]sn’t just what ‘sex’ mean[s], but \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 13 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 13 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  13 \nwhat Title VII says about it,” that its decision did not “sweep \nbeyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex \ndiscrimination,” and that it did not “purport to address bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  590 U.S. at 681.  And \nin Adams, we noted that Bostock did not govern Title IX because it \n“involved employment discrimination under Title VII,” while Title \nIX  “is  about  schools  and  children—and  the  school  is  not  the \nworkplace.” 57 F.4th at 808; see also Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of \nEduc., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005) (“Title VII . . . is a vastly different \nstatute from Title IX . . . .”).  Additionally, we noted that “Title IX, \nunlike Title VII, includes express statutory and regulatory carve-\nouts for differentiating between the sexes.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 811. \nThus, if Bostock applied, it “would swallow the carve-outs and \nrender  them  meaningless.”  Id.  at  814  n.7.    We  subsequently \nreaffirmed, in Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, that “Bostock \nrelied  exclusively  on  the  specific  text  of  Title  VII”  and  “bears \nminimal relevance” to cases involving “a different law . . . and a \ndifferent factual context.”  80 F.4th 1205, 1228–29 (11th Cir. 2023).  \nSo Bostock does not undermine our conclusion that the Plaintiffs \nhave shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to \nthis  claim.    Plaintiffs  have  thus  satisfied  the  first  (and  most \nimportant)  factor  for  obtaining  preliminary  injunctive  relief.  \nAccord Arkansas, 2024 WL 3518588, at *14–17; Oklahoma, 2024 WL \n3609109, at *4–6; Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *8–11; Tennessee, \n2024 WL 3453880, at *2–4; Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *10–12; \nTexas, 2024 WL 3405342, at *5–7; Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at \n*8–13. \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 14 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 14 of 29 \n14  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nb .   Section 106.2 \nNext,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  “[t]he  rule’s  redefinition  of \nharassment in § 106.2 is likely illegal,” because it is inconsistent \nwith  the  definition  the  Supreme  Court  set  out  in  Davis,  and \nconflicts with our First Amendment precedent in Speech First, Inc. \nv. Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110 (11th Cir. 2022).   \nIn Davis, the Supreme Court defined what “discrimination” \nmeant in the context of a private damages lawsuit under Title IX \nagainst a school board, in which one student alleged that another \nstudent  had  sexually  harassed  her.    526  U.S.  at  632–33.    The \nSupreme Court held that, student-on-student “sexual harassment” \nwas “discrimination” for purposes of Title IX, and in order for a \nprivate  plaintiff  to  bring  a  suit  for  damages  for  such \n“discrimination,” the behavior must be “so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to \neducation that Title IX is designed to protect,” and the recipient \nmust be “deliberately indifferent.”  Id. at 650–52.   \nSection  106.2’s  new  definition  of  discrimination—which, \nrecall,  includes  conduct  that,  “based  on  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances . . . is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a \nperson’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s \neducation program or activity”—flies in the face of Davis.6  See § \n \n6 The Department argues that, in the Title VII context, courts have applied a \nbroader “severe or pervasive” standard than the standard set out in Davis \n“without raising any First Amendment concerns.”  That cases have adopted a \n \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 15 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 15 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  15 \n106.2 (emphasis added).  And while the Department points out that \nDavis arose  in  the  context  of  a  private  lawsuit  rather  than  an \nadministrative  lawsuit,  the  Supreme  Court  was  nonetheless \ninterpreting the same word in the same statute to address the same \nlegal question: the meaning of “discrimination” under Title IX.  It \nis not clear why a different, and significantly broader, definition of \n“discrimination” would apply in the administrative context.  See \nLoper Bright Enters., 144 S. Ct. at 2266 (noting that statutes “do—in \nfact, must—have a single best meaning”); Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 380 (2005) (“It is not at all unusual to give a statute’s \nambiguous language a limiting construction called for by one of \nthe  statute’s  applications,  even  though  other  of  the  statute’s \napplications,  standing  alone,  would  not  support  the  same \nlimitation.  The lowest common denominator, as it were, must \ngovern.”). \nAnd  the  new  definition  also  raises  First  Amendment \nconcerns.  Indeed, the Davis majority, in responding to the dissent’s \nconcerns  that  holding  schools  liable  for  student-on-student \nconduct might force them to enact policies that violated the First \nAmendment,  pointed  to  the  “very  real  limitations”  in  its \ndefinition—noting that the standard did not include liability for \n \nbroader standard in the Title VII context does not undermine the holding in \nDavis.  Indeed, the Department’s argument overlooks the very different \ncontexts in which Title IX and Title VII apply.  See Davis, 526 U.S. at 651 \n(“Courts, moreover, must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adult \nworkplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be \nunacceptable among adults.”). \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 16 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 16 of 29 \n16  Order of the Court  24-12444 \n“teas[ing],” “name-calling,” isolated incidents, or “a mere ‘decline \nin grades.’”  Davis, 526 U.S. at 652.  And it warned against courts \n“impos[ing] more sweeping liability than we read Title IX to require.” \nId. (emphasis added).   \nTo that end, in Speech First, Inc., we addressed, in pertinent \npart,  whether  a  college’s  “discriminatory  harassment”  policy \n“likely” violated the First Amendment for purposes of obtaining a \npreliminary injunction.  32 F.4th at 1113.  Among other things, the \npolicy  prohibited  students  from  “engaging  in,”  “[c]ondoning,” \n“encouraging,”  or  “failing  to  intervene”  in  “verbal,  physical, \nelectronic  or  other  conduct”  that  touched  on  many  different \ncharacteristics of a person including, for example, “gender identity \nor expression.”  Id. at 1114–15.  The policy also prohibited “Hostile \nEnvironment Harassment,” which it defined as “[d]iscriminatory \nharassment  that  is  so  severe  or  pervasive  that  it \nunreasonably interferes with, limits, deprives, or alters the terms or \nconditions of education . . . employment . . . or participation in a \nuniversity program or activity . . . .” Id. (emphasis added).  And the \npolicy stated that a hostile environment could be created by “a \nsingle or isolated incident, if sufficiently severe,” and would be \nevaluated based on “the totality of known circumstances.”  Id.  We \nheld that this policy likely violated the First Amendment because it \n“restrict[ed] political advocacy and cover[ed] substantially more \nspeech than the First Amendment permit[ted],” thereby chilling \nprotected speech, and it was also likely “an impermissible content- \nand  viewpoint-based  restriction.”    Id.  at  1125–27.    Here,  the \nDepartment’s new definition of “discrimination” is similar in its \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 17 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 17 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  17 \nsweep to the “discriminatory harassment” policy in Cartwright, and \nthus raises similar First Amendment concerns.  \nUltimately, the Department’s  regulation contravenes the \nSupreme Court’s construction of Title IX “discrimination” set out \nin Davis and runs headlong into the First Amendment concerns \nanimating decisions like Davis and Cartwright.  Accordingly, it is \nhighly likely that the Department’s regulation is contrary to law \nand “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Thus, \nPlaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed in showing that the \ndistrict court abused its discretion in not granting a preliminary \ninjunction  as  it  relates  to  § 106.2.    Accord  Arkansas,  2024  WL \n3518588, at *17–18; Oklahoma, 2024 WL 3609109, at *7–8; Louisiana, \n2024 WL 2978786, at *12; see also Brown, 597 F.3d at 1185. \n2.  Other Factors \nThe  other  factors—irreparable  injury,  balance  of  the \nequities, and public interest—also favor Plaintiffs.  Beginning with \nirreparable injury, Plaintiffs suffer at least three harms if the rule \ngoes into effect while we resolve the merits of their appeal.  First, \nthey  face  unrecoverable  compliance  costs  in  meeting  the \nregulatory burdens imposed by the rule, lest they lose billions of \ndollars in federal funding for not complying.  See Georgia v. President \nof the United States, 46 F.4th 1283, 1302 (11th Cir. 2022) (stating that \n“unrecoverable monetary loss is an irreparable harm”); W. Va. ex \nrel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1149 (11th \nCir.  2023)  (noting  that  “money  damages  cannot  adequately \ncompensate the States because the federal government generally \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 18 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 18 of 29 \n18  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nenjoys immunity from suit”).7  Indeed, representatives from each \nof the States submitted declarations stating that the schools faced \nsubstantial compliance costs in the form of time and money if the \nrule went into effect; and these costs would be doubled if the \nregulations  are  ultimately  invalidated  and  the  States  have  to \nreimplement their previous policies.  See Georgia, 46 F.4th at 1302 \n(noting that costs included “time and effort” needed to comply \nwith the rule). And the Department acknowledged the rule would \nlead to increased compliance costs.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,861, \n33,851, 33,548.  \nSecond,  four  of  the  Plaintiffs  are  States  that  have  laws \ngoverning public institutions of education that would conflict with \nthe rule and would thus be unenforceable.8  See Abbott v. Perez, 585 \n \n7 The dissent argues that the compliance costs are not irreparable because the \nStates could recover damages for their expenditures if the rule was later \ninvalidated.  But the dissent does not specify whom the States could sue to \ncollect these damages.  If the dissent is suggesting that the States could collect \nfrom the federal government, that argument is foreclosed by our precedent.  \nSee W. Va. ex rel., 59 F.4th at 1149 (noting that “money damages cannot \nadequately compensate the States because the federal government generally \nenjoys immunity from suit”).   \n8 The dissent argues that the States “assert[] without explanation that the Rule \nconflicts with state statutes.”  But far from conclusory statements, each of the \nStates submitted affidavits that cite examples of specific state statutes that \nwould conflict with the rule.  Indeed, as the district court noted, “Alabama \nCode § 16-1-54(b) (the bathroom statute) and Florida’s Safety in Private Spaces \nAct appear to conflict with § 106.31(a)(2)’s instruction that preventing a person \nfrom participating in a program or activity consistent with the person’s gender \nidentity subjects the person to more than a de minimis harm . . . .”  \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 19 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 19 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  19 \nU.S.  579,  602  n.17  (2018)  (“[T]he  inability  to  enforce  its  duly \nenacted  plans  clearly  inflicts  irreparable  harm  on  the  State.”); \nMaryland  v.  King,  567  U.S.  1301,  1303  (2012)  (Roberts,  J.,  in \nchambers)  (“[A]ny  time  a  State  is  enjoined  by  a  court  from \neffectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it \nsuffers a form of irreparable injury.” (quotation omitted)).9   \nAnd third, irreparable harm flows to the private plaintiffs \nfrom the First Amendment concerns raised by the rule.10   See Elrod \nv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (“[t]he loss of First Amendment \nfreedoms,  for  even  minimal  periods  of  time,  unquestionably \nconstitutes irreparable injury.”).    \n \n9 The Department cites State of Florida v. Department of Health and Human \nServices, 19 F.4th 1271, 1291 (11th Cir. 2021), for the proposition that “it is \nblack-letter law that the federal government does not invade[ ] areas of state \nsovereignty simply because it exercises its authority in a way that preempts \nconflicting state laws.”  But that statement was made after we had already \ndecided that the rule at issue in that case was likely lawfully enacted.  Id. at \n1286–90.  Thus, that case says nothing about whether a state faces irreparable \nharm from having to forsake enforcement of their own laws in favor of a \nregulation that is likely unlawful.  \n10 The dissent argues that the States “assert[] without explanation that the Rule \n. . . requires schools to adopt harassment policies that chill student speech.”  \nBut as discussed supra pp. 15–17, the States raise legitimate First Amendment \nconcerns supported by argument and authority.     \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 20 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 20 of 29 \n20  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nAdditionally, the balance of the equities and public interest \nfavor Plaintiffs.11  As to the balance of the equities, the Department \nhas interpreted “sex” in Title IX to mean biological sex and has \nallowed schools to have separate bathrooms based on biological \nsex for five decades. See, e.g., The 1974 Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 86.33.  A \npreliminary injunction pending appeal maintains that longstanding \nstatus quo.  Robinson, 957 F.3d at 1178 (“The chief function of a \npreliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until the merits \nof the controversy can be fully and fairly adjudicated.” (quotation \nomitted)); see also Oklahoma, 2024 WL 3609109, at *12 (“Since the \ncurrent regulations have been in effect for decades, there is little \nharm in maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this \nsuit.”).   \nOn the other hand, as noted above, Plaintiffs face substantial \ncompliance costs if the new rule goes into place and they are \ndeprived of the enforcement of their existing policies and laws in \nthe meantime.  That balance shakes out in favor of the Plaintiffs.  \nAnd as to the public interest, the public has no interest in enforcing \na  regulation  that  likely  violates  the  APA  and  raises  First \nAmendment concerns.  See Otto v. City of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, \n870 (11th Cir. 2020) (“It is clear that neither the government nor \n \n11 “Where the government is the party opposing the preliminary injunction, \nits interest and harm—the third and fourth elements—merge with the public \ninterest.”  Florida, 19 F.4th at 1293.   \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 21 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 21 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  21 \nthe  public  has  any  legitimate  interest  in  enforcing  an \nunconstitutional ordinance.”).12 \nB.  Scope of the Injunction \nPlaintiffs argue that “the injunction should bar Defendants \nfrom enforcing the rule in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South \nCarolina” and that it should “extend to the whole rule, at least for \nnow.”  The Department argues that only the challenged provisions \nshould be enjoined. \nWe agree with Plaintiffs and every federal court (including \nthe Supreme Court) to rule on this issue that a rule-wide injunction \nin the Plaintiff States is called for at this stage.  As the Sixth Circuit \nreasoned, the three provisions that Plaintiffs challenge are “central \nprovisions” that “appear to touch every substantive provision of \nthe  Rule,”  and  the  Department  “never  contemplate[d] \n \n12  The  dissent’s  analysis  of  the  equities  is  singularly  focused,  arguing \nhyperbolically that enjoining the rule “harms all students who face sex-based \ndiscrimination.”  Notwithstanding that the injunction would leave in place the \nnumerous sex-based protections from the former rule, the dissent does not \neven attempt to grapple with the potential harms caused by leaving the rule \nin place.  Indeed, the dissent makes no mention of the privacy rights of \nbiological males and females who have to use restrooms with members of the \nopposite biological sex. See Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns \nCnty., 57 F.4th 791, 804 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (“The protection of students’ \nprivacy interests in using the bathroom away from the opposite sex and in \nshielding  their  bodies  from  the  opposite  sex  is  obviously  an  important \ngovernmental objective.”)  Nor does the dissent discuss the harm flowing from \nthe likely loss of First Amendment speech rights.  See Cartwright, 32 F.4th at \n1125–27. \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 22 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 22 of 29 \n22  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nenforcement of the [r]ule without any of the core provisions.”  \nTennessee, 2024 WL 3453880, at *3–4 (emphasis in original); accord \nOklahoma, 2024 WL 3609109, at *12 (explaining why enjoining the \nnew rule in its entirety is appropriate); Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, \nat *18 (same); Arkansas, 2024 WL 3518588, at *20–*22 (same); see \nalso, e.g., Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 262 (2006) (“To sever \nprovisions to avoid constitutional objection here would require us \nto write words into the statute . . . , or to leave gaping loopholes . . \n.  ,  or  to  foresee  which  of  many  different  possible  ways  the \nlegislature might respond to the constitutional objections we have \nfound.”).  And the Supreme Court agreed with the Sixth Circuit \nthat  it  was  not  clear  “which  particular  provisions,  if  any,  are \nsufficiently independent of the enjoined definitional provision and \nthus might be able to remain in effect.” Louisiana, 2024 WL 3841071 \nat *3.   \nMoreover,  the  Sixth  Circuit’s  points  on  the  practical \nconcerns  accompanying  a  partial  injunction  here  are  also  well \ntaken.  The court noted that “it is hard to see how all of the schools \ncovered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new \nobligations if the Rule’s definition of sex discrimination remains \nenjoined,” and it questioned “how the schools could properly train \ntheir teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with so little \ntime before the start of the new school year.” Tennessee, 2024 WL \n3453880, at *4. Similarly, we find persuasive the Fifth Circuit’s \nreasoning that anything less than a rule-wide injunction “would \ninvolve this court in making predictions without record support \nfrom  the  [Department]  about  the  interrelated  effects  of  the \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 23 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 23 of 29 \n24-12444   Order of the Court  23 \nremainder  of  the  Rule  on  thousands  of  covered  educational \nentities,” and that this lack of guidance is especially damning given \n“the historical purpose of a preliminary injunction . . . is to maintain \nthe status quo pending litigation.”  Louisiana, 2024 WL 3452887, at \n*2.  \nThe Department argues that the severability provisions in \nthe new rule foreclose a rule-wide injunction where, as here, only \nindividual provisions are likely unlawful.  Each subpart (A through \nF) of the rule has its own severability provision stating that “[i]f any \nprovision of this subpart or its application to any person, act, or \npractice  is  held  invalid,  the  remainder  of  the  subpart  or  the \napplication of its provisions to any person, act, or practice shall not \nbe affected thereby.”  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.9.  These provisions \nsay nothing about the situation we face here, where provisions in \nmultiple  different  subparts  may  well  be  invalidated \nsimultaneously.13    The  difficulty  with  severing  the  relevant \nprovisions is further underscored here because, as the Sixth Circuit \nreasoned, the Department “did not contemplate enforcement of \nthe Rule without any of the core provisions.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL \n3453880, at *4.   \nFor these reasons, we grant Plaintiffs’ request for a rule-wide \ninjunction pending appeal in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South \nCarolina.  In granting injunctive relief, we maintain the status quo \nalong  with  every  other  federal  court  (including  the  Supreme \n \n13 Section 106.2 is included in subpart A, § 106.10 is included in subpart B, and \n§ 106.31 is included in subpart D. \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 24 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 24 of 29 \n24  Order of the Court  24-12444 \nCourt) to rule on this issue.  More specific questions about scope \ncan be answered at a later stage.  \n* * * \nFor  all  the  reasons  discussed,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for \nInjunction Pending Appeal is GRANTED.

The Department of Education is “authorized \nand directed to effectuate to the provisions” of Title IX, and may \ndo so by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability \nwhich shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the \nstatute.”  Id. at § 1682.  Consistent with its statutory directive, the \nDepartment  promulgated  an  administrative  rule  entitled \n“Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance,” 89 Fed. Reg. \n33474 (Apr. 29, 2024).   \nPlaintiffs—Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and \nfour private organizations—filed suit to block enforcement of the \nRule, which was set to take effect on August 1, 2024.  In a thorough \nand well-reasoned 109-page opinion, the district court denied their \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  On the same day, it denied \ntheir  emergency  motion  for  injunction  pending  appeal  or \nadministrative injunction.  Before this court, Plaintiffs moved for \nan  administrative  injunction,  which  we  granted  to  allow  for \nfulsome review on the merits.  The Department is administratively \nenjoined from enforcement, and Plaintiffs now seek an injunction \npending appeal.  \n \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 26 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 26 of 29 \n2  WILSON, J., Dissenting  24-12444 \nAn injunction pending appeal is an “extraordinary remedy,” \nTouchston v. McDermott, 234 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 2000), which \n“requires the exercise of our judicial discretion,” Democratic Exec. \nComm. of Fla. v. Lee, 915 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir 2019).  We are \nunable  to  grant  this  drastic  remedy  unless  Plaintiffs  clearly \nestablish: “(1) a substantial likelihood that they will prevail on the \nmerits of the appeal; (2) a substantial risk of irreparable injury . . . \nunless the injunction is granted; (3) no substantial harm to other \ninterested  persons;  and  (4)  no  harm  to  the  public  interest.”  \nTouchston, 234 F.3d at 1132.  In evaluating whether Plaintiffs meet \ntheir heavy burden, we are directed to “examine the district court’s \ndecision  to  deny  a  preliminary  injunction  for  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion.”  State of Fla. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 F.4th \n1271, 1279 (11th Cir. 2021). \nThe district court rejected Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction \nmotion,  finding  no  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  and \nindependently, an insufficient showing of irreparable harm.  But \nthis court need not reach the merits to resolve this appeal; instead, \nwe are directed to reject Plaintiffs’ motion for injunction pending \nappeal because they have still not shown irreparable injury.1  See \nSiegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1175–76 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc).   \n \n1  The  Supreme  Court  did  not  address  the  merits  when  it  denied  the \nDepartment’s motion for stay in this case’s companions—filed in district \ncourts in the Fifth and Sixth Circuits.  Dep’t of Educ. v. Louisiana, 603 U.S. ___, \n2024 WL 3841071 (2024).  It addressed only severability and did not analyze \nthe parties’ merits arguments.

As  an  initial  matter,  they  make  only  a \nconclusory statement—both before the district court and here—\nthat  they  have  suffered  sovereign  and  constitutional  harms, \nasserting without explanation that the Rule conflicts with state \nstatutes and requires schools to adopt harassment policies that chill \nstudent speech.  This is insufficient to meet their heavy burden of \n“clearly establishing” an imminent and irreparable injury.  See id. at \n1176. \nTurning to compliance harms, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule \nimposes  regulatory  burdens  on  schools  that  damages  cannot \ncompensate.  Namely, they assert that schools will require time \nand money to review the Rule, conform their poilicies to the Rule, \napprove these policies, train employees, and litigate.  While this \ncircuit  has  recognized  that  unrecoverable  monetary  loss  can \namount to irreparable harm, Odebrecht Constr., Inc. v. Sec’y, Fla. \nDep’t of Transp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1289 (11th Cir. 2013), “[t]he key \nword in this consideration is irreparable,” Sampson v. Murray, 415 \nU.S. 61, 90 (1974) (emphasis added and internal quotation omitted).  \nAn  injury  is  only  irreparable  “if  it  cannot  be  undone  through \nmonetary remedies.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n of Gen. Contractors of \nAm. v.

This court does not doubt that there will be compliance costs \nassociated  with  implementing  the  Rule,  but  Plaintiffs  fail  to \nsubstantiate their claim that damages could not compensate them \nfor their expenditures.  At bottom, nothing in the record supports \na finding of irreparable injury.  \nMoreover, the remaining injunction factors strongly favor a \ndenial of Plaintiffs’ motion.  See Touchston, 234 F.3d at 1132; see also \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 23–26 (2008).  The \nchallenged provisions largely pertain to transgender students, who \nremain at risk of substantial harm in the face of discrimination the \nRule aims to eliminate.  And enjoining the Rule as a whole—which \nincludes other provisions not challenged here and independent \nfrom Plaintiffs’ gender-identity-based concerns2—certainly harms \nthe  public  because  it  harms  all  students  who  face  sex-based \ndiscrimination.   \nIt bears repeating that the remedy Plaintiffs seek is not to be \ngranted unless they clearly establish their burden of persuasion as \n \n2    In  its  application  for  a  partial  stay  before  the  Supreme  Court,  the \nDepartment of Justice explains that “[m]ost of the Rule does not address \ngender identity.”  For example, it strengthens protections for postpartum \nstudents  and  employees  by  requiring  lactation  spaces  and  reasonable \nmodifications for pregnant students.  \n \n\nCase 7:24-cv-00533-ACA   Document 73   Filed 08/23/24   Page 29 of 29\nUSCA11 Case: 24-12444     Document: 47-2     Date Filed: 08/22/2024     Page: 29 of 29 \n24-12444   WILSON, J., Dissenting  5 \nto each prerequisite.  See Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176; see also Touchston, \n234 F.3d at 1132.  They have not provided us with a sufficient basis \nto disturb the district court’s conclusion that they failed to sustain \ntheir burden, and I dissent from the majority’s lack of discretion in \ngranting  this  “extraordinary  and  drastic”  remedy  in  Plaintiffs’ \nfavor.  See Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176. \n \n ",
