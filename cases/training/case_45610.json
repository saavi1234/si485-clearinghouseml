    "summary": "<p>In this case, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho challenged the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s regulation (the &ldquo;Rule&rdquo;) which interpreted Title IX&rsquo;s definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination against gender identity, expanded the definition of harassment, and incorporated a de minimis harm standard for determining sex discrimination. The Rule went into effect on August 1, 2024, but has been enjoined from enforcement in several states due to this case and <em><a href=\"../../../../case/45612/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tennessee v. Cardona</a></em>, a similar case brought by states Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, 2024, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, represented by the Defense of Freedom Institute as well as their own Attorneys General, filed suit in the Western District of Louisiana against the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), its component agency the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and officers of each. Plaintiffs brought suit under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1681&ndash;88, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 553, 701&ndash;06. They alleged that the Rule was a substantive and procedural violation of the APA as promulgated under Title IX. They also alleged that Congress violated the Spending Clause and Article I, &sect; 1 of the Constitution in delegating the powers to issue the Rule through Title IX. The states sought declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge Terry A Doughty and Magistrate Judge Kayla D McClusky.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding as parties 17 school boards across Louisiana. On May 15, 2024, Judge Terry A. Doughty ordered the case consolidated with <em><a href=\"../../../../case/45772/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapides Parish School Board v. U.S. Department of Education</a>, </em>another suit challenging the Rule, brought by Rapides, a Louisiana school board not already party to this case. Rapides was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2024, plaintiffs requested a stay postponing the Rule&rsquo;s effective date of August 1, 2024, or alternatively a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the rule. Fifteen other states and the District of Columbia filed amici curiae in opposition to the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for preliminary relief on June 12, 2024. The court granted the preliminary injunction on June 13, 2024, enjoining the enforcement of the Rule in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, stating that abuses of power by federal agencies are threats to democracy. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims 1) that the Rule's interpretation of \"sex discrimination\" contradicted Title IX, 2) that the Rule's harassment standard contradicted Title IX and violated the First Amendment, and 3) that the Rule violated the major questions doctrine by enacting a significant policy without congressional authorization.</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2024, the Government moved for a partial stay of the injunction pending appeal, arguing that the injunction was overbroad and that the Rule was severable, and appealed the preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The partial stay sought to allow all enforcement of the Rule except 34 C.F.R. &sect; 106.31(a)(2), which identified practices that prevent a person from participating in activities consistent with their gender identity as discrimination, and the definition of &ldquo;hostile environment harassment&rdquo; within 34 C.F.R. &sect; 106.2. The district court denied the partial stay on July 11, 2024, holding that the Rule was enjoined on the basis of more than the two provisions identified by the Government, and that the provisions were not severable.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, on July 1, 2024, the Government requested an emergency partial stay from the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit denied the partial stay 2-1 on July 17, 2024. The Government also requested an emergency partial stay of this preliminary injunction and a stay of a similar injunction in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/45612/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tennessee v. Cardona</a></em> from the Supreme Court on July 22, 2024. The Supreme Court denied both stays on August 16, 2024. Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by Justices Gorsuch, Kagan, and Jackson, arguing that the portion of the Rule about sex discrimination was severable and therefore the partial stay should be granted.</p>\r\n<p>As of October 2, 2024, the appeal in the Fifth Circuit remains pending.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Garland, in his official capacity as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States (collectively, “Defendants”) for declaratory and injunctive relief and allege as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This week, the U.S. Department of Education—by the stroke of a pen and over 400 \nFederal Register pages drafted in Washington, D.C. conference rooms—published new Title IX \nregulations intended to transform the classrooms, lunchrooms, bathrooms, and locker rooms of \nAmerican schools. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106) (the “Rule” \nor “Final Rule”), Ex. A. There is normal federal government overreach—and then there is the Final \nRule: a naked attempt to strong-arm our schools into molding our children in the current federal \ngovernment’s preferred image of how a child should think, act, and speak. The Final Rule is an affront \nto the dignity of families and school administrators everywhere, and it is nowhere close to legal. \n2.  Title  IX  prohibits  educational  institutions  that  receive  federal  funding  from \ndiscriminating on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities. That prohibition promotes \nequal opportunity, dignity, and respect for both sexes—while at the same time recognizing (as both \nTitle IX and longstanding regulations recognize) that equality and dignity occasionally demand \ndifferentiation between the two sexes to promote respect for both. Such differentiation is not unlawful \ndiscrimination: It furthers the precise goals, and protects the precise values, that undergird Title IX. \n2   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 4 of 54 PageID #:  515\n \nAnd over the past 50 years, that basic understanding has driven remarkable progress and countless \nopportunities—in particular for women and girls—in American education. \n3.  The Final Rule drives a dagger through the heart of Title IX’s mandate. The central \nfeature of the Final Rule is the Department’s extraordinary move to transform Title IX’s prohibition \nof discrimination based on “sex” to include discrimination based on “gender identity”—a wildly \nambiguous term that itself is never fully defined in the Final Rule but that the Department describes \nas a student’s subjective and internal “sense” of his or her gender. And based on that key move, the \nDepartment sets out to remake our educational system and our children. \n4.   To take just a few examples: The Final Rule prohibits single-sex bathrooms and locker \nrooms. The Final Rule likewise compels school officials both to use pronouns associated with a \nstudent’s claimed “gender identity” and to force students to do so as well. And school officials should \nbe careful about requesting documentation to verify the sincerity of a person’s claimed gender identity, \nthe Department ominously warns, because that itself might violate the Final Rule. Moreover, although \nthe Department tries to downplay the Rule’s impact on athletics—because the Department knows \nthat extending its radical theory to athletics would be political suicide in an election year—the Rule \ncannot help but sound the death knell for female sports. \n5.  The consequences will be shocking and severe. Boys and girls will be forced to share \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and perhaps even lodging on overnight field trips with members of the \nopposite sex. Adding insult to injury, they will be forced to use “preferred pronouns” or else face \npunishment, which raises distinct Free Speech and Free Exercise problems. And that’s just the \nstudents. Consider parents who, for example, may never hear about so-called “gender affirming” \ncounseling that their children receive because the Final Rule allowed a school to conceal that \ninformation. Consider also teachers and other school administrators who will be forced to create and \ncarry out employee training programs on the 423-page Rule, change school policies, and likely begin \n3   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 5 of 54 PageID #:  516\n \ncostly construction projects to modify school bathrooms and locker rooms. And even that will not be \nenough because they will still be exposed to agency investigations and private litigation when, \ninevitably, Rule objectors (e.g., parents and students) sue them because of their compliance and Rule \nproponents file complaints with the Department and sue them for failure to adequately comply. \nFinally, if States, education agencies, and schools consider resisting the Rule, they will run straight into \nthe Department’s awesome coercive power to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding. The Rule \nis lose-lose-lose across the board. \n6.  Through all these mandates and many others, the Rule does extraordinary violence to \nTitle IX. Forcing a young girl to change clothes in front of a boy or man in a locker room is entirely \nantithetical to the dignity and respect that Title IX was intended to preserve and advance. So, too, is \nforcing children of opposite sexes to share adjoining stalls in the traditionally private space of a \nbathroom. These are not close questions. And if the Final Rule stands, it will gut the very essence of \nTitle IX and destroy decades of advances in equal educational opportunities, especially for women \nand girls.  \n7.  This lawsuit is intended to save Title IX and protect the myriad interests threatened \nby the Final Rule. By any measure, the Final Rule is unlawful. Plaintiffs thus respectfully urge the \nCourt to (a) postpone the Rule’s August 1, 2024 effective date, stay the Rule, or grant injunctive relief \nagainst the Rule’s enforcement; (b) grant declaratory relief stating the Rule is unlawful; (c) vacate and \nset aside the Rule; and (d) award them all other relief requested herein. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This action arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1681–88, and the Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 701–706.

His principal address is 950 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, \nWashington, District of Columbia 20530. Defendant Garland has responsibilities related to the \nimplementation and enforcement of Title IX. See Exec. Order 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. 2, \n1980). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY HISTORY \nA.  Congress Enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to Promote \nEqual Opportunities in Education for Both Sexes by Imposing Conditions on \nFederal Funding.  \n \n39.  In 1969, President Richard Nixon created a task force to study the status of women in \nAmerican society and to consider federal policies that could improve their opportunities. The task \nforce’s findings were disheartening: “So widespread and pervasive are discriminatory practices against \nwomen that they have come to be regarded, more often than not, as normal.” PRESIDENT’S TASK \nFORCE ON WOMEN’S RTS. & RESPS., A MATTER OF SIMPLE JUSTICE, III (1970). \n40.  The task force identified education as an avenue for improving equal opportunities for \nwomen and recommended that Congress “authorize the Attorney General to aid women and parents \nof minor girls in suits seeking equal access to public education, and to require the Office of Education \nto make a survey concerning the lack of equal educational opportunities for individuals by reason of \nsex.” Id. at IV. \n41.  Representative Patsy Mink, who played a vital role in Title IX’s adoption, echoed the \ntask force’s concerns about the “insidious” discrimination against women in education that deprived \nwomen “of the opportunity for an equal chance” and urged the U.S. House of Representatives to take \naction. Patsy  T. Mink,  Patsy T. Mink Papers:  Testimony by Rep. Mink in Support of Elimination of \n9   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 11 of 54 PageID #:  522\n \nDiscrimination against Women in Higher Education, during Hearing before the Special Subcomm. on Educ. of the H. \nComm. on Educ. and Labor (June 24, 1970), https://tinyurl.com/ya9pejx5. \n42.  In 1972, Congress finally acted. It passed Title IX to remedy “one of the great failings \nof the American educational system”—“the continuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination \nagainst women” that “reaches into all facets of education,” 118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (Feb. 28, 1972) \n(statement  of  Sen.  Birch  Bayh)—and  to  “guarantee  that  women,  too,  enjoy  the  educational \nopportunity every American deserves,” 117 Cong. Rec. 32,476 (Sept. 20, 1971) (statement of Sen. \nBirch Bayh); see N. Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 526 (1982) (noting that Senator Bayh was “the \nsponsor of the language ultimately enacted”). President Nixon signed Title IX into law on June 23, \n1972. See Pub. L. No. 92-318, Title IX, 86 Stat. 235, 373–75 (codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq.).  \n43.  Title IX’s text provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  [with  certain  statutory \nexceptions.]” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n44.  At the time of Title IX’s enactment, the term “sex” meant a person’s biological sex—\nmale or female—which “is an immutable characteristic determined” at “birth.” Frontiero v. Richardson, \n411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality op.); see, e.g., Sex, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 \n(1966) (“one of the two divisions of organic esp. human beings respectively designated male or \nfemale”); Sex, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1972) (“[E]ither of the two divisions, male or female, into \nwhich persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their reproductive functions.”); Sex, \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1187 (1969) (“a. The property or quality by which organisms are classified \naccording to their reproduction functions. b. Either of two divisions, designated male and female, of \nthis classification.”).  \n10   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 12 of 54 PageID #:  523\n \n45.  The statute uses this ordinary meaning of “sex.” See, e.g., Neese v. Becerra, No. 2:21-cv-\n163-Z, 2022 WL 1265925, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2022) (“Title IX presumes sexual dimorphism \nin section after section, requiring equal treatment for each ‘sex.’”); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(2) (discussing \ninstitutions that were “changing from being an institution which admits only students of one sex to \nbeing an institution which admits students of both sexes”); 1681(a)(8) (referring to “students of one \nsex” and “students of the other sex”). \n46.  Title IX thus promotes equal educational opportunities—and dignity and respect for \nmen and women—by generally prohibiting recipients of federal funds from discriminating against a \nperson based on his or her biological sex. At the same time, Title IX respects the biological differences \nbetween men and women that occasionally demand differentiation between the two sexes to promote \nrespect for both. Title IX instructs, for example, that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to \nprohibit” institutions receiving federal funds “from maintaining separate living facilities for the \ndifferent sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. This reflects the congressional understanding that separating the \nsexes “where personal privacy must be preserved” is not discrimination. See 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (Feb. \n28, 1972) (Statement of Sen. Birch Bayh) (explaining Title IX “permit[s] differential treatment by sex” \nwhen necessary, such as “in sport facilities or other instances where personal privacy must be \npreserved”). \n47.  Title IX also allows a subset of institutions and programs, such as traditional single-\nsex schools and certain religious schools, to remain limited to “one sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3), (5). \nSimilarly, it authorizes certain groups and activities to remain limited to one sex, such as sororities, \nfraternities,  Girl  Scouts,  Boy  Scouts,  Girls  State  conference,  and  Boys  State  conference.  Id. \n§ 1681(a)(6)–(7). Title IX additionally permits single-sex activities like “father-son or mother-daughter \nactivities at an educational institution” as long as “opportunities for reasonably comparable activities” \nare “provided for students of the other sex.” Id. § 1681(a)(6)-(7), (8).  \n11   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 13 of 54 PageID #:  524\n \n48.  Implementing regulations, including the earliest ones (and those still in effect today), \nlikewise understood that Title IX does not ban all differential treatment based on sex. To the contrary, \nregulations recognized that differential treatment is sometimes necessary to afford equal opportunities \ndue to biological differences. \nB.  As  Mandated  by  Statute,  the  Department’s  Predecessor  Issued  Regulations \nImplementing Title IX. \n \n49.  Following Title IX’s passage, Congress recognized that more guidance was necessary. \nCongress therefore passed what is known as the “Javits Amendment” in 1974. That amendment \nrequired the Department’s predecessor to promulgate regulations to effectuate Title IX, including \n“with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions considering the nature of \nparticular sports.” Pub. L. No. 93-380, Title VIII, Part D, § 844, 88 Stat. 612.1  \n50.  In compliance with that statutory mandate, the Department’s predecessor published \nregulations implementing Title IX (the “1975 Regulations”) on June 4, 1975. See U.S. Dep’t of Health, \nEduc., & Welfare, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex Under Federally Assisted Education Programs and \nActivities, 40 Fed. Reg. 24,128 (Jun. 4, 1975) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 86). \n51.  Congress subjected the 1975 Regulations to a statutory “laying before” provision, \nunder  which  Congress  could  disapprove  them  by  resolution  within  45  days  if  it  found  them \ninconsistent with Title IX. See General Education Provisions Act, Pub. L. 93-380, 88 Stat. 567.  \n52.  During that time period for congressional review, “[r]esolutions of disapproval were \nintroduced in both Houses of Congress” and discussed. N. Haven, 456 U.S. at 532 & n.22. One House \nsubcommittee “held six days of hearings to determine whether the [1975 Regulations] were ‘consistent \n \n1 The Department was created in 1979 through the Department of Education Organization Act, and \nit formally adopted and recodified the 1975 Regulations without substantive changes when it began \noperations in 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. 30,802, 30,955–65 (May 9, 1980) (codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106). \n12   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 14 of 54 PageID #:  525\n \nwith the law and with the intent of the Congress in enacting the law.’” Id. at 532. Ultimately, the \nresolutions failed, and the 1975 Regulations went into effect. Id. at 533.  \n53.  Given the special congressional scrutiny that the 1975 Regulations endured, the \nSupreme Court has repeatedly “recognized the probative value” of the 1975 Regulations in light of \n“Title IX’s unique post enactment history.” Grove City Coll. v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 567 (1984). \n54.  The 1975 Regulations provide that, “[e]xcept as provided elsewhere . . . no person \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education \nprogram or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance.” 40 Fed. Reg. \nat 24,140 (codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)) (emphasis added).  \n55.  Provisions throughout the 1975 Regulations emphasize three key aspects of Title IX’s \ngeneral prohibition on discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities.  \n56.  First, the 1975 Regulations demonstrate that sex discrimination means discrimination \nagainst someone based on his or her sex as a male or female. The 1975 Regulations thus referred to \n“women and men” and “male and female teams,” id. at 24,132, 24,135, contrasted payment rates \nbetween “one sex” and the “opposite sex,” id. at 24,135, and prohibited discrimination “against \nmembers of either sex,” id. at 24,134. \n57.  Second, the 1975 Regulations underscore that not all differential treatment based on sex \nis prohibited discrimination. That is why the 1975 Regulations permit funding recipients to “separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex” as long as “such facilities provided for \nstudents of one sex” are “comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” Id. at \n24,141. That is also why the regulations allow the “separation of students by sex within physical \neducation classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, \nbasketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.” Id. And \n13   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 15 of 54 PageID #:  526\n \nit is why they allow “[p]ortions of classes in elementary and secondary schools which deal exclusively \nwith human sexuality” to be “conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.” Id.  \n58.  Third,  the  1975  Regulations  show  that  sometimes  biological  differences  make \ndifferential treatment based on sex necessary to provide equal opportunities. That is why the 1975 \nRegulations “requir[e] the use of standards for measuring skill . . . in physical education which do not \nimpact adversely on members of one sex.” Id. at 24,132; see id. (explaining this requirement is necessary \nbecause certain standards “may be virtually out-of-reach for many more women than men because of \nthe difference in strength between the average person of each sex”); see also id. at 24,141 (“Where use \nof a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect \non members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards which do not have such effect.”).  \n59.  Subsequent interpretations and regulations likewise carry forward these three features \nof Title IX. See, e.g., Dep’t of Health, Educ., & Welfare, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; a \nPolicy Interpretation; Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,414 (Dec. 11, 1979) \n(“athletic  interests  and  abilities  of  male  and  female  students  must  be  equally  effectively \naccommodated”); id. (explaining that most institutions would be obligated to develop “athletic \nprograms that substantially expand opportunities for women to participate and compete at all levels”); \nid. at 71,415 (“Some aspects of athletic programs may not be equivalent for men and women because \nof unique aspects of particular sports or athletic activities.”); Dep’t of Educ., Establishment of Title and \nChapters, 45 Fed. Reg. 30,802, 30,960 (May 9, 1980) (discussing “[h]ousing provided by a recipient to \nstudents of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex”). \n60.  Title IX and the early implementing regulations, not to mention current regulations,2 \nthus evince Congress’s policy decision to promote equal educational opportunities for both sexes \n \n2 See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)-(c) (allowing single-sex teams and requiring recipients to provide “equal \nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes”). \n14   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 16 of 54 PageID #:  527\n \nwhile not disregarding biological differences or mandating identical treatment of males and females in \nall circumstances—a decision that has proven enormously successful as (among many other things) \nfemale college attendance and participation in athletics has skyrocketed. See, e.g., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of \nSt.  Johns  Cnty.,  57  F.4th  791,  818–19  (11th  Cir.  2022)  (Lagoa,  J.,  concurring)  (describing  the \n“remarkable impact Title IX has had on girls and women in sports”). \nII.  ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICATION OF TITLE IX \nA.  Title  IX  Is  Enforced  Through  Administrative  Enforcement  Proceedings  and \nLitigation. \n61.  Through OCR, the Department enforces Title IX and regulations by, among other \nthings, investigating discrimination complaints and seeking voluntary measures to cure violations. \nInvestigations impose costs and burdens on funding recipients, as do compliance measures. \n62.  If a recipient of federal funds fails or refuses to comply with Title IX or Title IX \nregulations, Defendants can pursue administrative enforcement proceedings or refer the matter to the \nU.S. Department of Justice for litigation. See Title IX Legal Manual, V. Federal Funding Agency Methods \nto Enforce Compliance, available at https://tinyurl.com/byjsscde. Both impose costs and can culminate \nin the termination of federal funding. See id. \n63.  The threat of terminating federal funding is a powerful tool because the Department \nprovides funding to public K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, as well as most private higher \neducational institutions. \n64.  In addition to Defendants’ enforcement options, private individuals can also enforce \nTitle IX and regulations through private litigation. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 680 \n(1979) (holding Title IX contains an implied private right of action and a woman could sue medical \nschools for denying her admission due to her sex). \n15   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 17 of 54 PageID #:  528\n \nB.  The Department and the Supreme Court Find that Harassment Can Violate Title \nIX  When  It  Is  Based  on  Sex  and  Effectively  Bars  Access  to  Educational \nOpportunities. \n \n65.  Since the 1980s, the Department has taken the position that sexual harassment can be \na form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, \nPolicy Mem., Antonio J. Califa, Director for Litigation Enforcement and Policy Services (Aug. 31, \n1981). \n66.  The Department stated that sexual harassment can severely interfere with a student’s \neducation,  not  to  mention  general  well-being,  and  emphasized  the  importance  of  ensuring \n“nondiscriminatory, safe environments in which students can learn.” U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office of \nCivil Rights, Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third \nParties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034, 12,034 (Mar. 13, 1997). \n67.  While acknowledging the seriousness of sexual harassment and attempting to remedy \nthat discrimination, the Department also recognized the danger to Free Speech rights if recipients did \nnot properly distinguish between prohibited conduct and protected free speech. It therefore issued \nguidance stating that “Title IX is intended to protect students from sex discrimination, not to regulate \nthe content of speech.” Id. at 12,045. It also admonished schools to “formulate, interpret, and apply \n[Title IX’s] rules so as to protect academic freedom and free speech rights.” Id. \n68.  The Supreme Court has also concluded that sexual harassment of a student can be \ndiscrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that violates Title IX (and creates \nliability in private damages suits) in certain circumstances. See Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 63–64, 75 (1992) (describing a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student on school property). \nIt has clarified that funding recipients violate Title IX when they have “actual knowledge” of a \nteacher’s  sexual  harassment  of  a  student  and  respond  with  “deliberate  indifference”  to  that \ndiscrimination. Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290–91 (1998). \n16   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 18 of 54 PageID #:  529\n \n69.  When it comes to student-on-student sexual harassment, a recipient violates Title IX \nwhen that harassment “is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the \nvictim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit” and “the funding recipient acts with \ndeliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.” Davis v. Monroe Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999). The Supreme Court explained that liability is limited “to \ncircumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the \ncontext in which the known harassment occurs,” otherwise it cannot be said that the recipient caused \nthe victim to face the sex-based harassment “‘under’ the recipient’s programs.” Id. at 645. \n70.  The discriminatory conduct in Davis involved more than verbal conduct, so the \nmajority opinion did not need to address First Amendment concerns. See id. at 653. The dissent in \nDavis, however, noted that attempts to curb allegedly harassing speech could run afoul of the First \nAmendment. See id. at 667 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  \nIII.  RECENT EXECUTIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS \nA.  In 2016, the Department Unsuccessfully Attempted to Change the Meaning of \n“Sex” in Title IX.  \n71.  Recently, the Department dramatically departed from the plain meaning of Title IX, \nits own longstanding positions, and decades of precedent.  \n72.  In May 2016, OCR and the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice \nissued a “Dear Colleague” letter that adopted a radical definition of the term “sex” in Title IX. U.S. \nDep’t  of  Educ.,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Dear  Colleague  Letter,  at  1  (May  13, \n2016), https://tinyurl.com/mt554jvu (“2016 Dear Colleague Letter”). \n73.  That letter instructed schools and universities that the Department would “treat a \nstudent’s  gender  identity  as  the  student’s  sex  for  purposes  of  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulations” and referred to gender identity as an “internal sense of gender” that “may be different \nfrom or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth.” Id. at 1–2. That instruction had dramatic \n17   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 19 of 54 PageID #:  530\n \nramifications. To retain federal funding under the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, State recipients would \nhave to allow males who claim that they are female to use women’s restrooms and locker rooms, play \non women’s teams, and participate in the girls-only sex-education classes. Id. at 3–4.  \n74.  For  obvious  reasons,  22  States,  including  Louisiana,  filed  lawsuits  to  block  the \nDepartment and other federal defendants from implementing and enforcing the 2016 Dear Colleague \nLetter. See Compl., Texas et al. v. United States et al., No. 7:16-cv-00051 (N.D. Tex. May 25, 2016); \nCompl., Nebraska et al. v. United States et al., No. 4:16-cv-03117 (D. Neb. July 8, 2016). \n75.  A district court promptly enjoined enforcement of the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, \nTexas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 836 (N.D. Tex. 2016), and the Department (under a new \nAdministration) rescinded the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter shortly thereafter, see U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nOffice for Civil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter (Feb. 22, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/bdhux7sm.  \nB.  In  2020,  the  Department  Issued  Title  IX  Regulations  Addressing  Sexual \nHarassment and Grievance Procedures.  \n \n76.  On May 19, 2020, the Department published Title IX regulations primarily focused \non sexual harassment and grievance procedures. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis \nof Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, \n2020) (“2020 Regulations”).  \n77.  The 2020 Regulations were designed to “obligate recipients to respond promptly and \nsupportively to persons alleged to be victimized by sexual harassment, resolve allegations of sexual \nharassment promptly and accurately under a predictable, fair grievance process that provides due \nprocess protections to alleged victims and alleged perpetrators of sexual harassment, and effectively \nimplement remedies for victims.” Id. at 30,026. \n78.  Recognizing that alleged sexual harassment can involve verbal and expressive conduct \nthat raises potential First Amendment concerns, the 2020 Regulations adopted the Davis formulation \n18   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 20 of 54 PageID #:  531\n \nof sexual harassment for “purely verbal harassment.” Id. at 30,142. Accordingly, it considered verbal \nharassment to constitute sex discrimination for Title IX purposes when it “is so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.” Id. at 30,141; see id. \nat 30,033. The 2020 Regulations also defined sexual harassment to expressly include “quid pro quo \nharassment and Clery Act/[Violence Against Women Act] sex offenses.” Id. at 30,033. For quid pro \nquo sexual harassment and sexual assault, the 2020 Regulations imposed no similar severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive requirement, reasoning that “prohibiting such conduct presents no First \nAmendment concerns” and “such serious misconduct causes denial of equal educational access.” Id.  \n79.  The 2020 Rule also tracked Supreme Court precedent in other ways, including by \nrecognizing that recipients violate Title IX only when they have “actual knowledge” of sexual \nharassment and are deliberately indifferent to it. Id. at 30,033–34. \nC.  In 2021, the Department Again Unsuccessfully Attempted to Change the Meaning \nof “Sex” in Title IX.  \n80.  After the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), \nthe Department (under the Biden Administration) again tried to redefine the meaning of “sex” for \npurposes of Title IX. \n81.  In January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order citing Bostock and declaring \nthat Title IX likely “prohibit[s] discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation” \nunless it “contain[s] sufficient indications to the contrary.” Exec. Order 13,988, Preventing and Combating \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023, 7023 (Jan. 20, 2021). \nThe order declared that “[i]t is the policy of [the Biden] Administration to prevent and combat \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation” and that agency heads should take \naction to implement that policy. Id. at 7023–24.  \n82.  In March 2021, President Biden issued another executive order that reaffirmed his \nAdministration’s policy regarding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n19   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 21 of 54 PageID #:  532\n \nSee Exec. Order 14,021, Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, \nIncluding Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803, 13,803 (Mar. 8, 2021). The order also \ninstructed the Secretary of Education specifically to take action to implement that policy. See id.   \n83.  Just a few months later, Defendants advanced a new interpretation of Title IX.  \n84.  On June 22, 2021, the Department issued a notice of “interpretation” of Title IX. See \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination \nBased on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 \n(June 22, 2021) (“2021 Interpretation”). \n85.  In the 2021 Interpretation, the Department announced that it now “interprets Title \nIX’s prohibition on discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ to encompass discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation and gender identity.” Id. at 32,637. It further announced that OCR would “fully \nenforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.” Id. at \n32,639.  \n86.  The very next day, on June 23, 2021, the Department released a “Dear Educator” letter \nnotifying educators of the 2021 Interpretation and its plans to “fully enforce” its new interpretation. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Dear  Educator  Letter  (Jun.  23,  2021), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ywrf7jb6. The letter also provided links to new guidance documents from OCR \nand the Department of Justice that “provide examples of the kind of incidents” that the Department \ncan investigate. See id. at 2. The examples demonstrated that Defendants would investigate recipients \nfor a Title IX violation based on students’ refusal to use a classmate’s “preferred pronouns.” See U.S. \nDep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for \nStudents and Families, https://tinyurl.com/58k7pkcd. \n87.  Once again, States, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, sued to \nchallenge the Department’s unlawful rewriting of Title IX. See Complaint, State of Tenn., et al. v. U.S. \n20   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 22 of 54 PageID #:  533\n \nDep’t of Educ., Case No. 3:21-cv-00308 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 30, 2021). And, once again, the States secured \nan injunction that prevented Defendants from enforcing their erroneous interpretation of Title IX \nagainst the States. See Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 842 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). \nD. In 2022, the Department Issued a Proposed Rule that Would Redefine “Sex” and \nWhen Harassment Constitutes Sex Discrimination under Title IX. \n88.  On July 12, 2022, the Department published a proposed rule that preceded the Final \nRule that is challenged in this lawsuit. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022) \n(“Proposed Rule”).  \n89.  In the Proposed Rule, the Department rejected the longstanding, ordinary meaning of \n“sex” and proposed to redefine discrimination “on the basis of sex” to mean “discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and \ngender identity.” Id. at 41,571. \n90.  Where “Title IX or this part permits different treatment or separation on the basis of \nsex,” the Department proposed to prohibit recipients from doing so in a manner that “subject[s] a \nperson to more than de minimis harm, unless otherwise permitted.” Id. The Proposed Rule declares \nthat “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a practice that prevents a person from participating in an \neducation program or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more \nthan de minimis harm on the basis of sex.” Id.  \n91.  In other words, the Department proposed, among other things, prohibiting single-sex \nbathrooms and locker rooms. That is because a recipient would be required to allow a male who claims \nto be a female to use girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms—otherwise the recipient would subject that \nstudent to “more than de minimis harm” that constitutes sex discrimination under the Proposed Rule. \nSee id. at 41,534.  \n21   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 23 of 54 PageID #:  534\n \n92.  These provisions of the Proposed Rule have implications for the fate of girls’ and \nwomen’s teams at any schools that receive federal funding: Under the logic of the Proposed Rule, \nwomen’s and girls’ sports teams will cease. That reality—and the political fallout of that result—is why \nthe Proposed Rule purports to defer the question of athletics to a separate rulemaking. See id. at 41,537. \n93.  The Department also proposed to jettison the 2020 Regulations’ definition of sexual \nharassment that drew from the Supreme Court’s decision in Davis, failing to properly account for the \ndifferences between verbal and physical conduct. See id. at 41,569. This, combined with the Proposed \nRule’s redefinition of “sex,” would require schools to police and curtail a whole host of protected free \nspeech. \n94.  The Proposed Rule creates additional constitutional problems, departs from the \nstatute in other ways, and would have serious detrimental harm on recipients, teachers, students, and \nsociety at large.  \n95.  Given all the Proposed Rule’s flaws, it is no surprise that the Department received \n240,203 comments about the Proposed Rule. Plaintiff Montana, joined by Plaintiffs Louisiana and \nMississippi, submitted a comment letter that detailed many of the problems with the Proposed Rule. \nSee Ex. B (Montana Letter). Plaintiffs Louisiana, Mississippi, and Montana also joined other comments \nraising serious concerns with the Proposed Rule. See Ex. C (Tennessee Letter); Ex. D (Ohio Letter); \nEx. E (Indiana Letter). \nE.  The Department Proposed a Title IX Rule Specifically Related to Athletics in 2023. \n96.  In April 2023, the Department issued a proposed rule regarding its regulation of sex-\nseparated athletic teams under Title IX. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \n22   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 24 of 54 PageID #:  535\n \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male \nand Female Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (Apr. 13, 2023) (“Proposed Athletics Rule”). \n97.  The Department stated that “the purpose of this regulatory action . . . is to propose a \nregulatory standard under Title IX that would govern a recipient’s adoption or application of sex-\nrelated criteria that would limit or deny a student’s eligibility to participate on a male or female athletic \nteam consistent with their gender identity.” Id. at 22,860. \n98.  It then proposed amending Title IX regulations to impose burdens on recipients that \ndesire to maintain girls-only and boys-only athletic teams and would require recipients to (1) allow \nboys who claim to be girls to play on some girls’ teams and (2) allow girls who claim to be boys to \nplay on some boys’ teams. Specifically, the Proposed Athletics Rule provides: \nIf a recipient adopts or applies sex-related criteria that would limit or deny a student’s \neligibility to participate on a male or female athletic team consistent with their gender \nidentity, those  criteria must, for each  sport, level of competition,  and grade  or \neducation level:  \n(i)  be  substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  an  important  educational \nobjective, and  \n(ii)  minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or \nfemale team consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. \n  \nId. at 22,891. \n99.  Despite the significance of the Proposed Athletics Rule and the incredibly damaging \nimpact it would likely have on women’s sports and female participation in athletics, the Department \nprovided only a month for the public to comment. Id. at 22,860.  \nIV.  THE FINAL RULE \n100.  Fast forward to today: On April 29, 2024, the Department published the Final Rule, \nwhich redefines “sex” in Title IX to embrace “gender identity” (and other concepts that are distinct \nfrom sex) and still purports to leave the politically nuclear topic of sports—and whether single-sex \n23   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 25 of 54 PageID #:  536\n \nteams are permissible—for another day. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. The Final Rule contains the same \nflaws as the Proposed Rule, see, e.g., Exs. B–E, and then some.  \n101.  The Department cites its “authority to issue rules effectuating [Title IX’s] prohibition \non sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the statute.” Id. at 33,476 (citing 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1682). Yet the Rule upends the entire Title IX framework, beginning with redefining what Title IX’s \ngeneral prohibition against discrimination on the basis of “sex” means. \n102.  Although 20 U.S.C. § 1681 prohibits funding recipients from subjecting a person “to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity” based on “sex,” the Rule expands Title IX to \ninclude “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” Id. at 33,476. These other grounds are not \ninterchangeable with sex. A recipient that treats a person differently based on some of these grounds \ndoes not always discriminate against that person based on sex. And, as explained above, Title IX at \ntimes  warrants  and  even  demands  recognizing  and  respecting  differences  between  the  sexes. \nDisregarding the differences between “sex” and, for example, “gender identity” (whatever that means) \nthus creates particular problems and inconsistencies within Title IX and the Rule itself.  \n103.  The Rule fails to define “gender identity,” but the Department “understands” it to \nmean “an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned \nat birth.” Id. at 33,809. Couched in those capacious terms, discrimination based on gender identity is \nnecessarily different than discrimination based on sex.  \n104.  Nevertheless, the Rule treats gender identity as synonymous with sex in certain \nscenarios. For example, the Rule requires recipients of federal funds to allow persons to use whichever \nsingle-sex bathroom or locker room corresponds with their claimed gender identity at that time. See \nid. at 33,818 (denying “a transgender student access to a sex-separate facility or activity consistent with \nthat student’s gender identity . . . would violate Title IX’s general nondiscrimination mandate”); id. \n24   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 26 of 54 PageID #:  537\n \n(agreeing that “students experience sex-based harm that violates Title IX when a recipient bars them \nfrom accessing sex-separate facilities or activities consistent with their gender identity”); id. (“a \nrecipient must provide access to sex-separate facilities, including bathrooms, in a manner that does \nnot cause more than de minimis harm”); id. at 33,887 (providing that failing to treat a person \n“consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the \nbasis of sex”).3 So under the Rule, every elementary school, middle school, high school, and university \nthat receives federal funding is prohibited from having single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms. This, \nof course, conflicts with Title IX and the earliest regulations that recognized having single-sex facilities \nlike bathrooms, locker rooms, and dormitories is not prohibited sex discrimination.  \n105.  The Rule gives recipients—along with students and staff—no measures to prevent this \nrequirement (that people be treated consistently with their claimed gender identity) from being abused. \nIndeed, the Rule suggests recipients cannot impose documentation requirements, such as requiring a \ndiagnosis of gender dysphoria (previously referred to as gender identity disorder), without causing \nprohibited “more than de minimis harm.” Id. at 33,819. And the Rule warns that persons cannot be \nharassed based on gender identity when “access[ing] sex-separate facilities.” Id. at 33,818; see id. at \n33,516 (“unwelcome conduct based on gender identity can create a hostile environment when it \n \n3 The Rule provides no meaningful guidance on how to deal with persons who do not identify with \neither the male or female sex. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818 (noting the Rule does “not specify how a \nrecipient must provide access to sex-separate facilities for students who do not identify as male or \nfemale” and suggesting a recipient may “coordinate with the student . . . to best provide the student \nwith safe and nondiscriminatory access to facilities”). But to the extent the Rule treats “sex” and \n“gender identity” as synonymous, a recipient may violate the Rule if it provides single-sex bathrooms \nfor males and females but declines to provide a single-sex bathroom that corresponds specifically with \na multitude of gender identities. See id. at 33,816 (noting that “there are stigmatic injuries, associated \nwith treating individuals differently on the basis of sex, and in such circumstances, no additional \nshowing of a more ‘material’ harm is required under Title IX”); What Are the 72 Other Genders?, \nMedicineNet (medically reviewed on Feb. 9, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/ymwestm3 (explaining that \nthere are 72 other genders “[b]eside male and female,” and “[t]he idea is to make everyone feel \ncomfortable in their skin regardless of what gender they were assigned at birth”). \n \n25   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 27 of 54 PageID #:  538\n \notherwise  satisfies  the  definition  of  sex-based  harassment”);  id.  at  33,884  (defining  sex-based \nharassment to include “other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the bases described [in the \nexpanded scope of Title IX discrimination in § 106.10]”).  \n106.  The Rule issues that warning because even comments questioning whether a person \nbelongs in a certain bathroom could be prohibited harassment under the Rule. See, e.g., id. at 33,516 \n(“harassing a student—including acts of verbal . . . aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on the \nstudent’s nonconformity with stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity or gender identity—\ncan constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX in certain circumstances”); id. at 33,514 \n(“a one-off remark . . . alone may not be severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, \nbut if multiple peers repeatedly call the student ‘girly,’ then that same treatment may create a hostile \nenvironment for that student”). \n107.  Such questioning is prohibited under the Rule because, along with redefining what \n“sex” means in Title IX, the Rule dramatically expands the 2020 Regulations’ “sexual harassment” \ndefinition (which it terms “sex-based harassment”) beyond what the text of Title IX can bear. Id. at \n33,884.  \n108.  Under the Rule, “sex-based harassment” is harassment based on any of the “bases \ndescribed in § 106.10,” id. at 33,884—that is, “sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender  identity,”  id.  at  33,886—and  is  “a  form  of  sex \ndiscrimination” that includes “hostile environment harassment.” Id. at 33,884. The Rule then defines \nhostile environment harassment as “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity \n(i.e., creates a hostile environment).” Id.  \n26   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 28 of 54 PageID #:  539\n \n109.  In other words, speech expressing critical views about the concept of gender identity—\nincluding views that are mainstream, widely shared, and legitimate—could be prohibited sex-based \nharassment under the Rule even if it is not “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \neffectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 633; \nsee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498 (recognizing the Rule’s definition is a “broader standard” than the Davis \nstandard).4  \n110.  Even comments not directed toward a person can give rise to “a complaint of sex-\nbased harassment” under the Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,654 (“[A] person who witnesses an incident \nthat creates a hostile environment for them may make a complaint on their own behalf.”). And much \nprotected First Amendment speech would be viewed as sex-based harassment under the Rule. See, e.g., \nid. at 33,570 (“academic discourse of students or teachers generally would not meet this standard” \n(emphasis added)); id. at 33,516 (discussing “unwelcome conduct based on gender identity” and citing \nU.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Discrimination, (last \naccessed  May  1,  2024),  https://www.eeoc.gov/sexualorientation-and-gender-identity-\nsogidiscrimination  (“SOGI  Guidance”));  SOGI  Guidance  (“Harassment  can  also  include,  for \nexample, offensive or derogatory remarks about a person’s transgender status or gender transition. \nAlthough accidental misuse of a transgender employee’s name and pronouns does not violate Title \nVII, intentionally and repeatedly using the wrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender \nemployee could contribute to an unlawful hostile work environment.”).  \n \n4 Expressing views on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, or sexual \norientation could also be classified as harassment. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,514 (indicating that \nderogatory comments about pregnancy could “create a hostile environment”). The Rule thus will chill \nspeech on a wide variety of topics.  \n27   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 29 of 54 PageID #:  540\n \n111.  Indeed, the Rule would compel students and teachers to use whatever pronouns a \nperson demands, see, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516, which creates conflicts with Free Speech and Free \nExercise rights, see, e.g., Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 511–12 (6th Cir. 2021).  \n112.  Similarly, the Rule will lead to the infringement of parental rights and will create Due \nProcess problems. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,596–97 (noting that even where the Title IX coordinator \ndefers to the parent about whether to file a complaint, “the Title IX Coordinator may still be required \nto, as necessary, take other steps,” such as training about harassment); id. at 33,821–22 (refusing to \nanswer “whether a recipient should comply with a request by a minor student to change their name \nor pronouns used at school if their parent opposes the change”); id. at 33,597 (allowing a Title IX \nCoordinator  to  override  a  parent’s  wishes  “with  respect  to  that  parent’s  child”  based  on  the \ncoordinator’s judgment about potential harm); id. at 33,537 (emphasizing that, “[t]o the extent that a \nconflict exists between a recipient’s obligations under Title IX and under FERPA [the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act], § 106.6(e) [of the Rule] expressly states that the obligation to \ncomply with the Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by the FERPA statute or regulations” \nand “that a recipient must not use FERPA as a shield from compliance with Title IX”); id. at 33,893 \n(requiring recipients to use a “preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to determine whether \nsex discrimination occurred, unless the recipient uses the clear and convincing evidence standard of \nproof in all other comparable proceedings”).  \n113.  The Rule accordingly makes it impossible for recipients to avoid liability. If recipients \ncomply with the Rule, they will face private lawsuits alleging they violated constitutional rights. And, \nif they fail to comply with the Rule or inadequately comply with the Rule, recipients will face Title IX \ninvestigations and enforcement actions and private lawsuits alleging Title IX violations. \n114.  The  Rule’s  redefinition  of  “sex”  and  dramatic  expansion  of  what  constitutes \nprohibited discrimination and harassment thus not only departs from Title IX’s text and purpose, but \n28   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 30 of 54 PageID #:  541\n \nit also substantially increases a funding recipient’s liability risk and Title IX obligations. See, e.g., id. at \n33,563 (“the recipient need not have incontrovertible proof that conduct violates Title IX for it to \nhave an obligation to respond,” but rather “if the conduct reasonably may be sex discrimination, the \nrecipient must respond in accordance with § 106.44” (emphasis added)). \n115.  Other aspects of the Rule also increase a recipient’s obligations and potential liability, \neither independently or in conjunction with other portions of the Rule, in a way that is contrary to \nTitle IX and arbitrary and capricious. See, e.g., id. at 33,888 (requiring all non-confidential employees at \nelementary  or secondary schools “to notify the  Title  IX  Coordinator when  the employee  has \ninformation about conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination” under the Rule); id. at \n33,548 (imposing extensive training requirements and acknowledging that the Rule “will require \nrecipients’ time and effort to update training materials and conduct additional training”); id. at 33,563 \n(“Some of the recipient’s duties under § 106.44 arise when the Title IX Coordinator has knowledge \nof conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination, but the recipient also has duties before \nsuch an occurrence.”); id. at 33,567 (noting that “the obligation to monitor for barriers to reporting is \nnot triggered only when a concern is raised over barriers to reporting,” but rather “[t]he Title IX \nCoordinator must monitor for barriers regardless of whether a concern has been raised about such \nbarriers”); id. at 33,598 (“When the Title IX Coordinator is notified of conduct that reasonably may \nconstitute sex discrimination and does not initiate a complaint, the Title IX Coordinator must take \nother appropriate prompt and effective steps to ensure that sex discrimination does not continue or \nrecur within the recipient’s education program or activity.”); id. at 33,682 (“Conduct that occurs under \na recipient’s education program or activity includes but is not limited to conduct that occurs in a \nbuilding owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary \ninstitution and conduct that is subject to the recipient’s disciplinary authority.”); id. at 33,869 (“In \nsome instances, such as when an alleged incident occurred outside of the United States and may have \n29   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 31 of 54 PageID #:  542\n \ncontributed to a sex-based hostile environment under the recipient’s education program or activity \ndomestically, the Department acknowledges that the resulting  investigation may be  more  time \nconsuming.”). \n116.  Finally, the Rule pretends that its dramatic overhaul of Title IX will have no impact \non whether it is permissible for schools to have separate athletic teams for women and girls. See id. at \n33,817 (“Until the [Proposed Athletic Rule] is finalized and issued, the current regulations on athletics \ncontinue to apply.”). But that cannot be right since the Rule takes the position that treating someone \nconsistent with his or her biological sex when they claim to be of the opposite sex constitutes more \nthan de minimis harm and sex discrimination. See, e.g., id. at 33,815, 33,887. That logic means that, in \nat least some circumstances, recipients would be required to allow males to play on female-only teams \nto comply with the Rule’s interpretation of Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination. And that \nposition is entirely unsurprising because it is the same position this Administration has urged federal \ncourts to adopt. See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, B.P.J. v. West Va. State Bd. of Educ., \nNo. 23-1078, ECF No. 68-1, at 12–13 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2023) (arguing that categorically prohibiting \nboys who claim a female gender identity from “participating on girls’ sports teams because their sex \nassigned at birth was male . . . discriminates on the basis of sex”); id. at 21–29. The Department’s \nattempt to run away from the topic of sports now can thus be explained only by the reality that the \nDepartment understands its position—if expressly promulgated in the Federal Register—would be \npolitical suicide in an election year. \n117.  The Rule is contrary to law, exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority, and is arbitrary \nand capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The Rule also imposes conditions \nin violation of the Spending Clause and is an unlawful exercise of legislative power. And Defendants \nviolated the APA’s procedural requirements by not providing a meaningful opportunity to comment \non the Rule. \n30   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 32 of 54 PageID #:  543\n \nV.  THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF THE FINAL RULE \n118.  Because the Rule disregards and effectively rewrites the statutory text, its issuance \nundermines our Nation’s constitutional structure and flouts the democratic will of the people as \nreflected in Title IX and duly enacted state laws that conflict with the Rule.   \n119.  In addition, the Rule subverts Title IX’s purpose and will particularly harm the precise \npopulation that Title IX was meant to help most—women and girls, who will now face increased \nthreats to privacy and safety, not to mention will lose spots on sports teams and podiums. See Adams, \n57 F.4th at 819–21 (Lagoa, J., concurring). \n120.  If that were not enough, the Rule will trample Free Speech and Free Exercise rights \nof students and teachers, “prescrib[ing] what shall be orthodox” and “forc[ing] citizens to confess by \nword or act their faith therein.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). Under \nthe Rule, a funding recipient would risk Title IX enforcement proceedings or private liability if it failed \nto take action when a student or teacher fails to use biologically inaccurate pronouns or expresses a \nbelief that Genesis 1:27 is true. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516; SOGI Guidance (characterizing “misuse” \nof pronouns as an example of harassment).  \n121.  The  Rule  causes  direct,  immediate,  and  ongoing  irreparable  harm  to  Plaintiffs \nspecifically, including by subjecting them to increased regulatory burdens, exposing them to litigation \nrisks, and overriding state laws and local policies on matters of traditional state and local authority.  \n122.  Because each Plaintiff State and its education systems, including elementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and postgraduate schools, receive federal funding for education programs and \nactivities, Plaintiff States are subject to the Rule. Harms to the Plaintiff States’ education agencies and \npublic universities are “necessarily . . . direct injur[ies]” to the Plaintiff States themselves. See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2366 (2023). And the Rule itself recognizes that States are regulated parties \nsubject to the Rule: “[A]ll 50 States have accepted Federal funding for education programs or activities \n31   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 33 of 54 PageID #:  544\n \nand are subject to Title IX as to those programs and activities,” and the Rule “appl[ies] to all recipients \nof Federal financial assistance,” including “State educational agencies.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,490, 33,541, \n33,634.  \n123.  Under Louisiana law, Plaintiffs Acadia Parish School Board; Allen Parish School \nBoard; Bossier Parish School Board; Caddo Parish School Board; Caldwell Parish School Board; \nDeSoto Parish School Board; Franklin Parish School Board; Grant Parish School Board; Jefferson \nDavis Parish School Board; LaSalle Parish School Board; Natchitoches Parish School Board; Ouachita \nParish School Board; Red River Parish School Board; Sabine Parish School Board; St. Tammany \nParish School Board; Webster Parish School Board; West Carroll Parish School Board (collectively, \n“Plaintiff School Boards”) are responsible for operating public elementary and secondary schools \nwithin their respective districts in Louisiana. They all receive federal funds and are subject to subject \nto Title IX and Title IX regulations.  \n124.  That means each Plaintiff is “an object of [the] regulation” and suffers an “increased \nregulatory burden” as a direct result of the Rule. See Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 \nF.3d 258, 264, 266 (5th Cir. 2015); see also Career Colleges & Sch. of Tex. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 98 \nF.4th 220, 234 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n125.  Indeed, the Rule does not dispute that it will impose costs on “all recipients,” including \n“time reading and understanding the final regulations” and “revis[ing] their grievance procedures.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,866–67. It also concedes that “all regulated entities will experience an increased \nrecordkeeping burden under the final regulations,” acknowledges that “recipients would be required \nto address more complaints,”  projects “a 10 percent increase in the number of investigations \nconducted annually,” and admits that the Rule “could result in increased costs to recipients.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,881, 33,492, 33,850, 33,877. \n32   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 34 of 54 PageID #:  545\n \n126.  The Rule is right that it will impose costs. It will cause Plaintiff States, their education \nagencies, and their public universities and the Plaintiff School Boards to incur costs to review and \nunderstand the Rule, as well as to update policies and procedures.  It will also cause ongoing costs as \na result of increased Title IX complaints, investigations, and private lawsuits (from Rule proponents) \nbased on, among other things, the (1) expanded scope of what constitutes discrimination on the basis \nof sex, (2) expanded definition of harassment that includes protected speech, and (3) application of \nTitle IX to conduct that occurs outside of the recipient’s programs and activities. Plaintiffs will also \nincur litigation costs to defend themselves against lawsuits from students, parents, and teachers who \nwill allege that Plaintiffs’ compliance with the Rule violated parental rights, Free Speech rights, Free \nExercise rights, or Due Process rights. See, e.g., Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 204 (3d \nCir. 2001) (Alito, J.) (“There is not categorical ‘harassment exception’ to the First Amendment’s free \nspeech clause.”). \n127.  Even putting increased obligations, litigation risks, and compliance costs to one side, \nthe Rule injures Plaintiff States and their educational agencies and Plaintiff School Boards by forcing \nthem into a lose-lose situation: (1) comply with an unlawful bureaucratic rewrite of Title IX with which \nthey do not wish to comply, or (2) lose millions or billions of dollars of federal funding for their \nstudents.  \n128.

The Rule accordingly could deprive Plaintiff States, along with their education systems \nand public universities, and Plaintiff School Boards of billions of dollars of federal funding.  \n134.  The  Rule  also  harms  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Education  specifically.  The \nLouisiana Department is often the direct recipient of federal funds and retains a portion of the federal \n \n5 Audit reports indicate Red River Parish School Board received $5,752,267 in federal funds in school \nyear 2020–21.     \n35   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 37 of 54 PageID #:  548\n \nfunds for administrative costs. But in order to receive the funds, the Louisiana Department must sign \nan assurance that it will comply with Title IX and regulations issued under Title IX.  \n135.  In addition to hurting the Plaintiffs’ financial interests, the Rule also harms the Plaintiff \nStates’ sovereign interests, including by interfering with their authority over education in their State, \ntheir democratically enacted laws, and their future ability to legislate. See Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, \n602 n.17 (2018) (explaining a State’s “inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts \nirreparable harm”); Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 845 (9th Cir. 2022) (concluding a State had standing \nwhere it alleged “infringement on its authority to set tax policy and its interest in being free from \ncoercion impacting its tax policy”); W. Virginia v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1149 (11th \nCir. 2023) (concluding States “suffered irreparable harm” where a statutory provision  allegedly \n“affected the States’ sovereign authority to tax”); BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (“The States, too, have an interest in seeing their constitutionally reserved police power \nover public health policy defended from federal overreach.”); Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. \n3d 807, 841 (E.D. Tenn. 2022) (concluding States “have sovereign interests in enforcing their duly \nenacted state laws” and plaintiff States “suffered an immediate injury” when the federal government \nissued guidance that conflicted with state law). \n136.  Louisiana enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act “to promote sex equality” by \n“providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities \nwhile also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition, accolades, scholarships, better \nphysical and mental health, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in \nathletic endeavors.” La. Rev. Stat. § 4:442(9). It accomplishes these goals, in part, by mandating that \nstate-funded schools’ “[a]thletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall \nnot be open to students who are not biologically female.” Id. § 4:444(B). \n36   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 38 of 54 PageID #:  549\n \n137.  Mississippi law promotes sex equality by requiring all state “public primary” and \n“secondary school[s],” and all state schools that are “a member of the Mississippi State High School \nActivities Association,” “a public institution of higher learning,” or a “higher education institution \nthat is a member of the NCAA, NAIA, or NJCCA,” to “expressly designate[]” their “[i]nterscholastic \nor intramural athletic teams” and “sports” “based on biological sex.” Miss. Code Ann. § 37-97-1(1). \nMississippi law prohibits “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for ‘females,’ ‘women’ or ‘girls’” from \nallowing participation by “students of the male sex.” Id. § 37-97-1(2); see id. § 37-97-1(1)(a)-(c) \n(designations). In addition, all “government entit[ies],” “licensing or accrediting organization[s],” and \n“athletic association[s] or organization[s]” are prohibited from “entertain[ing] a complaint, open[ing] \nan investigation, or tak[ing] any other adverse action against a primary or secondary school or \ninstitution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or \nsports for students of the female sex.” Id. § 37-97-3.  \n138.  Montana law defines the term “sex” as biological sex and specifically excludes the \nconcept of gender identity from the definition: \n[T]he organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings \nand other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, \nwith two corresponding types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological \nand genetic indication of male or female, including sex chromosomes, naturally \noccurring  sex  chromosomes,  gonads,  and  nonambiguous  internal  and  external \ngenitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual’s psychological, behavioral, \nsocial, chosen, or subjective experience of gender. \nMont Code. Ann. § 1-1-201(1)(f).  \n139.  In 2021, Montana enacted the “Save Women’s Sports Act.” See Mont. Code Ann. § 20-\n7-1306. That act requires athletic teams “sponsored by a public elementary or high school . . . or any \nschool or institution whose students or teams compete against a public school” to be “designated . . . \nbased on biological sex.” Id. § 1306(1). The Save Women’s Sports Act provides that “[a]thletic teams \nor sports designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male sex.” Id. \n37   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 39 of 54 PageID #:  550\n \n§ 1306(2). The Save Women’s Sports Act defines “female,” “male,” and “sex” pursuant to Mont. \nCode. Ann. § 1-1-201(1)(f).    \n140.  Montana’s parental involvement in education law protects the rights of students and \nteachers who refuse to use biologically inaccurate pronouns. Montana requires that a parent “shall \nprovide written consent before the parent’s child uses a pronoun that does not align with the child’s \nsex.” Mont. Code. Ann. § 40-6-704(1)(f). “If a parent provides written consent . . . a person may not \nbe compelled to use pronouns that do not align with the child’s sex.” Id.  \n141.  Idaho statutorily defines “sex” as “an individual’s biological sex, either male or \nfemale.” Idaho Code § 73-114(2)(n). That definition applies to all of Idaho’s laws “unless otherwise \napparent from the context.” Id. § 73-114(2). \n142.  Finding that there are “inherent differences between men and women” and that those \ndifferences “remain cause for celebration,” Idaho enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act. The \nAct ensures “sex equality” by protecting “opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, \nstrength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and \naccolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in \nathletic  endeavors.”  Idaho  Code  §§ 33-6201–6202.  The  Act  requires  that  state-funded  school \n“[a]thletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the \nmale sex.” Id. § 33-6203. Although Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act is currently enjoined, \nIdaho continues to defend the law and is appealing the injunction. \n143.  Because “[e]very person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms and \nchanging facilities,” Idaho also passed the Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public \nSchools Act to ensure that public school restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight accommodations \ncontinue to respect sex designations. Idaho Code §§ 33-6701–6707. Idaho Code § 33-6703 is presently \nenjoined on appeal, but Idaho continues to defend the law. \n38   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 40 of 54 PageID #:  551\n \n144.  The Rule conflicts with all of the above laws, hampering Plaintiff States’ “ability to \nenforce their conflicting state laws” and placing “substantial pressure” on them to change their laws. \nTennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 841; see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (“The obligation to comply with Title IX \nand this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that conflicts \nwith Title IX or this part.”). \n145.  The Rule also harms Plaintiff States by impeding their ability to enact and enforce \nfuture laws, including laws that are designed to safeguard women and girls and to safeguard parental \nrights.  \n146.  Indeed, the Rule conflicts with at least two such bills—the Women’s Safety and \nProtection Act and the Given Name Act—that are currently making their way through the Louisiana \nState Legislature. See H.B. 610, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (La. 2024); H.B. 121, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (La. \n2024). \n147.  The Rule similarly conflicts with a Mississippi bill—the Securing Areas for Females \nEffectively and Responsibly Act (“SAFER Act”)—that recently passed both houses of the state \nlegislature and will go to the Governor next. See S.B. 2753, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2024). \n148.  The Rule also conflicts with Plaintiff School Boards’ policies and practices that \nrecognize biological differences between boys and girls require separation based on sex in some \ncircumstances to protect privacy interests and promote respect, dignity, and equal opportunity for \nboth  sexes.  For  example,  Plaintiff  School  Boards  have  bathrooms  and  locker  rooms  that  are \nspecifically designated as being for “men” or “boys” and bathrooms and locker rooms that are \nspecifically  designated  as  being  for  “women”  or  “girls.”  Only  biological  males  are  allowed  in \nbathrooms designated for “men” or “boys,” and only biological females are allowed in bathrooms \ndesignated for “women” or “girls.” Plaintiff School Boards also follow Louisiana’s Fairness in \n39   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 41 of 54 PageID #:  552\n \nWomen’s Sports Act and only permit students who are “biologically female” to play on their school \nathletic teams that are designated for girls.  \n149.  Accordingly, the Rule harms the Plaintiff School Boards by interfering with their \nauthority to set policies and establish practices for their respective school districts that they think are \nin the best interests of their students. It will also cause the Plaintiff School Boards to expend time and \nresources to revise their policies and practices and to train staff regarding compliance. See 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,885. It will take a significant amount of effort to review and understand the 423-page Rule and \ntrain staff how to comply with it—especially because the Rule repeatedly fails to answer basic \nquestions about how it applies. See, e.g., id. at 33,821–22 (failing to answer questions, including \n“whether a recipient should comply with a request by a minor student to change their name or \npronouns used at school if their parent opposes the change” and “whether it would be a potential \nviolation of Title IX for a recipient to treat a student according to their sex assigned at birth if \nrequested by the parents to do so”).   \n150.  The Rule will also increase notification, monitoring, and recordkeeping requirements \nfor the Plaintiff School Boards. See id. at 33,573, 33,886, 33,888. It also increases Plaintiff School \nBoards’ obligations and costs in a variety of ways, such as requiring their Title IX coordinators to take \nactions to address potential sex discrimination even when a complainant decides not to initiate a \ncomplaint. See id. at 33,599.  \n151.  Furthermore, the specific changes that the Plaintiff School Boards will need to make \nto their policies and practices will cause additional harm. For example, Plaintiff School Boards will \nneed to instruct teachers to monitor and report students for comments that could be construed as \ndiscriminatory under the Rule, including a student’s expression of religious belief about human nature \nor a student’s refusal to use a classmate’s “preferred pronouns.” See id. at 33,514–16. This, in turn, will \n40   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 42 of 54 PageID #:  553\n \nincrease the Plaintiff School Board’s liability as some students and parents (on behalf of their children) \nwill inevitably sue the school boards for violations of First Amendment rights.  \n152.  The Rule’s requirement that schools allow essentially any biological male to use girls-\nonly bathrooms and locker rooms harms students’ privacy interests and creates serious risks of sexual \nassault. See id. at 33,816 (explaining the requirement that persons generally be treated consistently with \ntheir claimed gender identity “applies to any ‘person,’ including students, employees, applicants for \nadmission or employment, . . . parents of minor students, . . . visiting lecturers, or other community \nmembers”); id. at 33,809 (appreciating “that one person may not know another’s gender identity \nwithout inquiring unless the other person volunteers the information”); id. at 33,818 (warning that \npersons who claim to be the opposite sex cannot be harassed when using bathrooms designated for \nthe opposite sex); id. at 33,819 (warning that imposing a medical documentation requirement before \nallowing someone to use a bathroom that is consistent with claimed gender identity would be \ndiscriminatory); see also Ex. C at 9–11. Plaintiff School Boards will therefore need to incur significant \ncosts to develop strategies and make physical modifications to their facilities, such as converting \nbathrooms and locker rooms to single-user facilities, to try to counteract the Rule’s threat to students’ \nprivacy and security.  \n153.  Additionally, the Rule will create conflicts between parents and Plaintiff School \nBoards, including by limiting what information can be shared with parents and by requiring schools \nto address purported harassment even when that child’s parents disagree that harassment has occurred \nand do not wish to file a complaint. See id. at 33,821–22, 33,596–97. The Rule would, for example, \nprohibit Plaintiff School Boards from disclosing a student’s gender identity to classmates’ parents even \nwhen that student will be housed with their children. See id. at 33,622. In other words, the Rule will \nrequire schools to assign a biological boy (who claims to be a girl) to a girls-only room on an overnight \nfield trip and will prohibit the schools from informing those girls’ parents. The Rule thus increases the \n41   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 43 of 54 PageID #:  554\n \nrisk that Plaintiff School Boards will face lawsuits alleging infringement of parental rights, not to \nmention undermines Plaintiff School Boards’ efforts to build a relationship of trust with parents that \nresults in the best educational outcome for students. \n154.  The Rule will also harm Plaintiff School Boards by decreasing enrollment in their \nschools.  Many  parents  will  withdraw  their  children  from  the  public  schools  to  protect  their \nconstitutional rights, to protect their children from censorship and infringement of Free Exercise \nrights, and to protect their children from loss of privacy and serious risks of harm.   \n155.  In sum, the lengthy Rule will cause Plaintiffs to suffer an equally lengthy list of harms, \nwhich includes, but is not limited to, the harms listed above. And many of these harms, including \ncoercion and compliance costs, are already happening.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nThe Rule Is Contrary to Law. \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.) \n156.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n157.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not \nin accordance with law” or is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n158.  Defendants may exercise only authority conferred by statute. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. OSHA, 142 S. Ct. 661, 665 (2022) (“Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They \naccordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.”).  \n159.  Title IX gives Defendants no authority to: (a) redefine terms like “sex” to include \nseparate concepts, such as “gender identity”; (b) prohibit protected speech based on an unsupportable \ndefinition of hostile environment harassment; (c) compel speech and commandeer recipients to police \n42   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 44 of 54 PageID #:  555\n \nemployee and student’s pronoun usage; or (d) override Title IX’s text in the myriad of ways the Rule \ndoes. And that is especially true in light of other statutory provisions that limit the Department’s ability \nto interfere with the rights of States and local governments on education. See 20 U.S.C. § 3403(a)–(b). \n160.  Defendants thus exceeded their statutory authority by issuing the Rule, which is \ncontrary to the text and structure of Title IX, is otherwise not in accordance with law, and is antithetical \nto the advancement of equal educational opportunities and the promotion of equal dignity and respect \nfor the two sexes that Title IX aims to promote.  \n161.  Indeed, the Rule would flip Title IX on its head by likely causing discrimination against \nwomen rather than prohibiting it: Among other things, women (a) will be deprived of equal athletic \nopportunities, (b) will be forced to accept claims about what makes a person a women that often rely \non sex stereotypes,6 and (c) will likely suffer increased sexual violence as a result of the Rule’s failure \nto provide any safeguards against sexual predators who will exploit the defects in the Rule by claiming \na female gender identity even if they do not suffer from gender dysphoria so that they can access \nwomen’s bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers.7  \n162.  Defendants issued the Rule pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1682, which gives them no \nauthority to adopt regulations that subvert Title IX.  \n163.  Further, Defendants would need to point to clear authority to issue the Rule because \nit decides major questions—including whether to treat claimed gender identity as biological sex—that \nmust be decided by “Congress itself” or, at the very least, by “an agency acting pursuant to a clear \ndelegation from that representative body.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 735 (2022).  \n \n6 See, e.g., Chad Felix Greene, Being a Woman Requires More Than Makeup, Dresses, and TikTok Theatrics, \nThe Federalist (Oct. 26, 2022), https://tinyurl.com/56xzj4mt. \n7 See, e.g., Ex. C at 9–11. \n43   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 45 of 54 PageID #:  556\n \n164.  The  Rule  answers  major  questions  that  belong  to  Congress  or  require  a  clear \nauthorization for at least four reasons. First, the Rule has enormous social and political significance. \nSee id. at 721. Second, the Rule has significant economic consequences. Third, the Rule is “novel” and \n“transformative,” and Congress “has consistently rejected proposals” to expand Title IX to prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. See id. at 716, 724, 731–32. And fourth, \nthe Rule intrudes on areas of traditional state authority. See id. at 744 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n165.  Accordingly, the Department’s inability to point to clear congressional authority is yet \nanother reason the Rule is unlawful and must be set aside. \nCOUNT TWO \nSpending Clause Violation \n(U.S. Constitution, Article I, § 8, cl. 1) \n \n166.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to “to pay the Debts and provide for the \ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n168.  Incident to this power, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal \nfunds.” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987). But the Supreme Court has recognized several \nrestrictions on this use  of the Spending Clause power, including that: (1) conditions must be \n“unambiguous[]” so States can “exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \ntheir participation,” (2) conditions must be related to the “federal interest in the project,” (3) spending \nmust not “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,” and \n(4) spending must not “be so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’” \nId. at 207–11 (quoting Charles C. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937)). \n169.  Because Title IX was passed under Congress’s power to impose conditions on federal \nfunds, see Davis, 526 U.S. at 640, the conditions that it and its implementing regulations impose must \n44   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 46 of 54 PageID #:  557\n \ncomply with each restriction on the use of the Spending Clause power. The Rule’s conditions, \nhowever, flunk each of the four requirements described above. The Rule imposes conditions that: \n(1) are not “unambiguously” clear in Title IX, see B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078, 2024 \nWL 1627008, at *21–22 (4th Cir. Apr. 16, 2024) (Agee, J., dissenting); (2) are unrelated, if not contrary \nto, the federal interest; (3) will induce recipients to violate the constitutional rights of students, \nemployees, and parents; and (4) impermissibly coerce Plaintiff States, violating their sovereignty, see \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Buis. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78, 582 (2012); id. at 589 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \n170.  Finally, even if the Rule accurately reflected Title IX (it does not), Plaintiffs have been \ndeprived of their right to “voluntarily and knowingly accept[] the terms of the ‘contract.’” Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Plaintiffs did not know that they would be forced \nto accept the obligations, liabilities, and other conditions the Rule imposes, see supra Part IV, when \nthey accepted federal funds and agreed not to discriminate in their education programs and activities \nbased on biological sex (with certain statutory exceptions).  \nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of Article I \n(U.S. Constitution, Article I, § 1) \n \n171.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n172.  The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted” to Congress. U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 1 (emphasis added); see, e.g., Forrest Gen. Hosp. v. Azar, 926 F.3d 221, 228 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(“The Constitution, after all, vests lawmaking power in Congress. How much lawmaking power? ‘All,’ \ndeclares the Constitution’s first substantive word.”); Philip Hamburger, Nondelegation Blues, 91 Geo. \nWash. L. Rev. 1083, 1141–42 (2023); Jed Handelsman Shugerman, Vesting, 74 Stanford L. Rev. 1479, \n1506, 1550–51 (2022). \n45   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 47 of 54 PageID #:  558\n \n173.  Congress thus may not “abdicate or . . . transfer to others the essential legislative \nfunctions with which it is thus vested.” A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 \n(1935). Or, at the very least, Congress must provide “an intelligible principle” so it can be said that \n“the agency exercises only executive power.” Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 461 (5th Cir. 2022), cert. \ngranted, 143 S. Ct. 2688 (2023).  \n174.  If Congress delegated the authority to issue the Rule to Defendants—which it did \nnot—that delegation violates Article I and separation-of-powers principles. The Rule embodies major \npolicy decisions that are “the very essence of legislative authority under our system” and “must be \nmade by the elected representatives of the people.” Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. API, 448 U.S. 607, \n687 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).  \n175.  Furthermore, if the directive that the Department effectuate Title IX’s “prohibition \non sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the statute,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,476, allows it \nto issue the Rule, which subverts the primary purpose of Title IX and undermines the consistency of \nthe statutory scheme, then that directive is not a true “intelligible principle.” See Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n461. \n176.  The Rule, if authorized by statute, is therefore an impermissible exercise of legislative \npower.  \nCOUNT FOUR \nThe Rule is Arbitrary, Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) \n177.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n178.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n46   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 48 of 54 PageID #:  559\n \n179.  This means if an agency action is not “reasonable and reasonably explained,” it must \nbe set aside. Wages & White Lion Inves., L.L.C. v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1136 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)); see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. \n211, 224 (2016) (“[A] lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that is inconsistent with the \nDepartment’s longstanding earlier position results in a rule that cannot carry the force of law.”).  \n180.  An “agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). When an agency changes its position, the agency \nmust “recognize[] the change, reason[] through it without factual or legal error, and balance[] all \nrelevant interests affected by the change.” Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 469 (5th Cir. \n2024). \n181.  Moreover, an agency cannot “offer[] an explanation for its decision that runs counter \nto the evidence before the agency,” nor can it “fail[] to consider an important aspect of the problem.” \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43. And “bare acknowledgement” of a concern “is no substitute for \nreasoned consideration.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 473. Arbitrary-and-capricious review thus “has ‘serious \nbite.’” Id. at 470 (quoting Data Mktg. P’ship v. DOL, 45 F.4th 846, 856 (5th Cir. 2022)). \n182.  The Rule fails arbitrary-and-capricious review multiple times over. To summarize a \nfew flaws, the Rule is internally inconsistent, fails to define key terms, disregards evidence submitted, \nmakes decisions that are counter to the evidence before the Department, fails to properly balance all \nthe relevant interests that would be affected by the Department’s changed position, and routinely \noffers “conclusory statements” rather than real responses to valid and serious concerns submitted by \ncommenters. See id. at 473. \n47   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 49 of 54 PageID #:  560\n \n183.  The Department failed to adequately consider the important interests of individual \nprivacy, dignity, and safety that underlie Title IX. E.g., 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (explaining Title IX \n“permit[s] differential treatment by sex” “where personal privacy must be preserved”); cf. Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, The Fear of the Equal Rights Amendment, Wash. Post (Apr. 7, 1975) (“Separate places to \ndisrobe, sleep, [and] perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by \nregard for individual privacy.”). The Department instead rested on the conclusory statement that it \n“does not agree” that permitting biological males to access female-only spaces (like bathrooms and \nlocker rooms) will “compromise[]” “legitimate privacy interest[s].” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820. The \nDepartment also did not meaningfully respond to “evidence that transgender students pose a safety \nrisk to cisgender students”;8 again, it simply states it “does not agree.” Id. The Department also fails \nto consider a related important aspect of the problem: how to protect girls and prevent predators, \nwho are not suffering from gender dysphoria, from exploiting the Rule. \n184.  The Department’s failure to adequately assess such interests has produced arbitrary \nresults. For example, the Rule recognizes that Title IX expressly permits sex separation in “living \nfacilities.” Id. at 33,818 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1686). On this basis the Department omitted such facilities \nfrom the Rule’s new mandate. But the Department does not apply the same treatment to bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, or shower facilities—despite longstanding regulations permitting sex separation in such \nfacilities due to the similar implications for privacy, dignity, and safety.         \n185.  The Rule’s pretense of leaving the athletics regulations undisturbed even though those \nregulations conflict with the Rule’s stated interpretation of Title IX likewise demonstrates the Rule is \nnot a product of reasoned decisionmaking. The Department purports to sidestep the issue of athletics. \n \n8 Cisgender is defined by some sources as “a person whose sense of personal identity corresponds to \nthe sex and gender assigned to him or her at birth (in contrast with transgender)”; the term “arose in the \nlate 1990s.” Katherine Connor Martin, New words notes June 2015, https://tinyurl.com/3s5xde8s. \n48   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 50 of 54 PageID #:  561\n \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817. But athletics is one of the core features of the Title IX framework. And the \nDepartment’s redefinition of “sex” clearly will affect the continued vitality of single-sex facilities (like \nlocker rooms) and athletic teams separated based on biological sex, as the Biden Administration’s own \nlitigation position confirms. The Department cannot justify its failure to consider this important aspect \nof the Title IX regime by saving the issue for another day. That means the Rule’s refusal to respond \nto comments and evidence about athletics, including evidence that males have already taken athletic \nopportunities and championships away from girls and women, is simply another reason to conclude \nthe Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \n186.  The Department failed to adequately consider the Rule’s impact on parental rights. \nThe Department acknowledged the concerns expressed by many commenters that the Rule will \ninterfere with parents’ rights to “direct the upbringing and education of [their] children” and interfere \nwith state laws that safeguard parental rights in schooling. Id. at 33,821. In response the Department \nasserts that “nothing” in the Rule “disturbs parental rights” and “decline[d] to opine on how” the Rule \n“interacts or conflicts with any specific State laws.” Id. at 33,821, 33,822. This falls well short of \nreasoned explication or an adequate consideration of an important part of the problem. Indeed, the \nDepartment’s many such back-of-the-hand responses to significant concerns are reflected throughout \nthe  Rule.  They  demonstrate  the  Department’s  failure  to  adequately  “consider  and  respond  to \nsignificant comments received during the period for public comment.” Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, \n575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).                \n187.  The Rule’s refusal to provide any specific examples of how the new sex-based \nharassment standard would apply in relation to a student’s insistence that his or her classmate use \ninaccurate pronouns—or insistence that classmates use “neopronouns” like “xe/xir/xirs, ze/zir/zirs, \nand fae/faer/faers”— also demonstrates its lack of sound basis. See Understanding Neopronouns, Human \nRights Campaign (last updated May 18, 2022), https://tinyurl.com/5nh9bbae. \n49   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 51 of 54 PageID #:  562\n \n188.  The Department also failed to adequately consider important reliance interests. The \nRule will require States, school boards, schools, and other regulated parties to make substantial \nchanges to policies, practices, and procedures (and to make costly modifications to facilities) that were \ndeveloped based on the longstanding interpretation of Title IX. Yet the Rule barely acknowledges \nthese  concerns,  e.g., 89  Fed. Reg. at 33,856, and states  simply that the proposed  changes are \nnonetheless “warranted,” id. That is not reasoned consideration.         \n189.  Relatedly, the Rule’s cost-benefit analysis is wholly deficient. The Rule assumes the \naverage time to read and understand the final, 423-page regulation will be four hours for a Title IX \nCoordinator and lawyers. See id. at 33,866–67. This assumption defies belief, especially when the \nDepartment includes relevant details about recipients’ compliance obligations in the preamble. See, e.g., \nid. at 33,516, 33,812–13. The Rule’s other cost-and-benefit assumptions are equally absurd, including \nits failure to include any construction costs based on Defendants’ refusal to acknowledge the Rule will \nrequire schools to modify bathrooms and locker rooms. See, e.g., id. at 33,876. Separate from the Rule’s \ninaccurate monetary cost estimates, it improperly weighs “the non-monetary benefits” and costs \nbecause it fails to adequately account for the harms to privacy interests, the increased risks of sexual \nassault, the loss of opportunities for women athletes, and the constitutional harms (infringement of \nFree Speech rights, Free Exercise rights, parental rights, and Due Process rights). Id. at 33,877. \n190.  These examples are emblematic of the problems that run throughout the entire Rule. \n191.  This all shows that the Rule’s outcome was improperly pre-determined and tainted by \nbias, which is further demonstrated by the 2021 Interpretation and Defendant Lhamon’s involvement \nin the rulemaking process. See Justin Dillon and Stuart Taylor Jr., Ending due process: Reinstating Catherine \nLhamon at the Dept. of Education is a mistake, USA Today (June 14, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/3zfr44w4. \n50   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 11   Filed 05/03/24   Page 52 of 54 PageID #:  563\n \nCOUNT FIVE \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required by Law \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) \n192.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n193.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n194.  The APA requires agencies to publish notice of all proposed rulemakings in a manner \nthat “give[s] interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission \nof written data, views, or arguments.” Id. § 553(c). \n195.  Because the Department did not provide the public with an opportunity to understand \nand comment on Proposed Rule in light of the subsequently issued Proposed Athletics Rule, it \ndeprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on these inseparable issues, in defiance \nof APA requirements. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter an order and judgment \nthat grants the following relief, which it is authorized to do under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201, and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65: \na.

Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (“Final Rule”), is consistent with the plain text of Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (“Title IX”), 20 U.S.C. § 1681, Supreme Court precedent, \ndecisions in at least eight circuits, and congressional intent. \nTitle IX broadly prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); \nJackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 174-75 (2005) (emphasizing “repeated \nholdings construing ‘discrimination’ under Title IX broadly”). The Supreme Court, and many \ncircuit courts, interpret Title IX in light of Title VII. E.g., Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581, 616 n.1 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Schs., \n503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992)). Thus, given “the straightforward application of legal terms with plain and \nsettled meanings,” a prohibition on sex discrimination also covers discrimination based on being \npart of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) community. Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 590 U.S. 644, 662 (2020). \nBecause the Final Rule comports with Title IX and the U.S. Constitution, and better enables \nstates to advance their compelling interests in preventing harassment and discrimination and \nprotecting students from harm, Amici Curiae States (“Amici States”) submit the instant brief in \nsupport of ED’s opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nINTERESTS OF AMICI CURIAE \nAmici States have compelling governmental interests in the robust enforcement of Title IX \nto ensure that our schools operate free from sex discrimination. As sovereign jurisdictions charged \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:24  -cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 50   Filed 06/12/24   Page 12 of 25 PageID #:  2288\nwith enforcing state antidiscrimination laws and shaping school policies that foster a safe and \nsupportive  environment  for  all  students,  Amici  States  take  the  implementation  of  Title IX \nregulations seriously. Sex discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, and sex stereotypes imposed on LGBTQ individuals, cause direct economic, physical, \nand emotional harms to students. To prevent these tangible injuries, Amici States have adopted \nlaws and policies that combat sex discrimination against students on the basis that they appear, act, \nand identify as a sex different from their sex assigned at birth, or that they are attracted to someone \nof the same sex. \nAs Amici States’ experience demonstrates, preventing sex-based discrimination, protecting \nagainst sexual harassment, and ensuring equal access to educational opportunities for all students \nconfer wide societal benefits without imposing substantial costs on schools or compromising \nstudent privacy or safety. The same is true under the Final Rule, which includes explicit protections \nfor LGBTQ students and rectifies the harm caused to our schools and communities through ED’s \nprior rule (“2020 Rule”). The 2020 Rule undermined Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate by \narbitrarily narrowing the scope of Title IX’s sexual harassment protections. \nAmici States submit this brief to demonstrate, in sovereign states’ unique experience, how \ndiscrimination and exclusion on the basis of sex cause direct economic, physical, and emotional \nharms to our students, their communities, and their states and society as a whole, and that the \nbalance of equities and public interest cut against the extraordinary relief Plaintiffs seek. Amici \nStates encourage the Final Rule’s full implementation nationwide. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:24  -cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 50   Filed 06/12/24   Page 13 of 25 PageID #:  2289\nARGUMENT \nI.  AMICI  STATES’  EXPERIENCE  CONFIRMS  THAT  THE  FINAL  RULE  WILL \nYIELD BROAD BENEFITS WITHOUT COMPROMISING PRIVACY OR SAFETY, \nOR IMPOSING SIGNIFICANT COSTS. \nStates have a responsibility to provide public education, which encompasses a concomitant \nduty to protect students from harm. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. 180, 189-90 \n(2021). The Final Rule will promote states’ efforts to protect students from harm—in part by \nclarifying that Title IX protections against sex discrimination include protections for LGBTQ \nstudents—and will provide broad, significant benefits to LGBTQ students nationwide, without \ncompromising student privacy or safety, and without imposing substantial costs to our schools. \nA.  The Final Rule’s Benefits Will Not Compromise Student Privacy or Safety. \nAmici States’ experience demonstrates that policies allowing students to use facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity significantly benefit those students without risking student \nprivacy or safety. For example, allowing students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender \nidentity safeguards against harms common to transgender students, such as students foregoing \ndrinking or eating during the school day to avoid using the restroom for fear of exclusion, \nreprimand, or bullying.1  \nIn contrast, subjecting LGBTQ students to such discrimination and harassment, including \nby barring transgender students from facilities consistent with their gender identify, significantly \nharms LGBTQ students.2 For example, one 2021 survey showed that LGBTQ students who \nexperienced discrimination in their schools were almost three times as likely (43.3% versus 16.4%) \n                                                 \n1 See Assemb.

This, in turn, \nbenefits society as a whole, since equal education better prepares students to contribute to society, \nculturally and economically. Cf. Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954).  \nAmici States’ experience also demonstrates that allowing transgender students access to \nfacilities that correspond with their gender identity does not result in increased privacy or safety \n                                                 \n3 Id. at 36. \n4 Id. at 42, 45; Joseph G.

For example, in Washington, where \ndistricts must allow students to use the restroom or locker room consistent with their gender \nidentity, schools must provide any student “who has a need or desire for increased privacy, \nregardless  of  the  underlying  reason,”  with  “access  to  an  alternative  restroom  (e.g.,  staff \nrestroom . . .),” “a reasonable alternative changing area, such as the use of a private area (e.g., a \nnearby restroom stall with a door), or a separate changing schedule.”9 At least twelve other states \nand the District of Columbia offer comparable guidance to ensure that school districts can comply \nwith nondiscrimination policies and privacy concerns.10 Solutions range from offering privacy \n                                                 \n7 See Alberto Arenas et al., 7 Reasons for Accommodating Transgender Students at School, \nPhi Delta Kappa (Sept. 1, 2016); Beatriz Pagliarini Bagagli et al., Trans Women and Public \nRestrooms: The Legal Discourse and Its Violence, 6 Frontiers Socio. 1, 8 (Mar. 31, 2021). \n8 See Br. of Amici Curiae Sch.

THE FINAL RULE DEFINES “SEX-BASED HARASSMENT” IN A WAY THAT \nEFFECTUATES TITLE IX WITHOUT BURDEN OR SURPRISE TO THE STATES. \nThe Final Rule’s definition of sex-based harassment as conduct that “is so severe or \npervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s \neducation program or activity,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884, better enables stakeholders to prohibit \nharassment and redress hostile environments, and comports with the text and intent of Title IX. In \nAmici State’s experience, sex-based harassment need not be severe and pervasive to create \ntangible injury to a student’s education. For example, a teacher’s repeated inappropriate sexual \ncomments and intrusions of personal space may not be “severe,” but could be so pervasive that a \nstudent feels unsafe, avoids classes, and is effectively excluded from education. See, e.g., Feminist \nMajority Found. v. Hurley, 911 F.3d 674, 680-82, 687-89, 693 (4th Cir. 2018) (series of harassing \nsocial media posts sent over campus wireless network could support Title IX harassment claim); \n                                                 \n23 Kosciw et al., supra, at xviii-xx, 41-42. \n24 Kristina R.

For more than thirty \nyears, ED defined harassment as conduct that was “sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent” to \ninterfere with, limit, or adversely affect, rather than deny, a student’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit from an education program or activity, and consistently applied this definition to address \nharassment under Title IX and Title VI.26 Amici States have long understood that this definition \n                                                 \n25 Plaintiffs mistakenly rely on Davis to argue that harassment must be “severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive.” Br. at 27. But Davis makes clear that its rule applies only to private \ndamages claims, 526 U.S. at 652; see also Gebser, 524 U.S. at 283-84, 287, and does not otherwise \nlimit ED’s regulatory authority, see Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292. \n26 See, e.g., Racial Incidents and Harassment Against Students at Educational Institutions; \nInvestigative  Guidance,  59  Fed.  Reg.  11,448,  11,449  (Mar.  10,  1994);  Sexual  Harassment \nGuidance: Harassment of Students by Sch. Emps., Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. \n12,034, 12,038 (Mar. 13, 1997) (“[S]exual harassment must be sufficiently severe, persistent, or \npervasive that it adversely affects a student’s education . . . .”); U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Revised \nSexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or \nThird Parties (Jan. 2001), at v, 6 (noting that harassment must “deny or limit” student’s education, \nand single “sufficiently severe” incident of sexual harassment can create hostile environment); \nRusslyn Ali, Assistant Sec’y for Civ. Rts., Off. for Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague Letter (Apr. 4, 2011, \nwithdrawn Sept. 22, 2017) (“The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:24  -cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 50   Filed 06/12/24   Page 22 of 25 PageID #:  2298\napplies to their schools, and the Final Rule correctly returns to ED’s longstanding definition and \naligns with case law. See, e.g., Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (applying \n“severe  or  pervasive”  standard);  Franklin,  503  U.S.  at  75  (sexual  harassment  constitutes \ndiscrimination under Title IX); Doe v. Miami Univ., 882 F.3d 579, 590 (6th Cir. 2018) (applying \n“severe or pervasive” standard to Title IX harassment).  \nFinally, in Amici States’ experience, defining sexual harassment to encompass both severe \nand pervasive forms of harassment is essential to ensure the safety and sense of belonging that \nstudents need in order to learn and thrive. Students who experience safe and supportive school \nclimates see improvements in academic achievement and healthy development, and such schools \nare more effective at preventing violence and retaining teachers.27 (See also supra, at pp. 3-5.) \nIII.  THE FINAL RULE DOES NOT VIOLATE THE SPENDING CLAUSE OR OTHER \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS. \nAlthough the Final Rule is consistent with Title IX’s mandate, Plaintiffs insist that it \nviolates the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, arguing it violates the “clear-statement \nrule,” is unduly coercive, and could infringe on First Amendment rights.28 This argument runs \ncontrary to Amici States’ actual experience. The Final Rule does not require states to establish any \n                                                 \nrepetitive series of incidents to prove a hostile environment . . . .”); U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Q&A on \nTitle IX and Sexual Violence (Apr. 24, 2014, withdrawn Sept. 22, 2017) (same); U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., Q&A on Campus Sexual Misconduct (Sept. 2017, rescinded Aug. 2020) (applying “severe, \npersistent, or pervasive” and “deny or limit” standards). \n27 See,  e.g.,  Jenna  Howard  Terrell  et  al.,  Conceptualizing  and  Measuring  Safe  and \nSupportive Schools, 24 Contemp. Sch. Psych. 3 (Aug. 2020); Darling-Hammond et al., supra, at \n97-98; see also Ctrs. For Disease Control, Youth Risk Behavior Survey: Data Summary & Trends \nReport 2011-2021 72 (2023), https://tinyurl.com/2p6w6yrv. \n28 The Final Rule is consistent with the U.S. Constitution. Supreme Court precedent \nforecloses Plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge and undeveloped parental-rights argument. See, \ne.g., Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 82 (1998) (Title VII can prohibit verbal \nharassment); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civ. Rts. Comm’n, 584 U.S. 617, 631 (2018) \n(Free  Exercise  Clause  does  not  allow  discrimination  in  violation  of  “neutral  and  generally \napplicable . . . law”); Runyon v.

Many of the Amici States have already implemented these protections, and have \nincurred  de  minimis  costs  in  doing  so,  while  conferring  significant  benefits  to  students.29 \nMoreover, most courts have held that discrimination based on LGBTQ identity is sufficiently \nascertainable from Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination, so the clear-statement rule \nshould be satisfied. See Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 619 n.18 (4th Cir. \n2020); see also J.A.W. v. Evansville Vanderburgh Sch. Corp., 323 F. Supp. 3d 1030, 1037 (S.D. \nIn. 2018).30 The Final Rule does not transgress the constitutional limitations on conditions imposed \non federal spending. It requires funding recipients to do only what it has always required: refrain \nfrom discriminating against students on the basis of sex, and remedy any discrimination they may \nfind.  \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for emergency and preliminary relief. \n   \n                                                 \n29 School-based gender-affirming policies are linked to dramatic decreases in depression, \nanxiety, and suicidal ideation among transgender and nonbinary students.

No. 59] filed \nby Defendants.1 Plaintiff Rapides Parish School Board (“Rapides”) and the Louisiana Plaintiffs  \nfiled Oppositions [Doc. Nos. 65, 66].2 Defendants filed a Reply [Doc. No. 69]. \n  For the reasons set forth herein, Defendants’ Motion for a Partial Stay Pending Appeal is \nDENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n   \n  On April 29, 2024, the United States Department of Education issued a Final Rule, which \nredefined sexual discrimination in Title IX. The Final Rule redefines “sex discrimination” to \ninclude gender identity, sexual orientation, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics. Further, it \npreempts state law to the contrary and requires students to be allowed access to bathrooms and \n \n1 Defendants consists of U S Department of Education; Miguel Cardona, in his official capacity as Secretary of \nEducation; Office for Civil Rights, U S Dept. of Education; Catherine Lhamon, in her official capacity as the Assistant \nSecretary for Civil Rights; U S Dept of Justice, and Merrick B. Garland, in his official capacity as the Attorney General \nof the United States.1 \n2 Louisiana Plaintiffs consist of: State of Louisiana, by and through its Attorney General, Elizabeth B. Murrill; LA \nDept. of Education, State of Mississippi, by and through its Attorney General, Lynn Fitch; State of Montana, by and \nthrough its Attorney General, Austin Knudsen; State of Idaho, by and through its Attorney General, Raul Labrador; \nSchool Board of Webster Parish; School Board of Red River Parish; School Board of Bossier Parish; School Board of \nSabine Parish; School Board of Grant Parish; School Board of West Carroll Parish; School Board of Caddo Parish; \nSchool Board of Natchitoches Parish; School Board of Caldwell Parish; School Board of Allen Parish; School Board \nof LaSalle Parish; School Board of Jefferson Davis Parish; School Board of Ouachita Parish; School Board of Franklin \nParish; School Board of Acadia Parish; School Board of DeSoto Parish; and School Board of  St. Tammany Parish. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 71   Filed 07/11/24   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  2484\nlocker rooms based on their gender identity. Additionally, it prohibits schools from requiring \nmedical or other documentation to validate the student’s gender identity, requires schools to use \nwhatever pronouns the student prefers, and imposes additional requirements that will result in \nsubstantial costs to the recipient schools. \n  On April 29, 2024, Louisiana Plaintiffs filed a Complaint3 against Defendants. Louisiana \nPlaintiffs amended the Complaint on May 3, 2024.4 On April 30, 2024, Rapides filed a Complaint.5 \nThis Court consolidated both cases on May 15, 2024.6 \n  On May 13, 2024, Louisiana Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Postponement or Stay Under 5 \nU.S.C. § 705 or Preliminary Injunction7 . On May 14, 2024, Rapides filed a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction and Delay of Effective Date.8 On June 13, 2024, this Court granted the Plaintiffs’ \nMotions for Preliminary Injunctions. 9 \nOn June 24, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal.10 That same day, Defendants filed \nthe instant Motion for a Partial Stay Pending Appeal.11 \nIn Defendants’ Motion for Partial Stay, Defendants move the Court to stay only 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.31(a)(2) and the definition of “hostile environment harassment” within 34 C.F.R. § 106.2. \nDefendants also move to lift the stay for other provisions of the Final Rule, including 34 C.F.R. § \n106.2, which expands the definition of sex discrimination. \n  Defendants maintain the provisions are severable and that the Preliminary Injunction is \noverbroad. The Louisiana Plaintiffs and Rapides argue that Defendants waived the severability \n \n3 [Doc. No. 1]  \n4 [Doc. No. 11] \n5 [Doc. No. 1, Case #1:24-cv-00567] \n6 [Doc. No. 25] \n7 [Doc.

LAW AND ANALYSIS \nA.  Law \n  To obtain a stay of a district court decision pending appeal, Defendants “bear a heavy \nburden.”  Plaquemines  Parish  v.  Chevron  USA,  Inc.,  84  F.4th  362,  373  (5th  Cir.  2023).  In \ndetermining whether the stay applicant has satisfied their burden, the Court must consider four \nfactors:  (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on \nthe merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether the stay \nwill substantially injure the other parties interested in this proceeding; and (4) where the public \ninterest lies. Id. When government Defendants are applying for a stay and Plaintiffs are the \nopposing party, the factors do not merge, and the public interest factor is distinct. U.S. Navy Seals \n1-26 v. Biden, 27 F.4th 336, 353 (5th Cir. 2022). Severability is not determined by what was \nchallenged; rather, severability considers whether the removal of the unlawful provisions will \n“impair the function of the statute as a whole.” K-Mart Corp. v Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 \n(1988). \nB.  Analysis \nDefendants cannot meet their burden of showing that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits, that Defendants would be irreparably harmed, that there would be substantial injury to \nparties in this proceeding, or that it is in the public interest for portions of the Final Rule to go into \neffect.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 71   Filed 07/11/24   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  2486\nThe challenged provisions are so central to the Final Rule, such that it cannot operate \nwithout them. Additionally, leaving portions of the Final Rule to go into effect would still result in \nuncollectable compliance costs to recipient schools.  \nThe Court previously found eleven primary changes made by the Final Rule. The primary \nchanges were: (1) 34 C.F.R. § 106.10 redefines discrimination of sex to include sex stereotypes, \nsex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation or gender identity; (2) 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.6 declares the Final Rule preempts state law; (3) 34 C.F.R. § 106.8 requires recipient \nschools to designate, hire and pay for a Title IX Coordinator to ensure compliance with Title IX, \nand to provide training to employees; (4) 34 C.F.R. § 106.6 (b) prohibits any recipient school from \nadopting or implementing any practice or procedure which treats students differently on the basis \nof sex; (5) 34 C.F.R. § 106.44 requires recipients with knowledge of conduct that reasonably may \nconstitute sex discrimination in its education program or activity to mandatorily report such \nconduct to the Title IX Coordinator; (6) amends 34 C.F.R. § 106.45 to require an investigation and \nto impose grievance procedures; (7) prohibits recipient schools from requiring medical or other \ndocumentation to validate the student’s gender identity; (8) requires recipient schools to allow \nstudents to access bathrooms and locker rooms based upon their gender identity; (9) requires any \nstudent’s claimed gender identity be treated as if it was his or her sex and requires recipients to \ncompel staff and students to use whatever pronouns the student requests; (10) creates a new \nstandard for “hostile environment harassment” that could include views critical of gender identity; \nand (11) sets the rule’s effective date as August 1, 2024. \n  The Court concluded that (1) the Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds the U.S. \nDepartment of Education’s statutory authority, which includes a violation of the major questions \ndoctrine; (2) the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX ; (3) violates the Free Speech and Free Exercise \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 71   Filed 07/11/24   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  2487\nClauses of the First Amendment by compelling staff and students to use whatever pronouns a \nperson demands; (4) the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution \nby implementing ambiguous provisions; and (5)  the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious under \nthe Administrative Procedures Act. \n  This Court did not enjoin the Final Rule based upon only two provisions. Rather, the Court \nissued  an  injunction  after  finding  that  numerous  provisions  in  the  Final  Rule  violated  the \nConstitution. The  provisions  are  not  severable  because  the  removal  of  the  unconstitutional \nprovisions would impair the function of the statute as a whole. \n  Additionally, the Court found irreparable harm to Louisiana Plaintiffs and Rapides based \nupon costs for expanded record keeping requirements and expanded training requirements which \nwere imminent and unreasonable. Irreparable harm was also found based upon First Amendment \nfree speech and free exercise violations. Even if only portions of the Final Rule took effect, these \nPlaintiffs would still incur irreparable harm. \n  For these reasons, the request is DENIED. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth herein,  \n  IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for a Partial Stay Pending Appeal [Doc. No. 59] is \nDENIED. \n  MONROE, LOUISIANA, this 11th day of July 2024. \n \n            ________________________________________ \n            TERRY A.

Garland, in his official capacity as the Attorney General \nof the United States (collectively, “Defendants”) for declaratory and injunctive relief and allege as \nfollows: \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Today, the U.S. Department of Education—by the stroke of a pen and over 400 \nFederal Register pages drafted in Washington, D.C. conference rooms—published new Title IX \nregulations intended to transform the classrooms, lunchrooms, bathrooms, and locker rooms of \nAmerican schools. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (the “Rule” or “Final Rule”), Ex. A. There is \nnormal federal government overreach—and then there is the Final Rule: a naked attempt to strong-\narm our schools into molding our children in the current federal government’s preferred image of \nhow a child should think, act, and speak. The Final Rule is an affront to the dignity of families and \nschool administrators everywhere, and it is nowhere close to legal. \n2.  Title  IX  prohibits  educational  institutions  that  receive  federal  funding  from \ndiscriminating on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities. That prohibition promotes \nequal opportunity, dignity, and respect for both sexes—while at the same time recognizing (as both \nTitle IX and longstanding regulations recognize) that equality and dignity occasionally demand \ndifferentiation between the two sexes to promote respect for both. Such differentiation is not unlawful \ndiscrimination: It furthers the precise goals, and protects the precise values, that undergird Title IX. \n1  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 3 of 43 PageID #:  3\n \nAnd over the past 50 years, that basic understanding has driven remarkable progress and countless \nopportunities—in particular for women and girls—in American education. \n3.  The Final Rule drives a dagger through the heart of Title IX’s mandate. The central \nfeature of the Final Rule is the Department’s extraordinary move to transform Title IX’s prohibition \nof discrimination based on “sex” to include discrimination based on “gender identity”—a wildly \nambiguous term that itself is never fully defined in the Final Rule but that the Department describes \nas a student’s subjective and internal “sense” of his or her gender. And based on that key move, the \nDepartment sets out to remake our educational system and our children. \n4.   To take just a few examples: The Final Rule prohibits single-sex bathrooms and locker \nrooms. The Final Rule likewise compels school officials both to use pronouns associated with a \nstudent’s claimed “gender identity” and to force students to do so as well. And school officials should \nbe careful about requesting documentation to verify the sincerity of a person’s claimed gender identity, \nthe Department ominously warns, because that itself might violate the Final Rule. Moreover, although \nthe Department tries to downplay the Rule’s impact on athletics—because the Department knows \nthat extending its radical theory to athletics would be political suicide in an election year—the Rule \ncannot help but sound the death knell for female sports. \n5.  The consequences will be shocking and severe. Boys and girls will be forced to share \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and perhaps even lodging on overnight field trips with members of the \nopposite sex. Adding insult to injury, they will be forced to use “preferred pronouns” or else face \npunishment, which raises distinct Free Speech and Free Exercise problems. And that’s just the \nstudents. Consider parents who, for example, may never hear about so-called “gender affirming” \ncounseling that their children receive because the Final Rule allowed a school to conceal that \ninformation. Consider also teachers and other school administrators who will be forced to create and \ncarry out employee training programs on the 423-page Rule, change school policies, and likely begin \n2  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 4 of 43 PageID #:  4\n \ncostly construction projects to modify school bathrooms and locker rooms. And even that will not be \nenough because they will still be exposed to agency investigations and private litigation when, \ninevitably, Rule objectors (e.g., parents and students) sue them because of their compliance and Rule \nproponents file complaints with the Department and sue them for failure to adequately comply. \nFinally, if States, education agencies, and schools consider resisting the Rule, they will run straight into \nthe Department’s awesome coercive power to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding. The Rule \nis lose-lose-lose across the board. \n6.  Through all these mandates and many others, the Rule does extraordinary violence to \nTitle IX. Forcing a young girl to change clothes in front of a boy or man in a locker room is entirely \nantithetical to the dignity and respect that Title IX was intended to preserve and advance. So, too, is \nforcing children of opposite sexes to share adjoining stalls in the traditionally private space of a \nbathroom. These are not close questions. And if the Final Rule stands, it will gut the very essence of \nTitle IX and destroy decades of advances in equal educational opportunities, especially for women \nand girls.  \n7.  This lawsuit is intended to save Title IX and protect the myriad interests threatened \nby the Final Rule. By any measure, the Final Rule is unlawful. Plaintiffs thus respectfully urge the \nCourt to (a) postpone the Rule’s August 1, 2024, effective date, stay the Rule, or grant injunctive relief \nagainst the Rule’s enforcement; (b) grant declaratory relief stating the Rule is unlawful; (c) vacate and \nset aside the Rule; and (d) award them all other relief requested herein. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.

See Exec. Order, No. 12,250, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 (Nov. \n2, 1980). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY HISTORY \nA.  Congress Enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to Promote \nEqual Opportunities in Education for Both Sexes by Imposing Conditions on \nFederal Funding.  \n \n22.  In 1969, President Richard Nixon created a task force to study the status of women in \nAmerican society and to consider federal policies that could improve their opportunities. The task \nforce’s findings were disheartening: “So widespread and pervasive are discriminatory practices against \nwomen that they have come to be regarded, more often than not, as normal.” PRESIDENT’S TASK \nFORCE ON WOMEN’S RTS. & RESPS., A MATTER OF SIMPLE JUSTICE III (1970). \n23.  The task force identified education as an avenue for improving equal opportunities for \nwomen and recommended that Congress “authorize the Attorney General to aid women and parents \nof minor girls in suits seeking equal access to public education, and to require the Office of Education \nto make a survey concerning the lack of equal educational opportunities for individuals by reason of \nsex.” Id. at IV. \n24.  Representative Patsy Mink, who played a vital role in Title IX’s adoption, echoed the \ntask force’s concerns about the “insidious” discrimination against women in education that deprived \nwomen “of the opportunity for an equal chance” and urged the U.S. House to take action. Testimony \nby Rep. Mink in Support of Elimination of Discrimination against Women in Higher Education, \nduring Hearing before the Special Subcomm. on Educ. of the H. Comm. on Educ. and Labor (June \n24, 1970), available at https://www.loc.gov/item/mss8495700102?loclr=blogtea. \n25.  In 1972, Congress finally acted. It passed Title IX to remedy “one of the great failings \nof the American educational system”—“the continuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination \n6  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 8 of 43 PageID #:  8\n \nagainst women” that “reaches into all facets of education,” 118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (Feb. 28, 1972) \n(statement  of  Sen.  Birch  Bayh)—and  to  “guarantee  that  women,  too,  enjoy  the  educational \nopportunity every American deserves,” 117 Cong. Rec. 32,476 (Sept. 20, 1971) (statement of Sen. \nBirch Bayh); see N. Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 526–27 (1982) (noting that Senator Bayh was \n“the sponsor of the language ultimately enacted”). President Nixon signed Title IX into law on June \n23, 1972. See Pub. L. No. 92-318, Title IX, 86 Stat. 235, 373–75 (codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq.).  \n26.  Title IX’s text provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance  [with  certain  statutory \nexceptions.]” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n27.  At the time of Title IX’s enactment, the term “sex” meant a person’s biological sex—\nmale or female—which “is an immutable characteristic determined” at “birth.” Frontiero v. Richardson, \n411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality op.); see, e.g., Sex, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 \n(1966) (“one of the two divisions of organic esp. human beings respectively designated male or \nfemale”); Sex, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1972) (“[E]ither of the two divisions, male or female, into \nwhich persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their reproductive functions.”); Sex, \nAmerican Heritage Dictionary (1969) (“a. The property or quality by which organisms are classified \naccording to their reproduction functions. b. Either of two divisions, designated male and female, of \nthis classification.”).  \n28.  The statute uses this ordinary meaning of “sex.” See, e.g., Neese v. Becerra, No. 2:21-cv-\n163, 2022 WL 1265925, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2022) (“Title IX presumes sexual dimorphism in \nsection after section, requiring equal treatment for each ‘sex.’”); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(2) (discussing \ninstitutions that were “changing from being an institution which admits only students of one sex to \n7  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 9 of 43 PageID #:  9\n \nbeing an institution which admits students of both sexes”); 1681(a)(8) (referring to “students of one \nsex” and “students of the other sex”). \n29.  Title IX thus promotes equal educational opportunities—and dignity and respect for \nmen and women—by generally prohibiting recipients of federal funds from discriminating against a \nperson based on his or her biological sex. At the same time, Title IX respected the biological \ndifferences between men and women that occasionally demand differentiation between the two sexes \nto promote respect for both. Title IX instructs, for example, that “nothing contained herein shall be \nconstrued to prohibit” institutions receiving federal funds “from maintaining separate living facilities \nfor  the  different  sexes.”  20  U.S.C. § 1686.  This  reflects  the  congressional  understanding  that \nseparating the sexes “where personal privacy must be preserved” was not discrimination. See 118 Cong. \nRec. 3937 (Feb. 15, 1972) (Statement of Sen. Birch Bayh) (explaining Title IX “permit[s] differential \ntreatment by sex” when necessary, such as “in sport facilities or other instances where personal privacy \nmust be preserved”). \n30.  Title IX also allows a subset of institutions and programs, such as traditional single-\nsex schools and certain religious schools, to remain limited to “one sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3), (5). \nSimilarly, it authorizes certain groups and activities to remain limited to one sex, such as sororities, \nfraternities,  Girl  Scouts,  Boy  Scouts,  Girls  State  conference,  and  Boys  State  conference.  Id. \n§ 1681(a)(6)–(7). Title IX additionally permits single-sex activities like “father-son or mother-daughter \nactivities at an educational institution” as long as “opportunities for reasonably comparable activities” \nare “provided for students of the other sex.” Id. § 1681(a)(6)-(7), (8).  \n31.  Implementing regulations, including the earliest ones (and those still in effect today), \nlikewise understood that Title IX did not ban all differential treatment based on sex. To the contrary, \nregulations  recognized  that  differential  treatment  was  sometimes  necessary  to  afford  equal \nopportunities due to biological differences. \n8  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 10 of 43 PageID #:  10\n \nB.  As  Mandated  by  Statute,  the  Department’s  Predecessor  Issued  Regulations \nImplementing Title IX. \n \n32.  Following Title IX’s passage, Congress recognized that more guidance was necessary. \nCongress therefore passed what is known as the “Javits Amendment” in 1974. That amendment \nrequired the Department’s predecessor to promulgate regulations to effectuate Title IX, including \nregulations “with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions considering the \nnature of particular sports.” Pub. L. No. 93-380, Title VIII, Part D, § 844, 88 Stat. 612.1  \n33.  In compliance with that statutory mandate, the Department’s predecessor published \nregulations implementing Title IX (the “1975 Regulations”) on June 4, 1975. See U.S. Dep’t of Health, \nEduc., & Welfare, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex Under Federally Assisted Education Programs and \nActivities, 40 Fed. Reg. 24,128 (Jun. 4, 1975) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 86). \n34.  Congress subjected the 1975 Regulations to a statutory “laying before” provision, \nunder  which  Congress  could  disapprove  them  by  resolution  within  45  days  if  it  found  them \ninconsistent with Title IX. See General Education Provisions Act, Pub. L. 93-380, 88 Stat. 567.  \n35.  During that time period for congressional review, “[r]esolutions of disapproval were \nintroduced in both Houses of Congress” and discussed. N. Haven, 456 U.S. at 532 & n.22. One House \nsubcommittee “held six days of hearings to determine whether the [1975 Regulations] were ‘consistent \nwith the law and with the intent of the Congress in enacting the law.’” Id. at 532. Ultimately, the \nresolutions failed, and the 1975 Regulations went into effect. Id. at 533.  \n36.  Given the special congressional scrutiny that the 1975 Regulations endured, the \nSupreme Court has repeatedly “recognized the probative value” of the 1975 Regulations in light of \n“Title IX’s unique post enactment history.” Grove City Coll. v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 567 (1984). \n                                                 \n1 The Department was created in 1979 through the Department of Education Organization Act, and \nit formally adopted and recodified the 1975 Regulations without substantive changes when it began \noperations in 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. 30,802, 30,955–65 (May 9, 1980) (codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106). \n9  \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 11 of 43 PageID #:  11\n \n37.  The 1975 Regulations provide that, “[e]xcept as provided elsewhere . . . no person \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education \nprogram or activity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance.” 40 Fed. Reg. \nat 24,140 (now 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)) (emphasis added).  \n38.  Provisions throughout the 1975 Regulations emphasize three key aspects of Title IX’s \ngeneral prohibition on discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities.  \n39.  First, the 1975 Regulations demonstrate that sex discrimination means discrimination \nagainst someone based on his or her sex as a male or female. The 1975 Regulations thus referred to \n“women and men” and “male and female teams,” id. at 24,132, 24,135, contrasted payment rates \nbetween “one sex” and the “opposite sex,” id. at 24,135, and prohibited discrimination “against \nmembers of either sex,” id. at 24,134. \n40.  Second, the 1975 Regulations underscore that not all differential treatment based on sex \nis prohibited discrimination. That is why the 1975 Regulations permit funding recipients to “separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex” as long as “such facilities provided for \nstudents of one sex” are “comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” Id. at \n24,141. That is also why the regulations allow the “separation of students by sex within physical \neducation classes or activities during participation in wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, \nbasketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.” Id. And \nit is why they allow “[p]ortions of classes in elementary and secondary schools which deal exclusively \nwith human sexuality” to be “conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.” Id.  \n41.  Third,  the  1975  Regulations  show  that  sometimes  biological  differences  make \ndifferential treatment based on sex necessary to provide equal opportunities. That is why the 1975 \nRegulations “requir[e] the use of standards for measuring skill . . . in physical education which do not \n10   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 12 of 43 PageID #:  12\n \nimpact adversely on members of one sex.” Id. at 24,132; see id. (explaining this requirement is necessary \nbecause certain standards “may be virtually out-of-reach for many more women than men because of \nthe difference in strength between the average person of each sex”); see also id. at 24,141 (now 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.43) (“Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class \nhas an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards which do \nnot have such effect.”).  \n42.  Subsequent interpretations and regulations likewise carry forward these three features \nof Title IX. See, e.g., Dep’t of Health, Educ., & Welfare, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; a \nPolicy Interpretation; Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,414 (Dec. 11, 1979) \n(“athletic  interests  and  abilities  of  male  and  female  students  must  be  equally  effectively \naccommodated”); id. (explaining that most institutions would be obligated to develop “athletic \nprograms that substantially expand opportunities for women to participate and compete at all levels”); \nid. at 71,415 (“Some aspects of athletic programs may not be equivalent for men and women because \nof unique aspects of particular sports or athletic activities.”); Dep’t of Educ., Establishment of Title and \nChapters, 45 Fed. Reg. 30,802, 30,960 (May 9, 1980) (discussing “[h]ousing provided by a recipient to \nstudents of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex”). \n43.  Title IX and the early implementing regulations, not to mention current regulations,2 \nthus evince Congress’s policy decision to promote equal educational opportunities for both sexes \nwhile not disregarding biological differences or mandating identical treatment of males and females in \nall circumstances—a decision that has proven enormously successful as (among many other things) \nfemale college attendance and participation in athletics has skyrocketed. See, e.g., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)-(c) (allowing single-sex teams and requiring recipients to provide “equal \nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes”). \n11   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 13 of 43 PageID #:  13\n \nSt.  Johns  Cnty.,  57  F.4th  791,  818–19  (11th  Cir.  2022)  (Lagoa,  J.,  concurring)  (describing  the \n“remarkable impact Title IX has had on girls and women in sports”). \nII.  ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICATION OF TITLE IX \nA.  Title  IX  Is  Enforced  Through  Administrative  Enforcement  Proceedings  and \nLitigation. \n44.  Through OCR, the Department enforces Title IX and regulations by, among other \nthings, investigating discrimination complaints and seeking voluntary measures to cure violations. \nInvestigations impose costs and burdens on funding recipients, as do compliance measures. \n45.  If a recipient of federal funds fails or refuses to comply with Title IX or Title IX \nregulations, Defendants can pursue administrative enforcement proceedings or refer the matter to the \nU.S. Department of Justice for litigation. See Title IX Legal Manual, V. Federal Funding Agency \nMethods  to  Enforce  Compliance,  Civil  Rights  Division,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Justice,  available  at \nhttps://tinyurl.com/byjsscde. Both impose costs and can culminate in the termination of federal \nfunding. See id. \n46.  The threat of terminating federal funding is a powerful tool because the Department \nprovides funding to public K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, as well as most private higher \neducational institutions. \n47.  In addition to Defendants’ enforcement options, private individuals can also enforce \nTitle IX and regulations through private litigation. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 680 \n(1979) (holding Title IX contains an implied private right of action and a woman could sue medical \nschools for denying her admission due to her sex). \nB.  The Department and the Supreme Court Find that Harassment Can Violate Title \nIX  When  It  Is  Based  on  Sex  and  Effectively  Bars  Access  to  Educational \nOpportunities. \n \n48.  Since the 1980s, the Department has taken the position that sexual harassment can be \na form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights, \n12   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 14 of 43 PageID #:  14\n \nPolicy Mem., Antonio J. Califa, Director for Litigation Enforcement and Policy Services (Aug. 31, \n1981). \n49.  The Department stated that sexual harassment can severely interfere with a student’s \neducation,  not  to  mention  general  well-being,  and  emphasized  the  importance  of  ensuring \n“nondiscriminatory, safe environments in which students can learn.” Sexual Harassment Guidance: \nHarassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034, 12,034 \n(Mar. 13, 1997). \n50.  While acknowledging the seriousness of sexual harassment and attempting to remedy \nthat discrimination, the Department also recognized the danger to Free Speech rights if recipients did \nnot properly distinguish between prohibited conduct and protected free speech. It therefore issued \nguidance stating that “Title IX is intended to protect students from sex discrimination, not to regulate \nthe content of speech.” Id. at 12,045. It also admonished schools to “formulate, interpret, and apply \n[Title IX’s] rules so as to protect academic freedom and free speech rights.” Id. \n51.  The Supreme Court has also concluded that sexual harassment of a student can be \ndiscrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that violates Title IX (and creates \nliability in private damages suits) in certain circumstances. See Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 63–64, 75 (1992) (describing a teacher’s sexual harassment of a student on school property). \nIt has clarified that funding recipients violate Title IX when they have “actual knowledge” of a \nteacher’s  sexual  harassment  of  a  student  and  respond  with  “deliberate  indifference”  to  that \ndiscrimination. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998). \n52.  When it comes to student-on-student sexual harassment, a recipient violates Title IX \nwhen that harassment “is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the \nvictim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit” and “the funding recipient acts with \ndeliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.” Davis v. Monroe \n13   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 15 of 43 PageID #:  15\n \nCounty Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999). The Supreme Court explained that liability is limited \n“to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the \ncontext in which the known harassment occurs,” otherwise it cannot be said that the recipient caused \nthe victim to undergo the sex-based harassment “‘under’ the recipient’s programs.” Id. at 645. \n53.  The discriminatory conduct in Davis involved more than verbal conduct, so the \nmajority opinion did not need to address First Amendment concerns. See id. at 653. The dissent in \nDavis, however, noted that attempts to curb allegedly harassing speech could run afoul of the First \nAmendment. See id. at 667 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  \nIII.  RECENT EXECUTIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS \nA.  In 2016, the Department Unsuccessfully Attempted to Change the Meaning of \n“Sex” in Title IX.  \n54.  Recently, the Department dramatically departed from the plain meaning of Title IX, \nits own longstanding positions, and decades of precedent.  \n55.  In May 2016, OCR and the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice \nissued a “Dear Colleague” letter that adopted a radical definition of the term “sex” in Title IX. U.S. \nDep’t  of  Educ.,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Dear  Colleague  Letter,  May  13,  2016,  at \n1, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf \n(“2016 Dear Colleague Letter”). \n56.  That letter instructed schools and universities that the Department would “treat a \nstudent’s  gender  identity  as  the  student’s  sex  for  purposes  of  Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulations” and referred to gender identity as an “internal sense of gender” that “may be different \nfrom or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth.” Id. at 1–2. That instruction had dramatic \nramifications. To retain federal funding under the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, State recipients would \nhave to allow males who claim that they are female to use women’s restrooms and locker rooms, play \non women’s teams, and participate in the girls-only sex-education classes. Id. at 3–4.  \n14   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 16 of 43 PageID #:  16\n \n57.  For  obvious  reasons,  22  States,  including Louisiana,  filed  lawsuits  to  block  the \nDepartment and other federal defendants from implementing and enforcing the 2016 Dear Colleague \nLetter. See Compl., Texas et al. v. United States et al., No. 7:16-cv-00051 (N.D. Tex. May 25, 2016); \nCompl., Nebraska et al. v. United States et al., No. 4:16-cv-03117 (D. Neb. July 8, 2016). \n58.  A district court promptly enjoined enforcement of the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter, \nTexas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 836 (N.D. Tex. 2016), and the Department (under a new \nAdministration) rescinded the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter shortly thereafter, see U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nOffice  for  Civil  Rights,  Dear  Colleague  Letter,  Feb.  22,  2017, \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf.  \nB.  In  2020,  the  Department  Issued  Title  IX  Regulations  Addressing  Sexual \nHarassment and Grievance Procedures.  \n \n59.  On May 19, 2020, the Department published Title IX regulations primarily focused \non sexual harassment and grievance procedures. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis \nof Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, \n2020) (“2020 Regulations”).  \n60.  The 2020 Regulations were designed to “obligate recipients to respond promptly and \nsupportively to persons alleged to be victimized by sexual harassment, resolve allegations of sexual \nharassment promptly and accurately under a predictable, fair grievance process that provides due \nprocess protections to alleged victims and alleged perpetrators of sexual harassment, and effectively \nimplement remedies for victims.” Id. \n61.  Recognizing that alleged sexual harassment can involve verbal and expressive conduct \nthat raises potential First Amendment concerns, the 2020 Regulations adopted the Davis formulation \nof sexual harassment for “purely verbal harassment.” Id. at 30,142. Accordingly, it considered verbal \nharassment to constitute sex discrimination for Title IX purposes when it “is so severe, pervasive, and \n15   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 17 of 43 PageID #:  17\n \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.” Id. at 30,141; see id. \nat 30,033. The 2020 Regulations also defined sexual harassment to expressly include “quid pro quo \nharassment and Clery Act/[Violence Against Women Act] sex offenses.” Id. at 30,033. For quid pro \nquo sexual harassment and sexual assault, the 2020 Regulations imposed no similar severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive requirement, reasoning that “prohibiting such conduct presents no First \nAmendment concerns” and “such serious misconduct causes denial of equal educational access.” Id.  \n62.  The 2020 Rule also tracked Supreme Court precedent in other ways, including by \nrecognizing that recipients violate Title IX only when they have “actual knowledge” of sexual \nharassment and are deliberately indifferent to it. Id. at 30,033–34. \nC.  In 2021, the Department Again Unsuccessfully Attempted to Change the Meaning \nof “Sex” in Title IX.  \n63.  After the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), \nthe Department (under the Biden Administration) again tried to redefine the meaning of “sex” for \npurposes of Title IX. \n64.  In January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order citing Bostock and declaring \nthat Title IX likely “prohibit[s] discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation” \nunless it “contain[s] sufficient indications to the contrary.” Executive Order 13988, Preventing and \nCombating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023, 7023 (Jan. \n25, 2021). The order declared that “[i]t is the policy of [the Biden] Administration to prevent and \ncombat discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation” and that agency heads \nshould take action to implement that policy. Id. at 7023–24.  \n65.  In March 2021, President Biden issued another executive order that reaffirmed his \nAdministration’s policy regarding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \nSee Executive Order 14021, Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of \n16   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 18 of 43 PageID #:  18\n \nSex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803, 13,803 (Mar. 11, 2021). The order \nalso instructed the Secretary of Education specifically to take action to implement that policy. See id.   \n66.  Just a few months later, Defendants advanced a new interpretation of Title IX.  \n67.  On June 22, 2021, the Department issued a notice of “interpretation” of Title IX. See \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination \nBased on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 \n(June 22, 2021) (“2021 Interpretation”). \n68.  In the 2021 Interpretation, the Department announced that it now “interprets Title \nIX’s prohibition on discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ to encompass discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation and gender identity.” Id. at 32,637. It further announced that OCR would “fully \nenforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.” Id. at \n32,639.  \n69.  The very next day, on June 23, 2021, the Department released a “Dear Educator” letter \nnotifying educators of the 2021 Interpretation and its plans to “fully enforce” its new interpretation. \nSee  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Office  for  Civil  Rights,  Dear  Educator  Letter,  Jun.  23,  2021, \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-202106-\ntix.pdf. The letter also provided links to new guidance documents from OCR and the Department of \nJustice that “provide examples of the kind of incidents” that the Department can investigate. See id. at \n2. The examples demonstrated that Defendants would investigate recipients for a Title IX violation \nbased on students’ refusal to use a classmate’s “preferred pronouns.” See U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families, \navailable at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-factsheet-tix-202106.pdf. \n70.  Once again, States, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho, sued to \nchallenge the Department’s unlawful rewriting of Title IX. See Complaint, State of Tenn., et al. v. U.S. \n17   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 19 of 43 PageID #:  19\n \nDep’t of Educ., Case No. 3:21-cv-00308 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 30, 2021). And, once again, the States secured \nan injunction that prevented Defendants from enforcing their erroneous interpretation of Title IX \nagainst the States. See Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 842 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). \nD. In 2022, the Department Issued a Proposed Rule that Would Redefine “Sex” and \nWhen Harassment Constitutes Sex Discrimination under Title IX. \n71.  On July 12, 2022, the Department published a proposed rule that preceded the Final \nRule that is challenged in this lawsuit. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022) \n(“Proposed Rule”).  \n72.  In the Proposed Rule, the Department rejected the longstanding, ordinary meaning of \n“sex” and proposed to redefine discrimination “on the basis of sex” to mean “discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and \ngender identity.” Id. at 41,571. \n73.  Where “Title IX or the regulations permit different treatment or separation on the \nbasis of sex,” the Department proposed to prohibit recipients from doing so in a manner that \n“subject[s] a person to more than de minimis harm, unless otherwise permitted.” Id. at 41,571. The \nProposed Rule declares that “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a policy that prevents a person from \nparticipating in an education program or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects \na person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex.” Id. at 41,571. \n74.  In other words, the Department proposed, among other things, prohibiting single-sex \nbathrooms and locker rooms. That is because a recipient would be required to allow a male who claims \nto be a female to use girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms—otherwise the recipient would subject that \nstudent to “more than de minimis harm” that constitutes sex discrimination under the Proposed Rule. \nSee id. at 41,534.  \n18   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 20 of 43 PageID #:  20\n \n75.  These provisions of the Proposed Rule have implications for the fate of girls’ and \nwomen’s teams at any schools that receive federal funding: Under the logic of the Proposed Rule, \nwomen’s and girls’ sports teams will cease. That reality—and the political fallout of that result—is why \nthe Proposed Rule purports to defer the question of athletics to a separate rulemaking. See id. at 41,537. \n76.  The Department also proposed to jettison the 2020 Regulations’ definition of sexual \nharassment that drew from the Supreme Court’s decision in Davis, failing to properly account for the \ndifferences between verbal and physical conduct. See id. at 41,569. This, combined with the Proposed \nRule’s redefinition of “sex,” would require schools to police and curtail a whole host of protected free \nspeech. \n77.  What is more, the Proposed Rule creates additional constitutional problems, departs \nfrom the statute in other ways, and would have serious detrimental harm on recipients, teachers, \nstudents, and society at large.  \n78.  Given all the Proposed Rule’s flaws, it is no surprise that the Department received \n240,203 comments about the Proposed Rule. \nE.  The Department Proposed a Title IX Rule Specifically Related to Athletics in 2023. \n79.  In April 2023, the Department issued a proposed rule regarding its regulation of sex-\nseparated athletic teams under Title IX. See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male \nand Female Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (Apr. 13, 2023) (“Proposed Athletics Rule”). \n80.  The Department stated that “the purpose of this regulatory action . . . is to propose a \nregulatory standard under Title IX that would govern a recipient’s adoption or application of sex-\nrelated criteria that would limit or deny a student’s eligibility to participate on a male or female athletic \nteam consistent with their gender identity.” Id. at 22,860. \n19   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 21 of 43 PageID #:  21\n \n81.  It then proposed amending Title IX regulations to impose burdens on recipients that \ndesire to maintain girls-only and boys-only athletic teams and would require recipients to (1) allow \nboys who claim to be girls to play on some girls’ teams and (2) allow girls who claim to be boys to \nplay on some boys’ teams. Specifically, the Proposed Athletics Rule provides: \nIf a recipient adopts or applies sex-related criteria that would limit or deny a student’s \neligibility to participate on a male or female athletic team consistent with their gender \nidentity,  those  criteria  must,  for  each  sport, level of competition, and grade or \neducation level:  \n(i)  be  substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  an  important  educational \nobjective, and  \n(ii)  minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or \nfemale team consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. \n  \nId. at 22,891. \n82.  Despite the significance of the Proposed Athletics Rule and the incredibly damaging \nimpact it would likely have on women’s sports and female participation in athletics, the Department \nprovided only a month for the public to comment. Id. at 22,860.  \nIV.  THE FINAL RULE \n83.  Fast forward to today: On April 29, 2024, the Department published the Final Rule, \nwhich redefines “sex” in Title IX to embrace “gender identity” (and other concepts that are distinct \nfrom sex) and still purports to leave the politically nuclear topic of sports—and whether single-sex \nteams are permissible—for another day. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. \n84.  The Department cites “its authority to issue rules effectuating [Title IX’s] prohibition \non sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the statute.” Id. at 33,476 (citing 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1682). Yet the Rule upends the entire Title IX framework, beginning with redefining what Title IX’s \ngeneral prohibition against discrimination on the basis of “sex” means. \n85.  Although 20 U.S.C. § 1681 prohibits funding recipients from subjecting a person “to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity” based on “sex,” the Rule expands Title IX to \ninclude “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \n20   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 22 of 43 PageID #:  22\n \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” Id. These other grounds are not interchangeable \nwith sex. A recipient that treats a person differently based on some of these grounds does not always \ndiscriminate against that person based on sex. And, as explained above, Title IX at times warrants and \neven demands recognizing and respecting differences between the sexes. Disregarding the differences \nbetween “sex” and, for example, “gender identity” (whatever that means) thus creates particular \nproblems and inconsistencies within Title IX and the Rule itself.  \n86.  The Rule fails to define “gender identity,” but the Department “understands” it to \nmean “an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned \nat birth.” Id. at 33,809. Couched in those capacious terms, discrimination based on gender identity is \nnecessarily different than discrimination based on sex.  \n87.  Nevertheless, the Rule treats gender identity as synonymous with sex in certain \nscenarios. For example, the Rule requires recipients of federal funds to allow persons to use whichever \nsingle-sex bathroom or locker room corresponds with their claimed gender identity at that time. See \nid. at 33,818 (denying “a transgender student access to a sex-separate facility or activity consistent with \nthat student’s gender identity . . . would violate Title IX’s general nondiscrimination mandate”); id. at \n33,818 (agreeing that “students experience sex-based harm that violates Title IX when a recipient bars \nthem from accessing sex-separate facilities or activities consistent with their gender identity”); id. (“a \nrecipient must provide access to sex-separate facilities, including bathrooms, in a manner that does \nnot cause more than de minimis harm”); id. at 33,887 (providing that failing to treat a person \n“consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the \nbasis of sex”).3 So under the Rule, every elementary school, middle school, high school, and university \n                                                 \n3 The Rule provides no meaningful guidance on how to deal with persons who do not identify with \neither the male or female sex. See id. at 33,818 (noting the Rule does “not specify how a recipient must \nprovide access to sex-separate facilities for students who do not identify as male or female” and \nsuggesting a recipient may “coordinate with the student . . . to best provide the student with safe and \n21   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 23 of 43 PageID #:  23\n \nthat receives federal funding is prohibited from having single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms. This, \nof course, conflicts with Title IX and the earliest regulations that recognized having single-sex facilities \nlike bathrooms, locker rooms, and dormitories is not prohibited sex discrimination.  \n88.  The Rule gives recipients—along with students and staff—no measures to prevent this \nrequirement (that people be treated consistently with their claimed gender identity) from being abused. \nIndeed, the Rule suggests recipients cannot impose documentation requirements, such as requiring a \ndiagnosis of gender dysphoria (previously referred to as gender identity disorder), without causing \nprohibited “more than de minimis harm.” Id. at 33,819. And the Rule warns that persons cannot be \nharassed based on gender identity when “access[ing] sex-separate facilities.” Id. at 33,818; see id. at \n33,516 (“unwelcome conduct based on gender identity can create a hostile environment when it \notherwise  satisfies  the  definition  of  sex-based  harassment”);  id.  at  33,884  (defining  sex-based \nharassment to include “other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the bases described [in the \nexpanded scope of Title IX discrimination in § 106.10]”).  \n89.  The Rule issues that warning because even comments questioning whether a person \nbelongs in a certain bathroom could be prohibited harassment under the Rule. See, e.g., id. at 33,516 \n(“harassing a student—including acts of verbal . . . aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on the \nstudent’s nonconformity with stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity or gender identity—\n                                                 \nnondiscriminatory access to facilities”). But to the extent the Rule treats “sex” and “gender identity” \nas synonymous, a recipient may violate the Rule if it provides single-sex bathrooms for males and \nfemales but declines to provide a single-sex bathroom that corresponds specifically with a multitude \nof gender identities. See id. at 33,816 (noting that “there are stigmatic injuries, associated with treating \nindividuals differently on the basis of sex, and in such circumstances, no additional showing of a more \n‘material’ harm is required under Title IX”); What Are the 72 Other Genders?, MedicineNet (medically \nreviewed  on  Feb.  9,  2024), \nhttps://www.medicinenet.com/what_are_the_72_other_genders/article.htm (explaining that there \nare 72 other genders “[b]eside male and female,” and “[t]he idea is to make everyone feel comfortable \nin their skin regardless of what gender they were assigned at birth”). \n \n22   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 24 of 43 PageID #:  24\n \ncan constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX in certain circumstances”); id. (“a one-\noff remark . . . alone may not be severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile environment, but if \nmultiple peers repeatedly call the student ‘girly,’ that same treatment may create a hostile environment \nfor that student”). \n90.  Such questioning is prohibited under the Rule because, along with redefining what \n“sex” means in Title IX, the Rule dramatically expands the 2020 Regulations’ “sexual harassment” \ndefinition (which it terms “sex-based harassment”) beyond what the text of Title IX can bear. Id. at \n33,884.  \n91.  Under the Rule, “sex-based harassment” is harassment based on any of the “bases \ndescribed in § 106.10,” id. at 33,884—that is, “sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender  identity,”  id.  at  33,886—and  is  “a  form  of  sex \ndiscrimination” that includes “hostile environment harassment.” Id. at 33,884. The Rule then defines \nhostile environment harassment as “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity \n(i.e., creates a hostile environment).” Id.  \n92.  In other words, speech expressing critical views about the concept of gender identity—\nincluding views that are mainstream, widely shared, and legitimate—could be prohibited sex-based \nharassment under the Rule even if it is not “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \neffectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 633.  \n93.  Even comments not directed toward a person can give rise to “a complaint of sex-\nbased harassment” under the Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,654 (“[A] person who witnesses an incident \nthat creates a hostile environment for them may make a complaint on their own behalf.”). And much \nprotected First Amendment speech would be viewed as sex-based harassment under the Rule. See, e.g., \n23   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 25 of 43 PageID #:  25\n \nid. at 33,570 (“academic discourse of students or teachers generally would not meet this standard” \n(emphasis added)); id. at 33,516 (discussing “unwelcome conduct based on gender identity” and citing \nU.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Discrimination, \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/sexualorientation-and-gender-identity-sogidiscrimination  (“SOGI  Guidance”));  see  also \nSOGI Guidance (“Harassment can also include, for example, offensive or derogatory remarks about \na person’s transgender status or gender transition. Although accidental misuse of a transgender \nemployee’s name and pronouns does not violate Title VII, intentionally and repeatedly using the \nwrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender employee could contribute to an unlawful hostile \nwork environment.”).  \n94.  Indeed, the Rule would compel students and teachers to use whatever pronouns a \nperson demands, see, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516, which creates conflicts with Free Speech and Free \nExercise rights, see, e.g., Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 511–12 (6th Cir. 2021).  \n95.  Similarly, the Rule will lead to the infringement of parental rights and will create Due \nProcess concerns. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,596–97 (noting that even where the Title IX coordinator \ndefers to the parent about whether to file a complaint, “the Title IX Coordinator may still be required \nto, as necessary, take other steps,” such as training about harassment); id. at 33,821–22 (refusing to \nanswer “whether a recipient should comply with a request by a minor student to change their name \nor pronouns used at school if their parent opposes the change”); id. at 33,597 (allowing a Title IX \nCoordinator  to  override  a  parent’s  wishes  “with  respect  to  that  parent’s  child”  based  on  the \ncoordinator’s judgment about potential harm); id. at 33,537 (emphasizing that, “[t]o the extent that a \nconflict exists between a recipient’s obligations under Title IX and under FERPA [the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act], § 106.6(e) [of the Rule] expressly states that the obligation to \ncomply with the Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by the FERPA statute or regulations” \nand “that a recipient must not use FERPA as a shield from compliance with Title IX”); id. at 33,893 \n24   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 26 of 43 PageID #:  26\n \n(requiring recipients to use a “preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to determine whether \nsex discrimination occurred, unless the recipient uses the clear and convincing evidence standard of \nproof in all other comparable proceedings”).  \n96.  The Rule accordingly makes it impossible for recipients to avoid liability. If recipients \ncomply with the Rule, they will face private lawsuits alleging they violated constitutional rights. And, \nif they fail to comply with the Rule or inadequately comply with the Rule, recipients will face Title IX \ninvestigations and enforcement actions and private lawsuits alleging Title IX violations. \n97.  The  Rule’s  redefinition  of  “sex”  and  dramatic  expansion  of  what  constitutes \nprohibited  discrimination  thus  not  only  departs  from  Title  IX’s  text  and  purpose,  but  it  also \nsubstantially increases a funding recipient’s liability risk and Title IX obligations. See, e.g., id. at 33,563 \n(“the recipient need not have incontrovertible proof that conduct violates Title IX for it to have an \nobligation to respond,” but rather “if the conduct reasonably may be sex discrimination, the recipient \nmust respond in accordance with § 106.44” (emphasis added)). \n98.  Other aspects of the Rule also increase a recipient’s obligations and potential liability, \neither independently or in conjunction with other portions of the Rule, in a way that is contrary to \nTitle IX and arbitrary and capricious. See, e.g., id. at 33,888 (requiring all non-confidential employees at \nelementary  or  secondary  schools  “to  notify  the Title IX Coordinator when the employee has \ninformation about conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination” under the Rule); id. at \n33,548 (imposing extensive training requirements and acknowledging that the Rule “will require \nrecipients’ time and effort to update training materials and conduct additional training”); id. at 33,563 \n(“Some of the recipient’s duties under § 106.44 arise when the Title IX Coordinator has knowledge \nof conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination, but the recipient also has duties before \nsuch an occurrence.”); id. at 33,567 (noting that “the obligation to monitor for barriers to reporting is \nnot triggered only when a concern is raised over barriers to reporting,” but rather “[t]he Title IX \n25   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 27 of 43 PageID #:  27\n \nCoordinator must monitor for barriers regardless of whether a concern has been raised about such \nbarriers”); id. at 33,598 (“When the Title IX Coordinator is notified of conduct that reasonably may \nconstitute sex discrimination and does not initiate a complaint, the Title IX Coordinator must take \nother appropriate prompt and effective steps to ensure that sex discrimination does not continue or \nrecur within the recipient’s education program or activity.”); id. at 33,682 (“Conduct that occurs under \na recipient’s education program or activity includes but is not limited to conduct that occurs in a \nbuilding owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary \ninstitution and conduct that is subject to the recipient’s disciplinary authority.”); id. at 33,869 (“In \nsome instances, such as when an alleged incident occurred outside of the United States and may have \ncontributed to a sex-based hostile environment under the recipient’s education program or activity \ndomestically, the Department acknowledges that the  resulting  investigation  may  be  more  time \nconsuming.”). \n99.  Finally, the Rule pretends that its dramatic overhaul of Title IX will have no impact \non whether it is permissible for schools to have separate athletic teams for women and girls. See id. at \n33,817 (“Until the [Proposed Athletic Rule] is finalized and issued, the current regulations on athletics \ncontinue to apply.”). But that cannot be right since the Rule takes the position that treating someone \nconsistent with his or her biological sex when they claim to be of the opposite sex constitutes more \nthan de minimis harm and sex discrimination. See, e.g., id. at 33,815, 33,887. That logic means that, in \nat least some circumstances, recipients would be required to allow males to play on female-only teams \nto comply with the Rule’s interpretation of Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination. And that \nposition is entirely unsurprising because it is the same position this Administration has urged federal \ncourts to adopt. See also Brief of U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Civil Rights Division, B.P.J. v. West Va. State Bd. \nof Educ., No. 23-1078, ECF No. 68-1 at 12–13 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2023) (arguing that categorically \nprohibiting boys who claim a female gender identity from “participating on girls’ sports teams because \n26   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 28 of 43 PageID #:  28\n \ntheir sex assigned at birth was male . . . discriminates on the basis of sex”); id. at 21–29. The \nDepartment’s attempt to run away from the topic of sports now can thus be explained only by the \nreality  that  the  Department  understands  its  position—if  expressly  promulgated  in  the  Federal \nRegister—would be political suicide in an election year. \n100.  The Rule is contrary to law, exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority, and is arbitrary \nand capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The Rule also imposes conditions \nin violation of the Spending Clause and is an unlawful exercise of legislative power. What is more, \nDefendants violated the APA’s procedural requirements by not providing a meaningful opportunity \nto comment on the Rule. \nV.  THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF THE FINAL RULE \n101.  Because the Rule disregards and effectively rewrites the statutory text, its issuance \nundermines our Nation’s constitutional structure and flouts the democratic will of the people as \nreflected in Title IX and duly enacted state laws that conflict with the Rule.   \n102.  In addition, the Rule subverts Title IX’s purpose and will particularly harm the precise \npopulation that Title IX was meant to help most—women and girls, who will now face increased \nthreats to privacy and safety, not to mention will lose spots on sports teams and podiums. See Adams, \n57 F.4th at 819–21 (Lagoa, J., concurring). \n103.  If that were not enough, the Rule will trample Free Speech and Free Exercise rights \nof students and teachers, “prescrib[ing] what shall be orthodox” and “forc[ing] citizens to confess by \nword or act their faith therein.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). Under \nthe Rule, a funding recipient would risk Title IX enforcement proceedings or private liability if it failed \nto take action when a student or teacher fails to use biologically inaccurate pronouns or expresses a \nbelief that Genesis 1:27 is true. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516; SOGI Guidance (characterizing “misuse” \nof pronouns as an example of harassment).  \n27   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 29 of 43 PageID #:  29\n \n104.  The Rule also causes direct, immediate, and ongoing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, \nincluding by subjecting them to increased regulatory burdens, exposing them to litigation risks, and \noverriding state laws on matters of traditional state authority.  \n105.  Because  each  Plaintiff  State  and  its  elementary  schools,  secondary  schools,  and \npostgraduate schools receive federal funding from the Department, Plaintiff States are subject to the \nRule. And the Rule itself recognizes this: “[A]ll 50 States have accepted Federal funding for educational \nprograms or activities and are subject to Title IX as to those programs and activities,” and the Rule \n“appl[ies] to all recipients of Federal financial assistance,” including “State educational agencies.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,490, 33,541; 33,634.  \n106.  That means each Plaintiff is “an object of [the] regulation” and suffers an “increased \nregulatory burden” as a direct result of the Rule. See Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 779 \nF.3d 258, 266 (5th Cir. 2015); see also Career Colleges & Sch. of Tex. v. United States Dep't of Educ., 98 F.4th \n220, 234 (5th Cir. 2024).  \n107.  Indeed, the Rule even concedes “all regulated entities will experience an increased \nrecordkeeping burden under the final regulations,” acknowledges “recipients would be required to \naddress more complaints,” projects “a 10 percent increase in the number of investigations conducted \nannually,” and admits it “could result in increased costs to recipients.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,881, 33,492, \n33,850, 33,877. \n108.  Even putting increased costs to one side, the Rule injures States and their educational \nagencies by forcing them into a lose-lose situation: (1) comply with an unlawful bureaucratic rewrite \nof Title IX with which they do not wish to comply or (2) lose billions of dollars of federal funding for \ntheir students. \n109.  Louisiana and its local programs received at least $2,425,330,125 of funding from the \nDepartment last year and is projected to receive at least $ 2,545,336,326 this year. See Funds for State \n28   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 30 of 43 PageID #:  30\n \nFormula-Allocated  and  Selected  Student  Aid  Programs,  by  State,  available  at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/statetables/index.html; see also U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nFiscal  Years  2023-2025  State  Tables  of  the  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ., \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/statetables/index.html  (noting  the  tables  “do  not \nreflect all department funds that a State receives”).  \n110.  Mississippi and its local programs received at least $1,592,288,396 of funding from the \nDepartment last year and is projected to receive at least $ 1,678,255,514 this year. See Funds for State \nFormula-Allocated  and  Selected  Student  Aid  Programs,  by  State,  available  at \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/statetables/index.html. \n111.  Montana and its local programs received at least $496,757,925 of funding from the \nDepartment last year and is projected to receive at least $513,671,547 this year. See id. \n112.  Idaho and its local programs received at least $688,106,682 of funding from the \nDepartment last year and is projected to receive at least $734,895,238 this year. See id. \n113.  The Rule accordingly could deprive Plaintiff States and their educational systems of \nbillions of dollars of federal funding.  \n114.  The  Rule  also  harms  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Education  specifically.  The \nLouisiana Department is often the direct recipient of federal funds and retains a portion of the federal \nfunds for administrative costs. But in order to receive the funds, the Louisiana Department must sign \nan assurance that it will comply with Title IX and regulations issued under Title IX.  \n115.  In addition to hurting the Plaintiffs’ financial interests, the Rule also harms the Plaintiff \nStates’ sovereign interests, including by interfering with their authority over education in their State, \ntheir democratically enacted laws, and their future ability to legislate. See Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, \n603 n.17 (2018) (explaining a State’s “inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts \nirreparable harm”); Arizona v. Yellen, 34 F.4th 841, 845 (9th Cir. 2022) (concluding a State had standing \n29   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 31 of 43 PageID #:  31\n \nwhere it alleged “infringement on its authority to set tax policy and its interest in being free from \ncoercion impacting its tax policy”); W. Virginia v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1149 (11th \nCir. 2023) (concluding States “suffered irreparable harm” where a statutory provision allegedly \n“affected the States’ sovereign authority to tax”); BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (“The States, too, have an interest in seeing their constitutionally reserved police power \nover public health policy defended from federal overreach.”); Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. \n3d 807, 841 (E.D. Tenn. 2022) (concluding States “have sovereign interests in enforcing their duly \nenacted state laws” and plaintiff States “suffered an immediate injury” when the federal government \nissued guidance that conflicted with state law). \n116.  Louisiana enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act “to promote sex equality” by \n“providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities \nwhile also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition, accolades, scholarships, better \nphysical and mental health, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in \nathletic endeavors.” La. Rev. Stat. § 4:442(9). It accomplishes these goals, in part, by mandating that \nstate-funded schools’ “[a]thletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall \nnot be open to students who are not biologically female.” Id. § 4:444(B). \n117.  Mississippi law promotes sex equality by requiring all state “public primary” and \n“secondary school[s],” and all state schools that are “a member of the Mississippi State High School \nActivities Association,” “a public institution of higher learning,” or a “higher education institution \nthat is a member of the NCAA, NAIA, or NJCCA,” to “expressly designate[]” their “[i]nterscholastic \nor intramural athletic teams” and “sports” “based on biological sex.” Miss. Code Ann. § 37-97-1(1). \nMississippi law prohibits “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for ‘females,’ ‘women’ or ‘girls’” from \nallowing participation by “students of the male sex.” Id. § 37-97-1(2); see id. § 37-97-1(1)(a)-(c) \n(designations). In addition, all “government entit[ies],” “licensing or accrediting organization[s],” and \n30   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 32 of 43 PageID #:  32\n \n“athletic association[s] or organization[s]” are prohibited from “entertain[ing] a complaint, open[ing] \nan investigation, or tak[ing] any other adverse action against a primary or secondary school or \ninstitution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or \nsports for students of the female sex.” Id. § 37-97-3.  \n118.  Montana law defines the term “sex” as biological sex and specifically excludes the \nconcept of gender identity from the definition: \n[T]he organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings \nand other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, \nwith two corresponding types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological \nand genetic indication of male or female, including sex chromosomes, naturally \noccurring  sex  chromosomes,  gonads,  and  nonambiguous  internal  and  external \ngenitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual’s psychological, behavioral, \nsocial, chosen, or subjective experience of gender. \nMont Code. Ann. § 1-1-201(1)(f).  \n119.  In 2021, Montana enacted the “Save Women’s Sports Act.” See Mont. Code Ann. § 20-\n7-1306. That act requires athletic teams “sponsored by a public elementary or high school . . . or any \nschool or institution whose students or teams compete against a public school” to be “designated . . . \nbased on biological sex.” Id. § 1306(1). The Save Women’s Sports Act provides that “[a]thletic teams \nor sports designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male sex.” Id. \n§ 1306(2). The Save Women’s Sports Act defines “female,” “male,” and “sex” pursuant to Mont. \nCode. Ann. § 1-1-201(1)(f).    \n120.  Montana’s parental involvement in education law protects the rights of students and \nteachers who refuse to use biologically inaccurate pronouns. Montana requires that a parent “shall \nprovide written consent before the parent’s child uses a pronoun that does not align with the child’s \nsex.” Mont. Code. Ann. § 40-6-704(1)(f). “If a parent provides written consent . . . a person may not \nbe compelled to use pronouns that do not align with the child’s sex.” Id.  \n31   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 33 of 43 PageID #:  33\n \n121.  Idaho statutorily defines “sex” as “an individual’s biological sex, either male or \nfemale.” Idaho Code § 74-114(2)(n). That definition applies to all of Idaho’s laws “unless otherwise \napparent from the context.” Id. § 74-114(2). \n122.  Finding that there are “inherent differences between men and women” and that those \ndifferences “remain cause for celebration,” Idaho enacted the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act. The \nAct ensures “sex equality” by protecting “opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, \nstrength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition, \naccolades, scholarships, better physical and mental health, and the numerous other long-term benefits \nthat flow from success in athletic endeavors.” Idaho Code §§ 33-6201–6203. The Act requires that \nstate-funded school “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be \nopen to students of the male sex.” Id. § 33-6203. Although Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act \nis currently enjoined, Idaho continues to defend the law and is appealing the injunction. \n123.  Because “[e]very person has a natural right to privacy and safety in restrooms and \nchanging facilities,” Idaho also passed the Protecting the Privacy and Safety of Students in Public \nSchools Act to ensure that public school restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight accommodations \ncontinue to respect sex designations. Idaho Code §§ 33-6701–6707. Idaho Code § 33-6703 is presently \nenjoined on appeal, but Idaho continues to defend the law. \n124.  The Rule conflicts with all of the above laws, hampering Plaintiff States’ “ability to \nenforce their conflicting state laws” and placing “substantial pressure” on them to change their laws. \nTennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 821; see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (“The obligation to comply with Title IX \nand this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that conflicts \nwith Title IX or this part.”). \n32   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 34 of 43 PageID #:  34\n \n125.  The Rule also harms Plaintiff States by impeding their ability to enact and enforce \nfuture laws, including laws that are designed to safeguard women and girls and to safeguard parental \nrights.  \n126.  Indeed, the Rule conflicts with at least two such bills—the Women’s Safety and \nProtection Act and the Given Name Act—that are currently making their way through the Louisiana \nState Legislature. See H.B. 610, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (La. 2024); H.B. 121, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (La. \n2024). \n127.  The Rule similarly conflicts with at least two Mississippi bills—the Women’s Bill of \nRights and the SAFER Act—that are currently making their way through the state legislature. See H.B. \n1607, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2024); S.B. 2753, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2024). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nThe Rule Is Contrary to Law. \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.) \n128.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n129.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not \nin accordance with law” or is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n130.  Defendants may exercise only authority conferred by statute. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. OSHA, 142 S. Ct. 661, 665 (2022) (“Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They \naccordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.”).  \n131.  Title IX gives Defendants no authority to: (a) redefine terms like “sex” to include \nseparate concepts, such as “gender identity”; (b) prohibit protected speech based on an unsupportable \ndefinition of hostile environment harassment; (c) compel speech and commandeer recipients to police \n33   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 35 of 43 PageID #:  35\n \nemployee and student’s pronoun usage; or (d) override Title IX’s text in the myriad of ways the Rule \ndoes. And that is especially true in light of other statutory provisions that limit the Department’s ability \nto interfere with the rights of States and local governments on education. See 20 U.S.C. § 3403(a)–(b). \n132.  Defendants thus exceeded their statutory authority by issuing the Rule, which is \ncontrary to the text and structure of Title IX, is otherwise not in accordance with law, and is antithetical \nto the advancement of equal educational opportunities and the promotion of equal dignity and respect \nfor the two sexes that Title IX aims to promote.  \n133.  Indeed, the Rule would flip Title IX on its head by likely causing discrimination against \nwomen rather than prohibiting it: Among other things, women (a) will be deprived of equal athletic \nopportunities, (b) will be forced to accept claims about what makes a person a women that often rely \non sex stereotypes, and (c) will likely suffer increased sexual violence as a result of the Rule’s failure \nto provide any safeguards against sexual predators who will exploit the defects in the Rule by claiming \na female gender identity even if they do not suffer from gender dysphoria so that they can access \nwomen’s bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers.  \n134.  Defendants issued the Rule pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1682, which gives them no \nauthority to adopt regulations that subvert Title IX.  \n135.  What is more, Defendants would need to point to clear authority to issue the Rule \nbecause it decides major questions—including whether to treat claimed gender identity as biological \nsex—that must be decided by “Congress itself” or, at the very least, by “an agency acting pursuant to \na clear delegation from that representative body.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 735 (2022).  \n136.  The  Rule  answers  major  questions  that  belong  to  Congress  or  require  a  clear \nauthorization for at least four reasons. First, the Rule has enormous social and political significance. \nSee id. at 721. Second, the Rule has significant economic consequences. Third, the Rule is “novel” and \n“transformative,” and Congress “has consistently rejected proposals” to expand Title IX to prohibit \n34   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 36 of 43 PageID #:  36\n \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. See id. at 716, 725, 731–32. And fourth, \nthe Rule intrudes on areas of traditional state authority. See id. at 744 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n137.  Accordingly, the Department’s inability to point to clear congressional authority is yet \nanother reason the Rule is unlawful and must be set aside. \nCOUNT TWO \nSpending Clause Violation \n(U.S. Constitution, Article I, § 8, cl. 1) \n \n138.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n139.  The Constitution grants Congress the power to “to pay the Debts and provide for the \ncommon Defense and general Welfare of the United States.” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n140.  Incident to this power, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal \nfunds.” South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987). But the Supreme Court has recognized several \nrestrictions on this use of the Spending Clause power, including that: (1) conditions must be \n“unambiguous[]” so States can “exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \ntheir participation,” (2) conditions must be related to the “federal interest in the project,” (3) spending \nmust not “induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,” and \n(4) spending must not “be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.” \nId. at 207–11. \n141.  Because Title IX was passed under Congress’s power to impose conditions on federal \nfunds, see Davis, 526 U.S. at 640, the conditions that it and its implementing regulations impose must \ncomply with each restriction on the use of the Spending Clause power. The Rule’s conditions, \nhowever, flunk each of the four requirements described above. The Rule imposes conditions that: \n(1) are not “unambiguously” clear in Title IX, see B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078, 2024 \nWL 1627008, at *21–22 (4th Cir. Apr. 16, 2024) (Agee, J., dissenting); (2) are unrelated, if not contrary \n35   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 37 of 43 PageID #:  37\n \nto, the federal interest; (3) will induce recipients to violate the constitutional rights of students, \nemployees, and parents; and (4) impermissibly coerce Plaintiff States, violating their sovereignty, see \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 577–78, 582; id. at 589 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \n142.  Finally, even if the Rule accurately reflected Title IX (it does not), Plaintiffs have been \ndeprived of their right to “voluntarily and knowingly accept[] the terms of the ‘contract.’” Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Plaintiffs did not know that they would be forced \nto accept the obligations, liabilities, and other conditions the Rule imposes, see supra Part IV, when \nthey accepted federal funds and agreed not to discriminate in their education programs and activities \nbased on biological sex (with certain statutory exceptions).  \nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of Article I \n(U.S. Constitution, Article I, § 1) \n \n143.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n144.  The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted” to Congress. U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 1 (emphasis added). See, e.g., Forrest Gen. Hosp. v. Azar, 926 F.3d 221, 228 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(“The Constitution, after all, vests lawmaking power in Congress. How much lawmaking power? ‘All,’ \ndeclares the Constitution’s first substantive word.”); Philip Hamburger, Nondelegation Blues, 91 Geo. \nWash. L. Rev. 1083, 1141–42 (2023); Jed Handelsman Shugerman, Vesting, 74 Stanford L. Rev. 1479, \n1506, 1550–51 (2022). \n145.  Congress thus may not “abdicate or . . . transfer to others the essential legislative \nfunctions with which it is thus vested.” A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 \n(1935). Or, at the very least, Congress must provide “an intelligible principle” so it can be said that \n“the agency exercises only executive power.” Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 461 (5th Cir. 2022), cert. \ngranted, 143 S. Ct. 2688 (2023).  \n36   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 38 of 43 PageID #:  38\n \n146.  If Congress delegated the authority to issue the Rule to Defendants—which it did \nnot—that delegation violates Article I and separation-of-powers principles. The Rule embodies major \npolicy decisions that are “the very essence of legislative authority under our system” and “must be \nmade by the elected representatives of the people.” Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. API, 448 U.S. 607, \n687 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).  \n147.  Furthermore, if the directive that the Department effectuate Title IX’s “prohibition \non sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the statute,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,476, allows it \nto issue the Rule, which subverts the primary purpose of Title IX and undermines the consistency of \nthe statutory scheme, then that directive is not a true “intelligible principle.” See Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n461. \n148.  The Rule, if authorized by statute, is therefore an impermissible exercise of legislative \npower.  \nCOUNT FOUR \nThe Rule is Arbitrary, Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) \n149.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n150.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n151.  This means if an agency action is not “reasonable and reasonably explained,” it must \nbe set aside. Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1136 (5th Cir. 2021) \n(quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)); see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 224 (2016) (“[A] lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that is inconsistent with \nthe Department’s longstanding earlier position results in a rule that cannot carry the force of law.”).  \n37   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 39 of 43 PageID #:  39\n \n152.  An “agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). When an agency changes its position, the agency \nmust “recognize[] the change, reason[] through it without factual or legal error, and balance[], all \nrelevant interests affected by the change.” Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 469 (5th Cir. \n2024). \n153.  Moreover, an agency cannot “offer[] an explanation for its decision that runs counter \nto the evidence before the agency,” nor can it “fail[] to consider an important aspect of the problem.” \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43. And “bare acknowledgement” of a concern “is no substitute for \nreasoned consideration.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 473. Arbitrary-and-capricious review thus “has ‘serious \nbite.’” Id. at 470 (quoting Data Mktg. P’ship v. DOL, 45 F.4th 846, 856 (5th Cir. 2022)). \n154.  The Rule fails arbitrary-and-capricious review multiple times over. To summarize a \nfew flaws, the Rule is internally inconsistent, fails to define key terms, disregards evidence submitted, \nmakes decisions that are counter to the evidence before the Department, fails to properly balance all \nthe relevant interests that would be affected by the Department’s changed position, and routinely \noffers “conclusory statements” rather than real responses to valid and serious concerns submitted by \ncommenters. See id. at 473. \n155.  For  example,  the  Department  did  not  meaningfully  respond  to  “evidence  that \ntransgender students pose a safety risk to cisgender students”;4 instead, it simply states it “does not \n                                                 \n4 Cisgender is defined by some sources as “a person whose sense of personal identity corresponds to \nthe sex and gender assigned to him or her at birth (in contrast with transgender),” and the term “arose \nin  the  late  1990s.”  Katherine  Connor  Martin,  New  words  notes  June  2015, \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150814051905/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-\nupdates-to-the-oed/june-2015-update/new-words-notes-june-2015/. \n38   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 40 of 43 PageID #:  40\n \nagree.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820. The Department also fails to consider a related important aspect of the \nproblem: how to protect girls and prevent predators, who are not suffering from gender dysphoria, \nfrom exploiting the Rule.  \n156.  To take another example, the Rule’s cost-benefit analysis is wholly deficient. The Rule \nassumes the average time to read and understand the final, 423-page regulation will be 4 hours for a \nTitle IX Coordinator and lawyers. See id. at 33,867. This assumption defies belief, especially when the \nDepartment includes relevant details about recipients’ compliance obligations in the preamble. See, e.g., \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516, 33,812–13. The Rule’s other cost-and-benefit assumptions are equally absurd, \nincluding its failure to include any construction costs based on Defendants’ refusal to acknowledge \nthe Rule will require schools to modify bathrooms and locker rooms. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,876.  \n157.  The Rule’s pretense of leaving the athletics regulations undisturbed even though those \nregulations conflict with the Rule’s stated interpretation of Title IX likewise demonstrates the Rule is \nnot a product of reasoned decisionmaking. So too is the Rule’s refusal to provide any specific examples \nof how the new sex-based harassment standard would apply in relation to a student’s insistence that \nhis or her classmate use inaccurate pronouns—or insistence that classmates use “neopronouns” like \n“xe/xir/xirs, ze/zir/zirs, and fae/faer/faers.” See Understanding Neopronouns, Human Rights Campaign \n(last updated May 18, 2022), https://www.hrc.org/resources/understanding-neopronouns. \n158.  These examples are emblematic of the problems that run throughout the entire Rule. \n159.  It also shows the Rule’s outcome was improperly pre-determined and tainted by bias, \nwhich is further demonstrated by the 2021 Interpretation and Defendant Lhamon’s involvement in \nthe rulemaking process. See J. Dillon and S. Taylor Jr., Ending due process: Reinstating Catherine Lhamon at \nthe  Dept.  of  Education  is  a  mistake,  USA  Today  (June  14,  2021), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/06/14/catherine-lhamons-history-dept-education-\ntitle-ix-rape-sexual-assault/7675799002/. \n39   \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24   Page 41 of 43 PageID #:  41\n \nCOUNT FIVE \nWithout Observance of Procedure Required by Law \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) \n160.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n161.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n162.  The APA requires agencies to publish notice of all proposed rulemakings in a manner \nthat “give[s] interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission \nof written data, views, or arguments.” Id. § 553(c). \n163.  Because the Department did not provide the public with an opportunity to understand \nand comment on Proposed Rule in light of the subsequently issued Proposed Athletics Rule, it \ndeprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on these inseparable issues in defiance \nof APA requirements. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter an order and judgment \nthat grants the following relief, which it is authorized to do under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201, and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65: \na.

DOUGHTY \n \nU S DEPT OF EDUCATION ET AL  MAG. JUDGE KAYLA D. MCCLUSKY \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn April 29, 2024, the United States Department of Education issued the Final Rule, which \nredefined sexual discrimination in Title IX. Plaintiffs immediately filed suit in this Court followed \nby a request for this Court to issue a Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order \nagainst the Final Rule. \nIt is a tenant of this free country that harassment against any person, whether it be based \non their gender identity or sexual orientation, is unacceptable. Harassment against children in \nschool  for  these  very  reasons  is  even  more  inappropriate.  The  Final  Rule  redefines  “sex \ndiscrimination”  to  include  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  sex  stereotypes,  and  sex \ncharacteristics; preempts state law to the contrary; requires students to be allowed to access \nbathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity; prohibits schools from requiring \nmedical or other documentation to validate the student’s gender identity; requires schools to use \nwhatever pronouns the student requires; and imposes additional requirements that will result in \nsubstantial costs to the school.  \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 2 of 40 PageID #:  2324\nContained within the 423-page Final Rule are substantive and procedural regulations that \namend previous Title IX regulations.1 Such changes will significantly affect every public school \nand college in the United States. The primary changes include: \n1)  Adding 34 CFR 106.10 to read: \n \n106.10 Scope \nDiscrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation or gender identity.2 \n \n2)  Revising 34 C.F.R. 106.6 to declare that the Final Rule preempts state law.3  \n \n3)  Revising 34 C.F.R. 106.8 to require recipients to designate, hire, and pay for a Title IX \nCoordinator to ensure compliance with Title IX. This revision further requires recipients to \ntrain employees and hire investigators and facilitators. The revision additionally sets forth \nrequired grievance procedures.4 \n \n4)  Revises 34 C.F.R. 106.6(b) to prohibit any recipient from adopting or implementing any \npractice or procedure concerning a student’s current, potential, or past parental, family, or \nmarital status where such practice or procedure treats students differently on the basis of \nsex.5 \n \n5)  Amends 34 C.F.R. 106.44 to require recipients “with knowledge of conduct that reasonably \nmay constitute sex discrimination in its education program or activity” to mandatorily \nreport the conduct to the Title IX Coordinator or to give the person alleging discrimination \nthe Title IX Coordinator’s contact information.6 \n \n6)  Amends  34  C.F.R.  106.45  to  impose  grievance  procedures  for  complaints  of  sex \ndiscrimination.  This  includes  requiring  the  recipient  to  perform  and/or  conduct  an \ninvestigation into alleged sex discrimination complaints, interview witnesses, and obtain \nevidence.7 \n \n7)  Prohibits recipients from requiring medical or any other documentation to validate the \nstudent’s gender identity.8 \n \n \n1 20 U.S.C. § 1681-1688. \n2 89 Fed. Reg. at 33886. \n3 Section (b) states that despite any state law to the contrary, the recipients are still required to comply with Title IX \nand its regulations. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33885.

History of Title IX  \nOn June 23, 1972, Congress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments,15which forbid \neducational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating on the \nbasis of sex. Title IX was a direct response to the discrimination of women in educational programs \nand activities. As of 1970, only eight percent (8%) of American women had a college degree, and \nonly fifty-nine (59%) percent had graduated from high school.16 Title 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) \nprovides: \nNo  person…  shall,  on  the  basis  of  sex,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance. \n \nThe text of Title IX confirms that Title IX was intended to prevent biological women from \nbeing  discriminated  against  in  education  in  favor  of  biological  men.  Title  IX  lists  several \nexemptions which use the language “one sex” or “both sexes” showing that the statute was \nreferring to biological men and biological women, not gender identity, sexual orientation, sex \nstereotypes, or sex characteristics. Title 20 U.S.C. § 1681 contains the following exemptions \n(collectively referred to as “Exemptions”): \n \n15 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.  \n16 Equal Access to Education: Forty Years of Title IX, U.S. Dep’t.

In 2009, approximately 87 percent of women had at least a high \nschool education and approximately 28 percent had at least a college \ndegree, up from 59 percent with a high school education and 8 \npercent with a college degree in 1970. Additionally, enrollment in \nhigher education has increased at a greater rate for females than for \nmales; since 1968, the percentage of women between the ages of 25 \nand 34 with at least a college degree has more than tripled. Women \nnow have higher graduation rates and lower high school dropout \nrates,  take  more  Advanced  Placement  exams,  and  earn  more \nadvanced degrees than their male counterparts. They also tend to \nscore higher in reading assessment tests than male students.26 \n \n  The DOJ Equal Access bulletin also noted how Title IX expanded women’s access to high \nschool  athletic  programs,  noting  that  from  1972  to  2011  female  participation  rose  from \napproximately 250,000 in 1972 to 3,250,000 in 2011.27 In discussing the success of Title IX for \nwomen in athletics more thoroughly, Deborah Brake wrote in the University of Michigan Journal \nof Law Reform that: \nTitle IX has paved the way for significant increases in athletic \nparticipation for girls and women at all levels of education. Since \nthe enactment of Title IX, female participation in competitive sports \nhas soared to unprecedented heights. Fewer than 300,000 female \nstudents participated in interscholastic athletics in 1976. By 1998-\n99, that number exceeded 2.6 million, with significant increases in \neach intervening year. To put these numbers in perspective, since \nTitle IX was enacted, the number of girls playing high school sports \nhas gone from one in twenty-seven to one in three.28 \n \n26 DOJ Equal Access pp. 2-3. \n27 Id. pp. 4-5. \n28 Deborah Brake, The Struggle for Sex Equality in Sport and the Theory Behind Title IX, 34 U.

There is nothing in the text or history of Title IX \nindicating that the law was meant to apply to anyone other than biological men and/or women. The \nlogic of Title IX was sound, the execution was flawless, and the application has had stellar results \nfor years. Therefore, the Court must ask itself, what is the driving force behind a change to such a \nsuccessful and inclusive rule, and if the driving force has legitimate reasons for the change, why \nis the enforcement of the changes being done in such a hurried and sloppy manner?  \nb.  The Final Rule  \nThe Final Rule is what is at issue here, but in order for the Court to thoroughly examine \nthat rule, it must start at the beginning, which goes back to January 2021, i.e., the beginning of \nPresident Joe Biden’s (“President Biden”) term in office. \nOn the same day of his inauguration,29 President Biden executed Executive Order 13988, \nentitled “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual \nOrientation.”30 This Executive Order declared that discrimination “because of sex” includes \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation under Title IX and other \nfederal laws. \n  The Executive Order directed the head of each agency, as soon as practicable, to review all \nexisting orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions that \nwere promulgated or administered by the agency under Title VII or any other statute or regulation \nthat prohibits sex discrimination. The head of each agency was also ordered to consider whether \nto revise, suspend, or rescind agency actions and to consider whether there were additional actions \n \n29 January 20, 2021. \n30 86 Fed. Reg 7023 (January 20, 2021). \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 8 of 40 PageID #:  2330\nthe agency should take in implementing the Executive Order. Additionally, the head of each agency \nwas ordered to devise a plan within 100 days to implement those actions. \n  On  June  22,  2021,  the  DOE,  Office  for  Civil  Rights  (“OCR”)  published  an \n“Interpretation”31 of 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex) to \ninclude discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The DOE stated it would \nfully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in \neducation and activities that receive federal financial assistance from the DOE. The Interpretation \ntook effect the same day it was published.  \n  On June 23, 2021, the DOE issued a “Dear Educator” letter32 to directly notify the \ninstitutions and persons subject to Title IX of the DOE’s interpretation. This “Dear Educator” letter \nalso informed institutions and persons subject to Title IX that the DOE would begin immediately \nenforcing enforcement of discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. \n  As a result of the Interpretation and “Dear Educator” letter, Tennessee and nineteen other \nstates filed suit against the DOE, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the DOJ \nseeking a preliminary injunction to prohibit the DOE’s interpretation from taking effect. On July \n15, 2022, in Tennessee v. United States Department of Education,33 the district court granted the \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, prohibiting the DOE’s Interpretation from taking \neffect. \n  After  the  “Dear  Educator”  rule  was  enjoined,  the  DOE  engaged  in  formal  agency \nrulemaking to amend the Title IX regulations. On April 13, 2023, the DOE published a Notice of \n \n31 86 Fed. Reg. 32637. \n32 615 F.Supp. 3d at 817-18 \n33 615 F. Supp. 3d 807 (E.D. Tenn. 2022), \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 9 of 40 PageID #:  2331\nProposed Rulemaking with regard to Title IX regulations in the Federal Register.34 Comments \nwere to be received by May 15, 2023. \nThereafter, on April 29, 2024, the DOE published the Final Rule35 which contained the \namendments at issue here. The Final Rule has an effective date of August 1, 2024. \nIII.  STANDING \nA court is required to evaluate its jurisdiction, which requires a determination of whether \nthe Plaintiffs have standing. The United States Constitution, via Article III, limits federal courts’ \njurisdiction to “cases” and “controversies.” Sample v. Morrison, 406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir. 2005) \n(citing U.S. Const. art. III, § 2). The “law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-\npowers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of \nthe political branches.” Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 435 (2017) (citation \nomitted).  \nThus, “the standing question is whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in \nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant [its] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to \njustify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on his behalf.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-\n99 (1975) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Article III standing requirements \napply to claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. See Seals v. McBee, 898 F.3d 587, 591 (5th \nCir. 2018), as revised (Aug. 9, 2018); Lawson v. Callahan, 111 F.3d 403, 405 (5th Cir. 1997). In \nthe context of a preliminary injunction, “the ‘merits’ required for the plaintiff to demonstrate a \nlikelihood  of  success  include  not  only  substantive  theories  but  also  the  establishment  of \njurisdiction.” Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \n \n34 88 Fed. Reg. 22860 \n35 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 10 of 40 PageID #:  2332\nArticle III standing is comprised of three essential elements. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 \nU.S. 330, 338 (2016), as revised (May 24, 2016) (citation omitted). “The plaintiff must have (1) \nsuffered an injury-in-fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, \nand (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. The plaintiff, as the party \ninvoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements.”  Id. (internal \ncitations omitted). Furthermore, “[a] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks \nto press and for each form of relief that is sought.” Town of Chester, N.Y., 581 U.S. at 439 (citations \nomitted). However, the presence of one party with standing “is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s \ncase-or-controversy requirement.” Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 151 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing Rumsfeld \nv. F. for Acad. & Institutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)). Further, a plaintiff’s standing \nis evaluated at the time of filing of the initial complaint in which they joined. Lynch v. Leis, 382 \nF.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 2004); Davis v. F.E.C., 554 F.3d 724, 734 (2008); S. Utah Wilderness All. \nv. Palma, 707 F.3d 1143, 1153 (10th Cir. 2013). \nIn order to establish standing, the plaintiff must demonstrate that they have encountered or \nsuffered an injury attributable to the defendant’s challenged conduct and that such injury is likely \nto be resolved through a favorable decision. Lujan v. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). \nFurther, during the preliminary injunction stage, the movant is only required to demonstrate a \nlikelihood of proving standing. Speech First, Inc. v. Fenves, 979 F.3d 319, 330 (5th Cir. 2020). For \nthe reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of \nsatisfying Article III’s standing requirements. \n(1) Injury-in-fact \nPlaintiffs seeking to establish injury-in-fact must show that they suffered “an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest” that is “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 11 of 40 PageID #:  2333\nconjectural or hypothetical.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted). For an injury to be “particularized,” it must “affect the plaintiff in a personal and \nindividual way.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014), the Supreme Court held \nthat, for purposes of an Article III injury-in-fact, an allegation of future injury may suffice if there \nis “a ‘substantial risk’ that the harm will occur.” (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 408, (2013)). In SBA List, a petitioner challenged a statute that prohibited making certain false \nstatements during the course of a political campaign. Id. at 151–52. In deciding whether the pre-\nenforcement  challenge  was  justiciable—and  in  particular,  whether  it  alleged  a  sufficiently \nimminent injury for purposes of Article III—the Court noted that pre-enforcement review is \nwarranted under circumstances that render the threatened enforcement “sufficiently imminent.” Id. \nat 159. Specifically, the Court noted that past enforcement is “good evidence that the threat of \nenforcement is not ‘chimerical.’” Id. at 164 (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 \n(1974)). Similarly, in Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat. Union, 442 U.S. 289, 302 (1979), the \nSupreme Court held that a complaint alleges an Article III injury-in-fact where fear of future injury \nis not “imaginary or wholly speculative.” \n  Plaintiffs consist of four states36 and a total of eighteen Louisiana Parish School Boards \n(“School Board Plaintiffs”).37 Plaintiffs argue they are injured because the Final Rule (1) conflicts \nwith State laws that are designed to safeguard female sports, safety, privacy and parental rights, \n(2) results in non-recoverable costs of complying with the Final Rule, (3) requires Plaintiffs to \nsecure funding, and (4) interferes with the State Plaintiffs’ sovereign authority to enforce its laws, \n \n36 Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho (Plaintiff States”). \n37 School Board Plaintiffs consist of Webster Parish, Red River Parish, Bossier Parish, Sabine Parish, Grant Parish, \nWest Carroll Parish, Caddo Parish, Natchitoches Parish, Caldwell Parish, Allen Parish, LaSalle Parish, Jefferson Davis \nParish, Ouachita Parish, Franklin Parish, Acadia Parish, DeSoto Parish, St. Tammany Parish and Rapides Parish. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 12 of 40 PageID #:  2334\nwhich in turn interferes with the Plaintiff States’ police power over public health policy. Plaintiffs \nfurther argue they are facing “substantial pressure” from the DOE to change their state laws. \nSimilarly, School Board Plaintiffs assert that they are being pressured to revise their current \npolicies and practices or risk losing significant federal funding. School Board Plaintiffs further \nargue  they  will  suffer  harm  by  increased  recordkeeping,  additional  obligations,  potential \ncomplaints, administrative investigation, private litigation, increased liability exposure, and/or \ndecreased enrollment of students. \n  School Board Plaintiffs prepared ten Declarations discussing the injuries school boards \nwould suffer if the Final Rule were to go into effect.38 School Board Plaintiffs received millions \nof dollars of federal funds for the 2022-23 school year ranging from a low of $2,907,104 to a high \nof $75,635,132. Each School Board Plaintiff indicated that the Final Rule increased its federal \nobligations,  compliance  costs,  and  litigation  risks.  Most  School  Board  Plaintiffs  also  had \nconstruction costs to construct gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms.39 The School Board \nPlaintiffs additionally estimated decreased school enrollment, loss of teachers, and increased \nlitigation. The School Board Plaintiffs further expressed concerns about whether the Final Rule \nwould apply to sports, which would incur substantial additional costs. \n  Louisiana State Superintendent of Education Preston Brumley estimated that federal funds \naccounted for approximately 13% of Louisiana State school funding ($725,432,889) last year.40 \nFurther, Plaintiff States argue that the Final Rule conflicts with their duly enacted laws (and soon-\nto-be enacted laws) designed to safeguard female sports, safety, privacy, and parental rights. See, \ne.g., La. Rev. Stat. §§ 4:442, 4:444; Miss. Code Ann. §§ 37-97-1, 37-97-3, Mont. Ann. §§ 1-1-201, \n \n38 Allen, Caldwell, Franklin, Grant, Jefferson, LaSalle, Ouachita, Sabine, St. Tammany and West Carroll Parish School \nBoards [Doc. No. 18-16 -25]. \n39 The DOE made no attempt to estimate construction costs in the Final Rule. 89 Fed. Reg. 33849-878. \n40 [Doc. Nos. 18-33, 34]. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 13 of 40 PageID #:  2335\n20-7-1306, 40-6-704, Idaho Code §§ 73-114(2), 33-6201–6203, 33-6701–6707; S.B. 2753, 2024 \nLeg. Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2024); see also H.B. 610, 2024 Leg. Reg. Sess. (La. 2024); H.B. 121, 2024 \nLeg. Reg. Sess. (La. 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885.41 \nDefendants  contest  Plaintiffs  have  sustained  irreparable  harm  needed  to  justify  a \npreliminary injunction, but Defendants do not contest injury-in-fact. \nBy  alleging  injuries  due  to  compliance  costs,  conflicts  with  state  laws,  additional \nrecordkeeping, construction costs, and violation of First Amendment Rights, Plaintiffs have shown \nthey have suffered invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and \nactual and imminent. The inquiries are actual and imminent because the Final Rule is set to go into \neffect in August.  \n  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have alleged a likelihood of establishing an injury-in-fact \nsufficient to satisfy Article III. \n(2) Traceability  \nTo establish traceability or “causation” in this context, a plaintiff must demonstrate a \n“direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Holmes v. Sec. Inv. \nProt. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). Therefore, courts examining this element of standing must \nassess the remoteness, if any, between the plaintiff’s injury and the defendant’s actions. As \nexplained in Ass'n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. Schiff, the plaintiff must establish that it is \n“‘substantially probable that the challenged acts of the defendant, not of some absent third party’ \ncaused or will cause the injury alleged.” 518 F. Supp. 3d 505, 513 (D.D.C. 2021), aff'd sub nom. \nAss'n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Schiff, 23 F.4th 1028 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (\"AAPS II\") \n(quoting Fla. Audubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). \n \n41 [Doc. No. 24, p. 36] \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 14 of 40 PageID #:  2336\nDefendants do not contest traceability.  \n  In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envt. Study Grp., the United States Supreme Court found \nthat a plaintiff’s injury was fairly traceable to a statute under a theory of “but-for” causation. 438 \nU.S. 59 (1978). The plaintiffs, who were comprised in part of individuals living near the proposed \nsites for nuclear plants, challenged a statute that limited the aggregate liability for a single nuclear \naccident under the theory that, but for the passing of the statute, the nuclear plants would not have \nbeen constructed. Id. at 64-65. The Supreme Court agreed with the district court’s finding that \nthere was a “substantial likelihood” that the nuclear plants would have been neither completed nor \noperated absent the passage of the nuclear-friendly statute. Id. at 75. \n  Similarly, Plaintiffs easily meet the traceability standard. All of the alleged injuries have a \ndirect relation between the Final Rule and injuries alleged. The Final Rule here is the but-for cause \nof any of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. Therefore, it is unquestionable that the actions of Defendants \nin implementing the Final Rule are the cause of the Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries, and Plaintiffs have \nestablished traceability for standing purposes. \n(3) Redressability  \nThe redressability element of the standing analysis requires that the alleged injury is “likely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61. “To determine whether an \ninjury is redressable, a court will consider the relationship between ‘the judicial relief requested’ \nand the ‘injury’ suffered.” California v. Texas, 141 U.S. 2104, 2115, 210 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2021) \n(quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 n.19 (1984), abrogated by Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014)). Additionally, courts typically find that where an \ninjury is traceable to a defendant’s conduct, it is usually redressable as well. See, e.g., Scenic Am., \nInc. v. United States Dep't of Transportation, 836 F.3d 42, 54 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“[C]ausation and \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 15 of 40 PageID #:  2337\nredressability are closely related, and can be viewed as two facets of a single requirement.”); Toll \nBros. v. Twp. of Readington, 555 F.3d 131, 142 (3d Cir. 2009) (“Redressability . . . is closely related \nto traceability, and the two prongs often overlap.”); El Paso Cnty. v. Trump, 408 F. Supp. 3d 840, \n852 (W.D. Tex. 2019). \nPlaintiffs argue that they are likely to prove that a favorable decision would redress their \ninjuries because they provided ample evidence that their injuries are imminent and ongoing. In \nresponse, Defendants contend that any threat of future injury is merely speculative.  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prove that their injuries would be redressed by \na preliminary injunction. The Defendants have attempted to enact these rules for three- and one-\nhalf years. The Plaintiffs would be required to immediately hire additional employees and a Title \nIX Coordinator, train employees, and/or begin additional construction in order to comply with the \nFinal Rule before it goes into effect. Thus, Plaintiffs are likely to prove that the injuries are \nimminent and would be redressed by a Preliminary Injunction. \n  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied all the requirements for Article III standing. \nIV.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nThe Plaintiffs move the Court to issue a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation \nof the Defendants’ Final Rule. A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that \nshould never be awarded as of right. Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008). A movant must \nmake a clear showing that it is entitled to relief. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, \n22 (2008). Specifically, to obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant must show: (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm; (3) the threat of \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 16 of 40 PageID #:  2338\nirreparable harm outweighs any harm that would result if the injunction were granted; and (4) an \ninjunction is in the public interest.42 \nHere, Defendants contend that a preliminary injunction is not warranted because Plaintiffs \nhave not established irreparable harm; that the Final Rule is a “clarification” and not a change in \nthe law; the Defendants have the authority to enforce the Final Rule; and the Final Rule does not \nviolate the Spending Clause, First Amendment, or the major question doctrine.  \nPlaintiffs argue that a preliminary injunction is necessary here to cure the unlawfulness of \nthe Final Rule. Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the Final Rule \"ignores the text, structure, and \ncontext of Title IX to advance Defendants’ political and ideological agenda. Defendants have no \nauthority [] to rewrite Title IX and decide major questions as the Final Rule does. The Final Rule \nalso violates the Spending Clause, is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power, and fails \narbitrary-and-capricious review several times over. And to top it off, the Final Rule causes \nPlaintiffs  immediate  irreparable  harm  and  will  cause  additional  irreparable  harm,  including \nunrecoverable compliance costs.”43 \nAfter considering the extensive and expedited briefing herein, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \nsatisfied all elements required for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, and it GRANTS \nPlaintiffs’ Motions for the following reasons.  \na.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nTo show a likelihood of success on the merits, the Plaintiffs must “present a prima facie \ncase, but need not show it is certain to win.” Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595-96 (5th Cir. \n2011). As stated previously, Plaintiffs make four arguments for why they are likely to succeed on \nthe merits. These arguments are that (1) the Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds statutory \n \n42 Louisiana v. Becerra, 20 F.4th 260, 262 (5th Cir. 2021). \n43 [Doc. No. 24, p. 12] \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 17 of 40 PageID #:  2339\nauthority; (2) the Final Rule’s conditions violate the spending clause; (3) the Final Rule is an \nunconstitutional exercise of legislative power; and (4) the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  \n1.  The Final Rule is Contrary to Law and Exceeds Statutory Authority \nPlaintiffs argue that because the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX’s text and structure and \nDefendants have no statutory authority to subvert Title IX or to decide major questions, then they \nare likely to succeed in showing that the Final Rule is not in accordance with the law and exceeds \nstatutory authority under Title 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).44 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) reads as \nfollows: \nTo  the  extent  necessary  to  decision  and  when  presented,  the \nreviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret \nconstitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning \nor applicability of the terms of an agency action. The reviewing \ncourt shall— \n(2)  hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency  action,  findings,  and \nconclusions found to be-- \n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law;  \n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right[.] \n \nThe Court will analyze this argument in parts, beginning with the Final Rule’s contrariness \nto the text of Title IX. \na.  Contrariness to Title IX \nAs stated earlier, Title IX provides, in relevant part, that “No person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance[.]”   \n \n44 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), the Administrative Procedures Act \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 18 of 40 PageID #:  2340\nPlaintiffs argue that the plain text of the statute reads that there is a prohibition on \ndiscrimination based on someone’s biological text and that the Final Rule’s requirement that \nrecipients consider gender identity and treat people consistent with their self-professed gender \nidentity is at odds with Title IX.  \nDefendants rely on Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020) to support \ntheir interpretation of “sex discrimination” under Title IX. In Bostock, the Supreme Court found \nthat an employer violates Title VII45 by firing an individual for being homosexual or transgender \nbecause sex plays a necessary and undistinguished role in that employment decision. Id. at 662. \nDefendants applied this holding to find that “sex discrimination” under Title IX included not only \nbiological men and women but also discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity.  \nHowever, applying Bostock to Title IX is not that straightforward. First, the DOE maintains \nit has the power to issue the Final Rule because Bostock only “clarifies” the laws and does not \nchange it.46 However, the Supreme Court specifically did not determine whether Bostock applied \nto other federal laws.47 Id. at 681. Second, there exists a split among the courts as to the application \nof Bostock to Title IX, with some courts finding that Bostock applies to Title IX48 and others finding \n \n45 Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate against an individual “because of” the individual’s sex.  \n46 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 \n47 The Supreme Court stated, “The employers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or \nstate laws that prohibit sex discrimination…. But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit \nof adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today.” 590 U.S. at \n681. \n48 Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586, 617 (4th Cir. 2020) (Bostock applied to Title \nIX claims); Doe by and through Doe v. Boyertown Area School District, 897 F.3d 518, 536 (3rd Cir. 2018) \n(prior to Bostock, but refused to enjoin school allowing transgender students to use bathroom, and locker rooms \nconsistent with their gender identity in a Title IX claim); Grabowski v. Arizona Bd. of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1118 \n(9th Cir. 2023) (found Bostock applied to Title IX claims); AC by MCV Metropolitan School District of Martinsville, \n75 F.4th 760, 770 (7th Cir. 2023) (Bostock applies to Title IX); Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th 103, 114 (9th Cir. 2022) (a \nfaithful application of Bostock causes us to conclude that the district court’s understanding of  Bostock was far too \nnarrow)  \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 19 of 40 PageID #:  2341\nthat it does not.49 Because a circuit split exists and there is no binding federal jurisprudence on this \nissue, the Court must make its own interpretation as to the applicability of Bostock to Title IX. For \nthe reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Bostock does not apply to Title IX.  \nFirst, when interpreting a statutory term, the Court must interpret the words in a manner \nconsistent with the ordinary meaning at the time Congress enacted the statute. Wisconsin Central \nLtd. v. U.S., 585 U.S. 274, 277 (2018); Perrin v. U.S., 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979). A fundamental canon \nof statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their \nordinary, contemporary meaning. Id. at 284. To interpret the meaning of a word, Courts look at the \nmeaning of the word at the time Congress enacted it. Id. Courts routinely consult dictionaries as a \nprincipal source of ordinary meaning at the time of enactment. Cascabel Cattle Company, LLC v. \nUnited States, 955 F.3d 445, 451 (5th Cir. 2020).  \nIn applying these statutory principles to Title IX, the Court finds that the term “sex \ndiscrimination” only included discrimination against biological males and females at the time of \nenactment. Plaintiffs provided this Court with three different dictionary definitions of “sex” before, \nat, and after Title IX’s enactment in 1972.50 All these dictionaries define “sex” as “male or female.” \nDefendants have not provided a single dictionary definition that defined “sex” as including gender \nidentity or sexual orientation either before or at the time of Title IX’s enactment. Additionally, \n \n49 Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. en banc. 2022); (“sex” in Title IX, at the time \nof enactment, meant biological sex); Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021). (The rule in \nBostock extends no further than Title VII). Neese v. Becerra, 640 F.Supp. 3d 668, 666-667 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (Bostock \ndoes not extend to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act or Title IX.) Tennessee v. United States Dept. of Educ., \n615 F.Supp. 3d 807, 839 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). (DOE guidance creates rights for students and obligation for regular \nentities not to discriminate based upon sexual orientation or gender identity that appear nowhere in Bostock, Title IX \nor its implementing regulations); Meriweather v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (it does not follow that \nprinciples announced in Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context.); and Texas v. United States, 201 \nF.Supp. 3d 810, (N.D. Texas 2016) (before Bostock, but held the DOE’s “Dear Colleague Letter” sent to schools to \nallow students to use the bathroom, locker rooms and showers at the student’s choosing, contradicted the meaning of \nTitle IX). \n50 Sex, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1966); Sex, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1972); \nSex, American Heritage Dictionary 1187 (1969). \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 20 of 40 PageID #:  2342\nwhile Defendants argue that the Supreme Court’s prior use of the word “gender” shows gender \nidentity was included within the meaning of “sex” at the time of enactment, dictionary definitions \nduring and after enactment show the word “gender” was used as a synonym for “sex.”51 The word \n“gender”, as used in prior Supreme Court opinions, meant biological men and/or women, not \ngender identity.52 \nFurther, Congress has recognized the probative value of the 1975 Title IX regulations \n(which added Title IX’s application to women’s sports), in light of Title IX’s unique post-enactment \nhistory. Grove City Coll. V. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 567 (1984). These 1975 regulations clearly dealt \nwith protecting biological women in sports and show that sex discrimination means discrimination \nof someone based upon his or her biological sex.53  \nTogether, the ordinary meaning of “sex discrimination” at the time of enactment and the \n1975 regulations of Title IX indicate that “sex discrimination” included only biological males or \nfemales. The Court finds no support in either the ordinary meaning or the 1975 regulations that \nBostock’s interpretation of “sex” should apply to Title IX. The Court further finds that Defendants \nuse of Bostock’s interpretation of “sex” to Title IX would essentially reverse the entire premise of \nTitle IX, as it would literally allow biological males to circumvent the purpose of allowing \nbiological females to participate in sports that they were unable to participate in prior to 1975. The \ncanon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part \nof the same statutory scheme. City of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021). Here, the Final \nRule would render meaningless all of the Exemptions set forth in Title IX, such as traditionally \none-sex colleges, social fraternities and sororities, voluntary youth organizations, one-sex youth \n \n51 Sex, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 944 (1966). \n52 United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996); Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989) \n(Superseded by Statute); and Frontiero v. Richardson, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1770 (1973). \n53 40 Fed. Reg. 24132, 24134, and 24,135. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 21 of 40 PageID #:  2343\nservice organizations, beauty pageants, and the exemption that allows educational facilities to \nmaintain separate living facilities. Allowing this would allow decades of triumphs for women and \nmen alike to go down the drain, and this Court finds that Defendants’ argument is meritless. \nFinally, this Court finds that the application of Bostock and the Final Rule’s definition of \n“sex discrimination” contradict the purpose of Title IX. A statute is to be read “as a whole” because \nthe statutory language, plain or not, depends on context. King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U.S. \n215, 221 (1991); Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxton, 596 U.S. 450, 455 (2022). Here, the language, \nexemptions, legislative history, and prior regulations of Title IX demonstrates that Title IX was \nintended to prevent biological women from discrimination.54 Bostock dealt with Title VII, which \nprohibits an employer from hiring or discharging an individual because of the individual’s race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. Title IX exempts certain conduct as being discrimination by \nthe above discussed exemptions. Bostock does not apply because the purpose of Title VII to \nprohibit discrimination in hiring is different than Title IX’s purpose to protect biological women \nfrom discrimination in education.  \nThus, Title IX was written and intended to protect biological women from discrimination. \nSuch purpose makes it difficult to sincerely argue that, at the time of enactment, “discrimination \non  the  basis  of  sex”  included  gender  identity,  sex  stereotypes,  sexual  orientation,  or  sex \ncharacteristics. Enacting the changes in the Final Rule would subvert the original purpose of Title \nIX: protecting biological females from discrimination.  \nThe  above  statutory  analysis  demonstrates  that,  at  the  time  of  enactment,  “sex \ndiscrimination”  clearly  included  only  discrimination  against  biological  males  and  females. \nDefendants thus seemingly use Bostock in an attempt to circumvent Congress and make major \n \n54 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex Under Federally Assisted Education Programs and Activities, 40 Fed. Reg. \n24, 1281 (June 4, 1975). \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 22 of 40 PageID #:  2344\nchanges to the text, structure, and purpose of Title IX. Such changes are undoubtedly contrary to \nTitle IX and contrary to the Law. \nb.  The Final Rule’s “Harassment Standard” is contrary to Title IX and \nViolates the First Amendment \n \nPlaintiffs further argue that the Final Rule is contrary to law because the “Harassment \nStandard” would require recipients of federal funding under Title IX to violate First Amendment \nrights. Under the statute, harassment becomes discrimination “‘under’ the recipient’s programs” \nwhen it “is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim’s access \nto an educational opportunity or benefit” and when “the recipient exercises substantial control over \nboth the harasser and the context.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 633, 645 (emphasis added); see Meriwether, \n992 F.3d at 511.  \nPlaintiffs argue the Final Rule’s new broad “severe or pervasive” standard, which considers \nspeech or other expressive conduct that “limits” a person’s ability to participate in a program to be \ndiscriminatory harassment, cannot be squared with Title IX. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884. Plaintiffs \nfurther urge that the Final Rule’s requirement that a recipient consider conduct that occurred \noutside of its program or outside of the United States in determining whether a hostile environment \nhas been created in its education program and activity be consistent with Title IX’s harassment \nstandard. Id. at 33,530.   \nPlaintiffs further urge that this standard chills and punishes protected speech under the First \nAmendment because it would compel staff and students to use whatever pronouns a person \ndemands, even when those are contrary to grammar rules, reality, or political ideologies, and it \nfurther prohibits staff and students from expressing their own views on certain topics. Essentially, \nthe harassment standard allows for one political ideology to dominate the educational landscape \nwhile either silencing the other or calling the other “harassment” under these standards.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 23 of 40 PageID #:  2345\nThus, Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule conflicts with the “fixed star in our constitutional \nconstellation” that the government cannot “prescribe what shall be orthodox” or “force citizens to \nconfess by word or act their faith therein,” W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, \n642 (1943), and “may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \nitself offensive or disagreeable,” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989).  \nIn Opposition, Defendants argue that the harassment standard was used by the DOE in a \nsimilar standard in its enforcement of Title IX and uses a similar standard in Title VI and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Further, Defendants claim that courts and the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission have used a similar standard to identify harassment under Title VII’s \nanalogous provisions for decades.  \nAs Defendants did earlier with their attempt to use the same standards in Bostock to the \nfacts here, this attempt is equally as unconvincing. The Court is not considering the merits of this \ncase in this ruling, but it cannot overlook that the implications here are different than implication \nin something like a Title VII case. While Title VII is vastly important, and the Court sees the merits \nin harassment standards set forth in those provisions, the Court cannot simply apply the same \nstandard to federally funded educational institutions. The “harassment standard” created by the \nFinal Rule is obviously contrary to Title IX, and Plaintiffs have made compelling arguments for \nhow it can violate the free speech right of the First Amendment.  \nc.  Defendants’ Authority to Rewrite Title IX and Decide Major Questions \nPlaintiffs lastly argue that the Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds statutory authority \nbecause Defendants lack any authority to rewrite Title IX and thus decide major questions under \nthe major questions doctrine. The “major questions doctrine” provides that an agency is not \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 24 of 40 PageID #:  2346\nauthorized  to  make  decisions  of  vast  economic  and  political  significance  without  specific \ncongressional authorization.  \nTo be a “major question,” the power exercised must be of a vast economic and political \nsignificance. Utility, 573 U.S. 302, 324. Here, the Court finds that the Final Rule is an issue of vast \neconomic  significant.  The  DOE  modified  the  Title  IX  regulations  to  require  every  public \nelementary school, middle school, high school, and college in the United States that receives \nfederal financial assistance. The Final Rule also gives the student the right to sue the school, other \nstudents, the school board, teachers, and administrators if discriminated against based upon gender \nidentity, among other requirements. Recipients of Title IX will be required to make millions of \ndollars in improvements to their facilities to comply with the Final Rule.55 Should Plaintiff School \nBoards fail to comply with the Final Rule, millions of dollars of funding are at stake.56 The power \nexercised is thus of vast economic significance. \nThe issue is also one of vast political significance. The validity of the Final Rule will \nultimately determine whether biological males that identify as female are allowed in female \nbathrooms and locker rooms and vice versa. The Court finds that this effect is one of vast political \nsignificance because it will affect every public elementary school, middle school, high school, and \ncollege in the United States that receive federal funding. The Final Rule prohibits requiring \nmedical or other documentation to determine whether the biological male claiming to identify as \nfemale is sincere.57 The Final Rule also places no limit on how many times a person can change \n \n55 [Doc. No. 18-16] (“significant costs”) [Doc. No. 18-17] ($1.2 million) [Doc. No. 18-18] (“astronomical” costs); \n[Doc. No. 18-19] ($2.1 million); [Doc. No. 18-20, p. 8 (“significant” costs); [Doc. No. 18-21, p. 8] (“substantial \nexpense”); [Doc. No. 18-22] (20.3 to 20.7 million dollars); [Doc. No. 18-23 at 8] (hundreds of millions of dollars”) \n[Doc. No. 18-25, p. 7] (expensive construction costs), and [Doc. No. 18-26] (new bathrooms at 5 schools cost of $11 \nmillion dollars and up to $211.2 million if the program were expanded to each school in the district). \n56 Rapides itself receives about $30 million dollars, or about 10% of its budget as federal funding. \n57 89 Fed. Reg. 33819 \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 25 of 40 PageID #:  2347\ngender identity. And what about students that identify as non-binary?58 Title IX is silent on this \nissue, which is of vast political significance because it is a polarizing political issue that an agency \nhas no authority to make. The Court thus finds the enactment of the Final Rule is also an issue of \nvast political significance.   \nAdditionally, the Court shares a concern with Plaintiffs that the Final Rule may also \nbiological males who identify as females to compete on female sports teams. The DOE disputes \nthat the Final Rule will apply to women’s sports because the Javits Amendment and the relevant \nregulations historically interpreted Title IX’s non-discrimination mandate to tolerate sex separation \nin  activities.59 Additionally, the DOE proposed rules that govern athletics under Title IX.60 \nHowever, the Final Rule applies to sex discrimination in any educational “program” or “activity” \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.61 The terms “program” or “activity” are not defined but \ncould feasibly include sports teams for recipient schools. Certainly, the DOE has proposed rules \nand amendments, but those rules and amendments may never be enacted or may be substantially \namended. If those rules and amendments are not enacted, the Final Rule will arguably apply to \nathletic teams. There thus exists a credible concern that the Final Rule may allow biological males \nwho identify as females to compete on female sports teams. However, because the effect of the \nFinal Rule on sports is not certain, the Court is not considering that aspect of the Final Rule when \nanalyzing the major questions doctrine.  \nBecause the Final Rule is a matter of both vast economic and political significance, the \nCourt finds the enactment of this rule involves a major question pursuant to the major questions \n \n58 Person whose gender identity does not fit into the categories of male or female. \n59 89 Fed. Reg. 33816-17. \n60 88 Fed. Reg 22860 (April 13, 2023). \n61 34 C.F.R. 106.1 \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 26 of 40 PageID #:  2348\ndoctrine. Therefore, Congress must have given “clear statutory authorization”62 to the applicable \nagency. The Court finds that Congress did not give clear statutory authorization to this agency. \nAdministrative  agencies  are  creatures  of  statute. They  accordingly  possess  only  the \nauthority that Congress provides. We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency \nto exercise powers of vast economic and political significance. National Federation of Independent \nBusiness v. Department of Labor, 142 S.Ct. 661, 665 (2022). Further, an agency’s decreed result \nmust be within the scope of its lawful authority. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015). \n  Statements by individual legislators should not be given controlling effect but are an \nauthoritative guide to the statute’s construction. Grove City College v. Bell, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1218 \n(1984). Statutory permission for an agency or official to “modify” does not authorize basic and \nfundamental changes in the scheme designed by Congress, and instead that term carries “a \nconnotation of increment or limitation,” and must be read to mean “to change moderately or in \nminor fashion.” Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S.Ct. 2355, 2368 (2023). Finally, agencies are not free to \nadopt  unreasonable  interpretations  of  statutory  provisions  and  then  edit  the  other  statutory \nprovisions to mitigate the unreasonableness. Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, \n320 (2014).  \nHere, Defendants maintain they have this authority pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 1682.63 That \nstatute (in pertinent part) reads: \nEach Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend \nFederal financial assistance to any education program or activity by \nway of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or \nguaranty is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of \nSection 1681 of this title with respect to such program or activity by \nissuing rules, regulations or orders of general applicability which \nshall be consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the \n \n62 West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, 142 S.Ct. 2587 (2022); Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S.Ct. 2355, 2374-\n75 (2023). \n63 89 Fed. Reg. 33803 \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 27 of 40 PageID #:  2349\nstatute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which \nthe action is taken.64 \n \nThe Court finds that Congress did not give the Defendants “clear statutory authorization” \nto enact the Final Rule. Congress only gave Defendants the authority to issue rules, regulations, or \norders to “effectuate the provisions of Section 1681” that “shall be consistent with the achievement \nof the objectives of the Statute.” However, as discussed above, Defendants are attempting to \ncircumvent Congress by using Bostock to make major changes in Title IX law. Such changes are \ninconsistent with the text, structure, and purpose of Title IX.  \nAccordingly, this Court finds that Defendants do not have the authority to enact regulations \nwhich change the meaning of “sex discrimination” to include gender identity, sexual orientation, \nsex stereotypes or sex characteristics. \n2.  The Final Rule’s Conditions Violate the Spending Clause \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because the Final \nRule’s conditions do not satisfy the elements imposed by Congress in the Spending Clause. The \nSpending Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to impose taxes and borrow \nmoney to “pay the Debts and provide for the … general welfare of the United States.” U.S. \nConstitution, Art. I, Section 8, c1. 1. Legislation enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause is much \nin the nature of a contract. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981). In return for federal funds, the State agrees to comply with federally imposed conditions. \nId. However, the State must accept the terms of the contract voluntarily and knowingly. Id. If \nCongress intends to impose a condition, it must do so unambiguously. Id. By insisting Congress \nspeak with a clear voice, the States can exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant with the \nconsequences of their participation. Id. \n \n64 20 U.S.C. 1682. \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 28 of 40 PageID #:  2350\n  Although the federal government cannot control state conduct directly, Congress often uses \nits power to tax and spend as a work-around by offering federal funds in exchange for states \nestablishing preferred programs or enacting favored laws. West Virginia by and through Morrisey \nv. U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, 59 F. 4th 1124, 1131 (11th Cir. 2023). In a pre-enforcement \nconstitutional challenge, the injury-in-fact requirement can be satisfied by establishing a “realistic \ndanger of sustaining direct injury” from the statute’s operation or enforcement. Id. at 1137. \n  Further, conditioned funding grants enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause must satisfy \nfive elements: (1) the expenditure must advance the general welfare; (2) any attached condition \nmust be unambiguous; (3) conditions must relate to the federal interest in particular natural projects \nor programs; (4) conditions cannot violate another constitutional provision. In some circumstances, \nconditions cannot be so coercive that pressure turns into compulsion. If the first four elements are \nnot satisfied, it is unconstitutional. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-11 (1987). Title IX is \nenacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause. Davis v. Monroe County Bd. \nof Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999).  \nHere, Plaintiffs argue the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because it is ambiguous, \ncontrary to the federal interest, would require participants to engage in unconstitutional activities, \nand is so coercive that it is compulsive. Plaintiffs contend that the term “sex discrimination” could \nnot have provided the Plaintiffs with notice that the term “sex” included gender identity, sex \ncharacteristics, sexual orientation, or sex stereotypes. Defendants argue that Bostock should have \nprovided notice to the Plaintiffs that “sex discrimination” also included gender identity, sex \ncharacteristics, sexual orientation, or sex stereotypes.  \n  First, because Title IX was enacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending \nClause, the regulatory scheme must provide funding recipients with notice that they may be liable \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 29 of 40 PageID #:  2351\nfor their failure to abide by the terms. Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Bd. Of \nEduc., 526 U.S. 629, 640, 643 (1999). As previously discussed, when Title IX was enacted in 1972, \n“sex discrimination” only referred to biological women and men. It did not include gender identity, \nsex characteristics, sexual orientation, or sex stereotypes. Also, as discussed, Title VII, which was \nat issue in Bostock, is much different than Title IX. Even though the Defendants had failed attempts \nto change the definition of “sex discrimination”, proper notice was not given by Defendants to \nPlaintiffs.  \nSecond, the regulatory scheme must also comply with the elements for conditioned funding \ngrants. The Court ultimately finds that the Final Rule is ambiguous and thus violates the Spending \nClause. The new regulation implemented by the Final Rule clearly changes the prior regulations. \nThe Final Rule interprets the original wording of “sex discrimination” in 20 U.S.C. § 1981 to \ninclude sexual orientation, sex characteristics, sex stereotypes, and gender identity. The Final Rule \nalso  requires  participants  with  knowledge  of  conduct  that  may  reasonably  constitute  sex \ndiscrimination to report it to the Title IX Coordinator. The Final Rule interprets the statute to create \nnew requirements for a “hostile work environment.”   \nThe Final Rule does not discuss the effect changing the interpretation will have on middle \nschool, high school, and college sports. Consequently, a recipient could not have interpreted sexual \ndiscrimination to include gender identity prior to the Defendants’ intended changes. The Final Rule \nis not a clarification of existing laws – it is a new law enacted by an administrative agency, not \nCongress. This Court thus finds the Final Rule ambiguous. Because the Court finds the Final Rule \nis ambiguous, the Court finds that it does not satisfy the elements of the Spending Clause, and \nthus, it violates the Spending Clause. \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 30 of 40 PageID #:  2352\nThis Court finds the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because it contains ambiguous \nconditions and because the Final Rule violates other constitutional provisions – free speech and \nfree exercise. Because this Court has found the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause, there is \nno need to discuss the Plaintiffs’ argument that the Final Rule violates the non-delegation doctrine. \n3.  Whether the Final Rule is an Unconstitutional Exercise of Legal Power \nPlaintiffs also argue that because there was no true intelligible principle guiding the DOE’s \ndiscretion, then the Final rule is an impermissible exercise of legal power. In support of this \nargument, Plaintiffs claim that if Congress delegated the authority to issue the Final Rule, which \nthe Court found it did not, then the delegation would violate Article I and separation-of-powers \nprinciples. Because the Court finds that Congress did not impose this authority, an analysis on this \nargument is unnecessary.  \n4.  Whether the Final Rule is Arbitrary and Capricious under the APA \nPlaintiffs maintain the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious in accordance with APA Title \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Courts presume that when an agency-administrated statute is ambiguous \nwith respect to what it prescribes, Congress has empowered the agency to resolve the ambiguity. \nThe question for a reviewing court is whether, in resolving the ambiguity, the agency acted \nreasonably and thus “stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.” Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. \nNational Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). \nEven under Chevron’s deferential framework, agencies must operate “within the bounds of \nreasonable interpretation.” Arlington v. FCC, 133 U.S. 1863, 1868 (2015). Reasonable statutory \ninterpretation must account for both “the special content in which the language is used” and “the \nbroader content of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997). \nThus, an agency interpretation that is inconsistent with the design and structure of the statute as a \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 31 of 40 PageID #:  2353\nwhole does not merit deference. University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S. \nCt. 2517, 2529 (2015).  \n  Federal administrative agencies are required to engage in “reasoned decision making.” \nAllentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc., v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998).  Not only must an \nagency’s decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority but also the process by which it \nreaches that result must be logical and rational. Michigan v. E.P.A., 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015). \nAgency action is lawful only if it rests on a consideration of the relevant factors. Id. An agency \nmay not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate. Utility, \n573 U.S. 302, 328. Agencies are not free to adopt unreasonable interpretations of statutory \nprovisions  and  then  edit  other  interpretations  of  statutory  provisions  to  mitigate  the \nunreasonableness. Id.  \n  Plaintiffs contends the Defendants were not authorized to enact the Final Rule, the process \nwas not rational and lawful, and the Final Rule is inconsistent with Title IX.  \n  To decide whether agency action is arbitrary and capricious, courts begin by asking whether \n“an agency articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.” \nLouisiana v. United States Department of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 469 (5th Cir. 2024) (citing \nExxonMobil Pipeline Co. v. DOT, 867 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir. 2017)). We then ask if the agency’s \nreasoning “fails to account for relevant factors or evinces a clear error of judgment.” Id. An agency \nmust display awareness that it is changing position. Id. When an agency changes position, such \nchanges require a careful comparison of the agency’s statements to ensure that the agency has \nrecognized the change, reasoned through it without factual or legal error, and balanced all relevant \ninterests affected by the change. Id. In sum, an administrative agency’s actions are arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency has: (1) relied on factors which Congress had not intended for it to \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 32 of 40 PageID #:  2354\nconsider; (2) entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem; (3) offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency; or (4) is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view of the product of agency expertise. \nId.  \n  This Court has found that the Defendants did not have congressional authority to enact the \nFinal Rule and that the Final Rule violates Free Speech rights, Free Exercise rights, and the \nSpending Clause. This Court further finds that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because \nthe DOE (1) failed to address relevant factors and (2) and failed to consider important aspects of \nthe problem. The Court shall address each in turn.  \n1.  DOE’s Failure to Address Relevant Factors \nThe Court finds that the DOE failed to consider several relevant factors when drafting the \nFinal Rule. These multiple failures indicate that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  \nFirst, Defendants failed to include any requirements for changing one’s gender identity and \ndid not include any guidance for addressing “non-binary” students or students with other gender \nidentities.65 A “gender fluid”66 person could possibly change gender identities every day or several \ntimes per day. The Final Rule prohibits recipients from enacting common-sense rules to make sure \nthe person who changed gender identities is sincere. Allowing a student to announce what gender \nthey are, without requiring any supporting documentation, is arbitrary and capricious.   \nSecond, Defendants failed to consider that biological females and biological males that \nidentify as females have different body parts. Nearly every civilization recognizes a norm against \nexposing one’s unclothed body to the opposite sex. Doe v. Luzerne Cnty., 660 F.3d 169, 176 (3rd \n \n65 Any gender that falls outside of the binary system of male/female or man/woman. Adams, supra note 31. \n66 A “gender fluid” person is a person who does not identify with a single fixed gender and expresses a fluid or unfixed \ngender identity. One’s expression of identity is likely to shift and change depending on context. Cydney Adams, The \nGender Identity Terms You Need To Know, CBS INTERACTIVE, INC., March 24, 2017.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 33 of 40 PageID #:  2355\nCir. 2011). Yet, Defendants did not consider these cultural norms or the reasons such norms are so \nprevalent when adopting the Final Rule.  \nThird, the Defendants failed to consider the effect of the additional costs on the recipient \nschools and only gave those schools three months to comply.  However, compliance requires \nrecipient schools to hire a Title IX Coordinator, redesign locker rooms and bathrooms, provide \ntraining to all staff and students,67 and likely pay much higher liability insurance premiums. The \nincreased liability exposure for placing biological males who identify as females, and vice versa, \ninto women’s locker rooms and bathrooms will likely greatly increase insurance premiums, if \ncovered at all.  The Final Rule did not even consider or discuss these additional construction and \ninsurance costs.  \nFourth, Defendants failed to consider the Final Rule’s effect on the Exemptions68 that allow \nmales and females to be separated. The only reference to the application of the new definitions \ndiscussed in 34 C.F.R. 106.31(2) is ambiguous. It states: \n(2) In the limited circumstances in which Title IX or this part permits \ndifferent treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must \nnot carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than \nde minimus harm except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) \nthrough (9) and the corresponding regulations. \n \n  The Court questions how this regulation affects Title IX’s Exemptions for fraternities and \nsororities, voluntary youth organizations, public colleges that have traditionally only admitted \nstudents of one sex, beauty pageants, and other exemptions. The language refers to the Exemptions \nthat allow separation on the basis of sex but then states any sex separation cannot be done if it \nsubjects a person to “more than de minimis harm.” It makes the Exemptions meaningless. It \n \n67 See FN 50  \n68 See Section II. \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 34 of 40 PageID #:  2356\narguably changes the law in the Title IX Exemptions where the Exemptions cannot be relied on to \nallow sex separation. It is ambiguous and therefore arbitrary and capricious.   \nFinally, despite receiving more than 240,000 comments, including numerous comments \nopposing the proposed rule,69 Defendants only made minor changes to the proposed rules. Many \nof the comments pointed out the problems the Final Rule had, including, but not limited to, no \nauthority, ambiguity, violation of the Spending Clause, violation of First Amendment Free Speech \nand Free Exercise rights, and lack of religious exemptions. Despite the comments, the Final Rule \ndid not change anything regarding those issues.  \n2.  DOE’s  Failure  to  Consider  Important  Aspects  of  the \nProblem  \n \nThe Court finds that the DOE failed to consider several important aspects of the problems \nwith the Final Rule. \nTitle IX was enacted  for the protection of the discrimination  of biological  females. \nHowever, the Final Rule may likely cause biological females more discrimination than they had \nbefore Title IX was enacted. Importantly, Defendants did not consider the effect the Final Rule \nwould have on biological females by requiring them to share their bathrooms and locker rooms \nwith biological males. The Final Rule only focuses on the “effect on the student who changes their \ngender identity” and fails to address the effect on the other students (“cisgender students”). These \ncisgender females must use the bathroom, undress, and shower in the presence of persons who \nmay identify as females but still have male biological parts. Many of these students are minors. \nThe DOE made no attempt to determine the effect on students having students who are biologically \n \n69 89 Fed. Reg. 33477. \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 35 of 40 PageID #:  2357\nthe opposite sex in their locker rooms and bathrooms. Instead, the DOE declared in the Final Rule, \nwith no explanation, that transgender students do not pose a safety risk for cisgender students.70 \nFurther, by allowing biological men who identify as a female into locker rooms, showers, \nand bathrooms, biological females risk invasion of privacy, embarrassment, and sexual assault. \nFurther, by not requiring medical or other documentation to verify that biological men actually \nidentify as females, the only Final Rule requirement is for a person to simply declare they have \nchanged gender identities. This protocol likewise places biological females at risk. After that \ndeclaration is made, these schools are prohibited from questioning the sincerity of the new gender \nidentity. The school cannot require any documentation to prove the sincerity of the gender change, \ni.e., doctor diagnosis. The school also must use the pronouns required by the student that changes \ngender. Allowing a biological male student to change to a female by simply declaring it, requiring \nno documentation of the change, and allowing the student to shower with cisgender females in the \ngirls’ locker room goes beyond the scope of arbitrary and capricious. \nIt is unambiguous that when Title IX was enacted, under the Supreme Court canons of \nconstruction, “sex discrimination” referred to biological females and males. “Sex discrimination” \ndid not refer to gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, or sexual orientation. Yet, this \nfact was ignored and not considered by Defendants. \nThis Court finds the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A).  \nIn sum, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits for their \nclaims that the (1) the Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds statutory authority; (2) the Final \n \n70 89 Fed. Reg. 33820 \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 36 of 40 PageID #:  2358\nRule’s conditions violate the spending clause; (3) the Final Rule is an unconstitutional exercise of \nlegislative power; and (4) the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  \n Accordingly, the first element for a preliminary injunction is satisfied.  \nb.  Irreparable Harm  \nThe second requirement for a Preliminary Injunction is a showing of “a substantial threat \nof irreparable injury” if the injunction is not issued. Texas, 809 F.3d at 150. For injury to be \n“irreparable,” plaintiffs need only show it cannot be undone through monetary remedies.  Burgess \nv. Fed. Deposit Inc., Corp., 871 F.3d 297, 304 (5th Cir. 2017). Deprivation of a procedural right to \nprotect a party’s concrete interests is irreparable injury. Texas, 933 F.3d at 447. Additionally, \nviolation of a First Amendment constitutional right, even for a short period of time, is always \nirreparable injury. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 347, 373 (1976). Finally, costs for expanded \nrecordkeeping requirements, expanded training requirements, and other compliance costs and \nimminent threats of costs that cannot be recovered also constitute irreparable harm. Career \nColleges and Schools of Texas v. United States Dept. of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 235-38 (5th Cir. 2024).\n  Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not shown irreparable harm because there is only a \npossibility of irreparable harm and because the compliance costs are necessary and do not justify \na preliminary injunction.  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs demonstrated a “significant threat of injury from the \nimpending action, that the injury is imminent, and that money damages would not fully repair the \nharm.” Humana, Inc., v. Jackson, 804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986). To demonstrate irreparable \nharm at the preliminary injunction stage, Plaintiffs must adduce evidence showing that the \nirreparable injury is likely to occur during the pendency of the litigation. Justin Indus. Inc., v. \nChoctaw Secs., L.P., 920 F.2d 262, 268 n. 7 (5th Cir. 1990). Plaintiffs satisfied this requirement \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 37 of 40 PageID #:  2359\nand showed that irreparable injury is likely to occur during the pendency of the litigation. This \nCourt finds that the alleged past actions of Defendants show a substantial risk of harm that is not \nimaginary or speculative. SBA List, 573 U. S. at 164. Based upon the Affidavits and Declarations \nof Plaintiffs, the compliance costs, the short time Plaintiffs have to comply, and the substantial \nlikelihood of the violations of First Amendment rights and violations of the Spending Clause, \nPlaintiffs have shown irreparable harm. Despite the Defendants’ assertion that the compliance \ncosts are minimal, the Defendants have provided no evidence to dispute both construction and \ncompliance costs. The State Plaintiffs have also shown irreparable harm in violation of First \nAmendment rights, preemption of state laws, loss of Title IX federal funds, pressure to change \ntheir laws, and invasion of state sovereignty.  \nc.  Equitable Factors and Public Interest  \nPlaintiffs must also demonstrate that the threatened harm outweighs any harm that may \nresult to the Federal Defendants and that the injunction will not undermine the public interest.  \nValley v. Rapides Par. Sch. Bd., 118 F.3d 1047, 1051 (5th Cir. 1997). These two factors overlap \nconsiderably. Texas, 809 F.3d at 187. In weighing equities, a court must balance the competing \nclaims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the \nrequested relief. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). The public interest \nfactor requires the court to consider what public interests may be served by granting or denying a \npreliminary injunction. Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 645 F.3d 978, 997–98 (8th \nCir. 2011). \n  The  balance  of  equities  and  public  interest  strongly  favors  Plaintiffs. A  preliminary \ninjunction would simply keep the status quo. There are strong arguments by Plaintiffs that Free \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:24-cv-00563-TAD-KDM   Document 53   Filed 06/13/24   Page 38 of 40 PageID #:  2360\nSpeech and Free Exercise rights are being violated. Keeping the status quo is necessary in light of \na serious question of whether Defendants had Congressional authority to enact the Final Rule.  \nDefendants  maintain  equitable  considerations  favor  Defendants  because  granting  a \npreliminary  injunction  would  significantly  harm  the  government’s  intentions  in  preventing \ndiscrimination in educational programs and activities. However, the Defendants are responsible \nfor a significant change in the status quo and for the short three-month deadline they gave the \nPlaintiffs to comply. Equity is not in Defendants’ favor.  \n  Because Plaintiffs met all the elements necessary to show entitlement to a preliminary \ninjunction, this Court shall issue said injunction against the Defendants herein. There are presently \nat least six other cases considering this issue in other courts.71 It would be appropriate for this \nCourt  to  allow  those  proceedings  to  be  decided  in  their  respective  courts.  Therefore,  this \nPreliminary Injunction will be limited to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis case demonstrates the abuse of power by executive federal agencies in the rulemaking \nprocess. The separation of powers and system of checks and balances exist in this country for a \nreason.  \nWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same \nperson, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; \nbecause apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate \nshould enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner. \n \nMontesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (1748).  \n \n \n71 State where proceeding filed is listed first.

The Judicial Branch can vacate rules that are beyond the executive agencies’ authority,73 \nbut only after a suit is filed. \n  The abuse of power by administrative agencies is a threat to democracy.  \nAccordingly, and for the reasons set forth herein,  \nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the Motion for Preliminary \nInjunctions [Doc.

See Nondiscrimination \non the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (Title IX Rule).  \nWe DENY the motion. \nPlaintiffs’ complaint and request for preliminary injunction focused \non three key provisions at the heart of the 423-page Rule: proposed 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.10 (including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and \ngender identity); § 106.2 (broadening definition of “hostile environment \nharassment”); and § 106.31(a)(2) (adopting “de minimis harm” standard for \ndetermining sex discrimination).  The DOE argues that the district court’s \norder was overbroad to the extent it enjoined implementation of the entire \nRule,  including  provisions  on  reporting  and  record-keeping  obligations, \ngrievance procedures, role and hiring of Title IX coordinators and other \nfacilitators,  and  pregnancy  discrimination  regulations.    The  DOE  also \ncontends  that  the  injunction  was  overbroad  as  to  § 106.10,  the \nimplementation of which will purportedly not harm Plaintiffs, and § 106.2’s \ninclusion of many definitions besides “hostile environment harassment.”  \nThe agency relies in part on the Rule’s severability provision.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,848 (stating “that each of the provisions of these final regulations \n. . . serve an important, related, but distinct purpose”). \nA stay pending appeal is “extraordinary relief” that defendants bear a \nheavy burden to support.  See Vote.Org v. Callanen, 39 F.4th 297, 300 (5th \nCir. 2022).  We consider four factors in determining whether to grant such a \nstay, the two most critical of which are likelihood of success on the merits and \nirreparable injury.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 1761 \n(2009). \n3 \n \n\nNo. 24-30399 \nBecause the DOE has given us little basis to assess the likelihood of \nsuccess, its motion must fail.  The primary question as to its overbreadth \ncontention is whether the possibility of a partial preliminary injunction was \nadequately identified as an option to the district court.  The answer is no.  \nPlaintiffs from the outset of the litigation sought to overturn the entire Rule, \nwhich  makes  major  changes  in  the  scope  of  coverage  of  Title  IX,  adds \ncomplex,  lengthy  and  burdensome  recordkeeping  and  enforcement \nrequirements, and extends Title IX to pregnancy for the first time.  The \nDOE’s initial response to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary relief, according \nto the district court, was that the Rule only amounts to a “clarification” of \nTitle IX and does not irreparably harm Plaintiffs.  The DOE commented at \nthe end of its response that any relief should be limited to the immediate \nparties rather than “universal relief,” and, in two conclusory sentences, that \nthe Rule’s severability provision should enable the rest of the Rule to escape \nthe preliminary injunction.  The district court made no comment about this \nvague attempt to limit ultimate relief, though it limited the preliminary \ninjunction to the parties before the court. \nEven if the DOE did not forfeit its severability argument, its motion \nplaces this court in an untenable position.  With no briefing or argument \nbelow on the consequences of a partial preliminary injunction, we would have \nto parse the 423-page Rule ourselves to determine the practicability and \nconsequences of a limited stay.  But “[a]s we have repeatedly observed, we \nare a court of review, not first view.”  Stringer v. Town of Jonesboro, 986 F.3d \n502, 509 (5th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). \nMoreover,  the  historical  purpose  of  a  preliminary  injunction,  as \nordered by the district court here, is to maintain the status quo pending \nlitigation.  See Hollon v. Mathis Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir. \n1974).  Several implications flow from this.  First, the district court has wide \nlatitude to craft a temporary remedy in accordance with the equities.  Trump \n4 \n \n\nNo. 24-30399 \nv. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 \n(2017)  (per  curiam).    Second,  in  doing  so,  the  court  will  not  abuse  its \ndiscretion if its temporary order is broader than final relief.  See Doster v. \nKendall, 54 F.4th 398, 442 (6th Cir. 2022), cert. granted, judgment vacated as \nmoot, 144 S. Ct. 481 (2023). \nTaking  these  points  together,  granting  a  partial  stay  here  would \ninvolve this court in making predictions without record support from the \nDOE about the interrelated effects of the remainder of the Rule on thousands \nof covered educational entities.  This is especially problematic when the DOE \nis asking this court to maintain, on a temporary basis, tangential provisions \nthat might or might not have been formulated in the absence of the heart of \nthe  Rule.    This  is  contrary  to  severability analysis,  which  asks whether \nseverance will “impair the function of the statute as a whole” and whether \nthe regulation would have been enacted in the absence of the challenged \nprovisions.  See K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294, 108 S. Ct. \n1811, 1819 (1988); Nasdaq Stock Mkt. LLC v. SEC, 38 F.4th 1126, 1144 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (citation omitted).  Even more problematic would be our judicial \nrewriting of the Rule on what may only be a temporary basis.  That, too, is \nnot this court’s job.  See also Ohio v. EPA, 144 S. Ct. 2040 (2024) (stay of \nEPA rule granted pending appeal despite severability provision). \nFor these reasons, the DOE has not shown a likelihood of success in \nchallenging the breadth of the district court’s preliminary injunction. \nIn any event, Plaintiffs demonstrate beyond peradventure in affidavits \nand submissions that an order allowing the Rule to remain in place pending \nappeal  would  inflict  enormous  administrative  costs  and  great  legal \nuncertainty on recipients of federal funds.  Irreparable harm is demonstrable \nby significant, unrecoverable compliance costs.  E.g., Rest. Law Ctr. v. Dep’t \nof Labor, 66 F.4th 593, 597 (5th Cir. 2023); Career Colleges & Sch. of Tex. v. \n5 \n \n\nNo. 24-30399 \nDep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 234 (5th Cir. 2024).  As Plaintiffs argue, the \nimplementation  and  compliance  costs  would  double  if  the  partially \nimplemented Rule differs from a final judgment.  They would first have to \namend their policies, alter their procedures, and train their employees to \ncomply with a partial version of the Rule pending appeal, and then they would \nhave to do it all over again to comply with the Rule as it stands at the \nconclusion of the litigation.  And, we note, the DOE gave covered recipients \nonly three months’ time to digest and comply with its behemoth Rule, less \nthan half of which remains.  Legal uncertainty would abound as to a multitude \nof  matters  like  the  extent  of  compelled  recordkeeping,  sufficiency  of \n“complaints” of sex discrimination/harassment, and obligations to monitor \n“offensive” speech and behavior under any partially implemented Rule. \nThe DOE has not shown that it would suffer irreparable injury if the \ndistrict court’s injunction were not partially stayed.  The injunction pending \nappeal does not prevent the DOE from enforcing Title IX or longstanding \nregulations to prevent sex discrimination.  The DOE can hardly be said to be \ninjured  by  putting  off  the  enforcement  of  a  Rule  it took  three  years  to \npromulgate after multiple delays.  Nor does an administrative agency have \nthe same claim to irreparable harm when its bureaucratically issued rule is \nenjoined as a democratically elected legislative body has when one of its \nstatutes is enjoined.  See Wages & White Lion Invs., LLC v. FDA, 16 F.4th \n1130, 1144 (5th Cir. 2021) (courts can grant “interim relief” to “preserve the \nstatus quo ante”); Griffin v. HM Florida-ORL, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 1, 2 n.1 (2023) \n(statement of Kavanaugh, J.) (acknowledging APA context relief is different \nfrom enjoining a statute). \nFinally, the public interest would not be served by a temporary judicial \nrewriting of the Rule that may be partly or fully undone by a final court \njudgment. \n6 \n \n\nNo. 24-30399 \nFor these reasons, the motion for partial stay is DENIED. \n7 \n ",

TENNESSEE,  ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[August 16, 2024]\n PER CURIAM. \n  The application for a partial stay presented to JUSTICE \nALITO in No. 24A78 and by him referred to the Court is \ndenied.  The application for a partial stay presented to  \nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH in No. 24A79 and by him referred to \nthe Court is denied. \n  The Department of Education recently issued a new rule \nimplementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.  The  rule  newly  defined  sex  discrimination  to\n“includ[e] discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, \n \nsex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual \norientation,  and  gender  identity.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  33886  \n(2024).\n  Several  States  and  other  parties  sought  preliminary \ninjunctions  against  the  new  rule,  arguing  among  other \nthings that the rule exceeded the bounds of the statutory\ntext enacted by Congress.  District Courts in Louisiana and \nKentucky  agreed  with  the  plaintiffs  and  preliminarily \nenjoined enforcement of the rule in the plaintiff States.  The  \n\n2  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nPer Curiam  \nCourts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits then \ndeclined to stay the injunctions in the interim period while \nthose  courts  consider  the  Government’s  appeals  of  the \npreliminary injunctions.\n  The Government has now filed emergency applications in \nthis  Court  seeking  partial  stays  of  the  preliminary \ninjunctions pending resolution of the appeals in the Fifth \nand Sixth Circuits.  The Court denies the Government’s  \napplications.\n  Importantly, all Members of the Court today accept that \nthe plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nas to three provisions of the rule, including the central \nprovision that newly defines sex discrimination to include \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender\nidentity.  But the Government argues (and the dissent  \nagrees) that those provisions should be severed and that the \nother provisions of the new rule should still be permitted to \ntake effect in the interim period while the Government’s \nappeals of the preliminary injunctions are pending in the \nCourts of Appeals.  The lower courts concluded otherwise \nbecause  the  new  definition  of  sex  discrimination  is  \nintertwined with and affects many other provisions of the \nnew rule. Those courts therefore concluded, at least at this  \npreliminary stage, that the allegedly unlawful provisions\nare not readily severable from the remaining provisions.  \nThe lower courts also pointed out the difficulty that schools \nwould face in determining how  to apply  the rule for a \ntemporary period with some provisions in effect and some \nenjoined. \n  In this emergency posture in this Court, the burden is on \nthe Government as applicant  to show, among other things, \na likelihood of success on its severability argument and that \nthe equities favor a stay.  On this limited record and in its  \nemergency applications, the Government has not provided \nthis Court a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ \ninterim conclusions that the three provisions found likely \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n   \nPer Curiam  \nto  be  unlawful  are  intertwined  with  and  affect  other \nprovisions of the rule.   Nor has the Government adequately \nidentified  which  particular  provisions,  if  any,  are \nsufficiently  independent  of  the  enjoined  definitional \nprovision  and  thus  might  be  able  to  remain  in  effect.   \nMoreover, related to the equities, the Sixth Circuit has\nalready  expedited  its  consideration  of  the  case  and \nscheduled oral argument for October.  The Court expects \nthat the Courts of Appeals will render their decisions with \nappropriate dispatch.  In light of all of the circumstances, \nthe Court denies the Government’s applications for partial \nstays. \nIt is so ordered.  \n\n  Cite as:  603 U.

TENNESSEE,  ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[August 16, 2024]\n JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR,  with  whom  JUSTICE   KAGAN, \nJUSTICE GORSUCH, and JUSTICE JACKSON join, dissenting\nin part from the denial of applications for stays. \n  Respondents challenged a Department of Education rule \nimplementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.  Respondents contend that the rule unlawfully rede-\nfines sex discrimination; that it violates students’ and em-\nployees’ rights to bodily privacy and safety; and that its def-\ninition of hostile environment harassment is  inconsistent  \nwith the statute and violates the First Amendment.  Every\nMember of  the Court agrees respondents are entitled to in-\nterim relief as to three provisions of that Rule: 34 CFR \n§106.10 (2023) (defining sex discrimination), §106.31(a)(2) \n(prohibiting schools from preventing individuals from ac-\ncessing certain sex-separated spaces consistent with their \ngender identity), and §106.2’s definition of hostile environ-\nment harassment.  Respondents’ alleged injuries flow from \nthose three provisions. \n  Today, however, a majority of this Court leaves in place  \n\n2  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \npreliminary injunctions that bar the Government from en-\nforcing the entire rule—including provisions that bear no \napparent  relationship  to  respondents’  alleged  injuries.  \nThose injunctions are overbroad.  To be sure, this litigation \nis still unfolding, and respondents might eventually show\ninjuries from the other portions of the rule.  If so, those in-\njuries might merit further relief.   For now, on the briefing \nand record currently before us, I would stay the preliminary \ninjunctions except as to the three provisions above, in keep-\ning with the traditional principle of equitable remedies that \n“relief afforded [to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more bur-\ndensome than necessary to redress the complaining par-\nties.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979); see \nMadsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765  \n(1994) (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than neces-\nsary to achieve its desired goals”). \nI \n  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a).  \nCongress charged the Department of Education with “issu-\ning rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability” to \n“effectuate” Title IX’s antidiscrimination mandate.  §1682.  \nPursuant to that authority, in April 2024, the Department \nissued an omnibus rule amending Title IX’s regulations, set \nto take effect nationwide on August 1, 2024.  See 89 Fed.  \nReg. 33474 (2024) (Rule).  The amended provisions of the\nRule cover a range of matters, most of which do not refer-\nence gender identity discrimination and went unmentioned \nby respondents.1  \n—————— \n1Those provisions include: a provision requiring access to lactation \n \nspaces and “reasonable modifications” for pregnant students, such as  re-\nstroom breaks, 89 Fed. Reg. 33888, 33895–33896 (to be codified in 34 \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n  Respondents claim they are harmed by three provisions\nof the Rule.  First, at 34 CFR §106.10, the Rule defines \n“[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex” to “includ[e] discrimi-\nnation on the basis of  sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and \ngender  identity.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  33886.  Second,  at  \n§106.31(a)(2), the Rule addresses Title IX’s application in \nsex-separated spaces.  89 Fed. Reg. 33887.  The Rule leaves  \nuntouched Title IX’s explicit recognition that schools may \ndifferentiate between students on the basis of sex in some \ncontexts, such as in assigning dormitories and creating ath-\nletic teams.2  Outside those statutory exceptions, however, \n—————— \nCFR §§106.40(b)(3)(v), 106.57); a provision affirming the legal rights of \nparents and guardians to act on behalf of complainants and respondents, \n89 Fed. Reg. 33885 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.6(g)); three provisions \naddressing schools’ obligations in  responding to claims implicating Title \nIX, including measures to assist impacted parties, employee-notification \nrequirements, Title IX coordinator duties, applicable grievance proce-\ndures, and protection of personally identifiable information, 89 Fed. Reg. \n33888–33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §§106.44, 106.45, 106.46); a pro-\nvision addressing schools’ obligations  to designate Title IX coordinators, \nand adopt and implement a nondiscrimination policy and grievance pro-\ncedures, 89 Fed. Reg. 33885–33886 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.8); a  \nprovision clarifying schools’ obligations with respect to retaliation, 89  \nFed. Reg. at 33896 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.71); a provision  clari-\nfying that the Department of Education’s Assistant Secretary of Civil \nRights will not deem a recipient to have violated the Title IX regulations \nsolely because the Assistant Secretary would have reached a different \ndecision in a particular complaint alleging  sex-based harassment,  89  \nFed. Reg.  at 33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.47); and a provision \naddressing what pre-employment inquiries a school may make regarding \nan individual’s marital status and sex, 89 Fed. Reg. 33896 (to be codified \nin 34 CFR §106.60).  \n2Specifically, those contexts include membership in fraternities or so-\n \nrorities, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a)(6), separate living facilities, §1686, and ath-\nletic teams, Education Amendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 612.  The Depart-\nment explained in the Rule that neither §106.31(a)(2) nor anything else \nin the Rule addresses or alters existing requirements governing sex sep-\naration in athletics, which is the subject of a separate rulemaking.  89  \nFed. Reg. 33816–33817.  \n\n4  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n§106.31(a)(2) states that Title IX generally permits “differ-\nent treatment or separation on the basis of sex” only to the \nextent that such differential treatment or separation does \nnot “discriminat[e]. . . by subjecting a person to more than  \nde minimis harm.”  Section 106.31(a)(2) further provides\nthat a policy or practice that “prevents a person from par-\nticipating in an education program or activity consistent \nwith the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more \nthan de minimis harm on the basis of sex.”  (Emphasis \nadded.)  Sections 106.10 and 106.31(a)(2) are the only pro-\nvisions in the entire Rule that reference “gender identity.”   \n  Third, at 34 CFR §106.2, the Rule defines several terms, \nincluding “hostile environment harassment.”  89 Fed. Reg.  \n33884.  “Hostile environment harassment” is a prohibited \nform of sex discrimination that, as defined by the Rule, in-\nvolves “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively \noffensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or de-\nnies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the \nrecipient’s education program or activity (i.e., creates a hos-\ntile environment).”  Ibid.  Respondents do not object to\n§106.2’s definitions of other terms within the Rule, such as \n“complaint,” “disciplinary sanctions,” “elementary school,” \nand “student.”  \n  Two groups of States filed suits in two District Courts \nchallenging the new Rule as unlawful.3  They contend that \n—————— \n3One suit was brought by the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Mon-\n \ntana, and Idaho, joined by the Louisiana Department of Education and \n18 Louisiana school boards.  Another suit was brought by the states of \nTennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, joined \nby an association of Christian teachers and a 15-year-old girl from West \nVirginia. Several other States and parties have filed similar suits chal-\nlenging the Rule and requesting preliminary injunctions within the \nplaintiff States.  See Kansas v. United States Dept. of Ed., __ F. Supp. 3d \n__, 2024 WL 3273285 (D Kan., July 2, 2024); Texas v.  United States, No.  \n24–CV–86, 2024 WL 3405342 (ND Tex., July 11, 2024); Carroll Inde-\npendent School District  v. United States Dept. of Ed., __  F. Supp. 3d __, \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  5 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \nthe Rule unlawfully rewrites Title IX’s prohibition on sex\ndiscrimination to include discrimination based on students’ \ngender identity.  Respondents further argue that §106.2’s \ndefinition of “hostile environment harassment” is unlawful \nunder Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629 \n(1999), because it waters down the standard for what con-\nstitutes actionable sex-based harassment: Title IX com-\nplainants can prevail under the Rule by showing the alleged \nharassment was severe or pervasive (as opposed to both)\nand do not need to prove that the offending conduct denied \nthem access to educational benefits.  Respondents sepa-\nrately assert that §106.2’s definition of “hostile environ-\nment  harassment”  violates  the  First  Amendment  by \nchilling or compelling speech, including on issues of gender \nidentity.\n  Accordingly, when respondents asked the District Courts \nto preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Rule, they fo-\ncused on the two provisions concerning gender identity—\n§§106.10 and 106.31(a)(2)—and §106.2’s definition of “hos-\ntile environment harassment.”  Respondents alleged that \nthose three provisions would cause them irreparable harm \nif the Rule went into effect.  Specifically, they asserted that \nthey would incur unrecoverable costs in complying with \nthose provisions (and a loss of Title IX funding if they failed \nto do so), that they would lose the right to speak freely on \nissues such as gender identity, and that they would be un-\nable to enforce existing state laws that conflict with the \nRule’s prohibition of gender identity discrimination.  Alt-\nhough respondents’ alleged irreparable harm apparently \ntraces back to just three of the Rule’s provisions, the Dis-\ntrict Courts preliminarily enjoined the Government from \nenforcing the entire Rule in all the respondent States.  \n—————— \n2024 WL 3381901 (ND Tex., July 11, 2024); Arkansas v. United States \nDept. of Ed., No. 4:24–CV–636, (ED Mo., July 24, 2024), ECF Doc. 54; \nAlabama v. Cardona, No. 7:24–CV–533, 2024 WL 3607492 (ND Ala., \nJuly 30, 2024).  \n\n6  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n  After unsuccessful efforts to seek relief from these over-\nbroad injunctions in the lower courts, the Government asks \nthis Court to stay the injunctions in part.  The Government \ndoes not contest the continued injunction as to §106.31(a)(2) \n(regulating access to sex-separated spaces) or §106.2’s defi-\nnition of hostile environment harassment as applied to gen-\nder identity discrimination.  Instead, it asks this Court to  \nstay the injunction as to §106.2’s definition of hostile envi-\nronment harassment as applied to other forms of sex dis-\ncrimination, §106.2’s other definitions, §106.10, and the re-\nmainder of the Rule’s unchallenged provisions.  \nII  \n  I would grant most of the Government’s stay requests and \nleave enjoined only its enforcement of the three challenged \nprovisions.4   A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary” \nexercise of equitable authority, appropriate only “upon a \nclear showing” that a party is “entitled to such relief.”  Win-\nter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7,  \n22 (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must \nestablish, among other things, that it would likely suffer ir-\nreparable harm without equitable relief.  Ibid.  Even when  \na party makes that showing, though, a court must tailor eq-\nuitable relief to redress the party’s alleged injuries without \nburdening the defendant more than necessary.  See Mad-\nsen,  512  U. S.  at  765  (“[An]  injunction  [should  be]  no \nbroader than necessary to achieve its desired goals”); Ya-\nmasaki, 442 U. S. at 702 (explaining that “relief afforded \n[to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more burdensome than nec-\nessary to redress the complaining parties”).\n  Here, respondents’ alleged injuries flow from the chal-\nlenged provisions. Even assuming respondents established \nthat those provisions subject them to a threat of irreparable \nharm, enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule appears to \n—————— \n4For §106.2, I would leave enjoined only its definition of “hostile envi-\n \nronment harassment.” \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \ngo beyond what was necessary to redress those injuries. \n  Consider some of the unchallenged provisions.  The Rule \nrequires schools to provide “reasonable modifications” to \npregnant students, including but not limited to “breaks dur-\ning class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to  \nhealth needs associated with pregnancy or related condi-\ntions.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33887.  A separate provision prohibits \nschools from making a preemployment inquiry as to an ap-\nplicant’s marital status and limits the circumstances under \nwhich a school may make a preemployment inquiry as to an \napplicant’s sex.  Id., at 33896.  The Rule also mandates that \nschools prohibit staff and students from retaliating against \nstudents who file Title IX complaints, and provides the pro-\ncedure a school must follow upon receiving a complaint of \nretaliation. Ibid. Those provisions (like many others in the \nRule) do not reference gender identity discrimination or \nhostile environment harassment and bear no apparent re-\nlationship to respondents’ alleged injuries.  As litigation\nover the Rule proceeds, respondents might be able to show \nthose other portions of the Rule will irreparably harm them \nin a manner justifying further equitable relief. At this junc-\nture, however, enjoining the application of any other part of \nthe Rule needlessly impairs the Government from enforcing \nTitle IX and deprives potential claimants of protections \nagainst forms of sex discrimination not at issue in respond-\nents’ suit. \n  Respondents maintain that the Government must re-\nmain enjoined from enforcing the entire Rule because the \nchallenged provisions “permeate” it.  Respondents fail to ex-\nplain, however, why enjoining enforcement of the entire \nRule at this stage is necessary to redress their alleged inju-\nries.  As an initial matter, many unchallenged provisions \n(such as those governing preemployment inquiries about an \napplicant’s marital status or sex and prohibiting pregnancy \ndiscrimination) include no reference to gender identity dis-\n\n8  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \ncrimination or hostile environment harassment.  Respond-\nents offer nothing to justify preventing the Government \nfrom enforcing those parts of the Rule.  As for the provisions \nthat do incorporate the Department’s allegedly unlawful \ndefinitions of sex-based discrimination and harassment, re-\nspondents do not explain how those provisions would injure \nthem while the Government is enjoined from enforcing the \ndisputed definitions. Take the Rule’s requirement that em-\nployees be trained on “[t]he scope of conduct that consti-\ntutes sex discrimination under Title IX and this part, in-\ncluding the definition of sex-based harassment.”  89 Fed. \nReg. 33886.  Even respondents do not argue that the train-\ning requirement is itself unlawful.  With the challenged pro-\nvisions out of the picture, the “scope of conduct” under that \ntraining provision would exclude gender identity discrimi-\nnation and hostile environment harassment, the sources of \nrespondents’ alleged injuries.  If  there were any doubt on \nthis score, moreover, the Court could simply have excluded \nthe provision from its stay order.\n  Respondents further assert that the Rule would be un-\nworkable with the Government enjoined from applying its \ndefinition of sex discrimination. For 50 years, however, Ti-\ntle IX regulations have not defined sex discrimination, and \nrespondents offer no evidence that schools cannot comply\nwith their Title IX obligations without such a definition. \n*  *  * \n  By blocking the Government from enforcing scores of reg-\nulations that respondents never challenged and that bear \nno apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries, \nthe lower courts went beyond their authority to remedy the \ndiscrete harms alleged here.  The injunctions this Court \nleaves in place will burden the Government more than nec-\nessary. The injunctions will also affect the public.  Individ-\nuals in the respondent states will be deprived of guidance \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  9 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \nrelated to their rights under Title IX, of updates to the pro-\ncesses schools must follow in investigating their complaints \nof sex discrimination, of protections from retaliation should \nthey file a complaint, and of much more.  On the present \nrecord, more tailored relief focused on the three challenged \nprovisions would have redressed respondents’ alleged inju-\nries without depriving the public of the Rule’s other provi-\nsions.  Because  the  majority  of  this  Court  nonetheless \nleaves the overly broad injunctions in place, I respectfully \ndissent in part.  ",
