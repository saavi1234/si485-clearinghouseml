    "summary": "<p>This case involves an attempt to block new Title IX rules from going into effect. On April 19, 2024, the Biden administration introduced its \"Final Rule,\" which clarifies the interpretation of Title IX to broaden protections against sex discrimination in education. Texas filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on April 29, 2024, against the United States of America, the U.S. Secretary of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Enforcement in the Department of Education, alleging that the Final Rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it contradicted the plain language of Title IX, violated the First Amendment, and was arbitrary and capricious. Texas sought a declaratory judgment, vacatur of the Final Rule, and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk was assigned to the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Title IX, enacted in 1972, is a law that protects students from sex-based discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funding. The Biden Administration&rsquo;s rule, which went into effect on August 1, 2024, broadened what constitutes sex discrimination and expanded the definition of prohibited &ldquo;sex-based harassment.&rdquo; It gave LGBTQ+ students and others explicit protection from discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo; It also interpreted Title IX to ban discrimination against people who obtain abortions, and to require health insurance plans offered by educational institutions to include coverage for abortions. Texas argued that the Final Rule violated the APA because it was contrary to the meaning of Title IX and arbitrary and capricious. Further, Texas contended that the Final Rule's broader definition of harassment banned speech that was protected by the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>Texas filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2024, which added two plaintiffs (professors at the University of Texas at Austin) and added more specific APA claims based on the Final Rule's definition of \"sex-based harassment.\" The plaintiffs alleged that this violated the First Amendment's free speech protections because it discriminated based on content and viewpoint. They also alleged that this definition was overbroad, in violation of the First Amendment, and void for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They also argued that the Final Rule's alteration of procedures for those accused of sex-based harassment violated procedural due process. Finally, the plaintiffs contended that the Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious in various ways, in violation of the APA.</p>\r\n<p>On July 11, 2024, the court granted a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants not to enforce the Final Rule. The court found that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to prevail on the merits of their claims that the Final Rule was contrary to Title IX, was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause.&nbsp;740 F.Supp.3d 537.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2024, the defendants appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. However, on April 7, 2025, the defendants voluntarily dismissed their appeal. This case is ongoing as of April 2025.</p>",

      "text": "Case 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 1 of 30   PageID 1\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nAMARILLO DIVISION \n \nState of Texas,  \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nThe United States of America; \nMiguel Cardona, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of Education; \nNo. ___________ \nUnited States Department of \nEducation; Catherine Lhamon, in \nher official capacity as Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights, Department of Education; \nRandolph Wills, in his official capacity \nas Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement, Department of Education, \nDefendants.     \nState of Texas’s Original Complaint \n1.  Through  an  exercise  in  notice-and-comment  rulemaking  ordered  by \nPresident Biden, the U.S. Department of Education has attempted to effect radical social \nchange in our Nation’s schools by purporting to “interpret” Title IX of the Education \nAmendments Act of 1972 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. Stymied in its attempts  to  implement  this agenda through  informal agency \nguidance, and unable to amend Title IX through the legislative process, the Department \nhas now formally amended the Code of Federal Regulations. This Final Rule tells States \nand other regulated parties that they must ignore biological sex or face enforcement actions \nand the loss of federal education funding. \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 2 of 30   PageID 2\n2.  Contrary to the Department’s assertions, the Supreme Court’s decision in \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), does not require—or even allow—these \ninterpretations.  Bostock  held  only  that  terminating  an  employee  “simply  for  being \nhomosexual or transgender” constitutes discrimination “because of … sex” under Title \nVII. Id. at 649–51, 655 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)). The Court “assum[ed]” that \nthe term “sex” means “biological distinctions between male and female,” id. at 655, and it \nmade clear that its decision did not “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws \nthat prohibit sex discrimination” or address other issues not before the Court such as “sex-\nsegregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes.” Id. at 681.  \n3.  In addition, the new regulations promise to repeat the disaster that was the \nDepartment’s ill-advised 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, which had a detrimental impact on \npublicly funded education across the country, including in Texas. The Final Rule walks \nback many of the constitutional safeguards issued by the Trump Administration to ensure \nthat students accused of harassment have access to a fair hearing. At the same time, the \nFinal Rule redefines harassment to include constitutionally protected activity. Not only \ndoes this put Texas schools in a no-win situation—where adherence to the Constitution \nrisks the loss of federal funds—but students and faculty risk having their futures upended \nmerely for refusing to go along with the Biden Administration’s radical agenda.  \n4.  The Final Rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. It is substantively unlawful because its purported “interpretations” of Title IX \nsquarely conflict with the text of that statute. Title IX, by its plain text, defines “sex” as \n“one sex” that is male or female. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(5) (describing those institutions \nwhich  have  a  policy  of  admitting  “only  students  of  one  sex”).  The  Department  of \nEducation,  furthermore,  engaged  in  arbitrary-and-capricious  decisionmaking  when \npromulgating these regulations because it failed to define the amorphous concepts of \n“gender identity” and “sexual orientation,” failed to adequately consider all relevant \nfactors, and failed to adequately explain its reversal of past policies.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 3 of 30   PageID 3\n5.  Title IX does not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity. But even if those concepts were protected against discrimination by Title \nIX, the Final Rule’s provisions do not faithfully implement such protections because they \nmark as unlawful school policies that do not discriminate based on those concepts—\ninstead, the Final Rule requires schools to discriminate based on sexual orientation and \ngender identity by allowing single-sex programs and facilities but requiring opposite-sex \naccess to them for only those individuals with a transgender gender identity. \n6.  The Court should postpone the effective date of the Final Rule under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 and preliminarily enjoin the Defendants from implementing the Final Rule \nor interpreting Title IX to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. And the Court should ultimately declare and hold unlawful the Final Rule, set it \naside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (i.e., vacate it), and permanently enjoin the Defendants \nfrom implementing or enforcing it and from interpreting Title IX in this way. \nI.  Parties \n7.  Plaintiff Texas is a sovereign State of the United States.  \n8.  Defendant the United States of America is the federal sovereign and is sued \nunder 5 U.S.C §§ 702–03 and 28 U.S.C. § 1346.  \n9.  Defendant  Miguel  Cardona  is  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of \nEducation. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n10.  Defendant the Department of Education is a cabinet-level executive branch \ndepartment of the United States. It is responsible for administering most federal assistance \nto education; it administers and enforces Title IX. \n11.  Defendant Catherine Lhamon is the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at \nthe Department of Education. She is sued in her official capacity.  \n12.  Defendant  Randolph  Wills  is  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for \nEnforcement at the Department of Education. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 4 of 30   PageID 4\nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n13.  The Court has federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthis suit concerns the scope of the Department’s authority under Title IX, and it also arises \nunder the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–703.  \n14.  Venue  lies  in  this  district  under  28  U.S.C.  § 1391(e)(1)  because  the \nDefendants are agencies of the United States and officers of the United States in their \nofficial capacities; Texas resides in this district; and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to Texas’s claims arose in this district.  \nIII.  Background \nA. Prior Regulatory Context \n15.  During the Obama Administration, the Department issued its misguided \n2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence.  \nSee Russlynn Ali, OCR, U.S. Dept. of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter: Sexual Violence (Apr. \n4, 2011), https://bit.ly/4bgTX1Y; U.S. Dept. of Educ., Questions and Answers on Title IX \nand Sexual Violence (Apr. 29, 2014), https://bit.ly/44ixq2u. Although neither underwent \nnotice and comment rulemaking, the two guidance documents put recipients in a no-win \nsituation where either conforming or failing to conform to the guidance documents would \nexpose them to significant risk of litigation. \n16.  The  Dear  Colleague  Letter  and  2014  Questions  and  Answers  had  a \ndetrimental impact on publicly funded education nationwide, including in Texas. Not only \ndid  the  two  guidance  documents  introduce  significant  confusion  over  academic \ninstitutions’ obligations under Title IX, but they also created incentives for academic \ninstitutions to violate students’ constitutional rights in order to avoid incurring liability. To \noffer some context, before 2011, the number of lawsuits filed against universities for failing \nto provide due process in Title IX cases averaged one per year—by 2019, over 100 such \nlawsuits were filed in that year alone. See Taylor Mooney, How Betsy DeVos plans to change \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 5 of 30   PageID 5\nthe  rules  for  handling  sexual  misconduct  on  campus,  CBS  NEWS  (Nov.  24, \n2019), https://cbsn.ws/4dib1GD.  \n17.   In response to growing criticism, under the Trump Administration, the \nDepartment  rescinded  both  the  Dear  Colleague  Letter  and  the  2014  Questions  and \nAnswers in 2017. It soon became apparent, however, that the withdrawal could not repair \nthe damage caused by the two guidance documents on its own. See Candice Jackson, OCR, \nU.S. Dept. of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter (Sept. 9, 2017). As the Department later \nexplained, neither action “require[ed] or result[ed] in wholesale changes to the set of \nexpectations guiding recipients’ responses to sexual harassment.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,029. \nHence, many, if not most, recipients “chose not to change their Title IX policies and \nprocedures” as a precaution against stigma and liability. Id. \n18.  The  Department,  therefore,  initiated  a  round  of  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking,  after  which  it  published  a  comprehensive  set  of  regulations  governing \nrecipients’ obligations to prevent sex discrimination in their programs and activities. See \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal  Financial  Assistance,  85  Fed.  Reg.  30,026  (May  19,  2020)  (the  “2020 \nRegulations”). The 2020 Regulations took effect on August 14, 2020.  \n19.  The 2020 Regulations addressed at least three significant ambiguities in the \nearlier guidance:  \na.  First, the 2020 Regulations clearly demarcated, for the first time, the outer \nboundaries  of  recipients’  obligations  and  liability  under  Title  IX  with \nrespect to sexual harassment.  \nb.  Second, the 2020 Regulations clarified the standard under which conduct or \nspeech could constitute sex-based harassment—namely, that it be “so \nsevere,  pervasive,  and  objectively  offensive  that  it  effectively  denies a \nperson equal access.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,574.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 6 of 30   PageID 6\nc.  Third, the 2020 Regulations reaffirmed the primacy of the U.S. Constitution \nand  adopted  multiple  safeguards  to  ensure  that  Title  IX  enforcement \nprotected the rights and interests of all parties to a disciplinary proceeding. \n20.  The  2020  Regulations  also  addressed  the  question  of  whether \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” encompassed sexual orientation and gender identity. \nAlthough the Department declined to define “sex” in the 2020 Regulations because it was \nnot necessary to effectuate the rules and would have consequences that extended outside \nof the proposed rulemaking, the Department noted that “Title IX and its implementing \nregulations include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification.” It further \nobserved that “provisions in the Department’s current regulations, which the Department \ndid not propose to revise in this rulemaking, reflect this presupposition.” 85 Fed. Reg. at \n30,178.  \nB.  The Final Rule \n21.  From the start, President Biden opposed the 2020 Regulations, stating on \nthe campaign trail that he would order the Department to put a “quick end” to the 2020 \nRegulations if  elected. See Joe  Biden,  Statement on the Trump Administration Rule to \nUndermine Title IX and Campus Safety (May 6, 2020), http://bit.ly/3UDREj9.  \n22.  Not seven months after the 2020 Regulations became effective, President \nBiden followed through on that campaign promise. He issued an executive order charging \nthe Secretary of Education to review “all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, \npolicies, and any other similar agency actions” for consistency with his administration’s \nTitle  IX  policy.  Executive  Order  14021,  86  Fed.  Reg.  13,803  (Mar.  11,  2021), \nhttp://bit.ly/4aWLPUI.   \n23.  In that executive order, President Biden presupposed that “on the basis of \nsex” included sexual orientation or gender identity. Id. The Department conducted its \nreview and subsequent rulemaking bound by President Biden’s instruction that Title IX \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 7 of 30   PageID 7\nshould  be  interpreted  as  encompassing  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity \nnotwithstanding decades of precedent to the contrary. \n24.  On July 12, 2022, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice \nof  proposed  rulemaking  to  amend  the  2020  Regulations.  See  Notice  of  Proposed \nRulemaking, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022). Texas, \nthrough its Attorney General and Governor, submitted multiple comments before the 60-\nday comment period for the Proposed Rule closed on September 12, 2022.  \n25.  In its comments, Texas highlighted the burden the proposed regulations \nwould impose on the State, as well as the risk the regulations posed to constitutional rights. \nThe comments explained that the combination of expanding recipients’ obligation to \nrespond to sex discrimination, while simultaneously lowering the threshold of what fell \nwithin that description, meant, in practice, that recipients would hyper-police interactions \namong students, parents, and faculty for fear of being found noncompliant if individuals \naffiliated  with  the  recipient  failed  to  recognize  each  person’s  highly  individualized, \npotentially fluid, and unverifiable gender identity. \n26.  The comments further noted that much of proposed rule represented a \nsignificant departure from the Departments’ past policies, yet the changes were neither \nadequately explained nor grounded in the text, structure, or purpose of Title IX. As an \nexample, the Department hinged its redefinition of sex to include sexual orientation and \ngender identity almost entirely on the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock. However, \nas Texas pointed out in its comments, Bostock involved an unrelated statute that was \nenacted nearly a decade earlier, pursuant to a different constitutional power, and did not \naddress  questions  involving  “sex  segregated  bathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  dress \ncodes”— all of which were not before the Court but appeared in the proposed rule.  \n27.  Despite these deficiencies, the Department pushed forward and published \nthe Final Rule in the Federal Register on April 29, 2024. See Nondiscrimination on the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 8 of 30   PageID 8\nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. \nReg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024). The Final Rule purports to preempt all “State or local laws or \nother requirements” that conflict with its terms, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885, and it applies to \nany school “program or activity” regardless of whether the activity occurs within the \nschool— or even within the United States. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.11). \nRedefining “On the Basis of Sex” \n28.  Title IX states, “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, \nbe  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n29.  For the entire half century since its enactment, both the Department and \nrecipients have understood Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to refer to a \nperson’s biological sex. Notwithstanding this history, the Final Rule redefines Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, \nsex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender \nidentity.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). \n30.  In accordance with the Department’s reinvention of Title IX, the Final Rule \nthreatens to withhold federal funding from schools that do not allow students access to \n“restrooms and locker rooms” and comply with any “appearance codes (including dress \nand grooming codes)” based on gender identity. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816. The Final \nRule dictates that a school violates Title IX’s nondiscrimination prohibition if a transgender \nstudent is denied access to a bathroom or locker room of the opposite biological sex. See, \ne.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818.  \n31.  “The  Department  cannot  enforce  Title  IX  in  a  manner  that  requires \nrecipients to restrict any rights protected under the First Amendment.”85. Fed. Reg. \n30,071. But under the Final Rule, recipients have an obligation under the Final Rule to \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 9 of 30   PageID 9\n“take  specific  actions … to  promptly  and  effectively  prevent  sex  discrimination,” \nincluding what the Final Rule defines as sex-based harassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. It \nfollows that recipients would have an obligation under the Final Rule to confront students \nand employees who refuse to affirm someone’s gender identity, up to and including \ndisciplinary proceedings, or risk being found in noncompliance with Title IX. \n32.  The Final Rule also institutes a new, lower standard for sexual harassment. \nThe Final Rule stipulates that “[s]ex-based harassment, including harassment predicated \non sex stereotyping or gender identity, is covered by Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, \nsubjectively and objectively offensive, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny \na student’s ability to participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516 (emphasis added).  \n33.  In adopting this standard, the Final Rule expands Title IX’s prohibition on \nsex-based harassment, contrary to Supreme Court precedent. Compare, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. \n33,498, with Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 649–50 (1999).  \n34.  Under  Davis,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  Title  IX’s  proscriptions \nincluded sexual harassment “that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \ncan be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits \nprovided by the school.” 526 U.S. at 650. The Final Rule ignores this precedent and \ninstitutes a sweeping new standard that would subject students, faculty, and staff to \nonerous investigations if they fail to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns.  \n35.  The 2020 Regulations purposefully adopted the Davis standard, “to ensure \nthat speech and expression are prohibited only when their seriousness and impact avoid \nFirst Amendment concerns.” 85. Fed. Reg. 30142. The Final Rule departs from this policy \nbut fails to adequately justify the Department’s about-face; nor does it explain how the \nlooser standard conforms to the Constitution. The reason given by the Department is \nsimply that the Defendants “believe[] a broader standard is appropriate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,498. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 10 of 30   PageID 10\n36.  The Final Rule also lacks objective standards, making every complaint \nsubjective, not limited to those who visibly identify as transgender but broadly encompasses \nanyone who may even only temporarily or intermittently so identify, see Am. Psychiatric \nAss’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (defining \n“transgender” to include “individuals who transiently” identify one way), or those with \nnefarious intentions who are merely seeking access to a schoolgirls’ bathroom or locker \nroom for predatory purposes.  \n37.  The Final Rule is therefore ambiguous, overbroad, and vague, and fails to \nadequately notify schools of adequate compliance to avoid onerous investigations.  \nMisguided Reliance on Bostock \n38.  The Department lacks the legal justification to initiate and support such \nradical departures in the interpretation of Title IX. The Department rests its redefinition \nof sex discrimination almost entirely on the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock. But \nthat case’s “reasoning applies only to Title VII, as Bostock itself and [] subsequent cases \nmake clear.” L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.).  \n39.  To start with, Title VII prohibits employment discrimination “because of \nsuch individual’s … sex[],”42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), but Title IX prohibits education \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). The statutes thus contain \ndifferent language with different results for different contexts. Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. \nSupp. 3d 668, 675–84 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (Kacsmaryk, J.) (Bostock and its reasoning do not \napply to Title IX). And “Bostock … was limited only to Title VII itself” and “d[id] not \nstretch to [other statutes].” Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); \nsee also Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 808 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(holding that Bostock’s reasoning applies only to Title VII, and describing the argument that \nit applies to Title IX as “faulty”). \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 11 of 30   PageID 11\n40.  Defendants conflate Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis \nof sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), with Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because \nof … sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). But the Bostock court ruled that the phrase “because \nof” in Title VII mandated a sweeping but-for causation requirement. Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. The U.S. Supreme Court has tendered no such ruling regarding the phrase “on the \nbasis of sex” as used in Title IX.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). To the contrary. “On the basis of \nsex” references to one’s “biological sex.” It does not mean does not mean “on the basis of \ngender identity” or “on the basis of sexual orientation.”  \n41.  Indeed, even though Title IX provides that recipients of federal funding for \neducation programs or activities shall not discriminate “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a), Title IX explicitly authorizes separation based on sex in certain situations, \nincluding “maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, \nand specified single-sex educational institutions, organizations, activities, and scholarship \nawards, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). These exceptions presume—and only make sense in the \ncontext of—biological sex.  \n42.  In any event, the Final Rule misinterprets the holding of Bostock, 590 U.S. \n644, and the definition of “sex” discrimination adopted by the Bostock majority. Bostock \ndoes not hold that discrimination on account of “sexual orientation” or “gender identity” \nis discrimination on account of “sex.” Bostock holds only that Title VII’s prohibition on \n“sex” discrimination prohibits employers from firing or refusing to hire individuals “for \nbeing homosexual or transgender.”  \n43.  Bostock explains that an employer who fires an employee for conduct or \npersonal attributes that it would tolerate in a person of the opposite biological sex has made \nthe employee’s sex the “but-for cause” of his discharge, and that (in the Court’s view) \nautomatically violates the statutory command of Title VII. The Court explained: \nIf the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he \nis attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 12 of 30   PageID 12\nactions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer \nintentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s \nsex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or \ntake an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an \notherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the \nemployer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for \ntraits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. \nAgain,  the  individual  employee’s  sex  plays  an  unmistakable  and \nimpermissible role in the discharge decision. \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 660. \n44.  Bostock also makes clear that an employer does not violate Title VII or \nengage in “sex” discrimination if it fires an employee for conduct or personal attributes \nthat it would not tolerate in an employee of the opposite biological sex: \nTake  an  employer  who  fires  a  female  employee  for  tardiness  or \nincompetence or simply supporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the \nemployer would not have tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands \nsilent. \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 660 \n45.  Bostock does not prohibit employers (or anyone else) from discriminating on \naccount of sexual orientation or gender identity, so long as they do not engage in “sex” \ndiscrimination when doing so. For example, Bostock does not prohibit Title IX recipients \nfrom discriminating against bisexual students or individuals, so long as the covered entity \nregards bisexual behavior or orientation as equally unacceptable in a man or a woman. See, \ne.g., Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660; see also id. at 658 (“[F]iring [a] person for actions or attributes \nit would tolerate in an individual of another sex … discriminates against that person in \nviolation of Title VII.”). \n46.   Discrimination against bisexuals is certainly discrimination on account of \n“sexual orientation,” but it is not discrimination on account of “sex.”  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 13 of 30   PageID 13\n47.  Bostock  allows  discrimination  against  homosexual  or  transgender \nindividuals, so long as it is done pursuant to rules or policies that apply equally to both sexes \nand would lead to the same result if the individual’s biological different were different. \n48.   A  teacher  or  professor,  for  example,  may  refuse  to  accommodate  a \ntransgender or non-binary student’s demands to be referred to by the singular pronoun \n“they”—so long as the teacher or professor refuses demands for such pronoun usage on \nequal terms from a biological male or a biological woman, and would equally refuse to honor \nthe transgender or non-binary student’s request if that student’s biological sex were \ndifferent.  \n49.  Even if the Department considers policies or practices of that sort to be \nregarded as discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, they do not \nconstitute “sex” discrimination as defined in Bostock because the rules apply equally to \nboth biological sexes. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 669 (“We agree that homosexuality and \ntransgender status are distinct concepts from sex.”). \n50.  The  Final  Rule  wrongly  equates  discrimination  on  account  of  sexual \norientation and gender identity with “sex” discrimination. Yet there are many ways in \nwhich  entities  covered  by  Title  IX  can  discriminate  against  homosexual,  bisexual, \ntransgender, or non-binary individuals without engaging in “sex” discrimination as defined \nin Bostock. \n51.  The Final Rule further conflicts with the reasoning of Bostock because that \ncase did not find that all sex-based distinctions were prohibited. Bostock repeatedly cited \nthe Court’s earlier decision in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), \nas authority. Oncale explained that Title VII “does not reach genuine but innocuous \ndifferences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex \nand  of  the  opposite  sex,”  and  “requires  neither  asexuality  nor  androgyny  in  the \nworkplace.” Id. at 81. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 14 of 30   PageID 14\n52.  The Oncale Court noted the central concern of Title VII was not every aspect \nof  interaction  in  the  workplace  but  “whether  members  of  one  sex  are  exposed  to \ndisadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are \nnot exposed.” Id. at 80 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) \n(Ginsburg, J., concurring)).  \n53.  The Second Circuit—in one of the cases consolidated with and affirmed in \nBostock—also favorably cites Oncale as “arguably” supporting the view that “sex-specific \nbathroom and grooming policies [do not] impose disadvantageous terms or conditions” \nbecause not all distinctions of “‘sexual content or connotations’  rise  to  the  level  of \ndiscrimination.” Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 119 & n.16 (2d Cir. 2018) (en \nbanc) (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79–80)); see also West v. Radtke, 48 F.4th 836, 849 (7th \nCir. 2022) (finding Title VII would not be violated by preventing transgender prison guard \nfrom performing strip searches of opposite-sex inmates). \n54.  Relatedly, Bostock also cautioned that “Title VII does not concern itself with \neverything that happens ‘because of’ sex,” 590 U.S. at 657—only discrimination that is \n“inextricably” related to sex is forbidden; distinctions “related to sex in some vague \nsense” or having only “some disparate impact on one sex or the other” are not reached by \nthe statute. Id. at 660–61. \n55.  Bostock did not overturn any Supreme Court precedents, instead resting on \nthose dating to the 1970s. It also did not disturb lower-court precedent that has long applied \nthose same precedents. “[T]the Court relied in Bostock on the same well established Title \nVII principles that animated the outcome in those prior decisions [of lower courts that \napplied  the  same  key  precedents,  so  those  courts]  effectively  anticipated  Bostock’s \nrationale.” Maner v. Dignity Health, 9 F.4th 1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2021) (Bea, J.) (explaining \nBostock  did  not  overturn  decades  of  lower-court  precedents  rejecting  “paramour \npreference” theory of liability). \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 15 of 30   PageID 15\n56.  This is consistent with Willingham v. Macon Tel. Publ’g Co., 507 F.2d 1084 \n(5th Cir. 1975) (en banc), which upheld sex-specific grooming codes under Title VII. \nWillingham applied Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971), one of the key \ncases the Supreme Court relied on in Bostock. The Second Circuit in Zarda— which relied \non the same key precedents that the Supreme Court would later adopt in Bostock (Martin \nMarietta and L.A. Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978))—favorably cited \nWillingham as consistent with its analysis, 883 F.3d at 118–19. \n57.  In  short,  Bostock  did  not  nullify  the  Supreme  Court’s  longstanding \nacceptance of differences between the sexes. It did not question any longstanding precedent \nbeyond the narrow question before it: whether “[a]n employer who fires an individual \nmerely for being gay or transgender defies the law.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 683 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe Clear Statement Rule  \nand the Major Questions Doctrine \n58.  Even if there were ambiguity on whether Title IX adopts the Final Rule’s \ndefinition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” that ambiguity must be resolved in favor \nof the State because conditions on federal funding must be stated clearly. Adams, 57 F.4th \nat 815.  \n59.  Congress enacted Title IX pursuant to its powers under the Spending \nClause. Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 (“[W]e have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislation \nenacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause[.]”). If Congress \nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal funding under Title IX, it must do so \nwith “a clear voice,” “unambiguously.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \n60.  This clear statement rule is required when imposing a condition on federal \nfunding because “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature \nof a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 16 of 30   PageID 16\nconditions.”  Adams,  57  F.4th  at  815  (citing  Pennhurst  State  School  and  Hospital  v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). “Recipients cannot knowingly accept the deal with the \nFederal Government unless they would clearly understand the obligations that would come \nalong with doing so.” Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, PLLC, 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) \n(internal quotations omitted).  \n61.  The use of the word “sex” in Title IX did not put educational institutions \nand  programs  on  notice  that  by  accepting  funding  from  the  federal  government  for \neducational services and activities, they are prohibited from providing bathrooms or other \nfacilities for the two sexes. See Adams, 57 F.4th at 816. That is clear not only from historical \npractice but from Defendants’ longstanding interpretation of Title IX and its implementing \nregulations, which “include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification.” 85 \nFed. Reg. at 30,178. \n62.  Similarly, courts will not assume that Congress has assigned questions of \n“deep economic and political significance” to an agency unless Congress has done so \nexpressly. See King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015); FDA v. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000).  \n63.   “We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to \nexercise powers of vast economic and political significance.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t \nof Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Grp. \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)).  \n64.  “Congress typically [does not] use oblique or elliptical language to empower \nan agency to make a radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme …We presume \nthat Congress intends to make major policy decisions itself, not leave those decisions to \nagencies.” Id. (cleaned up); see also Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 160.  \n65.  The  Final  Rule  will  affect  all  elementary  schools,  secondary  schools, \npostsecondary institutions, and other recipients of federal financial funds with far-reaching \nsocial and economic impact. Yet Title IX’s language cannot be plausibly read to smuggle in \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 17 of 30   PageID 17\na power for federal agencies to overturn the “unremarkable—and nearly universal—\npractice[s]” common in States’ governance of schools. Adams, 57 F.4th at 796. \nIf Bostock Applies to Title IX,  \nthe Final Rule Violates It \n66.  In addition, even if Title IX covered discrimination on the bases of sexual \norientation and gender identity, the Final Rule interprets Title IX’s anti-discrimination \nprovision as requiring accommodations for gender identity even though Title IX—unlike \nTitle  VII’s  prohibition  on  religious  discrimination  and  the  disability  discrimination \nprovisions of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act—has no \naccommodation requirement.   \n67.  The Final Rule requires exceptions from admittedly lawful sex-segregated \npolicies and facilities for those whose gender identity is transgender—and only for them, \nas schools would still be allowed to prevent biological males who do not identify as women \nfrom entering female-only spaces and programs. See Fed. Reg. at 33,818 (under Final Rule, \n“sex separation in certain circumstances, including in the context of bathrooms or locker \nrooms, is not presumptively unlawful sex discrimination” but when a school “denies a \ntransgender  student  access  to  a  sex-separate  facility  or  activity  consistent  with  that \nstudent’s  gender  identity,  this  would  violate  Title  IX’s  general  nondiscrimination \nmandate”); id. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31: where Title IX permits \n“different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex,” the \nFinal Rule requires “sex” to be determined by gender identity); id. at 33,820 (reasoning \nthat non-transgender students are not harmed by being denied access to sex-separated \nfacilities such as restrooms and locker rooms, so only transgender students are protected \nby the new 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) that prohibits “more than de minimis harm”). \n68.  Consider standard bathroom norms. All biological males, regardless of their \ngender identity, may use the men’s bathroom; all biological females, regardless of their \ngender identity, may use the women’s bathroom. “Separating bathrooms based on sex \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 18 of 30   PageID 18\ndates back as far as written history will take us,” long before the concept of gender identity \neven existed. Adams, 3 F.4th at 1328 (Pryor, C.J., dissenting) (cleaned up), rev’d, 57 F.4th \n791.  These policies do not even consider “gender identity,” and therefore cannot be \ndescribed as discriminating based on that category. Cf. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (“[I]f no part of the hiring decision turned on [the applicant’s] status as \ndisabled, he cannot, ipso facto, have been subject to disparate treatment”). “Separating \nbathrooms by sex treats people differently on the basis of sex … [but] the mere act of \ndetermining an individual’s sex, using the same rubric for both sexes, does not treat anyone \ndifferently on the basis of sex.” Adams, 3 F.4th at 1325–26 (Pryor, C.J., dissenting). \n69.  The Final Rule purports to allow sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers (explicitly) and sex-specific dress codes and pronoun usage policies (implicitly) \nas a general matter. But it then “tr[ied] to work around [those concessions] with a linguistic \ndevice.” Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 723 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Williams, J., concurring in \nthe result) (criticizing plaintiffs’ concession that military may have sex-specific standards \nwhile arguing that “sex” should be determined by subjective gender identity). It is no \nconsolation to tell schools they can still have sex-specific bathrooms (or dress codes or \npronoun usage) so long as they allow exceptions for individuals who subjectively identify \nas the opposite sex. \n70.  If schools may have separate facilities or policies for men and women, as the \nFinal Rule concedes, then they may also require compliance with those policies. Cf. \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts § 30, at \n192–93 (2012) (“[W]henever a power is given by a statute, everything necessary to making \nit effectual or requisite to attaining the end is implied.”) (citation omitted). The same is true \nfor sex-specific dress codes or allowing the use of gendered pronouns as part of standard \nEnglish in schools; such policies do not classify based on the gender identity of anyone but \ndisregard that concept altogether, exactly as Bostock requires. Indeed, to allow schools to \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 19 of 30   PageID 19\nhave sex-specific policies, but then require them to have exemptions only for transgender \nemployees, violates Bostock because such a rule discriminates based on gender identity. \nC. The Final Rule’s Irreparable Harm to Texas \nTexas is harmed by the Final Rule in several ways. \nObject of the Regulation  \n71.  Texas administers numerous education programs and operates thousands \nof educational institutions through its constituent agencies and political subdivisions, \nincluding programs and institutions that receive federal funding and are subject to Title IX \nand its effectuating regulations.  \n72.  The Texas Constitution charges the Texas Legislature “to establish and \nmake suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public \nfree schools.” Tex. Const. art. VII, § 1.  \n73.  Pursuant to this charge, Texas funds, regulates, and oversees the Nation’s \nsecond-largest K–12 public education system, serving over 5.4 million students across \n1,200 school districts. Tex. Educ. Agency, Enrollment in Texas Public Schools 2021-22 at ix \n(June 2022), http://bit.ly/3WcXeeC.  \n74.  In the 2021-2022 biennium, Texas received approximately $6.6 billion \ndollars in federal funds for its K-12 education. Tex. Educ. Agency, 2022 Comprehensive \nBiennial Report on Texas Public Schools at 239 (Dec. 2020), https://bit.ly/4a2Y9Bw.  \n75.  Texas also funds, supports, and administers a robust higher education \nnetwork. Texas is home to 119 public postsecondary institutions, including 37 universities \nand 82 two-year colleges and technical schools. See Tex. Higher Educ. Coordinating Bd., \n2020  Texas  Public  Higher  Education  Almanac  at  28,  47  (Sept.  28,  2020), \nhttps://bit.ly/3wguAP9.  \n76.  While most States have just one or two public university systems, Texas has \nsix. The largest of these systems—the University of Texas—has 14 separate locations that \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 20 of 30   PageID 20\neducate approximately 256,000 students each year. See About The University of Texas \nSystem,  THE  UNIVERSITY  OF  TEXAS  SYSTEM,  https://www.utsystem \n.edu/about. All told, the State’s entire higher education network enrolled almost 1.7 million \nstudents in 2019. See 2020 Texas Public Higher Education Almanac, supra, at 13.  \n77.  Public  postsecondary  education  institutions  in  Texas  received \napproximately $2.5 billion in federal funding during fiscal year 2022. \n78.  As a condition of receiving federal funding, Title IX protections against sex-\nbased discrimination apply to state educational institutions. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Hence, \nshould  Texas,  or  any  of  Texas’s  affiliated  academic  institutions,  deviate  from  the \nDepartment’s guidance effectuating Title IX, that departure would invite enforcement \nactions at the risk of significant monetary penalties, up to and including the loss of federal \nmoney. \n79.  Texas educational institutions rely on federal funding and will be irreparably \nharmed if they lose their funding because of their reliance on 50 years of Title IX practice \nand legal precedent interpreting “on the basis of sex” to mean biological sex, not “sexual \norientation” and “gender identity.”  \n80.  It  is  a  “fundamental  canon  of  statutory  construction”  that,  “unless \notherwise  defined, words  will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, \ncommon meaning” at the time of enactment. Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 \n(2014) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)); Scalia & Garner, supra, at \n16 (same).  \n81.  No dictionary at the time Title IX was enacted defined “sex” to include \n“gender identity” or “sexual orientation.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 812–13. \n82.  Texas, relying on the contemporary (and etymological) meaning of “sex” \nwhen Title IX was enacted, adopted laws, policies, and procedures, and significantly \ninvested in an entire infrastructure to implement its education systems. The Final Rule \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 21 of 30   PageID 21\nupends these important  reliance interests  and usurps Texas’s sovereignty by adding \n“gender identity” and “sexual orientation.”  \n83.  The  Final  Rule  refuses  to  define  “gender  identity”  and  “sexual \norientation,” nor whether both fixed and fluid identities and orientations are protected.   \n84.  The Final Rule’s protections for an ever-fluctuating number of gender \nidentities and sexual orientations, which individuals can allegedly change at any time, \nanywhere, and for any reason, undermines Title IX’s original sex-based protections. See \nUnited States v. Varner, 948 F.3d 250, 256–58 (5th Cir. 2020) (examining bewildering \nassortment of purported gender identities and bespoke pronouns). \n85.  Texas  independent  school  districts  and  Texas  public  universities  are \ninstrumentalities of the State. See, e.g., Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 \nS.W.3d 653, 660 (Tex. 2008). \n86.  Federal funding allocated to Texas’s post-secondary public universities, \ntechnical educational institutions, health-related educational institutions, and community \ncolleges is managed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB).  \n87.  In fiscal year 2022, Texas public universities received more than $3.8 billion \nin federal funding; Texas community colleges received more than $2.1 billion in federal \nfunds; Texas technical educational institutions received more than $100 million in federal \nfunds; and Texas health-related educational institutions received more than $1.5 billion in \nfederal funds. See Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Sources and Uses Report, \nAccessed April 27, 2024, at https://bit.ly/3QmFLww. \n88.  The  Final  Rule  threatens  to  withdraw  federal  funding  from  Texas \neducational  institutions.  The  Department  may  pursue  enforcement  actions  against \neducational facilities that are out of compliance with its aberrant interpretation of Title IX \nand penalize any institution deemed non-compliant by withholding funds. See U.S.C. \n§§ 1681, 1682. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 22 of 30   PageID 22\n89.  Complying with Title IX costs Texas money. Texas educational institutions \nundertake internal efforts to ensure compliance with Title IX, including federal regulations \npromulgated pursuant to Title IX. These efforts involve but are not exhausted by hiring \nstaff to perform compliance reviews, facilitate the Title IX grievance process, and respond \nto lawsuits that stem from allegations of liability under Title IX protections. \n90.  These and other compliance efforts incur considerable expense to State \neducational facilities. The costs of complying with Title IX will likely increase when the \nDepartment of Education adopts new regulations that create additional requirements or \nmake existing requirements more demanding.  \n91.  Even the Department’s low regulatory cost estimates reveal a substantial \nmonetary burden on state educational facilities. Overall, the Department estimates more \nthan $98 million in short-term compliance costs, some of which will fall on Texas schools. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,861. \n92.  Further aspects of the Department’s regulatory burden analysis reflect an \narbitrary and capricious consideration of relevant information. The Department failed to \nadequately consider how expanding Title IX to apply to gender identity would impose new \nregulatory burdens on recipients. With no reasonable explanation, the Department asserts \nthat extending Title IX protections to an entirely new class will not add new compliance \ncosts or create additional liability. See id. at 33,876.  \n93.  Contrary  to  the  Department,  responsible  deliberation  during  the \nrulemaking phase would have concluded that expanding Title IX’s anti-discrimination \nmandate to cover gender identity will likely increase costs for recipients, including Texas \neducational institutions.  \n94.  Nor could the Department have reasonably concluded that the new rule \nwould not interfere with local and State governments “in the exercise of their governmental \nfunctions.” Id. at 33,859.  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 23 of 30   PageID 23\nExpansion of Liability under Title IX \n95.  Educational institutions are subject to liability for alleged violations of Title \nIX. See generally, Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979); Fitzgerald v. Barnstable \nSch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, (2009). The Final Rule forces a waiver of Texas’s sovereign \nimmunity as to certain regulatory requirements without its consent. \n96.  The Final Rule greatly expands the scope of Title IX protections, thereby \nexpanding the range of conduct that could give rise to a lawsuit against Texas educational \ninstitutions.  \n97.  The  Department’s  decision  to  change  the  definition  of  “sexual \nharassment” from one grounded in a solely objective standard to one based on a hybrid \nobjective and subjective standard, see 89 Fed. Reg. 33,511, 33,885, opens the door to an \nupsurge of sexual harassment lawsuits brought against Texas educational facilities. \n98.  To  comply  with  the  Final  Rule,  Texas  educational  facilities  must \nsubstantially overhaul their existing practices regarding Title IX grievances.   \n \nInfringement on Texas’s sovereignty  \n99.  The Final Rule injures Texas by obstructing its sovereign authority to \nenforce and administer its laws and by imposing substantial pressure on Texas to change \nits laws and policies.  See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982) (impeding a state’s sovereign interest in creating and enforcing a legal code \nwas an injury-in-fact sufficient to find standing); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 153 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[S]tates may have standing based on (1) federal assertions of \nauthority to regulate matters they believe they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, \nand (3) federal interference with the enforcement of state law[.]”). \n100.  The Final Rule also conflicts with the policies adopted by some of Texas’s \npolitical subdivisions—pursuant to authority granted by state law—regarding separating \nschool bathrooms and locker rooms by biological sex.  For example, the Carroll, Frisco, and \nGrapevine–Colleyville Independent School Districts require schools owned or operated by \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 24 of 30   PageID 24\nthe districts to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, shower rooms, and other similar facilities \nbased on biological sex determined at birth and correctly identified on a person’s birth \ncertificate.   \n101.  The Final Rule conflicts with each of these policies by treating them as \nunlawful sex discrimination and by requiring school districts to change their policies to \nseparate  bathrooms,  locker  rooms,  showers,  and  changing  facilities  based  on  gender \nidentity instead of biological sex to remain in compliance with the Rule.  See 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). \n102.  The Final Rule requires using pronouns that are consistent with a person’s \ngender identity rather than biological sex, which conflicts with policies adopted by some of \nTexas’s political subdivisions and is not required by Texas state law. For example, the \nCarroll and Grapevine–Colleyville Independent School Districts have adopted policies that \nprohibit district employees from requiring the use of pronouns that are inconsistent with a \nperson’s biological sex as correctly identified on a person’s birth certificate or other \ngovernment-issued record.   \n103.  The Final Rule conflicts with these policies by treating them as unlawful sex \ndiscrimination and by requiring school districts to change their policies to use pronouns \nbased on a person’s gender identity instead of biological sex to remain in compliance with \nthe Final Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). Compliance \nwith the Final Rule would expose the school districts to liability for violating district \nemployees’ and students’ religious freedom and free speech rights, despite district policies \nprotecting those rights. \n104.  The Final Rule also conflicts with the policies adopted by some of Texas’s \npolitical subdivisions regarding school library materials and other instructional resources. \nFor example, Granbury Independent School District has adopted policies regarding the \navailability of vulgar material in its libraries which arguably conflicts with the Department’s \nintended enforcement of the Rule.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 25 of 30   PageID 25\n105.  Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District has adopted a policy \nprohibiting district personnel and agents from teaching, instructing, training, or otherwise \npromoting gender fluidity.  \n106.  Keller Independent School District has adopted a policy prohibiting the \ninclusion of discussion or depiction of gender fluidity in its instructional resources and \nlibrary materials.   \n107.  The Final Rule conflicts with each of the policies by treating them as \nunlawful sex discrimination and by requiring school districts to change their policies to \npromote gender fluidity to remain in compliance with the Final Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10).  \n108.  The Final Rule explicitly preempts contrary state laws and directs recipients \nof Title IX funding to comply with the Final Rule in the event of a conflict with state law.  \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.6). These injuries are sufficient \nto establish Texas’s standing. \n109.  Texas’s injuries are directly traceable to the Final Rule. They would be \nredressed  by  the  relief  sought  in  this  case,  which  includes  preliminarily  enjoining \nDefendants from enforcing the Final Rule and vacating it in its entirety. See Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir. 2019). \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 26 of 30   PageID 26\nIV.  Claims \nCount I \nThe Final Rule Exceeds Statutory Authority  \nand is Not in Accordance with Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n110.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n111.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory … authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” See \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  \n112.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law and exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority because it relies upon the interpretation of Title VII described in Bostock \nand applies it to Title IX, despite the textual and structural differences between the two \nstatutes and the express disclaimer in Bostock that its holding did not apply to other federal \nor state laws. \n113.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law and exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority because the plain language of Title IX and its implementing regulations \nallow recipients of federal education funds to distinguish between biological males and \nbiological females in situations the Final Rule condemns. And the correct interpretation of \nTitle IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” does not include protections \nfor the concepts of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n114.  The  Final  Rule  is  also  not  in  accordance  with  law  and  exceeds  the \nDepartment’s  statutory  authority  because  it  compels  recipients  to  violate  the  First \nAmendment to remain compliant with Title IX. Specifically, the Final Rule discards the \ndefinition of sexual harassment initially articulated in Davis and adopted by the Department \nin its 2020 rulemaking, in favor of a weaker standard that encompasses constitutionally \nprotected activity.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 27 of 30   PageID 27\n115.  The Final Rule also expands recipients’ liability far beyond what Title IX \nallows, such as by reinterpreting the word “sex” to include “sexual orientation” and \n“gender identity.” Hence, not only does the Final Rule fundamentally rewrite Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex-based discrimination, but the failure to affirm a student’s gender identity \nwould constitute “sex-based harassment.” See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884.  \n116.  Recipients  have  an  obligation  under  the  Final  Rule  to  “take  specific \nactions … to promptly and effectively prevent sex discrimination,” including what the \nFinal Rule defines as sex-based harassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. It follows that recipients \nwould have an obligation under the Final Rule to confront students and employees who \nrefuse to affirm someone’s gender identity, up to and including disciplinary proceedings, \nor risk being found in noncompliance with Title IX.  \n117.  Defendants did not act in accordance with the law and exceeded their \nstatutory and regulatory authority when promulgating the Final Rule, and they do not act \nin accordance with the law and exceed their statutory and regulatory authority when \nenforcing the policies set forth in these regulations.  \nCount II \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n118.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n119.  The Final Rule is final agency action subject to review under the APA. \n“Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on \nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter \nto the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \ndifference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., \nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 28 of 30   PageID 28\n120.  “[A]gency action” is “the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, \nsanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). \nAn agency “rule” is defined as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or \nparticular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law \nor policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” \nId. at § 551(4).  \n121.  An  agency  action  is  arbitrary  or  capricious  if  it  fails  to  “articulate  a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. Under the APA, a court must \n“hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary and capricious.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n122.  Defendants did not engage in reasoned decisionmaking, but instead acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the Final Rule.  \n123.  Defendants dismissed case law that recognized that “Bostock … was limited \nonly to Title VII itself” and “does not stretch to [other statutes].” Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, \nInc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668 (N.D. Tex. \n2022) (Kacsmaryk, J.); compare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,806.   \n124.  The Final Rule also fails to adequately consider the effects of its terms on \nthe States. See generally 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474–33,896. \n125.  Defendants expressly “decline[d] to opine on how [the Final Rule] interacts \nor conflicts with any specific State laws because it would require a fact-specific analysis,” \nand instead “refer[red] the public to § 106.6(b), which affirms that a [school’s] obligation \nto comply with Title IX and the regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or \nlocal  law.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  33,822.  This  does  not  satisfy  Defendants’  obligation  to \n“adequately assess reliance interests” or “reasonably consider[] the relevant issues and \nreasonably explain[] the decision.” Texas v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 552, 555 (5th Cir. 2021).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 29 of 30   PageID 29\n126.  The  Final  Rule  also  fails  to  adequately  articulate  its  departure  from \nestablished Supreme Court precedent related to sex-based harassment, as well as previous \npolicies adopted by the Department in previous rulemakings. \nV.  Demand for Relief \nThis Court is authorized to award the requested vacatur and declaratory and \ninjunctive relief under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, and 706; 28 U.S.C. § 1361; the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202; Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 \nand 65; and the general and legal equitable powers of the Court. For these reasons, Texas \nrespectfully requests that the Court: \ni.  Postpone the effective date of the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and hold \nunlawful and set aside (i.e., vacate) the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); \nii.  Declare that the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX and exceeds agency authority; \niii.  Declare that the Final Rule was not a result of in reasoned decisionmaking but \nis instead arbitrary and capricious; \niv.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from \ninterpreting or enforcing Title IX as barring discrimination based on sexual \norientation  or  gender  identity—including  by  denying  federal  financial \nassistance or by otherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, \nassessments,  investigations,  or  other  enforcement  actions—and  from \nenforcing, implementing, or relying on the Final Rule against the State of Texas \n(including any of its instrumentalities, agencies, and political subdivisions); and \nv.  Award such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \n \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 1   Filed 04/29/24    Page 30 of 30   PageID 30\nDated: April 29, 2024.

Through an exercise in notice-and-comment rulemaking ordered by President \nBiden, the U.S. Department of Education (the “Department”) has attempted to effect \nradical social change in our Nation’s schools by purporting to “interpret” Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity. Stymied in its attempts to implement this agenda through informal \nagency guidance, and  unable to amend  Title IX through the legislative process, the \nDepartment  has  now  formally  amended  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations. \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving Fed. Fin. \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 2 of 66   PageID 78\nAssistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt 106) (the \n“Final Rule”). The Final Rule tells States and other regulated parties to ignore biological \nsex or face enforcement actions and the loss of federal education funding. \n2.  Contrary to the Department’s assertions, the Supreme Court’s decision in \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), does not require—or even allow—the \nreinterpretation of “on the basis of sex” to include to sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. Bostock held only that terminating an employee “simply for being homosexual or \ntransgender” constitutes discrimination “because of … sex” under Title VII. Id. at 649–\n51, 655 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)). The Court “assum[ed]” that the term “sex” \nmeans “biological distinctions between male and female,” id. at 655, and it made clear that \nits decision did not “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex \ndiscrimination” or address other issues not before the Court such as “sex-segregated \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes.” Id. at 681. See also id. at 669 (“We agree that \nhomosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex.”). \n3.  In  addition,  the  Final  Rule  promises  to  repeat  the  disaster  that  was  the \nDepartment’s ill-advised 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, which had a detrimental impact on \npublicly funded education across the country, including in Texas. The Final Rule walks \nback many of the constitutional safeguards issued by the Trump Administration to ensure \nthat students accused of harassment have access to a fair hearing. At the same time, the \nFinal Rule redefines harassment to include constitutionally protected activity. Not only \ndoes this put Texas schools in a no-win situation—where adherence to the Constitution \nrisks the loss of federal funds—but students and faculty risk having their futures upended \nmerely for refusing to go along with the Biden Administration’s radical social agenda.  \n4.  The Final Rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. It is substantively unlawful because its purported “interpretations” of Title IX \nsquarely conflict with the text of that statute. Title IX, by its plain text, defines “sex” as \n“one sex” that is male or female. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(5) (describing those institutions \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 3 of 66   PageID 79\nwhich  have  a  policy  of  admitting  “only  students  of  one  sex”).  The  Department, \nfurthermore,  engaged  in  arbitrary-and-capricious  decision-making  when  promulgating \nthese regulations because it failed to define the amorphous concepts of “gender identity” \nand “sexual orientation,” failed to adequately consider all relevant factors, and failed to \nadequately explain its reversal of past policies.  \n5.  Title IX does not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. But even if those concepts were protected against discrimination by Title IX, the \nFinal Rule’s provisions do not faithfully implement such protections because they mark as \nunlawful school policies that do not discriminate based on those concepts—instead, the \nFinal Rule requires schools to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity \nby allowing single-sex programs and facilities but requiring opposite-sex access to them for \nonly those individuals purporting to have a transgender identity. \n6.  The Court should postpone the effective date of the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705 (i.e., stay it) and preliminarily enjoin the Defendants from implementing the Final \nRule or interpreting Title IX to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. And the Court should ultimately declare and hold unlawful the Final Rule, set it \naside under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (i.e., vacate it), and permanently enjoin the Defendants \nfrom implementing or enforcing this unlawful reinterpretation of Title IX.  \nI.  Parties \n7.  Plaintiff Texas is a sovereign State of the United States.  \n8.   Plaintiff Daniel A. Bonevac is a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, \nwho is subject to the requirements of Title IX in his capacity as an educator and scholar.  \n9.  Plaintiff John Hatfield is a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who \nis subject to the requirements of Title IX in his capacity as an educator and a scholar. \n10. Defendant the United States of America is the federal sovereign and is sued \nunder 5 U.S.C §§ 702–03 and 28 U.S.C. § 1346.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 4 of 66   PageID 80\n11.

The Court has federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \nsuit concerns the scope of the Department’s authority under Title IX, and it also arises \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act., 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–703. Additionally, this court \nhas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346 because this suit involves a claim against an agency \nand employee of the federal government. \n16. Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because the Defendants \nare agencies of the United States and officers of the United States in their official capacities; \nTexas resides in this district; and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nTexas’s claims arose in this district.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 5 of 66   PageID 81\nIII.  Background \n17. President Nixon signed Title IX into law on June 23, 1972. See Act of June 23, \n1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, 373–75 (codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq.). Title \nIX provides that: \n \n“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance[.]” \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nA. Early Interpretations of Title IX adopted a biology-based approach. \n18.  The Department’s predecessor agency1 first issued regulations implementing \nTitle IX in 1975. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 106. These regulations treated sex as a binary, referring \nmultiple times to “one sex,” especially versus “the other sex,” using the phrase “both \nsexes,” and referencing “boys and girls” and “male and female teams.” See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. \n106.33, 106.34(a)(3), 106.36(c), 106.37(a)(3), 106.41(c), 106.51(a)(4), 106.58(a), 106.60(b), \n106.61; see also 34 C.F.R. pt. 86 (1975).  \n19. This  makes  sense,  as  Title  IX’s  test  and  structure  presuppose  sexual \ndimorphism—requiring equal treatment for each sex. See, e.g., Neese v. Becerra, No. 2:21-\ncv-163-Z, 2022 WL 1265925, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2022) (“Title IX presumes sexual \ndimorphism in section after section, requiring equal treatment for each ‘sex.’”) \n20. Indeed, at the time of its enactment, the term “sex” in Title IX referred to a \nperson’s  immutable  biological  sex—male  or  female.  See  Webster’s  Third  New \nInternational Dictionary (1966) (“One of the two divisions of organic, especially human \nbeings, respectively designated male or female.”); American Heritage Dictionary (1969) \n(“a.  The  property  or  quality  by  which  organisms  are  classified  according  to  their \n \n1  See  Nondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  Under  Federally  Assisted  Education \nPrograms and Activities, 40 Fed. Reg. 24, 128 (Jun. 4, 1975) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 86).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 6 of 66   PageID 82\nreproduction functions. b. Either of two divisions, designated male and female, of this \nclassification.”); Webster’s New World Dictionary (1972) (“[E]ither of the two divisions, \nmale or female, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their \nreproductive functions.”).  \n21. The structure of Title IX underscores that “sex” means biological sex—not \ngender identity or any other distinct concept. The statute explicitly permits educational \ninstitutions to maintain separate living facilities for the different sexes. 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \nThis  provision  only  makes  sense  if  “sex”  refers  to  the  male-female  binary  and  the \nassociated  physiological  differences.  Indeed,  Senator  Bayh  emphasized  that  Title  IX \npermitted “differential treatment by sex” when necessary, such as “in sport facilities or \nother instances where personal privacy must be preserved.” 118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (Feb. 28, \n1972) (Statement of Sen. Birch Bayh).2  \n22. While Title IX generally prohibits discrimination based on biological sex, it \nrecognizes situations where differentiation is appropriate. For instance, it exempts single-\nsex organizations like fraternities, sororities, the Boy Scouts of America, and Boy or Girl \nconferences to maintain their exclusivity. 20 U.S.C.A. § 1681(a)(6)-(7). Traditional single-\n \n2 Title IX is full of examples of “sex” being referred to as binary: \n•    The statute exempts a public undergraduate institution with a historic “policy of \nadmitting only students of one sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(5) (emphasis added).  \n•    Certain organizations  whose memberships have  “traditionally been limited to \npersons of one sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (emphasis added).  \n•    “Father-son or mother-daughter activities,” so long as similar opportunities provided \nfor “one sex” are offered to “the other sex.” (20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8) (emphasis \nadded). \n•     Scholarships  associated  with  participation  in  a  beauty  pageant  “limited  to \nindividuals of one sex only.” (20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(9) (emphasis added).  \n \nTitle  IX’s  explicit  exclusions  for  sex-specific  organizations  further  underscore  this \nunderstanding. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (authorizing certain groups to remain \nlimited to one sex, including fraternities and sororities).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 7 of 66   PageID 83\nsex schools and certain religious schools are also exempt and may limit membership to one \nsex. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(3), (5)). \n23.  The  early  implementing  regulations  in  1975  recognized  that  differential \ntreatment was sometimes necessary to ensure equal opportunities based on biological \ndifferences.  These  regulations,  which  remain  in  effect  today  through  the  current \nregulations,3 acknowledged that Title IX did not prohibit all differential treatment based on \nsex but aimed to provide equal opportunities for both sexes despite biological differences. \nTitle IX and its regulations reflect Congress’s policy decision to promote equal educational \nopportunities for both sexes while not disregarding biological differences or mandating \nidentical treatment of males and females in all circumstances—a decision that has proven \nhighly successful. For instance, female college attendance and participation in athletics \nhave soared since Title IX’s enactment. See Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th \n791, 818–19 (11th Cir. 2022) (Lagoa, J., concurring)). \n24.  For decades, the Department operated under the basic premise that “sex” \nmeans the biological male-female binary.  In its 1997 guidance clarifying that Title IX covers \nsame-sex sexual harassment, the Department affirmed that “both male and female students \nare protected from sexual harassment … even if the harasser and the person being harassed \nare members of the same sex.” Office for Civil Rights, Sexual Harassment Guidance: \nHarassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. \n12,034, 12,039 (Mar. 13, 1997). The same guidance stated that “Title IX does not prohibit \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation,”  id.  at  12,036,  because—as  the \nDepartment correctly recognized— “sex” refers to the status of being male or female, not \nto one’s heterosexual or homosexual orientation, or “gender identity.” \n \n3 See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)-(c) (allowing single-sex teams and requiring \nrecipients to provide “equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 8 of 66   PageID 84\nB.  The Obama Administration tries to redefine “sex” to include gender identity. \n25. Following the presidential transition in January 2009, activists launched an \naggressive campaign lobbying Congress and the White House to recognize gender identity \nas a protected class under federal civil-rights laws. \n26. Those early lobbying efforts focused on democratically enacted laws. In October \n2009, for example, Congress passed hate-crime legislation that included “gender identity” \nand  “sexual  orientation”  as  independently  protected  characteristics  alongside  other \nprotected traits like race, religion, and national origin. 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2). \n27. After the Republican Party won a majority of the House in 2010, however, the \npressure campaign shifted to unilateral executive action. See, e.g., NCTE 2010 Annual \nReport  8,  Nat’l  Ctr.  for  Transgender  Equality,  https://transequality.org/ \nsites/default/files/docs/resources/NCTE_Annual_Report_2010.pdf (“While we do not \nanticipate significant federal legislative victories for 2011, we … are planning for key wins \nin several federal administrative policy areas. In particular, we wil[l] [a]dvocate with the \nfederal government to interpret existing civil rights laws such as … Title IX … to cover \ntransgender people.”). \n28. In 2013, Congress considered a bill to extend Title IX’s sex-based provisions to \ngender identity. According to the “findings” section of that proposed law, congressional \naction  was  necessary  because  “federal  statutory  protections  expressly  address \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, and national origin” but \n“do not expressly include ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity.’” To end discrimination \nbased on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools, and for \nother purposes, H.R. 1652, 113th Cong. (2013). The bill failed. \n29. Tellingly, the same year that it rejected the bill to expand Title IX, Congress \nreauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, and, in the process, amended the law to \nprohibit recipients of federal grants from discriminating “on the basis” of “sex” or \n“gender identity” or “sexual orientation.” See 34 U.S.C. § 12291(b)(13)(A). Right after \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 9 of 66   PageID 85\nlisting “sex,” “gender identity,” and “sexual orientation” as distinct concepts, the law \nemphasizes that “nothing in this paragraph shall prevent any … program or activity from \nconsideration of an individual’s sex” if “sex segregation or sex-specific programming is \nnecessary to the essential operation of [the] program.” Id. § 12291(b)(13)(B) (emphasis \nadded). And today, section 12291 also prohibits “female genital mutilation or cutting,” \nwhich  it  defines  in  explicitly  biological  terms.  See  id.  §  12291(a)(15)  (incorporation \ndefinition of female genital mutilation in 18 U.S.C. § 116). \n30. During the Obama Administration, the Department issued its misguided 2011 \nDear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence. See \nRusslynn Ali, U.S. Dept. of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter: Sexual Violence (Apr. 4, 2011), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf; Catherine E. \nLhamon, U.S. Dept. of Educ., Questions & Answers on Title IX & Sexual Violence (Apr. 29, \n2014), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf.  \n31. These guidance documents asserted—for the first time—that “Title IX’s sex \ndiscrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination” based solely on “gender \nidentity.” Questions & Answers on Title IX & Sexual Violence, at 5 (2014). \n32. The Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers had a detrimental \nimpact on publicly funded education nationwide, including in Texas. Not only did the two \nguidance  documents  introduce  significant  confusion  over  academic  institutions’ \nobligations under Title IX, but they also created incentives for academic institutions to \nviolate students’ constitutional rights in order to avoid incurring liability. To offer some \ncontext, before 2011, the number of lawsuits filed against universities for failing to provide \ndue process in Title IX cases averaged one per year—by 2019, over 100 such lawsuits were \nfiled in that year alone. See Taylor Mooney, How Betsy DeVos plans to change the rules for \nhandling sexual misconduct on campus, CBS NEWS (Nov. 24, 2019), https://www.cbsnews. \ncom/news/title-ix-sexual-misconduct-on-campus-trump-administration-changing-obama \n-rules-cbsn-documentary/.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 10 of 66   PageID 86\n33. Although neither underwent notice and comment rulemaking, the two guidance \ndocuments put recipients in a no-win situation where either conforming or failing to \nconform to the guidance documents could expose them to significant risk of litigation.  \n34. In  2015,  Congress  considered  a  new  bill  that  proposed  to  do  what  the \nDepartment claimed to have already accomplished through its 2014 letter: extend Title \nIX’s protections to differential treatment based on gender identity. See S.439, 114th Cong. \n(2015). The bill was nearly identical to the one that Congress rejected in 2013. Once again, \nCongress did not pass the legislation. \n35. Twice in the past decade, Congress has considered legislation to amend Title \nIX to apply to gender identity. See, e.g., H.R. 1652, 113th Cong. (2013); S. 439, 114th Cong. \n(2015). Yet “Congress has not amended the law to state as much”; so “it is questionable,” \nto put it mildly, “whether the Secretary can alter the term ‘sex’ by administrative fiat.” \nNeese, 2022 WL 1265925, at *13. \n36. As the failed attempts to amend Title IX piled up, so did the pressure from \noutside  groups  demanding  that  the  government  change  Title  IX  through  unilateral \nexecutive action. \n37. In May 2016, the Department of Education issued another Dear Colleague \nLetter,  this  time expanding  Title  IX  obligations  to  transgender  students  (the  “2016 \nGuidance”). The 2016 Guidance informed federally funded educational institutions that \nthe Department would “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes \nof Title IX and its implementing regulations.” Catherine E. Lhamon and Vanita Gupta, \nU.S. Dep’ts of Educ. & Justice, 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender \nStudents,  at  2  (May  13,  2016),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/ \nletters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf?utm_name=.  \n38.  The 2016 Guidance further informed schools that any attempt to restrict \nshower, bathroom, or locker-room use according to biological sex would be unlawful. \nSchools were also warned that failing to “use pronouns and names consistent with a \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 11 of 66   PageID 87\nstudent’s gender identity” would constitute unlawful harassment under Title IX. Id. at 2–\n3.  \n39.  The 2016 Guidance suggested that schools needed to compel faculty and staff \nto “use pronouns and names consistent with a transgender student’s gender identity” and \npermit access to previously sex-separated facilities, including restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshower facilities, based solely on a student’s proclaimed gender identity. Id. at 3–4.  \n40.  Thirteen states led by Texas sued the federal government, alleging that the \n2016 Guidance was unlawful under the APA. The Northern District of Texas agreed and \nissued a preliminary injunction, concluding that the Department’s purported interpretive \nguidance “failed to comply with” the APA by “contradicting the existing legislative and \nregulatory texts” and “was likely contrary to law.” Texas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d \n810, 815, 816 n.4, 836 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  \nC. The Trump Administration rescinds the Obama Administration guidance. \n41.  In a decisive shift from previous policies, the Trump Administration rescinded \nthe Obama-era gender identity guidance in February 2017, and the lawsuit was voluntarily \ndismissed. Pls.’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Texas, 2016 WL 7852331, No. 7:16-cv-\n00054-O (N.D. Tex. Mar. 3, 2017), ECF No. 128. This action marked a return to the pre-\n2014 interpretation of Title IX, where the prohibition on sex-based discrimination was \nunderstood to mean biological sex, not gender identity. This return to the longstanding \ninterpretation  was  formalized  through  a  Dear  Colleague  Letter  issued  by  the  U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights in \nFebruary 2017, explicitly withdrawing the previous administration’s expansive views on \ngender identity under Title IX. Sandra Battle & T.E. Wheeler, II, U.S. Dep’ts of Educ. & \nJustice,  Dear  Colleague  Letter  on  Gender  Identity  Guidance  (Feb.  22,  2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 12 of 66   PageID 88\n42. It soon became apparent, however, that the withdrawal could not repair the \ndamage caused by the two guidance documents on its own. See Candice Jackson, U.S. Dept. \nof  Educ.,  Dear  Colleague  Letter  (Sept.  22,  2017),  https://www2.ed.gov/about/ \noffices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf. As the Department later explained, \nneither action “require[ed] or result[ed] in wholesale changes to the set of expectations \nguiding recipients’ responses to sexual harassment.” Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex \nin Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving Fed. Fin. Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026, 30,029 \n(May 19, 2020) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt 106) (the “2020 Rule”). Hence, many, if not \nmost, recipients  “chose  not  to  change their Title IX policies and procedures” as a \nprecaution against stigma and liability. Id. \n43. The  Department,  therefore,  initiated  a  round  of  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking,  after  which  it  published  a  comprehensive  set  of  regulations  governing \nrecipients’ obligations to prevent sex discrimination in their programs and activities. See 85 \nFed. Reg. 30,026. The 2020 Rule took effect on August 14, 2020.  \n44. The 2020 Rule addressed at least three significant ambiguities in the earlier \nguidance:  \na.  First,  the  2020  Rule  clearly  demarcated,  for  the  first  time,  the  outer \nboundaries  of  recipients’  obligations  and  liability  under  Title  IX  with \nrespect to sexual harassment.  \nb.  Second, the 2020 Rule clarified the standard under which conduct or speech \ncould constitute sex-based harassment—namely, that it be “so severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal \naccess.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,574.  \nc.  Third, the 2020 Rule reaffirmed the primacy of the U.S. Constitution and \nadopted multiple safeguards to ensure that Title IX enforcement protected \nthe rights and interests of all parties to a disciplinary proceeding. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 13 of 66   PageID 89\n45. For  example,  the  2020  Rule  also  addressed  the  question  of  whether \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” encompassed sexual orientation and gender identity. \nAlthough the Department declined to define “sex” in the 2020 Rule because it was not \nnecessary to effectuate the rules and would have consequences that extended outside of the \nproposed  rulemaking,  the  Department  noted  that  “Title  IX  and  its  implementing \nregulations include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification,” and further \nobserved that “provisions in the Department’s current regulations, which the Department \ndid not propose to revise in this rulemaking, reflect this presupposition.” 85 Fed. Reg. at \n30,178.  \n46.  And the Department further amended its regulations to clarify the definition of \n“sexual harassment” for purposes of Title IX enforcement. See 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026. The \nDepartment adopted the Supreme Court’s definition of harassment in Davis v. Monroe \nCnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999), that is, “conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.” 85 Fed. \nReg. at 30,036.  \n47.  Finally, the 2020 Rule strengthened the rights of students accused of sexual \nharassment under Title IX. It required schools to, among other things, provide the accused \nwith written notice of the charges against him, 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,571, let a representative \naccompany him to disciplinary hearings, id. at 30,577, and let that counsel cross-examine \nwitnesses. Id. It specified that schools could choose between a preponderance or clear-and-\nconvincing standard to adjudicate accusations of Title IX misconduct, but only if they used \nthe same standard for “all formal complaints of sexual harassment,” including “formal \ncomplaints against employees.” Id. at 30,575.  \nD. The Supreme Court decides Bostock. \n48.  In June 2020, shortly after the Department issued the 2020 Rule, the Supreme \nCourt decided Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020). The Court held that \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 14 of 66   PageID 90\nTitle VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination prevents an employer from firing an employee \n”for being homosexual or transgender.” Id. at 651–52. The Court interpreted Title VII’s \nprohibition against discrimination “because of” sex using a “but-for” causation standard, \nconcluding  that  “sex  plays  an  unmistakable  and  impermissible  role  in  [a]  discharge \ndecision” based on an employee’s homosexuality or transgender status. Id. at 660.  \n49.  But Bostock explicitly assumed that “homosexuality and transgender status are \ndistinct concepts from sex,” id. at 669, and it assumed throughout its opinion that “sex” \nin Title VII referred “only to biological distinctions between male and female,” id. at 655 \n(emphasis added). The Court refrained from extending its decision to other statutes like \nTitle IX and declined to “prejudge” whether it would “sweep beyond Title VII” or impact \n“sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes.” Id. at 681.  \n50.  In January 2021, the Department’s Office of the General Counsel issued a \nmemo clarifying that Bostock did not affect the 2020 Rule. It reiterated that Title IX’s \n“longstanding construction of the term ‘sex’ to mean biological sex, male or female” aligns \nwith the ordinary public meaning of “sex” at the time of the statute’s enactment. Reed D. \nRubinstein, Memorandum for Kimberly M. Richey, Acting Assistant Sec’y of the Office for Civil \nRights,  re:  Bostock  v.  Clayton  Cty.,  140  S.  Ct.  1731  (2020)  (Jan.  8,  2021)  at  1, 10, \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/other/ogc-memorandum-\n01082021.pdf.  The  memo  also  emphasized  that  “schools  must  consider  students’ \nbiological sex when determining whether male and female student-athletes have equal \nopportunities to participate.” Id. at 7.  \nE.  The Biden Administration initiates efforts to redefine “sex” under Title IX. \n51.  Despite  the  well-reasoned  analysis  of  the  Department  itself  that  Bostock \nchanged nothing in the Title IX context and that “sex” means “biological sex,” the Biden \nAdministration, like the Obama Administration before it, once again moved to redefine \n“sex” as including gender identity.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 15 of 66   PageID 91\n52. From the start, President Biden opposed the 2020 Rule, stating on the campaign \ntrail that he would order the Department to put a “quick end” to it if elected. See Joe Biden, \nStatement on the Trump Administration Rule to Undermine Title IX & Campus Safety (May 6, \n2020),  https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-\ntrump-administration-rule-to-undermine-title-ix-and-e5dbc545daa.  \n53.  Shortly after taking office, President Biden issued an executive order declaring \nthat Bostock applied across all federal law, maintaining that under Bostock’s reasoning, laws \nprohibiting sex discrimination—including Title IX  of the Education  Amendments  of \n1972—should also prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, \n“so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.” Exec. Order No. \n13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021). Federal agencies were directed to review their \nregulations and develop plans to align them with the executive order. \n54.  Following this directive, on June 22, 2021, the Department issued guidance \ninterpreting Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” to encompass \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Enf’t of Title IX of the Educ. \nAmend. of 1972 with Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity \nin Light of Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“2021 \nGuidance”). The Department claimed that this interpretation aligned with Title IX’s \npurpose of “ensuring equal opportunity and protecting individuals from the harms of sex \ndiscrimination”  Id.  at  32,639.  This  was  followed  by  additional  guidance  from  the \nDepartment stating its intent to “fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity in education programs and activities that receive \nfederal financial assistance.” Suzanne B. Goldberg, Dear Educator letter on Confronting \nAnti-LGBTQI+  Harassment  in  Schools,  at  2  (June  23,  2021), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/stakeholders/educator-\n202106-tix.pdf. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 16 of 66   PageID 92\n55.  Like the 2016 Guidance, the enforcement of the 2021 Guidance was swiftly \nenjoined. In Tennessee v. United States Dep't of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807 (E.D. Tenn. \n2022), the Eastern District of Tennessee enjoined the Department from enforcing the 2021 \nguidance, ruling that it likely acted unlawfully by creating “new rights and obligations” \nwithout following the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements. Id. at 842.  \n56.  The court identified two main issues with the 2021 Guidance: (1) It was \ninconsistent with existing regulations. Title IX allows for sex-separation in some cases, but \nthe Department’s guidance “appear[ed] to suggest such conduct will be investigated as \nunlawful  discrimination,”  id.  at  839;  and  (2)  it  “create[d]  rights  for  students  and \nobligations for regulated entities not to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity  that  appear  nowhere  in  Bostock,  Title  IX,  or  its  implementing  regulations.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  \nF.  The Biden Administration publishes the Proposed Rule to replace the 2020 \nRule and overhaul Title IX. \n57.  Undeterred,  in  July  2022,  the  Department  issued  a  notice  of  proposed \nrulemaking,  reiterating  its  position  from  the  2021  guidance  and  introducing  other \nsignificant revisions to Title IX. Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Educ. Programs or \nActivities Receiving Fed. Fin. Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022) (the Proposed \nRule).  \n58. The Proposed Rule sought to formally rescind the 2020 Rule’s biology-based \ndefinition of sex—based almost entirely on the supposed applicability of Bostock. 87 Fed. \nReg. at 41,410, 41,531. It also dropped the 2020 Rule’s adoption of the Davis standard for \nactionable sexual harassment, id. at 41,568–69, and removed procedural protections for \nstudents accused of misconduct, id. at 41,485, 41,488, 41,497, 41,577–78. \n59. The  Department  received  over  240,000  comments  on  the  Proposed \nRule— overwhelmingly negative. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,477. Texas, through its Attorney \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 17 of 66   PageID 93\nGeneral and Governor, submitted multiple comments before the 60-day comment period \nfor the Proposed Rule closed on September 12, 2022.  \n60.  In its comments, Texas highlighted the burden the Proposed Rule would \nimpose on the State, as well as the risk the regulations posed to constitutional rights. The \ncomments explained that the combination of expanding recipients’ obligation to respond \nto sex discrimination, while also lowering the threshold of what fell within that description, \nmeant,  in  practice,  that  recipients  would  hyper-police  interactions  among  students, \nparents, and faculty for fear of being found noncompliant if individuals affiliated with the \nrecipient failed to recognize each person’s highly individualized, potentially fluid, and \nunverifiable gender identity. \n61. The Proposed Rule also weakened procedural protections for students accused \nof sexual harassment, such as the right to present witnesses, inspect all evidence, and have \na live hearing. Id. at 41,485, 41,497, 41,577. It also abandoned the Davis standard for \nactionable sexual harassment, instead adopting a broader, less stringent definition. Id. at \n41,568–69. \n62.  The  comments  added  that  much  of  Proposed  Rule  departed  from  the \nDepartment’s  past  policies,  yet  the  changes  were  neither  adequately  explained  nor \ngrounded in the text, structure, or purpose of Title IX. As an example, the Department \nhinged its redefinition of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity almost \nentirely on the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock. Yet as Texas pointed out in its \ncomments, Bostock involved an unrelated statute that was enacted nearly a decade earlier, \npursuant to a different constitutional power, and did not address questions involving “sex \nsegregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes”—all of which appeared in the \nProposed Rule. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 18 of 66   PageID 94\nG. The Final Rule is published in substantially the same form as the Proposed \nRule. \n63.  Despite these deficiencies, the Biden Administration pressed on. On April 29, \n2024,  the  Department  published  its  Final  Rule,  dramatically  reshaping  Title  IX  by \nredefining what constitutes sex discrimination and broadening the definition of prohibited \n“harassment.” Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving \nFed. Fin. Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt \n106). \n64. Despite  strong  opposition  and  over  240,000  public  comments—mostly \nnegative—the Department published the Final Rule largely unchanged from the Proposed \nRule. Set to take effect on August 1, 2024, it expands schools’ liability risks and Title IX \nobligations by expanding the definition of sex discrimination and harassment beyond what \nTitle IX’s text and purpose originally intended. \n65.  The Final Rule redefines Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to include \n“discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,476. It asserts that \nit preempts all state and local laws conflicting with its terms and applies to any school \n“program or activity,” regardless of whether the activity occurs within the school or even \nwithin the United States. Id. at 33,885–86. \n66.  While the Final Rule allows schools to maintain sex-segregated programs, \nactivities, and facilities, it prohibits schools from enforcing these distinctions in a way that \ncauses “more than de minimis harm”—but the Final Rule simultaneously contends that \nprohibiting a person from participating in education programs or activities consistent with \ntheir  gender  identity  inherently  inflicts  more  than  de  minimis  harm.  Id.  at  33,816, \n33,819– 20. Thus, the Final Rule threatens to withhold federal funding from schools that \ndeny students access to bathrooms and locker rooms based on their claimed gender identity \nor maintain dress codes based on biological sex. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 19 of 66   PageID 95\n67. The Final Rule claims that it does not affect athletics programs in schools \nbecause there is currently a regulation that allows sex-separated sports teams. 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,817–18, 33,839. Yet that was also true for bathrooms and locker rooms, but the Final \nRule  declares  that  invalid  when  exceptions  are  not  made  for  those  who  identify  as \ntransgender. See id. at 33,819–21. The Final Rule claims sex-separate athletics does not \nsuffer the same fate because of the Javits Amendment, 88 Stat. 484, 612 (1974), and because \nCongress reviewed the regulation that explicitly allows them before it went into effect. See \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816–17. But the Javits Amendment only applies to “intercollegiate \nathletic activities,” 88 Stat. at 612, and the bathroom regulation was part of the same set of \nregulations as the one relating to sports and also not disapproved by Congress. See 40 Fed. \nReg. 24,128, 24,141 (June 4, 1975); 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. And the Department fails to address \nits own position taken in litigation that Title IX forbids categorically limiting sports teams \nto one biological sex. See B.P.J. v. W. Virginia, ECF 42, No. 2:21-cv-316 (S.D. W. Va. Jun. \n17, 2021); United States Amicus Br. 24–27, B.P.J. v. W.V. State Bd. of Educ., Nos. 23-1078, \n23-1130 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2023).  \n68.  The Final Rule also prohibits schools from even seeking confirmation of a \nstudent’s gender identity, deeming such inquiries as causing “more than de minimis \nharm.” Id. at 33,819. So schools cannot require documentary evidence confirming a \nstudent’s  gender  dysphoria  diagnoses  prior  to  permitting  their  participation  in  sex-\nsegregated activities or facilities of the opposite sex. \n69.  The Final Rule also broadens the definition of harassment by lowering the \nstandard set by the 2020 Rule, and instead defining sex-based harassment as “subjectively \nand objectively offensive” and “sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny a student’s \nability to participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or activity.” Id. at \n33,516. This new standard does not require harassment to be both severe and pervasive, \nmeaning a single serious incident or a pattern of non-severe incidents might qualify. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 20 of 66   PageID 96\n70.  The Final Rule also expands the definition of harassment to cover conduct that \nis “subjectively and objectively” offensive from the complainant’s position. For instance, \nreferring to a transgender-identifying male using male pronouns instead of female pronouns \ncould be considered harassment based on the individual’s subjective viewpoint. \nIV.  The Legal Flaws of the Final Rule  \n71. The Final Rule is flawed from top to bottom—no aspect of it can be salvaged. \nA. Redefining “On the Basis of Sex” \n72. Title IX states, “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance.”  20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n73. For the entire half century since its enactment, both the Department and \nrecipients have understood Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to refer to a \nperson’s biological sex. Notwithstanding this history, the Final Rule redefines Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, \nsex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender \nidentity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. \n74. The Final Rule threatens to withhold federal funding from schools that do not \nallow students access to “restrooms and locker rooms” and comply with any “appearance \ncodes (including dress and grooming codes)” based on gender identity. See, e.g., 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,816. The Final Rule dictates that a school violates Title IX’s nondiscrimination \nmandate if a transgender student is denied access to a bathroom or locker room of the \nopposite biological sex. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818.  \n75. “The Department cannot enforce Title IX in a manner that requires recipients \nto restrict any rights protected under the First Amendment.” 2020 Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n30,071. But under the Final Rule, recipients have an obligation under the Final Rule to \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 21 of 66   PageID 97\n“take  specific  actions … to  promptly  and  effectively  prevent  sex  discrimination,” \nincluding what the Final Rule defines as sex-based harassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. It \nfollows that recipients would have an obligation under the Final Rule to confront students \nand employees who refuse to affirm someone’s gender identity, up to and including \ndisciplinary proceedings, or risk being found in noncompliance with Title IX. \n76. The Final Rule also institutes a new, lower standard for sexual harassment. The \nFinal Rule stipulates that “[s]ex-based harassment, including harassment predicated on sex \nstereotyping or gender identity, is covered by Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, \nsubjectively and objectively offensive, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny \na student’s ability to participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516 (emphasis added).  \n77. In adopting this standard, the Final Rule expands Title IX’s prohibition on sex-\nbased  harassment  beyond  that  which  would  create  liability  under  Supreme  Court \nprecedent.. Compare, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498, with Davis, 526 U.S. at 649–50.  \n78. Under Davis, the Supreme Court held that Title IX imposes liability on schools \nwhen sexual harassment is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively \nbars  the  victim’s  access  to  an  educational  opportunity  or  benefit.”  526  U.S.  at 633 \n(emphasis added). The Final Rule ignores this precedent and institutes a sweeping new \nstandard that drastically lowers the “effectively bars” access to an educational opportunity \nor benefits to now include any conduct that “limits” access—in any way and to any \ndegree—to educational opportunities or benefits. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,497–98. Such a \nstandard subjects students, faculty, and staff to onerous investigations that would have \nwould not rise to the level of actionable conduct under the Davis standard, such as failing \nto use a student’s preferred pronouns.  \n79. The 2020 Rule purposefully adopted the Davis standard “to ensure that speech \nand  expression  are  prohibited  only  when  their  seriousness  and  impact  avoid  First \nAmendment concerns.” 85. Fed. Reg. at 30,142. The Final Rule departs from this policy \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 22 of 66   PageID 98\nbut fails to adequately justify the Department’s about-face; nor does it explain how the \nlooser standard conforms to the Constitution—the reason given by the Department is \nsimply that the Defendants “believe[] a broader standard is appropriate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,498. \n80. The  Final  Rule  also  lacks  objective  standards,  making  every  complaint \nsubjective,  not  limited  to  those  who  visibly  identify  as  transgender  but  broadly \nencompassing anyone who may even only temporarily or intermittently so identify, see Am. \nPsychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) \n(defining “transgender” to include “individuals who transiently” identify one way), or \nthose with nefarious intentions who are merely seeking access to a schoolgirls’ bathroom \nor locker room for predatory purposes. See Jessica Marie Baumgartner, Transwoman Facing \nCharges for Flashing Women at California Spa Is a Registered Sex Offender, Evie Mag. (Sep. \n3,  2021),  https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/transwoman-flashing-women-california-\nspa-registered-sex-offender. \n81. The Final Rule is therefore ambiguous, overbroad, and vague, and fails to \nadequately notify schools of adequate compliance to avoid onerous investigations.  \nB.  The Final Rule wrongly relies on Bostock. \n82. The Department lacks the legal justification to initiate and support such radical \ndepartures in the interpretation of Title IX. The Department rests its redefinition of sex \ndiscrimination almost entirely on the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in Bostock. But that \ncase’s “reasoning applies only to Title VII, as Bostock itself and [] subsequent cases make \nclear.” L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, C.J.).  \n83. How  does  Title  IX  differ  from  Title  VII?  To  start,  Title  VII  prohibits \nemployment  discrimination  “because  of  such  individual’s … sex[],”42  U.S.C. \n§ 2000e- 2(a), but Title IX prohibits education discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a). The statutes thus contain different language with different results for \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 23 of 66   PageID 99\ndifferent contexts. Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668, 675–84 (N.D. Tex. 2022) \n(Kacsmaryk, J.) (Bostock and its reasoning do not apply to Title IX). And “Bostock … was \nlimited only to Title VII itself” and “d[id] not stretch to [other statutes].” Pelcha v. MW \nBancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); see also Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., \n57 F.4th 791, 808 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (holding that Bostock’s reasoning applies only \nto Title VII, and describing the argument that it applies to Title IX as “faulty”). \n84. Defendants conflate Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of \nsex,”  20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a),  with  Title  VII’s  prohibition  on  discrimination  “because \nof … sex,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). But the Bostock court ruled that the phrase “because \nof” in Title VII mandated a sweeping but-for causation requirement. Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. The U.S. Supreme Court has tendered no such ruling regarding the phrase “on the \nbasis of sex” as used in Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). To the contrary. “On the basis of \nsex” references to one’s “biological sex”—it does not mean does not mean “on the basis \nof gender identity” or “on the basis of sexual orientation.”  \n85. Indeed, even though Title IX provides that recipients of federal funding for \neducation programs or activities shall not discriminate “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a), Title IX explicitly authorizes separation based on sex in certain situations, \nincluding “maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, \nand specified single-sex educational institutions, organizations, activities, and scholarship \nawards, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). These exceptions presume—and only make sense in the \ncontext of—biological sex is the relevant category.  \n86. In any event, the Final Rule misinterprets the holding of Bostock and the \ndefinition of “sex” discrimination adopted by the Bostock majority. Bostock does not hold \nthat  discrimination  on  account  of  “sexual  orientation”  or  “gender  identity”  is \ndiscrimination on account of “sex”; rather, it holds only that Title VII’s prohibition on \n“sex” discrimination prohibits employers from firing or refusing to hire individuals “for \nbeing homosexual or transgender.”  \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 24 of 66   PageID 100\n87. Bostock explains that an employer who fires an employee for conduct or personal \nattributes that it would tolerate in a person of the opposite biological sex has made the \nemployee’s sex the “but-for cause” of his discharge, and that (in the Court’s view) \nautomatically violates the statutory command of Title VII. The Court explained: \nIf the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he \nis attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or \nactions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer \nintentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee’s \nsex, and the affected employee’s sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or \ntake an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an \notherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the \nemployer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for \ntraits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. \nAgain,  the  individual  employee’s  sex  plays  an  unmistakable  and \nimpermissible role in the discharge decision. \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 660. \n88. Bostock also makes clear that an employer does not violate Title VII or engage in \n“sex” discrimination if it fires an employee for conduct or personal attributes that it would \nnot tolerate in an employee of the opposite biological sex: \nTake  an  employer  who  fires  a  female  employee  for  tardiness  or \nincompetence or simply supporting the wrong sports team. Assuming the \nemployer would not have tolerated the same trait in a man, Title VII stands \nsilent. \nId. \n89. Bostock does not prohibit employers (or anyone else) from discriminating on \naccount of sexual orientation or gender identity, so long as they do not engage in “sex” \ndiscrimination when doing so. For example, Bostock does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst bisexual students or individuals, so long as the employer regards bisexual behavior \nor orientation as equally unacceptable in a man or a woman. See, e.g., Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n660; see also id. at 658 (“[F]iring [a] person for actions or attributes it would tolerate in an \nindividual of another sex … discriminates against that person in violation of Title VII.”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 25 of 66   PageID 101\n90.  Discrimination  against  bisexuals  is  certainly  discrimination  on  account  of \n“sexual orientation,” but it is not discrimination on account of “sex.”  \n91. Bostock allows discrimination against homosexual or transgender individuals, so \nlong as it is done pursuant to rules or policies that apply equally to both sexes and would \nlead to the same result if the individual’s biological different were different. \n92.  A teacher or professor, for example, may refuse to accommodate a transgender \nor nonbinary student’s demands to be referred to by the singular pronoun “they”—so long \nas the teacher or professor refuses demands for such pronoun usage on equal terms from a \nbiological male or a biological woman, and would equally refuse to honor the transgender \nor nonbinary student’s request if that student’s biological sex were different.  \n93. Even  if  the  Department considers policies  or practices of that sort to be \nregarded as discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, they do not \nconstitute “sex” discrimination as defined in Bostock because the policies apply equally to \nboth biological sexes. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 669 (“We agree that homosexuality and \ntransgender status are distinct concepts from sex.”). \n94. The Final Rule wrongly equates discrimination on account of sexual orientation \nand gender identity with “sex” discrimination. Yet there are many ways in which entities \ncovered by Title IX could discriminate against homosexual, bisexual, transgender, or non-\nbinary individuals without engaging in the kind of “sex”–based discrimination described in \nBostock. \n95. The Final Rule further conflicts with the reasoning of Bostock because that case \ndid not find that all sex-based distinctions were prohibited. Bostock repeatedly cited the \nCourt’s earlier decision in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), as \nauthority.  Oncale  explained  that  Title  VII  “does  not  reach  genuine  but  innocuous \ndifferences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex \nand  of  the  opposite  sex,”  and  “requires  neither  asexuality  nor  androgyny  in  the \nworkplace.” Id. at 75, 81. \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 26 of 66   PageID 102\n96. The Oncale Court noted the central concern of Title VII was not every aspect of \ninteraction  in  the  workplace  but  “whether  members  of  one  sex  are  exposed  to \ndisadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are \nnot exposed.” Id. at 80 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) \n(Ginsburg, J., concurring)).  \n97. The Second Circuit—in one of the cases consolidated with and affirmed in \nBostock—also favorably cites Oncale as “arguably” supporting the view that “sex-specific \nbathroom and grooming policies [do not] impose disadvantageous terms or conditions” \nbecause not all distinctions of “‘sexual content or connotations’  rise  to  the  level  of \ndiscrimination.” Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 119 & n.16 (2d Cir. 2018) (en \nbanc) (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79–80)); see also West v. Radtke, 48 F.4th 836, 849 (7th \nCir. 2022) (finding Title VII would not be violated by preventing transgender prison guard \nfrom performing strip searches of opposite-sex inmates). \n98. Relatedly, Bostock also cautioned that “Title VII does not concern itself with \neverything that happens ‘because of’ sex,” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 657—only discrimination \nthat is “inextricably” related to sex is forbidden; distinctions “related to sex in some vague \nsense” or having only “some disparate impact on one sex or the other” are not reached by \nthe statute. Id. at 660–61. \n99. Bostock did not overturn any Supreme Court precedents, instead resting on \nthose dating to the 1970s. It also did not disturb lower-court precedent that has long applied \nthose same precedents. “[T]the Court relied in Bostock on the same well established Title \nVII principles that animated the outcome in those prior decisions [of lower courts that \napplied  the  same  key  precedents,  so  those  courts]  effectively  anticipated  Bostock’s \nrationale.” Maner v. Dignity Health, 9 F.4th 1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2021) (Bea, J.) (explaining \nBostock  did  not  overturn  decades  of  lower-court  precedents  rejecting  “paramour \npreference” theory of liability). \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 27 of 66   PageID 103\n100.  This is consistent with Willingham v. Macon Tel. Publ’g Co., 507 F.2d 1084 \n(5th Cir. 1975) (en banc), which upheld sex-specific grooming codes under Title VII. \nWillingham applied Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) one of the key \ncases the Supreme Court relied on in Bostock. The Second Circuit in Zarda— which relied \non the same key precedents that the Supreme Court would later adopt in Bostock (Martin \nMarietta and L.A. Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978))—favorably cited \nWillingham as consistent with its analysis. Zarda, 883 F.3d at 118–19. \n101.  In  short,  Bostock  did  not  nullify  the  Supreme  Court’s  longstanding \nacceptance of differences between the sexes. It did not question any longstanding precedent \nbeyond the narrow question before it: whether “[a]n employer who fires an individual \nmerely for being gay or transgender defies the law.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 683 (emphasis \nadded). \nC. The Final Rule’s expansion of Title IX’s scope into sexual orientation and \ngender identity violates the Clear Statement Rule and the Major Questions \nDoctrine. \n102.  Even if there were ambiguity on whether Title IX adopts the Final Rule’s \ndefinition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” that ambiguity must be resolved in favor \nof the State because conditions on federal funding must be stated clearly. Adams, 57 F.4th \nat 815.  \n103.  Congress enacted Title IX pursuant to its powers under the Spending \nClause. Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 (“[W]e have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislation \nenacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause[.]”). If Congress \nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal funding under Title IX, it must do so \nwith “a clear voice,” “unambiguously.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \n104.  This clear statement rule is required when imposing a condition on federal \nfunding because “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 28 of 66   PageID 104\nof a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \nconditions.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 815 (citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). “Recipients cannot \nknowingly  accept  the  deal  with  the  Federal  Government  unless  they  would  clearly \nunderstand the obligations that would come along with doing so.” Cummings v. Premier \nRehab Keller, PLLC, 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) (internal quotations omitted).  \n105.  The use of the word “sex” in Title IX did not put educational institutions \nand  programs  on  notice  that  by  accepting  funding  from  the  federal  government  for \neducational services and activities, they are prohibited from providing bathrooms or other \nfacilities for the two sexes. See Adams, 57 F.4th at 816. That is clear not only from historical \npractice but from Defendants’ longstanding interpretation of Title IX and its implementing \nregulations, which “include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification.” 85 \nFed. Reg. at 30,178. \n106.  Similarly, courts will not assume that Congress has assigned questions of \n“deep economic and political significance” to an agency unless Congress has done so \nexpressly. See King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015); FDA v. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000).  \n107.   “We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to \nexercise powers of vast economic and political significance.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t \nof Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Grp. \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)).  \n108.  “Congress typically [does not] use oblique or elliptical language to empower \nan agency to make a radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme …We presume \nthat Congress intends to make major policy decisions itself, not leave those decisions to \nagencies.” Id. (cleaned up); see also Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 160.  \n109.  The  Final  Rule  will  affect  all  elementary  schools,  secondary  schools, \npostsecondary institutions, and other recipients of federal financial funds with far-reaching \nsocial and economic impact. Yet Title IX’s language cannot be plausibly read to smuggle in \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 29 of 66   PageID 105\na power for federal agencies to overturn the “unremarkable—and nearly universal—\npractice[s]” such as separating bathrooms by biological sex, common in States’ governance \nof schools. Adams, 57 F.4th at 796. \nD. In the alternative, if Bostock applies to Title IX, the Final Rule violates it. \n110.  In addition, even if Title IX covered discrimination on the bases of sexual \norientation and gender identity, the Final Rule interprets Title IX’s anti-discrimination \nprovision as requiring accommodations for gender identity even though Title IX—unlike \nTitle  VII’s  prohibition  on  religious  discrimination  and  the  disability  discrimination \nprovisions of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act—has no \naccommodation requirement.  \n111. The Final Rule requires exceptions from admittedly lawful sex-segregated \npolicies and facilities for those whose gender identity is transgender—and only for them, \nas schools would still be allowed to prevent biological males who do not identify as women \nfrom entering female-only spaces and programs. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818 (under Final \nRule, “sex separation in certain circumstances, including in the context of bathrooms or \nlocker rooms, is not presumptively unlawful sex discrimination” but when a school “denies \na transgender student access to a sex-separate facility or activity consistent with that \nstudent’s  gender  identity,  this  would  violate  Title  IX’s  general  nondiscrimination \nmandate”); id. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31: where Title IX permits \n“different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex,” the \nFinal Rule requires “sex” to be determined by gender identity); id. at 33,820 (reasoning \nthat non-transgender students are not harmed by being denied access to sex-separated \nfacilities such as restrooms and locker rooms, so only transgender students are protected \nby the new 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) that prohibits “more than de minimis harm”). \n112.  The types of school policies targeted by the Final Rule do not discriminate \nbased on gender identity. While Bostock held that “discrimination based on homosexuality \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 30 of 66   PageID 106\nor transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex,” 590 U.S. at 669, the \nFinal Rule instead addresses “the converse question: whether discrimination on the basis \nof sex necessarily entails discrimination based on transgender status.” Adams v. Sch. Bd. of \nSt. Johns Cty., 3 F.4th 1299, 1332 (11th Cir. 2021) (Pryor, C.J., dissenting), rev’d by Adams., \n57 F.4th 791. \n113.  The  Final  Rule  never  addressed  the  question  of  whether  the  policies \n“impose[d] disadvantageous terms or conditions” based on sex. The Second Circuit ruling \naffirmed in Bostock left this question open but indicated the serious possibility that such \npolicies were not covered by Title VII even if discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity were forbidden. Zarda, 883 F.3d at 118–19 (favorably citing on this \nground Oncale, 523 U.S. 75, and Willingham, 507 F.2d 1084). This distinction is alluded to \nin Bostock itself. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681 (after noting that its reasoning does not settle \nthe issue of “bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind,” referring to Title \nVII’s  limitation  to  “distinctions  or  differences  in  treatment  that  injure  protected \nindividuals”; while “firing employees surely counts other policies and practices might or \nmight not qualify as unlawful discrimination”) (cleaned up). But if such policies are \ncovered by Title IX, then the Final Rule violated the prohibition on treating employees and \nstudents differently based on gender identity. \n114.  Consider standard bathroom norms. All biological males, regardless of their \ngender identity, may use the men’s bathroom; all biological females, regardless of their \ngender identity, may use the women’s bathroom. “Separating bathrooms based on sex \ndates back as far as written history will take us,” long before the concept of gender identity \neven existed. Adams, 3 F.4th at 1328 (Pryor, C.J., dissenting) (cleaned up), rev’d, 57 F.4th \n791.  These policies do not even consider “gender identity,” and therefore cannot be \ndescribed as discriminating based on that category. Cf. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (“[I]f no part of the hiring decision turned on [the applicant’s] status as \ndisabled, he cannot, ipso facto, have been subject to disparate treatment”). “Separating \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 31 of 66   PageID 107\nbathrooms by sex treats people differently on the basis of sex … [but] the mere act of \ndetermining an individual’s sex, using the same rubric for both sexes, does not treat anyone \ndifferently on the basis of sex.” Adams, 3 F.4th at 1325–26 (Pryor, C.J., dissenting), rev’d, \n57 F.4th 791. \n115.  The Final Rule purports to allow sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers (explicitly) and sex-specific dress codes and pronoun usage policies (implicitly) \nas a general matter. But it then “tr[ied] to work around [those concessions] with a linguistic \ndevice.” Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 723 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Williams, J., concurring in \nthe result) (criticizing plaintiffs’ concession that military may have sex-specific standards \nwhile arguing that “sex” should be determined by subjective gender identity). It is no \nconsolation to tell schools they can still have sex-specific bathrooms (or dress codes or \npronoun usage) so long as they allow exceptions for individuals who subjectively identify \nas the opposite sex. \n116.  If schools may have separate facilities or policies for men and women, as the \nFinal Rule concedes, then they may also require compliance with those policies. Cf. \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts § 30, at \n192–93 (2012) (“[W]henever a power is given by a statute, everything necessary to making \nit effectual or requisite to attaining the end is implied.”) (citation omitted). The same is true \nfor sex-specific dress codes or allowing the use of gendered pronouns as part of standard \nEnglish in schools; such policies do not classify based on the gender identity of anyone but \ndisregard that concept altogether, exactly as Bostock requires. Indeed, to allow schools to \nhave sex-specific policies, but then require them to have exemptions only for transgender \nemployees or students, violates Bostock because such a rule discriminates based on gender \nidentity. \nV.  The Final Rule’s Irreparable Harm to Texas \nTexas is harmed by the Final Rule in several ways. \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 32 of 66   PageID 108\nA. Texas is the object of the Final Rule and faces compliance costs.  \n117.  Texas administers numerous education programs and operates thousands \nof educational institutions through its constituent agencies and political subdivisions, \nincluding programs and institutions that receive federal funding and are subject to Title IX \nand its effectuating regulations.  \n118.  The Texas Constitution charges the Texas Legislature “to establish and \nmake suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public \nfree schools.” Tex. Const. art. VII, § 1.  \n119.  Pursuant to this charge, Texas funds, regulates, and oversees the Nation’s \nsecond-largest K–12 public education system, serving over 5.4 million students across \n1,200 school districts. Tex. Educ. Agency, Enrollment in Texas Public Schools 2021-22 at ix \n(June 2022), https://tea.texas.gov/reports-and-data/school-performance/accountability-\nresearch/enroll-2021-22.pdf.  \n120.  The Texas Education Agency (“TEA”) is a state agency charged by State \nlaw to oversee the State’s public school system’s compliance with Title IX. See Tex. Educ. \nCode § 7.021. As part of its mandate, TEA allocates the majority of federal funding for \nTexas K-12 education. See Ex. A, Decl. Michael Meyer ¶ 6. \n121.  In the 2021–2022 biennium, Texas received approximately $6.6 billion \ndollars in federal funds for its K-12 education. Tex. Educ. Agency, 2022 Comprehensive \nBiennial Report on Texas Public Schools at 239 (Dec. 2020), https://tea.texas.gov/reports-\nand-data/school-performance/accountability-research/comp-annual-biennial-2022.pdf.  \n122.  In fiscal year 2023, Texas public schools received approximately $9.4 billion \nin  federal  funding  distributed  by  TEA  and  an  additional  $4.8  billion  in  federal \ndisbursements  that  were  allocated  by  the  federal  government  directly  or  another \nintermediary. See Ex. A ¶¶ 4–5.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 33 of 66   PageID 109\n123.  State statute requires TEA to operate a number of educational programs \ndirectly. These include “regional day programs” for deaf students and a school network \nfor students with “visual impairments.” Tex. Educ. Code 7.021(b)(10), (11). \n124.  The Texas School for the Deaf is a state agency that provides educational \nservices, on a day and residential basis, to students who are deaf or hard of hearing. Tex. \nEduc. Code § 30.051; Ex. B, Decl. of Peter L. Bailey ¶ 3.  The school’s dormitories, athletic \nteams, and locker rooms are separated by biological sex. Id. at ¶¶ 3–4.  \n125.  The Texas School for the Deaf relies on federal funding for the services it \nprovides to students and their families. Id. at ¶ 5. The school received $1,261,735.00 in \nfederal funds for fiscal year 2024. Id.  \n126.  Texas also funds, supports, and administers a robust higher education \nnetwork. Texas is home to 119 public postsecondary institutions, including 37 universities \nand 82 two-year colleges and technical schools. See Tex. Higher Educ. Coordinating Bd., \n2020  Texas  Public  Higher  Education  Almanac  at  28,  47  (Sept.  28,  2020), \nhttps://reportcenter.highered.texas.gov/agency-publication/almanac/2020-texas-public-\nhigher-education-almanac/.  \n127.  While most States have just one or two public university systems, Texas has \nsix. The largest of these systems—the University of Texas—has 14 separate locations that \neducate approximately 256,000 students each year. See About The University of Texas \nSystem, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM, https://www.utsystem.edu/about. All told, \nthe State’s entire higher education network includes 148 public institutions and currently \nenrolls approximately 1.4 million students. See Ex. C, Decl. of Sarah Keyton ¶ 3.  \n128.  Public  postsecondary  education  institutions  in  Texas  received \napproximately $2.5 billion in federal funding during fiscal year 2022. \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 34 of 66   PageID 110\n129.  As a condition of receiving federal funding, Title IX protections against sex-\nbased discrimination apply to state educational institutions. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Hence, \nshould  Texas,  or  any  of  Texas’s  affiliated  academic  institutions,  deviate  from  the \nDepartment’s guidance effectuating Title IX, that departure would invite enforcement \nactions at the risk of significant monetary penalties, up to and including the loss of federal \nmoney.  \n130.  Public education in Texas depends on federal funds. Institutions that lose \ntheir federal funding will need to eliminate certain educational services if they cannot find \nalternative funding sources. See Exs. A ¶ 8, B ¶¶ 6–7, C ¶ 7. \n131.  Texas educational institutions rely on federal funding and will be irreparably \nharmed if they lose their funding because of their reliance on 50 years of Title IX practice \nand legal precedent interpreting “on the basis of sex” to mean biological sex, not “sexual \norientation” and “gender identity.” Id. \n132.  It  is  a  “fundamental  canon  of  statutory  construction”  that,  “unless \notherwise defined,  words  will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, \ncommon meaning” at the time of enactment. Sandifer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 \n(2014) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)); Scalia & Garner, supra, at \n16 (same).  \n133.  No dictionary at the time Title IX was enacted defined “sex” to include \n“gender identity” or “sexual orientation.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 812–13. \n134.  Texas, relying on the contemporary (and etymological) meaning of “sex” \nwhen Title IX was enacted, adopted laws, policies, and procedures, and significantly \ninvested in an entire infrastructure to implement its education systems. The Final Rule \nupends  these important  reliance interests and usurps Texas’s sovereignty by adding \n“gender identity” and “sexual orientation.”  \n135.  The  Final  Rule  refuses  to  define  “gender  identity”  and  “sexual \norientation,” nor whether both fixed and fluid identities and orientations are protected.   \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 35 of 66   PageID 111\n136.  The Final Rule’s protections for an ever-fluctuating number of gender \nidentities and sexual orientations, which individuals can allegedly change at any time, \nanywhere, and for any (or no) reason, undermines Title IX’s original sex-based protections. \nSee United States v. Varner, 948 F.3d 250, 256–58 (5th Cir. 2020) (examining bewildering \nassortment of purported gender identities and bespoke pronouns). \n137.  Texas  independent  school  districts  and  Texas  public  universities  are \ninstrumentalities of the State. See, e.g., Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 \nS.W.3d 653, 660 (Tex. 2008). \n138.  Federal funding allocated to Texas’s post-secondary public universities, \ntechnical educational institutions, health-related educational institutions, and community \ncolleges is managed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (“THECB”). Ex. \nC ¶ 3. \n139.  In fiscal year 2022, Texas public universities received more than $3.8 billion \nin federal funding; Texas community colleges received more than $2.1 billion in federal \nfunds; Texas technical educational institutions received more than $100 million in federal \nfunds; and Texas health-related educational institutions received more than $1.5 billion in \nfederal funds. See Tex. Higher Educ. Coordinating Bd., Sources and Uses Report, at \nhttps://www.highered.texas.gov/our-work/supporting-our-institutions/institutional-\nfunding-resources/sources-and-uses/. \n140.  The  Final  Rule  threatens  to  withdraw  federal  funding  from  Texas \neducational  institutions.  The  Department  may  pursue  enforcement  actions  against \neducational facilities that are out of compliance with its aberrant interpretation of Title IX \nand penalize any institution deemed non-compliant by withholding funds. See U.S.C. \n§§ 1681, 1682; Exs. A ¶¶ 7–8, B ¶¶ 6–8, C ¶¶ 6–7. \n141.  Complying with Title IX costs Texas money. Texas educational institutions \nundertake internal efforts to ensure compliance with Title IX, including federal regulations \npromulgated pursuant to Title IX. These efforts involve but are not exhausted by hiring \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 36 of 66   PageID 112\nstaff to perform compliance reviews, facilitate the Title IX grievance process, and respond \nto lawsuits that stem from allegations of liability under Title IX protections. See Ex. D, Decl. \nof Rick Olshak ¶¶ 4–5. \n142.  These and other compliance efforts incur considerable expense to state \neducational facilities. The costs of complying with Title IX will likely increase when the \nDepartment of Education adopts new regulations that create additional requirements or \nmake existing requirements more demanding. See id. These include the administrative \ncosts  due  to  the  increased  caseload  caused  by  the  Final  Rule’s  lower  standard  for \nharassment, the extension of coverage to off-campus behavior, regulating covered third-\nparty entities, increased referrals to the Title IX Coordinators, updating training and \neducational materials for employees, and maintaining two different complaint processes. \nId.  \n143.  Even the Department’s low regulatory cost estimates reveal a substantial \nmonetary burden on state educational facilities. Overall, the Department estimates more \nthan $98 million in short-term compliance costs, some of which will fall on Texas schools. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,861. \n144.  Further aspects of the Department’s regulatory burden analysis reflect an \narbitrary and capricious consideration of relevant information. The Department failed to \nadequately consider how expanding Title IX to apply to gender identity would impose new \nregulatory burdens on recipients. With no reasonable explanation, the Department asserts \nthat extending Title IX protections to an entirely new class will not add new compliance \ncosts or create additional liability. See id. at 33,876.  \n145.  Contrary  to  the  Department,  responsible  deliberation  during  the \nrulemaking phase would have concluded that expanding Title IX’s anti-discrimination \nmandate to cover gender identity will likely increase costs for recipients, including Texas \neducational institutions.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 37 of 66   PageID 113\n146.  Nor could the Department have reasonably concluded that the new rule \nwould not interfere with local and State governments “in the exercise of their governmental \nfunctions.” Id. at 33,859.  \nB.  The Final Rule expands liability to Texas and other recipients of federal \neducation funds. \n147.  Educational institutions are subject to liability for alleged violations of Title \nIX. See generally, Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979); Fitzgerald v. Barnstable \nSch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, (2009). The Final Rule forces a waiver of Texas’s sovereign \nimmunity as to certain regulatory requirements without its consent. \n148.  The  Final  Rule  rolls  back  constitutional  safeguards  for  students  while \nexpanding  recipients’  liability  far  beyond  what  title  IX  allows.  These  changes  are \nunconstitutional.  \n149.  Indeed, the Final Rule goes so far as to reinterpret the word “sex” to include \n“sexual orientation” and “gender identity.”  \n150.  Not only does it reinvent the definition of “sex discrimination” to include \n“sexual orientation” and “gender identity” impermissibly, but the Final Rule also expands \nwhen, where, and how recipients must respond to claims of sexual harassment—extending \nto conduct that occurs online, off campus, outside the United States, or even before the \nrelevant individuals attended the school. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,386, 33,527.  \n151.  Additionally, the Final Rule amends the definition of “sexual harassment” \nin 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 to include unwelcome sex-based conduct (1) “that is sufficiently severe \nor pervasive,” and (2) “that based on the totality of the circumstances and evaluated \nsubjectively and objectively, denies or limits a person’s ability to participate in” the recipient’s \neducation program or activity. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,517 (emphasis added). \n152.   On its own, the redefinition of “sex discrimination” to include sexual \norientation and gender identity increases the odds of academic institutions intruding on \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 38 of 66   PageID 114\nprotected rights when seeking to enforce Title IX. But when combined with the other listed \nchanges, the danger becomes especially acute. \n153.   For example, the Final Rule directly curtails First Amendment and Due \nProcess protections for Texas students. It does this by lowering he standard for sex-based \nharassment to a “preponderance-of-the-evidence” standard; barring accused students \nfrom  access  to  evidence,  offering  them instead  a  mere  “description”  of  “relevant” \nevidence; and permitting recipients to adopt the investigator model, in which a single \n“decisionmaker” adjudicates the proceedings as prosecutor, judge, and jury. See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,891–95.  \n154.   These weakened standards are introduced at the same time the recipient’s \nliability expands. The Department thus gives recipients cause to initiate more zealous Title \nIX enforcement proceedings, reducing students’ access to a fair hearing when accused of \nharassment.  \n155.   Additionally, compared to the 2020 Rule, the standards advanced by the \nFinal Rule would create far more opportunities for recipients to inadvertently fall out of \ncompliance. The previous version of § 106.44(a) required recipients to “respond promptly \nin a manner that is not deliberately indifferent”—something they could achieve if their \nresponse was not “clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.” 2020 Rule, \n85 Fed. Reg. at 30,574. Recipients therefore had more flexibility in how to craft a response \nthat was appropriate to the facts and parties involved. Recipients were also judged based \non the information they had on hand without the benefit of hindsight, which the Final Rule \ncould allow. \n38 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 39 of 66   PageID 115\n156.   But the language in the Final Rule unlawfully shifts from the deliberate \nindifference standard which requires institutions to take actions reasonably calculated to \naddress allegations to a standard that requires their actions to be “effective.”4 \n157.   Yet institutions do not have an obligation under Title IX to eliminate \ndiscrimination; they are merely obligated to respond in a manner that is not clearly \nunreasonable.5  \n158.  The Final Rule greatly expands the scope of Title IX protections, thereby \nexpanding the range of conduct that could give rise to a lawsuit against Texas educational \ninstitutions. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,563 (“the recipient need not have incontrovertible \nproof that conduct violates Title IX for it to have an obligation to respond,” but rather “if \nthe  conduct  reasonably  may  be  sex  discrimination,  the  recipient  must  respond  in \naccordance with § 106.44” (emphasis added)).  \n159.  Because  the  Final  Rule  contradicts  existing  case  law,  including  the \ndeparture from Davis, grants institutions the permission to ditch live hearings, permits a \nsingle-investigator model, and revokes the right to cross-examination—the likelihood that \nTexas institutions will get sued and lose lawsuits is significant.  Texas schools are placed in \na no-win situation—where adherence to the Constitution risks the loss of federal funds.  \nC. The Final Rule infringes on Texas’s sovereignty. \n160.  The Final Rule injures Texas by obstructing its sovereign authority to \nenforce and administer its laws and by imposing substantial pressure on Texas to change \n \n4  “§ 106.44(a)  (1)  a  recipient  with  knowledge  of  conduct  that  reasonably  may \nconstitute sex discrimination in its education program or activity must respond promptly \nand effectively; and (2) a recipient must also comply with this section to address sex \ndiscrimination in its education program or activity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33563 (emphasis \nadded).  \n5 See Davis, 526 U.S. at 648–49 (“[C]ourts should refrain from second guessing the \ndisciplinary decisions made by school administrators,” who “must merely respond to \nknown peer harassment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.”) (citations omitted).  \n39 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 40 of 66   PageID 116\nits laws and policies. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982) (impeding a state’s sovereign interest in creating and enforcing a legal code \nwas an injury-in-fact sufficient to find standing); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 153 (5th Cir. 2015) (“[S]tates may have standing based on (1) federal assertions of \nauthority to regulate matters they believe they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, \nand (3) federal interference with the enforcement of state law[.]”). \n161.  The  Final  Rule  conflicts  with  Texas  law  governing  school  athletics \nprograms. \n162.  Texas  has  enacted  laws  to  protect  sex  separation  in  K-12  and  higher \neducation athletics programs.  \n163.  Texas  law  provides  that  “an  interscholastic  athletic  competition  team \nsponsored or authorized by a school district or open-enrollment charter school may not \nallow [] a student to compete in an interscholastic athletic competition sponsored or \nauthorized by the district or school that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the \nstudent’s biological sex.” Tex. Educ. Code § 33.0834; see also University Interscholastic \nLeague  Non-Discrimination  Policy,  Const.  sub.  J  (accessed  May  12,  2024)  (policy \nsegregating certain school sports based on sex), https://www.uiltexas.org/policy/constit\nution/general/nondiscrimination.  \n164.  The Final Rule prohibits separation based on biological sex in K-12 athletics \nteams, which indicates that the Department will investigate K-12 schools for following \nTexas law and provides that the Department may sanction the schools by withholding \nfederal funding for complying with Texas law. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. \n165.  Texas law also provides that “an intercollegiate athletic team sponsored or \nauthorized by an institution of higher education may not allow a student to compete on the \nteam in an intercollegiate athletic competition sponsored or authorized by the institution \nthat is designated for the biological sex opposite to the student’s biological sex.” Tex. Educ. \nCode. § 51.980. \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 41 of 66   PageID 117\n166.  The Final Rule’s prohibition on the separation of education athletics teams \nbased on biological sex will subject institutions of higher education to investigation (and \npossibly sanctions) by the Department merely for complying with Texas law. See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,886. \n167.  The Final Rule also conflicts with the policies adopted by some of Texas’s \npolitical subdivisions—pursuant to authority granted by state law—regarding separating \nschool bathrooms and locker rooms by biological sex.  For example, the Carroll, Frisco, and \nGrapevine–Colleyville Independent School Districts require schools owned or operated by \nthe districts to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, shower rooms, and other similar facilities \nbased on biological sex determined at birth and correctly identified on a person’s birth \ncertificate.  \n168.  Under Texas statute, independent school districts are expressly authorized \nto exercise State power by implementing local policies; the trustees of ISDs “have the \nexclusive power and duty to govern and oversee the management of the public schools of \nthe district.” Tex. Educ. Code § 11.151(b).The Final Rule conflicts with each of these \npolicies by treating them as unlawful sex discrimination and by requiring school districts to \nchange their policies to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and changing facilities \nbased on gender identity instead of biological sex to remain in compliance with the Rule. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. \n169.  The Final Rule requires using pronouns that are consistent with a person’s \ngender identity rather than biological sex, which conflicts with policies adopted by some of \nTexas’s political subdivisions and is not required by Texas state law. For example, the \nCarroll and Grapevine–Colleyville Independent School Districts have adopted policies that \nprohibit district employees from requiring the use of pronouns that are inconsistent with a \nperson’s biological sex as correctly identified on a person’s birth certificate or other \ngovernment-issued record.   \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 42 of 66   PageID 118\n170.  The Final Rule conflicts with these policies by treating them as unlawful sex \ndiscrimination and by requiring school districts to change their policies to use pronouns \nbased on a person’s gender identity instead of biological sex to remain in compliance with \nthe Final Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. Compliance with the Final Rule would expose \nthe school districts to liability for violating district employees’ and students’ religious \nfreedom and free speech rights, despite district policies protecting those rights. \n171.  The Final Rule explicitly preempts contrary state laws and directs recipients \nof Title IX funding to comply with the Final Rule in the event of a conflict with state law.  \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885. These injuries are sufficient to establish Texas’s standing. \n172.  The Final Rule also purports to override Texas’s abortion prohibitions.  \n173.  The Final Rule purports to protect women who abort their pregnancies, \neven when doing so violates Texas law.  \n174.  The Final Rule purports to ban “discrimination” against anyone who has \nhad an abortion, even if the abortion was illegal.  \n175.  The  Final  Rule  defines  “pregnancy  or  related  conditions”  to  include \n“termination of pregnancy.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,883 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2).  \n176.  The Final Rule stipulates that every recipient of federal funds, including \neducational institutions, must treat abortion on the same terms as “any other temporary \nmedical  condition.”  See  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,887–888  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.40(b)(6)(vi)(4) (“[A] recipient must treat pregnancy or related conditions in the \nsame manner and under the same policies as any other temporary medical conditions.”).  \n177.  Accordingly, the Final Rule requires all healthcare plans offered by every \neducational institution to cover abortion on the same terms as “any other temporary \nmedical condition.” Id. \n178.  The Final Rule also requires schools to excuse a student’s absence for \n“terminat[ing] [her] pregnancy” even when doing so violates Texas law. See id. \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 43 of 66   PageID 119\n179.  This  provision  of  the  Final  Rule  is  another  attempt  by  the  Biden \nAdministration to nullify Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2242 \n(2022). The Supreme Court has held that “the Constitution does not confer a right to \nabortion” and “does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting \nabortion.” Id. at 2279, 2284.  \n180.  In accordance with Dobbs, Texas regulates and prohibits abortions.  \n181.  Under Texas’s Human Life Protection Act, “[a] person may not knowingly \nperform, induce, or attempt an abortion.” Tex. Health & Safety Code § 170A.002. That \nprohibition does not apply if the woman on whom the abortion is performed “has a life-\nthreatening physical condition” arising from a pregnancy that places her “at risk of death \nor poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the \nabortion is performed.” Tex. Health & Safety Code § 170A.002(b)(2). Texas law imposes \ncriminal and civil penalties for violation of this law. See Tex. Health & Safety Code \n§§ 170A.004–.005; Tex. Penal Code § 12.32–.33.  \n182.  In addition to the Human Life Protection Act, Texas statutes predating Roe \nv. Wade also address the subject of abortion. See Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 4512.1–.4, .6 \nUnder those statutes, any person who causes an abortion is guilty of an offense and shall be \nconfined in a penitentiary. Id. at 4512.1. Moreover, an individual may not act as an \naccomplice to abortion or an attempted abortion. Id. at 4512.2–.3. However, it is not an \noffense if the abortion is performed under “medical advice for the purpose of saving the \nlife of the mother.” Id. at 45.12.6.  \n183.  The Texas pre-Roe statutes also impose felony criminal liability on any \nperson who engages in conduct in Texas that “procures” an abortion, as well as any person \nwho aids or abets this procuring conduct. See Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 4512.1. \n184.  Plaintiffs Hatfield and Bonevac do not intend to accommodate student \nabsences from class to obtain abortions—including illegal abortions and purely elective \nabortions that are not medically required. Nor will Plaintiffs Hatfield and Bonevac hire a \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 44 of 66   PageID 120\nteaching  assistant  who  has  violated  the  abortion  laws  of  Texas  or  the  federal-law \nprohibitions on the shipment or receipt of abortion pills and abortion-related paraphernalia. \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1461–1462.  \n185.  The Final Rule purports to preempt Texas’ laws by requiring its schools to \nprotect actions that would otherwise violate State law. This violates Texas’s “sovereign \ninterest in the power to create and enforce a legal code.” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 153 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted).  \n186.  Texas’s injuries are directly traceable to the Final Rule. They would be \nredressed by the relief sought in this case, see Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir. \n2019), which includes staying and ultimately vacating the Final Rule under the APA, and \npreliminarily and permanently enjoining its enforcement, as well as any further attempts to \ninterpret, apply, or enforce Title IX as including sexual orientation or gender identity in its \nanti-discrimination mandate. \n187.  Likewise, an injunction restraining the Department from applying the Final \nRule to the State would also restrain the Department from applying the Rule to subdivisions \nof the State, including Texas ISDs, thereby redressing injuries caused by depriving ISDs of \npolicies based on respecting biological sex differences. See Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass'n, \n555 U.S. 353, 362-64 (2009); see also Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 557 (6th Cir. \n2023) (“An injunction barring the federal government from enforcing the mandate against \nthe States would also run to the States’ subdivisions and thus would not encroach on the \nStates’ own vaccination policies for state employees)”. \n \n44 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 45 of 66   PageID 121\nVI.  Claims \nCount I \nThe Final Rule Exceeds Statutory Authority  \nand is Not in Accordance with Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n188.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n189.  The Final Rule is a final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 \nbecause it was published in the Federal Register following notice-and-comment. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,474. Texas lacks another adequate remedy by which to challenge the Final Rule, \nand no legal authority requires that Texas appeal to a superior agency prior to seeking \njudicial review. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n190.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory… authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), (C). This is because “[a]dministrative \nagencies  are  creatures  of  statute”  and  “accordingly  possess  only  the  authority  that \nCongress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022).  \n191.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law and exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority because the plain language of Title IX and its implementing regulations \nallow recipients of federal education funds to distinguish between biological males and \nbiological females in situations the Final Rule condemns. And the correct interpretation of \nTitle IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” does not include protections \nfor the concepts of sexual orientation or gender identity. Nor does Title IX reach issues of \npregnancy discrimination or require professors to accommodate students who skip class to \nobtain abortions. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974). Nor does Title IX require \nprofessors and universities to accommodate or employ students who have engaged in the \nshipment or receipt of abortion pills and abortion-related paraphernalia in violation of \nfederal  law.  See  18  U.S.C.  § 1461–1462.  And  Title  IX  does  not  require  educational \ninstitutions that receive federal funds to cover abortions in student health-insurance plans. \n45 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 46 of 66   PageID 122\nSee 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(6)(vi)(4). Even if Bostock applied to Title IX, the Final Rule must \nstill be vacated as “not in accordance with law” because its requirements extend far beyond \nBostock’s interpretation of “sex” discrimination.  \n192.  The Final Rule effectively rewrites the statute from one requiring equal \nopportunity for both sexes (often through the explicit consideration of biologically based \nsex differences) into one that requires recipients to engage in sex discrimination in order to \naccommodate someone’s internal sense of gender identity. Indeed, the Final Rule flips \nTitle IX on its head by closing off opportunities to women—the very group the statute was \ndesigned to protect. See, e.g., Soule v. Connecticut Ass’n of Sch., Inc., No. 3:20-cv-201, 2021 \nWL 1617206 (D. Conn. Apr. 25, 2021) (dismissing as moot a suit brought by a group of high \nschool female track athletes seeking to stop two biological males from participating in girls’ \ntrack competitions), aff’d, 57 F.4th 43 (2d Cir. 2022) and vacated and remanded sub nom. 90 \nF.4th 34 (2d Cir. 2023).  \n193.  As a result of the Final Rule, women, among other things, (a) will be \ndeprived of equal athletic opportunities, such as scholarships; (b) will be forced to accept \nclaims about what  makes a person  a woman that often rely on sex stereotypes and \ncaricatures; (c) will be put in situations that compromise their bodily privacy; and (d) will \nlikely suffer increased sexual violence since the Final Rule fails to provide any safeguards \nagainst sexual predators who claim a female gender identity in order to gain access to \nwomen-only spaces.  \n194.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law and exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority because it relies upon the interpretation of Title VII described in Bostock \nand applies it to Title IX, despite the textual and structural differences between the two \nstatutes and the express disclaimer in Bostock that its holding did not apply to other federal \nor state laws. See Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (observing \nthat “Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects”). \n46 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 47 of 66   PageID 123\n195.  Defendants  lack  authority  to  issue,  implement,  enforce,  or  rely  on \nregulations that undermine the purpose of Title IX and are contrary to its text and \nstructure. They cannot circumvent these limitations by citing to a narrow Supreme Court \nholding involving the interpretation of an unrelated statute that was enacted nearly a \ndecade later, pursuant to a different constitutional power.  \n196.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law and exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority because it expands recipients’ liability beyond the scope of the statute. \nThe Final Rule expands Title IX to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, \nsex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender \nidentity.” Id. These other grounds, however, are not interchangeable with sex.  \n197.  In addition, Title IX limits recipients’ obligations to discrimination that \noccur “under” their “education programs or activities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); see also id.at \n§ 1687  (defining  programs  and  activities).  This  means  that  the  discrimination  or \nharassment “must take place in a context subject to the school district's control.” Davis, \n526 U.S. at 645. \n198.  The  Final  Rule  nevertheless  obliges  recipients  to  “promptly  and \neffectively” address “conduct that occurs in a building owned or controlled by a student \norganization,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (34 C.F.R. § 106.11), 33,888 (34 C.F.R. § 106.44); \nmisconduct occurring off campus (online or otherwise) or even “outside the United \nStates,”  id.;  and  activities  that  occurred  before  any  of  the  individuals  attended  the \nacademic, id. at 33,527.  \n199.  The combination of recipients’ heightened liability under the Final Rule, \nthe redefinition of “on the basis of sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity, \nand the rejection of the Davis standard for determining sex-based harassment, will force \nrecipients, including Texas, to intrude on individuals’ free speech and due process rights if \nthey are to remain compliant with the regulations. Defendants lack authority under Title \nIX to induce public institutions to violate the U.S. Constitution.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 48 of 66   PageID 124\n200.  The  Final  Rule  is  also  not  in  accordance  with  law  and  exceeds  the \nDepartment’s statutory authority because Title IX demands that recipients provide equal \ntreatment to both sexes, yet the Final Rule instructs recipients to establish grievance \nprocedures that treat respondents “equitably.” See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33891 (34 C.F.R. \n106.45(b)(1)).  \n201.  The Final Rule does not define “equity” or “equitably,” but Defendants \nhave interpreted the terms elsewhere as necessitating the disparate treatment of individuals \nbased  their  perceived  privilege—the  determination  of  which  partially  turns  on  an \nindividual’s sex. To the extent that the Final Rule permits disparate treatment on the basis \nof sex, it contradicts the text, structure, and purpose of Title IX.  \n202.  The Final Rule attempts to impose a legal duty on recipients of federal funds \nto protect women who abort their pregnancies even when that abortion violates State law. \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. 33,887–888.  \n203.  Defendants did not act in accordance with the law and exceeded their \nstatutory and regulatory authority when promulgating the Final Rule, and they do not act \nin accordance with the law and exceed their statutory and regulatory authority when \nenforcing the policies set forth in these regulations. “Vacatur is the normal remedy under \nthe APA, which provides that a reviewing court ‘shall ... set aside’ unlawful agency action.” \nLong Island Power Auth. v. FERC, 27 F.4th 705, 717 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)). \n48 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 49 of 66   PageID 125\nCount II \nThe Final Rule is Contrary to U.S. Constitution \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n204.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n205.  The Final Rule is a final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 \nbecause it was published in the Federal Register following notice-and-comment. 89 Fed. \nReg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024). Texas lacks another adequate remedy by which to challenge \nthe Final Rule, and no legal authority requires that Texas appeal to a superior agency prior \nto seeking judicial review. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n206.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat  is  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(B). \nFREE SPEECH RESTRICTIONS \n207.  The Final Rule violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it \nimposes  viewpoint-based  and  content-based  restrictions  on  students  and  employees \naffiliated with recipients and compels public entities, like Texas, to enforce said restrictions \nat risk of the federal funds. Specifically, the Final Rule deliberately discards the standard \nfor actionable sexual harassment articulated by the Supreme Court in Davis and adopted \nby the Department in its 2020 rulemaking, in favor of a weaker standard that requires \nschools to police wide swaths of constitutionally protected activity.  \n208.  In Davis, the Court held that recipients can violate Title IX only if they have \n“actual knowledge” of sexual harassment and are “deliberately indifferent” to it. 526 U.S. \nat 650. And the harassment in question must be “so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education.” Id. at 652 (emphases \nadded).  This  standard  intentionally  excludes  “a  single  instance  of  one-on-one  peer \nharassment,” even if “sufficiently severe,” and harassment that has only negative effects \nlike “a mere ‘decline in grades.’” Id. at 652-53.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 50 of 66   PageID 126\n209.  When crafting the Davis standard, the Supreme Court made clear that it \nchose this stringent definition in part to avoid constitutional concerns. E.g., id. at 648-49, \n652-53. In the dissent, Justice Kennedy had argued that, if schools are liable for student-on-\nstudent harassment, then they will adopt “campus speech codes” that “may infringe \nstudents’ First Amendment rights.” Id. at 682; see id. at 667 (noting that schools’ “power \nto discipline its students” for harassment is “circumscribed by the First Amendment”). In \nresponse, the majority explained that its narrow definition accounts for “the practical \nrealities of responding to student behavior.” Id. at 652-53 (citing the dissent). Those \n“practical  realities,”  the  Court  agreed,  include  the  need  to  comply  with  the  First \nAmendment. See id. at 649 (agreeing with the dissent that schools face “legal constraints \non their disciplinary authority” and explaining that its interpretation of Title IX would not \nrequire universities to risk “liability” via “constitutional … claims”). \n210.  Notably, Davis refused to adopt the definition of harassment that governs \nthe workplace under Title VII. While actionable harassment under Title VII can be “severe \nor pervasive,” students are not employees and Title IX’s “severe and pervasive” standard \nreflects the greater First Amendment concerns that arise in the educational context. See id. \nat 651 (emphases added; distinguishing Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 \n(1986)). In short, “the school is not the workplace.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 808 (discussing \nDavis). \n211.  Hence why the Trump administration “adopt[ed]” the Davis standard \n“verbatim.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,036; accord id. at 30,151-52, 30,164-65 & nn.738-39; 34 \nC.F.R.  §106.30(a).  Broader  definitions  of  harassment,  the  Department  found,  have \n“infringed on constitutionally protected speech” and have led “‘many potential speakers \nto conclude that it is better to stay silent.’” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,164-65 & nn.738-39. \nAccording to the Department then, the Davis standard “ensures that speech … is not \nperemptorily chilled or restricted” because it applies only when harassment rises to the \n50 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 51 of 66   PageID 127\nlevel of “serious conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.” Id. at 30,151-52 (emphasis \nadded); accord id. at 30,162-63. \n212.  The Department now thinks the Supreme Court’s definition isn’t good \nenough; its new definition deviates from Davis in several key ways \n213.  The Final Rule expands Title IX to cover harassment that’s “severe or \npervasive,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884, rather than “severe and pervasive,” Davis, 526 U.S. at \n652–53. And the Final Rule applies even if the harassment merely “limits” a person’s \n“ability to participate in or benefit from” a program or activity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884, \nrather  than  “denies”  a  person  “access  to  the  educational  opportunities  or  benefits \nprovided by the school,” Davis, 526 U.S. at 651–53. Broader still, the rule requires \nrecipients to “promptly and effectively end any sex discrimination,” regardless whether \nthey were deliberately indifferent to it. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (Proposed 34 C.F.R. \n§106.44(f)(1)); contra Davis, 526 U.S. at 650–52. As a result, the Final Rule’s new hostile-\nenvironment definition thus covers a single or isolated incident and all negative effects like  \na choice to skip class, or a decision not to attend a campus activity. Davis, 526 U.S. at 652–\n53; accord 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511 (“[A] complainant must demonstrate some impact on their \nability to participate or benefit from the education program or activity, but the definition \ndoes not specify any particular limits or denials.”). And the Final Rule’s new definition \nwould force students and teachers to, for example, use someone’s “preferred pronouns.” \nWhat’s worse, the Final Rule extends to conduct that occurs online, off campus, outside \nthe United States, or even before the relevant individuals attended the school. 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,886, 33,527. \n214.  At the same time, the Final Rule expands recipients’ obligations far beyond \nwhat  Title  IX  allows,  such  as  by  reinterpreting  the  word  “sex”  to  include  “sexual \norientation” and “gender identity.” Hence, not only does the Final Rule fundamentally \nrewrite Title IX’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination, but the failure to affirm a \nstudent’s  gender  identity  would  constitute  “sex-based  harassment”  under  the  new \n51 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 52 of 66   PageID 128\nregulations since it could have negative effects that constitute more than a de minimis \nharm. \n215.  Recipients  have  an  obligation  under  the  Final  Rule  to  “take  specific \nactions … to promptly and effectively prevent sex discrimination,” including what the \nFinal Rule defines as sex-based harassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. It follows that recipients \nwould have an obligation under the Final Rule to confront students and employees who \nrefuse to affirm someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, up to and including \ndisciplinary proceedings, or risk enforcement proceedings against them for noncompliance.  \nOVERBREADTH \n216.  The Final Rule violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it is \nvague and overbroad. The Final Rule promulgates an expansive definition of “sex-based \nharassment” that covers all “unwelcome” expression—even personal speech made in \nonline  forums  off  campus—that  might  be  deemed  (1)  “subjectively  and  objectively \noffensive” and (2) “so severe or pervasive” that the expressive activity “limits” students’ \neducational participation even slightly. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (amending  34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.02). \n217.  In  addition,  the  Final  Rule  enlarged  the  range  of  subjects  in  which \nexpressive conduct may cause offense to include sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, as well as sexual orientation and gender identity. This \nbroad framework inhibits First Amendment rights by chilling, or risking liability over, \nstudents’ expression on deeply held views regarding significant moral and political issues \nthat in no way resemble the hostile environment that these regulations allegedly target.  \n218.  In  short,  a  substantial  number  of  the  Final  Rule’s  applications  are \nunconstitutional, when judged in relation to the regulations legitimate sweep. United States \nv. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Wash. \nState Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 n.6 (2008)). \n52 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 53 of 66   PageID 129\nVOID FOR VAGUENESS \n219.  The Final Rule violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment because it (1) \n“fails to provide those targeted by the [regulations] a reasonable opportunity to know what \nconduct is prohibited,” Moore v. Brown, 868 F.3d 398, 406 (5th Cir. 2017), and (2) \n“authorizes” and “even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Hill v. \nColorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000).  \n220.  Although “‘perfect clarity and precise guidance’ are not required,” Doe I v. \nLandry, 909 F.3d 99, 117 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. \n781, 794 (1989)), laws and regulations must provide “sufficient definiteness” that ordinary \npeople can understand what is being prohibited, Roark & Hardee LP v. City of Austin, 522 \nF.3d 533, 552 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983)).  \n221.  The  Final  Rule,  however,  demarcates  permissible  and  impermissible \nconduct  based  on  a  complainant’s  subjective  and  idiosyncratic  response,  which  is \nunknowable beforehand. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,510 (noting that subjective standard is \nbased on the complainant’s perspective). The Department likewise concedes that “gender \nidentity” turns on “an individual’s sense of their gender,” which the Final Rule neither \nexplains nor defines. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809.  \n222.  Not only do these regulations deny ordinary persons fair notice of what \nspeech and conduct would cause more than a de minimis harm, but their broad sweep \nallows recipients, coordinators, investigators, and OCR’s enforcement division “to pursue \ntheir personal predilections” when carrying out the law. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, \n358  (1983).  The  result  will  be  a  regime  that  falls  more  heavily  on  unpopular  and \ncontroversial opinions while giving orthodox positions a pass.  \nDUE PROCESS RIGHTS \n223.  The Final Rule violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by inducing \nrecipients, including public entities like Texas, to deny students and employees due process \nprotections when accused of sex-based harassment. Circuit courts across the country \n53 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 54 of 66   PageID 130\nrecognize that students have protected constitutional interests in their pursuit of higher \neducation. See, e.g., Plummer v. Univ. of Hous., 860 F.3d 767, 774 & n.6 (5th Cir. 2017). And \nthe Supreme Court has assumed such rights in deciding due process cases in the higher \neducation context. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 222–23 (1985).  \n224.  The fundamental tenets of due process require public schools to avoid \narbitrary decision making and reduce the risk of erroneous deprivations of protected rights \nby balancing the individual’s interests with the cost of additional due process measures that \nwould guard against that risk. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). The 2020 Rule \nestablished a procedural due process standard that would pass constitutional muster in \nmost, if not all, cases. But instead of preserving this benchmark, the Final Rule eliminated \nor made discretionary many of the safeguards that protected students and employees \naccused of harassment from arbitrary decision-making.  \n225.  Although the specific requirements of constitutional due process vary on a \ncase-by-case basis, including in the Title IX context, the Final Rule’s overhaul of Title IX \ngrievance procedures has serious implications for individual due process rights. The Texas \nAttorney General explained during the notice-and-comment period that the Department \nwas reducing protections at the same time it was amplifying recipients’ liability. The \ncombination  will  pressure  recipients  to  curtail  the  rights  of  the  accused  below  the \nconstitutional minimum, as it did when the Department issued its 2011 Dear Colleague \nLetter.  \n \nCount III \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n226.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n54 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 55 of 66   PageID 131\n227.  The Final Rule is a final agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 \nbecause it was published in the Federal Register following notice-and-comment. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,474. Texas lacks another adequate remedy by which to challenge the Final Rule, \nand no legal authority requires that Texas appeal to a superior agency prior to seeking \njudicial review. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n228.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary,” “capricious,” or “an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). This \nmeans if an agency action is not “reasonable and reasonably explained,” it must be vacated. \nWages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1136 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)); see Encino Motorcars, LLC v. \nNavarro, 579 U.S. 211, 224 (2016) (“[A] lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that \nis inconsistent with the Department’s longstanding earlier position results in a rule that \ncannot carry the force of law.”). \n229.  “Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency \nhas relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that \nruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n230.  Defendants did not engage in reasoned decision-making, but instead acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the Final Rule.  \n231.  To summarize a few flaws, the Rule is internally inconsistent, fails to define \nkey terms, disregards evidence submitted, makes decisions that are counter to the evidence \nbefore the Department, fails to properly balance all the relevant interests that would be \naffected  by  the  Department’s  changed  position,  and  routinely  offers  “conclusory \nstatements”  rather  than  real  responses  to  valid  and  serious  concerns  submitted  by \ncommenters. See Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 473 (5th Cir. 2024). \n55 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 56 of 66   PageID 132\n232.  The  Final  Rule  fails  arbitrary-and-capricious  review  because  the \nDepartment neglected to offer a reasoned explanation for the Final Rule’s departure from \nthe historic understanding—including within previous Title IX regulations—of Title IX’s \nprohibition on “sex” discrimination. The Department noted during its 2020 regulations \nthat “Title IX and its implementing regulations include provisions that presuppose sex as \na binary classification.” It further observed that provisions in the Department’s then-\nexisting regulations reflected that premise. 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,178.  \n233.  Instead of confronting this history, the Department deflected by referencing \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock, but that is insufficient given the textual and \nstructural differences between the two statutes and the express disclaimer in Bostock that \nits holding did not apply to other laws. The Department compounds the problems with its \nanalysis by dismissing multiple court opinions, including from this Court, that recognized \n“Bostock … was limited only to Title VII itself” and “does not stretch to [other statutes].” \nPelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); Neese, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668; \ncompare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,806.  \n234.  In  addition,  when  an  agency  changes  its  position,  the  agency  must \n“recognize[ ] the change, reason[ ] through it without factual or legal error, and balance[ ], \nall relevant interests affected by the change.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 469. The Department, \nhowever, refused to dutifully consider the reliance interest Texas and other recipients had \nwith respect to the Department’s historic understanding of Title IX.  \n235.  Nor  did  the  Department  address  the  States’  practical  concerns  about \nauthenticating gender identity or the risk that the Department’s policy would pose to \nstudent  safety  and  privacy.  The  Department  had  before  it  significant  evidence  that \npermitting individuals who identify as transgender to use bathrooms or locker rooms \nassociated with their gender identity, as opposed to their biological sex, subjected students \nto distress and embarrassment as well as an increased risk of harassment or assault. Yet, its \nresponse simply stated that the Department “does not agree.” 89 Fed. Reg.at 33,820.  \n56 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 57 of 66   PageID 133\n236.  This  dismissal  of  commenters’  substantive  concerns  characterized  the \nentire rulemaking process. \n237.  The  Final  Rule  also  fails  arbitrary-and-capricious  review  because  it  is \ncontradictory,  failing  to  reasonably  explain  treating  like  circumstances  differently.  It \ndeclines to apply its gender-identity mandate to “living facilities” by pointing to the \nstatutory exceptions in 20 U.S.C. § 1681(1)-(9). 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,818–19. But it \napplies its mandate to “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” permitted to be sex-\nseparated by rule, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \n238.  The Final Rule also fails the test of reasoned decision-making by failing to \naddress  how  its  gender-identity  mandate  applies  to  “nonbinary,”  “bisexual,”  or \n“questioning individuals.” \n239.  The Final Rule’s cost-benefit analysis is also wholly deficient. The Final \nRule assumes the average time to read and understand the final, 423-page regulation will \nbe 4 hours for a Title IX Coordinator and lawyers, which defies belief. See 89 Fed. Reg at \n33,867. The Rule’s other cost-and-benefit assumptions are equally absurd, including its \nfailure to include any construction costs based on Defendants’ refusal to acknowledge the \nFinal Rule will require schools to modify bathrooms and locker rooms. See, e.g., 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,876.  \n240.  Turning to the Final Rule’s other changes, the Final Rule fails arbitrary-\nand-capricious  review  because  the  Department  neglected  to  reasonably  consider  the \nconstitutional concerns raised by its new definition of sex-based harassment, its new \ngeographic scope, and the reduction of due process protections for those accused of \nmisconduct—let alone taken together. The Department likewise failed to consider how \nthese new provisions affect recipients’ liability.  \n241.  Take, for example, the Final Rule’s new definition of sex-based harassment. \nThe Department first contends that it “is not required to adopt the Gebser/Davis standard” \nat all because those cases were private lawsuits, not “administrative enforcement.” 89 Fed. \n57 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 58 of 66   PageID 134\nReg. at 33,560. This reasoning makes no sense. The Supreme Court was interpreting Title \nIX. Whether a private plaintiff is bringing a lawsuit or the Department is bringing an \nenforcement action, the language of Title IX is the same. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. \n371, 380-81 (2005) (courts cannot construe the same statute one way in one factual context \nand another way in another factual context). As are the concerns that the Court articulated \nin Davis, including the First Amendment concerns that arise by overly broad definitions of \nharassment.  Title  IX  is  not  “a  chameleon”  whose  “meaning  [is]  subject  to  change \ndepending on the presence or absence of constitutional concerns in each individual case.” \nId. at 382. Davis based its standard on what Title IX “makes clear,” yet the Department \ndeviates from Davis’s clear instruction without a reasoned justification. Davis, 526 U.S. at \n650.  Here,  Davis’s  “lowest  common  denominator,”  which  takes  account  for  the \nconstitutional concerns, must control. Clark, 543 U.S. at 380. \n242.  Unlike the 2020 Rule, the Final Rule contradicts Davis when it expands \nTitle IX to cover harassment that’s “severe or pervasive,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884, rather \nthan “severe and pervasive,” Davis, 526 U.S. at 652–53. And the Final Rule applies even \nif the harassment merely “limits” a person’s “ability to participate in or benefit from” a \nprogram or activity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884, rather than “denies” a person “access to the \neducational opportunities or benefits provided by the school,” Davis, 526 U.S. at 651–53. \nBroader  still,  the  rule  requires  recipients  to  “promptly  and  effectively  end  any  sex \ndiscrimination,” regardless of whether they were deliberately indifferent to it. See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,889 (Proposed 34 C.F.R. §106.44(f)(1)); contra Davis, 526 U.S. at 650–52. As a \nresult, the Final Rule’s new hostile-environment definition thus covers a single or isolated \nincident and all negative effects like a choice to skip class, or a decision not to attend a \ncampus activity. Davis, 526 U.S. at 652–53; accord 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511 (“[A] complainant \nmust demonstrate some impact on their ability to participate or benefit from the education \nprogram or activity, but the definition does not specify any particular limits or denials.”). \nAnd the Final Rule’s new definition would force students and teachers to, for example, use \n58 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 59 of 66   PageID 135\nsomeone’s “preferred pronouns.” What’s worse, the Final Rule extends to conduct that \noccurs  online,  off  campus,  outside  the  United  States,  or  even  before  the  relevant \nindividuals attended the school. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886, 33,527. And because the Final Rule \nthus  raises  First  Amendment  and  other  constitutional  concerns,  Defendants  acted \narbitrarily and capriciously when they failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking in \naddressing these concerns. \n243.  Defendants  also  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  when  they  failed  to \nreasonably consider the lose-lose situation the Final Rule places on funding recipients \nthrough its illegal redefinition of “sex-based harassment.” Justice Kennedy warned in his \ndissent for four Justices that “[o]n college campuses, and even in secondary schools, a \nstudent’s claim that the school should remedy a sexually hostile environment will conflict \nwith the alleged harasser’s claim that his speech, even if offensive, is protected by the First \nAmendment. In each of these situations, the school faces the risk of suit, and maybe even \nmultiple suits,  regardless  of  its  response.” Davis, 526  U.S. at 682–83  (Kennedy, J., \ndissenting). The majority avoided this problem by stressing the deliberate-indifference \nrequirement  to  liability  and  the  stringent  definition  of  actionable  harassment.  By \nabandoning the deliberate-indifference requirement, the Department unravels Davis’s \nreasoning.  \n244.  The  Department’s  hostile-environment  definition  is  also  internally \ninconsistent,  rendering  the  rule  arbitrary  and  capricious.  It  stresses  a  “totality  of \ncircumstances” test  that  considers, among other things, “[t]he degree to which the \nconduct affected the complainant’s ability to access the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. §106.2). But that factor is in tension with the \nDepartment’s other statement that “sex-based conduct meets the ‘severe or pervasive’ \nstandard of sex-based harassment if it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,508. The \nDepartment reads out “severe or pervasive” from its definition. It is not clear why the \n59 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 60 of 66   PageID 136\ndegree of harm matters if the only requirement is that the harassment “limits” the \nindividuals’ ability to participate in education, and the Department provides no reasonable \nexplanation justifying this tension.  \n245.  Further, the Department’s action is arbitrary and capricious because it fails \nto  reasonably  address  comments  on  misgendering.  The  Department  noted  that  a \ncommenter raised the Department’s “recent resolution letter finding that a school district \nviolated Title IX when it failed to effectively respond to a misgendering of a student.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,516. Other commentators also “urged” the Department to state that \n“misgendering is a form of sex-based harassment that can create a hostile environment.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516. Many commentators also raised the notice of proposed rulemakings \nseeming  approval  of  the  2016  Dear  Colleague  Letter,  stating  that  misgendering  is \npunishable  harassment. Rather than  address these comments or the 2016 letter, the \nDepartment did not meaningfully engage with either comment or even cite the 2016 letter, \nbut merely stated that the issue “is necessarily fact-specific” and that “a stray remark, such \nas a misuse of language, would not constitute harassment under this standard.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,516. The terse statement is hardly “‘reasoned decisionmaking.’” Michigan, 576 \nU.S. at 750. Commentators put the Department on notice of the 2016 letter and the \nresolution, so the Department was obligated to address those “relevant authorit[ies]” and \nexplain any “inconsistencies” or differences in position. Data Mktg., 45 F.4th at 857.  \n246.  The Texas Attorney General alerted the Department during the notice-and-\ncomment period that the combination of heighten liability and diminished safeguards \nwould  pressure  recipients  into  violating  the  constitutional  rights  of  students  and \nemployees, as demonstrated by the aftermath of the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter. The \nDepartment’s response was simply that “nothing in the regulations requires or authorizes \na recipient to violate anyone’s [constitutional] rights.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516. \n247.  “[B]are acknowledgement” of a concern “is no substitute for reasoned \nconsideration.” Louisiana, 90 F.4th at 473. The Final Rule charges recipients to “promptly \n60 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 61 of 66   PageID 137\nand effectively” respond to “conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,888. It then defines sex discrimination so broadly that recipients would \nbe in violation of their obligations if they did not step in to “end” protected activity, \n“prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.” Id. at 33,592.  \n248.  Indeed, the Final Rule’s boilerplate denials of authorizing violations of the \nFirst Amendment are contradictory and omit discussion of relevant factors. The Final Rule \nincorporates EEOC gender-identity guidance, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516, which states that \n“intentionally and repeatedly using the wrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender \nemployee could contribute to an unlawful work environment.” EEOC, Sexual Orientation \nand Gender Identity (SOGI) Discrimination, https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-orientation-and-\ngender-identity-sogi-discrimination#:~:text=Although%20accidental%20misuse% \n20of%20a,an%20unlawful%20hostile%20work%20environment. But requiring employees to \nuse pronouns based on gender identity rather than biological sex is unconstitutional.  \n249.  It is not enough for the Department to say that the Final Rule accommodates \nrecipients’ constitutional limits when a fair (and more natural) reading of the regulations \nlead to an opposite result. Furthermore, courts have recognized a private right of action. \nEven  if  the  Department  elects  not  to  initiate  enforcement  proceedings  in  such \ncircumstances, Texas and other public recipients would still be subject to litigation from \nprivate individuals.  \n250.  Texas should not have to risk liability for respecting the rights of its students \nand employees.  \n251.  The Department also failed to adequately articulate its departure from \nestablished Supreme Court precedent governing Title IX, as well as policies adopted by the \nDepartment in previous rulemakings. For example, the 2020 Rule adopted the Supreme \nCourt’s deliberate-indifference requirement for liability because “the recipient cannot \ncommit its own misconduct unless the recipient first knows of the sexual harassment that \nneeds to be addressed.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,432. The Department now changes course, \n61 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 62 of 66   PageID 138\nasserting that it “is not required to adopt the Gebser/Davis standard” because “the \nstandard for administrative enforcement is not derived from the same implied remedy \ndiscussed in Gebser and Davis.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,560.  \n252.  This reasoning is arbitrary and capricious. Not only does it fail to explain the \nreason for the about face, but the agency has no authority to override the Supreme Court’s \ninterpretations  of  Title  IX.  Whether  a  private  plaintiff  is  bringing  a  lawsuit,  or  the \nDepartment is bringing an enforcement action, the language of Title IX is the same. The \nSupreme Court in Davis determined when a school could be liable for sex-based harassment \nand articulated a definition of actionable harassment standard that balanced the objectives \nof Title IX with the constitutional interests of respondents, which the Department adopted \nin the 2020 Rule. The Department has no right to define actionable harassment differently \nfrom the Supreme Court. The Final Rule also fails to recognize how its standard regarding \ngender-identity discrimination undercuts its separate ongoing rulemaking process specific \nto athletics. Cf. Portland Cement Ass’n v. EPA, 665 F.3d 177, 187 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“an \nagency must have a similar obligation to acknowledge and account for a changed regulatory \nposture the agency creates—especially when the change impacts a contemporaneous and \nclosely related rulemaking”); Office of Commc’n of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, 707 \nF.2d 1413, 1441–42 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (finding it “seriously disturbing” and “almost beyond \nbelief” that an agency would take rulemaking action undercutting another “concurrent” \nrulemaking process). \n253.  Finally, the Department repeatedly failed to adequately consider the effects \nof its terms on the States and their reliance interests of over 50 years of Title IX and its \nregulations. When commentators raised concerns about preemption, Defendants expressly \n“decline[d] to opine on how [the Final Rule] interacts or conflicts with any specific State \nlaws because it would require a fact-specific analysis,” and instead “refer[red] the public \nto § 106.6(b), which affirms that a [school’s] obligation to comply with Title IX and the \nregulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,822. \n62 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 63 of 66   PageID 139\nThis does not satisfy Defendants’ obligation to “adequately assess reliance interests” or \n“reasonably consider[] the relevant issues and reasonably explain[] the decision.” Texas v. \nBiden, 10 F.4th 538, 552, 555 (5th Cir. 2021). \nCount IV \nDeclaratory Judgment \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n254.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all other paragraphs. \n255.  “In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction … any court of the \nUnited States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n256.  This case presents an actual controversy because the Final Rule directly \nregulates the States as recipients of Title IX funds. Enforcement of the Final Rule would \nforce recipients to violate State laws and alter school facilities and policies, or otherwise \nrisk losing billions of dollars of education funds they depend on. \n257.  This Amended Complaint is an appropriate pleading, and this Court has \njurisdiction over this case.  And the Court can resolve the controversy over the legality of \nthe Final Rule by declaring that Title IX does not authorize the mandates of the Final Rule. \nVII.  Demand for Relief \nThis Court is authorized to award the requested vacatur and declaratory and \ninjunctive relief under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, and 706; 28 U.S.C. § 1361; the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202; Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 \nand 65; and the general and legal equitable powers of the Court. For these reasons, Texas \nrespectfully requests that the Court: \ni.  Postpone the effective date of (i.e., stay) the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705 \nand hold unlawful and set aside (i.e., vacate) the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2); \n63 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 64 of 66   PageID 140\nii.  Enter a judgment declaring that (1) the Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds \nthe agency’s statutory authority; (2) the Final Rule was not a result of reasoned \ndecisionmaking but is instead arbitrary and capricious; (3) the Final Rule is \ncontrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity; and (4) the \nState of Texas, including all of Texas’s instrumentalities, agencies, and political \nsubdivisions, may continue to receive Title IX funding notwithstanding any \nfailure to adhere to the Final Rule’s unlawful requirements;  \niii.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from \ninterpreting or enforcing Title IX as barring discrimination based on sexual \norientation  or  gender  identity—including  by  denying  federal  financial \nassistance or by otherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, \nassessments, investigations, or other enforcement actions—against the State of \nTexas,  including  all  of  Texas’s  instrumentalities,  agencies,  and  political \nsubdivisions; \niv.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from \ninterpreting, enforcing, or relying on any portion of the Final Rule that violates \nTitle IX, the APA, or the federal Constitution—including by denying federal \nfinancial  assistance  or  by  otherwise  pursuing,  charging,  or  assessing  any \npenalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or other enforcement actions—\nagainst the State of Texas, including all of Texas’s instrumentalities, agencies, \nand political subdivisions; \nv.  Award such other relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \n \n64 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 12   Filed 05/13/24    Page 65 of 66   PageID 141\nDated: May 13, 2024.

Based on the reasons discussed infra, \nit is GRANTED IN PART. Pending final resolution of this case, Defendants are hereby \nENJOINED from implementing, enacting, enforcing, or taking any action in any manner to \nenforce the Final Rule, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities  Receiving  Federal  Financial  Assistance,  89  Fed.  Reg.  33,474  (Apr.  29,  2024)        \n(“Final Rule”), which is scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2024. This preliminary injunction \nis limited to Plaintiffs Daniel A. Bonevac, John Hatfield, and the State of Texas. \n  SUMMARY \nThe Final Rule inverts the text, history, and tradition of Title IX: the statute protects women \nin spaces historically reserved to men; the Final Rule inserts men into spaces reserved to women. \nDefendants invoke Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020) to rationalize the Final Rule’s \ninversion of the statutory text but do not adequately explain why that Title VII employment case \ncontrols this Title IX education case, which instead implicates women’s athletics, safety, and sex-\nspecific facilities in a different setting: schools, colleges, and universities. \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 2 of 32   PageID 816\n  BACKGROUND \nI.  Title IX promotes opportunities for women.1  \n \n  Title IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972, forbids education programs or \nactivities  receiving  federal  financial  assistance  from  discriminating  “on  the  basis  of  sex.”              \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Before its enactment, nearly thirty-four percent of working women lacked \nhigh school diplomas and only seven percent of high school varsity athletes were women. \nRoughly fifty years later, only six percent of working women lack high school diplomas and \nforty-three percent of high school varsity athletes are women.2 In short, Title IX is succeeding: \nwomen and girls across America now benefit from opportunities to pursue advanced education, \nattend college, and develop athletic skills.  \n  That  is  because  Title  IX  recognizes  the  “enduring”  differences  “between  men  and \nwomen.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). For example, Title IX exempts \ntraditional single-sex institutions and programs like “fraternities or sororities”; “Boy or Girl \nconferences”; “Father-son or mother-daughter activities”; and “‘beauty’ pageants” from its \nrequirements. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)–(9). Congress, in other words, peppered Title IX with \nexplicit references to the biological and binary categories of two sexes with repeated references \nto “one sex” and “both sexes.” 118 CONG. REC. 5,807 (1972) (Sen. Bayh). As such, it does not \n“require[] integration of dormitories between the sexes” or mandate co-ed locker rooms or \nfootball teams. 117 CONG. REC. 30,407 (1971) (Sen. Bayh).3  \n \n1 I.e., biological women. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655 (“[F]or argument’s sake, we proceed on the assumption that \n‘sex’ signifie[s] . . . only . . . biological distinctions between male and female.”).  \n \n2 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, TED, https://perma.cc/EH4F-2CYD; 50 Years of Title IX, WSF (May 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/TN72-PJ4S. \n \n3 Here, legislative history is evidence of contemporaneous public meaning — not a search for legislative “intent.” Cf. \nANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 394 (2012). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 3 of 32   PageID 817\n  The first Title IX regulations further codified the “enduring” differences between men \nand  women.  In  1975,  the  Department  of  Education’s  (“Department”  or  “government”) \npredecessor promulgated regulations that “required” a school “to provide separate teams for men \nand women in situations where the provision of only one team would not ‘accommodate the \ninterests and abilities of members of both sexes.’” Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex,             \n40  Fed.  Reg.  24,128,  24,134  (June  4,  1975)  (codified  at  34  C.F.R.  §  106.41(c)(1)).                      \nTexas recipients relied on this understanding for fifty years, investing billions of dollars to extend \nequal educational and athletic opportunities to women.  \nII.  The Final Rule relies on untenable readings of Title IX.  \n  The Department now upends a half-century of reliance interests through its newest \nregulation, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  \n  First, the Final Rule reads sexual orientation and gender identity into Title IX’s anti-\ndiscrimination  principle  in  violation  of  that  statute  and  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act \n(“APA”). It provides that “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity.” Id. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). The Department \nexplains  that  “discrimination  on  each  of  those  bases  is  sex  discrimination  because  each \nnecessarily involves consideration of a person’s sex, even if that term is understood to mean only \nphysiological  or  ‘biological  distinctions  between  male  and  female.’”  Id.  at  33,802                 \n(quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655). The Final Rule also understands “sex discrimination” to be \n“any discrimination that depends” even “in part on consideration of a person’s sex.” Id. at 33,803.  \n  Now, Texas recipients cannot employ sex-based distinctions to deny “a transgender \nstudent access to a sex-separate facility or activity consistent with that student’s gender identity.” \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 4 of 32   PageID 818\nId. at 33,818. And any policy or practice that “prevents a person from participating in an \neducation program or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity” causes more than de \nminimis harm and is prohibited absent a statutory or regulatory exception. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818. \n  Second, the Final Rule imposes a “hostile environment harassment” rule that will likely \nchill student and professor speech on recipient campuses. Said harassment covers:  \n[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is \nsubjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity . . . . Whether a hostile environment has been created is a fact-\nspecific inquiry that includes consideration of [five separate factors].  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). The “subjective[],” ambiguous, and \n“fact-specific” nature of these inquiries likely chill campus speech.  \n  Third, the Final Rule requires Plaintiffs to cover abortions in their student health insurance \nplans. The Final Rule specifically requires Texas recipients to:  \ntreat pregnancy or related conditions in the same manner and under the same \npolicies as any other temporary medical conditions with respect to any medical or \nhospital benefit, service, plan, or policy the recipient administers, operates, offers, \nor participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,888 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(4)); see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,883 \n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2) (“pregnancy or related conditions” include “termination of \npregnancy”). This regulation implicates Texas’s sovereign interests in enforcing its duly enacted \nlaws, which prohibit exactly this conduct. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 171.208(a)(2) \n(imposing civil liability on anyone who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the \nperformance of inducement of an abortion, including paying for or reimbursing the costs of an \nabortion through insurance or otherwise . . . .”) (emphasis added).  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 5 of 32   PageID 819\n  Fourth, the Final Rule eviscerates procedural safeguards for the Title IX grievance \nprocess. In sum and substance, it requires the use of a single-investigator model (34 C.F.R.                             \n§  106.45(b)(2));  barriers  to  the  accused  for  accessing  relevant  evidence  (34  C.F.R.                               \n§ 106.45(f)(4)(i)); and unfair limits on live hearing procedures for postsecondary institutions     \n(34 C.F.R. § 106.46(g)). \nIII.  Texas must either comply or adopt policies violating State law.  \n \n  The State of Texas “administers numerous education programs and operates thousands of \neducational institutions through its constituent agencies and political subdivisions, including \nprograms and institutions that receive federal funding and are subject to Title IX and its \neffectuating regulations.” ECF No. 16 at 48. The Texas Education Agency (“TEA”) manages \nsome education programs directly, like the Texas School for the Deaf, whose dormitories, athletic \nteams, and locker rooms are separated by biological sex. ECF No. 16-1 at 7. Others it manages \nindirectly, like Texas’s six public university systems which “invested an entire infrastructure to \nimplement its education systems” on the basis of sex-based distinctions. ECF No. 16 at 51.  \n  Indeed,  Texas  law  protects  sex  separation  in  K–12  and  higher  education  athletic \nprograms. See TEX. EDUC. CODE § 33.0834 (“[A]n interscholastic athletic competition team \nsponsored or authorized by a school district or open-enrollment charter school may not allow         \n. . . a student to compete in an interscholastic athletic competition . . . that is designated for the \nbiological sex opposite to the student’s biological sex.”). Political subdivisions extend this \nbiological-sex mandate into intimate facilities. For example, the Carroll, Frisco, and Grapevine–\nColleyville Independent School Districts require schools owned or operated by the districts to \nseparate bathrooms, locker rooms, shower rooms, and other similar facilities based on biological \nsex (1) determined at birth and (2) correctly identified on a person’s birth certificate. ECF No. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 6 of 32   PageID 820\n16-1 at 21, 23, 30. Other school districts prohibit district employees from applying pronouns \ninconsistent with the student’s biological sex. Id. at 22, 24–29  \n  Under Texas law, the TEA oversees Title IX compliance within the State. ECF No. 16 at \n49. “As part of its mandate, TEA allocates the majority of federal funding for Texas K–12 \neducation.” Id. Texas received nearly $6.6 billion in federal funding for K–12 education for \n2021–2022.4 For fiscal year 2023, the TEA distributed roughly $9.4 billion in federal funding \nand an additional $4.8 billion in federal disbursements. ECF No. 16-1 at 4.  \n  In summary, the State of Texas and its political subdivisions are on a collision course with \nthe Final Rule. Texas can either (1) comply and violate State law, local policy, and many of its \nemployees’ rights of conscience or (2) reject the Final Rule and lose billions in federal funding \nfor its K–12 and higher-education systems.   \n  LEGAL STANDARD \n“The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the \nparties until a trial on the merits[.]” Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).                       \nPlaintiffs must demonstrate (1) a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits; (2) a substantial \nthreat of irreparable injury; (3) that the threatened  injury outweighs any harm that will result to \nthe non-movant if the injunction is granted; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public \ninterest. Robinson v. Ardoin, 86 F.4th 574, 587 (5th Cir. 2023); Air Prod. & Chemicals, Inc. v. \nGen. Servs. Admin., No. 2:23-CV-147-Z, 2023 WL 7272115, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 2, 2023).  \nThe first two factors are most critical, and the latter two merge when the government is an \nopposing party. Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 801 (5th Cir. 2020); Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n \n4  Tex.  Educ.  Agency,  2022  Comprehensive  Biennial  Report  on  Texas  Public  Schools  at  239  (Dec.  2020), \nhttps://tea.texas.gov/reports-and-data/school-performance/accountability-research/comp-annual-biennial-2022.pdf. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 7 of 32   PageID 821\n418, 435 (2009). That said, no factor has a “fixed quantitative value.” Mock v. Garland, 75 F.4th \n563, 587 (5th Cir. 2023). On the contrary, “a sliding scale is utilized, which takes into account the \nintensity of each in a given calculus.” Id. In sum, “[t]he decision to grant or deny a preliminary \ninjunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court[.]” White v. Carlucci, 862 F.2d        \n1209, 1211 (5th Cir. 1989).  \nANALYSIS \nI.  Plaintiffs are substantially likely to prevail on the merits. \n  The likelihood of success on the merits “is arguably the most important” factor for \npreliminary relief. Career Colleges & Sch. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th  220, 233    \n(5th Cir. 2024) (citations omitted); accord Mock, 75 F.4th at 587 n.60. Here, Plaintiffs argue that \nthe Final Rule (1) violates Title IX’s prohibition against “sex” discrimination; (2) illegally \nredefines “sex-based harassment”; (3) illegally protects abortion; and  (4) illegally changes \nprocedural safeguards in the Title IX grievance process, thereby violating Title IX, the APA, and \nthe Constitution.  \n  The APA generally requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, . . . otherwise not in accordance with law,” or \n“in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C.                   \n§§ 706(2)(A), (C). This standard of review requires courts to assess only whether the Final Rule \nwas “based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of \njudgment.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). Those \nfactors include when an agency (1) has relied on factors Congress has not intended it to consider; \n(2) entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the regulatory problem; (3) justified its \nconduct counter to the evidence before it; or (4) reached a determination that “is so implausible . \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 8 of 32   PageID 822\n. . it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or . . . agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Once a court determines that the \ncontested agency action falls short of the APA’s substantive or procedural requirements, it “shall” \nset aside the unlawful agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); Data Mktg. P’ship, L.P. v. United States \nDep’t of Lab., 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th Cir. 2022).  \nA.  The anti-discrimination regulation violates Title IX and the APA. \n  The Final Rule interprets Title IX to provide that “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex \nincludes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at      \n34 C.F.R. § 106.10). The Department explains that “discrimination on each of those bases is sex \ndiscrimination because each necessarily involves consideration of a person’s sex, even if that \nterm is understood to mean only physiological or ‘biological distinctions between male and \nfemale.’” Id. at 33,802 (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655). Further, the Final Rule understands \n“sex discrimination” to be “any discrimination that depends” even “in part on consideration of a \nperson’s sex.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,803. \n1.  Title VII does not govern Title IX.  \n  The government interprets Title IX in light of Bostock — a Title VII case. ECF No. 41   \nat 17–24. That comparison begs the question whether Title VII caselaw governs Title IX.            \nThe government claims that “[t]he Supreme Court has long used the phrase ‘on the basis of’        \n[in Title IX] interchangeably with Title VII’s ‘because of’ language when discussing Title VII’s \ncausation standard, including in Bostock itself.” ECF No. 41 at 18 (citing Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n650; Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009); Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, \n551 U.S. 47, 63–64 & n.14 (2007); Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992); \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 9 of 32   PageID 823\nMeritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 63 (1986); Lowrey v. Texas A&M Univ. Sys.,  \n117 F.3d 242, 248 (5th Cir. 1997); Lakoski v. James, 66 F.3d 751, 756 & n.3 (5th Cir. 1995); \nWittmer v. Phillips 66 Co., 915 F.3d 328, 337 (5th Cir. 2019) (Ho, J., concurring)).  \n  However,  Bostock’s  but-for  causation  standard  dramatically  altered  Title  VII.                    \nSee Bostock, 590 U.S. at 688 (Alito, J., dissenting) (“The arrogance of [the majority’s] argument \nis breathtaking.”). Hence, it does not follow that these pre-Bostock cases would have made the \nsame comparison today.  \n  The government cites the opening line of one post-Bostock case to support its reading of \nTitle IX. ECF No. 41 at 22–23 (citing Braidwood Mgmt., Inc. v. EEOC, 70 F.4th 914, 918           \n(5th Cir. 2023)). That case provides that Bostock “determined that Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct  of  1964  forbids  employers  from  discriminating  against  homosexuals  and  transgender \npersons, holding that such discrimination is ‘on the basis of sex.’” EEOC, 70 F.4th at 918.            \nBut EEOC does not support the government’s reading here. First, the foregoing statement is dicta \nand not relevant to the Court’s holding. Second, EEOC misstated Bostock’s holding, which \ninterpreted “because of . . . sex” under Title VII. Third, EEOC was not a Title IX case. EEOC,  \nin other words, offers no guidance for this Court’s reading of Title IX.  \n2.  Bostock’s “but-for” causation does not apply to Title IX.  \n \n  Instead of pre-Bostock cases, “[w]e [should] start where we always do: with the text of \nthe statute.” Career Colleges, 98 F.4th at 240 (quoting Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 74 \n(2023)); accord ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION \nOF LEGAL TEXTS 69–92 (2012). Essential to the Court’s “job is to interpret the words consistent \nwith their ‘ordinary meaning’ . . . at the time Congress enacted the statute.” Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. \nUnited States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 (2018) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 10 of 32   PageID 824\nThat requires, inter alia, reading the statute in context and “not in isolation.” Sw. Airlines Co. v. \nSaxon, 596 U.S. 450, 455 (2022). “Other sources . . . include contemporaneous dictionaries, \nrelated statutes, and past statements of the Department.” Career Colleges, 98 F.4th at 240. \n  Title IX’s general provision on “sex” provides:  \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . . \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n  The government argues that the foregoing text demands consideration of gender identity \nand sexual orientation. ECF No. 41 at 18. Section 1681(a) is so clear, it says, that courts need not \nlook beyond the text to statutory context or ordinary public meaning. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n593 (because “the express terms of [Title VII] give us one answer and extratextual considerations \nsuggest another, it’s no contest. Only the written word is law, and all persons are entitled to its \nbenefit”); see also ECF No. 41 at 24 (“The Final Rule explains the application of Bostock’s \nreasoning in detail . . . .”); 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,805 (“The Department’s interpretation of Title IX \nflows from the statute’s ‘plain terms’ . . . .”). \n  Bostock concluded that Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination “because of . . . sex” \ncovers discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660. \nBecause “sex is necessarily a but-for cause” of transgender discrimination, “it is impossible”        \nto discriminate against transgender individuals “without discriminating against that individual \nbased on sex.” Id. at 660, 661. For example, if an employer “fires a transgender person who was \nidentified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female,” but “retains an otherwise \nidentical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a \nperson identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 11 of 32   PageID 825\nfemale at birth.” Id. at 660. So “the individual employee’s sex plays an unmistakable and \nimpermissible role in the discharge decision.” Id.  \n  The  foregoing  argument  “is  wrong”  in  the  Title  IX  context.  Id.  at  689                                \n(Alito, J., dissenting); see L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(explaining that Bostock’s “reasoning applies only to Title VII, as Bostock itself and . . .  \nsubsequent cases make clear”). It does not follow that because sexual orientation and gender \nidentity are related to biological sex that discrimination “because of” the former amounts to \ndiscrimination “on the basis of” the latter. But that is exactly what the Final Rule assumes.  \n  However,  neither  sexual  orientation  nor  gender  identity  are  logical  predicates  to \ndiscrimination “on the basis” of biological sex. “[I]t is quite possible,” for example, for a Title \nIX school “to discriminate on those grounds without taking the sex of an individual [student] into \naccount.” Id. at 690. It can have a policy that states: “No transgender students of either sex may \nparticipate on athletic teams of the opposite sex.” This policy discriminates, but not “on the basis \nof sex,” because it governs transgender students of either sex. Gender identity is the dispositive \nfactor — not biological sex. See id. (A school “can implement this policy without paying any \nattention to or even knowing the biological sex of gay, lesbian, and transgender” students.).  \n  This is fatal to the Final Rule. “[I]f a [Title IX school] discriminates against individual \n[students] without even knowing whether they are male or female, it is impossible to argue that \nthe [school] intentionally discriminated because of sex.” Id. at 691. That is because a Title IX \nschool cannot “intentionally discriminate on the basis of a characteristic of which [the school] \nhas no knowledge.” Id. And if that is true, sex discrimination does not reduce to gender-identity \ndiscrimination simply because a school might know the individual student’s sex. Sex is not the \ndispositive factor — gender identity is.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 12 of 32   PageID 826\n  Fair enough that “[m]any things are related to sex.” Id. at 694. But what matters for \npurposes of Title IX is whether it prohibits discrimination because of biological sex itself —    \n“not everything that is related to, based on, or defined with reference to, ‘sex.’” Id. Of course, \ntextualism considers not only the language itself, but also the statutory context and original public \nmeaning. See Wis. Cent. Ltd., 585 U.S. at 277 (explaining that the Court’s essential “job is to \ninterpret the words consistent with their ‘ordinary meaning’ . . . at the time Congress enacted the \nstatute”). But to the extent that the Court divorces the text from these relevant considerations, \nBostock’s but-for causation reading of Title VII fails on its own terms in the Title IX context.  \n3.  Title IX does not address gender identity or sexual orientation.  \n \n  Proper textualism — accounting for ordinary public meaning and statutory context — \nillustrates the chasm between Title IX and the Final Rule. Consider the words themselves.          \nThe term “sex,” as of 1972, bore no logical relationship to notions of “gender identity.” At that \ntime, “sex” meant only a person’s biological sex — male or female — which “is an immutable \ncharacteristic determined solely” at “birth.” Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) \n(Brennan, J.) (plurality op.). And “[r]eputable dictionary definitions of ‘sex’ from the time of \nTitle IX’s enactment” reinforce what the public understood in 1973: “when Congress prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education, it meant biological sex, i.e., [sic] discrimination \nbetween males and females.” Adams by & through Kasper Sch.

The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n  Once a court determines the contested agency action falls short of the APA’s substantive \nor procedural requirements, it “shall” set aside the unlawful agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 706.     \nHere, the Final Rule violates Section 706(2) because the government misapplied Title VII to \n \n6 Neither the Final Rule nor the parties address these statutory “exceptions,” but the Department’s reading would likely \nproduce a statutorily absurd result that violates several canons: Sections 1681(a)(6), (7)(B)(i), (8), and (9) expressly \nallow a women-centric sorority or pageant to exclude men while the Final Rule for Section 1681(a) requires such \norganizations to include men – if they identify as women. See, e.g., SCALIA & GARNER, supra note 3, at 63–65 \n(“Presumption  Against  Ineffectiveness”),  69-77  (“Ordinary  Meaning”);  78–92  (“Fixed  Meaning”),  174–79 \n(“Surplusage”), 180–88 (“Harmonious Reading”).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 15 of 32   PageID 829\nmisread Title IX. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,801–11 (explaining the Final Rule’s reliance on Bostock). \nWhatever can be said about Title VII, Title IX is different. First, the statutes use different words; \nregardless of how courts used to conflate them, Bostock unsettled those long-held assumptions. \nSecond, courts predicated those long-held assumptions on the ordinary public meaning of both \nTitle VII and Title IX. See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 704–720 (Alito, J., dissenting) (discussing the \nordinary public meaning of Title VII). And the ordinary public meaning of both statutes never \ngrouped sexual orientation or gender identity under the concept of sex-based discrimination. \nThird, and perhaps most importantly, Title IX’s function was — and is — to provide equality for \nwomen in education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1682 (mandating agencies to promulgate rules “consistent \nwith achievement of the objectives of [Title IX] . . . .”); see also Phillips, supra at 3 (“And read \nas a composite, the phrase had more semantic content than one could glean from separately \nanalyzing and then amalgamating its three parts (‘discriminate,’ ‘against,’ and ‘sex’).”). \nTitle IX protects women in spaces that were historically reserved to men. In stark contrast, \nthe  Final  Rule  inserts  men  into  the  very  Title  IX  spaces  statutorily  reserved  to  women. \nConsequently, Title IX differs from Title VII in both the forest and the trees under every granular \nand capacious canon of statutory construction. The Final Rule, in other words, attempts exactly \nthe kind of interpretation that “is so implausible . . . it could not be ascribed to a difference in \nview or . . . agency expertise.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. The Court therefore FINDS that it is \narbitrary and capricious. \nB.  The sex-based harassment rules likely violate the First Amendment. \n \n  Title  IX  provides  that  no  person  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  may  be  “subjected  to \ndiscrimination.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). The Final Rule imposes new regulations stating that “[s]ex-\nbased harassment . . . is a form of sex discrimination and means sexual harassment and other \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 16 of 32   PageID 830\nharassment on the basis of sex . . . .” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). \nUnder this scheme, “hostile environment harassment” covers the following:  \n[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is \nsubjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or \ndenies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity . . . Whether a hostile environment has been created is a fact-\nspecific inquiry that includes consideration of [five separate factors].  \n \nId. Plaintiffs argue that the foregoing regulations violate the First Amendment.  \n  The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \nfreedom of speech . . . .” U.S. CONST. amend. I. It specifically forbids chilled speech. See United \nStates v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 769–70 (2023) (clarifying that “[o]verbroad laws ‘may deter or \n“chill” constitutionally protected speech,’ and if would-be speakers remain silent, society will \nlose their contributions to the ‘marketplace of ideas’”) (quoting Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, \n119 (2003)). And “[n]arrow tailoring is crucial where First Amendment activity is chilled — even \nif  indirectly  —  ‘[b]ecause  First  Amendment  freedoms  need  breathing  space  to  survive.’”          \nAms. For Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 609 (2021) (quoting NAACP v. Button,       \n371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)).  \n  Plaintiffs are correct. The Department did not narrowly tailor the Final Rule and therefore \nchilled Plaintiffs’ speech. Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (identifying a regulation as \nimpermissibly  vague  if  it  “fails  to  provide  people  of  ordinary  intelligence  a  reasonable \nopportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits” or “if it authorizes or even encourages \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement”) (citing Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56–57 \n(1999)). For instance, the Department equivocates on whether “misgendering” fits within its                         \n“hostile  environment  harassment”  scheme.  While  “[m]any  commentators  .  .  .  believe  that \nmisgendering is one form of sex-based harassment,” the Final Rule is less clear. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 17 of 32   PageID 831\n33,516. It provides that “whether verbal conduct constitutes sex-based harassment is necessarily \nfact-specific.” Id. And Title IX coordinators must afford credence to an individual claimant’s \n“subjective” sense of “offensive[ness].” Id. at 33,884 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). \n  Plaintiffs are apprehensive about the reach of sex-based harassment under the Final Rule. \nDaniel A. Bonevac, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin, assumes that he \nshould use subjective gender terms to avoid discipline under the Final Rule. See ECF No. 16-1 at \n14 (assuming he should use the singular pronoun “they” and other “‘made-up’ pronouns”).            \nIn short: Texas recipients, students, and employees (like Plaintiffs) do not know, based on the \nFinal Rule, whether misgendering constitutes “hostile environment harassment.”  \n  Defendants do not contest that “misgendering” language is otherwise protected speech \nunder the First Amendment. Cf. Chaplinsky v. State of New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571–72 \n(1942) (explaining that there are “certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, \nthe prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional \nproblem”). The Court therefore FINDS that the Final Rule’s harassment regulations likely chill \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment speech.  \nC.  The Final Rule wrongfully requires Texas insurers to cover abortions.  \n  Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule wrongfully requires them to violate Texas abortion \nlaws. ECF No. 16 at 36–38. Title IX’s “Neutrality with respect to abortion” provision states:  \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or \npublic or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the \nuse of facilities, related to an abortion.  \n \nNothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any \nperson or individual because such person or individual is seeking or has received \nany benefit or service related to a legal abortion. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1688.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 18 of 32   PageID 832\nThe Department regulations implemented in 1975 prohibit discrimination on the basis of \n“termination of pregnancy.” Compare 40 Fed. Reg. 24,128 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 86.21(c)(2)) \n(prohibiting  discrimination  in  admissions  based  on  “termination  of  pregnancy  or  recovery \ntherefrom”), 86.57(b) (“A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment \nany employee or applicant for employment on the basis of . . . termination of pregnancy, or \nrecovery  therefrom.”)  (1975)  with  34  C.F.R.  §§  106.21(c)  (prohibiting  discrimination  in \nadmissions  based  on  “termination  of  pregnancy,  or  recovery  therefrom”),  106.40(b)(1) \n(prohibiting a recipient from discriminating “against any student, or exclud[ing] any student from \nits education program or activity” based on “termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom”), \n106.57(b) (recipients may not discriminate against or exclude a person from employment based \non “termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom”) (current).  \n  Defendants are correct that the foregoing provisions do not conflict with Title IX.            \nSee ECF No. 41 at 32 (“At most, the Rule [referring to the above] merely confirms these \nlongstanding protections . . . .”). Taken together, they ensure equal admissions and employment \nopportunities for women who have terminated their pregnancies. But Plaintiffs take no issue with \nthese provisions. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that “the Final Rule requires all healthcare plans offered \nby every educational institution to cover abortion on the same terms as ‘any other temporary \nmedical condition.’” ECF No. 16 at 37.  \n  The Final Rule defines “pregnancy or related conditions” to include “termination of \npregnancy,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,883 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2), requiring recipients to: \ntreat pregnancy or related conditions in the same manner and under the same \npolicies as any other temporary medical conditions with respect to any medical or \nhospital benefit, service, plan, or policy the recipient administers, operates, offers, \nor participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 19 of 32   PageID 833\nId. at 33,888 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(4)) (emphasis added). Because “termination \nof pregnancy” is a “pregnancy or related condition” that recipient plans now must cover, the Final \nRule requires Texas recipients to cover abortions for students who enroll in their medical plans.  \n  Meanwhile, Texas law regulates and prohibits abortion. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY \nCODE § 170A.002(a) (“A person may not knowingly perform, induce, or attempt an abortion.”); \nsee also id. § 171.208(2) (subjecting to civil liability anyone who “knowingly engages in conduct \nthat aids or abets the performance of inducement of an abortion, including paying for or \nreimbursing the costs of an abortion through insurance or otherwise”). Texas imposes both \ncriminal and civil penalties for violations of this law. Id. §§ 170A.004–.005; id. § 171.208(2); \nTEX. PENAL CODE §§ 12.32–.33.  \n  Defendants respond that (1) the Final Rule does not require Texas recipients to cover \nabortions through health insurance and (2) Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Final Rule \nanyways.  \n1.  The Final Rule requires recipient insurers to cover abortion.  \n  First, the Final Rule plainly requires Texas recipients to cover abortion through their \nstudent health insurance plans. Defendants cite the Final Rule, which states that “nothing in Title \nIX or these final regulations requires recipients to pay for abortions either directly or through \nhealth insurance.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,761 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1688) (prohibiting any Title IX \nconstruction that “require[s] or prohibit[s] any person, or public or private entity, to provide or \npay  for  any  benefit  or  service,  including  the  use  of  facilities,  related  to  an  abortion”).                     \nThe Department asserts that any contrary reading is “mistaken.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,760. Not so.  \n  The Department’s contradictory statements cannot both be true. On the one hand, it \nexplicitly requires Texas recipients to cover abortions in their student health insurance plans.      \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 20 of 32   PageID 834\n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,888 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(4)). On the other, it disclaims this \nprovision and states that it would violate Title IX. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,760–61. The latter \ndisclaimer is of little comfort when the Final Rule requires Texas recipients to cover abortions.  \n  In essence, the Department admits that its own provisions violate Title IX and contradict \nthe Final Rule. Id. Thus, the Final Rule’s abortion protections are arbitrary and capricious.          \nSee State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (labeling arbitrary and capricious a regulation that “is so \nimplausible . . . it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or . . . agency expertise”).  \n2.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the abortion regulations.  \n  Second, Defendants argue that a Texas student seeking medical coverage for an abortion \n“relies on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities,” ECF No. 41 at 34 (quoting Clapper v. \nAmnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013)), including the assumption “that individuals will \nengage in illegal conduct,” ECF No. 41 at 34 (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 \n(1974)). As such, they conclude that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the termination-of-\npregnancy regulations.  \n  To establish standing, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered or will imminently suffer \nan “injury in fact” that was “caused” by the challenged government action that a favorable \ndecision would likely “redress.” Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–62 (1992).             \nTo satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement, a plaintiff must allege an invasion of a “legally protected \ninterest”  that  is  “concrete,”  “particularized,”  and  “actual  or  imminent.”  Id.  at  560                 \n(citations omitted). “[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.” Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, \n554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996)). “Rather, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief \nthat is sought.” Davis, 554 U.S. at 734 (internal marks omitted).  \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 21 of 32   PageID 835\n  The Final Rule expressly requires Texas recipients to cover abortions in their student \nhealth insurance plans, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,888 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(4)), but \nTexas law prohibits that exact conduct. Under the Health and Safety Code, the following are \nsubject to civil liability: \n[anyone who] knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance of \ninducement of an abortion, including paying for or reimbursing the costs of an \nabortion through insurance or otherwise, if the abortion is performed or induced in \nviolation of this subchapter, regardless of whether the person knew or should have \nknown that the abortion would be performed  or induced in violation of this \nsubchapter. \n \nTEX.  HEALTH  &  SAFETY  CODE  §  171.208(a)(2)  (emphasis  added);  see  id.  §  245.002            \n(defining “abortion”). Thus, any Texas recipient who complies with the Final Rule must violate \nTexas law. \n  That violation infringes upon Texas’s sovereign interest in enforcing its duly enacted \nlaws.  See  Cameron  v.  EMW  Women’s  Surgical  Ctr.,  P.S.C.,  595  U.S.  267,  277  (2022)   \n(describing  this  power  as  “[p]aramount  among  the  States’  retained  sovereign  powers”).           \nStates may have standing “based on (1) federal assertions of authority to regulate matters they \nbelieve they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal interference with the \nenforcement of state law . . . .” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 (5th Cir. 2015).  \n  Each condition obtains here: Texas law subjects insurance providers to civil liability for \nabortion coverage and the Final Rule requires Texas recipients to subject themselves to this \nliability. These conditions create an obvious conflict between the enforcement of federal and state \nlaw. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.8) (declaring that the Final \nRule preempts state law). Based on Plaintiffs’ standing and the foregoing analysis, the Court \nFINDS that these regulations are arbitrary and capricious.   \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 22 of 32   PageID 836\nD.  Some grievance procedures are arbitrary and capricious.  \n  Plaintiffs challenge the Final Rule’s update in procedural safeguards for the Title IX \ngrievance process. ECF No. 16 at 39–47. They specifically challenge provisions concerning use \nof a single-investigator model (34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(2)); initiation of a complaint by the Title \nIX Coordinator (34 C.F.R. § 106.44(f)(1)(v)); the manner in which a recipient may allow parties \nto a complaint to access the relevant evidence (34 C.F.R. § 106.45(f)(4)(i)); live hearing \nprocedures for postsecondary institutions (34 C.F.R. § 106.46(g)); and the recipient’s options for \nthe standard of proof to be applied in proceedings (34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)). Defendants respond \n(1) that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the grievance procedures and (2) that the Final Rule’s \nchanges are not arbitrary and capricious. ECF No. 41 at 42–52. \n1.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the grievance procedures.  \n  “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each \nform of relief that is sought.” Davis, 554 U.S. at 734 (internal marks omitted). Here, the \ngovernment argues that the State of Texas lacks standing because individual schools can choose \nto implement policies the State deems acceptable. ECF No. 41 at 44.  \n  This  mischaracterizes  Texas’s  standing  injury.  Properly  understood,  “[i]f  recipients \ncomply with the Department’s new regulations, they risk civil rights lawsuits and litigation \nexpenses.” ECF No. 16 at 41. But “[i]f they side with the constitutional rights of their students \nand employees, they invite federal or private enforcement actions, jeopardizing not only their \nreputation but their access to federal funds.” Id.  \n  The government responds that Texas impermissibly speculates about potential future \nlawsuits. ECF No. 41 at 45 (citing Sullo & Bobbitt P.L.L.C. v. Abbott, 536 F. App’x 473, 477       \n(5th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (stating that a plaintiff’s alleged injury of being “subject to potential \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 23 of 32   PageID 837\nlawsuits with minimal chances of success” is “not certainly impending”)). But little speculation \nis necessary when prior Department initiatives with similar incentives “resulted in a record \nnumber  of  lawsuits  and  judgments  against  public  universities  .  .  .  .”  ECF  No.  16  at  42               \n(citing Jonathan Taylor, Milestone: 700+ Title IX/Due Process Lawsuits by Accused Students, \nTitle IX for All (May 11, 2021), https://titleixforall.com/milestone-700-title-ix-due-process-\nlawsuits-by-accused-students/); see also Brian A. Pappas, Procedural Convergence, 55 LAW & \nSOC’Y REV. 381, 391 (2021) (concluding that “[u]niversities faced a choice of what constituted \nthe larger risk: OCR enforcement or civil lawsuits?”).  \n2.  Some grievance procedures are arbitrary and capricious.  \n  The  Department’s  changes  must  be  “the  product  of  reasoned  decisionmaking.”              \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 52. Because the “new policy rests on factual findings that contradict those \nwhich underlay its prior policy,” the Department must “provide a more detailed justification.” \nFCC v. Fox Tele. Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  \na.  Single-Investigator Model \n  Accused  students  at  public  institutions  “must,  at  a  minimum,  receive  protections \nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Doe v. Brandeis Univ., \n177 F. Supp. 3d 561, 602 (D. Mass. 2016) (citing Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574–85 (1975)). \nFor the first time, the Department provided “schools the option of using a single-investigator \nmodel.” ECF No. 41 at 46 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,660–64). The Department explains that \n“requiring separate staff members to handle investigations and adjudication is burdensome for \nsome recipients in a way that undermines their ability to ensure their education programs or \nactivities  are  free  from  sex  discrimination  under  Title  IX.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,662.                         \nAnd “permitting, but not requiring, the single-investigator model . . . in conjunction with the other \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 24 of 32   PageID 838\nmeasures designed to ensure equitable treatment of the parties . . . offer[s] recipients reasonable \noptions to structure their grievance procedures in compliance with Title IX . . . .” Id.  \n  The Court is not persuaded. Other courts have already explained that the “dangers of \ncombining in a single individual the power to investigate, prosecute, and convict, with little \neffective power of review, are obvious.” Brandeis, 177 F. Supp. 3d at 606. Not to the Department, \napparently. But “[n]o matter how well-intentioned, such a person may have preconceptions and \nbiases, may make mistakes, and may reach premature conclusions.” Id. Indeed, vesting one \nindividual with such power in criminal proceedings violates due process. See In re Oliver,          \n333 U.S. 257, 278–79 (1948) (Rutledge, J., concurring) (noting that a one-man grand jury     \n“takes away the security against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense and denies the \nequal protection of the laws by leaving to the committing functionary’s sole discretion the scope \nand contents of the record on appeal”).  \n  It does not matter that each recipient is “permit[ed], but not require[ed]” to adopt the \nsingle-investigator model. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,662. That is because the single-investigator model \nitself  lacks  justification  and  therefore  cannot  be  considered  a  product  of  reasoned \ndecisionmaking. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 52; Fox, 556 U.S. at 515. Permitting — not requiring \n— the model is the problem that the Department has failed to justify.  \nb.  Access to Evidence \n  The Final Rule provides: “A recipient must provide an equal opportunity to access either \nthe  relevant  and  not  otherwise  impermissible  evidence,  or  an  accurate  description  of  this \nevidence.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,892 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(f)(4)(i)). In the latter \ncase, a school “must further provide the parties with an equal opportunity to access the relevant \nand not otherwise impermissible evidence upon request of any party.” Id.; see id. at 33,682           \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 25 of 32   PageID 839\n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(c)(1)(iv)) (notice of the right).  \n  Thus, a student accused of a Title IX violation might face circumstances where he can \naccess only an “accurate description” of the evidence against him. The Department justifies this \nchange because “the description option may be more appropriate for complaints involving \nyounger students and individuals facing less severe consequences, allowing the recipient to \nstreamline the investigation process while ensuring that the parties have a meaningful opportunity \nto be heard.” Id. at 33,695. The Final Rule notably does not explain what constitutes “less severe \nconsequences.” Individual recipients presumably make this ad hoc determination.  \n  “When a right is protected by the Due Process Clause, a state ‘may not withdraw [it] on \nthe grounds of misconduct absent[] fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the \nmisconduct occurred.” Doe v. Purdue University, 928 F.3d 652, 663 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.) \n(quoting Goss, 419 U.S. at 574). In Doe, then-Judge Barrett held that Purdue University violated \na student’s due process rights when it “did not disclose its evidence” to him. Doe, 928 F.3d at \n663.  She  explained  that  “withholding  the  evidence  on  which  it  relied  in  adjudicating                      \n[the  student’s]  guilt  was  itself  sufficient  to  render  the  process  fundamentally  unfair.”  Id.    \n(quoting Goss, 419 U.S. at 580 (stating that “fairness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided \ndetermination of facts decisive of rights”)).  \n  The Final Rule is too ambiguous and discretionary to satisfy due process. First, it allows \nindividual recipients to choose whether a student can access the evidence or only an accurate \ndescription. Second, individual recipients get to decide what’s “relevant” evidence and what isn’t.                 \nThat ambiguity invites abuse. Third, if a recipient does provide an “accurate description” of the \nevidence (whatever that is), it must provide “an equal opportunity to access” relevant evidence. \nThe Supreme Court’s due process jurisprudence demands more — that the student actually access \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 26 of 32   PageID 840\nthe evidence. The Final Rule imposes unfair barriers between students and their due process \nrights. This provision lacks rational justification and is therefore arbitrary and capricious.  \nc.  Live Hearings and Questioning \n  The Final Rule “will allow schools to decide whether to provide live questioning through \na live hearing or through separate meetings with the parties.” ECF No. 41 at 50; 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,894–95 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.46(f)). The Department justifies stripping the \naccused of his right to confront live witnesses because “nothing . . . precludes a postsecondary \ninstitution from choosing to use a live hearing with questioning by an advisor, either because it \nis required under applicable Federal or State case law or for any other reason.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,737.  \n  The Department contradicts its prior 2020 Rule, which upheld the importance of live cross \nexamination.  See,  e.g.,  Nondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026, 33,331 (“requir[ing] a \nrecipient to step into the shoes of an advocate by asking each party cross-examination questions \ndesigned to challenge that party’s plausibility, credibility, reliability, motives, and consistency” \nwould place the recipient in the “untenable position of acting partially (rather than impartially) \ntoward the parties, or else failing to probe the parties’ statements for flaws the reflect on the \nveracity of the party’s statements”).  \n  The Department argues that this contradiction is reasonable because individual recipients \ncan still utilize live cross examination. ECF No. 41 at 49–51. But it does not explain how this \nproposal safeguards the accused’s right to challenge the accuser’s credibility. In short, the Final \nRule did not justify its “findings that contradict” the 2020 Rule. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515.  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 27 of 32   PageID 841\nd.  Standard of Proof \n  The Final Rule permits recipients to utilize the preponderance of the evidence standard of \nproof for the following purposes: \nto determine whether sex discrimination occurred, unless the recipient uses the \nclear  and  convincing  evidence  standard  of  proof  in  all  other  comparable \nproceedings, including proceedings relating to other discrimination complaints, in \nwhich case the recipient may elect to use that standard of proof in determining \nwhether sex discrimination occurred.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,893 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(1)). While some Fifth Circuit \njudges  understandably  disapprove  of  the  preponderance  standard  in  the  Title  IX  context,       \nPlummer v. University of Houston, 860 F.3d 767, 782 n.11 (5th Cir. 2017) (Jones, J., dissenting), \nno majority has disallowed it. And the Final Rule correctly states that many other courts approve. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. 33,701 (citing cases). Applying the preponderance standard here cannot be said \nto be so unreasonable as to be arbitrary and capricious.  \ne.  Initiation of Complaint \n  A Title IX coordinator may consider “eight non-exhaustive factors” in determining \nwhether specific facts warrant an investigation in the absence of a complaint. ECF No. 41 at 48 \n(citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(f)(1)(v)(A)(1)–(8))). On these \nbases, the Department admits that “a school may initiate a complaint based on an oral complaint \nor, under extraordinary circumstances, no complaint at all.” ECF No. 41 at 48.  \n  Plaintiffs argue that the foregoing “allow[s] an investigation to begin without any formal \nwritten complaint,” which “empowers Title IX coordinators to go beyond their mandatory \nreporting duties and to police activities on campus that they think constitute sex discrimination.” \nECF No. 16 at 45. This is arbitrary and capricious, per Plaintiffs, because the Department “failed \nto reasonably address the extraordinary implications of these changes . . . .” Id.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 28 of 32   PageID 842\n  Not so. As the Department explains, “the Rule and its eight non-exhaustive factors \nprovide more clarity than the 2020 Amendments about the circumstances in which a Title IX \nCoordinator should initiate the grievance process, which is one reason the Department decided \nto make this change.” ECF No. 41 at 48 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,594). Plaintiffs may disfavor \nthis change, but the Department reasonably addressed these concerns and erected safeguards \nregarding when a complaint may be brought. This specific rule is not arbitrary and capricious.  \nII.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury without injunctive relief. \n  “To show irreparable injury if threatened action is not enjoined, it is not necessary to \ndemonstrate that the harm is inevitable and irreparable.” Humana, Inc. v. Avram A. Jacobson, \nM.D., P.A., 804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986). Instead, a plaintiff “need show only a significant \nthreat of injury from the impending action, that the injury is imminent, and that money damages \nwould not fully repair the harm.” Id.  \n  Plaintiffs allege irreparable injury based on (1) compliance costs and (2) loss of federal \nfunding. ECF No. 16 at 48–52. Defendants summarily respond that these alleged injuries are \n“speculat[ive],” rest on “unfounded fears,” and are neither “realistic” nor “imminent.” ECF No. \n41 at 55–56 (internal marks and citations omitted).  \n  Defendants are mistaken because at least one of these injuries must occur. On the one \nhand, Plaintiffs insist that they will not comply with the Final Rule. See ECF No. 16 at 52 \n(“Because Texas has and allows policies that conflict with the Final Rule, it and its components \nface Title IX funding losses should the Final Rule remain in place.”); see also Letter from Greg \nAbbott, Governor of Texas, to Chairman and Regents of the University of Texas (May 8, 2024) \n(on file at https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Texas_Regents_Title_IX.pdf) (“As I have \nalready made clear, Texas will not comply with President Joe Biden’s rewrite of Title IX . . .         \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 29 of 32   PageID 843\nI instructed the Texas Education Agency to ignore President Biden’s illegal dictate of Title IX. \nToday, I am instructing every public college and university in the State of Texas to do the same.”); \ncf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,542 (stating that the Final Rule displaces contrary state and recipient laws \nand policies). That would trigger the Final Rule’s disciplinary provisions that will strip Texas \nrecipients of federal funding. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (conditions on federal financial assistance).  \n  Loss of federal funding would devastate the State of Texas. In the 2021–2022 biennium, \nTexas received roughly $6.6 billion in federal funds for K–12 education. ECF No. 16 at 49.           \nIn 2022, Texas postsecondary educational institutions received roughly $2.5 billion in federal \nfunding; public universities received $3.8 billion; community colleges received $2.1 billion; \ntechnical educational institutions received over $100 million; and health-related educational \ninstitutions received more than $1.5 billion. Id. at 50–51. In fiscal year 2023, Texas public schools \nreceived roughly $9.4 billion in federal funding distributed by the TEA and an additional $4.8 \nbillion in federal disbursements. Id. at 49. The government plans to enforce the Final Rule and \nTexas refuses to follow it.  \n  The foregoing — billions of dollars per year — will likely cripple “the State’s entire \nhigher  education  network  [which]  includes  148  public  institutions  and  currently  enrolls \napproximately 1.4 million students.” Id. at 50. For example, “[i]nstitutions that lose their federal \nfunding will need to eliminate certain educational services if they cannot find alternative funding \nsources.” Id. (citing ECF No. 16-1 at 5, 7–8, 10). To continue operations in accordance with its \nintention to ignore the Final Rule, Texas would need at least $13 billion per year to cover its \nlosses in federal funding. “Irreparable injury” here is an understatement — not hyperbole.  \n  On the other hand, Plaintiffs can expect irreparable compliance costs if they follow the \nFinal Rule. See Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (“complying with a regulation \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 30 of 32   PageID 844\nlater held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \ncosts”) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220–21 (1994) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in part and in the judgment)). A Plaintiff “need not convert each allegation of harm \ninto a specific dollar amount.” Career Colleges, 98 F.4th at 236 (internal marks omitted). And \n“alleged compliance costs need only be more than de minimis.” Id. (internal marks omitted). \n  The  Department  acknowledges  that  recipients  must  “updat[e]  policies  or  training \nmaterials” and host trainings for employees and Title IX coordinators. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,867, \n33,876 (discussing 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). These updates and training sessions necessitate \n“substantial expense” and “other compliance-related costs.” ECF No. 16 at 48 (citing 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,867, 33,876). Plaintiffs’ efforts here must “involve but [would] not [be] exhausted by \nhiring staff to perform compliance reviews, facilitate the Title IX grievance process, and respond \nto lawsuits that stem from allegations of liability under Title IX protections.” ECF No. 16 at 52 \n(citing ECF No. 16-1 at 11–12). These costs “will likely increase when the Department adopts \nnew  regulations  that  create  additional  requirements  or  make  existing  requirements  more \ndemanding.”  Id.  Overall,  “the  Department  estimates  more  than  $98  million  in  short-term \ncompliance costs, some of which will fall on Texas schools.” Id. (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,861). \n  But “[a]t most,” per the government, “these generic statements state the obvious: a new \nregulation will likely require regulated parties to undertake some activities to assure compliance.” \nECF No. 41 at 56. Where a regulation is otherwise valid, the government has a point. But not \nhere, because the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious on the numerous grounds explained supra. \nHence, Plaintiffs would likely have to “comply[] with a regulation later held invalid.” EPA,       \n829  F.3d  at  433.  Such  compliance  “almost  always  produces  the  irreparable  harm  of \nnonrecoverable compliance costs.” Id.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 31 of 32   PageID 845\n  Irreparable harm is almost always the case because Plaintiffs would suffer a double-\ncompliance cost. Because this Court finds that the Final Rule is likely arbitrary and capricious, \nthe Final Rule is likely to be held invalid. Thus, should the Court offer no relief at this juncture, \nand Plaintiffs did comply, they would overhaul their Title IX infrastructure on August 1, 2024. \nBut if the Final Rule is potentially held invalid, Texas would need to reverse course, which would \nlikely require equal if not greater compliance costs. Without relief, a compliant Texas would \nsuffer messaging dysfunction throughout its recipient institutions in addition to millions of \nwasted compliance dollars.  \n  In conclusion, Plaintiffs must suffer at least one form of irreparable injury. If they don’t \ncomply — they intend not to — they must produce at least $13 billion per year to uphold Texas’s \ncurrent education system. Or millions of Texas students suffer the consequences. If they do \ncomply, and the Final Rule is later held invalid, they suffer double compliance costs — likely \nmillions in total. Hence, Plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable injury at this stage.  \nIII.  The public interest and balance of equities favor Plaintiffs.  \n  The balance of equities and the public interest “merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. Likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm \nare the two most important factors in the analysis for preliminary relief. See Career Colleges,    \n98 F.4th at 239 (likelihood of success on the merits); Mock, 75 F.4th at 587 n.60 (same). \nDefendants thus “face[] a high hurdle” in establishing that the remaining two factors weigh \nagainst granting relief. Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th Cir. 2023).  \n  Granting a preliminary injunction here would ensure “that Texas may continue to enforce \nits laws and policies without risking the loss of Title IX funding.” ECF No. 16 at 57. And the \npublic interest would be served “by preventing the loss of federal funds to Texas’s educational \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00086-Z   Document 48   Filed 07/11/24    Page 32 of 32   PageID 846\ninstitutions.” Id.; see Career Colleges, 98 F.4th at 254–55 (“Evidence . . . shows that a failure to \nstay the Rule would significantly constrain schools’ operations and prevent them from devoting \nresources to educating their students, upgrading facilities, and constructing new ones . . . . Such \na consequence would harm the public at large.”). And “there is generally no public interest in the \nperpetuation of unlawful agency action.” Texas v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 560 (5th Cir. 2021) \n(internal marks omitted); BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 (5th Cir. 2021).   \n  CONCLUSION \n  Based on the foregoing review, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion IN PART. \nPending final resolution of this case, Defendants are therefore ENJOINED from implementing, \nenacting,  enforcing,  or  taking  any  action  in  any  manner  to  enforce  the  Final  Rule, \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024), which is scheduled to take effect on \nAugust 1, 2024. This preliminary injunction is limited to Plaintiffs Daniel A. Bonevac, John \nHatfield, and the State of Texas. \n  It is FURTHER ORDERED that no security is required to be posted by Texas or \nindividual Plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.   \n  SO ORDERED. \n  July 11, 2024 \n \nMATTHEW J. KACSMARYK \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n32 \n ",
