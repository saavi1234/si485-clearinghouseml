    "summary": "<p>In this case, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia challenged the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s regulation (the &ldquo;Rule&rdquo;) which interpreted Title IX&rsquo;s definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on gender identity, expanded the definition of harassment, and incorporated a de minimis harm standard for determining sex discrimination. The Rule went into effect on August 1, 2024, but has been enjoined from enforcement in several states due to this case and Louisiana v. Department of Education, a similar proceeding brought by Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and Idaho.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2024, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia filed suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky against Miguel Cardona in his capacity as the Secretary of Education and the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Plaintiffs brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2). They alleged that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the agency&rsquo;s statutory authority. They also alleged that the Rule was in violation of the APA because it was unconstitutional. They claimed the Rule was in excess of Congress&rsquo; power under the Spending Clause, violated the nondelegation doctrine, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and infringed on parents&rsquo; Constitutional right to raise their children as they see fit. The states sought declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>On May 8, 2024, Judge Danny C. Reeves granted a motion to intervene to plaintiffs the Christian Educators Association International, a religious organization comprised of educators, and A.C., a high school athlete in one of the affected states. The intervenor-plaintiffs were represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom. They filed an intervenor complaint, seconding the state plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations. In addition, they alleged that the Rule violated the APA due to federalism clear statement rules, the major questions doctrine, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff states filed a motion for a stay postponing the Rule&rsquo;s effective date of August 1, 2024 and a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the rule, on May 3, 2024. The intervenor-plaintiffs filed a similar motion on May 16, 2024. The court granted the preliminary injunction on June 17, 2024, enjoining the enforcement of the Rule in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia. The court found that the Rule conflicted with the plain language of Title IX in its definition of &ldquo;sex,&rdquo; that its definition of harassment conflicted with the First Amendment, and that the DOE&rsquo;s actions were arbitrary and capricious. 2024 WL 2019146.</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2024, the Government moved for a partial stay of the injunction pending appeal, arguing that the injunction was overbroad and that the Rule was severable, and appealed the preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The partial stay sought to allow all enforcement of the Rule except 34 C.F.R. &sect; 106.31(a)(2), which identified practices that prevent a person from participating in activities consistent with their gender identity as discrimination, and the definition of &ldquo;hostile environment harassment&rdquo; within 34 C.F.R. &sect; 106.2. The district court denied the partial stay on July 10, 2024. 2024 WL 3631032.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, on July 1, 2024, the Government requested an emergency partial stay on the same grounds from the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit denied the partial stay 2-1 on July 17, 2024. 2024 WL 3453880. The Government also requested an emergency partial stay of this preliminary injunction and a stay of a similar injunction in Louisiana v. Department of Education from the Supreme Court on July 22, 2024. The Supreme Court denied both stays on August 16, 2024. Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by Justices Gorsuch, Kagan, and Jackson, arguing that the Rule was severable and therefore the partial stay should be granted. 144 S.Ct. 2507.</p>\r\n<p>The state plaintiffs and intervenor plaintiffs filed separate motions for summary judgment on July 26, 2024. The Government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on August 23, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 9, 2025, the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and vacated the Rule. The court found that the Rule exceeded the DOE's authority because Title IX's language does not cover discrimination based on gender identity. Further, the court interpreted the Rule to mandate that teachers use names and pronouns associated with a student&rsquo;s gender identity, which it held violated the First Amendment because it compelled speech. The court also held that the Rule's definition of sex-based harassment violated the First Amendment because it was overbroad, and violated procedural due process because it was impermissibly vague. Additionally, the court held that the Rule violated the Spending Clause because it put conditions on federal funds without an unambiguous statutory command. Finally, the court held that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA, as the Department failed to provide a &ldquo;reasoned explanation&rdquo; for the shift in Title IX interpretation. 2025 WL 63795.</p>\r\n<p>As of February 11, 2025, the appeal of the preliminary injunction in the Sixth Circuit remains pending.</p>",

It attempted to remedy this historical inequity through the \npassage of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, commonly known as Title IX.  And for \nmore than fifty years, educational institutions across the country risk losing federal funding if \nthey fail to comply with the dictates of the statute.  \n  This case concerns an attempt by the executive branch to dramatically alter the purpose \nand meaning of Title IX through rulemaking.  But six states, an association of Christian \neducators,  and  one  fifteen-year-old  girl  object.    As  they  correctly  argue,  the  new  rule \ncontravenes the plain text of Title IX by redefining “sex” to include gender identity, violates \n \n1  The defendants made this concession during oral arguments on the plaintiffs’ motion \nfor injunctive relief.  The parties have agreed to little else.   \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 2 of 93 - Page ID#:\n1997\ngovernment employees’ First Amendment rights, and is the result of arbitrary and capricious \nrulemaking.  If the new rule is allowed to take effect on August 1, 2024, all plaintiffs will \nsuffer immediate and irreparable harm.  Because the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the \nmerits of their claims, and the public interest and equities highly favor their position, the new \nrule will be enjoined, and its application stayed. \nII. \nTitle IX’s Prohibition on Sex Discrimination \n  “The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of \none is different from a community composed of both.”  Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 504 n.12 \n(1972) (quoting Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193-94 (1946)).  The United States \nSupreme Court made this observation in 1972—the same year Indiana Senator Birch Bayh \nintroduced an amendment that would become Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.  See 118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (1972).  \n  Title IX was patterned largely after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides that \n“[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder  any  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance.”   42  U.S.C.  § \n2000d.  Momentum for passing federal legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of \nsex began building later in the 1960s as congressional attention turned to remedying the \ndisparate treatment of women in education and the workforce.  See Leslie Gladstone and Gary \nGalemore, Cong. Rsch. Serv. 97-954, Sex Discrimination In Education: Overview of Title IX \n(1998) (“Title IX grew out of the women’s civil rights movement of the late 1960s and early \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 3 of 93 - Page ID#:\n1998\n1970s.  In that period, Congress began to focus attention on systemic educational barriers to \nwomen and girls.”).  \n  In May 1970, Dr. Bernice Sandler of the Women’s Equity Action League testified \nbefore the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments concerning the discrimination \nwomen faced in colleges and universities, stating “[w]omen have been discriminated against \nin many areas of life, of which the university is but one.  We need to begin to redress these \nwrongs.”   The  Equal  Rights  Amendment:  Hearing  Before  the  S.  Subcomm.  on  Const. \nAmendments, 91st Cong. (1970).  Congress did just that by shifting focus to the problem of \nsex-based discrimination in education.  The House Special Subcommittee on Education, as \npart of the Committee on Education and Labor, held seven days of hearings on discrimination \nagainst  women  in  education  programs  receiving  federal  funding  and  employment  in \neducation.  Discrimination Against Women: Hearings on H.R. 16098 Before the H. Special \nSubcomm. on Educ. & Labor, 91st Cong. (1970).  Representative Edith Green of Oregon, the \nchair of the subcommittee, presided over the hearing for Section 805 of 91 H.R. 16098, which \nsought to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded programs and \neducation.  91st Cong. 1-2 (1970) (statement of Rep. Green). \n  The  testimony  before  the  subcommittee  identified  the  following  as  examples  of \ndifferential treatment between males and females:  \n•  Some publicly funded university undergraduate admissions policies did not allow for \nthe admission of women, imposed higher standards for admitting women, or imposed \nsex-based quotas; \n  \n•   Some academic programs and courses within publicly funded educational institutions, \nsuch as nursing schools, would not admit married women; \n \n•   Women generally were found to be less likely to receive financial aid and married \nwomen were often excluded from receiving any financial aid; \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 4 of 93 - Page ID#:\n1999\n \n•   Certain school-sponsored activities, such as honor societies, were reserved for male \nstudents only; \n \n•  Athletic programs for women were funded at significantly lower levels than those \nfor men; \n \n•  Women were frequently discouraged from applying to law and medical schools, as well \nas programs in the hard sciences, such as physics; and \n \n•  Women who sought employment at educational institutions with equivalent training \nand experience to men were hired at lower rates and with lower salaries and upward \nmobility potential for promotions compared to male counterparts. \n \nLeslie Gladstone and Gary Galemore, Cong. Rsch. Serv. 97-954, Sex Discrimination In \nEducation: Overview of Title IX (1998).  \n  The obvious takeaway is that females were disadvantaged compared to their male \ncounterparts.   In  agreement,  Representative  Green  observed  following  the  hearing  that \n“[m]any of us would like to think of educational institutions as being far from the maddening \ncrowd, where fair play is the rule of the game and everyone, including women, gets a fair roll \nof the dice.”  Discrimination Against Women: Hearings on H.R. 16098 Before the H. Special \nSubcomm. on Educ. & Labor, 91st Cong. (1970).  Although her proposed legislative remedy \nwas not included in the Education Amendments of 1971, these hearings were a major step \ntoward the eventual enactment of Title IX.  \n  A short time later, Representative Abner Mikva of Illinois introduced a similar bill to \nenshrine into law the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Women’s Rights and \nResponsibilities.  See 116 Cong. Rec. 22681–82 (statement of Rep. Mikva).  The bill sought \nto  eliminate  sex  discrimination  in  several  areas,  including  federally  assisted  programs, \ngovernment employment, employment in educational institutions, wages, and housing.

Rec. 22735 (1971) (statement of Sen. \nBayh).  On the Senate floor, he stated:  \nLet us ensure that no American will be denied access to higher education \nbecause of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.  The bill I am submitting \ntoday will guarantee that women, too, enjoy the educational opportunity every \nAmerican deserves. \n \nSee 117 Cong. Rec. 22735 (1971).   \n  The legislation stalled, but a report from the House Committee on Education and Labor \naccompanied a related proposal known as the Higher Education Act by the fall of 1971.  The \nHouse version included a specific provision, authored primarily by Representative Patsy Mink \nof Hawaii, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities \nreceiving federal funds.  See H.R. Rep. No. 92-554 (1971).  Members fiercely debated whether \nbroad coverage of the amendment was appropriate, citing the threat of intrusive government \noverreach  into  the  sensitive  decision-making  apparatuses  of  the  country’s  colleges  and \nuniversities.  117 Cong. Rec. 39248–63 (1971).  They argued that the federal government \nshould not remove private institutions’ control over admissions and recommended amending \nthe language to exempt university admissions and recruitment policies from being subject to \nquotas on the basis of sex.  Id.  To proceed, the committee ultimately adopted an amendment \nby  Representative  John  Neal  Erlenborn  of  Illinois  to  exempt  private  institutions’ \nundergraduate admissions policies from the sex-based discrimination provisions.  Id.  \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 6 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2001\n  A similar legislative exercise overflowed in the upper chamber the following year as \nSenator Bayh continued to stress that economic inequities suffered by women were traceable \nto educational inequities by emphasizing the link between discrimination in education and \nsubsequent employment opportunities.  Amid consideration of the House’s language to exempt \nprivate  undergraduate  admissions  policies  from  the  prohibition  of  sex  discrimination,  a \nperfecting amendment was adopted to likewise exempt the undergraduate admissions policies \nof public institutions that had historically been traditionally single sex.  See 118 Cong. Rec. \n5802-5815 (1972).  \n  After years of intense legislative debate premised on the fixed biological dichotomy \nbetween males and females, Congress eventually took an affirmative step toward eliminating \ndiscrimination based on sex in education.  In early 1972, Congress passed Title IX as part of a \nbroader bill expanding civil rights in education once a conference committee reconciled the \nHouse and Senate versions.  Senator Bayh referred to the legislation, known as the Education \nAmendments Act, as “[t]he only antidote” to “the continuation of corrosive and unjustified \ndiscrimination against women . . . in[] all facets of education.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5803 (1972) \n(statement of Sen. Bayh).   \n  President Richard Nixon signed the Education Amendments Act into law on June 23, \n1972.  As enacted, Title IX prevents discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs \nand opportunities that receive federal funding.  Title IX’s general prohibition on discrimination \nprovides:  \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.  \n \n20 U.S.C § 1681.   \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 7 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2002\n  The enactment of Title IX meant that educational institutions receiving federal funding, \nas well as non-educational institutions conducting or facilitating educational programs with \nancillary federal support, were prohibited from discriminating based on sex in their academic \ncourses or programmatic offerings, scholarships, athletic opportunities, and other matters.  Its \noriginal goal was to ensure women experienced “full citizenship stature,” including the “equal \nopportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual \ntalents and capacities.”  See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532 (1996).  \n  Title IX carves out exceptions for a number of traditional male-only or female-only \nactivities, as long as similar opportunities provided for “one sex” are provided for “the other \nsex.”    See  20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a)(1)-(8).   However,  Senator  Bayh,  one  of  the  proposal’s \narchitects, stressed that Title IX “provide[d] equal access for women and men students to the \neducational process,” but did not “desegregate” spaces and activities that have long been sex-\nseparated. 117 Cong. Rec. 30407 (1971).  \n  In 1974, Congress passed an amendment to Title IX introduced by Senator Jacob Javits \nof New York, clarifying its application to intercollegiate athletics.  See 88 Stat. 484, 612 \n(1974).  The amendment directed the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (“HEW”), \nthe Department of Education’s (“the Department”) predecessor, to issue a regulation that \ncontained “with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities, reasonable provisions considering \nthe nature of particular sports.”  Notably, this amendment further cemented that Congress \nintended Title IX to cover athletics at all levels for both males and females at schools receiving \nfederal funding.  \n  As a general matter, Title IX’s antidiscrimination provision has remained unchanged \nsince the statute’s enactment.  20 U.S.C. § 1681.  And until the last decade, Title IX was \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 8 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2003\nuniversally understood to equalize female access to educational facilities and programs by \nbarring discrimination “on the basis of sex” at schools receiving federal funds.  But then came \nthe administrative state, lacking any real power to rewrite a law that Congress duly passed, \nwith its bureaucratic cudgel.   \n  The initial effort to redefine “sex” through regulatory decree occurred between 2014 \nand  2016  when  the  Department  issued  guidance  construing  Title  IX’s  implementing \nregulations to restrict federal funding recipients from treating individuals inconsistently with \ntheir gender identity.  See Jared Cole and Christine J. Back, Cong. Rsch. Serv., LSB10229, \nTitle  IX:  Who  Determines  the  Legal  Meaning  of  “Sex”?  (2018).   In  May  2016,  the \nDepartment’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) issued a “Dear Colleague” letter, noting that \nschools may continue to provide sex-segregated facilities, such as restrooms, locker rooms, \nand showers, pursuant to existing Title IX regulations, while interpreting the prohibition of sex \ndiscrimination to encompass discrimination based on a student’s gender identity, including \ntransgender status.2  The letter warned that schools “generally must treat transgender students \nconsistent  with  their  gender  identity”  when  rendering  sex-based  distinctions  in  certain \ncircumstances, such as providing separate facilities for male and female students.  Id.  OCR \nrescinded  the  May  2016  Dear  Colleague  letter  in  the  early  days  of  the  Trump \nadministration.3  However, it neither promulgated further guidance nor issued a rule regarding \nwhether Title IX covers gender identity.  \n \n2  See Dept. of Justice & Dept. of Education, Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender \nStudents, May 13, 2016, https://www2.ed.gov/about.offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-\ntitle-ix-transgender.pdf.  \n \n3  See Dept. of Justice & Dept. of Education, Dear Colleague Letter, Feb. 22, 2017, \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf.   \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 9 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2004\nOn June 15, 2020, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Bostock v. \nClayton County, Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  The Court held that an employer violates Title \nVII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  by  firing  an  individual  for  being  homosexual  or \ntransgender.  On his first day in office, President Joseph Biden issued Executive Order 13988, \nentitled “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual \nOrientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023 (Jan. 21, 2021).  Citing Bostock, \nPresident Biden stated that “[a]ll persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no \nmatter their gender identity or sexual orientation.”  According to the President’s proclamation, \nfederal laws on the books that prohibit sex discrimination similarly “prohibit discrimination \non the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain \nsufficient indications to the contrary.”  Id.  \n  President Biden subsequently issued Executive Order 14021, captioned “Guaranteeing \nan Educational Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual \nOrientation or Gender Identity.”  Exec. Order No. 14,021, 86 Fed. Reg. 13803 (Mar. 8, \n2021).   Therein, President Biden directed the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the \nAttorney General, to review agency actions and issue new guidance as needed to comply with \nthe policy set forth in the Executive Order.  \n  The Department subsequently amended the regulations implementing Title IX on April \n29, 2024, by issuing a Final Rule: “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms  or  Activities  Receiving  Federal  Financial  Assistance”  (the  “Final  Rule”  or \n“Programs and Facilities Rule”).  89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  The Final Rule \n“clarif[ies]” that, for purposes of Title IX, “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex includes \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  stereotypes,  sex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 10 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2005\nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  Id. at 33476 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.10).  The bases listed in 34 C.F.R. § 106.10 are not exhaustive and are offered only as \nexamples to clarify the scope of Title IX’s coverage, “which includes any discrimination that \ndepends in part on consideration of a person’s sex.”  Id. at 33803.  \n  The Final Rule brings another significant change to Title IX by way of a “de minimis \nharm” standard, which provides:  \n[i]n the limited circumstances in which Title IX . . . permits different treatment \nor separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry out such different \ntreatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by \nsubjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, except as permitted by 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 \nthrough  106.15,  20  U.S.C.  §  1686  and  its  corresponding  regulation  § \n106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b).  Adopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents  a  person  from  participating  in  an  education  program  or  activity \nconsistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de \nminimis harm on the basis of sex. \n \n See id. at 33814-26 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \n  The Department declined to provide a specific definition of “gender identity,” but \nunderstands the term to “describe an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not \nbe different from their sex assigned at birth.”  Id. at 33809.  The Final Rule suggests that \nrecipients of federal funds should rely on a  student’s “consistent assertion” or “written \nconfirmation” to determine the student’s gender identity.  Id. at 33819.  Recipients, however, \nmay  not  require  students  to  submit  to  “invasive  medical  inquiries  or  burdensome \ndocumentation requirements” to determine gender identity.  Id.  \nTitle IX bans sexual harassment. \n  Harassment is not mentioned in the text of Title IX, but both the Department and the \nUnited States Supreme Court have long recognized that sexual harassment may constitute \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 11 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2006\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex for purposes of Title IX.  See OCR; Sexual Harassment \nGuidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students or Third Parties, 62 \nFed. Reg. 12034 (Mar 13, 1997); Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. Of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999).  In \n2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague letter regarding a variety of topics, including sexual and \ngender-based harassment.4  It followed up in 2014 with additional guidance that defined hostile \nenvironment sexual harassment as that which is “sufficiently serious as to limit or deny a \nstudent’s  ability  to  participate  in  or  benefit  from  the  school’s  educational  program  or \nactivity.”5  \n  In May 2020, the Department exercised its formal rulemaking authority to issue a \nregulation that defined sexual harassment under Title IX.  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis \nof Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. \nReg. 30026, 30033 (May 19, 2020) (codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.30).  In relevant part, section \n106.30 defines “sexual harassment” as “conduct on the basis of sex” that is “[u]nwelcome \nconduct  determined  by  a  reasonable  person  to  be  so  severe,  pervasive,  and  objectively \noffensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program \nor activity.” (Emphasis added.)  \n  The new rule redefines this term as “sex-based harassment,” which means “sexual \nharassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the bases described in [34 \nC.F.R.] § 106.10 . . . .”  34 C.F.R. 106.2 (effective Aug. 1, 2024).

See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33498 (explaining the adoption of the new standard).  \n  It is noteworthy that the Department does not limit harassment to speech that occurs on \nschool campuses and believes a recipient’s obligations under Title IX are triggered whenever \na school employee “has information about conduct among students that took place on social \nmedia or other platforms that reasonably may have created a sex-based hostile environment in \nthe recipient’s education program or activity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33535.   \n  The Final Rule and its accompanying regulations are scheduled to take effect August \n1, 2024.  \nIII. \nThe Plaintiffs and Intervenors \n   Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia filed a Complaint \nwith this Court on April 30, 2024, seeking to enjoin and invalidate the Final Rule and its \naccompanying regulations.  Each state is obligated through its constitution to provide a free \nsystem of public education for primary and secondary school-aged children.  Accordingly, the \nstates operate public primary and secondary schools, as well as “special schools,” for the \nhearing and visually impaired, and various public institutions of higher learning.  Pursuant to \npublic policy and state law, each of these states’ public schools generally require students to \nuse bathrooms and play on sports teams associated with the student’s biological sex.  [Record \nNo. 1, ¶¶ 206-212]  Additionally, the plaintiff-States generally do not require public schools \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 13 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2008\nor their employees to use pronouns that are inconsistent with an individual’s biological sex.  Id. \nat ¶¶ 213-217]  All of these schools receive federal funding under Title IX.    \n  Christian Educators Association International (“Christian Educators”) and A.C. were \npermitted to file an Intervenor Complaint on May 8, 2024.  Christian Educators is a religious \nnon-profit organization primarily composed of Christians in the teaching profession from all \n50 states.  Its mission is to “support, connect, and protect Christians serving primarily in public \neducation.”  The organization maintains a Statement of Faith that affirms beliefs in core \nChristian doctrines and all dues-paying members must affirm that they are Christians.  \n  Christian Educators seeks to support its members—particularly educators in K-12 \npublic schools—who wish to “live and work consistent with their shared belief that God \ncreated human beings as male and female and that sex is an immutable trait.”  It objects to \npolicies that would force educators to use pronouns that do not correspond with an individual’s \nbiological sex.  Christian Educators also takes issue with policies that chill educators from \nexpressing their sincerely held religious beliefs regarding the immutability of sex, and the \ngroup supports the rights of educators to discuss these beliefs with students and colleagues at \nwork through informal discussions both inside and outside of the classroom.  Further, Christian \nEducators disputes any policy that would require educators to share private facilities like \nrestrooms or locker rooms with persons of the opposite sex, including their students.  \n  A.C. is a 15-year-old girl who resides in West Virginia and attends Bridgeport High \nSchool.  She has played and excelled in a variety of sports since an early age.  A.C. first began \ncompeting in track and field while attending Bridgeport Middle School, and she now competes \nin these sports as a high school student.  B.P.J. is a student who was born male but identifies \nas female.  He also was allowed to compete on the Bridgeport Middle School cross-country \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 14 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2009\nand track teams.  B.P.J. was permitted to use the girls’ locker room to change clothes, which \nprompted  A.C.  to  change  clothes  elsewhere,  as  A.C.  feels  uncomfortable  dressing  and \nundressing in the presence of biological males and does not want to see biological males \nundressing.  \n  A.C. asserts that it is apparent that B.P.J.’s status as a biological male gives B.P.J. an \nadvantage over A.C. and other female athletes.  And she has tendered significant statistical \ninformation  from  her  middle  school  track  and  field  competitions  supporting  this \nopinion.  [Record No. 72-3]  While A.C. and B.P.J. presently attend different schools, A.C. \nbelieves B.P.J. will compete on the high school track team next year.  \n  The plaintiff-States and the Intervenor plaintiffs (collectively, the “plaintiffs”) lodge \nvarious objections to the Final Rule and its accompanying regulations and seek a declaratory \njudgment announcing their invalidity.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  For now, the plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive  relief  to  prevent  the  Department  from  enforcing  the  Final  Rule  and \nregulations.  They assert various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2), to wit, that the Department acted in excess of its statutory authority and in \nviolation of the United States Constitution, and that its action was arbitrary and capricious. \nIV. \nThe Standard of Review \n  The APA provides that a district court “may issue all necessary and appropriate process \nto postpone the effective date of any agency action” to the extent necessary to prevent \nirreparable injury.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  And for purposes of this Court’s analysis, a motion for a \nstay under § 705 is judged by the same standard as a motion for a preliminary injunction under \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Ohio v. Nuclear Reg. Comm’n, 812 F.2d 288, \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 15 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2010\n290 (6th Cir. 1987).  Accordingly, the Court applies the following factors to the pending \nmotions: (1) whether the movant has shown a strong or substantial likelihood of success on \nthe merits; (2) whether the movant has demonstrated irreparable injury; (3) whether the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether \nthe public interest would be served by the issuance of an injunction.  Parker v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric., 879 F.2d 1362, 1367 (6th Cir. 1989).    \n  These  factors  are  not  “prerequisites  that  must  be  met,”  but  instead,  “interrelated \nconsiderations that must be balanced together.”  Ne. Ohio Coal. for Homeless and Serv. Emps. \nIntern. Union, Local 1199 v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1009 (6th Cir. 2006).  Still, some \nshowing of irreparable harm is required—otherwise preliminary injunctive relief would not be \nnecessary.  See D.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Sch., 942 F.3d 324, 327 (6th Cir. 2019).  However, the \namount of irreparable harm the plaintiffs must prove is inversely proportional to the probability \nof success on the merits they are able to demonstrate.  See Blackwell, 467 F.3d at 1009.    \n  At the outset, the Court acknowledges that a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary \nremedy which should only be granted if the movant carries [its] burden of proving the \ncircumstances clearly demand it.”  Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov’t, 305 \nF.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002).  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is simply to preserve \nthe relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.  Certified Restoration \nDry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Univ. \nof Tex. v. Camenish, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)).  \nLikelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Start with the basics.  Title IX prohibits educational institutions receiving federal funds \nfrom discriminating against individuals “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Congress \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 16 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2011\nauthorized the Department to issue “rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability” that \nare “consistent with achievement of the objectives” of Title IX.   20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Those \nobjectives are avoiding the use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices and \nproviding individual citizens with effective protection against those practices.  Cannon v. \nUniv. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979).  \n  The APA supplies the standard for judicial review of agency rulemaking.  5 U.S.C. § \n706(2).  The plaintiffs claim that the Department violated the Act in a variety of ways, \nincluding violating its statutory authority under Title IX, acting contrarily to various provisions \nof the United States Constitution, and by acting arbitrarily and capriciously.  The Court \naddresses these arguments in turn.  \nThe Department’s interpretation of “on the basis of sex” exceeds its statutory authority.  \n  The Court accords significant deference to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an \nambiguous statute that is within the agency’s jurisdiction.6  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 865-66 (1984).  See also Nat’l Cable & Telecommc’ns. Ass’n \nBrand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005) (observing that “[i]f a statute is ambiguous, \nand if the implementing agency’s construction is reasonable, Chevron requires a federal court \nto accept the agency’s construction of the statute, even if the agency’s reading differs from \nwhat the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.”).  But an agency has no authority \nto promulgate a regulation that “undoes the unambiguous language of the statute.”  River City \nFraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, Inc. v. Ky. Ret. Sys., 999 F.3d 1003, 1009 (6th Cir. 2021) \n \n6  The Court recognizes that Chevron’s future is uncertain.  See Loper Bright Enters., et \nal. v. Raimondo, No. 22-451 (S. Ct. Argued Jan. 17, 2024).  However, this uncertainty does \nnot impact the Court’s analysis because it does not defer to the Department’s interpretation of \nTitle IX under Chevron. \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 17 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2012\n(citing Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43); see also Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., \n779 F.3d 258, 274 (5th Cir. 2015) (stating that “a broad grant of general rulemaking authority \ndoes not allow an agency to make amendments to statutory provisions”); Texas v. Cardona,--\nF.3d--, 2024 WL 2947022 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2024) (noting that “the Department lacks the \nauthority to ‘rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should \noperate’”) (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014)).  \n  In determining whether Chevron  deference is warranted, the Court  looks first to \nwhether “Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at \n842.   The  Court  begins  by  examining  whether  discrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  is \nambiguous.  This inquiry requires the Court to perform a “full interpretive analysis” to fulfill \nits “emphatic duty to say what the law is.”  See Arangure v. Whitaker, 911 F.3d 333, 336 (6th \nCir. 2018) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather than outsourcing this \nduty to the agency, the Court utilizes the traditional tools of statutory interpretation and spurns \nadministrative constructions that contravene the plain meaning of the statute.  Id. (citing \nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9).  Abdicating this obligation constitutes a “misuse of Chevron” \nand would “abrogate[] separation of powers  without even the fig leaf of Congressional \nauthorization.”  Id. (quoting Voices for Int’l Bus. & Educ., Inc. v. NLRB, 905 F.3d 770, 780-\n81 (5th Cir. 2018) (Ho, J., concurring)).  \n  The starting point for analyzing any statute is the language of the statute itself.  See \nConn. Nat’l. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992).  The Court begins with the text \nof Title IX because “a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it \nsays there.”  Id. (observing this first, cardinal canon of statutory interpretation).  Title IX’s \ngeneral prohibition against discrimination provides:  \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 18 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2013\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .  \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).   \n   \n  Because “sex” is not defined within the statute, the Court looks to its ordinary meaning \nat the time Title IX was enacted.  Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 (2018); \nsee Keen v. Helson, 930 F.3d 799, 802-04 (6th Cir. 2019) (noting that, “[w]hen interpreting \nthe words of a statute, contemporaneous dictionaries are the best place to start”).  At that time, \nthe term ordinarily was understood to mean “the character of being either male or female.”  See \nThe American College Dictionary 1109 (1970); see also Webster’s Third New International \nDictionary 2081 (1971) (“one of the two divisions of organic esp. human beings respectively \ndesignated  male  or  female”);  Webster’s  Dictionary  442  (1972)  (“the  sum  total  of \ncharacteristics, structural and functional, which distinguish male and female organisms, esp. \nwith  regard  to  the  part  played  in  reproduction”);  Funk  &  Wagnalls  Standard  College \nDictionary 1231 (1973) (“Either of two divisions, male and female, by which organisms are \ndistinguished  with  reference  to  the  reproductive  functions”);  Webster’s  New  Collegiate \nDictionary (1974) (“either of two divisions of organisms distinguished respectively as male or \nfemale”).    \n  Uncontroversially, “discriminate” means “[t]o make a difference in treatment or favor \n(of  one  as  compared  with  others).”   Bostock,  590  U.S.  at  657  (quoting  Webster’s  New \nInternational  Dictionary  745  (2d  ed.  1954)).   See  also  Merriam-Webster’s  Unabridged \nDictionary (“to make a difference in treatment or favor on a class or categorical basis in \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 19 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2014\ndisregard of individual merit).”7  And as the text of Title IX reveals, “not all differential \ntreatment  based  on  biological  sex  will  qualify  as  prohibited  discrimination”  under  the \nstatute.   Texas,  2024  WL  2947022,  at  *32.   Instead,  discrimination  means  treating  an \nindividual worse than others who are similarly situated.  Id. (citing Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n657).   The  drafters  of  Title  IX  recognized  that  “[s]afeguarding  .  .  .  equal  educational \nopportunities for men and women necessarily requires differentiation and separation” of the \nsexes at times.  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *32.  \n  “Statutory interpretation is a ‘holistic endeavor’” and, therefore, “the structure and \nwording of other parts of a statute can help clarify the meaning of an isolated term.”  Keen, \n930 F.3d at 803 (quoting United Sav. Ass’n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., \n484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988)); see also Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp.,  529  U.S.  120,  132-33  (2000)).   Thus,  while  the  meaning  of  these  terms  is \nstraightforward, the Court nevertheless examines “the context provided by the rest of the \nstatute.”  Keen, 930 F.3d at 803.  \n  The Court initially considers the various exceptions to the general prohibition on \ndiscrimination.  Section 1681(a)(1) through (9) lists multiple exceptions to the discrimination \nban, which explicitly authorize institutions to treat males and females differently in certain \nsituations.  And the language Congress employed presumes that males and females will be \nseparated  based  on  biological  sex.   For  example,  section  1681(a)(2)  provides  a  limited \nexception for educational institutions that had begun the process of changing from being an \ninstitution that only admitted students of one sex to being an institution that admitted students \n \n7  “Discriminate.”    Merriam-Webster’s  Unabridged  Dictionary,  Merriam-Webster, \nhttps://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/discriminate.

Section 1681(a)(5) provides that the prohibition does not apply to any public \ninstitution  of  undergraduate  education  “that  traditionally  and  continually  from  its \nestablishment has had a policy of admitting only students of one sex.”  \n  Additionally,  the  sex-discrimination  prohibition  does  not  apply  to  membership \npractices of certain fraternities or sororities or the Young Men’s Christian Association, Young \nWomen’s Christian Association, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, and voluntary \nyouth organizations, “the membership of which has traditionally been limited to persons of \none sex . . . .”  § 1681(a)(6)(A)-(B).  Likewise, the prohibition does not apply to “boy or girl \nconferences,” or “father-son” or “mother-daughter” activities as those events are defined under \nthe statute.  § 1681(a)(8)-(9).  And section 1686 permits educational institutions receiving \nfederal funds to maintain “separate living facilities for the different sexes.”  When Title IX is \nviewed in its entirety, its various provisions confirm that “sex” means the character of being \nmale or female.  \nThe Final Rule’s conclusion that “sex” includes gender identity is based largely on the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., 590 U.S. 644 (2020), a case \nwhich did not concern Title IX but, instead, involved claims of employment discrimination \nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.  Specifically, \nBostock involved various employers’ decisions to terminate employees based solely on their \nstatus as homosexual or transgender persons.  590 U.S. at 653.  Title VII, of course, prohibits \ndiscrimination in the employment context because of an individual’s sex.  § 2000e-2(a)(1). \n \nThe  employer-defendants  in  Bostock  argued  that  Title  VII  does  not  prohibit \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  Specifically, they asserted that, \nfor purposes of Title VII, “sex” means what it meant in 1964 and refers to “status as either \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 21 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2016\nmale or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.”  Id. at 655.  The plaintiffs countered \nthat even in 1964, “sex” was defined more broadly and “reach[ed] at least some norms \nconcerning  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation.”   Id.   The  Court  concluded  that  this \ndistinction was not outcome determinative and proceeded on the assumption that “‘sex’ . . . \nrefer[s] only to biological distinctions between male and female.”  Id. \n \n  The Court did not stop there, however.  It proceeded to flesh out “what Title VII says \nabout [sex].”  Id. at 656.  Observing that Title VII prohibits employers from taking certain \nactions “because of” sex, it noted that, “[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause \nof [the employer’s] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.”  Id. (citing Burrage v. United \nStates,  571  U.S.  204,  211-12  (2014)).   The  Court  observed  that  “homosexuality  and \ntransgender status are inextricably bound up with sex.”  For example, Bostock, who was fired \nfor being gay (i.e., being attracted to men), would not have been fired for that same trait had \nhe been a woman.   And Aimee Stephens, who was fired after she informed her employer that \nshe planned to “live and work full-time as a woman,” would not have been fired for that trait \nhad she been born female.  The Court concluded that “to discriminate on these grounds \nrequires an employer to intentionally treat the individual differently because of their sex” and, \ntherefore, violates Title VII.  Id. at 660-61.    \n  Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joined, issued a compelling dissent which \nproclaimed the majority’s opinion de facto legislation.  Id. at 683.  The dissent first observed \nthat Title VII explicitly lists the statuses that are protected under the statute—sexual orientation \nand gender identity are not included.  The dissent further noted that a court’s duty is to interpret \nstatutory terms to “mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were \nwritten.”  Id. at 685 (emphasis in original).  As Justice Alito remarked, “[i]f every single living \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 22 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2017\nAmerican had been surveyed in 1964, it would have been hard to find any who thought that \ndiscrimination because of sex meant discrimination because of sexual orientation––not to \nmention gender identity, a concept that was essentially unknown at the time.”  Id.  The dissent \nalso observed that, “[e]ven as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of ‘sex’ \nis different from discrimination because of ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity.’”  Id.    \n  More notably for present purposes, the dissent noted that the majority’s decision was \n“virtually certain to have far-reaching consequences,” since  “[o]ver 100 federal statutes \nprohibit  discrimination  because  of  sex.”  Id.  at  724  (citing,  inter  alia,  20  U.S.C.  § \n1681(a)).  These include transgender or “gender fluid” persons’ purported entitlement to use \nbathrooms and locker rooms that are reserved for persons of the sex with which they identify \nand the right of transgender persons to participate on a sports team or in an athletic competition \nreserved for members of one biological sex.  Id. at 726-27.  The dissent also observed that the \nCourt’s decision could affect the way teachers and school officials are required to address \nstudents, as plaintiffs may begin to claim that the failure to use their preferred pronoun violates \nfederal sex-discrimination laws.  Id. at 731-32.  At the same time, employers may become \npressured to suppress employee speech that expresses disapproval of same-sex relationships \nor sex reassignment procedures.  Id. at 732.  \n  The majority responded to these real-world concerns by clarifying that its decision did \nnot “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.”  Id. \nat 681.  And even with respect to Title VII, the opinion said nothing about “bathrooms, locker \nrooms, or anything else of the kind.”  Id.  Instead, the Court’s holding was limited to the narrow \nissue of “whether an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 23 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2018\nhas discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s \nsex.’”  Id.  \n  While no Sixth Circuit case following Bostock confronts the precise issues at hand, that \ncourt has clearly acknowledged the limited nature of Bostock’s holding.  L.W. by and through \nWilliams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460 (6th Cir. 2023) involved a challenge to Tennessee and \nKentucky  laws  prohibiting  healthcare  providers  from  administering  certain  medical \nprocedures to minors for purposes of attempting to alter the appearance or perception of the \nminor’s sex.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-101, Ky. Rev. Stat. § 311.372.  Transgender minors \nand their parents brought suit claiming that the laws violated their constitutional rights to due \nprocess and equal protection.  \n  In rejecting the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, the court noted that the state laws \nwere not based on sex and, therefore, were not subject to heightened review.  Specifically, it \nconcluded that the laws “treat similarly situated individuals evenhandedly” because the laws \n“regulate sex-transition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.”  Id. at 479-80.  Such an \n“across-the-board” regulation lacks the hallmarks of sex discrimination because it does not \nprefer one sex over the other.  Id. at 480.  In other words, the laws do not “bestow benefits or \nburdens based on sex” or provide different rules for males and females.  Id.  Further, the \nplaintiffs  did  not  seek  a  remedy  that  would  “equalize  treatment  options”—instead,  the \nrequested outcome was that “both sexes get a type of care or neither one does.”  \nThe court was not persuaded by the plaintiffs’ reliance on Bostock.  As an initial matter, \nit acknowledged that Bostock is limited to Title VII claims.  Id. at 484.  Further, the court noted \nthat “there is a marked difference in application of the anti-discrimination principle” at \nissue.  Id. at 485 (observing that “a case about potentially irreversible medical procedures \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 24 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2019\navailable to children falls far outside Title VII’s adult-centered employment bailiwick”).  The \ncourt also pointed to the enduring physical differences between men and women that permit \nstates  to  make  sex-based  classifications  as  long  as  they  do  not  “perpetuate[]  invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocate[] benefits and burdens.”  Id. (citing J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. \nT.B., 511 U.S. 127, 131 (1994)).  As the Sixth Circuit observed, “recognizing and respecting \nbiological  sex  differences  does  not  amount  to  stereotyping—unless  Justice  Ginsburg’s \nobservation in United States v. Virginia that biological differences between men and women \n‘are enduring’ amounts to stereotyping.”  Id. at 486 (quoting 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)).  \nSince Bostock, the Sixth Circuit also has highlighted the differences between Title VII \nand Title IX.  For example, in Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492 (6th Cir. 2021), a public \nuniversity professor filed suit against his employer after being disciplined for refusing to use \na transgender student’s preferred pronouns.  The university relied on the principles announced \nin Bostock in arguing that it had a compelling interest in stopping discrimination against \ntransgender students.  Id. at 510 (citing EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 \nF.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2018)).  The court noted, however, that Title VII “differs from Title IX in \nimportant respects,” and “it does not follow that principles announced in the Title VII context \nautomatically apply in the Title IX context.”  Id. at 510 n.4.  See also Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, \nInc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (declining to apply Bostock to an ADEA claim, as the \nSupreme Court “was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was only limited to \nTitle VII itself”).  See also Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *37 (“Title VII focuses exclusively \non hiring and firing in employment, whereas Title IX deals with educational opportunities”).  \nThe purpose of statutory construction is to give effect to the intent of Congress.  See \nUnited States v. Underhill, 813 F.2d 105, 111 (6th Cir. 1987) (citing United States v. Am. \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 25 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2020\nTrucking Ass’ns, Inc., 310 U.S. 532, 542-44 (1940)).  While Title VII allows employers to \ndiscriminate  between  the  sexes  when  the  employee’s  sex  is  a  bona  fide  occupational \nqualification, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e), Title IX is rife with instances in which males and \nfemales may be separated.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)-(9), 1686, 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.34, \n106.41(b).  Title IX’s text, coupled with the legislative history discussed at the beginning at \nthis opinion, leaves little doubt that Title IX’s drafters meant “male” and “female” when they \nwrote “on the basis of sex.”  See 118 Cong. Reg. 5807 (Feb. 28, 1972) (Statement of Sen. \nBayh) (acknowledging that Title IX “permit[s] differential treatment by sex” in various \nsituations including “in sport facilities or other instances where personal privacy must be \npreserved”).  And this conclusion is bolstered by the regulatory framework the Department \nleaves intact.  \nThe Department’s new definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” wreaks havoc \non Title IX and produces results that Congress could not have intended.  Under the new rules, \nrecipients of federal funds will still be permitted to separate the sexes for all the reasons listed \nin 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1)-(9) and § 1686.  However, recipients must permit individuals access \nto private facilities and course offerings consistent with the individual’s gender identity.  See \n34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31(a)(2), 106.33, 106.34.  For example, the new rules provide that recipients \nmay separate students for purposes of fraternities and sororities, but not for purposes of \nutilizing bathrooms.  Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)(A) and 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  Likewise, \nrecipients of federal funds may require children to participate in the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts \nconsistent with the student’s biological sex but may not require the same for sex education or \nphysical education classes.  Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)(B) and 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(a).  In \nyet another example, recipients of federal funds may still provide separate living facilities for \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 26 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2021\nthe different sexes but may not require students to use the shower or locker room associated \nwith their biological sex.  Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1686 and 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \nIn attempting to justify these inconsistencies, the Department states that it: \n \n \nhas long recognized that sex ‘separation in certain circumstances, including in \nthe  context  of  bathrooms  or  locker  rooms,  is  not  presumptively  sex \ndiscrimination’ because such sex-separate facilities generally impose no more \nthan de minimis harm on students. . . .  But consistent with federal court \ndecisions and guidelines published by respected medical organizations, the \nDepartment  explained  that  sex  separation  that  prevents  a  person  from \nparticipating in a program or activity consistent with their gender identity does \ncause more than de minimis harm—a conclusion that Plaintiffs do not dispute. \n \n \n \n[Record No. 73, p. 18 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816)] The Department attempts to explain \naway the areas in which sex segregation is still allowed by simply stating that Congress has \nspecified a “few limited contexts in which more than de minimis harm is permitted by the \nstatute.”  Id. (citing 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a), 1686).  But this throwaway reasoning does not \nreconcile these stark inconsistencies or persuade the Court that this is the result that Congress \nintended.     \n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit considered similar issues \nin Adams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. \n2022).  In Adams, a high school student who was born female, but identified as male, sued the \nschool under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title IX due to the school’s policy that prohibited her from \nusing the boys’ bathroom.  The court declined to apply the holding from Bostock in this \ncontext, observing that, unlike Title VII, Title IX includes “express statutory and regulatory \ncarve-outs for differentiating between the sexes when it comes to separate living and bathroom \nfacilities, among others.”  Id. at 811.  It reasoned that, if “‘sex’ [was] ambiguous enough to \ninclude gender identity,” then the various carve-outs would be rendered meaningless.”  Id. at \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 27 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2022\n813.  See Chrysler Corp. v. C.I.R., 436 F.3d 644, 654-55 (6th Cir. 2006) (stating that statutory \nprovisions should be interpreted so that other provisions in the statute are not rendered \ninconsistent, superfluous, or meaningless).    \n  The likely consequences of the Final Rule are virtually limitless.  Title IX prohibits \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.”  And as noted at the outset of this opinion, the Department \nacknowledges that “sex is binary and assigned at birth” but it contends that “on the basis of \nsex” includes gender identity, which describes “an individual’s sense of their gender, which \nmay or may not be different from their sex assigned at birth.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33809.    \n  With  those  principles  in  mind,  consider  the  following  hypothetical:   Taylor  is  a \nbiological male student and uses he/him pronouns.  Taylor has a hypermasculine self-identity \nthat he feels is essential to his being.  But unfortunately for Taylor, his parents gave him a \nfamily name that he finds feminine.  Taylor feels that the name Bruce is more reflective of \nhow  he  expresses  his  gender  and  has  asked  his  teacher  to  refer  to  him  by  this  new \nname.   However,  his  teacher  refuses  to  do  so  even  after  he  accuses  the  teacher  of \ndefamation.  The teacher’s refusal to acknowledge the name that comports with the student’s \ngender expression makes the student feel invisible and emasculated.  The student’s frustration \nbecomes so severe that he decides to drop out of the class.  \n  This scenario does not implicate the male/female dichotomy or subject the student to \ndiscrimination on the basis of his sex.  It does, however, arguably reflect discrimination on the \nbasis of gender identity, which would result in a violation of the new regulations.  This is an \nimpermissible result.  See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 213-14 (1976) (noting \nthat  “[t]he  rulemaking  power  granted  to  an  administrative  agency  charged  with  the \nadministration of a federal statute is not the power to make law.  Rather, it is the power to \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 28 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2023\nadopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute.”) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \n   “Title IX was enacted in response to evidence of pervasive discrimination against \nwomen with respect to educational opportunities.”  McCormick ex rel. McCormick v. Sch. Dist. \nof Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 286 (2d Cir. 2004).  While undercutting that purpose, the Final \nRule creates myriad inconsistencies with Title IX’s text and its longstanding regulations.  See \nF.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (explaining that “[a]n agency \nmay not . . .depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the \nbooks.”).  Like the district court in Louisiana, the undersigned is not persuaded that the \nordinary meaning of sex includes subjective gender identity.  See State of Louisiana, et al. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., et al., 3: 24-CV-00563, 2024 WL 2978786, at *4 (W.D. La. June 13, \n2024) (observing that “[t]here is nothing in the text or history of Title IX indicating that the \nlaw was meant to apply to anyone other than biological men and/or women”).  Accordingly, \nthe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Department exceeded its statutory \nauthority in redefining “on the basis of sex” for purposes of Title IX.   \nThe major questions doctrine counsels against the Department’s reading. \n \n  For purposes of Title IX, “sex” is unambiguous.  Therefore, there is no “implicit \ndelegation from Congress” to the Department to change or expand its meaning.  See Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 159 (explaining that Chevron deference is “premised \non the theory that a statute’s ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the \nagency to fill in the statutory gaps”).  But even if the word were ambiguous, there would be \nsignificant reason for pause before assuming that Congress “had intended such an implicit \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 29 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2024\ndelegation.”  See id.  Education is one of the most important functions of state and local \ngovernments and is an area where states “historically have been sovereign.”  Brown v. Bd. of \nEduc.,  347  U.S.  483,  493  (1954);  United  States  v.  Lopez,  514  U.S.  549,  564 \n(1995).  Accordingly, it is unlikely that Congress would have intended to delegate the authority \nto deviate from Title IX’s original purpose “in so cryptic a fashion.”  See West Virginia v. EPA, \n597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022) (quoting Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 160).    \n  The major questions doctrine assumes that Congress speaks clearly when it delegates \nto  an  agency  the  authority  to  make  “decisions  of  vast  economic  and  political \nsignificance.”  Utility Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).  See also West Virginia \nby and through Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1146-47 (11th Cir. \n2023) (suggesting that a “major question” is more likely when it “alters the traditional balance \nof federalism by imposing a condition on a state’s entire budget process”).  Thus, if an \nagency’s regulatory action “brings about an enormous and transformative expansion in [the \nagency’s] regulatory authority,” then there must be “clear congressional authorization” to do \nso.  Id.    \n  While Congressional inaction is of limited persuasive value, the Court notes that \nCongress has refused to expand Title IX to include gender identity.  See  Student Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 2015 (“SNDA”), S. 439 114th Cong. (2015).  Just like the Final Rule, \nthe SNDA prohibited discrimination based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \nidentity under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  Programs or \nactivities not complying with the SNDA would have faced losing federal funds and/or private \nlawsuits.   However,  the  SNDA  did  not  receive  enough  votes  in  the  Senate  to \nproceed.  Separation of powers requires that any legislation pass through the legislature, no \n- 29 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 30 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2025\nmatter how well-intentioned the policy may be.  See Gun Owners of Am., Inc. v. Garland, 992 \nF.3d 446, 472-73 (6th Cir. 2021).  While not outcome determinative, this factor weighs in the \nplaintiff-State’s favor, as the changes implemented under the Final Rule represent a novel \nexpansion of the Department’s power under Title IX.  See State of Louisiana, 2024 WL \n2978786, at *13-14 (concluding that the Final Rule involves a major question pursuant to the \nmajor questions doctrine).  \nThe clear statement rule weighs against the Department’s reading. \n  Title IX was enacted as an exercise of Congress’ powers under the Spending Clause \nU.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The Spending Clause gives Congress broad powers to “set the \nterms on which it disburses federal funds.”  Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \nU.S. 212, 216 (2022).  And “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the \nnature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the [recipients] agree to comply with federally \nimposed conditions.”  Id. (quoting Pennhurst State School and Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. \n1, 17 (1981)).  As with any contract, education institutions cannot “knowingly accept” funds \nfrom the federal government unless they would “‘clearly understand . . . the obligations’ that \nwould come along with doing so.”  Id. at 219 (quoting Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. \nMurphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006)).  See also South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987) \n(providing that Congress must state the conditions of receipt of federal funds “unambiguously” \nso that the states may “exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their \nparticipation”).  \n  Title IX’s language provides no indication that an institution’s receipt of federal funds \nis conditioned on any sort of mandate concerning gender identity.  The Spending Clause is an \nArticle I power, so it is likely that Congress, and not the Department or any other agency, must \n- 30 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 31 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2026\nprovide the constitutionally required clarity.  See State v. Yellen, 539 F. Supp. 3d 802, 816 \n(S.D. Ohio 2021) (citing Sch. Dist. of City of Pontiac v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d \n253, 284 (6th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (Sutton, J. concurring).  See also Bennett v. Kentucky Dep’t \nof Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 666 (1985) (acknowledging applicability of agency guidance to clarify \nthe nature of condition but noting that the statute itself provided the constitutionally required \nlevel of clarity).  \n  The Department relies on Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, 544 U.S. 167 \n(2005) in which the Supreme Court held that Title IX’s private right of action encompasses \nclaims  of  retaliation  against  an  individual  because  he  has  complained  about  sex \ndiscrimination.  The Eleventh Circuit had dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint, reasoning that \nTitle IX did not prohibit retaliation because “the statute makes no mention of retaliation.”  Id. \nat 174.  The Supreme Court remarked that this conclusion ignored the import of its repeated \nholdings construing Title IX broadly.  For instance, although the statute does not mention \nsexual harassment or a recipient’s deliberate indifference to sexual harassment, these acts have \nbeen deemed discrimination under Title IX.  Id. at 174-75.  \n  But Jackson did not involve an agency interpretation of Title IX.  See 544 U.S. at \n178.  Rather, the Court looked to Title IX and determined, based on its plain language and the \nrelevant  case  law,  that  “intentional  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex”  includes \nretaliation.  Jackson indicates that Title IX must be read broadly with respect to the category \nof discrimination that falls under the statute.  Neither Jackson nor any of the cases it cites \nindicates the statute should be read to expand the traditional definition of “on the basis of sex.”  \n  The Eleventh Circuit explained in Adams that “what constitutes ‘sex’ for purposes of \nTitle IX will have ramifications far beyond the bathroom door at a single high school” and will \n- 31 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 32 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2027\n“at the very least, generally impact . . . locker rooms, and showers, in addition to bathrooms, \nat schools across the country—affecting students in kindergarten through the post-graduate \nlevel.”  57 F.4th at 816.  This is particularly true since the Department construes this mandate \nto protect anyone “participating or attempting to participate” in a recipient’s program or \nactivity.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816.  The apparent result is that not only a recipient’s students, \nbut virtually anyone who enters a public school, would be entitled to use the facilities \nconsistent with that person’s purported gender identity.  For all these reasons, it is likely that \na clear statement from Congress equating “sex” to “gender identity” or “transgender status” is \nnecessary before states’ acceptance of federal funds may be conditioned on such a term.  See \nAdams, 57 F.4th at 816; State of Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *16 (concluding that the \nFinal Rule violates the Spending Clause).  This consideration weighs in the plaintiffs’ favor \nwith respect to their likelihood of success on the merits.  \nThe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their First Amendment claims. \n  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution stands as a sentry over one of \nthe Nation’s most indispensable freedoms through a proclamation clear and uncompromising: \n“Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, . . . .”  U.S. Const. amend. \nI.  Today’s Free Speech principles trace back to the democratic ideals of ancient Western \nCivilization.8  These early societies understood that the unfettered exchange of ideas was the \n \n8  See, e.g., Keith Werhan, The Classical Athenian Ancestry of American Freedom of \nSpeech, 2008 S. Ct. Rev. 293, 300 (“The classical Athenians adopted two free-speech concepts \nthat were central to their democracy.  The first was isēgoria, which described the equal \nopportunity of all Athenian citizens to speak in the principal political institution of the \ndemocracy,  the  Assembly.    The  second  was  parrhēsia,  which  described  the  practice  of \nAthenians to speak openly and frankly once they had the floor.” (citations and footnotes \nomitted)); Cornelius Tacitus, The Histories 3 (Kenneth Wellesley III trans., Penguin Books, \n- 32 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 33 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2028\nlifeblood of a free and vibrant polity.  Centuries later, these values were embraced by many \nEnlightenment  thinkers,  who  viewed  them  as  indispensable  to  reason  and  individual \nrights.  See, e.g., John Milton, Areopagitica 33 (J.C. Suffolk ed., Univ. Tutorial Press 1968) \n(“Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all \nliberties.”); John Locke, Two Treatises of Government 306 (Peter Laslett ed., Cambridge Univ. \nPress 1988) (“The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge \nfreedom.  For in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law, there is \nno freedom.”); 2 The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine 588 (P. Foner ed. 1945) (“He that \nwould make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he \nviolates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.”).9  \n  As  the  American  colonies  wrested  their  independence  from  British  tyranny,  the \nprimacy of free speech became even more pronounced.  Benjamin Franklin, writing under the \npseudonym Silence Dogood, encapsulated the critical nature of free speech in 1722: “Whoever \nwould overthrow the Liberty of a Nation, must begin by subduing the Freeness of Speech;” \nSilence Dogood, Letter to the Editor, No. 8, The New-England Courant (July 9, 1722).  The \ntrial of John Peter Zenger in 1735, wherein a jury acquitted him of seditious libel for publishing \nanonymous political pamphlets attacking the Crown Governor of New York, marked a seminal \n \n1995) (“Modern times are indeed happy as few others have been, for we can think as we please, \nand speak as we think.”). \n \n9  Arguably the most famous “quote” from an Enlightenment thinker is the apocryphal \ndeclaration attributed to Voltaire: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death \nyour right to say it.”  See Young v. Am. Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 63 (1976) (“The \nessence of that comment has been repeated time after time in our decisions invalidating \nattempts by the government to impose selective controls upon the dissemination of ideas.”). \n \n- 33 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 34 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2029\nmoment in the American tradition of protecting free expression.  See J. Alexander, A Brief \nNarrative of the Case and Trial of John Peter Zenger 9–19 (S. Katz ed. 1972).  \n  The Nation’s Founders enshrined these principles in the nascent republic, acutely aware \nof the profound importance of free speech to a democratic nation and the consequences of its \nabsence.  See Benjamin Franklin, On Freedom of Speech and the Press, Pa. Gazette, Nov. \n1737, reprinted in The Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol. II, 285 (Philadelphia, Hilliard, Gray \n& Co. 1840) (“Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government; when this support \nis taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its \nruins.”); see also John Adams, A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1765), reprinted \nin 3 The Works of John Adams 447, 456 (Charles C. Little & James Brown eds., 1851) \n(“[L]iberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a \nright . . . and a desire to know.”).  \n  James Madison, America’s fourth President and a chief architect of the Constitution, \nremarked that “the right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free \ncommunication among the people thereon . . . has ever been justly deemed, the only effectual \nguardian of every other right.”  James Madison, Resolutions of 1798 (Dec. 21, 1798), in 6 The \nWritings of James Madison, 1790–1802, at 328–29 (Gaillard Hunt ed., 1900).  In his First \nInaugural Address, Thomas Jefferson encapsulated the ethos of the First Amendment with the \nassertion, “[e]rror of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.”  Thomas \nJefferson, First Inaugural Address, in The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: 17 February to 30 \nApril 1801, at 148 (Barbara G. Oberg ed., 2006).  This articulation of the marketplace of ideas \nremains a cornerstone of Supreme Court jurisprudence.  See Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. \n357, 375 (1927) (“Those who won our independence believed . . . that freedom to think as you \n- 34 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 35 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2030\nwill and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political \ntruth.”).  \n  This underlying vision transcends mere tolerance by envisioning a dynamic forum \nwhere even the most politically charged and contentious ideas are open for debate.  To that \nend, speech on matters of public importance receive the highest protection under the First \nAmendment.  See N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964) (emphasizing “a \nprofound  national  commitment  to  the  principle  that  debate  on  public  issues  should  be \nuninhibited, robust, and wide-open”); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989) (“If there is \na bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit \nthe  expression  of  an  idea  simply  because  society  finds  the  idea  itself  offensive  or \ndisagreeable.”).  \n  The enduring principle of protecting pure speech is further underscored in Snyder v. \nPhelps, where the Supreme Court protected the right to express even deeply unpopular and \noffensive viewpoints.  See 562 U.S. 443, 454 (2011) (holding that the First Amendment \nprotects the right to picket outside military funerals with signs bearing messages such as, \n“Thank God for Dead Soldiers”).  But in a society that is “constantly proliferating new and \ningenious forms of expression,” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 210 (1975), it can be \n“necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary,” Mahanoy Area Sch. \nDist. v. B. L. by and through Levy, 594 U.S. 180, 193 (2021).  The Supreme Court’s consistent \ndefense of offensive and even hateful speech demonstrates a profound commitment to the \nprinciple that freedom of expression must include the protection of all ideas, no matter how \nrepugnant they may be to some.  See Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 25 (1971) (“We cannot \nlose sight of the fact that, in what otherwise might seem a trifling and annoying instance of \n- 35 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 36 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2031\nindividual  distasteful  abuse  of  a  privilege,  these  fundamental  societal  values  are  truly \nimplicated.”). \nSpeech in Schools \n  Schools are not “enclaves of totalitarianism,” where “students or teachers shed their \nconstitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”  Tinker v. \nDes Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 511 (1969).  To the contrary, the \nclassroom is the most cherished “marketplace of ideas,” where the Nation’s future leaders must \nbe exposed to a “robust exchange” of competing viewpoints.  Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, 385 \nU.S. 589, 603 (1967).  The First Amendment “does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of \northodoxy over the classroom,” id., an environment where “[t]eachers and students must \nalways remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, [and] to gain new maturity and \nunderstanding,” Sweezy v. State of N.H. by Wyman, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957).     \n  But  “the  constitutional  rights  of  students  in  public  school  are  not  automatically \ncoextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.”  See Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, \n478 U.S. 675, 682 (1986).  For example, the First Amendment does not prevent schools from \nprohibiting vulgar and offensive speech that undermines the school’s educational mission.  See \nid. at 681 (“The undoubted freedom to advocate unpopular and controversial views in schools \nand classrooms must be balanced against the society’s countervailing interest in teaching \nstudents the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior.”).  But undermining a school’s \neducational  mission  must  mean  “more  than  a  mere  desire  to  avoid  the  discomfort  and \nunpleasantness that always accompan[ies] an unpopular viewpoint.”  Tinker, 393 U.S. at \n509.  Where speech constitutes a “substantial disruption” or causes a “material interference \n- 36 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 37 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2032\nwith  school  activities,”  its  suppression  may  fall  outside  the  reach  of  First  Amendment \nprotections.10  Id. at 514.    \n  In Fraser, the Supreme Court upheld disciplinary action taken against a high school \nstudent who gave a speech at a school assembly where he referred to a fellow classmate “in \nterms of an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.”  478 U.S. at 678.  The speech \nhad an immediate and disruptive impact on many of the approximately 600 students in the \nauditorium; one teacher even felt it necessary to dedicate a portion of the following day’s class \nto discussing the speech.  Id. (“Some students hooted and yelled; some by gestures graphically \nsimulated the sexual activities pointedly alluded to in respondent’s speech.  Other students \nappeared  to  be  bewildered  and  embarrassed  by  the  speech.”).   Beyond  recognizing  the \ndisruptive nature of certain speech, the Fraser decision recognizes schools’ interest in and \nability to “protect children—especially in a captive audience—from exposure to sexually \nexplicit, indecent, or lewd speech.”  Id. at 684.  \n  Schools’ compelling interest in protecting their students may also permit them to \nregulate speech encouraging illegal activity.  See Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 410 (2007) \n(upholding the suspension of a student who unfurled a banner promoting illegal drug use at a \nschool event).  So too may schools impose certain restrictions on speech when necessary to \nmaintain student’s physical safety.  See Defoe ex rel. Defoe v. Spiva, 625 F.3d 324, 336 (6th \nCir. 2010) (upholding a ban on displaying the Confederate flag where the school reasonably \n \n10  Schools also may exercise editorial control “over the style and content of student speech \nin school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to \nlegitimate pedagogical concerns.”  Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 273 \n(1988). \n \n- 37 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 38 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2033\nforecasts it will incite disruption in light of past racial violence, tension, and threats).  But these \nlimited exceptions do not absolve schools of the need to carefully balance their duty to provide \na safe and effective learning environment with students’ rights to free expression.  \n  The impact of speech regulation within schools also has a unique impact on institutions \nthemselves as well as the faculty and staff who play a crucial role in fostering an effective \nlearning environment.  Academic freedom is a principle recognized by the Sixth Circuit “to \ndenote both the freedom of the academy to pursue its end without interference from the \ngovernment . . . and  the  freedom  of  the  individual  teacher . . . to  pursue  his  ends  without \ninterference from the academy.”  Parate v. Isibor, 868 F.2d 821, 826 (6th Cir. 1989) (quoting \nPiarowski v. Ill. Cmty. Coll. Dist. 515, 759 F.2d 625, 629 (7th Cir. 1985)).  \n  While teachers possess certain First Amendment protections over their in-class speech, \ntheir “right to academic freedom is not absolute” and may be subject to limitations that ensure \nthe effectiveness of their educational duties and the institution’s mission.  Bonnell v. Lorenzo, \n241 F.3d 800, 823 (6th Cir. 2001); see Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Tp. High School Dist., 391 \nU.S. 563, 568 (1968) (“The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests \nof the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of \nthe State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through \nits employees.”).    \n  Whether a public teacher’s speech is constitutionally protected depends on whether it \nis “public” or “private” in nature.  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146–47 (1983).  This \ndistinction  recognizes  that  “[t]he  First  Amendment  ‘was  fashioned  to  assure  unfettered \ninterchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the \npeople.’”  Id. at 145 (quoting Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 (1957)).  This form of \n- 38 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 39 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2034\nspeech is “the essence of self-government,” id. (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, \n75 (1964), “and is entitled to special protection,” id.    \n  The court looks to the “content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by \nthe whole record” in determining whether speech is public in nature.  Id. at 147–48.  “Speech \nthat relates ‘to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community’ touches upon \nmatters of public concern.”  Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll., 260 F.3d 671, 678 (2001) (quoting \nConnick, 461 U.S. at 146)).  “Thus, a teachers in-class speech about ‘race, gender, and power \nconflicts’ addresses matters of public concern.”  Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 508 (quoting Hardy, \n260 F.3d at 679).    \n  “Because the essence of a teacher’s role is to prepare students for their place in society \nas responsible citizens, classroom instruction will often fall within the Supreme Court’s broad \nconception of ‘public concern.’”  Hardy, 260 F.3d at 679 (citing Gregory A. Clarick, Note, \nPublic School Teachers and the First Amendment: Protecting the Right to Teach, 65 N.Y.U. \nL. Rev. 693, 702 (1990)).  But the court must also determine “the point of the speech in \nquestion . . . because controversial parts of speech advancing only private interests do not \nnecessarily invoke First Amendment protection.”  Dambrot v. Cent. Mich. Univ., 55 F.3d, \n1177–87 (6th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original) (cleaned up).  “The linchpin of the inquiry is, \nthus, for both public concern and academic freedom, the extent to which the speech advances \nan idea transcending personal interest or opinion which impacts our social and/or political \nlives.”  Id. at 1189.  This embrace of academic freedom and open dialogue in the classroom is \nexemplified in the following case.  \n  The Sixth Circuit decision in Meriwether v. Hartop addresses the pivotal intersection \nof academic freedom and free speech within academic settings.  992 F.3d 492, 505 (6th Cir. \n- 39 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 40 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2035\n2021).   Dr.  Nicholas  Meriwether,  a  philosophy  professor  at  Shawnee  State  University, \nchallenged the university’s disciplinary actions against him for refusing to refer to a student \nusing  pronouns  reflecting  the  student’s  “self-asserted  gender  identity.”   Id.  at \n498.  Meriwether, who used the Socratic method for class discussion, addressed his students \nas “Mr.” or “Ms.” to instill a sense of formality and seriousness into the academic setting.  Id. \nat 499.  He found this practice “an important pedagogical tool in all of his classes.”  Id.    \n  In 2018, Meriwether was approached by a transgender student11 who “demanded that \nMeriwether refer to [the student] as a woman and use feminine titles and pronouns.”  Id. \n(quotations omitted).  Due to his religious beliefs, Meriwether instead referred to the student \nby  last  name—a  practice  the  student  and  university  administration  found \nunacceptable.  Meriwether was instead presented with two options: “(1) stop using all sex-\nbased pronouns in referring to students (a practical impossibility that would also alter the \npedagogical environment in his classroom), or (2) refer to [the student] as a female, even \nthough doing so would violate Meriwether’s religious beliefs.”  Id. at 500.  When he failed to \nabide, the university’s Title IX office concluded that Meriwether’s “disparate treatment” \nconstituted a “hostile environment.”  Id.  After finding no recourse through administrative \nremedies, Meriwether sued in federal court.  After the district court dismissed Meriwether’s \nfree-speech and free-exercise claims, the Sixth Circuit reversed the holdings with an opinion \nthat sheds considerable light on the issues presently before this Court. \n \n11  Meriwether is quoted in the record as stating that “no one . . . would have assumed that \n[the student] was female” based on outward appearance.  Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 499. \n \n- 40 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 41 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2036\n  The Sixth Circuit’s opinion expressly recognized that “titles and pronouns carry a \nmessage,” and compelling someone to use preferred pronouns communicates the message that \n“[p]eople can have a gender identity inconsistent with their sex at birth.”  Id. at 507.  The court \nfound that Meriwether’s refusal to use preferred pronouns “was the message,” one that \nexpressed his belief that “sex is fixed in each person from the moment of conception, and that \nit cannot be changed, regardless of an individual’s feelings or desires.”  Id. at 509 (quotation \nomitted).  “The ‘focus,’ ‘point,’ ‘intent,’ and ‘communicative purpose’ of the speech in \nquestion was a matter of public concern,” id. at 509 (quoting Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, \n592 (6th Cir. 2004)), and it addressed “a struggle over the social control of language in a crucial \ndebate about the nature and foundation, or indeed real existence, of the sexes,” id. at 508 \n(citation  omitted).   Plainly  stated:  “[p]ronouns  can  and  do  convey  a  powerful  message \nimplicating a sensitive topic of public concern.”  Id. at 508.  \n  The  opinion  also  illustrates  the  profound  significance  of  the  First  Amendment’s \nprotection of a teacher’s in-class free speech rights more broadly.  \nIf professors lacked free-speech protections when teaching, a university would \nwield alarming power to compel ideological conformity. A university president \ncould require a pacifist to declare that war is just, a civil rights icon to condemn \nthe Freedom Riders, a believer to deny the existence of God, or a Soviet émigré \nto address his students as “comrades.” That cannot be. \n  \nId. at 505.  \n \nCompelled Speech \n \n  Individuals cannot be coerced into affirming messages with which they fundamentally \ndisagree.

Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977) (“[T]he right of freedom of \nthought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak \n- 41 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 42 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2037\nfreely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”); W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, \n319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) (“If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is \nthat no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, \nreligion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith \ntherein.”).    \n  The plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule prohibits schools from maintaining certain sex-\nbased distinctions while mandating adherence to “gender-identity notions divorced from sex \nentirely.”  [Record No. 19, p. 9]  In doing so, private and public institutions, as well as the \nstudents, faculty, and staff therein, will be forced to convey a particular message that may \ncontradict moral or religious values.  [Id. at 24]  For example, the Final Rule’s definition of \nharassment will likely compel “students and teachers to use ‘preferred’ rather than accurate \npronouns.”  [Record No. 19-1, p. 17]  Christian Educators reports that some of its members \nhave already declined requests to use “inaccurate pronouns” and “fear the new rules will \ncompel them to speak these words.”  [Record No. 63-1, p. 11].  In addition to compelling \naffirmation of gender identity through policy, the Final Rule compels silence of opposing \nviewpoints.  “There is certainly some difference between compelled speech and compelled \nsilence,  but  in  the  context  of  protected  speech,  the  difference  is  without  constitutional \nsignificance.”  Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796 (1988).  \n  The  Department  argues  that  the  Final  Rule’s  guidance  is  clear:  “nothing  in  the \nregulations requires or authorizes a recipient to violate anyone’s First Amendment rights.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 33516.  Furthermore, the Department argues that the regulations have codified a \nprovision expressly declaring that nothing in the Title IX regulations requires a recipient to \n“[r]estrict any rights that would otherwise be protected from government action by the First \n- 42 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 43 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2038\nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33492; see 85 Fed. Reg. at 30418, \n30573 (adding 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(d)(1) via the 2020 amendments).  Despite these assurances, \nthe plaintiffs contend that the text of the regulation and the Department’s past action speaks \nfor itself.  \n  The Department’s 2016 Dear Colleague Letter noted that schools “must treat students \nconsistent with their gender identity,” while noting that prior Title IX investigations were \nresolved “with agreements committing that school staff and contractors will use pronouns and \nnames consistent with a transgender student’s gender identity.”  Dep’t of Just. & Dep’t of \nEduc., Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students (May 13, 2016).  The Final Rule does \nnot depart from that position.  \n  When  commenters  questioned  whether  misgendering  could  constitute  sex-based \nharassment, the Department indicated that it could, depending on the circumstances.  See 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33516 (“Many commenters, as highlighted above, believe that misgendering is \none form of sex-based harassment.  As discussed throughout this preamble, whether verbal \nconduct constitutes sex-based harassment is necessarily fact-specific.”); id. (“[H]arassing a \nstudent—including acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility \nbased on the student’s nonconformity with stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity \nor gender identity—can constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX in certain \ncircumstances.”).  \n  In a discussion section on “Free Speech,” the Department acknowledges that “the First \nAmendment may in certain circumstances constrain the manner in which a recipient responds \nto sex-based harassment in the form of speech,” but suggests nonetheless that the Final Rule \nhas been narrowly tailored to advance the Department’s “‘compelling interest in eradicating \n- 43 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 44 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2039\ndiscrimination’ on the basis of sex.”  Id. at 33503 (quoting Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. \n609, 623–24 (1984)).    \n  To ascertain the Department’s true intention behind the 2020 First Amendment saving \nclause, 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(d)(2), one needs to look no further than the Amicus Briefs that the \nDepartment highlights on a webpage dedicated to “Resources for LGBTI+ Students.”12  In \nNovember 2021, after the saving clause had already been adopted, the United States filed an \nAmicus Brief in a case before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.13  See Brief for the United \nStates, Kluge v. Brownsburg Cmty. Sch. Corp., 64 F.4th 861 (7th Cir. filed Nov. 8, 2021), ECF \nNo. 34.  The question presented was,  \nwhether a public high school must accommodate a teacher’s religious objection \nto referring to transgender students by names and pronouns that match their \ngender identities, by permitting him to address all students by their last names \nonly, where the record shows that the accommodation harmed students and \nundermined the school’s policy of providing a supportive learning environment \nfor all students.  \n \nId. at 2–3.  As a result of the teacher’s accommodation, two transgender students reported that \nthe use of their last names “made them feel isolated and targeted.”  Id. at 6.  The students also \nexpressed that they “felt strongly that they wanted others to acknowledge their corrected \nnames, and [the teacher’s] refusal to do so hurt them.”  Id.  The faculty advisor for the school’s \nEquality Alliance club reported that “the emotional distress and the harm that was being caused \n. . . was very, very clear.”  Id.  The Brief goes on to describe the adverse effects this religious \n \n12  See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Resources for LGBTI+ Students (last visited June 11, 2024), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/lgbt.html. \n \n13  The  only  claims  before  the  Seventh  Circuit  were  grounded  in  Title  VII.    The \nGovernment’s interpretation of Title IX’s mandate is nonetheless informative. \n \n- 44 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 45 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2040\naccommodation had on students and school operations, citing a report that it was “affecting \nthe overall functioning of the performing arts department,” and that a parent referred to the \naccommodation as “‘very disrespectful and hurtful’—even ‘bordering on bullying.’”  Id. at 8 \n(cleaned up).  Ultimately, the school rescinded the accommodation and explained that if the \nteacher was unwilling to adhere to the school’s pronoun policy he could resign or would be \nfired.    \n  The Brief concludes that the last-name only accommodation “harmed students and \nincreased the school’s risk of Title IX liability,” after finding undisputed evidence that it “had \ncaused transgender students . . . significant distress and alienation.”  Id. at 12.  One of the \ntransgender students decided not to continue in that teacher’s class the following year because \nthe teacher’s “‘refusal to acknowledge his personhood and identity’ made him ‘miserable’ and \ncaused him ‘anxiety.’”  The Government concludes that “this evidence, if proven, could \npotentially support a claim that [the student] was ‘excluded from participation in,’ ‘denied the \nbenefits of,’ and ‘subjected to discrimination under’ an education program or activity under \nTitle IX.”  Id. at 29.    \n  The Government further contends that because the teacher “changed his behavior in \nobvious ways, no longer using honorifics like ‘Mr.’ and ‘Ms.’,” it served to “isolate and \nalienate those students.”  Id. at 29–30 (cleaned up).  The Brief cautioned that “practices \nadopted for discriminatory reasons—even facially neutral practices—can constitute unlawful \nintentional discrimination.”  Id.  at 31.   The  Government takes the  position that because \n“students correctly recognized that [the teacher’s] facially neutral approach was motivated by \nan aversion to referring to transgender students by names and pronouns that accorded with \ntheir  gender  identity,”  the  otherwise  neutral  naming  practice  “does  not  diminish  the \n- 45 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 46 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2041\nreasonableness of school officials’ concern that his conduct could have created a risk of Title \nIX liability.”  Id. at 31–32.  \n  It is unclear how the Government’s articulated position can be seen as anything less \nthan  a  tacit  endorsement  of  a  content-based  heckler’s  veto.14   So  long  as  the  offended \nindividuals complain with sufficient vigor, the refusal to abide by preferred pronouns can be \ndeemed harassment and exposes a recipient of Federal funds to liability under Title IX.  Given \nthe Department’s apparent interpretation of Title IX’s mandate, the saving clause is exposed \nas little more than a paper tiger.  \n  “[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means that government has no power to \nrestrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”  Ashcroft \nv. ACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 573 (2002).  “[C]ontent-based restrictions on speech [are] presumed \ninvalid,”  and  matters  of  public  importance  receive  the  highest  protection  under  First \nAmendment  jurisprudence.   Ashcroft  v.  ACLU,  542  U.S.  656,  660  (2004).    “When  the \ngovernment wishes to state an opinion, to speak for the community, to formulate policies, or \nto implement programs, it naturally chooses what to say and what not to say.”  Shurtleff v. City \nof Boston, 596 U.S. 243, 252 (2022) (citing Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, \n529  U.S.  217,  235  (2000)).   With  respect  to  the  topic  of  gender  identity,  the  Biden \n \n14  The Sixth Circuit has acknowledged the impact of the heckler’s veto, quoting an \nexplanation provided by constitutional scholar Harry Kalven: “If the police can silence the \nspeaker, the law in effect acknowledges a veto power in hecklers who can, by being hostile \nenough, get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not approve.”  Bible Believers v. \nWayne County, 805 F.3d 228, 234 n.1 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harry Kalven, Jr., The Negro \nand the First Amendment 140 (Ohio St. Univ.

Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 234 (2017), “[t]he \ngovernment  may  not  regulate  [speech]  based  on  hostility—or  favoritism—towards  the \nunderlying message expressed,” R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 386 (1992).  Nor can \nthe Government compel speech “to ‘excise certain ideas or viewpoints from the public \ndialogue.’”  303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 588 (2023) (quoting Turner Broad. \nSys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 642 (1994)).  \n  The Department’s Final Rule forces the Nation’s schools and educators to convey a \nmessage ordained in Washington, D.C., while silencing dissenting opinions and undermining \nstate law and the discretion of local school boards.  See Nat’l Rifle Assoc. of Am. v. Vullo, No. \n22-842, slip op. at 1 (U.S. 2024) (“A government entity’s ‘threat of invoking legal sanctions \nand other means of coercion’ against a third party ‘to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored \nspeech violates the First Amendment.”).  In his 2024 Proclamation on Transgender Day of \nVisibility, President Biden declared that “extremists are proposing hundreds of hateful laws \nthat  target  and  terrify  transgender  kids  and  their  families—silencing  teachers; \n \n15  See, e.g., Exec.

Reg. 22901 (Mar. \n29, 2024).  To cite just one example, Tennessee law provides that teachers are not “[r]equired \nto use a student’s preferred pronoun when referring to the student if the preferred pronoun is \nnot consistent with the student’s biological sex.”  Tenn Code Ann. § 49-6-5102(b); see also \nKy. Rev. Stat. § 158.191(5)(c) (protecting the same).  In other words, Tennessee teachers are \nnot  compelled  to  communicate  the  message  that  “[p]eople  can  have  a  gender  identity \ninconsistent with their sex at birth.”  See Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 507.  Under the Final Rule, \nthese teachers will be silenced.  The Final Rule only suppresses one side of the debate, \nstrangling the marketplace of ideas in a way that is “uniquely harmful to a free and democratic \nsociety.”  Nat’l Rifle Assoc. of Am., No. 22-842, slip op. at 8.   \n  The Supreme Court has spoken clearly on this issue.  In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, the \nCourt struck down a city ordinance that prohibited speech or symbols one knows or has reason \nto know “arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion \nor gender.”  505 U.S. 377, 379 (1992).  The Court found the ordinance impermissibly engaged \nin viewpoint discrimination by “impos[ing] special prohibitions on those speakers who express \nviews on disfavored subjects.”  Id. at 391.  Similarly, the Final Rule here attempts to compel \nspeakers to affirm the concept of gender identity, while punishing or silencing those with a \ndifferent perspective.  That is plainly impermissible.  See id. at 392 (“[The government] has \nno such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to \nfollow Marquis of Queensberry rules.”).   \n  The  Final  Rule  compels  speech  and  otherwise  engages  in  viewpoint \ndiscrimination.   This  consideration  weighs  in  the  plaintiffs’  favor  with  respect  to  their \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  \n- 48 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 49 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2044\nChilled Speech \nChilled  speech  differs  from  the  overt  suppression  of  speech  because  it  is  self-\nimposed.   Laws and regulations imposing broad and vague restrictions on speech can deter \nindividuals from exercising their rights out of fear of punishment.  The result is that the \navoidance of wrongdoing leads people to “steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the \nboundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.”  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, \n486–87 (1965).  “Overbroad laws ‘may deter or “chill” constitutionally protected speech,’ and \nif would-be speakers remain silent, society will lose their contributions to the ‘marketplace of \nideas.’”  United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 769–70 (2023) (quoting Virginia v. Hicks, \n539 U.S. 113, 119 (2003)).  A law or regulation “may be invalidated as overbroad if a \nsubstantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s \nplainly legitimate sweep.”  United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010).  “Narrow \ntailoring is crucial where First Amendment activity is chilled—even if indirectly—‘[b]ecause \nFirst Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.’”  Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 609 (2021) (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)).  A \nregulation  can  also  be  impermissibly  vague  if  it  “fails  to  provide  people  of  ordinary \nintelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,” or “if it \nauthorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Hill v. Colorado, \n530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (citing Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56–57 (1999)).  \nThe plaintiff-States contend that the Final Rule’s “broadened harassment definition” \nwill chill the speech of those who object to the gender-identity mandate.  [Record No. 19-1, \n9].   Christian  Educators  similarly  condemns  the  Final  Rule  as  both  overbroad  and \nvague.  [Record No. 63-1, p. 26].  It argues that the Final Rule is vague because the gender-\n- 49 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 50 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2045\nidentity mandate includes undefined “subjective concepts,” and is overbroad because the new \namorphous harassment standard only requires conduct be “severe or pervasive,” and is entirely \ndependent on a claimant’s subjective sense of harm.  [Id.] \nThe plaintiffs’ chilled speech concerns largely coalesce around the interplay of the \nFinal  Rule’s  definitions  of  “sex,”  “sex-based  harassment,”  and  “hostile  environment \nharassment.”   The  expansive  new  definition  of  “sex,”  includes  “sex  stereotypes,  sex \ncharacteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 33886 (adding 34 C.F.R. § 106.10 to increase the scope of “discrimination on the \nbasis of sex”).  Commenters share the plaintiffs’ concerns regarding vagueness.    \nSome  commenters  argued  that  the  term  “gender  identity”  is  subjective, \nunconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and requires “self-identification” of which \nothers may not be aware, or that may change unbeknownst to a recipient.  One \ncommenter asserted that the failure to define the term makes it impossible for \nrecipients to determine how to adequately ensure they do not discriminate on \nthat basis. \nId. at 33809.  In response to those concerns, the Department stated that it “disagrees that the \nterm ‘gender identity’ is too vague, subjective, or overbroad . . . . The Department understands \ngender identity to describe an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be \ndifferent from their sex assigned at birth.”  Id.  But the Department’s response offers no \nguidance whatsoever.  Arguably worse, it suggests that this term of vital importance can be \nsubjectively defined by each and every individual based entirely upon his or her own internal \nsense of self.  \n  The Final Rule takes that expanded—and undefined—characterization of “sex,” and \nplaces it into a newly defined prohibition on “sex-based harassment.”   \n- 50 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 51 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2046\nSex-based harassment prohibited by this part is a form of sex discrimination and \nmeans sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on \nthe bases described in § 106.10, that is:   \n(1) Quid pro quo harassment. . . . ;  \n(2) Hostile environment harassment. . . . ; or  \n(3) Specific offenses. . . .  \n \nId. at 33884 (amending 34 C.F.R. § 106.02).  The focus of the plaintiffs’ concern pertains to \n“hostile  environment  harassment,”  which  is  also  a  newly  defined  term.   It  includes  the \nfollowing:  \nUnwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, \nis subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it \nlimits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s \neducation program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment). . . .  \n \nId. \n \n  This definition is once again vague, but the entirely fact-dependent and subjective \nnature  of  it  also  makes  it  overbroad.   How  does  one  determine  when  conduct  will  be \n“objectively offensive”?  Whose standard is the measure of objectivity?  Take the following \ncomments regarding misgendering as an example.  “[C]ommenters urged the Department to \nclarify  that  misgendering  is  a  form  of  sex-based  harassment  that  can  create  a  hostile \nenvironment,  especially  for  gender-nonconforming  and  LGBTQI+  students.”   Id.  at \n33516.  And another: “Many commenters, as highlighted above, believe that misgendering is \none form of sex-based harassment.”  Id.  Contrast those viewpoints with this one: “Some \ncommenters argued that prohibiting misgendering as a form of harassment could lead to \ncompelled speech in violation of the First Amendment and could be used to target people with \nunpopular viewpoints.”  Id.  Considering this is a hotly debated topic of public interest, how \ncan there be an “objective” standard?  Unsurprisingly, the Department has no answer other \n- 51 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 52 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2047\nthan to note that it is “fact-specific” and that “a stray remark, such as a misuse of language, \nwould not constitute harassment under this standard.”  Id. \n   The problem highlighted above is one the Supreme Court has previously addressed in \nthe  context  of  “true  threats”  and  “the  danger  of  deterring  non-threatening \nspeech.”  Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66, 78 (2023).  “An objective standard, turning \nonly on how reasonable observers would construe a statement in context, would make people \ngive threats ‘a wide berth.’”  Id. (quoting Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 47 (1975) \n(Marshall, J., concurring)).  Concerningly, “that degree of deterrence would have substantial \ncosts in discouraging the ‘uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate that the First Amendment \nis intended to protect.’”  Rogers, 422 U.S. at 48 (Marshall, J., concurring) (quoting N.Y. Times \nCo. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964)).  But in this case, the “objective standard” is \ninherently not objective at all because the Final Rule imposes a viewpoint consistent with the \naffirmation of gender identity.  So, in the context of misgendering, the offensive conduct must \nbe “subjectively offensive” and “objectively offensive” as viewed through the lens of someone \nwho recognizes sex and gender to be separate and distinct.  \n  Similarly vague, what is required for conduct to be “so severe or pervasive”?  Once \nagain, the Court is not alone in wondering: “One commenter questioned how a recipient would \nmeasure  whether  the  conduct  was  sufficiently  severe  or  pervasive.”   89  Fed.  Reg.  at \n33508.  The Department responds by once again affirming that “isolated comments” would \ngenerally not suffice.  Id.  But it cannot render a de facto “ban on political speech constitutional \nby carving out a limited exemption through an amorphous regulatory interpretation.”  Citizens \nUnited v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. 310, 324 (2010).  And as Christian Educators \nrightly points out, “pronoun usage is pervasive given its ubiquity in conversation.”  [Record \n- 52 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 53 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2048\nNo. 63-1, p. 27]  So anyone refusing to use preferred pronouns, be it for moral or religious \nreasons, would necessarily be engaging in pervasive conduct.    \n  The Final Rule goes on to “clarify” that “conduct meets the ‘severe or pervasive’ \nstandard of sex-based harassment if it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or \nbenefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33508.  If the \n“severe or pervasive” standard derives its definition not from some measurable criteria, but \nfrom an entirely fact-dependent consequence, the clause is without meaning.  The obviousness \nof this flaw becomes more apparent after addressing the next question.  \n  What is the threshold for determining when one’s participation in or benefit from a \nprogram or activity has been limited?   \nSome  commenters  said  that  the  term  “limits”  is  vague  and  overly \nbroad.  Commenters expressed concern that the use of the term “limits” would \nthreaten protected speech, cover conduct that detracts in any way from another \nstudent’s enjoyment of the recipient’s education program, require a recipient to \nprimarily consider the conduct from the complainant’s perspective, and expose \npostsecondary institutions to lawsuits from students alleging they were expelled \non arbitrary grounds.  \n \nId. at 33511.  The Department reasons that “[w]hether conduct limits or denies a person’s \nability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity is a fact-\nbased inquiry that requires consideration of all relevant and not otherwise impermissible \nevidence.”  Id.  It also recognizes that “individuals react to sexual harassment in a wide variety \nof  ways.”   Id.   It  further  clarifies  that  “the  definition  of  hostile  environment  sex-based \nharassment does not require a complainant to demonstrate any particular harm, . . . . [but] some \nimpact  on  their  ability  to  participate  or  benefit  from  the  education  program  or \nactivity, . . . .”  Id. (emphasis added).    \n- 53 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 54 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2049\n  To summarize, hostile environment harassment is: (1) unwelcome; (2) sex-based; (3) \ndetermined by the totality of the circumstances; (4) subjectively offensive; (5) objectively \noffensive; (6) so severe or pervasive; and it must (7) limit or deny a person’s ability to \nparticipate in or benefit from a program or activity.   Unwelcomed and subjectively offensive \nare  both  determined  by  the  complainant.   The  objective  standard  of  offensiveness  will \nnecessarily depend on the totality of the circumstances and a viewpoint imposed by the \nDepartment.  Whether it is sex-based is dependent on vague terminology the Department has \nelected not to define.  And whether the conduct is severe or pervasive is entirely measured by \nwhether it limits or denies a person’s participation or benefit in a program or activity, and the \nsufficiency of said limitation will depend, in part, on how the complainant reacts to the \nconduct.    \n  In other words, students, teachers, States, and Federal funding recipients will all be \nexpected to comply with Department guidance that is as user-friendly and objective as Justice \nStewart’s obscenity test: “I know it when I see it.”  Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 \n(1964) (Stewart, J., concurring).  It is obvious that the public’s confusion comes as no surprise \nto the Department—the Final Rule has entire comment and discussion sections dedicated to \naddressing “Vagueness and Overbreadth,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33494, “Prohibiting or Chilling \nSpeech,” id. at 33502, and “Compelled Speech,” id., just to highlight a few.  The Department \nwas presented with public comment expressing concerns that key terminology was vague.  Not \nonly did the Department fail to meaningfully address these First Amendment concerns, but it \nalso intentionally opted to leave the vague terms undefined.    \n- 54 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 55 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2050\n  Further, the Final Rule authorizes, if not encourages, arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement pursuant to definitions of harassment that are almost entirely fact-dependent.  The \nfact-specific inquiry that recipients are directed to contemplate consider the following factors:  \n(i) The degree to which the conduct affected the complainant’s ability to \naccess the recipient’s education program or activity;  \n(ii) The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct;  \n(iii) The parties’ ages, roles within the recipient’s education program or \nactivity, previous interactions, and other factors about each party that may be \nrelevant to evaluating the effects of the conduct;   \n(iv) The location of the conduct and the context in which the conduct \noccurred; and   \n(v) Other sex-based harassment in the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.  \n \nId. at 33884.  These factors are inherently flexible and grant extraordinary discretion to \nwhoever may be tasked with interpreting a suspected instance of harassment.  While this level \nof flexibility certainly has administrative benefits, it places far too much discretion over speech \nprotected under the First Amendment.  And because the Final Rule mandates an acceptance of \ngender identity concepts, the discretion only flows in one direction.  \n  The Final Rule also extends to speech outside of the classroom.     \n \n[A] recipient’s obligation is to address all forms of sex discrimination, including \nsex-based harassment that occurs within the recipient’s education program or \nactivity, whether the conduct takes place online, in person, or both.  Online \nharassment can include, but is not limited to, unwelcome conduct on social \nmedia platforms such as sex-based derogatory name-calling, the nonconsensual \ndistribution of intimate images (including authentic images and images that \nhave been altered or generated by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies), \ncyberstalking, sending sex-based pictures or cartoons, and other sex-based \nconduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and \nobjectively offensive and so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a \nperson’s  ability  to  participate  in  or  benefit  from  the  recipient’s  education \nprogram or activity.  \n \n- 55 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 56 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2051\nId. at 33515.  The Department suggests that this understanding is consistent with the holding \nof Mahanoy, and more specifically the  examples provided in Justice Alito’s concurring \nopinion.   But  the  Department’s  reading  of  the  concurrence  stops  curiously  short  of  the \nopinion’s clarifying statements. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, there is a category of speech that is almost \nalways beyond the regulatory authority of a public school.  This is student \nspeech that is not expressly and specifically directed at the school, school \nadministrators, teachers, or fellow students and that addresses matters of public \nconcern,  including  sensitive  subjects  like  politics,  religion,  and  social \nrelations.  Speech on such matters lies at the heart of the First Amendment’s \nprotection. . . .  \n. . . .  It is unreasonable to infer that parents who send a child to a public school \nthereby authorize the school to take away such a critical right.  \n Mahanoy, 594 U.S. at 205–06 (Alito, J., concurring).  The problem remains that the Final \nRule’s underlying terminology is vague and intentionally undefined.  In addition to chilling \nspeech in schools, it seeks to root out “all forms of sex discrimination” occurring online, so \nlong as it meets the amorphous and discretionary definition provided.  Such a sweeping and \nsubjective standard most certainly chills protected speech. \n \n  Because the Final Rule’s text is vague and overbroad in a way that impermissibly chills \nprotected speech, this  consideration weighs in the plaintiffs’ favor with respect to their \nlikelihood of success on the merits. \n \nStates’ Rights \n \nThe States are validly before the Court based on a modern form of the “parens patriae” \nauthority allowing them to sue the federal government.  The common law authority, which \nrests primarily in state attorneys general in the United States, traces its origins to the English \nKing’s  power  to  sue  the  government  on  behalf  of  the  citizenry  as  the  “parent  of  the \ncountry.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 \n- 56 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 57 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2052\n(1982).  The Sixth Circuit recognizes claims pursuant to this authority when a State “seeks to \nvindicate its own sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests against the United States” without \nmerely “represent[ing] its citizens in a purely third-party . . . capacity.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 \nF.4th 585, 596 (6th Cir. 2022); but see Texas v. SEC, 2024 WL 2106183, at *3 (5th Cir. May \n10, 2024) (acknowledging the Supreme Court has yet to clarify to “what extent states can still \nbring a parens patriae suit against the federal government when a state asserts its own \nsovereign or quasi-sovereign interest” following the decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \nU.S. 255, 295 (2023)).  Although states often purport to sue in a “parens patriae” capacity by \nrepresenting the interests of individuals within their states, they are generally asserting some \nspecific injury to their own interests separate and apart from their citizens’ interests.  In such \ncases, the Supreme Court has held “the State has an interest independent of and behind the \ntitles of its citizens” to safeguard “its domain” in applicable areas.  Georgia v. Tenn. Copper \nCo., 206 U.S. 230, 237 (1907). \n \n  States have a variety of sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests that they can vindicate \nin court.  As a general matter, individual states have an interest in “the exercise of sovereign \npower over individuals and entities within the relevant jurisdiction—this involves the power \nto create and enforce a legal code, both civil and criminal.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc, 458 \nU.S. at 601.  Therefore, “states may have standing based on (1) federal assertions of authority \nto regulate matters they believe they control, (2) federal preemption of state law, and (3) federal \ninterference with the enforcement of state law.”  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 \n(5th Cir. 2015).  More specifically, “[b]ecause a state alone has the right to create and enforce \nits legal code, only the state has the kind of direct stake necessary to satisfy standing in \ndefending the standards embodied in that code.”  See generally Texas v. Becerra, 623 F. Supp. \n- 57 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 58 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2053\n3d 696, 714 (N.D. Tex. 2022).  And with critical importance, the Supreme Court for more than \nhalf a century has considered “education [as] perhaps the most important function of state and \nlocal governments.”  Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954).  The Court has affirmed \nthe importance of state and local control over education on multiple subsequent occasions.  \nNo single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control \nover the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential \nboth to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools \nand to quality of the educational process.  Thus, in San Antonio Independent \nSchool  District  v.  Rodriguez,  . . . we  observed  that  local  control  over  the \neducational process affords citizens an opportunity to participate in decision-\nmaking, permits the structuring of school programs to fit local needs, and \nencourages  ‘experimentation,  innovation,  and  a  healthy  competition  for \neducational excellence.’ \n \n Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 741–42 (1974) (citation omitted).  \n  Indeed,  the  Court  has  specifically  cautioned  that  “[j]udicial  interposition  in  the \noperation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and \nrestraint,” and that “[b]y and large, public education in our nation is committed to the control \nof state and local authorities.” Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 578 (1975).  Because the federal \ngovernment’s “intrusions [can be] analogous to pressure to change state law” within this \ndomain, States have  an independent stake in defending their own  educational laws and \nregulations.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 153.    \n  States likewise maintain a valid interest in protecting the health and wellbeing of their \ncitizenry.  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc., 458 U.S. at 605; see also Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. \n208, 241 (1901) (noting states’ interest in “the health and comfort of the[ir] inhabitants”); \nPennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 592, (1923) (concluding that a state could litigate \nto defend the “health, comfort, and welfare” of its citizens).  By extension, state governments \nhave an abiding interest in “preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.”  Schall v. \n- 58 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 59 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2054\nMartin, 467 U.S. 253, 265 (1984).  This interest gives States broad power even to “limit[ ] \nparental freedom” when the welfare of children is at stake.  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. \n158, 167 (1944).  It follows that the States similarly have an interest in protecting the safety \nand wellbeing of students, faculty, and visitors on property and within facilities belonging to \npublic educational institutions within their domains.  See L.W. by and through Williams v. \nSkrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 474 (6th Cir. 2023).  \n  More  than  quasi-sovereign  and  sovereign  interests  are  at  stake,  however.   Each \nplaintiff-State has independent legal obligations pursuant to their state constitution or state \nstatute to provide a variety of educational services and opportunities that would be impacted \nif the Final Rule becomes effective.  Many would be forced to abandon enforcement of their \nown laws or risk the loss of federal funding because they operate “education program[s]” and \n“activities” that “receiv[e] federal financial assistance” within the meaning of Title IX through \nstate level agencies and local subdivisions.  20 U.S.C. § 1681.    \n  Specifically, Tennessee has an obligation to “provide for the maintenance, support and \neligibility  standards  of  a  system  of  free  public  schools.”   Tenn.  Const.  art.  XI,  §  12. \nTennessee’s legislature also “establish[es] and support[s] . . . postsecondary educational \ninstitutions, including public institutions of higher learning,” which total 51 in the state.  Tenn. \nConst. art. 11, § 12.  The legislature also provides support and direction to 150 “[l]ocal \neducation agencies” in the form of local school districts.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-1-103.    \n  Directly applicable here, Tennessee law does not require educational institutions to \nallow students to access bathrooms and facilities “consistent with their gender identity” and \nprovides that public schools may not accommodate a student’s desire for greater privacy in \nmultiple-occupancy facilities by allowing access to a restroom or changing facility that is \n- 59 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 60 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2055\ndesignated for use by members of the opposite biological sex while members of the opposite \nsex are present or could be present.  Cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816, 33818-20, with, Tennessee \nAccommodations for All Children Act, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-2-801 et seq.; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. §§ 49-2-802(2).  Tennessee schools could even be exposed to civil liability arising \nfrom compliance with the Final Rule’s mandate that students be allowed to use facilities \nassociated with their gender identity because Tennessee gives public school students, teachers, \nand  employees  a  private  right  of  action  for  monetary  damages  against  a  school  that \n“intentionally allow[s] a member of the opposite sex to enter [a] multi-occupancy restroom or \nchanging facility while other persons were present.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-2-805(a).    \n  Even more, Tennessee law provides that public school teachers and employees are not \n“[r]equired to use a student’s preferred pronoun when referring to the student if the preferred \npronoun  is  not  consistent  with  the  student’s biological  sex.”   Tenn  Code  Ann.  §  49-6-\n5102(b).  Tennessee also protects by statute the rights of students and faculty to express even \n“offensive” ideas in the classroom.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-7-2405.    \n  Similarly, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has a constitutional obligation to “provide \nfor an efficient system of common schools throughout the State.”  Ky. Const. § 183.  Kentucky \ncode also requires local boards to adopt policies that do “not allow students to use restrooms, \nlocker rooms, or shower rooms that are reserved for students of a different biological sex.”  Ky. \nRev. Code § 158.189.  The Commonwealth operates 1,477 public schools serving primary and \nsecondary school-aged children. There are also twenty-four public postsecondary educational \ninstitutions, including sixteen community and technical schools.  These institutions are subject \nto Title IX as recipients of federal funds.  With particular relevance here, Kentucky law \nprohibits the Kentucky Department of Education and its local subdivisions from requiring or \n- 60 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 61 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2056\nrecommending policies for the use of pronouns that do not align with the student’s sex as \ndetermined at birth.  Ky. Rev. Stat. § 158.191(5)(b).  Additionally, local school districts cannot \nrequire school personnel or students to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s biological \nsex.  Id.  § 158.191(5)(c).  \n  The State of Indiana which operates 1,769 public schools has a constitutional obligation \nto  “encourage,  by  all  suitable  means,  moral,  intellectual,  scientific,  and  agricultural \nimprovement” and “to provide, by law, for a general and uniform system of Common Schools, \nwherein tuition shall be without charge, and equally open to all.”  Ind. Const. art. VIII, § 1.  In \nIndiana, there are seven public institutions of higher education. See generally Ind. Code § 21-\n19 et. seq.  And state law specifically protects the religious viewpoints of students and their \nparents that reject the separation of “biological sex” and “gender.”  See Ind. Code § 20-33-12-\n2 (providing that “[a] public school shall treat a student’s voluntary expression of a religious \nviewpoint, if any, on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner the public school \ntreats a student’s voluntary expression of a  secular or other viewpoint on an otherwise \npermissible subject and may not discriminate against the student based on a religious viewpoint \nexpressed by the student on an otherwise permissible subject”).  Once again, the state would \nbe forced to decide between enforcement of these laws or enforcement of the new Title IX \ngender identity mandate.  \n  The Commonwealth of Virginia has a constitutional obligation to “provide for a system \nof free public elementary and secondary schools for all children of school age throughout the \nCommonwealth.”  Va. Const. art. VIII, § 1.  There are 1,944 public schools serving elementary \nand secondary school-aged children in that Commonwealth, as well as fifteen public four-year \ninstitutions of higher education, twenty-four public two-year institutions of higher education, \n- 61 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 62 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2057\nfive  regional  higher  education  centers,  and  one  semi-public  medical  school.   The \nCommonwealth of Virginia’s state constitution likewise protects the free exercise and free \nspeech rights of its citizens, including the right of an individual to avoid using a person’s \npreferred gender pronouns based on these protections.  \n  West Virginia has fifty-five school districts as created by the state legislature.  See W. \nVa. Code § 18-1-3.  These districts “are a part of the educational system of the state” and are \n“established in compliance with article 12, section 1, of [West Virginia’s] Constitution.” \nKrutili v. Bd. of Educ. of Butler Dist., 129 S.E. 486, 487 (W. Va. 1925).  All districts in West \nVirginia  receive  federal  funds—administered  by  the  West  Virginia  Department  of \nEducation—and are thus subject to Title IX.  West Virginia’s legislature has also established \nat least twenty public institutions of higher learning that are similarly subject to Title IX based \non their status as recipients of federal funding.  W. Va. Code § 18B-2A-1(b).    \n  And Ohio is constitutionally obligated to “secure a thorough and efficient system of \ncommon schools throughout the State,” as well as to provide “by law for the organization, \nadministration and control of the public school system of the state.”  Ohio Const. art. VI, §§ \n2-3. 194.  Many of its public school systems and postsecondary educational institutions receive \nfederal assistance, subjecting them to Title IX.  \n  The common thread if the Final Rule is enacted is that state officials would be forced \nto choose between enforcing their own laws, essentially protecting their independent quasi-\nsovereign and sovereign interests, or violating the Title IX gender identity mandate.  Many of \nthese interests focus on protecting student safety in sensitive areas such as bathrooms and other \nfacilities on the grounds of educational institutions.  But as a separate court held in Tennessee \nv. U.S. Department of Education, States indeed maintain an undeniable “sovereign interest[] \n- 62 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 63 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2058\nin enforcing their duly enacted state laws.”  615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 841 (E.D. Tenn. 2022).  See \nalso State of Tenn. v. Dep’t of Educ., --F.4th--, 2024 WL 2984295, at *4-*7 (6th Cir. June 14, \n2024) (determining that States have legitimate propriety interests if federal regulations threaten \nstates’ coffers and legitimate quasi-sovereign interests in the continued enforcement of their \nown statutes). \n  Based on the obvious tension between each  of the plaintiff-States’ laws and the \nproposed Final Rule, it appears likely that the States “will continue to face substantial pressure” \nto disregard their own laws “in order to avoid material legal consequences.”  Tennessee, 615 \nF. Supp. 3d at 841; cf. LaShonda v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 657-58 (1999) \n(Kennedy,  J.,  dissenting)  (“[M]any  school  districts,  desperate  to  avoid  Title  IX  peer \nharassment suits, will adopt whatever federal code of student conduct and discipline the \nDepartment of Education sees fit to impose on them.”).  Indeed, certain States could face civil \nliability in some circumstances for disregarding their own duly enacted laws by complying \nwith the Final Rule’s gender identity mandate.  Even for those free of this risk, the Final Rule \nsquarely implicates the plaintiff-States' powers and abilities to govern themselves as sovereign \nand independent entities.  \nThe plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their parental rights claim. \n  The plaintiff-States claim that the Department has also failed to account for the impact \nits Final Rule will have on the constitutional right of parents to influence their children’s \neducation.  A longstanding right recognized by the Supreme Court is the right for parents to \nraise their own children as they see fit.  See, e.g., Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972) \n(finding that “primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established \nbeyond debate as an enduring American tradition.”); Zelman v. Simmons–Harris, 536 U.S. \n- 63 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 64 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2059\n639, 680 n.5 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasizing that “[t]his Court has held that \nparents have the fundamental liberty to choose how and in what manner to educate their \nchildren”).  Parents’ “fundamental right . . . to make decisions concerning the care, custody, \nand control of their children[,]” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000), “is ‘far more \nprecious than [any] property right[ ].”  Siefert v. Hamilton County, 951 F.3d 753, 762 (6th Cir. \n2020).  It follows that parents retain a constitutionally protected right to guide their own \nchildren on matters of identity, including the decision to adopt or reject various gender norms \nand behaviors.  \n  The plaintiff-States argue that the Department threatens parental rights by requiring \nschool administrators to “take prompt and effective action” to accommodate the stated gender \nidentity of each student, including young students.  87 Fed. Reg. 41571–72 (proposed 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.44(a)).  Indeed, the Final Rule’s provisions seemingly bind administrators to treat \nsuch children “consistent with [their] gender ident[ies]” on school grounds, even if that \nconflicts with parental preferences.  Id. at 41571.  Therefore, school personnel would be forced \nto improperly insert themselves into constitutionally protected family affairs not only to act \nwhen  gender  discrimination  is  claimed  but  to  “prevent  its  recurrence  and  remedy  its \neffects.”  Id 41572.   In practice, this translates to policing basic interactions among students, \nparents, and faculty to compel public accommodation of each person’s individualized and \nunverifiable gender identity.  Id. at 41571 (proposed 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.10, 106.31(a)(2)).   This \nundermines a meaningful role for parents if the child decides his or her biological gender is \nnot preferential.  School personnel would be forced to abide by the student’s wishes if the \nstudent chooses not to involve his or her parents.  As the Sixth Circuit had emphasized, nothing \ncould be more noxious to the “enduring American tradition” that gives a child’s parents the \n- 64 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 65 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2060\n“primary role . . . in the upbringing of their children.”  Barrett v. Steubenville City Sch., 388 \nF.3d 967, 972 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Yoder, 406 U.S. at 232).  As such, the forced transferal \nof this role to school faculty by the Final Rule directly undermines traditional responsibilities \nreserved for parents.  \n  The Department seeks to subvert this argument, noting that “nothing in the final \nregulations disturbs parental rights” in response to commenters’ concerns about overriding \nparental choices regarding a child’s gender identity.  87 Fed. Reg. 33821.  Although the Final \nRule gestures at retaining a certain role for parents, it does not provide that parental opposition \nto their child’s selective gender identity requires schools to exempt that student from Title IX’s \nnew mandate.  To the contrary, it implies that Title IX could supersede parental preferences \nabout a child’s treatment depending on the case.  87 Fed. Reg. 33822.  Indeed, the Department \nstates that “deference to [parental] judgment . . . is appropriate” when a “parent and minor \nstudent  disagree  about  how  to  address  sex  discrimination  against  that \nstudent.”  Id.  Additionally, the Department contends that the regulations do not prevent a \nrecipient educational institution from “disclosing information about a minor child to their \nparent who has the legal right to receive disclosures on behalf of their child.”  Id.    \n  But the Final Rule fails to clarify whether the gender-identity mandate requires schools \nto adopt a student’s gender identity based solely on a student’s wishes when the parent is not \ninvolved in the child’s decision to identify as a gender other than his or her biological \nassignment.  It also fails to clarify whether the mandate means schools must adopt their \nstudents’ gender identity even over a parental objection.  This creates uncertainty not only for \nfamilies but also school personnel who could face liability for discrimination under Title IX if \na student’s preferred gender identity clashes with parental preferences.  The Department must \n- 65 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 66 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2061\nrecognize that “[t]here [is] a ‘private realm of family life which the state cannot enter,’ that \nhas  been  afforded  both  substantive  and  procedural  protection[s]”  under  our \nConstitution.   Smith  v.  Org.  of  Foster  Fams.  for  Equal.  &  Reform,  431  U.S.  816,  842 \n(1977).  The Final Rule unduly interferes with these protections.  \nThe Department’s actions are arbitrary and capricious. \n   The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the \npublic and their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. \n788, 796 (1992).  When promulgating a rule, the agency must “‘reasonably consider[] the \nrelevant issues’ and factors” bearing on the analysis, see Advocs. for Highway & Auto Safety \nv. FMCSA, 41 F.4th 586, 595 (D.C. Cir. 2022), and must draw “rational connection[s] between \nthe facts found and the choice made.”  Id.  (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  Any agency action must be “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021); see \nMichigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015).  \n  To keep agencies under the Executive branch’s control accountable, courts are directed \nto set aside agency actions if they are “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \nsee also The Federalist No. 78, at 380 (Alexander Hamilton) (Dover ed., 2014) (“There is no \nposition which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, \ncontrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void.”).  Under this \nnarrow standard of review, “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency,” \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513 (2009), but instead is to assess only \nwhether the decision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there \nhas been a clear error of judgment.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.

Dep’t of Transp., 47 F.3d 794, 801-02 (6th Cir. 1995) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)).  An agency acts in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it (1) “has relied on \nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider”; (2) “entirely fail[s] to consider an \nimportant aspect of the [regulatory] problem”; (3) “offer[s] an explanation for” its conduct \n“that runs counter to the evidence before” it; or (4) reaches a determination that “is so \nimplausible…it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or…agency expertise.”  State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \n  The plaintiff-States claim that the Department spurns its obligation to offer a “reasoned \nexplanation” for departing from its longstanding view on the meaning of “sex” in Title IX.  \nSee Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016) (“Agencies are free to \nchange their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.”); \nMeister v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 623 F.3d 363, 371 (6th Cir. 2010) (It is an “elemental principle \nof administrative law that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations” unless an agency \ndutifully follows established rulemaking procedures for amending them).    \n  The Court’s analysis again returns to Bostock, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  The Department \nasserts that there is not “a ‘long-standing construction’ of the term ‘sex’ in Title IX to mean \n‘biological sex.’”  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 41537.  But this argument is severely undermined by \nthe series of congressional amendments and agency regulations since the statute’s enactment \nthat consistently have construed “sex” as a male-female binary.  Indeed, past regulations from \nthe Department are direct evidence that a definition has been in place.  The Department’s own \n- 67 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 68 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2063\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking even declared that it “now believes that its prior position (i.e., \nthat Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity) is at odds with Title IX’s text and purpose and the \nreasoning of the Bostock Court and other courts to have considered the issue in recent years—\nboth before and after Bostock.”  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390 (proposed \nJuly  12,  2022)  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R.  §  106).   Disagreement  with  its  own  past \ninterpretation constitutes a concession that a longstanding interpretation indeed has existed.  \n  The Department’s changed position through the Final Rule is based on the Supreme \nCourt’s  decision  in  Bostock,  which  interpreted  the  scope  of  Title  VII’s  protections  for \nemployees facing discrimination.  590 U.S. at 645.  The Department argues that the phrase \n“because of sex” in Title VII and “on the basis of sex” in Title IX mean the same thing, so \nBostock’s analysis concerning discrimination controls.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33806-07.  Although \nTitle VII shares some similarity to Title IX, it is arbitrary to rely on Bostock’s reasoning as a \nsource of support for upending a term’s meaning when the text, structure, purpose, and history \nof the statutes vary considerably.  See Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. \n2021).    \n  The Supreme Court used no small amount of ink clarifying what that decision did not \nmean as it did in explaining its significance:  \nAs judges we possess no special expertise or authority to declare for ourselves \nwhat a self-governing people should consider just or wise.  And the same \njudicial humility that requires us to refrain from adding to statutes requires us to \nrefrain from diminishing them.  What are these consequences anyway?  The \nemployers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other federal \nor state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.  And, under Title VII itself, they \nsay  sex-segregated  bathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  dress  codes  will  prove \n- 68 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 69 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2064\nunsustainable after our decision today.  But none of these other laws are before \nus; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their \nterms, and we do not prejudge any such question today.  Under Title VII, too, \nwe do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the \nkind. \n \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 681.  Based on this express disclaimer, it is suspect that the Department \nbases its explanation for changing its interpretation of a term––again, whose meaning has been \nunchanged since the statute was enacted––by relying on reasoning that the highest court said \nwas inapplicable.    \n  Even more, the Sixth Circuit has explained that “the Court in Bostock was clear on the \nnarrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to Title VII itself.  The [Supreme] \nCourt noted that ‘none of’ the many laws that might be touched by their decision were before \nthem and that they ‘do not prejudge any such question today.’”  Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., \n988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681-82).  As a result, the Sixth \nCircuit properly concluded that “Bostock extends no further than Title VII.”  Id; see also \nSkrmetti, 83 F.4th at 484 (holding that Bostock’s reasoning “applies only to Title VII.”).  This \nCourt dutifully takes the Sixth Circuit at its word.  Ultimately, there is little reason in the \nDepartment’s  purportedly  “reasoned  explanation”  for  departing  from  its  longstanding \ninterpretation of sex as a binary construct because Bostock did not expand the meaning of “sex” \nwithin Title IX.  The Final Rule’s mistaken reliance on this decision simply led the Department \nto a determination implausible to fathom by reasonable observers.  \n  The Department’s additional justifications for changing its interpretation of “sex” are \narbitrary and capricious, as well.  See Del. Dep’t of Nat. Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, 785 \nF.3d 1, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  The Final Rule acknowledges that the gender-\nidentity mandate conflicts with several provisions of Title IX, which expressly permit sex-\n- 69 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 70 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2065\nbased segregation in certain facilities and activities.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33818.  It also identifies \npermissible sex-separation in “living facilities” and the exceptions in 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1)-\n(9)––such as institutions whose primary purpose is for military training, social fraternities, and \nsororities––to  justify  omitting  such  facilities  and  programs  from  its  gender-identity \nmandate.  20 U.S.C. § 1686; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816, 33818-19.  At the same time, the \nDepartment arbitrarily applies its gender-identity mandate to bathrooms, toilets, and showers, \neven though existing regulations allow separation based on sex in those places.  Rather than \npause at how reading the term “sex” to include gender identity interferes with other portions \nof  Title  IX’s  general  scheme,  the  Department  says  these  exceptions  to  Title  IX’s \n“nondiscrimination mandate” indicate that schools can lawfully inflict more than de minimis \ndiscriminatory injury on students in the circumstances covered.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816, \n33818-19.  In essence, the Final Rule accommodates a reality in which student housing \nremains sex-segregated while students are free to choose the bathrooms and locker rooms they \nuse based on gender identity.  Of course, the latter would render the purpose of former obsolete \nin  terms  of  the  privacy  interests  Congress  sought  to  protect  by  permitting  sex-based \nsegregation in sensitive areas where separation has been traditional.   \n  Although there is obvious tension between longstanding regulations and the Final Rule, \nthe Department fails to address whether a recipient institution may require gender verifying \ndocumentation for participation in certain activities and programs that it may not require for \ntoilets, locker rooms, showers, classes, and other purposes.  Nor does it instruct schools how \nto determine whether certain spaces—like toilets and showers in the hall of a dorm complex—\nfall  within  “housing”  facilities  that  can  exclude  by  sex,  or  “bathroom”  facilities  that \ncannot.  See generally 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816-17, 33820-21.   \n- 70 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 71 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2066\n  Beyond  the  logic  that  seemingly  distorts  previous  congressional  and  regulatory \npurposes in allowing educational institutions to segregate certain places based on sex, the \nDepartment likewise fails to identify a rational basis for allowing activities associated with the \nAmerican Legion’s Girls and Boys State programs to restrict participation based on sex, see \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(7), while requiring schools to allow males identifying as females to \nparticipate in sexual education classes for females.  As the States emphasize, “[t]he Final Rule \nmakes no attempt to explain why allowing recipients to enforce sex-separate father-son or \nmother-daughter  activities  and  not  sex-separate  sexual-education  classes  or  sex-separate \nchoruses is logically consistent.”  [Record No. 1, ¶ 150]    \n  Absent  too  is  any  material  explanation  for  why  the  Department’s  “longstanding \nathletics regulations” support continuing to allow arbitrary enforcement of sex-separate sports \nbut the equally “longstanding” regulations governing bathrooms and locker rooms no longer \nmerit the same treatment.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33817.  In effect, the Department leaves in place \ncertain regulations allowing schools to maintain covered sex-segregated practices.  89 Fed. \nReg. at 33818-19.  But the Final Rule then specifies that schools may no longer apply the \nregulations’ allowance for sex-separation against males who identify as females or females \nwho identify as males.  Id.  It seems obvious that the Department simply failed to consider \nthese contradictory aspects when promulgating the Final Rule.  \n  As a general matter, courts cannot uphold an administrative decision that fails to build \na logical bridge between the agency action and the expected outcomes within the broader area \nthe agency seeks to regulate based on contradictions or missing premises.  See Louisiana v. \nUnited States Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 469 (5th Cir. 2024).  After all, “[t]he reviewing \ncourt should not attempt itself to make up for . . . deficiencies” in the agency’s reasoning and \n- 71 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 72 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2067\n“may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not \ngiven.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Without a clearly articulated explanation regarding why \ncertain parts of an educational institution’s campus and activities must comply with the Final \nRule’s “gender identity” mandate while others do not, the agency’s contradictory reasoning \nconstitutes a level of rulemaking arbitrariness prohibited by the APA.   \n  And of serious concern, the Department has not adequately accounted for the potential \nrisks posed to student and faculty safety that were raised by states, educators, and parents \nduring the notice and comment period.  Educational institutions at every level have long \nprovided sex-separated facilities—including locker rooms, restrooms, and student housing—\nto protect individuals on campus and ensure that basic privacy expectations are met.  The \nprivate characteristics of these places render them susceptible to abuse by bad actors.  Public \nrestrooms and locker rooms, for example, have long been designed with isolating features to \ndeliberately obstruct sightlines, limit entrances and exits, and conceal from most forms of \nsurveillance.  Individuals using these facilities are not always fully clothed, and the potential \nfor malfeasance is apparent.  \n  But the Final Rule ignores significant evidence offered by commenters regarding the \nsafety and privacy interests at stake.  Tennessee, for example, tendered a comment identifying \nnumerous instances of males attacking females in public restrooms that were designated for \nfemales only.  [Record No. 1-3, p. 11]  In Tennessee’s view, the new rules would further enable \nsuch conduct, as men and boys could then enter restrooms designated for females without \nrestriction.  Additionally, girls and women may be subjected to voyeurism against which they \nwould  have  little  recourse  because  male  perpetrators  could  enter  and  remain  in  spaces \ntraditionally reserved for women.  Id.   While Tennessee acknowledged that such activity may \n- 72 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 73 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2068\noccur with or without sex-segregated spaces, the potential for such abuse increases when boys \nand men can enter public spaces where girls and women are at their most vulnerable.  Id.  \n  Ultimately, the law requires the Department to identify “the most critical factual \nmaterial … used to support” its new rules before they are finalized, specifically for the purpose \nof “expos[ing]” such material “to refutation” in the public comment process.  See Chamber of \nCom. of U.S. v. SEC, 443 F.3d 890, 900 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing \nServ. Orgs., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 745 F.2d 677, 684 (D.C. Cir. \n1984)).  But even where the heightened opportunity for sexual misconduct and other nefarious \nactivity is so obvious, the Department similarly declined to provide any credible empirical \nanalysis supporting its new regulation.  Instead, it simply says it “does not agree” with \ncommenters who allege there is evidence that transgender students pose a safety risk to other \nstudents.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33820.  Surely, more is required than a categorical dismissal of \nserious concerns such as these.  \n  As a practical note, ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes \ndeprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities.  In intimate spaces \nlike bathrooms and locker rooms, students retain “a significant privacy interest in their \nunclothed  bodies.”   Brannum  v.  Overton  Cnty.  Sch.  Bd.,  516  F.3d  489,  494,  496  (6th \nCir.  2008).  This necessarily includes “the right to shield one’s body from exposure to viewing \nby the opposite sex.”  Id.  After all, in the words of former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the \nintegration of an all-male military institution “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary \nto afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.”  United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996).  This interest in protecting bodily privacy is \nsex-specific because of—not in spite of—the different male and female anatomies.  See id. at \n- 73 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 74 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2069\n533 (“Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: ‘[T]he two sexes \nare not fungible.’”) (quoting Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946)); see also \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 73 (2001) (Scalia, J.) (“The difference between men and women \nin relation to the birth process is a real one, and the principle of equal protection does not forbid \nCongress to address the problem at hand in a manner specific to each.”); Ryan T. Anderson, \nNeither Androgyny Nor Stereotypes: Sex Differences and the Difference They Make, 24 Tex. \nRev.  L.  &  Pol.  211,  218  (2019)  (“No  one  finds  it  particularly  difficult—let  alone \ncontroversial—to identify male and female members of the bovine species or the canine \nspecies.  It’s only recently, and only in the human species, that the very concept of sex has \nbecome convoluted and controversial.”).  To reiterate, the Department says only that it “does \nnot agree.”  \n  But at a minimum, students of both sexes would experience violations of their bodily \nprivacy by students of a different sex if the Final Rule became effective.  See Fortner v. \nThomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (recognizing that “most people have ‘a special \nsense of privacy in their genitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people \nof the other sex may be especially demeaning and humiliating.’”); Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ \nAss’n, 489 U.S. 602, 626 (1989) (“[E]xecretory function[s are] traditionally shielded by great \nprivacy.”); Grimm v. Glouster Co. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 633 (4th Cir. 2020) (Neimeyer, J., \ndissenting)  (“[C]ourts  have  long  recognized”  that  persons’  bodily  privacy  interests  are \n“significantly heightened when persons of the opposite biological sex are present.”) (collecting \ncases).  And as the States emphasize, the risk of “inappropriate sexual behavior” toward other \nstudents would certainly be heightened too.  See Doe v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 35 F.4th 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2022) (addressing allegations of students taking advantage \n- 74 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 75 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2070\nof  semi-private  school  spaces,  including  bathrooms,  to  engage  in  “unwelcome  sexual \ncontact”).  \n  Nonetheless, despite society’s enduring recognition of biological differences between \nthe sexes, as well as an individual’s basic right to bodily privacy, the Final Rule mandates that \nschools permit biological men into women’s intimate spaces, and women into men’s, within \nthe educational environment based entirely on a person’s subjective gender identity.  This \nresult is not only impossible to square with Title IX but with the broader guarantee of education \nprotection for all students.  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 73 (“To fail to acknowledge even our most \nbasic biological differences . . . risks making the guarantee of equal protection superficial, and \nso disserving it.”).    \n  Ultimately, the Department’s failure to provide any concrete, contradictory data to the \nconcerns raised by the States, parents, and educators renders it is difficult to fathom how it \ndetermined that “the benefits” of the new regulations “far outweigh [their] estimated costs.” \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41547 (proposed July 12, 2022) (to be codified at \n34 C.F.R. § 106).  This miscalculation is underscored by the fact that officials seemingly failed \nto seriously account for the possibility that abolishing sex-separated facilities would likely \nincrease the incidence of crime and deter large swaths of the public from using public \naccommodations altogether.   Id.    \n  Beyond  the  student-to-student  dynamic,  the  Final  Rule  requires  that  nearly  “any \nperson” who enters an educational campus would be allowed to use sex-separate facilities \nconsistent with his or her internal sense of gender identity.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33816.  Yet, the \nDepartment does not explain how a school can continue to “make and enforce rules that protect \n- 75 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 76 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2071\nall students’ safety and privacy,” while abiding by the Final Rule’s requirement of allowing \nany person unfettered, unverified access to facilities for the opposite sex.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n33820.  Notably, it “declines . . . to require” funding recipients to “provide gender-neutral or \nsingle-occupancy  facilities,”  in  part  because  it  “would  likely  carry  significant  cost \nimplications.”  Id.  At the same time, the Department also fails to acknowledge that many \nschools  across  the  country  have  responded  to  non-federal  gender-identity  mandates  by \nbuilding separate facilities for individuals who do not wish to encounter members of the \nopposite sex.  Id.  Nor does the Department consider cost implications that recipients would \nincur by restructuring other facilities to comply with the Final Rule’s requirements to modify \ncertain facilities for accommodating those with transgender status merely weeks in advance of \nthe Final Rule’s effective date.  Id.  \n  It is an inescapable conclusion based on the foregoing discussion that the Department \nhas effectively ignored the concerns of parents, teachers, and students who believe that the \nFinal Rule endangers basic privacy and safety interests.  See Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, \n575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (providing that an agency must “consider and respond to significant \ncomments received during the [limited] period for public comment”).  Rather than address the \nevidence provided by  the plaintiff-States and others during the commenting period, the \nDepartment throws its figurative hands in the air and says, “too bad.”  But as the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has underscored, “bare acknowledgement” of possible \nissues a rule will create “is no substitute for reasoned consideration,” especially when the \nregulated subject is one of extraordinary consequence.  Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 \nF.4th 461, 473 (5th Cir. 2024).  The Department has not identified significant evidence \nindicating that its motivations here are rooted more in sound considerations accounting for the \n- 76 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 77 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2072\nserious privacy and safety interests than in the political preferences of an outcome-oriented \nrule.  Based on this analysis, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.    \nThe Proposed Athletics Rule \n  The plaintiffs discuss girls’ and women’s athletics extensively and A.C.’s portion of \nthe Intervenor Complaint is largely focused on this topic.  Title IX’s implementing regulations \nprovide that, in general, a person may not be discriminated against with respect to athletics and \n“no  recipient  shall  provide  [athletics]  separately”  on  the  basis  of  sex.   34  C.F.R.  § \n106.41(a).  However, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b) provides that recipients may operate or sponsor \nseparate athletic teams for members of each sex “where selection for such teams is based upon \ncompetitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.”  The Programs and Facilities Rule \nleaves § 106.41(b) intact, as 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) excepts this provision from the de \nminimis harm standard.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33816-17 (stating that “§ 106.31(a)(2) does not \napply to male and female athletic teams a recipient offers under § 106.41(b)”).16    \n  West Virginia enacted the “Save Women’s Sports Act” in 2021 to address its concerns \nregarding biological males who may seek to participate in women’s sports.  W. Va. Code § \n18-2-25d.  The law essentially provides that athletic teams designated for females shall not be \nopen to students whose biological sex determined at birth is male.  Id.  Shortly after the passage \nof that law, B.P.J. filed suit in federal court in West Virginia. B.P.J. by Jackson v. West Virginia \nState Bd. of Educ., 550 F. Supp. 3d 347 (S.D. W. Va. 2021).  B.P.J. alleged, inter alia, that the \n \n16  The intervenor Plaintiffs argue persuasively that Final Rule allows schools to maintain \nathletics teams that are designated for males or females only but requires them to allow \nstudents to participate on the team that is consistent with their self-reported gender identity.  \n[Record No. 99, p. 8]  As with many aspects of the rule, educational institutions would struggle \nto understand their compliance obligations.   \n- 77 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 78 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2073\nSave Women’s Sports Act violated Title IX, as applied to B.P.J, who had received puberty \nblockers and hormone therapy as treatment for gender dysphoria.    \n  B.P.J.  was  allowed  to  compete  against  A.C.  in  middle  school  track  and  field \ncompetitions because of court-imposed injunctions during that litigation.  Approximately two \nmonths ago, B.P.J. prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, \nwhich held that the Act violated Title IX as applied to B.P.J.  See B.P.J. by Jackson v. West \nVirginia State Bd. of Educ., 98 F.4th 542, 562 (4th Cir. 2024).  West Virginia Attorney General \nPatrick Morrisey has indicated the state will file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United \nStates Supreme Court.  [Record No. 72, ¶ 80]  \n  The  Department  has  issued  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  titled, \n“Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial  Assistance:  Sex-Related  Eligibility  Criteria  for  Male  and  Female  Athletic \nTeams.”  88 Fed. Reg. 22860 (Apr. 13, 2023) (“the Proposed Athletics Rule”).  If the rule goes \ninto effect, it will alter 34 C.F.R. § 106.41 dramatically as it will provide that public schools \nmay not categorically ban transgender students from playing sports consistent with their \ngender identity.17  Id. at 22,871.    \n  The plaintiff-States allege that, if the Programs and Facilities Rule goes into effect, its \ngender-identity mandate will “invalidate scores of States’ and schools’ sex-separated sports \npolicies.”  [Record No. 1, ¶ 12]  While that may be the inevitable consequence, until the \n \n17  The  Department  has  stated  that  limitations  based  on  “more  targeted  criteria, \nsubstantially related to sport, level of competition, and grade or education level, could be \npermissible.”  89 Fed.

See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b).  To the extent A.C. (or any other plaintiff) challenges the \nProposed Athletic Rule, the Court lacks jurisdiction to evaluate the claim because the proposed \nrule does not constitute a final agency action.  See Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. \nF.T.C., 710 F.2d 1165, 1170 (6th Cir. 1983) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 551(13)).  \nV.  Irreparable Injury \n \na.  Compliance Costs \n \nThe Final Rule provides cost estimates of implementing the new regulations based on \n“feedback provided by stakeholders in listening sessions and review of comments received” \nin response to the proposed rulemaking.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33866-74.  The Department has \nprovided various cost estimates including Year 1 training, investigations and adjudications, \nand recordkeeping.  Id.  The plaintiff-States contend the Department has underestimated these \ncosts, as well as the uptick in Title IX complaints that will result from implementation of the \nFinal Rule.  \nThe  States  presented  the  testimony  of  Christy  Ballard,  General  Counsel  for  the \nTennessee Department of Education (“TDOE”).  TDOE oversees Tennessee’s local public \nschool districts and administers their federal funding.  While TDOE does not control public \nschools on a day-to-day basis, it provides guidance and oversight in ensuring their compliance \nwith  state  and  federal  laws.   TDOE  is  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  Final  Rule  and \ndetermining what policy changes, student handbook changes, and training requirements will \nbe necessary within Tennessee’s public school system to comply with the Final Rule.    \n- 79 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 80 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2075\nBallard testified that the Final Rule’s time of publication—the end of April—is a very \nbusy time within the school system because that is when schools administer state and federally \nrequired standardized testing.  These tests inform accountability for school districts, individual \nschools, and teachers.  They also determine whether some elementary school children will \nrequire supplementary reading instruction during the summer.  \nIn Tennessee, local school districts develop their own unique policies based on the size \nand type of school and the community values in the area.18  Before a school can adopt a policy, \nthe school board must draft the policy and conduct a public meeting after giving adequate \npublic  notice.   Ballard  testified  that  most  school  boards  have  meetings  in  June  and \nAugust.  Additionally, since school is out of session from June to August, most school staff \nare not working during that time.  To implement new policies, staff must prepare and print new \nstudent handbooks.  Based on these facts, Ballard believes it would be very difficult to ensure \nthat any new policies are in place by August 1.   \nBallard also testified that the burdens imposed by the Final Rule are more onerous than \nthose of a typical update to a school’s policy or procedure.  She acknowledged that schools \nupdate their policies based on new laws every year, but they are “usually not based on hundreds \nof pages of a rule.”  Ballard noted that most school districts are unlikely to have the expertise \n \n18  For instance, during cross-examination of Ballard, the Department asked the Court to \ntake judicial notice of the non-discrimination statement of the Metro Nashville Public Schools, \nwhich provides: “Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) does not discriminate on the \nbasis of race, religion, creed, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, \ncolor, age and/or disability in admission to, access to or operation of its programs, services or \nactivities and provides access to the Boy Scouts and other designated youth groups. MNPS \ndoes not discriminate in its hiring or employment practices.”  Available at Handbook - Policies \nand Procedures - Metro Nashville Public Schools (mnps.org) (last accessed June 12, 2024).  \n \n- 80 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 81 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2076\nin-house to fully understand the rule and will likely require the assistance of outside counsel.  \n  Ballard noted that the Final Rule requires training for anyone who might work on a \nschool campus when students are present.  Tennessee’s public school system serves just under \none million students and employs approximately 130,000 people.  The required training varies \naccording to the individual’s particular role within the institution, so completing this training \nwill require extensive planning.  Ballard also anticipates that the training will be expensive, \ncausing the states to incur registration fees, travel costs, and payment for substitute teachers to \ncover teacher absences.    \nThe Department predicts that recipients of federal funds will see a ten percent increase \nin Title IX complaints and investigations under the Final Rule.  Ballard testified that TDOE is \nalready  very  busy  addressing  all  matters  of  civil  rights,  truancy,  and  student \ndiscipline.  Accordingly, she contends, an increased number of Title IX complaints will take \nattention away from these matters or will require the TDOE to hire additional staff.  \nBallard’s sentiments are echoed by Shaundraya Hersey, Assistant General Counsel for \nCivil Rights for the Tennessee Department of Education, and Mark Fulks, University Counsel \nand Chief Compliance Officer for East Tennessee University.  [Record Nos. 92-1; 92-2]  And \nbecause recipients of federal funds must comply with the new regulations before the next \nschool year begins, the states expect to incur compliance costs in the spring and summer of \n2024.  [See Thompson Declaration, Record No. 19-3; Mason Declaration, Record No. 19-4; \nDeuth  Declaration,  Record  No.  19-8;  Garrison  Declaration,  Record  No.  19-9;  Coons \nDeclaration, Record No. 19-11; Trice Declaration, Record No. 19-12.]    \nIrreparable harm is generally defined as harm that cannot be fully compensated by \nmoney damages.  See Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Gov’t, 305 F.3d 566, 578 \n- 81 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 82 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2077\n(6th Cir. 2002).  The States note that, if the preliminary injunction is not granted but they \nultimately prevail in this lawsuit, they will not be able to recoup the compliance expenses from \nthe Department due to its sovereign immunity.  See Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, \n556 (6th Cir. 2023) (noting that the federal government’s sovereign immunity makes such \nexpenses unrecoverable) (citing Wages & White Lion Invs., LLC v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 \n(5th Cir. 2021)); FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (observing that, “[a]bsent a waiver \nof sovereign immunity, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over claims for money \ndamages against the United States and its agencies.”).    \nSome circuits have concluded that compliance costs do not qualify as irreparable harm \nbecause they are an ordinary result of new government regulation.  See New York v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Education, 477 F. Supp. 3d 279, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  But the Sixth Circuit has declined \nto hold so broadly, concluding that it depends on the circumstances of the case.  Biden, 57 \nF.4th at 556 (noting that “the peculiarity and size of a harm affects its weight in the equitable \nbalance, not whether it should enter the calculus at all”).  The plaintiffs have sufficiently \ndemonstrated that the compliance costs here are extraordinary due to the sweeping policy \nchanges they are required to implement and the short timeframe in which they must do so.  And \nbecause the recovery of these costs would necessarily be barred, this factor weighs in favor of \na finding of irreparable harm.  See Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220-21 \n(1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (“[C]omplying with a regulation later held invalid almost \nalways produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”).  \nb.  Loss of Federal Funding \nThe States next cite the federal funding they stand to lose if they do not comply with \nthe Final Rule when it goes into effect on August 1.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  The States \n- 82 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 83 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2078\npresented  the  testimony  of  David  Thurman,  State  Budget  Director  for  the  Tennessee \nDepartment of Finance and Administration (F&A).  Thurman explained how Tennessee’s \nyearly budget is developed, including a budget for the Department of Education.  Thurman \nreported that the education budget for fiscal year 2023 was approximately 8 billion dollars, \nwith approximately 1.8 billion dollars comprising federal funds, and approximately 1.5 billion \ndollars coming from the United States Department of Education.19    \nThurman testified that agencies submit budget requests for the upcoming fiscal year in \nSeptember.  Following internal hearings with agencies and public hearings with the governor \nand the agencies, the governor makes a recommendation to the legislature around the end of \nJanuary or the beginning of February.  At that point, local governments and school districts \nbegin their planning process because they get an idea of what funds they will have for the \nupcoming  school  year.   This  allows  them  to  begin  considering  resources  and  hiring \ndecisions.    \nThurman testified that, given this timeline, it is important to have a sense of certainty \nregarding the amount of federal funding that is available for the state Department of Education \nand local school districts.  If federal funding is lost after the budget is already set, there is very \nlittle flexibility to adjust.  In other words, when money is allocated for a specific program, \nlocal school districts cannot use the money for another purpose.  Thurman also explained that \na loss of federal funding would disproportionately impact low-income or other high-risk \nstudents.    \n \n19  The remainder of federal funds came from the United States Department of Agriculture, \nwhich funded Tennessee’s school nutrition program. \n \n- 83 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 84 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2079\nSome programs, such as special education and child nutrition, are mandated regardless \nof funding.  Thurman testified that if federal funding was lost, it would be impossible to replace \nthose funds in one fiscal year based on normal growth of the state budget.  Without federal \nfunding, the state would likely have to look for state funds by defunding other programs.   \nSteven Gentile, Executive Director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, \nalso testified at the preliminary injunction hearing.  Gentile testified that Tennessee’s various \npublic  institutions  of  higher  learning  receive  federal  funding  to  support  their  education \nprograms—in fiscal year 2023, they received approximately 1.5 billion dollars in federal \nsupport.   This  money  is  used  for  purposes  such  as  financial  aid,  scholarships,  and \nresearch.  Gentile testified that a loss of federal funds would have a devastating effect on \ninstitutions of higher education in Tennessee, as enrollment inevitably would decline, and \nresearch  would  be  adversely  impacted.   Consistent  with  Thurman’s  statements,  Gentile \ntestified that higher education institutions plan their budgets well in advance of the school year \nand rely on the expectation that they will receive federal funding.    \nThe plaintiff-States tendered declarations from various education officials describing \nthe likely impact the loss of federal funds would have on their schools.  James Bryson, \nCommissioner of the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration, reports that 17.6 \npercent of the Tennessee Department of Education’s total annual budget for fiscal year 2022-\n2023 came from federal funds.  [Record No. 19-2]  Christopher Thacker, General Counsel to \nthe Kentucky Office of Attorney General, reports that over 17 percent of Kentucky’s education \nfunding comes from the federal government.20  [Record No. 19-7]  Derek Deuth, the Chief \n \n20  This value appears to reference the 2021-2022 school year.  The information for 2022-\n2023 produces a value of approximately 14.4 percent.

[Record  No.  19-\n8]  Michael Maul, the Director of the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget, reports \nthat federal funds comprised 12.1 percent of the total spending for public education programs \nin Virginia in 2023.  [Record No. 19-10]  Melanie Purkey is the Assistant Superintendent for \nthe  Division  of  Federal  Programs  and  Support  at  the  West  Virginia  Department  of \nEducation.  [Record No. 19-14]  She reports that 26.63 percent of West Virginia’s total annual \nexpenditures for public educational programs and activities in fiscal year 2023 came from \nfederal funds.  Finally, Jonathan Blanton, the First Assistant Attorney General for the Office \nof the Ohio Attorney General, reports that Ohio received over $5.2 billion in funding from the \nUnited States Department of Education in 2023.  [Record No. 19-16]    \nThe plaintiff-States’ schools use these federal funds for a variety of purposes including: \nproviding supplemental educational support, materials, and enrichment for students, providing \nnon-academic support for students; providing professional learning opportunities for teachers; \nproviding technology for students; providing food and nutrition for students; supporting \nspecial  education  programs;  supporting  low-income  students,  and  providing  support  for \nEnglish learners, homeless students, and students with disabilities.  Public higher education \ninstitutions use federal funds for student loans, scholarships, research and services, veterans’ \naffairs, and for funding for historically Black colleges and universities.    \n \nTransparency,  Kentucky  Dep’t  of  Education, \nhttps://www.kyschoolreportcard.com/organization/20?year=2023#financial_transparency \n(last visited June 1, 2024). \n- 85 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 86 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2081\nIf the preliminary injunction is not granted and the States do not comply with the new \nregulations, they risk losing these substantial amounts of funds.  Various officials’ declarations \nindicate that, without federal funding, the plaintiff States will be forced to either eliminate \neducational programming or seek alternative funding.  Further, the programming would likely \nhave to be paused while alternative funding is being sought.  David Thurman’s testimony \nindicates that, at least with respect to Tennessee, budget planning would be difficult in the \nabsence of injunctive relief.    \nThe loss of these funds undoubtedly would have a devastating impact on the plaintiff-\nStates’ public schools and their students.  And while the Department of Education must seek \nvoluntary compliance before terminating any funds that are given to states under Title IX, “the \nStates’ injury as alleged has immediate effect on the States’ ordering of their own affairs.”  See \nState of Tenn. v. Dep’t of Educ., --F.3d--, 2024 WL 2984295, at *20 (6th Cir. June 14, 2024) \n(observing that plaintiffs normally are not required “to bet the farm by taking the violative \naction before testing the law).21   \nc.  Interference with States’ Sovereign Interests \nStates have compelling interests in enforcing their own laws, particularly with respect \nto matters like education, which have traditionally been reserved to the states.  See Tennessee \nv. United States Dep’t of Education, 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 840-41 (2022) (citing Thompson v. \n \n21  During the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for the Department suggested \nthrough cross-examination that the Department of Education has never terminated a recipient’s \nfunding in response to a suspected Title IX violation.  But even if this assertion is accurate, it \nis no guarantee that the Department will not do so in the future.  See State of Tenn., et al. v. \nDep’t of Educ., et al., --F.4th.--, 2024 WL 2984295, at *5 n.8 (June 14, 2024) (“Courts are \nrightly skeptical about taking a party at its word that it will not enforce something when \nenforcement is within its discretion.”). \n- 86 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 87 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2082\nDeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020)).  See also Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579 n.17 \n(2018) (observing that “the inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable \nharm on the State”).  In many instances, the Final Rule conflicts with the plaintiff-States’ own \nduly enacted laws.  See, e.g., Tenn. Code. Ann § 49-2-802; Ky. Rev. Stat. 158.189.21  But \ndisplacement of state statute by federal law is not required.  Instead, irreparable harm exists \nwhen a federal agency’s action places a state’s “sovereign interests and public policies at \nstake.”  Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 841 (quoting Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, \n1227-28 (10th Cir. 2001)).  The plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the new regulations \npose a significant, immediate threat to public policies that have traditionally been left to state \ndetermination.   \nd.  Citizen Harms \nFinally, the plaintiff-States contend that the Final Rule would cause their citizens to \nendure a variety of irremediable harms including violations of their bodily privacy by students \nof the opposite sex.  As previously discussed, States can defend their quasi-sovereign and \nsovereign  interests,  such  as  the  safety  of  their  populations,  in  court  against  the  federal \ngovernment.  The Court has no doubts that individual privacy is an important concern for the \nplaintiff-States, and the Department undoubtedly dismissed many of these concerns raised by \nthe parents, teachers, and other commenters.  To the extent the States seek to ensure the safety \nof their populations, the claims against the federal government may proceed.  See Biden, 23 \nF.4th at 596 (discussing states’ quasi-sovereign interests). \nTurning to the Intervenor plaintiffs, Christian Educators has sufficiently alleged such \nclaims to establish irreparable injury.  Irreparable injury is presumed when a moving party \nshows “that a constitutional right is being threatened or impaired.”  Am.

Loss of First Amendment freedoms, in particular, even if \njust for a minimal period of time, “unquestionably constitutes irreparably injury.”  Connection \nDistrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998).   \nVI.  Substantial Harm and the Public Interest \nThe third and fourth factors—the likely harm to others and the public interest—“merge \nwhen the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The \nSixth Circuit has repeatedly recognized that “the public interest lies in a correct application” \nof the law.  Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 252 (6th Cir. \n2006) (quoting Congregation Lubavitch v. City of Cincinnati, 923 F.2d 458, 460 (6th Cir. \n1991)).  The relevant regulations have been unchanged for approximately 50 years.  Therefore, \nit would be of relatively little harm to others to maintain the status quo pending the resolution \nof this lawsuit.    \nVII.  Scope of Relief \n The Department contends that, even if the Court grants a preliminary injunction, some \nof the challenged regulations may remain intact.  The undersigned, however, disagrees with \nthis assertion.  The Court starts with 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, which seeks to redefine the scope of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX.  It provides: “Discrimination on the basis of \nsex includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or \nrelated  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender  identity.”   For  the  reasons  previously \nexplained, the text and legislative history of Title IX do not permit a reading of “sex” that \nincludes sex stereotypes and gender identity.    \n- 88 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 89 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2084\nIt follows that 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 (Aug. 1, 2024) is invalid, as well.  It reads, in relevant \npart:   \nSex-based harassment prohibited by this part is a form of sex discrimination and \nmeans sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on \nthe bases described in § 106.10, that is: . . .  \n \n(2) Hostile environment harassment.  Unwelcome sex-based conduct that, based \non the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive \nand is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to \nparticipate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity (i.e., \ncreates a hostile environment).  Whether a hostile environment has been created \nis a fact-specific inquiry that includes consideration of the following:   \n \n \n(i) The degree to which the conduct affected the complainant’s ability to access \nthe recipient's education program or activity;  \n \n(ii) The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct;  \n \n(iii) The parties’ ages, roles within the recipient’s education program or activity, \nprevious interactions, and other factors about each party that may be relevant to \nevaluating the effects of the conduct;  \n \n(iv) The location of the conduct and the context in which the conduct occurred; \nand \n \n(v) Other sex-based harassment in the recipient’s education program or activity. \n. . . \n \n \n \nThis provision bases actionable sexual harassment on impermissible grounds identified \nin § 106.10.  If discrimination cannot arise from these statuses under Title IX, neither can \nsexual harassment.  See Foster v. Bd. Of Regents of Univ. of Mich., 982 F.3d 960 (6th Cir. \n2020) (noting that Title IX covers at least two types of discrimination—a school’s direct \ninterference with a student’s participation in an education program and a school’s deliberate \nindifference to known acts of student-on-student harassment).  \nFinally, 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) provides:  \n \nIn the limited circumstances in which Title IX or this part permits different \ntreatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry out such \ndifferent treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of \nsex by subjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, except as permitted \nby 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the corresponding regulations at §§ \n- 89 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 90 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2085\n106.12 through 106.15, 20 U.S.C. § 1686 and its corresponding regulation § \n106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b).  Adopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents  a  person  from  participating  in  an  education  program  or  activity \nconsistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de \nminimis harm on the basis of sex. \n \n \n \nThis regulation is arbitrary in the truest sense of the word.  As explained above, the \nDepartment has failed to demonstrate why recipients are allowed to inflict more than de \nminimis harm in some situations but not in others when there is no meaningful difference (e.g., \nliving facilities versus showers).    \nFurther,  as  previously  explained,  the  Department’s  rulemaking  was  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, resulting in a rule that is invalid in its entirety.    \nEach subsection in which these provisions appear contains a severability clause that \nprovides: “If any provision of this subpart or its application to any person, act, or practice is \nheld invalid, the remainder of the subpart or the application of its provisions to any person, act, \nor  practice  shall  not  be  affected  thereby.”   34  C.F.R.  §§  106.9;  106.16;  106.48.   The \nseverability  clause  has  little  impact  on  the  Court’s  analysis  because  the  impermissible \ndefinition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” in 34 C.F.R. §  106.10 permeates the \nremaining regulations.  Although it could potentially excise the portions of 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 \nthat make any reference to sex discrimination or sexual harassment, the Court is hesitant to do \nso when rulemaking is exclusively within the purview of the Executive Branch.  See Ayotte v. \nPlanned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006) (asking whether the legislature \nwould have “preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all”).    \nFinally, the Court recognizes prudential limitations to its determination.  The Sixth \nCircuit  has  cautioned  against  granting  nationwide  injunctions  against  the  federal \ngovernment.  See Tennessee v. Dep’t of Education, 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 842 n.18 (E.D. Tenn. \n- 90 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 91 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2086\nJuly 15, 2022) (citing Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 396 (6th Cir. 2022)) (Sutton, J., \nconcurring).  And clearly there are states that do not want this relief as evidenced by the \nproposed amicus curiae filing in this case.    \nThe Intervenor plaintiffs have asked the Court to waive any security requirement under \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, reporting that no security requirement attends \na stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705.  Rule 65 provides that the court may issue a preliminary injunction \n“only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs \nand  damages  sustained  by  any  party  found  to  have  been  wrongfully  enjoined  or \nrestrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  While Rule 65 appears to require a security bond, the Court \nhas discretion over whether to require the posting of security.  Moltan Co. v. Eagle-Pritcher \nIndus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171, 1176 (6th Cir. 1995).  Under the facts presented in this litigation, \nthe Court concludes that no security is necessary in this matter due, in large part, to the strength \nof the plaintiffs’ case and the strong public interest favoring the plaintiffs’ positions.  See id.; \nTennessee v. Dep’t of Education, 615 F.3d at 842.  \nVIII.  Conclusion \n  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was intended to level the playing field \nbetween men and women in education.  The statute tells us that no person shall be subjected \nto  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681.  However, the Department of Education \nseeks to derail deeply rooted law with a Final Rule that is set to go into effect on August 1, \n2024.   \n  At bottom, the Department would turn Title IX on its head by redefining “sex” to \ninclude “gender identity.”  But “sex” and “gender identity” do not mean the same thing.  The \n- 91 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 92 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2087\nDepartment’s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds \nits authority to promulgate regulations under that statute.  This Court is not persuaded by the \nDepartment’s reliance on the Supreme Court’s decision Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, \n590 U.S. 644 (2020)—a case that was explicitly limited to the  context of employment \ndiscrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n  The Final Rule also has serious First Amendment implications.  The rule includes a \nnew definition of sexual harassment which may require educators to use pronouns consistent \nwith a student’s purported gender identity rather than their biological sex.  Based on the \n“pervasive” nature of pronoun usage in everyday life, educators likely would be required to \nuse students’ preferred pronouns regardless of whether doing so conflicts with the educator’s \nreligious or moral beliefs.  A rule that compels speech and  engages in such viewpoint \ndiscrimination is impermissible. \n  Additionally, the Department’s actions with respect to this rulemaking are arbitrary and \ncapricious.  The Department fails to provide a reasoned explanation for departing from its \nlongstanding interpretations regarding the meaning of sex and provided virtually no answers \nto many of the difficult questions that arose during the public comment phase.  Notably, the \nDepartment does not provide a sufficient explanation for leaving regulations in place that \nconflict  with  the  new  gender-identity  mandate,  nor  does  it  meaningfully  respond  to \ncommentors’ concerns regarding risks posed to student and faculty safety.   \nBased on the foregoing analysis and discussion, it is hereby  \nORDERED as follows:  \n- 92 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 100   Filed: 06/17/24   Page: 93 of 93 - Page ID#:\n2088\n1.

      "text": "  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  1 \n \nPer Curiam  \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_________________ \nNo. 24A78  \n_________________ \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ET  AL. v.   \nLOUISIANA, ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n_________________ \nNo. 24A79  \n_________________ \nMIGUEL CARDONA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, \nET  AL. v. TENNESSEE,  ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[August 16, 2024]\n PER CURIAM. \n  The application for a partial stay presented to JUSTICE \nALITO in No. 24A78 and by him referred to the Court is \ndenied.  The application for a partial stay presented to  \nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH in No. 24A79 and by him referred to \nthe Court is denied. \n  The Department of Education recently issued a new rule \nimplementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.  The  rule  newly  defined  sex  discrimination  to\n“includ[e] discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, \n \nsex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual \norientation,  and  gender  identity.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  33886  \n(2024).\n  Several  States  and  other  parties  sought  preliminary \ninjunctions  against  the  new  rule,  arguing  among  other \nthings that the rule exceeded the bounds of the statutory\ntext enacted by Congress.  District Courts in Louisiana and \nKentucky  agreed  with  the  plaintiffs  and  preliminarily \nenjoined enforcement of the rule in the plaintiff States.  The  \n\n2  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nPer Curiam  \nCourts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits then \ndeclined to stay the injunctions in the interim period while \nthose  courts  consider  the  Government’s  appeals  of  the \npreliminary injunctions.\n  The Government has now filed emergency applications in \nthis  Court  seeking  partial  stays  of  the  preliminary \ninjunctions pending resolution of the appeals in the Fifth \nand Sixth Circuits.  The Court denies the Government’s  \napplications.\n  Importantly, all Members of the Court today accept that \nthe plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nas to three provisions of the rule, including the central \nprovision that newly defines sex discrimination to include \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender\nidentity.  But the Government argues (and the dissent  \nagrees) that those provisions should be severed and that the \nother provisions of the new rule should still be permitted to \ntake effect in the interim period while the Government’s \nappeals of the preliminary injunctions are pending in the \nCourts of Appeals.  The lower courts concluded otherwise \nbecause  the  new  definition  of  sex  discrimination  is  \nintertwined with and affects many other provisions of the \nnew rule. Those courts therefore concluded, at least at this  \npreliminary stage, that the allegedly unlawful provisions\nare not readily severable from the remaining provisions.  \nThe lower courts also pointed out the difficulty that schools \nwould face in determining how  to apply  the rule for a \ntemporary period with some provisions in effect and some \nenjoined. \n  In this emergency posture in this Court, the burden is on \nthe Government as applicant  to show, among other things, \na likelihood of success on its severability argument and that \nthe equities favor a stay.  On this limited record and in its  \nemergency applications, the Government has not provided \nthis Court a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ \ninterim conclusions that the three provisions found likely \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n   \nPer Curiam  \nto  be  unlawful  are  intertwined  with  and  affect  other \nprovisions of the rule.   Nor has the Government adequately \nidentified  which  particular  provisions,  if  any,  are \nsufficiently  independent  of  the  enjoined  definitional \nprovision  and  thus  might  be  able  to  remain  in  effect.   \nMoreover, related to the equities, the Sixth Circuit has\nalready  expedited  its  consideration  of  the  case  and \nscheduled oral argument for October.  The Court expects \nthat the Courts of Appeals will render their decisions with \nappropriate dispatch.  In light of all of the circumstances, \nthe Court denies the Government’s applications for partial \nstays. \nIt is so ordered.  \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  1 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., d iss enting in p art \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n_________________ \nNo. 24A78  \n_________________ \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ET  AL. v.   \nLOUISIANA, ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n_________________ \nNo. 24A79  \n_________________ \nMIGUEL CARDONA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, \nET  AL. v. TENNESSEE,  ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR STAY  \n[August 16, 2024]\n JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR,  with  whom  JUSTICE   KAGAN, \nJUSTICE GORSUCH, and JUSTICE JACKSON join, dissenting\nin part from the denial of applications for stays. \n  Respondents challenged a Department of Education rule \nimplementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.  Respondents contend that the rule unlawfully rede-\nfines sex discrimination; that it violates students’ and em-\nployees’ rights to bodily privacy and safety; and that its def-\ninition of hostile environment harassment is  inconsistent  \nwith the statute and violates the First Amendment.  Every\nMember of  the Court agrees respondents are entitled to in-\nterim relief as to three provisions of that Rule: 34 CFR \n§106.10 (2023) (defining sex discrimination), §106.31(a)(2) \n(prohibiting schools from preventing individuals from ac-\ncessing certain sex-separated spaces consistent with their \ngender identity), and §106.2’s definition of hostile environ-\nment harassment.  Respondents’ alleged injuries flow from \nthose three provisions. \n  Today, however, a majority of this Court leaves in place  \n\n2  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \npreliminary injunctions that bar the Government from en-\nforcing the entire rule—including provisions that bear no \napparent  relationship  to  respondents’  alleged  injuries.  \nThose injunctions are overbroad.  To be sure, this litigation \nis still unfolding, and respondents might eventually show\ninjuries from the other portions of the rule.  If so, those in-\njuries might merit further relief.   For now, on the briefing \nand record currently before us, I would stay the preliminary \ninjunctions except as to the three provisions above, in keep-\ning with the traditional principle of equitable remedies that \n“relief afforded [to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more bur-\ndensome than necessary to redress the complaining par-\nties.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979); see \nMadsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 765  \n(1994) (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than neces-\nsary to achieve its desired goals”). \nI \n  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States \nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a).  \nCongress charged the Department of Education with “issu-\ning rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability” to \n“effectuate” Title IX’s antidiscrimination mandate.  §1682.  \nPursuant to that authority, in April 2024, the Department \nissued an omnibus rule amending Title IX’s regulations, set \nto take effect nationwide on August 1, 2024.  See 89 Fed.  \nReg. 33474 (2024) (Rule).  The amended provisions of the\nRule cover a range of matters, most of which do not refer-\nence gender identity discrimination and went unmentioned \nby respondents.1  \n—————— \n1Those provisions include: a provision requiring access to lactation \n \nspaces and “reasonable modifications” for pregnant students, such as  re-\nstroom breaks, 89 Fed. Reg. 33888, 33895–33896 (to be codified in 34 \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  3 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n  Respondents claim they are harmed by three provisions\nof the Rule.  First, at 34 CFR §106.10, the Rule defines \n“[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex” to “includ[e] discrimi-\nnation on the basis of  sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and \ngender  identity.”  89  Fed.  Reg.  33886.  Second,  at  \n§106.31(a)(2), the Rule addresses Title IX’s application in \nsex-separated spaces.  89 Fed. Reg. 33887.  The Rule leaves  \nuntouched Title IX’s explicit recognition that schools may \ndifferentiate between students on the basis of sex in some \ncontexts, such as in assigning dormitories and creating ath-\nletic teams.2  Outside those statutory exceptions, however, \n—————— \nCFR §§106.40(b)(3)(v), 106.57); a provision affirming the legal rights of \nparents and guardians to act on behalf of complainants and respondents, \n89 Fed. Reg. 33885 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.6(g)); three provisions \naddressing schools’ obligations in  responding to claims implicating Title \nIX, including measures to assist impacted parties, employee-notification \nrequirements, Title IX coordinator duties, applicable grievance proce-\ndures, and protection of personally identifiable information, 89 Fed. Reg. \n33888–33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §§106.44, 106.45, 106.46); a pro-\nvision addressing schools’ obligations  to designate Title IX coordinators, \nand adopt and implement a nondiscrimination policy and grievance pro-\ncedures, 89 Fed. Reg. 33885–33886 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.8); a  \nprovision clarifying schools’ obligations with respect to retaliation, 89  \nFed. Reg. at 33896 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.71); a provision  clari-\nfying that the Department of Education’s Assistant Secretary of Civil \nRights will not deem a recipient to have violated the Title IX regulations \nsolely because the Assistant Secretary would have reached a different \ndecision in a particular complaint alleging  sex-based harassment,  89  \nFed. Reg.  at 33895 (to be codified in 34 CFR §106.47); and a provision \naddressing what pre-employment inquiries a school may make regarding \nan individual’s marital status and sex, 89 Fed. Reg. 33896 (to be codified \nin 34 CFR §106.60).  \n2Specifically, those contexts include membership in fraternities or so-\n \nrorities, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a)(6), separate living facilities, §1686, and ath-\nletic teams, Education Amendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 612.  The Depart-\nment explained in the Rule that neither §106.31(a)(2) nor anything else \nin the Rule addresses or alters existing requirements governing sex sep-\naration in athletics, which is the subject of a separate rulemaking.  89  \nFed. Reg. 33816–33817.  \n\n4  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n§106.31(a)(2) states that Title IX generally permits “differ-\nent treatment or separation on the basis of sex” only to the \nextent that such differential treatment or separation does \nnot “discriminat[e]. . . by subjecting a person to more than  \nde minimis harm.”  Section 106.31(a)(2) further provides\nthat a policy or practice that “prevents a person from par-\nticipating in an education program or activity consistent \nwith the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more \nthan de minimis harm on the basis of sex.”  (Emphasis \nadded.)  Sections 106.10 and 106.31(a)(2) are the only pro-\nvisions in the entire Rule that reference “gender identity.”   \n  Third, at 34 CFR §106.2, the Rule defines several terms, \nincluding “hostile environment harassment.”  89 Fed. Reg.  \n33884.  “Hostile environment harassment” is a prohibited \nform of sex discrimination that, as defined by the Rule, in-\nvolves “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively \noffensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or de-\nnies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the \nrecipient’s education program or activity (i.e., creates a hos-\ntile environment).”  Ibid.  Respondents do not object to\n§106.2’s definitions of other terms within the Rule, such as \n“complaint,” “disciplinary sanctions,” “elementary school,” \nand “student.”  \n  Two groups of States filed suits in two District Courts \nchallenging the new Rule as unlawful.3  They contend that \n—————— \n3One suit was brought by the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Mon-\n \ntana, and Idaho, joined by the Louisiana Department of Education and \n18 Louisiana school boards.  Another suit was brought by the states of \nTennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, joined \nby an association of Christian teachers and a 15-year-old girl from West \nVirginia.

Respondents further argue that §106.2’s \ndefinition of “hostile environment harassment” is unlawful \nunder Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629 \n(1999), because it waters down the standard for what con-\nstitutes actionable sex-based harassment: Title IX com-\nplainants can prevail under the Rule by showing the alleged \nharassment was severe or pervasive (as opposed to both)\nand do not need to prove that the offending conduct denied \nthem access to educational benefits.  Respondents sepa-\nrately assert that §106.2’s definition of “hostile environ-\nment  harassment”  violates  the  First  Amendment  by \nchilling or compelling speech, including on issues of gender \nidentity.\n  Accordingly, when respondents asked the District Courts \nto preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Rule, they fo-\ncused on the two provisions concerning gender identity—\n§§106.10 and 106.31(a)(2)—and §106.2’s definition of “hos-\ntile environment harassment.”  Respondents alleged that \nthose three provisions would cause them irreparable harm \nif the Rule went into effect.  Specifically, they asserted that \nthey would incur unrecoverable costs in complying with \nthose provisions (and a loss of Title IX funding if they failed \nto do so), that they would lose the right to speak freely on \nissues such as gender identity, and that they would be un-\nable to enforce existing state laws that conflict with the \nRule’s prohibition of gender identity discrimination.  Alt-\nhough respondents’ alleged irreparable harm apparently \ntraces back to just three of the Rule’s provisions, the Dis-\ntrict Courts preliminarily enjoined the Government from \nenforcing the entire Rule in all the respondent States.  \n—————— \n2024 WL 3381901 (ND Tex., July 11, 2024); Arkansas v.

LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \n  After unsuccessful efforts to seek relief from these over-\nbroad injunctions in the lower courts, the Government asks \nthis Court to stay the injunctions in part.  The Government \ndoes not contest the continued injunction as to §106.31(a)(2) \n(regulating access to sex-separated spaces) or §106.2’s defi-\nnition of hostile environment harassment as applied to gen-\nder identity discrimination.  Instead, it asks this Court to  \nstay the injunction as to §106.2’s definition of hostile envi-\nronment harassment as applied to other forms of sex dis-\ncrimination, §106.2’s other definitions, §106.10, and the re-\nmainder of the Rule’s unchallenged provisions.  \nII  \n  I would grant most of the Government’s stay requests and \nleave enjoined only its enforcement of the three challenged \nprovisions.4   A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary” \nexercise of equitable authority, appropriate only “upon a \nclear showing” that a party is “entitled to such relief.”  Win-\nter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7,  \n22 (2008). To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must \nestablish, among other things, that it would likely suffer ir-\nreparable harm without equitable relief.  Ibid.  Even when  \na party makes that showing, though, a court must tailor eq-\nuitable relief to redress the party’s alleged injuries without \nburdening the defendant more than necessary.  See Mad-\nsen,  512  U. S.  at  765  (“[An]  injunction  [should  be]  no \nbroader than necessary to achieve its desired goals”); Ya-\nmasaki, 442 U. S. at 702 (explaining that “relief afforded \n[to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more burdensome than nec-\nessary to redress the complaining parties”).\n  Here, respondents’ alleged injuries flow from the chal-\nlenged provisions. Even assuming respondents established \nthat those provisions subject them to a threat of irreparable \nharm, enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule appears to \n—————— \n4For §106.2, I would leave enjoined only its definition of “hostile envi-\n \nronment harassment.” \n\n  Cite as:  603 U. S. ____ (2024)  7 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \ngo beyond what was necessary to redress those injuries. \n  Consider some of the unchallenged provisions.  The Rule \nrequires schools to provide “reasonable modifications” to \npregnant students, including but not limited to “breaks dur-\ning class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to  \nhealth needs associated with pregnancy or related condi-\ntions.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33887.  A separate provision prohibits \nschools from making a preemployment inquiry as to an ap-\nplicant’s marital status and limits the circumstances under \nwhich a school may make a preemployment inquiry as to an \napplicant’s sex.  Id., at 33896.  The Rule also mandates that \nschools prohibit staff and students from retaliating against \nstudents who file Title IX complaints, and provides the pro-\ncedure a school must follow upon receiving a complaint of \nretaliation. Ibid. Those provisions (like many others in the \nRule) do not reference gender identity discrimination or \nhostile environment harassment and bear no apparent re-\nlationship to respondents’ alleged injuries.  As litigation\nover the Rule proceeds, respondents might be able to show \nthose other portions of the Rule will irreparably harm them \nin a manner justifying further equitable relief. At this junc-\nture, however, enjoining the application of any other part of \nthe Rule needlessly impairs the Government from enforcing \nTitle IX and deprives potential claimants of protections \nagainst forms of sex discrimination not at issue in respond-\nents’ suit. \n  Respondents maintain that the Government must re-\nmain enjoined from enforcing the entire Rule because the \nchallenged provisions “permeate” it.  Respondents fail to ex-\nplain, however, why enjoining enforcement of the entire \nRule at this stage is necessary to redress their alleged inju-\nries.  As an initial matter, many unchallenged provisions \n(such as those governing preemployment inquiries about an \napplicant’s marital status or sex and prohibiting pregnancy \ndiscrimination) include no reference to gender identity dis-\n\n8  DEPARMENT OF EDUCATION v. LOUISIANA \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting in part \ncrimination or hostile environment harassment.  Respond-\nents offer nothing to justify preventing the Government \nfrom enforcing those parts of the Rule.  As for the provisions \nthat do incorporate the Department’s allegedly unlawful \ndefinitions of sex-based discrimination and harassment, re-\nspondents do not explain how those provisions would injure \nthem while the Government is enjoined from enforcing the \ndisputed definitions. Take the Rule’s requirement that em-\nployees be trained on “[t]he scope of conduct that consti-\ntutes sex discrimination under Title IX and this part, in-\ncluding the definition of sex-based harassment.”  89 Fed. \nReg. 33886.  Even respondents do not argue that the train-\ning requirement is itself unlawful.  With the challenged pro-\nvisions out of the picture, the “scope of conduct” under that \ntraining provision would exclude gender identity discrimi-\nnation and hostile environment harassment, the sources of \nrespondents’ alleged injuries.  If  there were any doubt on \nthis score, moreover, the Court could simply have excluded \nthe provision from its stay order.\n  Respondents further assert that the Rule would be un-\nworkable with the Government enjoined from applying its \ndefinition of sex discrimination. For 50 years, however, Ti-\ntle IX regulations have not defined sex discrimination, and \nrespondents offer no evidence that schools cannot comply\nwith their Title IX obligations without such a definition. \n*  *  * \n  By blocking the Government from enforcing scores of reg-\nulations that respondents never challenged and that bear \nno apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries, \nthe lower courts went beyond their authority to remedy the \ndiscrete harms alleged here.

Introduction \nOn June 17, 2024, the Court enjoined enforcement of the Department of Education’s \n(the “Department”) newly promulgated rule implementing Title IX (the “Final Rule”).   [See \nRecord  No.  100.]  The  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  entered  that  date  outlined  the \nsubstantive and procedural failings of the Final Rule while explaining how the plaintiffs had \ncarried their burden of demonstrating the immediate and irreparable harm they would suffer in \nthe absence of an injunction.   \nThe Department filed a Notice of Appeal one week later and has moved this Court for \na partial stay of the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of the Department’s appeal to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  [Record No. 104] The Department \nargues that the Court’s injunction is overly broad, improperly enjoining provisions that were \nnot challenged by the plaintiffs and for which no finding of harm was made.  [Id. at 1] More \nspecifically, it asserts that the allegations of harm raised in the motion for injunction concerned \nonly two provisions—34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) and the definition of “hostile environment \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 2 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2381\nharassment” within 34 C.F.R. § 106.2—and that the Court’s injunction needlessly prevents the \nimplementation of critical regulations that do not cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.  [Id.]  \nThe Department, therefore, contends that the injunction should be limited to those specific \nprovisions. \nThe preliminary injunction was issued after a comprehensive review of the Final Rule, \nwhich fundamentally alters the meaning of “discrimination on the basis of sex” under Title IX \nby improperly relying on the Supreme Court’s holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. \n644  (2020).1   The  undersigned  found  that  the  Final  Rule’s  provisions  and  embedded \ninterpretations would most likely to cause significant and irreparable harm to the plaintiffs by \ncompelling immediate and potentially conflicting changes in policy and practice, leading to \nwidespread confusion and an enormous waste of resources.  The Court further concluded that \nthe Final Rule’s severability clauses offered no remedy because the defects “permeate[]” the \notherwise innocuous regulations—a position the Department refutes.  [See Record No. 100, p. \n90; see also Record No. 113, p. 2.]   \nAfter thorough consideration of the Department’s motion, responsive filings, and the \nrelevant legal standards, the motion for a partial stay of the injunction pending appeal will be \ndenied.  The injunction, as issued, is necessary to prevent immediate harm to the plaintiffs \nwhile the legality of the Final Rule is fully adjudicated.  The Department has not demonstrated \n \n1   Throughout this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the phrase “discrimination on the basis \nof sex” may be referred to more broadly as “sex discrimination” or “sex-based discrimination.”  \nThe use of these abbreviated phrases is not intended to suggest that the terms are inherently \nsynonymous.  Any relevant terms of art will appear in quotation marks with an appropriate citation, \nwhere applicable.   \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 3 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2382\na sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that the balance \nof harms and consideration of the public interest weigh in favor of granting the stay.   \nII.  Legal Standard \n“A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (quoting Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, \n672 (1926)).  The decision to grant such a request is “an exercise of judicial discretion,” \nVirginian Ry. Co., 272 U.S. at 672, and “[t]he party requesting the stay bears the burden of \nshowing that the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion,” Nken, 556 U.S. at 433–\n34.  Courts are accorded “wide latitude” in their discretion to grant or deny stays “to avoid \npiecemeal, duplicative litigation and potentially conflicting results.”  IBEW, Loc. Union No. \n2020 v. AT&T Network Sys., 879 F.2d 864, 1989 WL 78212, at *8 (6th Cir. July 17, 1989) \n(table) (citing Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817–20 \n(1976)). \nWhen evaluating a motion for a stay pending appeal, the Court evaluates four factors: \n“(1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits; (2) the likelihood \nthat the moving party will be irreparably harmed; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed \nby the stay; and (4) the public interest in the stay.”  Dalh v. Bd. of Trs. of W. Mich. Univ., 15 \nF.4th 728, 730 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Crookston v. Johnson, 841 F.3d 396, 398 (6th Cir. \n2016)).  The third and fourth factors—the likely harm to others and the public interest—“merge \nwhen the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.   \nThese factors are not prerequisites.  Instead, they are “interrelated considerations that \nmust be balanced together.”  Mich. Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, \n945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir. 1991).  While no one factor is dispositive, the Sixth Circuit has \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 4 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2383\nrecognized that “the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.”  \nThompson v. DeWine, 959 F.3d 804, 807, 812 (6th Cir. 2020) (per curiam); see Coal. to Def. \nAffirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 244 (6th Cir. 2006).  This is particularly so \nwhere First Amendment concerns are implicated.  See Bays v. City of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, \n819 (6th Cir. 2012). \nIII.  Analysis \nThe standard for granting a stay pending appeal mirrors the considerations for issuing \na preliminary injunction but is viewed through a lens that seeks to maintain the status quo.  See \nUnited States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 n.2 (U.S. 2024).  The Court remains mindful of this \nprinciple while observing that it is the Court’s injunction that maintains the status quo by \npreserving a half-century’s worth of interpretive consensus regarding the mandate of Title IX.  \nBut  even  without  that  consideration,  a  review  of  the  relevant  factors  reinforces  the \nundersigned’s belief that enjoining the Final Rule in full is necessary to maintain regulatory \nstability and prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of this litigation. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on Appeal \nThe Department must put make a “strong showing” of its likelihood of success on the \nmerits of its appeal to justify the requested stay.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; see Griepentrog, 945 \nF.2d at 153 (requiring a stay applicant to “demonstrate more than the mere ‘possibility’ of \nsuccess”).  The Court addresses this factor by examining several key issues raised in the instant \nmotion: the Department’s case for maintaining 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, enjoining 34 C.F.R. \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 5 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2384\n§ 106.2  in  its  entirety,  enjoining  “unchallenged”  provisions  of  the  Final  Rule,  and  the \neffectiveness of the Final Rule’s severability clauses.2 \n1.  Section 106.10 \n  The  Department  challenges  the  injunction  regarding  § 106.10,  arguing  that  this \nprovision,  which  redefines  “discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex”  to  include  sex-adjacent \ncharacteristics, does not harm the plaintiffs and should not be enjoined.  [Record No. 104, pp. \n5–6]  It characterizes this provision as a straightforward application of the Supreme Court’s \nreasoning in Bostock, further arguing that it “is not the cause of Plaintiffs’ claimed harms.”  \n[Id.  at  5]  But  the  Department’s  contention  ignores  entirely  the  plaintiffs’  underlying \narguments, this Court’s findings, and prior observations of the Supreme Court and Sixth \nCircuit. \na.  Bostock’s Inapplicability \n  The Department accepts that “sex is binary and assigned at birth.”  [See Motion Hearing \nTranscript, p. 129.] And it acknowledges that Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of \nsex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  But it fails to recognize is that Bostock’s holding is entirely \nirreconcilable with the text and purpose of Title IX.  By relying so heavily on this Bostock \nreasoning, the Final Rule was constructed on a foundation of quicksand. \nIn Bostock, the Supreme Court began its analysis by noting that Title VII prevents \ndiscrimination “because of” an individual’s sex.  590 U.S. at 656.  The Court found that “the \nordinary meaning of ‘because of’ is ‘by reason of’ or ‘on account of.’”  Id. (quoting Univ. of \nTex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 346, 360 (2013)).  These three phrasal prepositions \n \n2   While there is considerable overlap in some of these topics, the Court will address them \nseparately to facilitate review on appeal.   \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 6 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2385\nexpress a straightforward relationship of cause-and-effect.  Expressed in legal terms, “Title \nVII’s ‘because of’ test incorporates the ‘simple’ and ‘traditional’ standard of but-for causation.”  \nId. (quoting Nassar, 570 U.S. at 346, 360).   \nThe majority opinion offers a useful illustration to help understand Title VII’s but-for \ntest in action.  \nConsider an employer with a policy of firing any woman he discovers to be a \nYankees fan.  Carrying out that rule because an employee is a woman and a fan \nof the Yankees is a firing “because of sex” if the employer would have tolerated \nthe same allegiance in a male employee.  Likewise here.  When an employer \nfires an employee because she is homosexual or transgender, two causal factors \nmay be in play—both the individual’s sex and something else (the sex to which \nthe individual is attracted or with which the individual identifies). \n \nId. at 661.  But, as outlined below, discrimination “because of such individual’s sex” is not, \nand cannot, be the same as discrimination “on the basis of sex.”3 \n  Just as the Supreme Court did in Bostock, this Court begins by ascertaining the plain \nmeaning of the words at issue: “on the basis of”.  See Garland v. Cargill, 602 U.S. 406, 415–\n16 (2024).  The root word “basis” is of Latin origin, meaning “foundation” or “support.”  Basis, \nOxford Dictionary of English Etymology 77 (C. T. Onions, ed., 1966); see also Basis, Black’s \nLaw  Dictionary  185  (11th  ed.  2019)  (“A  fundamental  principle;  an  underlying  fact  or \ncondition; a foundation or starting point.”); Basis, Mirriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law 45 \n(Linda Picard Wood ed. 2016) (“1: something on which something else is established[;] . . . 2: \n \n3   In  the  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  enjoining  the  Final  Rule,  the  undersigned \nconcluded that “on the basis of sex” was not ambiguous and that the Department was not entitled \nto Chevron deference.  [Record No. 100, p. 16 n.6]  While the undersigned’s position has not \nchanged, the Supreme Court’s recent overruling of the Chevron doctrine further reinforces this \nCourt’s constitutional and statutory obligation to reject an agency interpretation at odds with the \nCourt’s independent judgment.  See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, No. 22-451, 2024 WL \n3208360, at *22 (U.S. 2024). \n \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 7 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2386\na basic principle or method.”); Basis, Mirriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 72 (7th ed. \n1973) (“1: Foundation; 2: the principal component of anything; 3: something on which \nanything is constructed or established; 4: the basic principle.”).  Rather than indicating cause-\nand-effect, “on the basis of” is a preposition that indicates a foundational criterion upon which \ndistinctions are made.  In the context of Title IX, that criterion is sex—male or female. \nThis reading is further reinforced by observing that Title VII’s prohibition is victim-\ncentric, whereas Title IX’s makes a broad categorical distinction.  Title VII bars discrimination \n“because of such individual’s” sex—calling for a but-for analysis focused on the individual \nvictim’s sex.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Title IX imposes no  such \nrequirement, speaking instead in broad categorical terms: “No person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded . . . .”4  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added).  This distinction \nreflects prior observations from the Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit that “Title VII . . . is a \nvastly different statute from Title IX.”  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175 \n(2005); see also L.W. by and through Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 484 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(noting that Bostock’s “text-driven reasoning applies only to Title VII”); Meriwether v. Hartop, \n992  F.3d  492,  510  n.4  (6th  Cir.  2021)  (“Title  VII  differs  from  Title  IX  in  important \nrespects . . . Thus,  it  does  not  follow  that  principles  announced  in  the Title VII  context \nautomatically apply in the Title IX context.”).  Giving meaning to  these distinctions is \n \n4   The Supreme Court has acknowledged that Title IX’s meaning would be altered if it instead \nprohibited discrimination “on the basis of such individual’s sex.”  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of \nEduc., 544 U.S. 167, 179 (2005) (emphasis in original); see also Students for Fair Admissions, \nInc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 308 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(noting in the context of Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment: “That such differently worded \nprovisions should mean the same thing is implausible on its face.”). \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 8 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2387\nnecessary under Title IX’s framework, where imposing Title VII’s but-for test or victim-centric \nfocus would entirely undermine the statute’s purpose. \nThe  Department  acknowledges  that  “[s]ome  courts  have  declined  to  extend  the \nSupreme  Court’s  reasoning  in  Bostock  to  Title  IX  by  concluding  that  prohibitions  on \ndiscrimination ‘because of sex’ and discrimination ‘on the basis’ of sex do not mean the same \nthing.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33806.  But it simply “disagrees” with those determinations, instead \nconcluding that “[b]oth phrases simply refer to discrimination motivated in some way by sex.”  \nId. (emphasis added).  As explained below, such a reading is unworkable.   \n  The Final Rule proclaims that “sex separation in certain circumstances, including in the \ncontext of bathrooms or locker rooms, is not presumptively unlawful sex discrimination.”  Id. \nat 33818.  However, when sex separation “denies a transgender student access to a sex-separate \nfacility or activity consistent with that student’s gender identity,” it violates Title IX’s general \nnondiscrimination mandate.  Id.  This is a necessary result of adopting Bostock’s but-for test.  \nBut such a reading would also require schools to permit a non-transgender student to access \nthe locker room or shower facility of his or her choosing: But for the high school quarterback \nbeing male, he would be able to access the female showers.  Yet the Department would \npresumably reject such a claim, referring to the scenario as a “permissible sex separation or \ndifferentiation.”  Id. at 33816 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 106.33).   \nThe Department uses the Bostock holding as a rationale for its entirely new reading of \nTitle IX—one which creates a series of new protected classes not contemplated by the drafters \nof Title IX.  The Department’s “more than de minimis harm standard” serves as a clever, albeit \ntransparent, attempt to neutralize the resulting absurdities—ensuring the new protections apply \nto some and not to others.  Take for example the Final Rule’s declaration that it causes “more \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 9 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2388\nthan de minimis injury” to prevent a transgender student from using the sex-separate facility \nconsistent with the student’s gender identity.  Id. at 33818.  When commenters pointed out that \nthis “elevates protections for transgender students over other students, especially cisgender \ngirls and women,” id. at 33817, the Department explained that it was “unaware of instances in \nwhich cisgender students excluded from facilities inconsistent with their gender identity have \nexperienced the harms transgender students experience as a result of exclusion from facilities \nconsistent with their gender identity,” id. at 33820.  So to clarify, yes; the Department’s Final \nRule expressly grants preferential treatment to transgender students. \n  Under Title IX’s framework, the adoption of Bostock’s but-for test would be contrary \nto  statute  and  entirely  unworkable.    The  Department’s  apparent  remedy  was  to  create \nregulatory carveouts aimed at limiting Bostock’s reasoning to the select class of individuals \nthe Department set out to protect.  In doing so, it created an impermissible litmus test that \ndiscriminates against those that Title VII’s but-for test would otherwise protect (e.g., the \nquarterback).  But because Title VII and Title IX combat discrimination in textually distinct \nways, the Department’s integration of Bostock is fatally flawed. \nb.  Unauthorized Statutory Expansion \nAnother obvious flaw with § 106.10 is found in its drafting.  Title IX expressly \nauthorizes the promulgation of rules prohibiting discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1681(a), 1682.  The Department relies on Bostock to argue that “on the basis of” is \nexpansive of the term “sex,” to include things “inextricably bound up with sex.”  [Record No. \n73, p. 16] (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660–61).  Therefore, the Department reasons that \n“discriminating  against  someone  based  on  their  gender  identity  necessarily  constitutes \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 10 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2389\ndiscrimination ‘on the basis of’ the sex that they were assigned at birth.”  [Id.]  However, \n§ 106.10 takes it one step further.   \nThe  Final  Rule  declares  that  discrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  includes \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33886 (adding 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.10).  By preceding these new classifications with “on the basis of,” a plain reading of \n§ 106.10 coupled with the Department’s Bostock interpretation would necessarily lead to the \nconclusion that Title IX also prohibits all things “inextricably bound up” with “sex stereotypes, \nsex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  \nThe Department admits as much when it acknowledges that one’s gender identity “may or may \nnot be different from their sex assigned at birth.”  Id. at 33809.  It also announces that it \n“interprets ‘sex characteristics’ to include ‘intersex traits,’” and that “gender norms” and \n“gender expression” are “rooted in one or more of the bases already represented in § 106.10.”  \nId. at 33803. \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) requires courts to “decide all relevant \nquestions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning \nor applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  The Department’s \ninterpretation of Title IX transforms the familiar prohibition of sex-based discrimination into \na sweeping anti-discrimination mandate, capable of regulating conduct that neither implicates \nthe male/female dichotomy nor relates to sex at all.  [See Record No. 100, p. 27.]  After utilizing \n“all relevant interpretive tools,” the undersigned concluded that the Department exceeded its \nlegislative authority by expanding the plain meaning of discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  \nSee Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, No. 22-451, 2024 WL 3208360, at *16 (U.S. 2024).  \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 11 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2390\nThis extraordinary departure from Title IX’s purpose—equality of educational opportunity for \ngirls and women—becomes even more evident when considering the following hypotheticals. \nSection 106.10  of  the  Final  Rule  proscribes  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex \nstereotypes,  which  the  Department  concludes  reaches  “discrimination  based  on  others’ \nexpectations regarding a person’s pregnancy or related conditions and assumptions about \nlimitations that may result.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33756.  Section 106.2’s definition of “Pregnancy \nor related conditions” includes “medical conditions related to . . . lactation.”  Id. at 33883.  \nAccordingly, the Department reads Title IX  to prohibit discrimination based on others’ \nexpectations regarding a person’s medical conditions related to lactation and assumptions \nabout any limitations that may result.  Would this provision be violated if a recipient failed to \naccommodate a biological male in his pursuit of lactation?  The Final Rule notes that “being \nable to live consistent with one’s gender identity is critical to the health and well-being of \ntransgender  youth.”    See  id.  at  33819  n.90  (citing  World  Professional  Association  for \nTransgender Health (“WPATH”), Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and \nGender Diverse People, Version 8, 23 Int’l J. Transgender Health S1 (2022)).  The very \nauthority cited in the Final Rule reports that “many” transgender biological males “express the \ndesire to chest/breast feed.”  WPATH, supra at S161 (identifying a case in which a biological \nmale was successful in “lactating and chest/breast feeding”).   \nSimilarly, § 106.10 bars discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics, which “is \nintended to refer to physiological sex-based characteristics,” including, but not limited to “a \nperson’s anatomy, hormones, and chromosomes associated with [being] male or female.”  89 \nFed. Reg. 33811.  The Final Rule announces that no “medical diagnosis” is required and that \nthe provision covers discrimination “based on physiological sex characteristics that differ from \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 12 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2391\nor align with expectations generally associated with male and female bodies.”  Id.  Like the \ndefinition before, it is clear to see how this intentionally undefined definition could capture \nsituations never remotely conceived by Title IX’s authors.  If a male with a high-pitched voice \nis denied the ability to sing a traditionally male part in the school choir, has the school’s choir \ndirector impermissibly discriminated against him by assigning him to a traditionally female \npart that falls within his vocal range?  The number of possible scenarios is limitless given the \nDepartment’s refusal “to make definitive statements about examples.”  Id.  \nGiven the way § 106.10 was written and the Department’s insistence on using vague \nterms—often defined by their nested and equally undefined subterms—the provision far \nexceeds the that which is authorized under Title IX.  The plaintiffs argue, and the undersigned \nagrees, that the Department’s redefinition of sex discrimination in § 106.10 drastically and \nimpermissibly alters the obligations of educational institutions under Title IX.  [See Record \nNos. 110, p. 3; 111, p. 4.]  This expansive interpretation introduces considerable uncertainty \nand  complexity,  necessitating  comprehensive  changes  in  school  policies,  training,  and \nenforcement mechanisms.  The claim that this expansion “does not cause Plaintiffs any injury” \nis plainly without merit.  [Record No. 113, p. 1] \nc.  Procedural Defects \nAside  from  the  substantive  issues  already  addressed,  the  injunction  identifies \nsignificant concerns about the procedural validity of § 106.10.  [See Record No. 100, pp. 66–\n77.]  The Department’s redefinition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” appears to have \nbeen implemented without adequate notice and comment, raising substantial questions under \nthe APA.  [See id. at 76.] (“It is an inescapable conclusion based on the foregoing discussion \nthat  the  Department  has  effectively  ignored  the  concerns  of  parents,  teachers,  and \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 13 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2392\nstudents . . . .”).  The Department’s responses to concerns of bias, vagueness, and overbreadth \noften fell woefully short of that demanded by the APA.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assoc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (requiring agencies to “examine the relevant \ndata and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action”); Encino Motorcars, LLC v. \nNavarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016) (“[W]here the agency has failed to provide even that \nminimal level of analysis, its action is arbitrary and capricious and so cannot carry the force of \nlaw.”).  \nGiven these substantial legal and procedural issues, the Department has not shown a \nstrong likelihood of success on the merits regarding the Court’s decision to enjoin § 106.10.  \nThe provision’s sweeping changes and the procedural deficiencies in its adoption support the \ndecision to include it in the preliminary injunction. \n2.  Enjoining Section 106.2 in its Entirety \n  The Department contends that the Court’s injunction improperly enjoins § 106.2 of the \nFinal Rule in its entirety, arguing that the plaintiffs only challenged its definition of “hostile \nenvironment harassment” as applied to gender identity discrimination.  It maintains that \n“hostile environment harassment” applies outside the context of gender identity and that the \ninjunction improperly enjoined more than was necessary to mitigate the plaintiffs’ alleged \nharms.  [See Record No. 104, p. 6.] \n  This argument fails to recognize the extent to which other applications of “hostile \nenvironment harassment,” and in fact other definitions in § 106.2 more broadly, have been \nirreparably tainted by overarching procedural defects and Bostock reasoning.  This Court’s \nMemorandum Opinion and Order explains, in some detail, how the Final Rule’s definition of \n“hostile environment harassment” is likely to “compel[] speech and otherwise engage[] in \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 14 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2393\nviewpoint discrimination.”  [Record No. 100, p. 48]  The opinion also clear explains that the \nprovision’s reliance on amorphous and undefined terms make it “vague and overbroad in a \nway that impermissibly chills protected speech.”  [Id. at 56]  Despite the Department’s \nargument to the contrary, the plaintiffs’ criticisms of the “hostile environment harassment” \nprovision—and this Court’s analysis—were not limited to the context of gender identity.  [See, \ne.g., id. at 43 (discussing misgendering and compelled speech due to sex stereotyping).]  The \ndefinition  itself  suffers  from  both  procedural  defects  under  the  APA  and  constitutional \ndeficiencies  that  are  implicated  regardless  of  the  metric  being  used  to  define  sex-\ndiscrimination.  [See id. at 54.]  The Court maintains that it is necessary to enjoin enforcement \nof the Final Rule’s “hostile environment harassment” provision in its entirety.  \nThe plaintiffs also have adequately demonstrated that other definitions and obligations \nfound  within  § 106.2  are  meaningless  without  first  determining  the  meaning  of  sex \ndiscrimination.  [See Record No. 110, p. 5.]  For example, § 106.2 defines “relevant” to mean \n“related to the allegations of sex discrimination under investigation as part of the grievance \nprocedures under § 106.45, and if applicable § 106.46.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33884.  This necessarily \ndepends on the scope of sex discrimination and the applicability of Bostock.  Similarly, \n§ 106.2’s definition of “supportive measures” may or may not have to account for protections \nagainst discrimination based on gender identity and more.  Depending on the meaning of sex \ndiscrimination, these definitions will influence the obligations of the Title IX coordinators and \nthe procedures they must follow, thereby affecting the entire grievance process outlined in §§ \n106.44 and 106.45.  See id. at 33885.  These changes are directly tied to key definitions and \ncannot  function  independently  without  creating  significant  regulatory  confusion  or  an \nextraconstitutional judicial rewrite. \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 15 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2394\nThe Supreme Court has consistently recognized that when a statutory or regulatory \nprovision is fundamentally flawed, its interconnected provisions cannot be severed without \ncausing substantial disruption.  See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987) \n(noting that invalid provisions may be dropped where the remainder “is left fully operative as \nlaw”).  Here, the challenged importation of Bostock’s reasoning is so central to the Final Rule \nthat severing expressly challenged provisions is not a viable option.  The Department’s \nsuggested remedy would require this Court to scour the Final Rule’s more than four-hundred \npages of text and make sweeping cuts in a manner that would impermissibly depart from the \nCourt’s judicial function and wade into the realm of executive rulemaking.  See infra Section \nIII.A.3.  Absent such an endeavor, the Final Rule would be incoherent.   \nMoreover, the procedural deficiencies identified in the adoption of these definitions, \nlike those addressed above, raise significant questions under the APA.  The lack of adequate \nreasoned response to these substantial changes undermines the validity of the entire provision.  \nSee FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009) (“[A] reasoned \nexplanation  is  needed  for  disregarding  facts  and  circumstances  that  underlay  or  were \nengendered by the prior policy.”); Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., \n545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005) (“Unexplained inconsistency . . . [may be] a reason for holding an \ninterpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.”).   \nIn summary, the definitions within § 106.2 are integrally connected to the redefinition \nof sex discrimination derived from Bostock, appearing in § 106.10, and articulated in the Final \nRule’s stated “Purpose”.  See 89 Fed. Red. 33476 (purporting “to provide greater clarity \nregarding . . . the  scope  of  sex  discrimination,  including  recipients’  obligations  not  to \ndiscriminate based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 16 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2395\nsexual orientation, and gender identity”).  The plaintiffs have convincingly argued that these \ndefinitions cannot be salvaged without causing significant disruption, regulatory confusion, \nand compliance cost.  Thus, the Court’s decision to enjoin § 106.2 in its entirety is justified. \n3.  Enjoining Other Sections of the Final Rule \nThe Department also challenges the injunction as it pertains to many other sections of \nthe Final Rule, particularly those not expressly named by the plaintiffs.  It contends that these \nsections should not be enjoined as they “have nothing to do with gender identity,” and plaintiffs \nhave not demonstrated imminent injury absent the injunction.  [Record No. 104, p. 3] The \nDepartment provides the following examples: \n[P]rovisions regarding the role of Title IX coordinators, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 \n(34 C.F.R. § 106.8(a)); recipients’ notice and record-keeping obligations, id. at \n33,885-86 (34 C.F.R. § 106.8(c), (f)); access to lactation spaces, id. at 33,888 \n(34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(3)(v)); a recipient’s response to sex discrimination, id. \nat 33,888-91 (34 C.F.R. § 106.44); and grievance procedures for claims of sex \ndiscrimination, id. at 33,891-95 (34 C.F.R. §§ 106.45, 106.46). \n \n[Id. at 3–4] \nFirst, the Court must consider the broader context of these provisions and their interplay \nwith the Final Rule’s interpretive guidance and the provisions more directly at issue (i.e., §§ \n106.2, 106.10, and 106.31(a)(2)).  As observed previously, the Department’s adoption of \nBostock alone necessarily embeds a new meaning of sex discrimination into the entire Final \nRule.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 33802 (noting that the Department believes Title IX’s prohibition \non sex discrimination includes things which “necessarily involves consideration of a person’s \nsex”).  This impermissible expansion of Title IX’s mandate is not confined to the creation of \n§ 106.10—it directly flows from the Department’s importation of Bostock’s Title VII-based \nreasoning. \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 17 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2396\nFor example, the Department suggests that provisions regarding the role of Title IX \ncoordinators were improperly enjoined.  [Record No. 104, p. 3]  But this ignores the fact that \nthe scope of these regulations is unascertainable without first resolving the central dispute \narising under Bostock.  Section 106.8(a) currently requires that a Title IX Coordinator be \ndesignated “to coordinate [the recipient’s] efforts to comply with its responsibilities under \n[Part 106].”  The Final Rule appears significantly more exacting, further insisting a Title IX \nCoordinator “ensure the recipient’s consistent compliance with its responsibilities under Title \nIX and [Part 106].”  89 Fed. Reg. 33885.  But that mandate necessarily calls for “consistent \ncompliance” with responsibilities that the Final Rule defines in light of Bostock.  See, e.g., id. \nat 33569 (describing training obligations under § 106.8(d)(1), which require all employees to \nbe trained “on the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including \nsex-based harassment”). \nThe same issue presents itself when reviewing the recordkeeping obligations outlined \nin the Final Rule’s § 106.8(f).  The Department acknowledges that “§ 106.8(f) broadens the \nexisting  scope  of  the  recordkeeping  requirements . . . because  the  final  recordkeeping \nrequirement  applies  to  all  notifications  to  the  Title  IX  Coordinator  about  conduct  that \nreasonably may constitute sex discrimination and all complaints of sex discrimination.”  Id. at \n33873  (estimating  “that  modifications  to  recipients’  recordkeeping  systems  will  cost \napproximately  $13,022,034  in  Year  1”).    But  this  requirement  is  once  again  rendered \nmeaningless without first determining the meaning of sex discrimination—the central focus of \nthe plaintiffs’ legal challenge. \nThe provisions identified by the Department as being captured in the Court’s overbroad \ninjunction impose new duties on recipients, all of which hinge on the Department’s adoption \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 18 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2397\nof an entirely new understanding of sex discrimination.  [See Record No. 104, pp. 3–4.] \nAllowing these provisions to take effect while enjoining the definitions and interpretations \nfrom which they derive their meaning would require educational institutions to guess as to the \nprovisions’ scopes, creating an inconsistent and unmanageable regulatory framework. \nThe Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of regulated parties knowing what \nis required of them.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253 (2012) (“A \nfundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which regulate persons or entities must \ngive fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required.”); see also Connally v. Gen. Constr. \nCo., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (“[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an \nact in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning \nand differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.”).  The \nplaintiffs have convincingly argued that the Final Rule, in its entirety, fails to provide such \nclarity, and the piecemeal enforcement suggested by the Department would only exacerbate \nthis problem. \nMoreover, the potential constitutional issues raised by the plaintiffs similarly extend to \nthese remaining provisions.  The Department’s redefined sex discrimination standard and \nvague guidance implicates the same First Amendment protections on speech and religious \nexpression that exist elsewhere.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 33493 (declaring that “Title IX’s broad \nprohibition on sex discrimination encompasses, at a minimum, discrimination against an \nindividual based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity”).  If the remaining provisions are preserved, the \nviewpoint discrimination inherent in the Final Rule remains likely to impose an impermissible \nconstraint on an individual’s ability to freely express certain religious and/or philosophical \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 19 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2398\nviewpoints.  [See Record No. 100, pp. 41–56.]  Enjoining § 106.2’s definitions of “sex-based \nharassment”  and/or  “hostile  environment  harassment”  still  leaves  the  existing  “sexual \nharassment” standard in full force.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a).  Permitting the Department’s \nredefinition of “on the basis of sex” to act through existing regulations is no remedy at all. \nThe Department has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits regarding \nthe indirectly contested provisions of the Final Rule, which inherently impose the same harms \nas those challenged with more specificity.  This Court’s injunction is not an overreach but a \nnecessary measure to maintain regulatory coherence and prevent piecemeal implementation \nthat could lead to significant administrative challenges and legal uncertainties. \n4.  Severability Clauses \n  Though  sufficiently  addressed  in  the  preceding  discussion,  the  undersigned  will \nnonetheless  directly  address  the  Department’s  severability  argument.    It  argues  that  the \npreliminary injunction is overly broad because the contested provisions of the Final Rule were \nexpressly severable and intended to operate independently of each other.5  [See Record No. \n104, p. 4.  See also supra Section III.A.2–3.]  But “a severability clause is an aid merely; not \nan inexorable command.”  Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 884–85, n.49 (1997); United States \nv. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 585 n.27 (1968) (“[T]he ultimate determination of severability will \nrarely turn on the presence or absence of such a clause.”).  Severability clauses do not function \n \n5   The  Final  Rule  notes  that  “the  severability  clauses  in  part  106, . . . continue  to  be \napplicable,”  and  identifies  them  by  Subpart:  § 106.9  (Subpart  A—“Introduction”),  § 106.16 \n(Subpart  B—“Coverage”),  § 106.24  (Subpart  C—“Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in \nAdmission and Recruitment Prohibited”), § 106.46 (Subpart D—“Discrimination on the Basis of \nSex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited”), § 106.62 (Subpart E—“Discrimination on \nthe Basis of Sex in Employment in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited”), § 106.72 \n(Subpart F—“Retaliation”), and § 106.82 (Subpart G—“Procedures”).  See 89 Fed. Reg. 33848. \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 20 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2399\nas a get out of jail free card—redeemable by an Executive agency seeking to recruit the Court \ninto the rulemaking process.  See Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582, 625 \n(2016) (quoting Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New Eng., 546 U.S. 320, 329 (2006)) (“A \nseverability clause is not grounds for a court to ‘devise a judicial remedy that . . . entail[s] \nquintessentially legislative work.’”). \nCourts are not required “to proceed in piecemeal fashion,” going “application by \nconceivable application” to effectively rewrite regulations in an effort to save them from their \nstatutory and unconstitutional defects.  Id. at 625–26.  And even when severing a discrete \nprovision is possible, “making distinctions in a murky constitutional context, or where line-\ndrawing is inherently complex,” may require an improper judicial excursion into the legislative \ndomain.  Ayotte, 546 U.S. at 330. \n  The doctrine of severability imposes a two-step inquiry on courts.  First, a court must \ndetermine “whether the [regulation] will function in a manner consistent with the intent of [the \nagency].”  Alaska Airlines, 480 U.S. at 685.  But see Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, \n567 U.S. 519, 692 (2012) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“Even if the remaining provisions will \noperate in some coherent way, that alone does not save the statute.”).  Second, the reviewing \ncourt must determine whether the agency would have promulgated the rule in the absence of \nthe severed provisions.  Alaska Airlines, 480 U.S. at 685.   \nHere, the challenged provisions and embedded interpretive guidance is so integral to \nthe  Final  Rule  that  attempting  to  salvage  provisions  through severance  would  leave  an \nincoherent regulatory framework.  The Department’s melding of Title VII jurisprudence with \nthe Title IX framework is not something that can be severed as a discrete, isolated provision.  \nInstead, it fundamentally redefines the scope and application of Title IX across multiple \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 21 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2400\ncontexts.  The inescapable interconnectedness of the Department’s slew of new interpretations \nsupports the undersigned’s initial determination that a broad injunction is necessary to prevent \nirreparable harm and ensure regulatory coherence. \nBecause the Final Rule would fail to function in the absence of necessarily severed \nprovisions, the Court need not determine whether the Department would have promulgated the \nFinal Rule absent its glaring defects.6  The Department’s argument that the Final Rule’s \nprovisions can be meaningfully severed does not hold up under scrutiny, and thus, the \nDepartment has not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on this point. \nB.  Likelihood of Irreparable Harm \nThe Department also contends that it will suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary \ninjunction  is  not  partially  stayed  pending  appeal.    But  to  justify  this  assertion,  it  must \ndemonstrate  that  the  harm  is  “both  certain  and  immediate,  rather  than  speculative  or \ntheoretical.”  Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at 154.   \nThe Department argues that “[e]very time the federal government ‘is enjoined by a \ncourt from effecting statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of \nirreparable injury.’”  [Record No. 104, p. 6] (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 \n(2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers)).  This is a most curious citation for the Department to lean \non.  The full quotation recognizes the irreparable injury that occurs “any time a State” is \nprevented from effectuating statutes enacted through the legislative process.  See New Motor \nVehicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).  And \nin this case, the Plaintiff States far more convincingly make that very claim.  [See Record No. \n \n6   The Department makes quite clear its view that the severability provisions refute any \nsuggestion to the contrary.  [Record No. 113, p. 3] \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 22 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2401\n1, p. 68.]  They argue persuasively that the Final Rule undermines legislatively enacted State \nstatutes with federal regulations imposed by unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  [See \nid. ¶ 22.] \nThe  Department  also  suggests  that  the  injunction  prevents  the  Final  Rule  from \neffectuating “Title IX’s twin goals of ‘avoiding the use of federal  resources to support \ndiscriminatory practices and providing individual citizens effective protection against those \npractices.’”  [Record No. 104, p. 7] (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979)) \n(cleaned up).  It goes on to suggest the injunction “could prematurely impair the rights of \nindividuals”  by  preventing  the  Department  from  taking  steps  to  ensure  that,  inter  alia, \n“students are not being punished for being pregnant, gay, or transgender.”  [Id.]  However, it \noffers no evidence or support that such acts are occurring and even acknowledges that the \nplaintiffs “nowhere suggest that they intend to engage in discrimination against students for \nbeing pregnant or gay at all.”  [Id. at 5] In short, to the extent such delayed enforcement would \nconstitute a harm to the Department, it is premised on the entirely theoretical notion that \nstudents within the Plaintiff States are being punished for being pregnant, gay, or transgender. \nThe Department also suggests a stay would restore provisions that prohibit things like \n“forcing a student to sit in the back of a classroom because he is gay, excluding a student from \nthe lunchroom because he is transgender, sexually harassing a cisgender woman in a manner \nthat  meets  the  regulatory  definition  of  hostile  environment  harassment,  or  requiring  a \nbreastfeeding student to express breastmilk in a bathroom stall.”  [Record No. 113, p. 6]  But \nonce again, the Department provides no evidence of such things occurring within the Plaintiff \nStates’ jurisdictions. \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 23 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2402\nThe  Department’s  arguments  are  unpersuasive  for  two  clear  reasons.    First,  the \npreliminary  injunction  does  not  eliminate  protections  against  discrimination;  it  merely \nmaintains the status quo pending a thorough judicial review of the Final Rule’s legality.  As \nthe Supreme Court noted in Nken: “A stay is an ‘intrusion into the ordinary processes of \nadministration and judicial review,’ and accordingly ‘is not a matter of right, even if irreparable \ninjury might otherwise result.’”  556 U.S. at 427 (first quoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. \nFed. Power Comm’m, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958) (per curiam); and then quoting \nVirginian Ry. Co., 272 U.S. at 672).   \nSecond, the Department has not demonstrated that the delay in implementing the Final \nRule will cause immediate and irreparable harm.  The protections under the existing regulatory \nframework remain in place, continuing to provide a mechanism for addressing discrimination.  \nThe speculative nature of the Department’s claimed harm is insufficient to meet the rigorous \nstandard required for a stay.  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) \n(standing for the proposition that a stay pending appeal must be supported by more than “a \npossibility of irreparable harm”). \nThe Department has not met its burden of demonstrating that, absent a stay, it will suffer \nirreparable harm.  The speculative nature of the claimed harms and the continued protection \nunder existing regulations all weigh against the issuance of a stay. \nC.  Harm to Others and the Public \n  The third and fourth factors in determining whether to grant a stay pending appeal look \nto the potential harm that will be imposed upon others and the public if the stay is granted.  In \nthis case, the Court considers the harm that the plaintiffs, other interested parties, and the public \nwill likely suffer if the preliminary injunction is stayed, thereby allowing portions of the Final \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 24 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2403\nRule to take effect in less than one month’s time.  These considerations are weighed against \nany potential harm faced by the Department.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20 (noting that the \nbalance of equities must weigh in favor of the party suffering the greater harm).   \nThe plaintiffs argue that, should a stay be granted, the immediate burdens placed on \neducational institutions and their staff will be considerable.  First, the implementation of the \nFinal Rule without a clear resolution of its legality will create substantial administrative and \noperational challenges for schools.  [See Record No. 110, p. 7.]  Requiring schools to comply \nwith some provisions, including those which derive meaning from enjoined provisions, will \nrequire schools to embark on the highly speculative and costly endeavor of overhauling \nexisting policies and training programs while attempting to predict the Final Rule’s ultimate \nform.  [See id. at 8.]  The harm to schools, measured in terms of time and money, has been well \nestablished by the plaintiffs and is neither trivial nor speculative.  [See Record No. 100, Part \nV.] \nSecond, the risk of legal conflict is considerable.  A partial stay would force States to \nnavigate a complex and potentially contradictory regulatory landscape, attempting to reconcile \nexisting state laws and policies with the Final Rule’s mandates.  [See Record No. 19-1, p. 31.]  \nThis uncertainty would likely result in inconsistent enforcement and could expose schools to \nadditional litigation risks, arising under both Title IX and state law.  [See Record No. 100, p. \n63.]  Such a scenario undermines the very purpose of regulatory clarity and stability that Title \nIX aims to achieve. \nThird, the potential harm extends to students and staff who would be directly affected \nby the immediate changes in policies and practices.  This includes infringement on religious \nfreedoms and free speech rights, either through compelled or chilled speech.  See Sorrell v. \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 25 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2404\nIMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 566 (2011) (“The First Amendment requires heightened \nscrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with \nthe message it conveys.”) (citation omitted); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 487 (1960) (“The \nvigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of \nAmerican schools.”).  The plaintiffs have presented credible arguments that the Final Rule’s \nenforcement will likely lead to violations of these constitutional rights.  [See Record No. 100, \npp. 41–56.]   \nFourth, beyond students and staff, the public has a significant interest in the evenhanded \napplication of laws and regulations.  This requires they be drafted in such a way as to “give the \nperson of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.”  Grayned \nv. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).  When a vague regulation “abuts upon sensitive \nareas of basic First Amendment freedoms,” uncertainty will inevitably “inhibit the exercise of \nthose freedoms.”  Id. at 109 (citations omitted).  The Final Rule raises those very concerns.7  \nAllowing the Final Rule to take effect while its legal validity is still in question will disrupt \nexisting clarity and likely leading to inconsistent application and enforcement across different \nstates and educational institutions.  [See Record No. 100, Part VI.] \nThe immediate harm to the plaintiffs will likely be substantial if a stay is granted.  The \nadministrative burdens, legal uncertainties, and potential constitutional violations underscore \nthe need for maintaining the injunction until a final decision is issued.  The injunction \nmaintains the status quo and prevents the immediate and significant harm that would result \n \n7   In the Final Rule, the term “vague” appears thirty-two times; “vagueness,” fourteen times; \n“overbroad,” twenty-one times; and “First Amendment,” two hundred sixty-nine times.  See \ngenerally 89 Fed. Reg. 33474.   \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS   Doc #: 117   Filed: 07/10/24   Page: 26 of 26 - Page ID#:\n2405\nfrom  the  Final  Rule’s  premature  enforcement.    The  balance  of  equities  clearly  favors \nmaintaining the preliminary injunction to prevent these significant harms while this matter is \npending a final determination. \nIV.  Conclusion \nThe Department fails to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.  \nLikewise, it fails to rebut the myriad substantive and procedural flaws with the Final Rule as \ndiscussed at length by the plaintiffs.  Next, the Department’s purported claim of irreparable \nharm is speculative at best, especially in light of the existing protections which remain in place.  \nConversely, the plaintiffs have made a strong showing that granting a stay would result in \nsubstantial and immediate harm to the States, their educational institutions, and all those who \nrely on the services they provide.  Finally, the public interest in upholding regulatory clarity, \nprotecting constitutional rights, and avoiding unnecessary upheaval in schools favors the \nplaintiffs.   \nBased on the foregoing analysis and discussion, it is hereby \n  ORDERED that the Motion for a Partial Stay Pending Appeal filed by the United \nStates Department of Education and Miguel Cardona, Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nEducation [Record No. 104] is DENIED. \nDated: July 10, 2024. \n \n \n- 26 - \n ",

Cardona, et al., No. 24-5588 (argued October 30, 2024) \nDear Ms. Stephens, \nThe State of Tennessee writes to inform the assigned panel of a memorandum opinion and \norder and final judgment issued in this matter today by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Kentucky.  See Mem. Op. & Order & Judgment, Exhibit 1.   \nIn the present appeal, Defendants-Appellants seek review of the district court’s grant of pre-\nliminary injunctive relief against a U.S. Department of Education rule entitled Nondiscrimination on the \nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 \n(Apr. 29, 2024) (“the Final Rule”).  The panel heard oral argument on the preliminary-injunction ap-\npeal on October 30, 2024, see Dkt. 116, and that appeal remains pending.   \nToday, the district court issued an opinion and order that resolves this case in the district court.  \nThe district court’s opinion and order grants summary judgment to the Plaintiff States and Intervenors \nand denies Defendants-Appellants’ cross-motion for summary judgment.  See Ex. 1.  The opinion \nconcludes that “the Final Rule and its corresponding regulations exceed the Department’s authority \nunder Title IX, violate the Constitution, and are the result of arbitrary and capricious agency action.”  \nEx. 1, at 1. \nRegarding remedy, the district court’s opinion notes that “‘[w]hen a reviewing court declares \nthat the challenged action of an administrative agency violates the law, vacatur’”—which “operates on \nthe rule itself”—“‘is the normal remedy’” under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Ex. 1, at 12 (quot-\ning Kiakombua v. Wolf, 498 F. Supp. 3d 1, 50 (D.D.C. 2020)); see also Corner Post v.

Because the \nFinal Rule’s legal errors “fatally taint the entire rule” and are ones the Department “could not” rectify \non remand, Ex. 1, at 12-13, the district court’s opinion concludes that vacatur of the entire Final Rule \nis warranted.  The final judgment specifies that the Final Rule and “its corresponding regulations \nincluding, but not limited to 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.10, 106.31(a)(2), and 106.2 are VACATED.”  Ex. 1, at \n17.

Now, the Court considers \nthe plaintiffs’ and the Department’s competing motions for summary judgment.   \n  Because the Final Rule and its corresponding regulations exceed the Department’s \nauthority under Title IX, violate the Constitution, and are the result of arbitrary and capricious \nagency  action,  the  plaintiffs’  motions  for  summary  judgment  will  be  granted  and  the \nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment will be denied. \nI. \n  The Court recited the factual background of this matter at length in its June 17, 2024, \nand July 10, 2024, Memorandum Opinions; therefore, only the basic facts will be repeated \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 2:  5of 15 - Page\nID#: 5527\nhere.  [See Record Nos. 100, 117.]  On April 29, 2024, the United States Department of \nEducation (the “Department”) issued a Final Rule entitled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of \nSex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance” (the “Final \nRule”).  89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  The Final Rule would bring significant changes \nto the regulations that implement Title IX, three of which are specifically challenged in this \naction.  To begin, for the first time in 50 years, the Final Rule “clarified” that for purposes of \nTitle IX, “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sex \nstereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender \nidentity.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.10; see 89 Fed. Reg. 33476.  The Department indicates that this list \nis  not  exhaustive  and  that  Title  IX  covers  “any  discrimination  that  depends  in  part  on \nconsideration of a person’s sex.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33803. \n  The next provision being challenged by the plaintiffs is commonly referred to as the \n“de minimis harm” standard, which provides as follows: \nIn the limited circumstances in which Title IX . . . permits different treatment or \nseparation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry out such different \ntreatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by \nsubjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, except as permitted by 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 \nthrough  106.15,  20  U.S.C.  §  1686  and  its  corresponding  regulation  § \n106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b). Adopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents  a  person  from  participating  in  an  education  program  or  activity \nconsistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de \nminimis harm on the basis of sex.  \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2); 89 Fed. Reg. 33814-26.  While the regulations do not include a \nspecific definition of “gender identity,” the Department understands the term to “describe an \nindividual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned \nat birth.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33809. \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 3:  6of 15 - Page\nID#: 5528\n  Finally, prior to August 1, 2024, “sexual harassment” under Title IX was defined in \nrelevant part as “conduct on the basis of sex” that is “[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a \nreasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies \na person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.”  34 C.F.R. 106.30 \n(effective Aug. 14, 2020).  The Final Rule redefines this term as “sex-based harassment,” \nwhich means “sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the \nbases described in [34 C.F.R.] § 106.10 . . . .”  34 C.F.R. 106.2.  It includes “[u]nwelcome sex-\nbased conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively \noffensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate \nin or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 \n(emphasis added); 89 Fed. Reg. 33498.  Under the new standard, harassment is not limited to \nspeech occuring on school campuses and may capture conduct that occurs on social media or \n“other platforms.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33535. \nThe plaintiffs include the States of Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, and \nthe Commonwealths of Kentucky and Virginia.  Christian Educators Association International \n(“Christian Educators”) and A.C., a 15-year-old female student athlete, also were permitted to \nintervene as plaintiffs.  These parties (collectively, the “plaintiffs”) argue that the Final Rule \nand its corresponding regulations are invalid because the Department exceeded its lawful \nauthority  in  implementing  them  and  because  they  are  otherwise  contrary  to  law.    The \nDepartment and Secretary Cardona (collectively, the “Department”) maintain that the Final \nRule and its corresponding regulations constitute a valid exercise of rulemaking authority and \ndo not violate any provision of law. \n   \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 4:  7of 15 - Page\nID#: 5529\nII. \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) directs a reviewing court to hold unlawful \nand set aside an agency action when it finds such action to be “(A) arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of a statutory right . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  When a district court rules \non a motion for summary judgment under the APA, “it must apply the proper standard of \nreview outlined in the APA, and its review must be based on the administrative record.”  \nNorton v. Beasley, 564 F. Supp. 3d 547, 569 (E.D. Ky. 2021), vacated on other grounds, No. \n21-6053, 2022 WL 17348385 (6th Cir. Dec. 1, 2022).  See also FreshWater Accountability \nProject v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 629 F. Supp. 3d 761, 770 (S.D. Ohio 2022) \n(observing that “[s]ummary judgment is the appropriate ‘mechanism’ for adjudicating claims \narising under the [Administrative Procedure Act].’”). \nIII. \nA.  The Department exceeded its statutory authority. \n  Congress gave the Department authority to issue rules, regulations, and orders to \neffectuate Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the \nstatute.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  However, the Department exceeded that authority in issuing \nthe Final Rule and the text of Title IX shows why.  Put simply, there is nothing in the text or \nstatutory design of Title IX to suggest that discrimination “on the basis of sex” means anything \nother than it has since Title IX’s inception—that recipients of federal funds under Title IX may \nnot treat a person worse than another similarly-situated individual on the basis of the person’s \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 5:  8of 15 - Page\nID#: 5530\nsex, i.e., male or female.  See Texas v. Cardona, –F.Supp.3d–, 2024 WL 3658767, at *31 (N.D. \nTex. Aug. 5, 2024). \n  The Department’s support for the Final Rule lies primarily in the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., 590 U.S. 644 (2020), which involved claims of \nemployment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, \net seq.  There, the Supreme Court determined that an employer’s decision to terminate an \nemployee  because  of  her  transgender  status  violated  Title  VII’s  prohibition  on  sex \ndiscrimination.  The Court observed that Title VII prohibits employers from taking certain \nactions “because of” sex and “[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of [the \nemployer’s]  decision,  that  is  enough  to  trigger  the  law.”    Id.  at  656.    Reasoning  that \n“transgender status [is] inextricably bound up with sex,” the Court concluded, “to discriminate \non these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat the individual differently because \nof their sex” and therefore, violates Title VII.  Id. at 656, 660-61. \n  The Department reads Bostock far too broadly by importing its holding into the context \nof Title IX.  The Court in Bostock expressly limited its holding to Title VII and, even in that \nrestricted context “[did] not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of \nthe kind.”  590 U.S. at 681.  And as this Court previously observed, the Sixth Circuit has \nrepeatedly acknowledged the limited nature of Bostock’s holding.  See Tennessee v. Cardona, \n–F.3d–, 2024 WL 3019146, at *11-12 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024) (collecting cases).  More \nrecently, the Sixth Circuit stated: \nAs  many  jurists  have  explained,  Title  VII’s  definition  of  discrimination, \ntogether with the employment specific defenses that come with it, do not neatly \nmap  onto  other  areas  of  discrimination.  Title  VII’s  definition  of  sex \ndiscrimination under Bostock simply does not mean the same thing for other \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 6:  9of 15 - Page\nID#: 5531\nanti-discrimination mandates, whether under the Equal Protection Clause, Title \nVI, or Title IX. \n \nAs to the relationship between Title VII and Title IX, the statutes use materially \ndifferent  language:  discrimination  “because  of”  sex  in  Title  VII  and \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” in Title IX.  In addition, the two statutes \nserve different goals and have distinct defenses.  For these reasons, it does not \nfollow that principles announced in the Title VII context automatically apply in \nthe Title IX context.  No less importantly, Congress enacted Title IX as an \nexercise of its Spending Clause Power, which means that Congress must speak \nwith a clear voice before it imposes new mandates on the states. The same is not \ntrue of Title VII.  All of this explains why we have been skeptical of attempts to \nexport Title VII’s expansive meaning of sex discrimination to other settings. \n \nCardona, 2024 WL 3453880, at *2-3 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \n \n  The plain language of a statute “is the starting point for interpretation, and it should \nalso be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear.”  United States v. Choice, \n201 F.3d 837, 840 (6th Cir. 2000); see also Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 \n(2009) (“Statutory construction must begin with language employed by Congress and the \nassumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative \npurpose.”).  Bostock looked not just to the meaning of “sex” which the parties agree is the \n“status as either male or female as determined by reproductive biology.”  See 590 U.S. at 655 \n(alteration omitted).  See also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33802 (defining “sex” as the “physiological” or \n“biological distinctions between male and female”).   But the decision in Bostock turned on \n“what Title VII says about it.”  Id. at 656.  This Court makes the same inquiry here.  And when \nTitle IX is viewed in its entirety, it is abundantly clear that discrimination on the basis of sex \nmeans discrimination on the basis of being a male or female.  See Keen v Helson, 930 F.3d \n799, 803 (6th Cir. 2019) (observing that “the structure and wording of other parts of a statute \ncan help clarify the meaning of an isolated term”). \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24C-cavs-0e0: 02742-5-D58C8R  - C  DJSoc  u  m Deonct :# 1: 1194 3       F  iFleilde:d 0: 10/10/90/92/02255         P Paaggee: :7 1 o0f 15 - Page\nID#: 5532\nAs this Court and others have explained, expanding the meaning of “on the basis of \nsex” to include “gender identity” turns Title IX on its head.  While Title IX sought to level the \nplaying field between men and women, it is rife with exceptions that allow males and females \nto be separated based on the enduring physical differences between the sexes.  See e.g., 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(3)-(9), 1686.  For example, institutions that receive federal funds may \npermit separation of the sexes for purposes of living facilities, boys and girls conferences, and \nsocial sororities and fraternities.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(6)-(a)(7), 1686.  And these are just \na few examples.  The Department compares these provisions to Title VII’s exceptions that \npermit “discrimination” when “religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational \nqualification.”  [See Record No. 134, p. 21-22 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1)).]  However, \nthis argument is hardly convincing, considering the fundamental difference between Title VII \nand Title IX.  Title VII prohibits discrimination in the workplace generally and, thus, the \nexceptions for bona fide occupational qualifications do not have the potential to swallow the \nentire statute.  Conversely, the entire point of Title IX is to prevent discrimination based on \nsex—throwing gender identity into the mix eviscerates the statute and renders it largely \nmeaningless.   \nThe Final Rule would leave 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)-(9) and 1686 intact while adding \nregulations that mandate access to showers, locker rooms, and sexual education classes, among \nothers, consistent with an individual’s gender identity.  See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31, 106.33.  But \nthis  approach  simply  does  not  make  sense.    Confirming  the  arbitrary  nature  of  these  new \nregulations, the Department has offered no rational explanation for the stark inconsistencies that \nwill result if the Final Rule is allowed to go forward.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 33, 818 (simply stating \nthat the statute “created exceptions” to the general prohibition on discrimination in 20 U.S.C. § \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24C-cavs-0e0: 02742-5-D58C8R  - C  DJSoc  u  m Deonct :# 1: 1194 3       F  iFleilde:d 0: 10/10/90/92/02255         P Paaggee: :8 1 o1f 15 - Page\nID#: 5533\n1681(a)(1)-(9), 20 U.S.C. § 1686, and that “the unique circumstances of athletics merit[s] a \ndifferent approach to addressing sex discrimination”).   \nThe Court exercises its independent judgment in interpreting Title IX and determining \nwhether the Department acted within its statutory authority.  See  Loper Bright Enters. v. \nRaimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412-13 (2024).  And while the Department maintains that the \nchallenged provisions are “not contrary” to Title IX, this Court is tasked with “identify[ing] the \nstatute’s ‘single, best meaning’ rather than a merely permissible one.”  See Tennessee v. Becerra, \n117 F.4th 348, 371 (6th Cir. 2024) (J. Kethledge, dissenting, in part, and concurring, in part) \n(quoting Loper Bright Enters., 604 U.S. at 400).  Accordingly, 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, which \nimpermissibly redefines discrimination on the basis of sex for purposes of Title IX, must be \nset aside. \nB.  The Final Rule violates the Constitution. \nThe Final Rule also suffers significant constitutional infirmities.  The Court remains \npersuaded that the Final Rule offends the First Amendment for the reasons explained in its \nprior Memorandum Opinions and Orders.  [See Record Nos. 100, 117.]  To recap briefly, the \nFinal Rule’s definitions of sex discrimination and sex-based harassment, combined with the \nde minimis harm standard, require Title IX recipients, including teachers, to use names and \npronouns associated with a student’s asserted gender identity.  While the Department insists \nthat this is not necessarily the case (see Record No. 134, p. 39), the new subjective harassment \nstandard that need only “limit” participation in an educational program or activity, quite clearly \ncompels this result.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 33516 (stating that “whether verbal conduct constitutes sex-\nbased harassment is necessarily fact-specific” and acknowledging that “a stray remark, such as a \nmisuse of language,” would not constitute harassment) (emphasis added).   \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24C-cavs-0e0: 02742-5-D58C8R  - C  DJSoc  u  m Deonct :# 1: 1194 3       F  iFleilde:d 0: 10/10/90/92/02255         P Paaggee: :9 1 o2f 15 - Page\nID#: 5534\nAs the Sixth Circuit recognized in Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 508 (6th Cir. 2021), \n“[p]ronouns can and do convey a powerful message implicating a sensitive topic of public \nconcern.”  The plaintiffs reasonably fear that teachers’ (and others’) speech concerning gender \nissues or their failure to use gender-identity-based pronouns would constitute harassment under \nthe Final Rule.  Put simply, the First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech \nor compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner.  See id.  See also \nWooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977). \nThe Final Rule also is vague and overbroad.   In Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Education, \n526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999), the Supreme Court held that a private cause of action under Title IX \nwill lie “only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \neffectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.”  The new regulation \ngoes far beyond this standard and prohibits “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or \npervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the \nrecipient’s education program or activity. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 (emphasis added); 89 Fed. \nReg. 33498.  As the Court explained previously, several of the terms used in this regulation \nare so vague that recipients of Title IX funds have no way of predicting what conduct will \nviolate the law.  See Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 539 (6th Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat “[t]he void-for-vagueness doctrine not only ensures that laws provide fair warning of \nproscribed conduct, but also protects citizens against the impermissible delegation of basic \npolicy matters for resolution on an ad hoc basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory application”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 1: 01 3of 15 - Page\nID#: 5535\nThe Final Rule also violates the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution.  See \nU.S. CONS. ART. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The Spending Clause allows Congress to “attach conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds . . . to further broad policy objectives.”  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, \n206-07 (1987).  See also Davis., 526 U.S. at 640 (observing that Title IX was enacted pursuant to \nCongress’ authority under the Spending Clause).  This spending power functions in the nature of \na contract—“in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \nconditions.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  Legislation that \nconditions the receipt of federal funds (1) must be in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) impose \nunambiguous conditions; (3) the conditions must relate to federal interests in the program; and (4) \nthe conditions must not induce unconstitutional action.  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207-08.   \nThe Final Rule fails the fourth prong for the reasons already discussed.  Further, Title IX \ndoes not unambiguously condition the receipt of funds on the prohibition of gender identity \ndiscrimination.  See Kansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., –F.Supp.3d–, 2024 3273285, at *12-13 (D. \nKan. July, 2, 2024).  When a state accepts a federal grant, it must do so knowingly and voluntarily.  \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17.  This means that Congress must provide “clear notice” of the obligations \na spending law entails.  Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 348 (6th Cir. 2022) (emphasis added) \n(citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25).  Here, the Department expands Title IX to encompass entirely \nnew subject matter that is not contemplated by the text of the statute.  Further, the Department “has \nnot had regulations regarding gender identity discrimination on the books for several years and, \njust a few short years ago, took a position contrary to the one being advanced today.”  Id. at *13.  \nIn the absence of a clear statement from Congress, particularly when the extensive consequences \nof the Final Rule are considered, the Final Rule cannot stand. \n   \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 1: 11 4of 15 - Page\nID#: 5536\nC.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \nThe Court remains persuaded that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  [See Record \nNos. 100, 117.]  The Department does not provide a reasoned explanation for departing from its \nlongstanding interpretation of Title IX.  Although it relies primarily on Bostock, the Supreme Court \nwas clear that the decision was limited to the context of Title VII and did not purport to address \n“bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.  Given the \nCourt’s express disclaimer and the striking differences between Title VII and Title IX, Bostock is \na very shaky place for the Department to hang its hat.   \nFurther, the Department fails to account for the glaring inconsistencies that the Final Rule \ncreates within Title IX.  It acknowledges that Congress has deemed sex separation (and thus, more \nthan de minimis harm) permissible in various circumstances such as social fraternities and \nsororities and living facilities.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(6), 1686.  Yet, the new regulations say \nthat recipients cannot separate the sexes (thus inflicting more than de minimis harm) for purposes \nof other “living facilities” such as bathrooms, toilets, or showers.  See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31, 106.33.  \nIn support, the Department cites “case law, research, testimony  and comments from stakeholders, \nand evidence from schools’ many years of practical experience” indicating “that preventing a \nperson from participating in a program or accessing a sex-separate facility consistent with their \ngender identity subjects them to harm.”  [Record No. 133, p. 25 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. 33818-19).]  \nAssuming this is true, doesn’t it also subject such persons to harm when they are prevented from \nparticipating in the social fraternity or sorority consistent with their gender identity?  Or when they \nare prevented from residing in a living facility consistent with their gender identity?  It seems clear \nthat the answer is “yes,” which indicates that Title IX does not encompass the issue of gender \nidentity at all. \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 1: 21 5of 15 - Page\nID#: 5537\nIV. \n  Having determined that the challenged portions of the Final Rule are invalid, the Court \nconsiders the appropriate remedy.  While the Department argues in favor of severance, the Court \nremains persuaded that the three challenged provisions fatally taint the entire rule.  As the Court \nhas explained, the definition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” lies at the heart of Title IX and \npermeates virtually every provision of the law.   \nWhile not directly challenged in this proceeding, the Final Rule brings new requirements \nfor handling grievances, training, recordkeeping, and processing complaints.  But these regulations \nrefer to and incorporate provisions the Court deems invalid, which necessitates jettisoning these \nregulations  as  well.    See  34  C.F.R.  §§  106.44  (Recipient’s  response  to  sex  discrimination \n(including multiple references to sex-based harassment)); 106.45 (Grievance procedures for the \nprompt  and  equitable  resolution  of  complaints  of  sex  discrimination  (relying  on  §  106.2’s \ndefinition of sex-based harassment)); 106.46 (Grievance procedures for the prompt and equitable \nresolution of complaints of sex-based harassment involving student complainants or student \nrespondents at postsecondary institutions (same)).  While there appears to be at least one provision \nthat is not directly impacted by the plaintiffs’ challenge, see 34 C.F.R. § 106.40 (Aug. 1, 2024) \n(“Parental, family or marital status; pregnancy or related conditions), it simply is not proper for \nthe  Court  to  rewrite  the  regulations  by  excising  the  offending  material,  particularly  when \nrulemaking is the exclusive duty of the Executive Branch.  See Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of \nN. New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006).  Thus, the undersigned concludes that the entire Final Rule \nand corresponding regulations are invalid and must be set aside. \n   “[W]hen a reviewing court declares that the challenged action of an administrative agency \nviolates the law, vacatur is the ‘normal remedy.’”  Kiakombua v.

In essence,  a vacatur order “takes the unlawful \nagency action ‘off the books’”—“an entirely appropriate response when a plaintiff successfully \nestablishes that the agency’s conduct violates the law.”  Kiakomba, 746 F. Supp. 3d at 50 (citations \nomitted).  Vacatur operates on the rule itself and prevents the rule’s “application to all who would \notherwise be subject to its operation.”  See Kentucky, 728 F. Supp. 3d at 522 (quoting East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Garland, 994 F.3d 962, 987 (9th Cir. 2020)). \n  Although the Court has discretion to craft a different remedy, there is no reason to do so \nhere.  “In general, whether vacatur is appropriate depends ‘on the seriousness of the agency error \nand the disruptive consequences of vacatur.’”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 60 F.4th 1008, 1022 (6th Cir. \n2023) (quoting Long Island Power Auth. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, 27 F.4th 705, 717 (D.C. \nCir. 2022)).  The seriousness of the error weighs heavily in favor of vacating the Final Rule, as it \nis unlawful on numerous fronts.  See id. (observing that “the seriousness of the agency’s error \ndepends on how likely it is the agency will be able to justify its decision on remand”) (cleaned up).  \nIn other words, the Department could not adopt the same rule on remand by “offer[ing] better \nreasoning” or “complying with procedural rules.”  See id. (quoting Pollinator Stewardship Council \nv. EPA, 806 F.3d 520, 532 (9th Cir. 2015)). \n  Additionally, vacatur of the Final Rule is not likely to have a disruptive effect.  As far as \nthis Court is aware, every court presented with a challenge to the Final Rule has indicated that it \nis unlawful.  See Alabama v. U.S. Sec. of Educ., No. 24-12444, 2024 WL 3981994 (11th Cir. Aug. \n22, 2024); Oklahoma v. Cardona, No. CIV-24-00461-JD, 2024 WL 3609109 (W.D. Okla. July 31, \n2024); Arkansas v.

Dept. of Educ., No. 3:24-CV-00563, 2024 WL 2978786 (W.D. La. June 13, 2024).  Further, \nvacatur of the Final Rule would simply “cause a return to the status quo” that existed for more than \n50 years prior to its effective date.  See Sierra Club, 60 F.4th at 1023 (concluding that returning to \nthe regulatory regime that had been in place for almost 50 years would not have a disruptive effect). \n  Vacatur of the Final Rule effectively moots the plaintiffs’ request for permanent injunctive \nrelief.  However, Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[t]he existence of \nanother adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.”  \nSee also 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (providing that a court may “declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be \nsought”).  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief stating that: (1) the Final Rule is unlawful because \nTitle IX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination does not include the bases or conduct covered by § \n106.02’s hostile-environment harassment definition, § 106.10, or § 106.31(a)’s regulation of sex-\nsegregated facilities and programs; (2) the Final Rule is unlawful because it violates the Spending \nClause and the First Amendment; (3) the Final Rule is unlawful because it is arbitrary and \ncapricious; and (4) Plaintiff States, their political subdivisions, and their recipient schools are \nentitled to funding irrespective of compliance with the Rule.   \nThe plaintiffs’ requested declaratory relief is substantially consistent with the Court’s \ndecision and will be granted.  However, the Court will modify the fourth request slightly, as it goes \ntoo far to affirmatively conclude that the plaintiff-States “are entitled to funding irrespective of \ntheir compliance with the Rule.”  After all, the plaintiff-States potentially could violate Title IX in \nways  unrelated  to  the  Final  Rule,  which  might  render  them  ineligible  for  federal  funding.  \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-Ccva-s0e0:0 2742--5D5C88R - C   JDSo c  u  mDoecn t#: :1 11493         F Filieledd: :0 011/0/099/2/2052 5       P  aPgaeg:e 1: 51 8of 15 - Page\nID#: 5540\nAccordingly, a more accurate way to characterize this declaratory relief is that the Plaintiff States, \ntheir political subdivisions, and their recipient schools need not comply with the Rule to receive \nfederal funding. \nV. \nBased on the foregoing analysis, and incorporating the Court’s June 17, 2024 and July 10, \n2024 Memorandum Opinions and Orders [Record Nos. 100, 117] by reference, it is hereby \nORDERED as follows: \n1.

On June \n17, 2024, this Court granted the plaintiff-States and Intervenor plaintiffs’ motions for a \npreliminary injunction and stay, which prevented the challenged Final Rule from going into \neffect with respect to the plaintiffs as planned on August 1, 2024.  Now, the Court considers \nthe plaintiffs’ and the Department’s competing motions for summary judgment.   \n  Because the Final Rule and its corresponding regulations exceed the Department’s \nauthority under Title IX, violate the Constitution, and are the result of arbitrary and capricious \nagency  action,  the  plaintiffs’  motions  for  summary  judgment  will  be  granted  and  the \nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment will be denied. \nI. \n  The Court recited the factual background of this matter at length in its June 17, 2024, \nand July 10, 2024, Memorandum Opinions; therefore, only the basic facts will be repeated \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 2 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5527\nhere.  [See Record Nos. 100, 117.]  On April 29, 2024, the United States Department of \nEducation (the “Department”) issued a Final Rule entitled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of \nSex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance” (the “Final \nRule”).  89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  The Final Rule would bring significant changes \nto the regulations that implement Title IX, three of which are specifically challenged in this \naction.  To begin, for the first time in 50 years, the Final Rule “clarified” that for purposes of \nTitle IX, “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sex \nstereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender \nidentity.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.10; see 89 Fed. Reg. 33476.  The Department indicates that this list \nis  not  exhaustive  and  that  Title  IX  covers  “any  discrimination  that  depends  in  part  on \nconsideration of a person’s sex.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33803. \n  The next provision being challenged by the plaintiffs is commonly referred to as the \n“de minimis harm” standard, which provides as follows: \nIn the limited circumstances in which Title IX . . . permits different treatment or \nseparation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry out such different \ntreatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by \nsubjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, except as permitted by 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 \nthrough  106.15,  20  U.S.C.  §  1686  and  its  corresponding  regulation  § \n106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b). Adopting a policy or engaging in a practice that \nprevents  a  person  from  participating  in  an  education  program  or  activity \nconsistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de \nminimis harm on the basis of sex.  \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2); 89 Fed. Reg. 33814-26.  While the regulations do not include a \nspecific definition of “gender identity,” the Department understands the term to “describe an \nindividual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned \nat birth.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33809. \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 3 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5528\n  Finally, prior to August 1, 2024, “sexual harassment” under Title IX was defined in \nrelevant part as “conduct on the basis of sex” that is “[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a \nreasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies \na person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.”  34 C.F.R. 106.30 \n(effective Aug. 14, 2020).  The Final Rule redefines this term as “sex-based harassment,” \nwhich means “sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the \nbases described in [34 C.F.R.] § 106.10 . . . .”  34 C.F.R. 106.2.  It includes “[u]nwelcome sex-\nbased conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively \noffensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate \nin or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 \n(emphasis added); 89 Fed. Reg. 33498.  Under the new standard, harassment is not limited to \nspeech occuring on school campuses and may capture conduct that occurs on social media or \n“other platforms.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33535. \nThe plaintiffs include the States of Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, and \nthe Commonwealths of Kentucky and Virginia.  Christian Educators Association International \n(“Christian Educators”) and A.C., a 15-year-old female student athlete, also were permitted to \nintervene as plaintiffs.  These parties (collectively, the “plaintiffs”) argue that the Final Rule \nand its corresponding regulations are invalid because the Department exceeded its lawful \nauthority  in  implementing  them  and  because  they  are  otherwise  contrary  to  law.    The \nDepartment and Secretary Cardona (collectively, the “Department”) maintain that the Final \nRule and its corresponding regulations constitute a valid exercise of rulemaking authority and \ndo not violate any provision of law. \n   \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 4 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5529\nII. \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) directs a reviewing court to hold unlawful \nand set aside an agency action when it finds such action to be “(A) arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of a statutory right . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  When a district court rules \non a motion for summary judgment under the APA, “it must apply the proper standard of \nreview outlined in the APA, and its review must be based on the administrative record.”  \nNorton v. Beasley, 564 F. Supp. 3d 547, 569 (E.D. Ky. 2021), vacated on other grounds, No. \n21-6053, 2022 WL 17348385 (6th Cir. Dec. 1, 2022).  See also FreshWater Accountability \nProject v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 629 F. Supp. 3d 761, 770 (S.D. Ohio 2022) \n(observing that “[s]ummary judgment is the appropriate ‘mechanism’ for adjudicating claims \narising under the [Administrative Procedure Act].’”). \nIII. \nA.  The Department exceeded its statutory authority. \n  Congress gave the Department authority to issue rules, regulations, and orders to \neffectuate Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination consistent with the objectives of the \nstatute.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  However, the Department exceeded that authority in issuing \nthe Final Rule and the text of Title IX shows why.  Put simply, there is nothing in the text or \nstatutory design of Title IX to suggest that discrimination “on the basis of sex” means anything \nother than it has since Title IX’s inception—that recipients of federal funds under Title IX may \nnot treat a person worse than another similarly-situated individual on the basis of the person’s \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 5 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5530\nsex, i.e., male or female.  See Texas v. Cardona, –F.Supp.3d–, 2024 WL 3658767, at *31 (N.D. \nTex. Aug. 5, 2024). \n  The Department’s support for the Final Rule lies primarily in the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., 590 U.S. 644 (2020), which involved claims of \nemployment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, \net seq.  There, the Supreme Court determined that an employer’s decision to terminate an \nemployee  because  of  her  transgender  status  violated  Title  VII’s  prohibition  on  sex \ndiscrimination.  The Court observed that Title VII prohibits employers from taking certain \nactions “because of” sex and “[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of [the \nemployer’s]  decision,  that  is  enough  to  trigger  the  law.”    Id.  at  656.    Reasoning  that \n“transgender status [is] inextricably bound up with sex,” the Court concluded, “to discriminate \non these grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat the individual differently because \nof their sex” and therefore, violates Title VII.  Id. at 656, 660-61. \n  The Department reads Bostock far too broadly by importing its holding into the context \nof Title IX.  The Court in Bostock expressly limited its holding to Title VII and, even in that \nrestricted context “[did] not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of \nthe kind.”  590 U.S. at 681.  And as this Court previously observed, the Sixth Circuit has \nrepeatedly acknowledged the limited nature of Bostock’s holding.  See Tennessee v. Cardona, \n–F.3d–, 2024 WL 3019146, at *11-12 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024) (collecting cases).  More \nrecently, the Sixth Circuit stated: \nAs  many  jurists  have  explained,  Title  VII’s  definition  of  discrimination, \ntogether with the employment specific defenses that come with it, do not neatly \nmap  onto  other  areas  of  discrimination.  Title  VII’s  definition  of  sex \ndiscrimination under Bostock simply does not mean the same thing for other \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 6 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5531\nanti-discrimination mandates, whether under the Equal Protection Clause, Title \nVI, or Title IX. \n \nAs to the relationship between Title VII and Title IX, the statutes use materially \ndifferent  language:  discrimination  “because  of”  sex  in  Title  VII  and \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” in Title IX.  In addition, the two statutes \nserve different goals and have distinct defenses.  For these reasons, it does not \nfollow that principles announced in the Title VII context automatically apply in \nthe Title IX context.  No less importantly, Congress enacted Title IX as an \nexercise of its Spending Clause Power, which means that Congress must speak \nwith a clear voice before it imposes new mandates on the states. The same is not \ntrue of Title VII.  All of this explains why we have been skeptical of attempts to \nexport Title VII’s expansive meaning of sex discrimination to other settings. \n \nCardona, 2024 WL 3453880, at *2-3 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \n \n  The plain language of a statute “is the starting point for interpretation, and it should \nalso be the ending point if the plain meaning of that language is clear.”  United States v. Choice, \n201 F.3d 837, 840 (6th Cir. 2000); see also Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 \n(2009) (“Statutory construction must begin with language employed by Congress and the \nassumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative \npurpose.”).  Bostock looked not just to the meaning of “sex” which the parties agree is the \n“status as either male or female as determined by reproductive biology.”  See 590 U.S. at 655 \n(alteration omitted).  See also 89 Fed. Reg. at 33802 (defining “sex” as the “physiological” or \n“biological distinctions between male and female”).   But the decision in Bostock turned on \n“what Title VII says about it.”  Id. at 656.  This Court makes the same inquiry here.  And when \nTitle IX is viewed in its entirety, it is abundantly clear that discrimination on the basis of sex \nmeans discrimination on the basis of being a male or female.  See Keen v Helson, 930 F.3d \n799, 803 (6th Cir. 2019) (observing that “the structure and wording of other parts of a statute \ncan help clarify the meaning of an isolated term”). \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 7 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5532\nAs this Court and others have explained, expanding the meaning of “on the basis of \nsex” to include “gender identity” turns Title IX on its head.  While Title IX sought to level the \nplaying field between men and women, it is rife with exceptions that allow males and females \nto be separated based on the enduring physical differences between the sexes.  See e.g., 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(3)-(9), 1686.  For example, institutions that receive federal funds may \npermit separation of the sexes for purposes of living facilities, boys and girls conferences, and \nsocial sororities and fraternities.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(6)-(a)(7), 1686.  And these are just \na few examples.  The Department compares these provisions to Title VII’s exceptions that \npermit “discrimination” when “religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational \nqualification.”  [See Record No. 134, p. 21-22 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1)).]  However, \nthis argument is hardly convincing, considering the fundamental difference between Title VII \nand Title IX.  Title VII prohibits discrimination in the workplace generally and, thus, the \nexceptions for bona fide occupational qualifications do not have the potential to swallow the \nentire statute.  Conversely, the entire point of Title IX is to prevent discrimination based on \nsex—throwing gender identity into the mix eviscerates the statute and renders it largely \nmeaningless.   \nThe Final Rule would leave 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(1)-(9) and 1686 intact while adding \nregulations that mandate access to showers, locker rooms, and sexual education classes, among \nothers, consistent with an individual’s gender identity.  See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31, 106.33.  But \nthis  approach  simply  does  not  make  sense.    Confirming  the  arbitrary  nature  of  these  new \nregulations, the Department has offered no rational explanation for the stark inconsistencies that \nwill result if the Final Rule is allowed to go forward.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 33, 818 (simply stating \nthat the statute “created exceptions” to the general prohibition on discrimination in 20 U.S.C. § \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 8 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5533\n1681(a)(1)-(9), 20 U.S.C. § 1686, and that “the unique circumstances of athletics merit[s] a \ndifferent approach to addressing sex discrimination”).   \nThe Court exercises its independent judgment in interpreting Title IX and determining \nwhether the Department acted within its statutory authority.  See  Loper Bright Enters. v. \nRaimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 412-13 (2024).  And while the Department maintains that the \nchallenged provisions are “not contrary” to Title IX, this Court is tasked with “identify[ing] the \nstatute’s ‘single, best meaning’ rather than a merely permissible one.”  See Tennessee v. Becerra, \n117 F.4th 348, 371 (6th Cir. 2024) (J. Kethledge, dissenting, in part, and concurring, in part) \n(quoting Loper Bright Enters., 604 U.S. at 400).  Accordingly, 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, which \nimpermissibly redefines discrimination on the basis of sex for purposes of Title IX, must be \nset aside. \nB.  The Final Rule violates the Constitution. \nThe Final Rule also suffers significant constitutional infirmities.  The Court remains \npersuaded that the Final Rule offends the First Amendment for the reasons explained in its \nprior Memorandum Opinions and Orders.  [See Record Nos. 100, 117.]  To recap briefly, the \nFinal Rule’s definitions of sex discrimination and sex-based harassment, combined with the \nde minimis harm standard, require Title IX recipients, including teachers, to use names and \npronouns associated with a student’s asserted gender identity.  While the Department insists \nthat this is not necessarily the case (see Record No. 134, p. 39), the new subjective harassment \nstandard that need only “limit” participation in an educational program or activity, quite clearly \ncompels this result.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 33516 (stating that “whether verbal conduct constitutes sex-\nbased harassment is necessarily fact-specific” and acknowledging that “a stray remark, such as a \nmisuse of language,” would not constitute harassment) (emphasis added).   \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 9 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5534\nAs the Sixth Circuit recognized in Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 508 (6th Cir. 2021), \n“[p]ronouns can and do convey a powerful message implicating a sensitive topic of public \nconcern.”  The plaintiffs reasonably fear that teachers’ (and others’) speech concerning gender \nissues or their failure to use gender-identity-based pronouns would constitute harassment under \nthe Final Rule.  Put simply, the First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech \nor compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner.  See id.  See also \nWooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977). \nThe Final Rule also is vague and overbroad.   In Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Education, \n526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999), the Supreme Court held that a private cause of action under Title IX \nwill lie “only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \neffectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.”  The new regulation \ngoes far beyond this standard and prohibits “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or \npervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the \nrecipient’s education program or activity. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 (emphasis added); 89 Fed. \nReg. 33498.  As the Court explained previously, several of the terms used in this regulation \nare so vague that recipients of Title IX funds have no way of predicting what conduct will \nviolate the law.  See Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 539 (6th Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat “[t]he void-for-vagueness doctrine not only ensures that laws provide fair warning of \nproscribed conduct, but also protects citizens against the impermissible delegation of basic \npolicy matters for resolution on an ad hoc basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory application”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).   \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 10 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5535\nThe Final Rule also violates the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution.  See \nU.S. CONS. ART. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The Spending Clause allows Congress to “attach conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds . . . to further broad policy objectives.”  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, \n206-07 (1987).  See also Davis., 526 U.S. at 640 (observing that Title IX was enacted pursuant to \nCongress’ authority under the Spending Clause).  This spending power functions in the nature of \na contract—“in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \nconditions.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  Legislation that \nconditions the receipt of federal funds (1) must be in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) impose \nunambiguous conditions; (3) the conditions must relate to federal interests in the program; and (4) \nthe conditions must not induce unconstitutional action.  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207-08.   \nThe Final Rule fails the fourth prong for the reasons already discussed.  Further, Title IX \ndoes not unambiguously condition the receipt of funds on the prohibition of gender identity \ndiscrimination.  See Kansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., –F.Supp.3d–, 2024 3273285, at *12-13 (D. \nKan. July, 2, 2024).  When a state accepts a federal grant, it must do so knowingly and voluntarily.  \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17.  This means that Congress must provide “clear notice” of the obligations \na spending law entails.  Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 348 (6th Cir. 2022) (emphasis added) \n(citing Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25).  Here, the Department expands Title IX to encompass entirely \nnew subject matter that is not contemplated by the text of the statute.  Further, the Department “has \nnot had regulations regarding gender identity discrimination on the books for several years and, \njust a few short years ago, took a position contrary to the one being advanced today.”  Id. at *13.  \nIn the absence of a clear statement from Congress, particularly when the extensive consequences \nof the Final Rule are considered, the Final Rule cannot stand. \n   \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 11 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5536\nC.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \nThe Court remains persuaded that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  [See Record \nNos. 100, 117.]  The Department does not provide a reasoned explanation for departing from its \nlongstanding interpretation of Title IX.  Although it relies primarily on Bostock, the Supreme Court \nwas clear that the decision was limited to the context of Title VII and did not purport to address \n“bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  See Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.  Given the \nCourt’s express disclaimer and the striking differences between Title VII and Title IX, Bostock is \na very shaky place for the Department to hang its hat.   \nFurther, the Department fails to account for the glaring inconsistencies that the Final Rule \ncreates within Title IX.  It acknowledges that Congress has deemed sex separation (and thus, more \nthan de minimis harm) permissible in various circumstances such as social fraternities and \nsororities and living facilities.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681(a)(6), 1686.  Yet, the new regulations say \nthat recipients cannot separate the sexes (thus inflicting more than de minimis harm) for purposes \nof other “living facilities” such as bathrooms, toilets, or showers.  See 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.31, 106.33.  \nIn support, the Department cites “case law, research, testimony  and comments from stakeholders, \nand evidence from schools’ many years of practical experience” indicating “that preventing a \nperson from participating in a program or accessing a sex-separate facility consistent with their \ngender identity subjects them to harm.”  [Record No. 133, p. 25 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. 33818-19).]  \nAssuming this is true, doesn’t it also subject such persons to harm when they are prevented from \nparticipating in the social fraternity or sorority consistent with their gender identity?  Or when they \nare prevented from residing in a living facility consistent with their gender identity?  It seems clear \nthat the answer is “yes,” which indicates that Title IX does not encompass the issue of gender \nidentity at all. \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 12 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5537\nIV. \n  Having determined that the challenged portions of the Final Rule are invalid, the Court \nconsiders the appropriate remedy.  While the Department argues in favor of severance, the Court \nremains persuaded that the three challenged provisions fatally taint the entire rule.  As the Court \nhas explained, the definition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” lies at the heart of Title IX and \npermeates virtually every provision of the law.   \nWhile not directly challenged in this proceeding, the Final Rule brings new requirements \nfor handling grievances, training, recordkeeping, and processing complaints.  But these regulations \nrefer to and incorporate provisions the Court deems invalid, which necessitates jettisoning these \nregulations  as  well.    See  34  C.F.R.  §§  106.44  (Recipient’s  response  to  sex  discrimination \n(including multiple references to sex-based harassment)); 106.45 (Grievance procedures for the \nprompt  and  equitable  resolution  of  complaints  of  sex  discrimination  (relying  on  §  106.2’s \ndefinition of sex-based harassment)); 106.46 (Grievance procedures for the prompt and equitable \nresolution of complaints of sex-based harassment involving student complainants or student \nrespondents at postsecondary institutions (same)).  While there appears to be at least one provision \nthat is not directly impacted by the plaintiffs’ challenge, see 34 C.F.R. § 106.40 (Aug. 1, 2024) \n(“Parental, family or marital status; pregnancy or related conditions), it simply is not proper for \nthe  Court  to  rewrite  the  regulations  by  excising  the  offending  material,  particularly  when \nrulemaking is the exclusive duty of the Executive Branch.  See Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of \nN. New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006).  Thus, the undersigned concludes that the entire Final Rule \nand corresponding regulations are invalid and must be set aside. \n   “[W]hen a reviewing court declares that the challenged action of an administrative agency \nviolates the law, vacatur is the ‘normal remedy.’”  Kiakombua v. Wolf, 498 F. Supp. 3d 1, 50 \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 13 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5538\n(D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 746 F.3d 1102, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2014)); \nKentucky. v. Fed. Hwy. Admin., 728 F. Supp. 3d 501, 522 (2024) (observing that vacatur is the \nordinary remedy for a violation of the APA).  In essence,  a vacatur order “takes the unlawful \nagency action ‘off the books’”—“an entirely appropriate response when a plaintiff successfully \nestablishes that the agency’s conduct violates the law.”  Kiakomba, 746 F. Supp. 3d at 50 (citations \nomitted).  Vacatur operates on the rule itself and prevents the rule’s “application to all who would \notherwise be subject to its operation.”  See Kentucky, 728 F. Supp. 3d at 522 (quoting East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Garland, 994 F.3d 962, 987 (9th Cir. 2020)). \n  Although the Court has discretion to craft a different remedy, there is no reason to do so \nhere.  “In general, whether vacatur is appropriate depends ‘on the seriousness of the agency error \nand the disruptive consequences of vacatur.’”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 60 F.4th 1008, 1022 (6th Cir. \n2023) (quoting Long Island Power Auth. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm’n, 27 F.4th 705, 717 (D.C. \nCir. 2022)).  The seriousness of the error weighs heavily in favor of vacating the Final Rule, as it \nis unlawful on numerous fronts.  See id. (observing that “the seriousness of the agency’s error \ndepends on how likely it is the agency will be able to justify its decision on remand”) (cleaned up).  \nIn other words, the Department could not adopt the same rule on remand by “offer[ing] better \nreasoning” or “complying with procedural rules.”  See id. (quoting Pollinator Stewardship Council \nv. EPA, 806 F.3d 520, 532 (9th Cir. 2015)). \n  Additionally, vacatur of the Final Rule is not likely to have a disruptive effect.  As far as \nthis Court is aware, every court presented with a challenge to the Final Rule has indicated that it \nis unlawful.  See Alabama v. U.S. Sec. of Educ., No. 24-12444, 2024 WL 3981994 (11th Cir. Aug. \n22, 2024); Oklahoma v. Cardona, No. CIV-24-00461-JD, 2024 WL 3609109 (W.D. Okla. July 31, \n2024); Arkansas v. Dept. of Educ., No. 4:24-CV-636-RWS, 2024 WL 3518588 (E.D. Mo. July 24, \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 14 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5539\n2024); Texas v. United States, No. 2:24-CV-86-Z, 2024 WL 3405342 (N.D. Tex. July 11, 2024); \nKansas v. Dept of Educ., No. 24-4041-JWB, 2024 WL 3273285 (D. Kan. July 2, 2024); Louisiana \nv. Dept. of Educ., No. 3:24-CV-00563, 2024 WL 2978786 (W.D. La. June 13, 2024).  Further, \nvacatur of the Final Rule would simply “cause a return to the status quo” that existed for more than \n50 years prior to its effective date.  See Sierra Club, 60 F.4th at 1023 (concluding that returning to \nthe regulatory regime that had been in place for almost 50 years would not have a disruptive effect). \n  Vacatur of the Final Rule effectively moots the plaintiffs’ request for permanent injunctive \nrelief.  However, Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[t]he existence of \nanother adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.”  \nSee also 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (providing that a court may “declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be \nsought”).  The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief stating that: (1) the Final Rule is unlawful because \nTitle IX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination does not include the bases or conduct covered by § \n106.02’s hostile-environment harassment definition, § 106.10, or § 106.31(a)’s regulation of sex-\nsegregated facilities and programs; (2) the Final Rule is unlawful because it violates the Spending \nClause and the First Amendment; (3) the Final Rule is unlawful because it is arbitrary and \ncapricious; and (4) Plaintiff States, their political subdivisions, and their recipient schools are \nentitled to funding irrespective of compliance with the Rule.   \nThe plaintiffs’ requested declaratory relief is substantially consistent with the Court’s \ndecision and will be granted.  However, the Court will modify the fourth request slightly, as it goes \ntoo far to affirmatively conclude that the plaintiff-States “are entitled to funding irrespective of \ntheir compliance with the Rule.”  After all, the plaintiff-States potentially could violate Title IX in \nways  unrelated  to  the  Final  Rule,  which  might  render  them  ineligible  for  federal  funding.  \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DCR-CJS     Doc #: 143     Filed: 01/09/25     Page: 15 of 15 - Page\nID#: 5540\nAccordingly, a more accurate way to characterize this declaratory relief is that the Plaintiff States, \ntheir political subdivisions, and their recipient schools need not comply with the Rule to receive \nfederal funding. \nV. \nBased on the foregoing analysis, and incorporating the Court’s June 17, 2024 and July 10, \n2024 Memorandum Opinions and Orders [Record Nos. 100, 117] by reference, it is hereby \nORDERED as follows: \n1.

Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and the U.S. Department \nof Education (collectively, the Department) seek a stay of parts of the district court(cid:146)s preliminary \ninjunction with respect to an administrative rule promulgated under Title IX.  For the reasons \nelaborated below, we deny the motion for a stay and expedite the appeal.   \nI. \nThe Rule.  (cid:147)No person in the United States,(cid:148) Title IX says, (cid:147)shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.(cid:148)  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \nThe statute empowers the Department to promulgate rules (cid:147)consistent with achievement of the \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 2\nNo. 24-5588 \n-2- \n \nobjectives of(cid:148) Title IX.  Id. § 1682.  On April 29, 2024, the Department promulgated a Rule under \nTitle IX entitled (cid:147)Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance,(cid:148) 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106).  The Rule is scheduled to go into effect on August 1, 2024.  Id. at 33476. \nThe Rule provides a new definition of (cid:147)[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex(cid:148) under 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.10.  As amended, the Rule covers (cid:147)discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex \ncharacteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.(cid:148)  89 Fed. \nReg.  33886.    The  Rule  also  amends  34  C.F.R.  § 106.2  to  add  a  prohibition  on  (cid:147)[h]ostile \nenvironment harassment,(cid:148) defined as (cid:147)[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality \nof the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it \nlimits or denies a person(cid:146)s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient(cid:146)s education program \nor activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment).(cid:148)  Id. at 33884.  In view of the new scope of sex-\nbased discrimination under § 106.10, this addition to § 106.2 covers the refusal to use a student(cid:146)s \npreferred pronoun.  See id. at 33516.  In addition, the Rule amends 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) to \nclarify that schools may not (cid:147)prevent[] a person from participating in an education program or \nactivity consistent with the person(cid:146)s gender identity.(cid:148)  Id. at 33887.  As a result, § 106.31(a)(2) \napplies to (cid:147)restrooms and locker rooms, access to classes and activities, and policies such as \nappearance codes (including dress and grooming codes).(cid:148)  Id. at 33816 (internal citations omitted).   \nProcedural history.  Four States (Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia) and two \nCommonwealths (Kentucky and Virginia) filed this lawsuit against the Department to block \nenforcement of the Rule.  They claim that § 106.10 (cid:147)contravenes Title IX(cid:146)s text and the meaning \nof  the  Department(cid:146)s  own  regulations,(cid:148)  that  § 106.2  runs  afoul  of  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments, and that the Rule generally violates the Spending Clause, exceeds the agency(cid:146)s \nauthority, and turns on arbitrary and capricious rulemaking.  R.1 at 70.  Soon after the States filed \nthis  lawsuit,  the  Christian  Educators  Association  International,  a  voluntary  membership \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 3\nNo. 24-5588 \n-3- \n \norganization comprised of Christians in the teaching profession, intervened to support the action.  \nSo too did A.C., a fifteen-year-old middle school student in West Virginia.  She complained that \na student who was assigned male at birth but identifies as female was allowed to compete against, \nand share facilities with, A.C. and the rest of the girls(cid:146) track and field team.  The intervenors \nchallenged § 106.2 on First Amendment grounds and § 106.31(a)(2)(cid:146)s inclusivity mandate as \nviolating students(cid:146) and school employees(cid:146) rights to bodily privacy, safety, and sporting integrity. \nThe  plaintiffs  moved  the  district  court  for  a  preliminary  injunction  preventing  the \nDepartment from enforcing the Rule.  In a thorough 93-page opinion, the district court granted the \nmotion and enjoined the Rule in its entirety.  The Department appealed. \nThe Department moved the district court for a stay of one aspect of its merits ruling and a \npartial stay of the scope of the injunction pending appeal.  As to the merits, the Department \nchallenged the court(cid:146)s decision that § 106.10(cid:146)s new definition of sex discrimination violated the \nstatute.  As to the court(cid:146)s other legal conclusions(cid:151)the Rule(cid:146)s provisions, for example, regarding \n(cid:147)sex-separated bathrooms(cid:148) and (cid:147)sex-specific pronouns(cid:148)(cid:151)the Department accepted them for the \ntime being, namely during the pendency of the appeal.   R.104 at 1.  In addition, the Department \nmaintained that the district court should have issued a narrower injunction, one that enjoined just \n(i) 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2), and (ii) 34 C.F.R. § 106.2(cid:146)s definition of (cid:147)hostile environment \nharassment(cid:148) as applied to (cid:147)discrimination on the basis of gender identity.(cid:148)  R.104 at 2.  The \nDepartment asked the district court to stay the preliminary injunction as to all other provisions of \nthe Rule, including § 106.10(cid:146)s new definition of sex discrimination.  In yet another thorough \nopinion, this one 26 pages long, the district court rejected the motion for a partial stay.  It did not \nhave any second thoughts about its § 106.10 ruling, making it inappropriate to limit the preliminary \ninjunction to §§ 106.2 and 106.31(a).  And it reasoned that the only way to address the plaintiffs(cid:146) \nharms given the interconnected nature of the definition of sex discrimination with respect to the \nother key provisions was to enjoin the Rule in its entirety.   \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 4\nNo. 24-5588 \n-4- \n \nThe Department now seeks similar relief from us on an expedited basis.     \nII. \nFour factors guide the stay inquiry:  (1) likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable \nharm to the plaintiffs; (3) harm to others; and (4) the public interest.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 434 (2009).  Granting a stay pending appeal is always (cid:147)an exercise of judicial discretion,(cid:148) \nand (cid:147)not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.(cid:148)  Id. at 433 (quotation \nomitted). \nLikelihood of success.  With respect to the first factor, the Department premises its stay \nmotion on (1) one aspect of the district court(cid:146)s analysis of the underlying claims and (2) the scope \nof the injunction.  As for the underlying legal claim, the Department argues that the district court \nlikely erred in assessing the validity of § 106.10(cid:146)s definition of sex discrimination.  As for the \nscope of the injunction, it claims that the district court likely erred in extending the injunction \nbeyond § 106.2 and § 106.31(a).  We consider each argument in turn.   \nStart with the definition of sex discrimination under Title IX.  As we see it, the district \ncourt likely concluded correctly that the Rule(cid:146)s definition of sex discrimination exceeds the \nDepartment(cid:146)s authority.  In defining (cid:147)discrimination on the basis of sex(cid:148) in Title IX to extend to \ndiscrimination on the basis of (cid:147)gender identity,(cid:148) among other categories, § 106.10, 89 Fed. Reg. \n33886, the Department mainly relied on Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 669 (2020).  \nBut Bostock is a Title VII case.  As many jurists have explained, Title VII(cid:146)s definition of \ndiscrimination, together with the employment-specific defenses that come with it, do not neatly \nmap onto other areas of discrimination.  See, e.g., Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President \n&  Fellows  of  Harvard  Coll.,  600  U.S.  181,  290,  308  (2023)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring) \n(distinguishing the Equal Protection Clause from Titles VI and VII); Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. \nBd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 808 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc); Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of \nAla., 80 F.4th 1205, 1229 (11th Cir. 2023); Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, No. 21-2875, 2022 \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 5\nNo. 24-5588 \n-5- \n \nWL 16957734, at *1 n.1 (8th Cir. Nov. 16, 2022) (Stras, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc).  Title VII(cid:146)s definition of sex discrimination under Bostock simply does not mean the same \nthing for other anti-discrimination mandates, whether under the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI, \nor Title IX. \nAs to the relationship between Title VII and Title IX, the statutes use materially different \nlanguage:  discrimination (cid:147)because of(cid:148) sex in Title VII and discrimination (cid:147)on the basis of(cid:148) sex in \nTitle IX.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(cid:150)2(a)(1); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  In addition, the two statutes serve \ndifferent goals and have distinct defenses.  For these reasons, (cid:147)it does not follow that principles \nannounced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context.(cid:148)  Meriwether v. \nHartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021).  No less importantly, Congress enacted Title IX as \nan exercise of its Spending Clause power, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, which means that Congress \nmust speak with a clear voice before it imposes new mandates on the States.  See Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999); Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  The same is not true of Title VII.  See Fitzpatrick v. \nBitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 452(cid:150)453 & n.9 (1976).  All of this explains why we have been skeptical of \nattempts to export Title VII(cid:146)s expansive meaning of sex discrimination to other settings.  See, e.g., \nL.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 484 (6th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom. United States \nv. Skrmetti, No. 23-477, 2024 WL 3089532 (U.S. June 24, 2024) (Equal Protection Clause); Gore \nv. Lee, No. 23-5669, __ F.4th __, 2024 WL 3385247, at *5 (6th Cir. July 12, 2024) (same); Pelcha \nv. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act). \nAll three members of the panel, it bears emphasis, agree that these central provisions of the \nRule should not be allowed to go into effect on August 1.  Our modest disagreement turns on the \nquestion, in this emergency setting, of whether the other parts of the Rule can be separated from \nthese central provisions. \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 6\nNo. 24-5588 \n-6- \n \nTurn, then, to the scope of the preliminary injunction.  As just shown, we disagree with the \nkey premise of the Department(cid:146)s scope-of-the-injunction argument:  its position that the court \nshould not have extended the injunction to § 106.10(cid:146)s new definition of sex discrimination.  Our \nreasoning shows at a minimum that the preliminary injunction properly extends to three central \nprovisions of the Rule:  §§ 106.10, 106.2(cid:146)s definition of hostile environment harassment, and \n106.31(a).   \nAfter that, the problem is that these provisions, particularly the new definition of sex \ndiscrimination, appear to touch every substantive provision of the Rule.  It is thus unsurprising, as \nthe Department fairly acknowledges, that there are (cid:147)numerous(cid:148) references to sex discrimination \nthroughout the Rule.  Dep(cid:146)t Supp. Br. 3.  In reality, each of the remaining provisions that the \nDepartment seeks to implement on August 1 implicates the new definition of sex discrimination.  \nTake the Rule(cid:146)s record-keeping provision, § 106.8(f), which requires schools to preserve any \nnotice  sent  to  the  Title  IX  coordinator  of  (cid:147)conduct  that  reasonably  may  constitute  sex \ndiscrimination,(cid:148) as well as the investigation and grievance records for (cid:147)each complaint of sex \ndiscrimination.(cid:148)  89 Fed. Reg. 33886.  Or § 106.2(cid:146)s definition of sex-based harassment, which \namounts to (cid:147)a form of sex discrimination . . . including on the bases identified in § 106.10, that \n[includes] . . . [h]ostile environment harassment.(cid:148)  Id. at 33884.  Or § 106.8, which imposes \nvarious new obligations on schools to comply with the new sex discrimination requirements:  \nappointing Title IX coordinators, requiring training on the new scope of sex discrimination, and \nthe like.  Id. at 33885.  Or § 106.11, which clarifies that the Rule generally requires schools to \nrespond to sex discrimination in the United States and sometimes to sex discrimination elsewhere.  \nId. at 33886.  Or § 106.40, which requires Title IX coordinators to (cid:147)promptly and effectively \nprevent sex discrimination(cid:148) by taking actions like ensuring access to lactation spaces.  Id. at \n33887(cid:150)88.  Or § 106.44, which requires any funding recipient (cid:147)with knowledge of conduct that \nreasonably may constitute sex discrimination(cid:148) to respond promptly with a series of corrective \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 7\nNo. 24-5588 \n-7- \n \nmeasures.  Id. at 33888.  Or the Rule(cid:146)s grievance procedures and retaliation provision, §§ 106.45(cid:150)\n.46, .71, which impose new rules for dealing with complaints of sex discrimination, sex-based \nharassment, and retaliation for reporting the same.  Id. at 33891(cid:150)96.   \nThrough it all, each of the provisions that the Department wishes to begin enforcing on \nAugust 1 implicates the new definition of sex discrimination.  It is hard to see how all of the schools \ncovered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new obligations if the Rule(cid:146)s definition \nof sex discrimination remains enjoined.  Harder still, we question how the schools could properly \ntrain their teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with so little time before the start of the \nnew school year. \nThe Department resists this conclusion.  It argues that the schools could enforce these \nprovisions by relying on the prior definition of sex discrimination under its rules and regulations.  \nIf we denied the stay only as to the three core provisions identified above, the Department thus \nhypothesizes, the pre-existing definition could govern the rest of the Rule on August 1.  We see a \nfew problems with this argument.  One is that we do not know the meaning of that pre-existing \ndefinition.  As the Department points out, even that definition is (cid:147)the subject of separate litigation.(cid:148)  \nDep(cid:146)t Supp. Br. 3 n.1 (citing Tennessee v. Dep(cid:146)t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577 (6th Cir. 2024)).  Another \nproblem is that the Department has not identified any evidence that it contemplated, during the \nrulemaking process, how the remainder of the Rule would apply without any of its core provisions.  \nYes, there are severability provisions that would apply to the Rule, and the Department considered \nthe possibility that a court might sever § 106.10 from the rest of the Rule.  89 Fed. Reg. 33848.  \nBut it did not contemplate enforcement of the Rule without any of the core provisions.  Nor is \nthere any suggestion that the cost-benefit analyses underlying the Rule contemplated the idea of \nallowing these provisions to go into effect with a different definition of sex discrimination. \nIn addition, it bears emphasizing how the Department framed its arguments below.  The \nDepartment, to be sure, did identify the severability provisions.  But it mainly used them to permit \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 8\nNo. 24-5588 \n-8- \n \nthe new definition of sex discrimination to go into effect, not to allow other provisions to go into \neffect under the prior definition of sex discrimination.  In fact, the Department mentioned \nseverability below in just a few lines of its briefs without telling the district court which other \nprovisions should be severed.  At least in the context of this emergency stay motion, we are \nuncomfortable granting more relief than the Department sought below.  As shown, all of the \nprovisions  the  Department  now  asks  to  go  into  effect  implicate  the  new  definition  of  sex \ndiscrimination. \nThe  other  stay  factors.    The  equities,  too,  favor  this  approach.    From  an  equitable \nperspective, educators should not be forced to determine whether this or that section of the new \nRule must be followed when the new definition of sex discrimination might or might not touch the \nRule.  The States presented evidence that rolling out hundreds of pages of a new rule on August 1, \njust before the start of the school year, will place an onerous burden on them(cid:151)loads of time and \nlots of costs that will only escalate if we leave confusion over the States(cid:146) obligations under the \nRule.  That is particularly problematic given that the new definition of sex discrimination affects \neach provision of the Rule that the Department asked to go into immediate effect. \nThe States, to be sure, have acknowledged that some technical provisions of the Rule do \nnot necessarily implicate the new definition of sex discrimination and are not already covered by \nprior regulations.  But the Department did not identify these provisions in its request for relief.  \nAnd with good reason, it appears.  The provisions merely include definitions of four terms \n((cid:147)parental status,(cid:148) (cid:147)party,(cid:148) (cid:147)pregnancy or related conditions,(cid:148) and (cid:147)student with a disability(cid:148)), as \nwell as eight technical amendments to existing Title IX regulations.  See States(cid:146) Supp. Br. 25 \n(citing § 106.3 [Amended]; § 106.15 (amending existing § 106.15); § 106.16 [Removed]; § 106.17 \n[Removed];  § 106.18  [Redesignated  as  § 106.16];  § 106.41  [Amended]  (removing  existing \n§ 106.41(d));  § 106.46  [Redesignated  as  § 106.48];  and  § 106.51  [Employment]  (amending \nexisting § 106.51(b)(6))).  Although a merits panel is free to consider whether the scope of the \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 9\nNo. 24-5588 \n-9- \n \ninjunction should be narrowed to permit these technical provisions to go forward, the Department \nat this stage has not identified any harms that come from the preliminary injunction(cid:146)s coverage of \nthese particular provisions.  For that reason, and with the goal of avoiding any confusion that would \ncome from enjoining all but the most technical portions of the Rule on the eve of a new school \nyear, we will not exercise our (cid:147)judicial discretion(cid:148) to grant a stay on these points.  Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 433.   \nWe therefore deny the motion to stay the district court(cid:146)s preliminary injunction.  To \nmitigate any harm to the Department, we will expedite its appeal of the district court(cid:146)s issuance of \na preliminary injunction and direct the Clerk(cid:146)s Office to set a briefing schedule so that the case \nmay be heard by a randomly assigned argument merits panel during the October sitting. \n \n \nMATHIS, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  The U.S. Department of Education promulgated an \nadministrative rule under Title IX called (cid:147)Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance,(cid:148) 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, \n2024).  The Rule, which is set to take effect on August 1, 2024, adds or revises dozens of Title IX \nregulations.  The State and Intervenor Plaintiffs take issue with three provisions that they say \nconstitute a (cid:147)gender-identity mandate(cid:148) and have sought, among other things, injunctive relief.  The \ndistrict court preliminarily enjoined the entire Rule.  The Department seeks to stay part of the \npreliminary injunction pending appeal.  Because I would grant the Department(cid:146)s motion in part, I \nrespectfully dissent. \nFor decades, Title IX has stood as a bulwark against discrimination in education.  It states \nthat (cid:147)[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance,(cid:148) with few exceptions.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Congress has \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 10\nNo. 24-5588 \n-10- \n \nauthorized the Department to issue rules and regulations that are (cid:147)consistent with achievement of \nthe objectives of(cid:148) Title IX.  Id. § 1682.  The Department passed the Rule pursuant to that authority. \nThe Rule (cid:147)amends the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972.(cid:148)    89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33474.    In  addition  to  changes  like  revising  the  record-keeping \nrequirements in 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(f), 89 Fed. Reg. at 33886, and adding a requirement in 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.40  that  schools provide accommodations and facilities for breastfeeding  students  and \nemployees,  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33887(cid:150)88,  the  Rule  made  amendments  intended  to  address \ndiscrimination based on gender identity.   \nPlaintiffs focused their requests for injunctive relief on three provisions in the Rule.   One \nprovision defines (cid:147)[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex(cid:148) to include (cid:147)discrimination on the basis of \nsex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender \nidentity.(cid:148)  34 C.F.R. § 106.10.  The second provision defines (cid:147)[s]ex-based harassment(cid:148) as: \na form of sex discrimination and means sexual harassment and other \nharassment on the basis of sex, including on the bases described in \n§ 106.10, that is: \n. . .  \n \n(2)  Hostile  environment  harassment.    Unwelcome  sex-based \nconduct  that,  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  is \nsubjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive \nthat it limits or denies a person(cid:146)s ability to participate in or benefit \nfrom the recipient(cid:146)s education program or activity (i.e., creates a \nhostile environment).  \n \nId. § 106.2.  The third provision prohibits sex separation or differentiation that causes more than \nde minimis harm: \nIn the limited circumstances in which Title IX or this part permits \ndifferent treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must \nnot carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than \nde minimis harm, except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) \nthrough (9) and the corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 through \n106.15,  20  U.S.C.  1686  and  its  corresponding  regulation  § \n106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b).  Adopting a policy or engaging in a \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 11\nNo. 24-5588 \n-11- \n \npractice that prevents a person from participating in an education \nprogram or activity consistent with the person(cid:146)s gender identity \nsubjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2).  These provisions, according to Plaintiffs, constitute the Rule(cid:146)s gender-\nidentity mandate. \nThe Department included severability statements in each of the subparts where the three \nabove-mentioned provisions are located.  Those statements provide: (cid:147)If any provision of this \nsubpart or its application to any person, act, or practice is held invalid, the remainder of the subpart \nor applications of its provision to any person, act, or practice shall not be affected thereby.(cid:148)  Id.  \n§§ 106.9, 106.16, 106.48.   \nThe Department appeals and moves for a partial stay of the injunction to allow the Rule to \ntake effect except as to the three provisions expressly challenged by Plaintiffs.  This court considers \nfour factors when deciding whether to stay a district court(cid:146)s injunction: (1) the likelihood that the \nmovant will succeed on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the movant will suffer \nirreparable harm absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will cause substantial harm to others; and (4) \nwhether a stay serves the public interest.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  (cid:147)These factors \nare not prerequisites that must be met, but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced \ntogether.(cid:148)  Mich. Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th \nCir. 1991).  Still, the first two factors (cid:147)are the most critical.(cid:148)  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  The movant \nmust show more than a (cid:147)possibility(cid:148) of irreparable injury, id. at 434(cid:150)35, and even if a movant can \ndemonstrate irreparable harm, (cid:147)he is still required to show, at a minimum, serious questions going \nto the merits,(cid:148) Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at 153(cid:150)54 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nI would grant the Department(cid:146)s motion and limit the injunction to the provisions Plaintiffs \nchallenge.  The Department is likely to succeed on the merits for those provisions that Plaintiffs \nhave not challenged.  The Supreme Court has cautioned lower courts that (cid:147)[a] plaintiff(cid:146)s remedy \nmust be tailored to redress the plaintiff(cid:146)s particular injury,(cid:148) Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 73 \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 12\nNo. 24-5588 \n-12- \n \n(2018), and (cid:147)limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has \nestablished,(cid:148) id. at 68 (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)).  To that end, (cid:147)a federal \ncourt may not issue an equitable remedy (cid:145)more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to \n[redress](cid:146) the plaintiff(cid:146)s injuries.(cid:148)  Labrador v. Poe ex rel. Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 923 (2024) (mem.) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (alteration in original) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n(1979)).  An injunction can (cid:147)stray[] from equity(cid:146)s traditional bounds(cid:148) by barring the enforcement \nof provisions that do not harm the plaintiffs.  Id.  That is precisely what has happened here. \nThe parties and the district court spend considerable time discussing whether § 106.10 is \nconsistent with the Supreme Court(cid:146)s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 669 \n(2020), which held that (cid:147)discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily \nentails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.(cid:148)  But we need not \nresolve  that  debate  to  determine  that  the  district  court(cid:146)s  preliminary  injunction  preventing \nenforcement of the entire Rule is broader than necessary to prevent Plaintiffs(cid:146) alleged irreparable \nharms.  Gill, 585 U.S. at 68; Poe, 144 S. Ct. at 923 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Enjoining only those \nprovisions targeted by Plaintiffs(cid:146) injunction motions would be sufficient.   \nIs the Department irreparably harmed by an enjoining the Rule even though Plaintiffs only \nchallenge three provisions of the Rule?  I believe so.  The purpose of the Rule was (cid:147)to fully \neffectuate Title IX(cid:146)s sex discrimination prohibition.(cid:148)  89 Fed. Reg. at 33476.  Through their \nmotions for preliminary injunctions, Plaintiffs challenged the lawfulness of the three supposed \ngender-identity-mandate provisions.  The Department is irreparably harmed by the interference \nwith its rule-making authority, which it uses to protect students from sex discrimination.  See \nMaryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers); Cannon v. Univ. of \nChi., 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979).   \nThe harm to Plaintiffs is lessened because the provisions of the Rule that they have \nchallenged would remain enjoined.  Thus, a partial stay would advance Title IX(cid:146)s core purpose of \n\nCase: 24-5588     Document: 41-1     Filed: 07/17/2024     Page: 13\nNo. 24-5588 \n-13- \n \neliminating sex-based discrimination in education while still preventing the irreparable harms \nenumerated by Plaintiffs.  As it relates to the Rule(cid:146)s definition of sex discrimination in § 106.10, \nthere is no reason the Department could not use its pre-Rule understanding of what constitutes sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX. \n  I am cognizant of Plaintiffs(cid:146) argument that the benefits of enacting the Rule(cid:146)s unchallenged \nprovisions are outweighed by the expense or confusion of phased implementation.  But most of \nthe expense is attributable to provisions that Plaintiffs neither directly challenge nor cite as a source \nof harm.   \nInjunctive relief should be tailored, specific, and no broader than necessary.  The district \ncourt(cid:146)s preliminary injunction does not satisfy those requirements.  Therefore, I would stay the \ninjunction except for prohibiting the Department from enforcing the three provisions Plaintiffs \nhave challenged.  Because the majority holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.  \n \n            ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT \n \n \n \n \n \n            Kelly L.

For fifty years, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act has helped equalize \nwomen’s access to educational facilities and programs by barring discrimination “on the basis of \nsex” by schools receiving federal funds.  At the same time, given the “enduring” physical differ-\nences between men and women, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), Title IX has \nalways allowed the nation’s schools to divide private spaces and participation on sports teams by \nsex.  Yet through unprecedented new regulations, the U.S. Department of Education now seeks to \ntwist Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination into a mandate that schools protect and promote \ntheir students’ “gender identity,” among other “sex characteristics.”  Exhibit A, U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Fed-\neral Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024).

Congress enacted Title IX to remedy historic and persistent sex-based discrimina-\ntion in education, including by promoting equal opportunity for women in the educational sphere.  \nTitle IX does so by barring recipients of federal educational funding from engaging in discrimina-\ntion “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added).   \n3.  All of the tools of statutory interpretation support reading this provision as barring \ndiscrimination based on sex, not the distinct term “gender identity” and associated theories.  See \nOhio v. Becerra, 87 F.4th 759, 769 (6th Cir. 2023) (“The traditional tools of construction include \nconsideration of a statute’s text, structure, history, and purpose.” (cleaned up)); Bostock v. Clayton \nCnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (explaining that courts “normally interpret[] a statute in accord \nwith the ordinary public meaning of its terms at the time of its enactment”).   \n4.  Federal courts across the country have recognized that the ordinary public meaning \nof “sex” at the time of Title IX’s enactment referred to the biological distinction between male and \nfemale.  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 817 (11th Cir. 2022) \n(en banc); Bridge ex rel. Bridge v. Okla. State Dep’t of Educ., No. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 WL \n150598, at *8 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2024); Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668, 684 (N.D. Tex. \n2022); D.H. by A.H. v. Williamson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 638 F. Supp. 3d 821, 835-36 (M.D. Tenn. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 3 of 83 - Page ID#: 3\n \n2022); cf. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 632-33 (4th Cir. 2020) (Niemeyer, \nJ., dissenting).   \n5.  Additional textual clues, such as Title IX’s consistent treatment of “sex” as binary, \nsupport this reading.  For example, § 1681(a)(2) delays Title IX’s application to an institution in \nthe process of “changing from being an institution which admits only students of one sex” to being \n“an institution which admits students of both sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (emphasis added). \n6.  The statute’s structure likewise indicates that Title IX proscribes practices that treat \nwomen worse than men, and vice versa—not sex-differentiation based on inherent differences be-\ntween the sexes.  For one thing, Title IX expressly authorizes sex-segregated living spaces and \nprograms by stating it does not “prohibit any educational institution … from maintaining separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686—a provision included to protect “per-\nsonal privacy.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (1972) (statement of Sen. Bayh).  And many of Title IX’s \nexclusions from coverage preserve female-only spaces—a choice that would have no meaning if \n“sex” is a fluid concept.  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (exempting college sorority membership \npractices and service organizations like the Girl Scouts).   \n7.  The historical evidence overwhelmingly confirms this reading of Title IX.  Just a \nsampling: The statute arose from seven days of U.S. House hearings examining the problem of \n“discrimination against women.”  See Hearings Before the Special Subcommittee on Education of \nthe Committee on Education and Labor House of Representatives on Section 805 of H.R. 16098, \n91st Cong. 1-2 (1970) (statement of Rep. Green).  And the bill’s Senate sponsor, Birch Bayh, \ncalled the proposed Title IX legislation “[t]he only antidote” to “the continuation of corrosive and \nunjustified discrimination against women . . . in[] all facets of education.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5,803.  \nAt the same time, Senator Bayh stressed that Title IX did not “desegregate” anything, but merely \n3 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 4 of 83 - Page ID#: 4\n \n“provide[d] equal access for women and men students to the educational process and extracurric-\nular activities in school.”  117 Cong. Rec. 30,407 (1971). \n8.  The Department of Education and its predecessor agency have historically and con-\nsistently interpreted “sex” to refer to a binary male-female distinction.  This position began in \n1975—with Title IX’s original implementing regulations—and persisted until the early days of \nPresident Barack Obama’s second term.  And Congress chose to retain the relevant statutory text \nwhen it amended Title IX in 1987 to encompass all educational programs.  Civil Rights Restoration \nAct of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988).  Given the uniform and well-known status \nof Title IX’s regulatory history, that indicates that Congress embraced the long-standing practices \nand precedents greenlighting sex-separation in the nation’s schools.  See Franklin v. Gwinnett \nCnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 73 (1992) (drawing a similar inference from the Act’s failure to \noverturn an intervening U.S. Supreme Court precedent interpreting Title IX). \n9.  Against this avalanche of evidence regarding Title IX’s plain scope, President \nBiden’s Department of Education has finalized a new Title IX rule that fundamentally alters the \nmeaning of Title IX’s bar on sex discrimination.  The rule, which takes effect on August 1, 2024, \ndeclares that “sex” is an expansive concept whose bounds it need not define.  Instead, under the \nDepartment’s view, unlawful “sex discrimination” covers “any discrimination that depends” even \n“in part on consideration of a person’s sex,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,803, including but not limited to \n“discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related condi-\ntions, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” id. at 33,886 (adding 34 C.FR. § 106.10).   \n10.  The Department pursued this Title IX overhaul despite Congress’s repeated refusal \nto expand Title IX’s coverage beyond “sex.”  See, e.g., Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2015, \n4 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 5 of 83 - Page ID#: 5\n \nS. 439, 114th Cong. (2015).1  The result is unauthorized lawmaking by regulators set on carrying \nout the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach to “prohibit[ing] discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023, \n7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).     \n11.  The Final Rule’s distorted definition of sex has radical ramifications.  Start with \nschools’ ubiquitous distinctions between male and female areas—in bathrooms, locker rooms, \nchanging facilities, and the like.  Now, drawing these lines is illegal discrimination unless schools \npermit persons to access even private spaces “consistent with their gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,887 (amending 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)); see also id. at 33,816-17, 33,818-20.  The Final Rule, \nmoreover, says the “person[s]” Title IX protects include anyone “participating or attempting to \nparticipate” in the recipient’s program or activity, including students from other schools, visiting \nlecturers, and invited community members.  Id. at 33,816 (emphasis added).  And it prohibits \nschools from making any inquiries or requiring any evidence before allowing access based on a \nperson’s self-professed gender identity.  Id. at 33,819.   The upshot:  Just about any person on a \nschool’s campus can use the private facilities reserved for the sex of their choice, no questions \nasked.  Id. at 33,816, 33,818.   \n12.  Despite the Department’s best efforts to muddy the issue, the Final Rule’s gender-\nidentity mandate also will invalidate scores of States’ and schools’ sex-separated sports policies.  \nAs President Biden’s administration has consistently argued, and as the Final Rule suggests, the \n \n1 See also Ryan T. Anderson, On the Basis of Identity: Redefining “Sex” in Civil Rights \nLaw and Faulty Accounts of “Discrimination”, 43 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 387, 387 & n.5 (2020). \n5 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 6 of 83 - Page ID#: 6\n \nDepartment’s reading of Title IX will not allow schools to enforce a generally applicable rule \nprohibiting males who identify as females from playing on female sports teams.  Id. at 33,817.   \n13.  Instead, the Department’s discussion of athletics confirms that schools can lawfully \nexclude men from women’s sports teams only in limited circumstances yet to be determined.  To \njustify this differential treatment of sports, the Final Rule unveils the eleventh-hour justification \nthat Title IX’s regulations “have always permitted” sex-separate athletic teams.  Id. at 33,819; see \nalso id. 33,816-17 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)).  But that reasoning would apply equally to the \nsingle-sex bathrooms and locker rooms that those regulations have likewise permitted from the \nstart but that the Final Rule now deems discriminatory against transgender students, among others.  \nSee infra ¶¶ 148-49; see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.33-.34.  That the Final Rule must draw dubious \ndistinctions to avoid illogical consequences indicts the Department’s approach of preferencing \nsubjective gender-identity theory over the women Title IX aims to protect.   \n14.  The Final Rule then compounds its erroneous reading of sex discrimination by \nadopting an expansive definition of what counts as prohibited “harassment” for Title IX purposes.  \nUnder the Final Rule, repercussions risk running to any speech or religious expression that might \nreasonably be deemed “unwelcome,” “offensive,” and “limit[ing]” of a student’s educational par-\nticipation or benefits.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (amending 34 C.F.R. § 106.2); see also id. at 33,562.  \nBut the Sixth Circuit and other courts have concluded that the First Amendment protects students’ \nand faculty’s prerogative not to “communicat[e] messages about gender identity [they] believe[] \nare false,” including using “a pronoun that reflects a student’s self-asserted gender identity” rather \nthan sex.  Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 498-99, 512-13 (6th Cir. 2021).  Yet instead of \ngrappling with the clear constitutional implications of the Final Rule’s contrary harassment guide-\nlines, the Department punts any First Amendment problems to resolution on a case-by-case basis.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 7 of 83 - Page ID#: 7\n \nThe resulting regime is cold comfort to the teachers and students who now must toe the line of \ngender-identity directives or risk Title IX sanctions.         \n15.  In short, the Department has used rulemaking power to convert a law designed to \nequalize opportunities for both sexes into a far broader regime of its own making.  Under the Final \nRule, those who “identify as LGBQTI+” must receive access to spaces reserved to members of the \nopposite sex.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,808, 33,816-17, 33,818-20.  Men who identify as women will, \namong other things, have the right to compete within programs and activities that Congress made \navailable to women so they can fairly and fully pursue academic and athletic excellence—turning \nTitle IX’s protections on their head.  And anyone who expresses disagreement with this new status \nquo risks Title IX discipline for prohibited harassment.   \n16.  Title IX does not authorize such sweeping steps.  At the very least, it does not do \nso in the clear manner required to impose Spending-Clause conditions on congressional funding \nor to override States’ traditional prerogatives to set school policy.  The lack of clear congressional \nauthorization for the Final Rule’s unprecedented gender-identity mandate also requires invalidat-\ning the rule under the major-questions doctrine. \n17.  Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia and tens of thousands \nof other commenters opposed the Department’s approach for these and many additional reasons.2  \nYet in adopting the Final Rule, the Department failed to respond to many commenters’ critiques—\nlet alone with adequate explanations or substantial supporting evidence.  But it is Administrative \n \n2 Exhibit B, Jonathan Skrmetti, Letter to Miguel Cardona, ED-2021-OCR-0166-218129 \n(Sept. 12, 2022) [hereinafter Tennessee Facilities-and-Programs Comment]; Exhibit C, Jonathan \nSkrmetti, Letter to Miguel Cardona, ED-2022-OCR-0143-148789 (May 15, 2023) [hereinafter \nTennessee Athletics Comment]; Exhibit D, Todd Rokita, Letter to Miguel Cardona, ED-2022-\nOCR-0143-150756 (May 15, 2023) [hereinafter Indiana Athletics Comment]. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 8 of 83 - Page ID#: 8\n \nLaw 101 that agencies must offer well-reasoned decision-making to support their regulations, not \ndodge important aspects of the problem or draw arbitrary lines for political reasons.  The Final \nRule flunks this baseline limit on the Department’s rulemaking authority.  \n18.  Absent this Court’s immediate intervention, the Final Rule will inflict severe irrep-\narable harm on the States, their educational programs and policies, and their citizens.   \n19.  Tennessee is a case in point.  State law is replete with duly enacted policies that \nconflict with the Department’s new Title IX reading.  By a combination of law and policy, Ten-\nnessee schools generally require sex-separated participation in sports.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-\n6-310(a); Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, 2023-24 TSSAA Handbook (July 18, \n2023), https://perma.cc/KG36-4JLZ [hereinafter TSSAA Handbook].  Tennessee law does not \nmandate that any educational institution defer to students’ gender identity in matters such as bath-\nroom or facility access.  Cf. Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 49-2-802(2), 803(a) (providing that a public \nschool may accommodate a student’s desire for greater privacy when using a sex-specific restroom \nor facility by offering a single-occupancy option).  And Tennessee protects the rights of students \nand faculty to express even “offensive” ideas in the classroom, see Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-7-2405, \nincluding ideas whose expression might run afoul of the Final Rule’s capacious conception of \n“harassment.”  The Final Rule thus forces Tennessee to choose between enforcing its own laws \nand losing about $1.5 billion in federal funds on which important programs at every level of Ten-\nnessee education depend.  On top of that, Tennessee’s laws place it at risk of Title IX suits by \nprivate plaintiffs seeking to recover under the Department’s gender-identity mandate.  \n20.  The other Plaintiff States face the same choice between following duly enacted pol-\nicies that protect students’ privacy and girls’ fair participation in athletics, on the one hand, and \nforfeiting  billions  in  federal  educational  funding  on  the  other.    See,  e.g.,  Ky.  Rev.  Stat. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 9 of 83 - Page ID#: 9\n \n156.070(2)(g) (directing that a student’s sex for the purpose of determining eligibility for inter-\nscholastic athletics shall be determined by the student’s biological sex, and prohibiting males from \nparticipating in any athletic activity or team designated for girls in grades six through twelve); Ky. \nRev. Stat. § 164.2813 (providing the same for postsecondary institutions); see also infra ¶¶ 206, \n208.  \n21.  Because the Final Rule is set to take effect in mere months, all Plaintiff States also \nface imminent, unrecoverable compliance expenses and risk of liability in private suits.  These \ncompliance sums and efforts will be substantial—as the Final Rule itself acknowledges.   \n22.  The Plaintiff States now seek this Court’s intervention to protect their interests and \nconstitutional principles, under which Congress—not unelected members of the Department of \nEducation—has exclusive power to pass and amend laws that apply nationwide.  This Court should \nstay the Final Rule’s effective date and enjoin its enforcement pending judicial review, and ulti-\nmately issue final relief vacating and setting aside the Final Rule in its entirety.  \nPARTIES \n23.

Together, Defendants are referred to as the “Department.” \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n32.  This Court has federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the \nPlaintiff States challenge the Secretary and the Department’s actions under the Administrative \nProcedure Act’s provision for judicial review of agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and other federal \nlaw, see 20 U.S.C. § 1683 (providing for judicial review of “agency action” effectuating Title IX).   \n33.  This Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346 because this case involves \na claim against an agency and employee of the federal government. \n34.  An actual controversy exists between the parties under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n11 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 12 of 83 - Page ID#: 12\n \n35.  This Court has authority to grant Plaintiff States’ requested relief and other appro-\npriate relief under 5 U.S.C. §§ 705-06, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 (the Declaratory Judgment Act), and \nits inherent equitable powers. \n36.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  Defendants are \nUnited States agencies and officers sued in their official capacities.  Plaintiff Commonwealth of \nKentucky is a resident of every judicial district in its sovereign territory, including this judicial \ndistrict and division. \n37.   The Covington Division of the Eastern District of Kentucky is a proper division \nfor this action because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred in the \ndivision, Kentucky’s Attorney General maintains a physical office in Covington, Kentucky, and \nno defendant resides in the Commonwealth.  The Final Rule purposely regulates schools and other \nTitle IX recipients across the country, including those located in the Plaintiff States.  This Court \nthus has personal jurisdiction over the Secretary for purposes of this action because his immunity \nhas been abrogated by 5 U.S.C. § 702 and he has “submi[tted]” to such jurisdiction “through con-\ntact with and” regulatory “activity directed at” Plaintiff States and their schools.

The leadup to Title IX’s passage indisputably reflects a congressional aim to rectify \na “history of sex discrimination” against women in the educational sphere.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at \n531 (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684 (1973)).   \n12 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 13 of 83 - Page ID#: 13\n \n39.   Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in “program[s] \nor activit[ies] receiving Federal financial assistance” “on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin.”  See Pub. L. No. 88-352, tit. VI, 78 Stat. 252 (1964) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000d).  But \nthe law did not include “sex” as a protected ground.  Id. \n40.  By the early 1970s, many recognized that “women still face[d] pervasive, although \nat times more subtle, discrimination in [American] educational institutions,” Frontiero, 411 U.S. \nat 686, including those that received federal funds.   \n41.  Women’s college and graduate-school enrollment lagged behind their male peers.  \n118 Cong. Rec. 5,804, 5,805; Title IX & Gender Equity in Science, Technology, Engineering and \nMathematics, 31 J.C. & U.L. 291, 293-95 (2005).  Many schools remained closed to women or \nrequired them to meet higher admissions standards.  Katie Lew, Unbalanced: The Case for Re-\nmoving Title IX’s Private College Admissions Exemption, 70 Duke L.J. 847, 855-56 & n.48 (2021).   \n42.  Moreover, female college students were often excluded from “male” disciplines \nand activities, id. at 855 n.38, and only about 30,000 women participated in college athletics versus \n170,000 men.  Jocelyn Samuels and Kristen Galles, In Defense of Title IX: Why Current Policies \nAre Required to Ensure Equality of Opportunity, 14 Marq. Sports L. Rev. 11, 18-19 (2003).   \n43.  In 1970, U.S. House Representative Edith Green led seven days of hearings docu-\nmenting the problem of “discrimination against women” in education.  See Hearings Before the \nSpecial Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Education and Labor House of Repre-\nsentatives on Section 805 of H.R. 16098, 91st Cong. 1-2 (1970) (statement of Rep. Green).   \n44.  Two years later, Congress enacted the statute now called “Title IX,” prohibiting \ndiscrimination based on “sex” in education programs and activities receiving federal financial \n13 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 14 of 83 - Page ID#: 14\n \nassistance.  See Equal Opportunity in Education Act, Pub. L. No. 92-318, tit. IX, 86 Stat. 373 \n(1972) (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.).   \n45.  The bill’s Senate sponsor, Birch Bayh of Indiana, called Title IX “[t]he only anti-\ndote” to “the continuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination against women . . . in[] all \nfacets of education.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5,803.  Referencing extensive evidence, including the 1970 \nhearings, Senator Bayh said Title IX would help “provide [American] women … an equal chance \nto attend the schools of their choice[ and] to develop the skills they want.”  Id. at 5,804-06, 5,808.   \n46.  The House Report recommending passage of the bill and statements from the bill’s \nHouse sponsors sounded similar themes.  H.R. Rep. No. 92-554, at 51-52 (1971); 117 Cong. Rec. \n39,252 (1971) (statement of Rep. Patsy Mink). \n47.  Although Title IX’s text did not expressly reference athletics, Congress quickly \namended the statute to add the “Javits Amendment.”  Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. \nNo. 93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 484, 612 (1974).  That provision directed the Department of Educa-\ntion’s predecessor agency, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (“HEW”), to pro-\npose regulations “implementing [Title IX’s] provisions[,] . . . includ[ing,] with respect to intercol-\nlegiate athletic activities[,] reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.”  Id.   \n48.  The Javits Amendment supplemented the statute’s general authorization of federal \nagencies administering federal financial assistance to education programs and activities to “effec-\ntuate” Title IX’s provisions via “rules, regulations, or orders.”  20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n49.  Congress also authorized federal agencies to enforce Title IX’s prohibition by ter-\nminating a non-compliant recipient’s Title IX assistance.

Fifty years after Title IX’s enactment, women outnumber men in higher education, \nearning more than fifty percent of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.3  \n51.  These gains have improved the opportunities available to tens of millions of Amer-\nican women, including the thirty million female Americans who are currently school aged.4    \n52.  Female athletics participation has also increased exponentially.  Since its enactment \nin 1972, Title IX has led to an explosion in the participation of girls and women in sports.  In 2021, \n3.4 million girls played high school sports, and 219,000 women played NCAA sports.5  These \nrecent figures reflect a broader trend.  NCAA statistics show that since 1982 (when the NCAA \nbegan separating male and female participation rates), female participation rates in athletics have \nrisen from 43% of the male participation rate (74,329 to 169,800) to 78% (219,177 to 278,988) in \n2021—almost doubling.6  The successes of women on America’s playing fields correlate directly \nto greater opportunities for women in America’s board rooms.  See Adams, 57 F.4th at 820-21 \n(Lagoa, J., concurring) (“[R]esearch shows stunningly that 94[ ] percent of women C-Suite exec-\nutives today played sport[s].” (citation omitted)).

Since Title IX’s enactment, science has confirmed what common sense suggested \nin the 1970s: “[W]ere play and competition not separated by sex, the great bulk of the females \nwould quickly be eliminated from participation and denied any meaningful opportunity for athletic \ninvolvement.”  Cape v. TSSAA, 563 F.2d 793, 795 (6th Cir. 1977).  Because of the physiological \ndifferences between males and females, men and even boys outperform the best female athletes in \nthe world.  See Comment by the Independent Women’s Law Center, ED-2022-OCR-0143-155361, \nat 3 (May 15, 2023), attached as Exhibit E-6 [hereinafter IWLC Comment] (citing research).  The \nsame is true across all levels of sports.  See Tennessee Athletics Comment at 14-15.   \n54.  Differences in “cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, \nspeed/agility and power,” among others, reduce female competitiveness as early as age six—a \ndisadvantage that the onset of male puberty only exaggerates.  Id. at 14 (quoting United Kingdom \nSports Councils, Int’l Res. Literature Rev. at 3 (Sept. 2021), https://perma.cc/H3TJ-KEDE).  The \nperformance advantage of men over women is typically 10-50% depending on the sport.7  The \nreason for male athletic advantage is biology.  Males have 45% higher lean-body mass, 33% higher \nlower-body muscle mass, 40% higher upper-body muscle mass, 54% higher knee extension \nstrength, and 30% higher maximum cardiac output.8  The result is that, by early teens, many ado-\nlescent males surpass elite (i.e., Olympic and world championship level) female performance in \nnearly all sports.9  See Indiana Athletics Comment at 10.  And studies show that suppressing \n \n7 Emma N. Hilton & Tommy R.

See \nTennessee Athletics Comment at 15; see also IWLC Comment at 5-6 (citing similar research).10   \n55.  Yet, in recent years, high school and collegiate sporting bodies have adopted poli-\ncies that threaten to undermine the gains women have achieved in sports and beyond by allowing \nmen who identify as women to participate in women’s athletic competitions.   \n56.  The NCAA, for example, has allowed males with suppressed testosterone levels to \ncompete on women’s teams.11  Some high school athletic associations have even adopted policies \nallowing males to compete on girls’ or women’s teams without undergoing surgery or hormone \ntherapy.12 \n57.  Although these policies are relatively new, they have already proved detrimental to \nfemale opportunity and physical safety.  Men identifying as women have taken athletic titles—and \nopportunities to compete—from women.  See Tennessee Athletics Comment at 15; see also Cyd \nZeigler, These 23 trans women have won national or international competitions or championships, \nOutsports (Mar. 1, 2022), https://perma.cc/X7UT-9FDQ.  And as common sense would dictate \ngiven their greater strength and speed, allowing males to compete in women’s sports has led to \nserious physical injuries among female athletes.

Recognizing these dangers and the “science around physical performance and male \nadvantage,” a number of international sporting bodies have barred male athletes or athletes who \nhave gone through male puberty from participating in female competitions.13  See Comment by \nAlliance Defending Freedom, ED-2022-OCR-0143-150698, at 24 (May 15, 2023), attached as \nExhibit E-5 [hereinafter ADF Athletics Comment]. \n59.  At least twenty-five States have likewise adopted restrictions that preclude males’ \nparticipation in female athletics, even when a male athlete identifies as a woman.14   \n60.  Allowing males to play on female teams will moreover reduce women’s educa-\ntional access.  Athletic scholarships help students pursue educational opportunities.  If scholarships \navailable to students joining a female team are given to males (as reportedly attempted by one \nDivision I school15), that means fewer athletic—and educational—opportunities for women. \nC.  Title IX’s Clear Scope \n61.  Many scholars attribute the dramatic improvement in women’s educational oppor-\ntunities since 1972, at least in part, to Title IX’s simple pronouncement: “No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681 (emphasis added); see, e.g., Samuels & Galles, supra, at 33-34; see \n \n13 Katie Falkingham, World Athletics bans transgender women from competing in female \nworld ranking events, BBC (Mar. 23, 2023), https://perma.cc/JG9S-V5AR; see also World Cy-\ncling’s governing body bans female transgender athletes from women’s events, Associated Press \n(July 14, 2023), https://perma.cc/Q9MN-NVZN. \n14 Movement Advancement Project, LGBTQ Youth: Bans on Transgender Youth Partici-\npation in Sports (2024), https://perma.cc/P7E7-K55H. \n15 Taylor Penley, NCAA volleyball player refuses to stay silent as trans athletes put \nwomen’s opportunities ‘at risk’, FoxBusiness (Dec. 19, 2023), https://perma.cc/UE88-F9JE.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 19 of 83 - Page ID#: 19\n \nalso Elizabeth Kaufer Busch & William E. Thro, Restoring Title IX’s Constitutional Integrity, 33 \nMarq. Sports L. Rev. 507, 507-08 & n.1 (2022).                                                           \n62.  The plain meaning of this provision belies that it applies to terms like “gender iden-\ntity” that are distinct from “sex.”  As the en banc Eleventh Circuit recognized, “[r]eputable dic-\ntionary definitions of ‘sex’ from the time of Title IX’s enactment [in 1972] show that when Con-\ngress prohibited discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education, it meant biological sex, i.e., \ndiscrimination between males and females.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 815.   \n63.  Context confirms this reading.  Title IX expressly states that it does not “prohibit \nany educational institution … from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes,” \ni.e., “for” males and females.  20 U.S.C. § 1686 (emphasis added).  Senator Bayh explained that \nsuch “differential treatment by sex” was permissible “where personal privacy must be preserved.”  \n118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (statement of Sen. Bayh).  And it makes sense that Title IX would not treat \nthe provision of sex-separate facilities as discriminatory.  Sex-based classifications like this one, \nunlike race-based classifications, are not inherently invidious because they are rooted in “endur-\ning’ differences between men and women.”  L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 484 \n(6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533).  In other words, they do not treat “similarly \nsituated” individuals unequally.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 657. \n64.  Moreover, § 1686’s safe-harbor for “separate” male and female facilities “would \nbe rendered meaningless” if “sex” did not refer to a male-female binary based on physiological \ndifferences.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 813.  Interpreting sex discrimination to encompass “gender iden-\ntity” discrimination, for example, “would result in situations where an entity would be prohibited \nfrom installing or enforcing the otherwise permissible sex-based carve-outs when the carve-outs \ncome into conflict with a transgender person’s gender identity.”  Id. at 814.  That would grant \n19 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 20 of 83 - Page ID#: 20\n \ntransgender persons “dual protection under Title IX based on both sex and gender identity,” im-\npermissibly giving “‘different meanings to the same [statutory] phrase.’”  Id. (quoting Cochise \nConsultancy, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Hunt, 139 S. Ct. 1507, 1512 (2019)).    \n65.  Beyond § 1686, Title IX consistently treats sex as a binary, using phrases such as \n“one sex,” “the other sex,” and “both sexes.”  For example, the statute excepts from its coverage a \npublic undergraduate institution with a historic “policy of admitting only students of one sex,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(5) (emphasis added); certain organizations whose memberships have “tradition-\nally been limited to persons of one sex,” id. § 1681(a)(6) (emphasis added); “father-son or mother-\ndaughter activities,” so long as similar opportunities provided for “one sex” are provided for “the \nother sex,” id. § 1681(a)(8) (emphasis added); and scholarships associated with participation in a \nbeauty pageant “limited to individuals of one sex only,” id. § 1681(a)(9) (emphasis added).  Title \nIX also clarifies that it does not require “preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one \nsex.”  Id. § 1681(b). \n66.  Many of Title IX’s exclusions from coverage preserve male-only or female-only \nspaces.  The statute does not apply, for example, to the membership practices of college fraternities \nand sororities or to those of sex-segregated voluntary service organizations like the Girl Scouts \nand Camp Fire Girls.  Id. § 1681(a)(6).  Nor does it apply to the programs or activities of Boys and \nGirls State and Boys and Girls Nation.  Id. § 1681(a)(7). \n67.  This treatment of “sex” as a male-female binary reflects Title IX’s linguistic con-\ntext.  “The phrase ‘gender identity’ did not exist” in 1972 “outside of some esoteric psychological \npublications.”  Ryan T. Anderson & Melody Wood, Gender Identity Policies in Schools: What \nCongress, the Courts, and the Trump Administration Should Do, at 9, The Heritage Found. (2017), \nhttps://perma.cc/VG5N-ZAYE.  And the word “gender” had itself “been coined only recently in \n20 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 21 of 83 - Page ID#: 21\n \ncontradistinction to sex.”  Id.  Indeed, “psychiatric literature” at the time “conflated sexual orien-\ntation with gender identity.”  Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 3 F.4th 1299, 1336 (11th Cir. \n2021) (Pryor, C.J., dissenting) (citing Jack Drescher, Transsexualism, Gender Identity Disorder \nand the DSM, 14 J. Gay & Lesbian Mental Health 109, 111 (2010)), rev’d on reh’g on banc, 57 \nF.4th 791.   \n68.  These textual, structural, and linguistic clues accord with the evidence that Con-\ngress enacted Title IX with a sex-specific purpose: to remedy discrimination against women in \nAmerican education by promoting equal educational opportunities for them going forward.   \nII.  Decades of Administrative Interpretations Confirm Title IX’s Limited Application to \nSex Discrimination.   \n69.  Soon after Title IX’s enactment, in 1975, HEW finalized regulations “effectuat[ing] \nthe provisions of [Title IX]” and, per then-applicable statutory procedures, submitted them to Con-\ngress for review.  20 U.S.C. § 1682; N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 531 (1982); see \nalso 45 C.F.R. pt. 86 (1975) (now codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106).  These provisions addressed the \neffect of Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination based on “sex” in admissions, education programs \nand activities, athletics, and employment.  See generally 34 C.F.R. pt. 106. \n70.  Both houses of Congress held extensive hearings reviewing the regulations’ con-\nsistency with Title IX.  See Samuels & Galles, supra, at 20 & n.48.  No congressional resolution \ndisapproving them passed, and HEW’s regulations went into effect on July 21, 1975.16  See Bell, \n \n16 Congress later created the Department of Education and transferred all HEW’s functions \nrelating to educational programs to the Secretary of Education.  20 U.S.C. §§ 3411, 3441(a)(3).  \nHEW’s determinations, rules, and regulations remain effective.  And the relevant provisions of the \nTitle IX regulations discussed below have not been revised since 1975.   \n21 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 22 of 83 - Page ID#: 22\n \n456 U.S. at 532-33; see also id. at 534 (finding Congress’s failure to disapprove the regulations \n“lends weight” to the notion that they are “valid and consistent with the legislative intent”). \n71.  Like Title IX, the 1975 regulations, which were recodified without substantive \nchange in 34 C.F.R. part 106, treat sex as a binary, referring multiple times to “one sex,” especially \nversus “the other sex,” using the phrase “both sexes,” and referencing “boys and girls” and “male \nand  female  teams.”    See,  e.g.,  34  C.F.R.  §§  106.33,  106.34(a)(3),  106.36(c),  106.37(a)(3), \n106.41(c), 106.51(a)(4), 106.58(a), 106.60(b), 106.61; see also 34 C.F.R. pt. 86 (1975).   \n72.  Consistent with the statutory structure, the regulations also preserve certain sex-\nsegregated spaces, authorizing a recipient, for example, to “provide separate housing on the basis \nof sex,” id. § 106.32; “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of \nsex,” id. § 106.33; conduct “separate sessions for boys and girls” of sexual-education classes in \nelementary and secondary schools, id. § 106.34(a)(3); and “make requirements based on vocal \nrange or quality which may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex,” id. \n§ 106.34(a)(4).  Like the statutory carveout for sex-separate facilities, these regulatory provisions \nwould make no sense if “sex” refers to something other than physiological differences between \nmales and females.  \n73.  The original rules governing athletics accord with Title IX’s general prohibition on \ndiscrimination and with its approval of sex separation in certain cases.  They forbid discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” in “interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics” but allow a \nrecipient to sponsor “separate teams for members of each sex” when team selection is “based upon \ncompetitive skill” or the sport is a “contact sport.”  Id. § 106.41(a)-(b).  Underlining that sex dif-\nferentiation does not equal sex discrimination under Title IX, the athletics rules require “equal \nathletic  opportunity  for  members  of  both  sexes,”  including  in  the  distribution  of  athletic \n22 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 23 of 83 - Page ID#: 23\n \nscholarships and the provision of facilities, equipment, and services, but provide that “aggregate \nexpenditures for members of each sex” and “expenditures for male and female teams” need not \nnecessarily be equal to comply with Title IX.  Id. § 106.41(c); see also id. § 106.37(c).    \n74.  Consistent, too, with Title IX’s purpose, the regulations also require covered insti-\ntutions that admitted “only students of one sex” before 1965 to “overcome the effects of past ex-\nclusion of students on the basis of sex” by developing and implementing a plan to “encourage \nindividuals of the previously excluded sex to apply for admission.”  45 C.F.R. §§ 86.16, 86.17(d) \n(emphasis added).  In many cases, “the previously excluded sex” means women.  See Lew, supra, \nat 855-56 & n.40 (noting the transition from male-only education to coeducation in private univer-\nsities took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s). \n75.  Judicial decisions in the first decades after the statute’s passage reflect a similar \nunderstanding that Congress enacted Title IX to combat “discrimination against women in the field \nof education.”  Bell, 456 U.S. at 523-24 (emphasis added); see also Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 \nU.S. 677, 694 & n.16, 704 n.36 (1979) (recognizing that a female applicant to medical school was \n“clearly a member of that class for whose special benefit [Title IX] was enacted”).   Such decisions \ndescribe the law and its regulations as a deliberate check on “male dominance” in academic set-\ntings.  Yellow Springs Exempted Vill. Sch. Dist. v. Ohio High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 647 F.2d 651, \n658 (6th Cir. 1981); accord Ridgeway v. Mont. High Sch. Ass’n, 858 F.2d 579, 581 (9th Cir. 1988). \n76.  In the decades that followed, the Department of Education consistently interpreted \n“sex” as a binary classification—male, female—consistent with the statutory text, structure, and \npurpose and with the statute’s implementing regulations.   \n77.  For example, in adopting 1997 guidance clarifying that Title IX covers same-sex \nsexual harassment, the Department stated, “both male and female students are protected from \n23 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 24 of 83 - Page ID#: 24\n \nsexual harassment . . . even if the harasser and the person being harassed are members of the same \nsex.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ.

The guidance did not use the term “gender identity,” \nand it stated that “Title IX does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,” \npresumably because the Department then understood “sex” to refer to the status of being male or \nfemale, not that of being heterosexual or homosexual.  Id.; see also id. at 12,036. \nIII.  The Obama Education Department Unveils a New 2014 Reading of Title IX that \nTurns on Students’ Gender Identity, Not Sex.  \n78.  The Department’s longstanding and consistent view of Title IX suddenly shifted in \nthe second half of President Obama’s tenure.   \n79.  Previously, in a “Dear Colleague Letter” on bullying, the Obama Department of \nEducation had tracked the historic understanding of Title IX as limited to sex-based discrimination. \nThat  letter  acknowledged  that  claims  of  sex  discrimination  by  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and \ntransgender students based on their “LGBT status” must overlap with “sexual harassment or gen-\nder-based harassment.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague Letter on Bullying, \nat 8 (Oct. 26, 2010) (marked “not for reliance”), https://perma.cc/3AGM-SB8P. \n80.  Yet, a few years later, the Department performed an about-face, asserting that “Title \nIX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination” based solely on “gender \nidentity.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual \nViolence, at 5 (Apr. 29, 2014) (rescinded in 2017), https://perma.cc/Y7BD-XHFU; see also G.G. \nex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 722 (4th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted) \n24 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 25 of 83 - Page ID#: 25\n \n(deferring to but acknowledging the “novelty” of this position).  The Department offered no ex-\nplanation or justification for its reversal.  \n81.  A subsequent “Dear Colleague” letter asserting that Title IX “encompasses discrim-\nination based on a student’s gender identity, including discrimination based on a student’s \ntransgender status,” compounded this deficiency.  U.S. Dep’t of Just. & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. \nfor Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender Students, at 1 (May 13, 2016) \n(rescinded in 2017), https://perma.cc/G5VG-ZNV9 [hereinafter 2016 Dear Colleague Letter]; see \nalso U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Letter to Emily T. Prince, Esq., at 1-2 (Jan. 7, 2015) \n(rescinded in 2017), https://perma.cc/4ZRV-8LQ7 (previewing this position).  The guidance failed \nto square the Department’s new reading with its previous interpretation of “sex.”  Nor did it offer \nany legal analysis supporting the new interpretation.  Instead, it asserted that a recipient would \ndiscriminate “on the basis of sex” if it failed to “treat students consistent with their gender iden-\ntity,” even if a student’s gender identity conflicted with records of his or her sex.  2016 Dear \nColleague Letter at 3.   \n82.  The Department suggested that a recipient’s failure to compel faculty and staff to \n“use pronouns and names consistent with a transgender student’s gender identity” could violate \nthis newly interpreted Title IX.  Id.  A recipient would also engage in sex discrimination under the \nDepartment’s reading if it failed to permit students to access restrooms, locker rooms, shower \nfacilities, and housing, or if the recipient failed to allow students to participate in activities, includ-\ning sports, based on their gender identity alone.  Id. at 3-4.  \n83.  A federal court in Texas swiftly enjoined the enforcement of the Dear Colleague \nletter and related guidance nationwide.  See Texas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 816 n.4, \n836 (N.D. Tex. 2016), clarified by, No. 7:16-cv-00054-O, 2016 WL 7852331 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 18, \n25 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 26 of 83 - Page ID#: 26\n \n2016).  The court held that plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits in arguing (a) that the \nDepartment and other defendants violated the APA’s notice and comment requirements by adopt-\ning “legislative and substantive” rules in the guise of guidance, and (b) that the ordinary public \nmeaning of “sex” as used in Title IX unambiguously precluded construing that term to mean “gen-\nder identity.”  Id. at 827-34.  The injunction was dissolved when plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed \ntheir suit after the guidance was withdrawn.  See Pls.’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, Texas v. \nUnited States, No. 7:16-cv-00054-O (N.D. Tex. Mar. 3, 2017), ECF No. 128. \nIV.  The Trump Education Department Returns to Reading Title IX to Cover Only Sex. \nA.  Rescission of the Dear Colleague Letter and 2020 Title IX Rule \n84.  In February 2017, President Trump’s administration withdrew and rescinded the \nObama Department’s gender-identity guidance.  U.S. Dep’t of Just. & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. \nfor  Civ.  Rts.,  Dear  Colleague  Letter  on  Gender  Identity  Guidance  (Feb.  22,  2017), \nhttps://perma.cc/H6E3-YBEZ.  The Departments of Education and Justice explained that the with-\ndrawn documents (a) did not contain “extensive legal analysis,” (b) did not explain the consistency \nof their position with Title IX’s “express language,” and (c) did not “undergo any formal public \nprocess.”  Id. at 1.  The Departments also emphasized the “primary role of the States and local \nschool districts in establishing educational policy.”  Id.  And the administration made clear that \nthe withdrawal of the previous guidance merely returned the state of the law to the pre-2014 un-\nderstanding of Title IX’s scope.  See id. at 2. \n85.  In 2020, the Department promulgated further amendments to its Title IX regula-\ntions to better align the Department’s enforcement practices with the statutory text and case law in \nthe area of sexual harassment.  See Dep’t of Educ., Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Edu-\ncation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May \n26 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 27 of 83 - Page ID#: 27\n \n19, 2020).  Relevant here, the Department defined “sexual harassment” as “conduct that is so se-\nvere, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to edu-\ncation.”  Id. at 30,036.  By requiring that harassment satisfy all three of those characteristics, the \nDepartment stated its definition would capture “serious situations” of conduct or speech while \naccounting for the fact that “younger students are still learning social skills and older students \nbenefit from robust exchange of ideas, opinions, and beliefs.”  Id. at 30,143.  \n86.  In justifying its definition of harassment, the Department explained that it tracked \n“verbatim,” id. at 30,036, the Supreme Court’s definition in Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. v. Monroe \nCounty Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999).  Though Davis arose in the context of determin-\ning schools’ Title IX liability in private damages actions for student-on-student harassment, the \nDepartment noted that “[n]othing in . . . Davis purports to restrict” its framework “only to private \nlawsuits for money damages.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 30,033.  The Department, moreover, reasoned that \nthe Davis “framework” reflected Title IX’s application to “discrimination” (i) “by the school,” 85 \nFed. Reg. at 30,200, 30,033, that (ii) is severe enough that it “effectively denies a person’s equal \naccess” to an educational program or activity, id. at 30,154.  The Department also explained that \na “narrowly tailored” definition of hostile-environment harassment was necessary to apply Title \nIX “in a manner consistent with respect for First Amendment rights, and principles of free speech \nand academic freedom, in education programs and activities.”  Id. at 30,142.   \n87.  The 2020 Rule did not amend other regulations implementing Title IX’s non-dis-\ncrimination directive, like those permitting sex-separated housing and intimate facilities.  Id. at \n30,178 (discussing 34 C.F.R. 106.32-34).  But it noted that both “Title IX and its implementing \nregulations  include  provisions  that  presuppose  sex  as  a  binary  classification,”  and  that  the \n27 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 28 of 83 - Page ID#: 28\n \nDepartment has “acknowledged physiological differences based on biological sex” in regulating \nphysical education under Title IX.  Id.   \nB.  Bostock \n88.   One month after the Department issued the 2020 Rule, the U.S. Supreme Court \nissued its decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, holding that Title VII’s prohibition \non sex discrimination bars an employer from firing an employee based on sexual orientation or \ntransgender status.  Id. at 651-52.  The Court’s decision rested on two key holdings.   \n89.  First, the Court held that Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination “because of” sex \nincorporates a but-for causation standard, meaning that “[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one \nbut-for cause of [a challenged employment decision],” Title VII’s coverage is triggered.  Id. at \n656, 659; see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).   \n90.  Second, the Court held that, an employee’s “sex plays an unmistakable and imper-\nmissible role in [a] discharge decision” based on homosexual or transgender status.  590 U.S. at \n660.  The Court reasoned that an employer who fires a male employee “for no reason other than \nthe fact he is attracted to men . . . discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his \nfemale colleague”; likewise, an employer who fires a male transgender person who now identities \nas a female “intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it \ntolerates in an employee identified as female at birth.”  Id.  Because Title VII forbids any consid-\neration of sex in firing an employee, the Court reasoned that Title VII prohibits an employer from \nfiring an employee based on his or her homosexuality or transgender status.  Id. at 660-62.  \n91.  Importantly, the Court assumed that “sex” referred “only to biological distinctions \nbetween male and female” at the time of Title VII’s enactment in 1964.  Id. at 655. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 29 of 83 - Page ID#: 29\n \n92.  The Court also expressly declined to “prejudge” whether its decision in Bostock \nwould “sweep beyond Title VII” to laws such as Title IX.  Id. at 681.   \n93.  It similarly declined to consider whether employer conduct other than firing an em-\nployee for being homosexual or transgender—for example, enforcing “sex-segregated bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, and dress codes”—would constitute actionable discrimination under Title VII.  Id.  \n94.  And the Court did not consider, much less decide, what Title IX’s statutory phrase \n“on the basis of sex” means or whether and how Title IX’s explicit provision for sex-separated \nliving facilities and other spaces inform the meaning of sex discrimination under Title IX. \nC.  Post-Bostock Guidance \n95.  In the wake of the Bostock decision, some courts read Bostock broadly—disregard-\ning the decision’s explicit limitations of its scope.  Such courts concluded that Bostock’s reasoning \napplied to Title IX, meaning that “Title IX, like Title VII, prohibits discrimination against a person \nbecause he is transgender, because this constitutes discrimination based on sex.”  Adams ex rel. \nKasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 968 F.3d 1286, 1305 (11th Cir. 2020), rev’d on reh’g en \nbanc, 47 F.4th 791.   \n96.  The Department of Education’s Office of the General Counsel sharply disagreed.  \nIn a January 2021 memorandum discussing the decision’s implications for enforcement of Title \nIX, the General Counsel underlined Bostock’s narrow scope.  Reed D. Rubinstein, Memorandum \nFor Kimberly M. Richey, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office for Civil Rights, re: Bostock v. \nClayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Jan. 8, 2021), https://perma.cc/Q9YC-Q4Y2.  The memo-\nrandum concluded that Bostock does not control the meaning of “sex” under Title IX and that the \n“Department’s longstanding construction of the term ‘sex’ in Title IX [is] biological sex, male or \nfemale.”  Id. at 1.  It also reasoned that construing “sex” to mean “biological sex” is “the only \n29 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 30 of 83 - Page ID#: 30\n \nconstruction consistent with the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ at the time of Title IX’s enact-\nment,” the statutory and regulatory text and structure—including § 1686’s express carve-out for \nsex-separate facilities—and Department practice.  Id. at 1-4.  Finally, the memorandum determined \nthat giving “sex” its ordinary meaning not only permits but requires a Title IX recipient providing \n“separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities” or “separate athletic teams” to regulate entry \nbased on sex.  Id. at 7, 9. \n97.  Several courts have likewise held that “Title VII differs from Title IX in important \nrespects” and that “principles announced in the Title VII context [do not] automatically apply in \nthe Title IX context.”  Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021) (noting that, \n“under Title IX, universities must consider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.37(c), and may take it into account in ‘maintaining separate living facilities for the different \nsexes.’ 20 U.S.C. § 1686”); see also Adams, 57 F.4th at 811 (explaining that “Title IX, unlike Title \nVII, includes express statutory and regulatory carve-outs for differentiating between the sexes \nwhen it comes to separate living and bathroom facilities, among others”); A.C. ex rel. M.C. v. \nMetro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760, 769 (7th Cir. 2023) (finding Bostock provided \n“useful guidance” but noting that “the particular application of sex discrimination it addressed was \ndifferent”), cert. denied sub nom., Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville v. A.C., 144 S. Ct. 683 (2024).  \nBut see Grabowski v. Ariz. Bd. of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116-18 (9th Cir. 2023) (construing \nTitle IX consistently with Title VII and thus applying Bostock to hold that Title IX covers discrim-\nination based on “perceived sexual orientation”); Grimm, 972 F.3d at 616-17 (similar as to a \ntransgender student). \n30 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 31 of 83 - Page ID#: 31\n \nV.  The Biden Administration Reverses Course Again by Proposing the Challenged Gen-\nder-Identity Mandate. \nA.  Initial Guidance \n98.  Upon assuming office, President Biden and his administration surged in the oppo-\nsite direction.  As one of his first official acts as president, President Biden declared that Bostock’s \nanalysis changed the meaning of all federal law governing sex discrimination: “Under Bostock’s \nreasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), . . . , along with their respective implementing \nregulations—prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long \nas the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7,023, 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021). \n99.  President Biden directed each federal agency to review all existing regulations and \nother agency actions for consistency with that position and develop a plan to “ensure that [the \nagency was] fully implementing the policy” set forth in the Executive Order.  Id. at 7,024. \n100.  Accordingly, in June 2021, the Department of Education published guidance re-\ngarding “Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Dis-\ncrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty.”  86 Fed. Reg. 32,637-01 (June 22, 2021) [hereinafter Interpretation].  Relying heavily on \nBostock’s analysis of Title VII, the Department “interpret[ed] Title IX’s prohibition on discrimi-\nnation ‘on the basis of sex’ to encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and \ngender identity.”  Id. at 32,637.   \n101.  In relevant part, the Department concluded that the phrase “on the basis of sex” in \nTitle IX has the same meaning as the phrase “because of . . . sex” in Title VII.  Id. at 32,638-39.  \n31 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 32 of 83 - Page ID#: 32\n \nIt cited two federal appellate court decisions—one of which has since been reversed—“recog-\nniz[ing] that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based on \nsexual orientation and gender identity.”  Id. at 32,639 (collecting cases).  It ignored other federal \nappellate decisions distinguishing Title VII and Title IX.  See, e.g., Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 510 \nn.4.  And the Department concluded that its interpretation “is most consistent with the purpose of \nTitle IX”—“ensur[ing] equal opportunity and . . . protect[ing] individuals from the harms of sex \ndiscrimination.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 32,639. \n102.  The Department followed this new guidance with a “Dear Educator” letter and fact \nsheet, vowing that the Office of Civil Rights “w[ould] fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimi-\nnation based on sexual orientation and gender identity in education programs and activities that \nreceive Federal financial assistance from the Department.”  Suzanne B. Goldberg, Dear Educator \nletter  on  Confronting  Anti-LGBTQI+  Harassment  in  Schools,  at  2  (June  23,  2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/A759-WKR9. \n103.  The fact sheet purported to provide examples of discriminatory action under Title \nIX, as interpreted through the Bostock lens, but it described scenarios that Bostock explicitly de-\nclined to address, such as a school that does not allow a transgender student to use the restroom or \nparticipate in sports associated with the student’s gender identity.  Id.; cf. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681. \n104.  Like the Obama Administration guidance, the Biden guidance failed to withstand a \npreliminary challenge in federal court.  In Tennessee v. U.S. Department of Education, the court \npreliminarily enjoined the Department and its co-defendants from implementing the Interpretation, \nDear Educator letter, and fact sheet against twenty States, including the State of Tennessee.  615 \nF. Supp. 3d 807, 842 (E.D. Tenn. 2022).  In relevant part, the court held that the Biden Department, \n32 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 33 of 83 - Page ID#: 33\n \nlike the Obama Department before it, had likely proceeded illegally by “creat[ing] new rights and \nobligations” without complying with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  Id. at 838.   \n105.  In support, the court reasoned that the new guidance “plausibly ‘adopt[s] a new \nposition inconsistent with . . . [the Department’s] existing regulations” for two reasons.  Id. at 839.  \nFirst, “Title IX does allow for sex-separation in certain circumstances,” but “the Department’s \nguidance, specifically the Fact Sheet, appears to suggest such conduct will be investigated as un-\nlawful discrimination.”  Id.  Second, the guidance “creates rights for students and obligations for \nregulated entities not to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity that appear \nnowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its implementing regulations.”  Id.  \n106.  The court emphasized that “Bostock d[id] not require Defendants’ interpretations \nof Title . . . IX.”  Id. at 833.  Rather, Defendants “fail[ed] to cabin themselves to Bostock’s hold-\ning,” “advanc[ing] new interpretations of [Title IX] and impos[ing] new legal obligations.”  Id. \n107.  The Eastern District’s injunction remains in effect pending appeal.  See Tennessee \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 22-5807 (6th Cir.) (argued Apr. 26, 2023). \nB.  The Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule \n1.  The Department’s Proposal \n108.  In July 2022, the Biden Department proposed amendments to its Title IX regula-\ntions adopting the interpretation of Title IX advanced in its previous guidance documents (the \n“Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule”).  See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking re: Nondiscrimi-\nnation on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial As-\nsistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (proposed July 12, 2022) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106). \n109.  In relevant part, the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule redefined sex discrim-\nination  under  Title  IX  to  “include[]  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  stereotypes,  sex \n33 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 34 of 83 - Page ID#: 34\n \ncharacteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  Id. at \n41,571 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10).  \n110.  The Department made clear that this definition would apply to “any academic, ex-\ntracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a \nrecipient that receives Federal financial assistance.”  Id. (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)). \n111.  The Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule provided that, even when Title IX oth-\nerwise authorizes “different treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry \nout such different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex by \nsubjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, unless otherwise permitted by Title IX or this \npart.”  Id. (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  Applying this standard, the Department \nwent on to clarify that “subject[ing] a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex” \nwould include “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a practice that prevents a person from partici-\npating in an education program or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity.”  Id.; see \nalso id. at 41,534-35. \n112.  Moreover, the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule required a recipient to “take \nprompt and effective action to end any sex discrimination that has occurred in its education pro-\ngram or activity, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.”  Id. at 41,572 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.41(a)).  \n113.  The Department’s new definition of sex discrimination also affected the revised \ndefinition of harassment, which would include “all forms of sex-based harassment, as opposed to \nonly sexual harassment,” including harassment based on gender identity.  Id. at 41,410. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 35 of 83 - Page ID#: 35\n \n114.  The Department also proposed to “make clear” that its Title IX regulations, includ-\ning the Proposed Facilities-and-Program Rule, “would preempt” “any State or local law” conflict-\ning with them.  Id. at 41,404; see also id. at 41,569 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)). \n115.  In short, the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule rewrote Title IX to prohibit sex \ndifferentiation that the statute explicitly permits. \n116.  Notably, the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule declined to address the appli-\ncation of its redefinition of sex discrimination to athletics.  The Department cited “a longstanding \ncongressional view that athletics presents unique considerations,” and it claimed that Congress \nconferred “special authority” on the Department to regulate athletics via the Javits Amendment.  \nId. at 41,537-38.  The Department said it planned to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking \nto address “whether and how” the Department should amend its 1975 athletics regulation, includ-\ning by considering “what criteria, if any, recipients should be permitted to use to establish students’ \neligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.”  Id.  \n2.  Public Comments \n117.  Underlining the significance of the Department’s reinterpretation of Title IX, as \nwell as the strength of opposition to it, the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule generated more \nthan 200,000 comments.17 \n118.  Among others, the State of Tennessee and nineteen co-signing States submitted a \npublic comment criticizing the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rules as unlawful and irrational.  \n \n17  Comments  on  the  Proposed  Facilities-and-Programs  Rule  are  available  at \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/ED-2021-OCR-0166-0001/comment. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 36 of 83 - Page ID#: 36\n \nSee generally Tennessee Facilities-and-Programs Comment.  The letter articulated three categories \nof concerns.     \n119.  First, the States argued the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule conflicted with \nTitle IX.  For many of the reasons discussed above, the States explained that the Department’s \ninterpretation of “sex” to mean “gender identity” contravenes Title IX’s text, structure, and pur-\npose, as well as the Department’s own regulations and historical practice.  Id. at 2-5.   \n120.  Second, the States cautioned that the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule pre-\nsented a number of constitutional issues.  For example, the proposal exceeded Congress’s legisla-\ntive authority under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Id. at 7.  And it threatened both \nto violate the First Amendment by requiring state-run public colleges to compel speech, and to \ninfringe parental rights by forcing school administrators to accommodate a child’s gender identity, \nregardless of parental preferences.  Id. at 6-7.   \n121.  Third, the States critiqued the Department’s failure to address crucial policy issues \nthat undermined the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule, as the APA requires.  More specifi-\ncally, the Department (i) had not considered the difficulties of authenticating gender identity; (ii) \ndismissed well-founded concerns regarding student and faculty safety; and (iii) failed to account \nfor the sex-based discrimination its proposal would cause.  Id. at 8-13. \n122.  Numerous organizations agreed that the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule’s \ninterpretation of “sex” defied Title IX’s plain meaning.  For example, Brigham Young University \nand the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities emphasized their commitment to “inclu-\nsive communities” and “legislative efforts to protect both LGBTQ rights and religious freedom.”  \nComment by Brigham Young University, et al., ED-2021-OCR-0166-226740, at 1 (Sept. 12, \n2022), attached as Exhibit E-1.  But they argued that the proposal “impose[d] a definition of ‘sex’” \n36 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 37 of 83 - Page ID#: 37\n \n. . . that extends beyond the plain language Congress provided in the statute” and “[could ]not be \nreconciled with the statute’s binary word choice concerning the word ‘sex.’”  Id. at 1-2. \n123.  Other organizations argued that the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule’s ex-\npansion of the meaning of “sex” surpassed Congress’s power to legislate under the Spending \nClause.  See, e.g., Comment by Alliance Defending Freedom (“The Rule is Legally Unsound and \nProcedurally Infirm”), ED-2021-OCR-0166-200280, at 9-12 (Sept. 11, 2022), attached as Exhibit \nE-2.  “Congress’ ‘intention’ to cover sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination under \nTitle IX must be ‘unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.’  It is not.”  Id. at 10 (footnote \nomitted) (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991)).  \n124.  Still others raised concerns that the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs Rule would \n“chill First Amendment protected speech” by applying “Title IX for the first time to discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.”  See, e.g., Comment by Pacific Legal Foun-\ndation, ED-2021-OCR-0166-212692, at 2, 7-12 (Sept. 12, 2022), attached as Exhibit E-3.  Espe-\ncially in combination with amendments to the regulations governing sexual harassment, this ex-\npansion would, the Pacific Legal Foundation predicted, lead to “encroachments into protected \nspeech,” such as “coaches speaking in opposition to biological males in women’s sports” or “stu-\ndents expressing sincere religious beliefs about the fixed nature of gender.”  Id. at 7.  They also \npredicted that professors and others might be “required to use a transgender person’s preferred \npronouns”—i.e., compelled to speak in violation of the First Amendment.  Id. at 7-8. \n125.  Other organizations highlighted the many ways in which the Department’s proposal \nwas arbitrary and capricious.  The Department had purported to expand the definition of “sex dis-\ncrimination” without defining “sex”; acted without evidence supporting its inclusion of some new \n“forms of sex discrimination” and not others; failed to address and clearly protect women’s sports; \n37 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 38 of 83 - Page ID#: 38\n \nand shirked its obligation to consider the safety costs of the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs \nRule, as well as the proposal’s potential to decrease female participation and opportunities.  Com-\nment by Ethics & Public Policy Center Scholars, ED-2021-OCR-0166-228237, at 4, 8-10, 23-26 \n(Sept. 12, 2022), attached as Exhibit E-4. \nC.  The Proposed Athletics Rule \n1.  The Department’s Proposal \n126.  About a year after proposing the rule challenged here, the Department proposed a \nsecond Title IX rule (the “Proposed Athletics Rule”) addressing the application of its new inter-\npretation of sex discrimination to athletics.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (proposed Apr. 13, 2023) (to \nbe codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106).  It gave interested parties just thirty days (plus two days to avoid \na weekend deadline) to submit comments.  Id. at 22,860. \n127.  Amending its regulations governing athletics for the first time since 1975, the De-\npartment proposed to add the following provision: \n(b) \n(2) If a recipient adopts or applies sex-related criteria that would limit or deny a \nstudent’s eligibility to participate on a male or female team consistent with their \ngender identity, such criteria must, for each sport, level of competition, and grade \nor education level: \n(i) Be substantially related to the achievement of an important educational objec-\ntive; and \n(ii) Minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a male or fe-\nmale team consistent with their gender identity would be limited or denied. \n \nId. at 22,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.41). \n \n128.  Explaining that its proposed standard was rooted in case law interpreting the Equal \nProtection Clause, the Department offered two examples of “important educational objective[s]” \nthat might qualify under the rule—“ensuring fairness in competition and prevention of sports-re-\nlated injury.”  Id. at 22,872.  But the Department explained that these objectives would not pass \n38 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 39 of 83 - Page ID#: 39\n \nmuster unless they were “substantially related to ensuring fairness in competition in [a] particular \nsport at the applicable level of competition and grade or educational level.”  Id. at 22,873, 22874-\n76.  And the Department cautioned that even criteria that were “substantially related” to achieving \nan “important educational objective” would violate proposed § 106.41(b)(2) if the recipient \n“c[ould] reasonably adopt or apply alternative criteria that would be a less harmful means of \nachieving the recipient’s important educational objective.”  Id. at 22,877. \n129.  Despite purporting not to “prohibit a recipient’s use of sex-related criteria alto-\ngether,” the Department admitted that “few, if any, sex-related eligibility criteria” would be able \nto surmount this high hurdle for elementary and middle school students.  Id. at 22,860, 22,875.  \nSuch criteria at the high school level would only be “more likely” to satisfy the Proposed Rule.  \nId. at 22,875. \n130.  The Department also identified certain justifications that would never qualify as \n“important educational objective[s]”: “communicating or codifying disapproval of a student or a \nstudent’s gender identity”; “excluding transgender students from sports”; “requir[ing] adherence \nto sex stereotypes”; and “administrative convenience.”  Id. at 22,872. \n131.  The Department suggested that the Proposed Athletics Rule would preempt State \nlaws in at least Indiana, West Virginia, and Idaho.  Yet the Department declined to consider any \n“federalism implications,” merely inviting States and local officials to review and comment on its \nproposal.  Id. at 22,866, 22,890. \n2.  Public Comments \n132.  Again, Tennessee, joined by sixteen other States, submitted a comment letter rais-\ning many of the same concerns the States expressed about the Proposed Facilities-and-Programs \nRule.  See generally Tennessee Athletics Comment.  The States also contended that the Proposed \n39 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 40 of 83 - Page ID#: 40\n \nAthletics rule adopted an unworkable standard for determining whether a recipient may lawfully \nexclude students from sports teams that conflict with their sex but align with their gender identity.  \nId. at 10-13.  And the States argued that the Department had ignored crucial evidence about the \nphysiological differences between the male and female sexes and failed to support its proposal \nwith the requisite federalism analysis or any quantitative data.  Id. at 14-17.  Nor had the Depart-\nment provided States with sufficient time to investigate the full costs of compliance, including \nrestructuring athletic competitions and paying higher insurance rates due to the heightened risk of \ninjury, or the costs associated with non-compliance, i.e., the potential loss of Title IX funding and \nits consequences to recipients.  Id.  \n133.  Indiana submitted a separate comment letter objecting to the Proposed Athletics \nRule.  See generally Indiana Athletics Comment.  Indiana argued that the rewriting of the Title IX \ndefinition of “sex” to include “gender identity” would dismantle the ultimate purpose behind the \nstatute and “destroy[] the progress made to protect the rights of girls and women . . . over the past \nfifty years.”  Id. at 1.  Indiana also contended that the Proposed Rule failed to consider the physi-\nological differences between men and women, id. at 10-13, circumnavigated Congressional au-\nthority, id. at 6-7, and would create obstacles to schools’ protection of safety and fairness for girls \nin athletics, id. at 7-10.   \n134.  Once again, comments poured in—more than 150,000.18  Many presented similar \nobjections to those Tennessee, Indiana, and other States raised.  Alliance Defending Freedom ar-\ngued, for example, that both the major-questions doctrine and the “federalism clear-notice canon” \n \n18  Comments  on  the  Proposed  Athletics  Rule  are  available  at  https://www.regula-\ntions.gov/docket/ED-2022-OCR-0143/comments. \n40 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 41 of 83 - Page ID#: 41\n \nindicate the Department lacked authority for the Proposed Athletics Rule.  ADF Athletics Com-\nment at 6-8. \n135.  Others argued the Proposed Athletics Rule would allow men to displace women on \nthe athletic field, emphasized the scientifically backed differences between men and women that \nmake competition between the sexes unfair, and highlighted the dangers to girls and women from \nallowing males to use women’s facilities and participate in women’s sports.  See, e.g., id. at 8-9; \nIWLC Comment at 3, 5-7; Comment by Independent Council on Women’s Sports at 2-5 & Exhib-\nits. \n136.  The Proposed Athletics Rule likely would have generated even more comments, \nexcept that the Department cut short the comment period to a mere thirty-two days.  See Proposed \nAthletics Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 22,860; cf. Proposed Facilities Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390, 41,390 \n(providing about sixty days to comment).  It did so despite recognizing that the Proposed Rule was \na “significant” regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13,563, see 88 Fed. Reg. at 22,878, \nwhich provides that a comment period “should generally be at least 60 days.”19 \n137.  Tennessee and twenty-two other States requested that the Department extend the \nabnormally short comment period.  Tennessee & Co-Signing States, Comment Deadline Extension \nRequest, ED-2022-OCR-0143-10614 (Apr. 21, 2023).  The Department declined. \nVI.  The Final Programs-and-Facilities Rule \n138.  On April 29, 2024, the Secretary published the final version of the Proposed Facil-\nities-and-Programs Rule.  See Exhibit A, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (“Final Rule”).  \n \n19 Executive Order on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, Exec. Order No. \n13,563, 76 Fed. Reg. 3,821, 3,821-22 (Jan. 18, 2011), https://perma.cc/JF52-7Z6Q. \n41 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 42 of 83 - Page ID#: 42\n \nDespite widespread opposition throughout the comment process, the Department maintained its \ninitial approach in substantially identical form.   \n139.  The Final Rule fundamentally and unlawfully alters Title IX’s regime in two ways \nrelevant here.  First, the Final Rule expands what constitutes unlawful sex discrimination by in-\ncorporating a suite of so-called “sex characteristics,” including “gender identity.”  Second, the \nFinal Rule broadly redefines the speech and conduct that constitute sex-based harassment subject \nto intervention or punishment by school administrators and private Title IX plaintiffs.   \nA.  Broadened Definition of “Sex” Discrimination. \n1.  Reading “Sex” to Include Gender-Identity Mandate. \n140.  Title IX’s core nondiscrimination mandate prevents recipients of federal educa-\ntional funding from engaging in discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (em-\nphasis added).  In the Final Rule, the Department says this provision captures “discrimination on \nthe basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,476 (quoting new 34 C.F.R. § 106.10).  Even this expan-\nsive list is “not exhaustive,” id. at 33,512, making it anyone’s guess what other gender theories \nTitle IX might now protect in the Department’s view.   \n141.  To implement this re-definition of sex-based discrimination, the Final Rule en-\nshrines a new way for schools to determine whether practices inflict discriminatory harm based on \nstudents’ gender identity.  The Department starts by instructing that schools are permitted to main-\ntain certain sex-segregated programs, activities, and facilities.  Id. at 33,814.  But the Department \nthen says that schools cannot enforce these sex-based distinctions in a way that “causes . . . more \nthan de minimis harm.”  Id. at 33,814, 33,816 (citing amended 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)).   \n42 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 43 of 83 - Page ID#: 43\n \n142.  Next, the Department determines that it automatically inflicts more than de minimis \nharm—and thus violates Title IX—to prohibit any “‘person’” from “‘participating in . . . education \nprogram[s and] activit[ies] consistent with [the person’s] gender identity,’” except as “otherwise \npermitted by Title IX or [the Title IX regulations].”  Id. at 33,816, 33,819-20 (quoting amended \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)). \n143.  While the Final Rule’s jargon is complex, the new bottom line for the nation’s \nschools is simple:  All federally funded elementary, middle, high, and postsecondary schools must \ngenerally adopt students’ gender identity and ignore their sex, or else face Title IX sanctions.   \n144.  The Final Rule’s related provisions make this gender-identity mandate broader still.  \nFor one, the Department explains that § 106.31(a)’s de minimis harm standard protects anyone \neven “attempting” to participate in a recipient school’s program or activity.  Id. at 33,816.  This \ncategory includes “students, employees, applicants for admission or employment, . . . parents of \nminor students, students from other institutions . . . , visiting lecturers, or other community mem-\nbers” invited to campus.  Id.  The Final Rule thus grants nearly anyone who sets foot on a school’s \ncampus a Title IX right to use restrooms and other private facilities designated for members of the \nopposite sex. \n145.  In addition, the Final Rule states that it inflicts “more than de minimis harm” on \nstudents to even inquire into or seek confirmation of their gender identity.  Id. at 33,819.  This \nmeans, the Final Rule continues, that a school cannot require documentary evidence of diagnosed \ngender dysphoria or another gender-based condition to permit participation in or use of a sex-\nseparate activity or facility.  Id.  It thus violates the Final Rule’s conception of Title IX to even try \nto verify the access of those using facilities like an elementary or secondary school girls’ bathroom \nor locker room.  Id. at 33,818-19.   \n43 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 44 of 83 - Page ID#: 44\n \n146.  The Final Rule acknowledges that its gender-identity mandate conflicts with sev-\neral other provisions of Title IX, which expressly allow sex-segregated facilities, programs, and \nactivities.  See id. at 33,818.  In particular, 20 U.S.C. § 1686 allows “separate living facilities for \nthe different sexes,” while 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) through (9) protect sex-based fraternity and \nsorority membership practices, programs and activities related to Boys State and Girls State, “fa-\nther-son or mother-daughter” activities, and “‘beauty’ pageants” “limited to individuals of one sex \nonly,” id. § 1681(6)-(9).  \n147.  The Department’s gender-identity mandate does not square with these provisions, \nwhich contemplate dividing facilities and programs based on sex.  Rather than pause at how read-\ning the term “sex” to cover gender identity makes a hash of other portions of Title IX’s scheme, \nthe Department says these exceptions to Title IX’s “general nondiscrimination mandate” mean \nschools can lawfully inflict more than de minimis discriminatory injury on students in the circum-\nstances covered.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,818-19. \n148.  The Final Rule’s gender-identity mandate further conflicts with Title IX’s original \nimplementing regulations, which are chock-full of sex-based distinctions.  Since the statute’s pas-\nsage, the Title IX regulations have “recognized limited contexts in which sex separation or differ-\nentiation is allowed.”  Id. at 33,814 (citing 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,534).  The 1975 regulations still in \neffect permit sex-separated “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities.”  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.33; \nsee supra ¶ 72.  Likewise, the Department’s regulations have for many decades permitted certain \nsex-separate classes and activities, including physical-education and sexual-education classes, as \nwell as “choruses of one . . . sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.34.   \n149.  The Final Rule does not address the tension its new reading creates with these \nlongstanding regulatory provisions.  To the contrary, the Department leaves the regulations in \n44 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 45 of 83 - Page ID#: 45\n \nplace and says schools can still maintain the covered sex-separated practices.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,818-19.  But the Final Rule then specifies that schools may no longer apply the regulations’ \nallowance for sex-separation against males who identify as females or females who identify as \nmales.  Id.   \n150.  The Final Rule makes no attempt to explain why allowing recipients to enforce sex-\nseparate father-son or mother-daughter activities and not sex-separate sexual-education classes or \nsex-separate choruses is logically consistent.  Nor does it address the reasonableness of prohibiting \nuniform enforcement of sex-separate “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33, but allowing enforcement of sex-separate housing policies.     \n151.  The Department’s patchwork approach thus maintains regulations purporting to al-\nlow sex-separated spaces and activities—thereby avoiding the politically unpalatable step of alto-\ngether eliminating the longstanding concept of separating the sexes in spaces like bathrooms and \nlocker rooms.  Yet the Department’s Final Rule outlaws schools from enforcing those same sex-\nseparated bounds when it comes to transgender students—thereby confirming that the Department \nreally is eliminating schools’ ability to adopt rules dividing spaces and activities based on sex.   \n2.  Discussion of Sex-Separated Athletics.   \n152.  The Department’s treatment of athletics reflects similar regulatory gymnastics.  \nPlainly, school athletics qualify as a “program or activity” subject to the face of the Final Rule’s \ngender-identity mandate.  But because of the “enduring” physical differences between men and \nwomen, L.W., 83 F.4th at 484 (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533), applying the gender-identity \nmandate to women’s sports would have a fairness-obliterating impact, cf. supra ¶¶ 53-60.  So, the \nDepartment’s Final Rule fashions a bespoke application of its gender-identity mandate to sports \nreplete with contradictory reasoning.   \n45 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 46 of 83 - Page ID#: 46\n \n153.  In the Final Rule’s words, “athletic competition raises unique considerations” that \nwarrant “impos[ing] more than de minimis harm on individual students” in certain circumstances.  \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817, 33,819.  And the Department promises to flesh this out on some future \ndate in a forthcoming rule on athletics with new “criteria” about sex-based separation.  But the \nFinal Rule does not acknowledge the way this position makes clear that schools that continue to \ncomply with the old athletic regulations will be in violation of the Department’s new interpretation \nof Title IX.     \n154.  To justify this approach to athletics, the Final Rule first points to the Javits Amend-\nment, which it characterizes as “tolerat[ing] sex separation in athletics.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816-\n17.  But the Final Rule does not quote any language from the Javits Amendment, id., nor \nacknowledge that this law applied only to “intercollegiate” sports programs—not those found in \nelementary, middle, and high schools.  88 Stat. 484, 612.  Next, the Final Rule points to the \n“longstanding athletics regulations” in support of continuing to allow enforcement of sex-separate \nathletics in at least some circumstances.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817.  The Final Rule does not explain \nwhy the Department’s “longstanding . . . regulations” should continue to support enforcement of \nsex-separated sports but not sex-separated “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” which have \nbeen permitted by regulation for just as long.  Compare 40 Fed. Reg. 24,128, 24,141 (1975) (now \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.33), with 40 Fed. Reg. at 24,142-43 (now codified at 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(b)).   \n155.  The Final Rule also does not acknowledge that the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) \nunder the Biden Administration has taken the opposite view of how Title IX applies to the issue \nof gender identity and sports.  In the words of DOJ, Title IX’s athletics “implementing regulation \ncannot override the statutory prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex.”  U.S. \n46 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 47 of 83 - Page ID#: 47\n \nStatement of Interest, B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-cv-00316, ECF No. 42 at 6-7 \n(S.D. W. Va. June 17, 2021) (quoting Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 618 (4th \nCir. 2020)).  So, as DOJ concluded: “Any interpretation of Title IX’s regulations that requires \ngender identity discrimination would violate the statute’s nondiscrimination mandate.”  Id. at 7.  \nThe Department of Education’s regulation-based discussion of Title IX and athletics does not \nacknowledge this stark disconnect.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816-19.         \n3.  Bostock-Based Justification for the Gender-Identity Mandate. \n156.  The Final Rule largely rests on Bostock to justify its final approach to sex discrim-\nination, while generally ignoring courts’ and commentators’ contrary analysis, evidence, and ob-\njections.  The Final Rule asserts that “Title IX does not use the term ‘on the basis of sex’ in a \nrestrictive way.”  Id. at 33,802.  Beyond that, the Department insists that Bostock renders it unnec-\nessary to define “sex” because any discrimination on the Final Rule’s broad bases “necessarily \ninvolves consideration of a person’s sex, even if that term is understood to mean only physiological \nor ‘biological distinctions between male and female.’”  Id. (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655).  \nThe Final Rule thus effectively abandons the argument that the word “sex” itself encompasses \nconcepts, like gender identity, that are divorced from sex entirely. \n157.  Casting Bostock as a silver bullet, the Department instead says “because of sex” in \nTitle VII and “on the basis of sex” in Title IX mean the same thing, so Bostock’s analysis of pro-\ntected discrimination controls.  Id. at 33,806-07.  Absent from the Final Rule is any meaningful \ndiscussion of the reasoning of decisions, such as Meriwether, which held that “principles an-\nnounced in the Title VII context [do not] automatically apply in the Title IX context” because \n“Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects.”  992 F.3d at 510 n.4; accord Adams, 57 \n47 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 48 of 83 - Page ID#: 48\n \nF.4th at 813-15 (noting Title IX’s “statutory context” precludes reading it to cover gender-identity \ndiscrimination).   \n158.  Nor does the Final Rule adequately address Bostock’s language, cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,807, which stressed that its holding did not “sweep beyond Title VII” to laws such as Title IX \nand did not address sex-segregated “bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes,” 590 U.S. at 681; \nsee Rubinstein Mem., supra ¶ 96, at 1 (citing same language to conclude Bostock did not require \ngender-identity mandate in prior Title IX guidance).   \n159.  Blowing past Bostock’s self-described limits, the Department claims it has the right \nto extend the Supreme Court’s reasoning to “sex separation in bathrooms [and] locker rooms” \ngoverned by Title IX.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818, 33,807-08.  That is so, the Final Rule asserts, be-\ncause such an expansion would best effectuate Title IX’s purpose of broadly prohibiting sex dis-\ncrimination—even as it displaces women from athletic podiums and sports teams across the coun-\ntry.  Id. at 33,804 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1682).   \n4.  Constitutional and Compliance Concerns.   \n160.  The Final Rule denies that the major-questions doctrine precludes its interpretation, \nreasoning that the Department has “expertise on what constitutes sex discrimination in education \nprograms or activities.”  Id. at 33,815.  The Department also disagrees that its approach is “un-\nprecedented,” yet does not dispute that this regulation is the first in Title IX’s fifty-year history to \ncodify a gender-identity mandate.  Id. (pointing to case law and recipient practice to justify its \ninterpretation); see also id. at 33,476, 33,805 (citing no regulation but the proposed rulemaking as \nnotice to recipients that Title IX covers gender-identity discrimination).  Even if the major-ques-\ntions doctrine applied, the Department insists that its “authority is especially clear.”  Id. at 33,815.  \nFor support, the Department points only to Congress’s general grant of authority to federal \n48 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 49 of 83 - Page ID#: 49\n \nagencies to “effectuate the provisions of [Title IX],” 20 U.S.C. § 1682, which the Department \nclaims its novel gender-identity position accomplishes, id. at 33,804-05, 33,815. \n161.  The Final Rule further dismisses comments that its new sex-discrimination view \npresents Spending Clause or federalism problems.  According to the Department, since the statu-\ntory text provided notice that Title IX “means that no recipient may discriminate on the basis of \nsex,” recipients received clear notice that they may not discriminate based on gender identity or \nany other basis contained in the Department’s non-exhaustive list.  Id. at 33,805.  And the Depart-\nment claims that the rulemaking has itself provided the required Spending Clause notice regard-\nless.  Id.   \n162.  The Department similarly rejects comments that its reading infringes on States’ and \nlocal governments’ traditional prerogative to regulate public education, all while accepting that \nthere are “existing State laws and policies that directly conflict with Title IX.”  Id. at 33,806.  But \nthe Final Rule declines to “highlight examples” of such conflicts without “relevant facts,” even as \nit provides several examples of Title IX’s scope elsewhere.  E.g., id. at 33,803 (explaining that it \nneed not add “gender norms,” “gender expression,” or “intersex traits” to its definition of sex dis-\ncrimination because each one is represented by another term); see id. at 33,813 (clarifying that \nrecipients have a duty to prevent menstruation-related harassment, such as “requiring a student to \nremove a garment around their waist”).   \n163.  In response to commenters’ concerns about overriding parents’ choices regarding \nsensitive matters like gender identity, the Final Rule asserts that “nothing in the final regulations \ndisturbs parental rights.”  Id. at 33,821.  The Department further states that “deference to [parental] \njudgment . . . is appropriate” when a “parent and minor student disagree about how to address sex \ndiscrimination against that student,” and that the regulations don’t prevent a recipient from \n49 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 50 of 83 - Page ID#: 50\n \n“disclosing information about a minor child to their parent who has the legal right to receive dis-\nclosures on behalf of their child.”  Id. at 33,822.   \n164.  But the Final Rule again declines to address any specific factual scenarios raised \nby commenters.  Id.  As a result, nothing in the Final Rule clears up the most pressing questions \nfor parental rights—like whether the gender-identity mandate means schools must adopt their stu-\ndents’ gender identity even over their parents’ or guardians’ objections.   \n165.  The Final Rule contains no discussion of other important issues commenters high-\nlighted.  \n166.  For instance, nowhere in the Final Rule does the Department address the difficulties \nassociated with authenticating gender identity.  See supra ¶ 121; cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809 (“The \nDepartment appreciates . . . that one person may not know another’s gender identity without in-\nquiring unless the other person volunteers the information.”).  If anything, the Final Rule exacer-\nbates this problem by allowing recipient schools to maintain certain sex-separate spaces yet deny-\ning their ability to verify a person’s basis for entering a space for the opposite sex.  Supra ¶ 145.   \n167.  The Department’s exceptions from its gender-identity mandate for living facilities \nand the statutory exceptions in 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1)-(9) confuse compliance further.  The De-\npartment doesn’t address whether a recipient may require documentation for participation in these \nactivities and programs that it may not require for toilets, locker rooms, showers, classes, and other \npurposes.  Nor does it instruct schools how to determine whether certain spaces—like toilets and \nshowers in the hall of a dorm complex—fall within “housing” facilities that can exclude by sex, \nor “bathroom” facilities that cannot.  See generally 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816-17, 33,820-21. \n168.  In addition, the Department gives short shrift to comments about the privacy con-\ncerns and safety risks the Final Rule presents.  Tennessee and other commenters cited extensive \n50 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 51 of 83 - Page ID#: 51\n \nevidence of sexual assaults and other crimes perpetrated by a boy or man who took advantage of \na bathroom’s or locker room’s privacy-enhancing features to victimize a vulnerable female.  See, \ne.g., Tennessee Facilities-and-Programs Comment at 9-11.  Rather than address this evidence head \non, the Department says it “does not agree” such evidence shows that “transgender students pose \na safety risk.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820.   \n169.  The Department then casts the real problem as “cisgender” persons’ “preferences \n[and] discomfort,” and rejects the notion that “the mere presence of a transgender person in a \nsingle-sex space compromises anyone’s legitimate privacy interest” or poses “a safety risk to cis-\ngender students.”  Id. (emphasis added).  But “courts have long recognized” that persons’ bodily \nprivacy interests are “significantly heightened when persons of the opposite biological sex are \npresent.”  Grimm, 972 F.3d at 633 (Neimeyer, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  The Department \nnonetheless conflates students’ privacy concerns—which have informed practices “universally ac-\ncepted … across societies and throughout history,” id.—with “unconstitutional discrimination,” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820.     \n170.  Moreover, as to safety, the Final Rule requires that just about “any ‘person’” on \ncampus be allowed to use sex-separate facilities consistent with his or her subjective and internal \nsense of gender identity.  See supra ¶¶ 144-45; 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816.  The Department nowhere \nexplains how a school can continue to “make and enforce rules that protect all students’ safety and \nprivacy,” yet also abide by the Final Rule’s requirement of allowing any person unfettered, unver-\nified access to facilities for the opposite sex.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820.   \n171.  The Department “declines … to require” recipients to “provide gender-neutral or \nsingle-occupancy facilities,” in part because it “would likely carry significant cost implications.”  \nId.  But the Department fails to consider that many schools have responded to gender-identity \n51 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 52 of 83 - Page ID#: 52\n \nmandates by building such facilities for students who do not wish to encounter members of the \nopposite sex in private spaces.  Nor does the Department consider cost implications from restruc-\nturing facilities to comply with the Final Rule’s requiring recipients to allow males to use female \nfacilities and vice versa. \n172.  The Department lastly dismisses evidence that allowing males to participate in ac-\ntivities previously reserved for females will harm women’s opportunities.  It states in conclusory \nfashion that extending Title IX’s protections to gender identity “in no way lessens the force of \nTitle IX’s protections against discrimination that limits educational opportunities for girls and \nwomen.”  Id. at 33,808.  But the Department does not address commenters’ evidence that males \nhave already taken championships, titles, scholarships, and opportunities to compete from girls \nand women in the athletics context—opportunities that correlate with female success in other \nfields.  See supra ¶¶ 133-35.  Nor does it recognize the possibility that males who identify as \nfemale could take other educational opportunities from women in a world that is often “zero-sum.”  \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 218-19 \n(2023) (noting “[a] benefit provided to some [college] applicants but not to others necessarily ad-\nvantages the former group at the expense of the latter”).20   \n173.  The Department also fails to consider evidence of the physical differences between \nmales and females that justify sex-separation in sports and elsewhere.  See supra ¶¶ 133, 135.  \nInstead, the Final Rule states without explanation or evidence that “physical differences” generally \n \n20 See also, e.g., Amanda Musa, Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas nominated for NCAA \nWoman of the Year Award, CNN (July 15, 2022), https://perma.cc/RXU4-Z3S4; Female Athletes \nSue the NCAA, Independent Council on Women’s Sports, https://www.iconswomen.com/take-on-\nthe-ncaa/#filing (last visited Apr. 26, 2024).  \n52 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 53 of 83 - Page ID#: 53\n \ncannot justify enforcing sex separation—contrary to the premise of Title IX’s express exclusions \nand longstanding regulatory history.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818-19.  And the Final Rule leaves schools \nto largely guess at how to apply its reasoning regarding sports, beyond making clear that schools \nwill violate Title IX by enforcing uniform rules against dividing sports based on sex rather than \ngender identity.  Id. at 33,817.         \n174.  The Department identifies many millions in costs arising from compliance with the \nFinal Rule’s gender-identity mandate.  See id. at 33,878; see also infra ¶¶ 174, 188.  But it claims \nthat the “non-monetary benefits of providing clarity and recognizing the broad scope of Title IX’s \nprotections”—unquantified benefits—“justify” all the associated expenses.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,877, 33,878.  The Department does not account for the “non-monetary” harms of allowing \nwomen to be displaced from sports teams, scholarships, championships, and awards by men.  \nB.  Broadened Definition of Prohibited “Harassment.” \n175.  In addition to expanding the meaning of “sex” discrimination, the Final Rule wid-\nens the speech and expression subject to Title IX’s limit on “hostile environment sex-based har-\nassment.”  Id. at 33,496.   \n176.  As discussed, the 2020 Rule aligned the definition of Title IX harassment with both \nthe Supreme Court’s formulation in Davis and First Amendment considerations.  The 2020 Rule \ndid so by requiring that harassment involve conduct that is “severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive.”  Supra ¶¶ 85-86.   \n177.  The Department rejects the 2020 Rule’s approach and replaces it with a new defi-\nnition of harassment that is broader in critical ways.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (amending 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.2).  First, harassment need only be “severe” or “pervasive”—meaning even a “single \nserious” instance of unwelcome speech, or a pattern of non-severe incidents, might count.  Id. at \n53 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 54 of 83 - Page ID#: 54\n \n33,500.  Second, harassment covers conduct that is “subjectively and objectively” offensive as \nmeasured from the “the complainant’s position”—meaning transgender persons’ views on what \nharms gender identity controls the analysis.  Id. at 33,510.  Third, harassment is anything that \n“limits” a person’s “ability to participate” in an educational program or activity—requiring only \n“some impact” on a student’s ability to participate, without any “particular limits or denials.”  Id. \nat 33,511.   \n178.  The Final Rule declines to limit its new definition of harassment to speech that \noccurs on school campuses.  Instead, the Title IX harassment obligations are triggered whenever \na school employee “has information about conduct among students that took place on social media \nor other platforms.”  Id. at 33,535.  Online conduct subject to harassment inquiry could include \n“sex-based derogatory name-calling” or “sending sex-based … cartoons,” among any other “sex-\nbased conduct” that might be “reasonably” viewed as harassing.  Id. at 33,515.        \n179.  The Department acknowledges commenters’ concern that the new definition of har-\nassment will infringe individuals’ “freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion.”  Id. at \n33,502.  Yet the Final Rule responds only with boilerplate language that it does not “restrict[] any \nrights that would otherwise be protected from government action by the First Amendment.”  See, \ne.g., id. at 33,500, 33,503, 33,506, 33,507, 33,508, 33,535, 33,542, 33,559.   \n180.  In downplaying commenters’ First Amendment concerns, the Department does not \ndiscuss its prior guidance, enforcement history, or cited EEOC guidance, all of which set out a \nnarrow view of protected speech in the gender-identity context.  See supra ¶ 82; 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,516 (incorporating EEOC gender-identity guidance); see also EEOC, Proposed Enforcement \nGuidance on Harassment in the Workplace, 88 Fed. Reg. 67,750 (Oct. 2, 2023) (permitting em-\nployees to “misgender” co-workers violates Title VII), https://perma.cc/VY3Y-RCE8.   \n54 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 55 of 83 - Page ID#: 55\n \n181.  The Final Rule likewise declines to address commenters’ particular examples of \nspeech-infringing enforcement of Title IX because it cannot judge “factual scenarios” before they \narise.  E.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,507.  The Department for instance declines to say whether so-called \n“misgendering” may constitute actionable harassment because addressing this topic is allegedly \ntoo “fact-specific.”  Id. at 33,516.  Yet the Final Rule elsewhere provides “[e]xamples” of actions \nTitle IX might require or cover, id. at 33,515, 33,525, as does EEOC’s harassment and related \nguidance, which the Department elsewhere cites.  Supra ¶ 162; EEOC, Sexual Orientation and \nGender Identity (SOGI) Discrimination, https://perma.cc/W3MG-DEZB (last visited Apr. 27, \n2024) (cited at 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516) (“intentionally and repeatedly using the wrong name and \npronouns to refer to a transgender employee could contribute to an unlawful hostile work environ-\nment”). \n182.  In all events, the Final Rule suggests that it could overcome any First Amendment \nchallenge.  The Department explains that “eradicating discrimination”—including, in the Final \nRule’s view, failure to adopt students’ gender identities—is the type of compelling interest that \ncould satisfy strict scrutiny and override limits on inhibiting otherwise protected speech or reli-\ngious free exercise.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,503 (citation omitted). \n183.  The Final Rule instructs that Title IX administrators are to take “prompt[]” action \nto investigate and respond to any speech that “reasonably may” constitute harassment.  Id. at \n33,509, 33,533, 33,562.  Such responses might include “educational programming” or “employee \ntraining,” id. at 33,599, as well as “emergency removal” of alleged offenders from educational \nprograms and activities, id. at 33,616; see also id. at 33,890 (amended 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(h)).     \n* * * \n55 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 56 of 83 - Page ID#: 56\n \n184.  Putting all of this together, the resulting Title IX regime leaves schools to navigate \na conflicting web of rules for assessing whether and how they apply sex-based distinctions in the \neducational sphere.  But at least a few things are clear.  No State or recipient school can exclude a \nstudent from using the bathroom, locker room, or other private changing or showering space that \naligns with that student’s self-professed gender identity, no matter their sex.  No State or recipient \nschool can maintain laws or rules that require eligibility for all sports teams and competitions to \nbe based on athletes’ sex.  And no State can protect teachers’ and students’ right not to speak in \nways that a student might view as offensive to the student’s subjective gender identity.   \n185.  The Final Rule’s effective date of August 1, 2024, means that these and other De-\npartment directives will apply when the next school year begins.  Id. at 33,474.   \nIRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS \n186.  The Department’s Final Rule inflicts significant, irreparable harms on Plaintiff \nStates that only prompt judicial intervention can redress.   \n187.  First, Plaintiff States would suffer the “irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compli-\nance costs.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal \nCo. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in the judgment)); cf. \nKentucky v. Fed. Highway Admin., No. 5:23-cv-162-BJB, ---F. Supp. 3d----, 2024 WL 1402443, \nat *3 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 1, 2024) (noting such costs establish an injury for standing purposes).   \n188.  The Final Rule acknowledges as much: It states that § 106.32(1)(2) would require \nschools that do not already have policies governing the directed treatment of students based on \ngender identity to incur costs related to “review” of current policies, “updating of policies or train-\ning materials,” and “train[ing] of employees or students on gender identity discrimination.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,876.  Indeed, the Department estimates that simply “reading and understanding the \n56 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 57 of 83 - Page ID#: 57\n \nfinal regulations” will have a one-time cost of more than $24 million across all recipients.  Id. at \n33,867.  Providing new training for school administrators, faculty and teachers, and Title IX coor-\ndinators will require many more millions—as the Final Rule also concedes.  Yet sovereign im-\nmunity means Plaintiff States could not later recover these substantial compliance sums, showing \ntextbook irreparable harm.  Biden, 57 F.4th at 556; see Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. \n758, 765 (2021) (“no guarantee of eventual recovery” of monies owed was irreparable harm). \n189.  Second, enforcement of the Final Rule threatens to collectively strip Plaintiff States \nof billions of dollars in federal Title IX funds and to impose substantial penalties through private \nsuits.  This severe financial exposure in turn endangers important programs that serve attendees of \nPlaintiff States’ schools and higher-education institutions. \n190.  The Tennessee legislature, for example, has a constitutional obligation to “provide \nfor the maintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools.”  Tenn. \nConst. art. XI, § 12.  To that end, the Tennessee Department of Education directly operates several \nspecial schools—the Tennessee School for the Blind, Tennessee School for the Deaf (encompass-\ning three campuses), and the Alvin C. York Agricultural Institute—as well as twenty-seven public \nschools in the Achievement School District.  All these schools receive federal funds and are thus \nTitle IX recipients. \n191.  Similarly, the Indiana General Assembly has a constitutional obligation to “encour-\nage, by all suitable means, moral, intellectual, scientific, and agricultural improvement” and “to \nprovide, by law, for a general and uniform system of Common Schools, wherein tuition shall be \nwithout charge, and equally open to all.”  Ind. Const. art. VIII, § 1.  The Indiana Department of \nEducation operates two special schools—the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired \n57 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 58 of 83 - Page ID#: 58\n \nand the Indiana School for the Deaf, id. art. IX, § 1—as well as 1,769 public schools21  across the \nstate as of 2022.  All these schools receive federal funds and are thus Title IX recipients.  Both \nTennessee’s and Indiana’s special schools maintain sex-separated sports teams for multiple sports.  \nAdditionally, Tennessee’s special schools maintain separate bathroom and locker-room facilities \nfor males and females.   \n192.   Kentucky’s General Assembly, likewise, has a constitutional obligation to “pro-\nvide for an efficient system of common schools throughout the State.”  Ky. Const. § 183.  In Ken-\ntucky, there are 1,477 public schools serving primary and secondary school-aged children.  Ken-\ntucky also operates the Kentucky School for the Blind and the Kentucky School for the Deaf.  All \nthese schools receive federal funds and are thus Title IX recipients. \n193.  The Ohio General Assembly is constitutionally obligated to “secure a thorough and \nefficient system of common schools throughout the State,” as well as to provide “by law for the \norganization, administration and control of the public school system of the state.”  Ohio Const. art. \nVI, §§ 2-3. \n194.  The Virginia General Assembly has a constitutional obligation to “provide for a \nsystem of free public elementary and secondary schools for all children of school age throughout \nthe Commonwealth.”  Va. Const. art. VIII, § 1.  There are 1,944 public schools serving elementary \nand secondary school-aged children in Virginia.  Virginia also operates the Virginia School for the \nDeaf and the Blind.  All these schools receive federal funds and are thus Title IX recipients.  \n \n21 Public Education in Indiana, Ballotpedia, https://perma.cc/CGU6-EVPY (last visited \nApr. 18, 2024).  \n58 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 59 of 83 - Page ID#: 59\n \n195.  West Virginia has fifty-five school districts as created by the West Virginia legis-\nlature.  See W. Va. Code § 18-1-3.  These school districts “are a part of the educational system of \nthe state” and are “established in compliance with article 12, section 1, of [West Virginia’s] Con-\nstitution.”  Krutili v. Bd. of Educ. of Butler Dist., 129 S.E. 486, 487 (W. Va. 1925).  All the districts \nin West Virginia receive federal funds—administered by the West Virginia Department of Educa-\ntion—and are thus subject to Title IX. \n196.  The special schools in Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia maintain sex-\nseparated sports teams for multiple sports.  Additionally, Tennessee’s and Virginia’s special \nschools maintain separate bathroom and locker-room facilities for males and females.  \n197.  Tennessee is also home to nearly 150 “[l]ocal education agencies”—school dis-\ntricts—that Tennessee’s legislature creates or authorizes.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-1-103.  Indiana \nhas 291 public school districts that the Indiana General Assembly established as of 2022.  Of Ken-\ntucky’s 171 school districts, 120 are public school districts and 51 are independent districts, which \nare run by local municipalities.  In Virginia, students are educated within 131 public-school divi-\nsions, which are created by the Virginia Board of Education subject to the criteria and conditions \nof the General Assembly.  See Va. Const. art. VIII, § 5.  All of these districts receive federal funds, \nadministered by their respective States, and are thus subject to Title IX.   \n198.  Altogether, educational programs and activities funded through the Tennessee De-\npartment of Education received an estimated $1.5 billion in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2022-23, \nmaking up approximately 18% of the Tennessee Department’s budget.  The Indiana Department \nof Education received an estimated $761,425,610 in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2022-23 for \n59 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 60 of 83 - Page ID#: 60\n \nelementary and secondary level education programs.22  Kentucky received over $617 million dol-\nlars in federal funding for primary and secondary level education programs in 2023.23  In the prior \nyear, federal funds accounted for over 17% of district funding of primary and secondary schools \nin Kentucky.24  In 2023, the State of Ohio received over $5.2 billion in funding from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education and expects to receive additional funds of equal or greater amount in \nfuture fiscal years.25  Virginia received an estimated $1.48 billion for public school educational \nprograms and activities in the Fiscal Year 2022, making federal funds an estimated 15.5% of the \ntotal estimated annual budget.  The West Virginia Department of Education received an estimated \n$731,500,000 in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2022-23, making up approximately 26.63% of the \nWest Virginia Department’s budget.   \n199.  Public and special schools in the Plaintiff States use such federal funds to provide \nsupplemental educational support and materials to students, offer non-academic support for stu-\ndents, provide professional learning opportunities for teachers, offer technology for student use, \nand for other purposes.  Losing these funds would require these schools to eliminate certain ser-\nvices or seek new funding for them—and there is no guarantee that any other funding could be \nfound to cover the lost funding.   \n200.  Tennessee’s legislature also “establish[es] and support[s] . . . postsecondary educa-\ntional institutions, including public institutions of higher learning.”  Tenn. Const. art. 11, § 12.  \n \n22 See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Fiscal Years 2023-2025 State Tables for the U.S. Dep’t of Educ. \n(Mar. 15, 2024), https://perma.cc/753G-GG3H; see also https://perma.cc/92PL-8VKD. \n23 Id. \n24 Ky.

Public higher education \ninstitutions in Tennessee received an estimated $4.2 million in federal funds administered by the \nU.S. Department of Education in Fiscal Year 2022-23, subjecting them to Title IX.   \n201.  In Indiana, the Indiana General Assembly has established seven public institutions \nof higher education.  See generally Ind. Code § 21-19 et. seq.  Public higher education institutions \nin Indiana received an estimated $622,469,030 in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2022-23, subjecting \nthem to Title IX.26   \n202.  There are forty-two postsecondary institutions in Kentucky.  Twenty-four are pub-\nlic institutions, including sixteen community and technical schools.  All postsecondary institutions \nin Kentucky are subject to Title IX as recipients of federal funds.  For example, each postsecondary \ninstitution receives Pell Grants.27  In 2023, Kentucky postsecondary institutions received over \n$423 million in Pell Grant funds.28  For the 2024-2025 school year, Kentucky’s community and \ntechnical schools anticipate receiving over $294 million in federal funds, while the four-year pub-\nlic postsecondary institutions expect to receive over $936 million in federal funds.29   \n203.

Pell Grant Program Funds by Instit., \n2017-18 Award Year (last modified Feb. 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/73LX-535V. \n28 See supra note 22.   \n29 See An Act relating to appropriations, 24 RS HB 6/VO in Part, https://perma.cc/RQT2-\nZM9X (last visited Apr. 29, 2024). \n61 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 62 of 83 - Page ID#: 62\n \nVirginia received over $2 billion in federal funds in the federal Fiscal Year 2022-23, subjecting \nthem to Title IX. \n204.  West Virginia’s legislature has established at least twenty public institutions of \nhigher learning.  W. Va. Code § 18B-2A-1(b).  Annually, public higher education institutions in \nWest Virginia receive hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds, subjecting them to Title IX.    \n205.  These postsecondary institutions use federal funds for many purposes, including \nstudent loans, student grant aid, research and service, veterans’ affairs, and funding historically \nblack colleges and universities.  Losing Title IX funds would require those institutions to eliminate \ncertain educational services or seek new funding.  Additionally, students who rely on federal funds \nto attend those institutions might have their education interrupted, resulting in disenrollment or \nabandonment of a degree or other program. \n206.  By a combination of law and policy, Tennessee public higher-education institutions \nthat offer intercollegiate or intramural athletic teams or sports for “females,” “women,” or “girls” \nmay not allow students of the male sex, as identified by a student’s original birth certificate or \nother evidence, to participate on those teams or in those sports.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-7-180; \nTSSAA Handbook.  A similar law exists in other Plaintiff States.  See Ind. Code § 20-33-13-4; W. \nVa. Code § 18-2-25d.  Under Kentucky law, public and private postsecondary education institu-\ntions that are members of a national intercollegiate athletic association must “designate all inter-\ncollegiate and intramural athletic teams, activities, sports, and events” as “Men’s,” “Women’s,” or \n“Coed.”  Ky. Rev. Stat. § 164.2813(1).  Institutions are required to prohibit a male from competing \nin  any  “intercollegiate  or  intramural  athletic  team,  activity,  sport  or  event  designated  as \n‘women’s.’”  Id.  Eligibility to participate—as well as to use an athletic facility designated for the \n62 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 63 of 83 - Page ID#: 63\n \nexclusive use of a single sex—is determined by the student’s sex at birth.  Ky. Rev. Stat. \n§ 164.2813(2).     \n207.  Plaintiff States thus face a credible threat that the Department of Education will \nenforce the Final Rule against them and terminate federal assistance to noncomplying state entities.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1682; cf. 89 Fed. Reg. 33,543 (amended § 106.6(b)) (“clarify[ing]” that Title IX \nregulations preempt “any State or local law” conflicting with them). \n208.  Third, Plaintiff States would be unable to enforce a number of their own laws with-\nout coming into conflict with the Final Rule.  For example, in many cases, Plaintiff States’ educa-\ntional institutions that offer male-female sports would be forced to choose between complying \nwith the State’s statutes and existing rules and complying with the Final Rule’s prohibition on \ngender-identity discrimination.  See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-6-310(a) (providing that “[a] stu-\ndent’s gender for purposes of participation in a public middle school or high school interscholastic \nathletic activity or event must be determined by the student’s sex at the time of the student’s \nbirth”); TSSAA Handbook (providing for boys and girls teams); Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-7-180 \n(similar for public higher-education institutions); see also Ind. Code § 20-33-13-4 (providing that \n“[a] male, based on a student’s biological sex at birth in accordance with the student’s genetics \nand reproductive biology, may not participate on an athletic team or sport designated under this \nsection  as  being  a  female,  women’s,  or  girls’  athletic  team  or  sport”);  Ky.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 156.070(2)(g)(3) (“An athletic activity or sport designated as ‘girls’ for students in grade six (6) \nthrough  twelve  (12)  shall  not  be  open  to  members  of  the  male  sex.”);  Ky.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 164.2813(1)(b) (prohibiting a male from competing in any team, activity, or event designated as \n“‘women’s’” at a postsecondary institution).    \n63 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 64 of 83 - Page ID#: 64\n \n209.  Moreover, unlike the Final Rule, Tennessee law does not require any educational \ninstitution to allow students to access bathrooms and facilities “consistent with their gender iden-\ntity” and provides that public schools may not accommodate a student’s desire for greater privacy \nin multiple-occupancy facilities by allowing access to a restroom or changing facility that is des-\nignated for use by members of the opposite sex, as determined by immutable biological sex, while \nmembers of the opposite sex are present or could be present.  Compare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, \n33,818-20, with, Tennessee Accommodations for All Children Act, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-2-801 \net seq.; see also Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 49-2-802(2), (4) (incorporating Tenn. Code Ann. § 1-3-\n105(c)), -803(a).  Given that Tennessee gives public school students, teachers, and employees a \nprivate right of action for monetary damages against a school that “intentionally allow[s] a member \nof the opposite sex to enter [a] multi-occupancy restroom or changing facility while other persons \nwere present,” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49-2-805(a), Tennessee schools would also face potential lia-\nbility arising from compliance with the Final Rule’s mandate that students be allowed to use facil-\nities associated with their gender identity.   \n210.  In Kentucky, it is clear that educational institutions will be asked to choose between \nfollowing the Final Rule and state law.  Kentucky Revised Statutes § 158.189 requires local boards \nof education to adopt policies that do “not allow students to use restrooms, locker rooms, or shower \nrooms that are reserved for students of a different biological sex.”  Interscholastic athletics for \nstudents in grades six through twelve must be designated as “Boys,” “Girls,” or “Coed,” and the \nsex of a student for the purpose of determining eligibility to participate must be determined by the \nstudent’s sex at the time of birth.  Ky. Rev. Stat. § 156.070(2)(g).  Additionally, athletic activities \nor sports designated as “Girls” “shall not be open to members of the male sex.”  Ky. Rev. Stat. § \n64 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 65 of 83 - Page ID#: 65\n \n156.070(2)(g)(3).  The language of these statutes leaves no room for Kentucky schools to allow \naccess to bathrooms or locker rooms inconsistent with the student’s sex. \n211.  Similarly, West Virginia would be unable to enforce many of its own laws without \nconflicting with the Final Rule’s prohibition on gender-identity discrimination.  For instance, West \nVirginia law provides that “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall \nnot be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive \nskill or the activity involved is a contact sport.”  W. Va. Code § 18-2-25d(c)(2).  This separation \napplies to “teams or sports that are sponsored by any public secondary school or a state institution \nof higher education.”  Id. § (c)(1).  And sex-based sports teams have been part of West Virginia’s \npublic education system for at least 30 years.  See, e.g., W. Va. Code R. § 127-2-3(3.8) (stating \nthat “[s]chools may sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such \nteams is based upon competitive skill”).  Further, when a student is “aggrieved by a violation” of \nthe law separating male and female sports, West Virginia law creates a private cause of action for \n“injunctive relief and actual damages.”  W. Va. Code § 18-2-25d(d)(1).  So West Virginia schools \nwould face potential liability under this provision from being forced to comply with the Final Rule. \n212.  The Final Rule would also preempt Ohio laws governing athletics, see 87 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,404, causing irreparable harm to the State of Ohio’s sovereign lawmaking authority.  The \nOhio Revised Code provides that “[e]ach school that participates in athletic competitions or events \nadministered by an organization that regulates interscholastic athletic conferences or events shall \ndesignate … [s]eparate teams for participants of the female sex within female sports divisions” \nand that “[n]o school, interscholastic conference, or organization that regulates interscholastic ath-\nletics shall knowingly permit individuals of the male sex to participate on athletic teams or in \nathletic competitions designated only for the female sex.”  Ohio Rev. Code § 3313.5320(A), (B).  \n65 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 66 of 83 - Page ID#: 66\n \nAnd Ohio law similarly requires that “[e]ach state institution of higher education or private college \nthat is a member of the national collegiate athletics association, the national association of inter-\ncollegiate athletics or the national junior college association shall designate … [s]eparate teams \nfor participants of the female sex within female sports divisions” and that  “[n]o state institution \nor private college . . . shall knowingly allow individuals of the male sex to participate on athletic \nteams  or  in  athletic  competitions  designated  for  only  participants  of  the  female  sex.”   Id. \n§ 3345.562(B), (C).   \n213.  Similarly, the Final Rule’s prohibition of harassment based on gender identity could \nconflict with Plaintiff States’ protections of student and faculty speech.  Even before finalizing the \nFinal Rule, the Biden Department, like the Obama Department before it, used Title IX investiga-\ntions to promulgate its view of “faculty misgendering” as evidence of a “hostile environment based \non sex” in violation of Title IX.30  And beyond such enforcement actions, educational institutions \nface the threat of private suit for violations of Title IX.  See Davis, 526 U.S. at 642-43, 650.   \n214.  By contrast, Tennessee law provides that public school teachers and employees are \nnot “[r]equired to use a student’s preferred pronoun when referring to the student if the preferred \npronoun is not consistent with the student’s biological sex.”  Tenn Code Ann. § 49-6-5102(b); see \nalso id. § 49-7-2405 (protecting speech in higher education institutions).  Indeed, Tennessee law \n \n30 Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights An-\nnounces Resolution of Sex-Based Harassment Investigation of Taft College in California (Oct. 19, \n2023), https://perma.cc/47U8-VP2N (finding a faculty comment that a student’s physical appear-\nance was not “feminine enough,” an administrator’s exclusion of the student in addressing female \nstudents as “ladies,” and “almost daily . . . faculty misgendering” created a hostile environment); \nsee also, e.g., Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights \nResolves Sex-Based Harassment Investigation in Rhinelander School District in Wisconsin (July \n6, 2023), https://perma.cc/79G5-F9T6 (categorizing teachers’ use of “incorrect pronouns” as an \nallegation of harassment). \n66 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 67 of 83 - Page ID#: 67\n \nrequires that a student “shall be enrolled in the name that appears on the student’s certificate of \nlive birth” and “shall be known by that lawful name in all facets of school records, report cards, \nstudent testing and any school activities.”  Id. § 49-6-5106.  Tennessee law also provides students \na right to “[e]xpress religious viewpoints in a public school,” id. § 49-6-2904, including those that \nreject the separation of “biological sex” and “gender.” \n215.  Similarly, in Indiana, the law protects the religious viewpoints of students and their \nparents, including those that reject the separation of “biological sex” and “gender.”  See Ind. Code \n§ 20-33-12-2 (providing that “[a] public school shall treat a student’s voluntary expression of a \nreligious viewpoint, if any, on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner the public \nschool treats a student’s voluntary expression of a secular or other viewpoint on an otherwise per-\nmissible subject and may not discriminate against the student based on a religious viewpoint ex-\npressed by the student on an otherwise permissible subject”).   \n216.  Kentucky law prohibits the Board of Education and the Kentucky Department of \nEducation from requiring or recommending policies for the use of pronouns that do not align with \nthe student’s sex as determined at birth.  Ky. Rev. Stat. § 158.191(5)(b).  Additionally, local school \ndistricts cannot require school personnel or students to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s \nsex.  Id. § 158.191(5)(c). \n217.  Further, the Constitution of Virginia protects the free-exercise and free-speech \nrights of Virginia citizens.  In Vlaming v. West Point School Board, the Supreme Court of Virginia \nheld that a teacher who was terminated by a school board for refusing to violate his religious beliefs \nby using a transgender student’s preferred pronouns stated a legally viable free-exercise claim \nunder the Constitution of Virginia.  895 S.E.2d 705, 724 (Va. 2023).  Similarly, the teacher stated \na legally viable “compelled speech” claim under the Constitution of Virginia.  See id. at 743. \n67 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 68 of 83 - Page ID#: 68\n \n218.  As the court held in Tennessee v. U.S. Department of Education, States have a “sov-\nereign interest[] in enforcing their duly enacted state laws.”  615 F. Supp.3d at 841.  In light of the \nconflict between Plaintiff States’ laws and the Final Rule, Plaintiffs “will continue to face substan-\ntial pressure” to disregard their own laws “in order to avoid material legal consequences.”  Ten-\nnessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 841; cf. LaShonda, 526 U.S. at 657-58 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) \n(“[M]any school districts, desperate to avoid Title IX peer harassment suits, will adopt whatever \nfederal code of student conduct and discipline the Department of Education sees fit to impose on \nthem.”).  And any time “a State is [prevented] from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives \nof its people,” it suffers irreparable harm.  Thompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020); \nsee also Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 841 (collecting cases). \n219.  And fourth, the Final Rule would force individual citizens of Plaintiff States to en-\ndure a variety of irreversible harms.  To name just a few: Students of both sexes would experience \nviolations of their bodily privacy by students of a different sex.  Cf. Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d \n1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (recognizing that “most people have ‘a special sense of privacy in \ntheir genitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be \nespecially demeaning and humiliating’” (citation omitted)) (collecting cases); Skinner v. Ry. Labor \nExecs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 626 (1989) (“[E]xecretory function[s are] traditionally shielded by \ngreat privacy.”).  In an effort to avoid such harm, schools might be forced to expend limited tax-\npayer resources on updating restrooms and other facilities to ensure student privacy.  The risk of \n“inappropriate sexual behavior” toward other students would be heightened too.  Cf. Doe v. Metro. \nGov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 35 F.4th 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2022) (addressing allegations of \nstudents taking advantage of semi-private school spaces, including bathrooms, to engage in “un-\nwelcome sexual contact”).   \n68 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 69 of 83 - Page ID#: 69\n \n220.  Female athletes, for their part, would face unfair competition from physiologically \nsuperior competitors, would lose games, awards, and even championships to males, and would be \nexposed to a higher risk of injury.  See IWF Report at 41-50; see also supra ¶¶ 53-60.  Scholarships \nawarded to women would likely decrease as a result—and thereby, educational opportunity for \nwomen would decrease.  And depending on the Rule’s effective date in a particular State, schools \ncould be forced to adopt new policies in the middle of the school year, creating potential disrup-\ntions to student learning and long-term learning losses.31  Judicial relief would avert these harms.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \nAgency Action Not in Accordance with Law and in Excess of Statutory Authority \n221.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n222.  The Department of Education is a federal agency within the meaning of the APA. \n223.  The Final Rule is “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, because it was published \nin the Federal Register following notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. \n29, 2024).  The Final Rule is the “‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process.”  Jama \nv. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 760 F.3d 490, 495 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154, 178 (1997)).  And “legal consequences will flow” from the Final Rule, see id. at 496 (quoting \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 178), because Plaintiff States’ schools must now comply with the Rule or else \nrisk their federal education funding and potential liability under Title IX’s private right of action, \n \n31 Cf. Denise-Marie Ordway, When Schools shut down: How education interruptions can \nhurt student achievement, The Journalist’s Resource (Aug. 28, 2021), https://perma.cc/VBM9-\nBV5L (collecting research). \n69 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 70 of 83 - Page ID#: 70\n \nsee, e.g., S.C. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 86 F.4th 707, 710 (6th Cir. 2023) (affirming damages \naward in private Title IX suit). \n224.  Plaintiff States lack another adequate remedy in court, and no rule requires that they \nappeal to a superior agency authority before seeking judicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 704. \n225.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “not in ac-\ncordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C); Sierra Club v. EPA, 60 F.4th 1008, 1021 (6th Cir. \n2023) (“Reviewing courts certainly have the power to vacate an agency action they find unlaw-\nful.”); Long Island Power Auth. v. FERC, 27 F.4th 705, 717 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (“Vacatur is the \nnormal remedy under the APA, which provides that a reviewing court ‘shall … set aside’ unlawful \nagency action.” (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \n226.  The Department’s redefinition of sex discrimination is unlawful because it contra-\nvenes Title IX’s text and the meaning of the Department’s own regulations.   \n227.  First, the “‘traditional tools’ of statutory interpretation” confirm that the Depart-\nment’s interpretation is “contrary to the clear meaning of” Title IX itself.  Arangure v. Whitaker, \n911 F.3d 333, 336 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Chevron USA, Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 \nU.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984)).  Congress expressly limited Title IX’s coverage to discrimination “on \nthe basis of sex,” and the ordinary public meaning of “sex” at the time of Title IX’s enactment \nunambiguously excludes consideration of a person’s gender identity.  See Adams, 57 F.4th at 812, \n815.  And Bostock, which assumed that “sex” “refer[ed] only to biological distinctions between \nmale and female” and held merely that Title VII bars hiring and firing based on sexual orientation \nand transgender status, does not require a different reading.  See id. at 813-14 (quoting Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 655); see also Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.  Indeed, this Circuit has repeatedly recognized \n70 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 71 of 83 - Page ID#: 71\n \nthat Bostock’s “reasoning applies only to Title VII.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 484 (collecting cases); cf. \nid. at 480-81 (holding that laws barring a girl’s access to testosterone to treat gender dysphoria, \nbut not a boy’s for other purposes, do not discriminate based on sex).  The Department nonetheless \nreads Title IX’s unambiguous prohibition on “sex-based” discrimination to cover action that con-\nflicts with an individual’s gender identity.  And it says this gender-identity mandate applies to \nprivate bathrooms and shower facilities, among other spaces, despite the statute’s clear provision \nfor “living facilities” to be separated between the sexes.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1686; see Adams, 57 \nF.4th at 815 (equating “bathrooms” with “living facilities”).   \n228.  “[A]n agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the \nstatute should operate.” Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014).  Because the De-\npartment’s interpretation contravenes Title IX’s plain meaning, it exceeds the Department’s lawful \nauthority to “effectuate” Title IX’s provisions.  20 U.S.C. § 1682; see also Util. Air, 573 U.S. 302, \n327-28, 334; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  This Court should adopt the reasoning of several courts that have \ninvalidated similar readings of Title IX on this basis.  See supra ¶ 4 (collecting cases).  \n229.  Alternatively, even if “sex” as used in Title IX were an ambiguous term, the De-\npartment’s interpretation would not be entitled to Chevron deference.  For one, the Department’s \nreading falls outside the range of reasonable interpretations of the statutory text because it purports \nto resolve a policy issue of major political significance without clear congressional authority, see \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721-25 (2022), and fails to “construe[ ‘on the basis of sex’] \nto avoid serious constitutional doubts,” Brawner v. Scott Cnty., 14 F.4th 585, 592 n.2 (6th Cir. \n2021) (quoting FCC v. Fox Tel. Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009)); see also infra Claim II.  \nFor another, the Department has read Title IX to impose a new federal-funding condition in an \narea in which States “historically have been sovereign”—the education field.  United States v. \n71 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 72 of 83 - Page ID#: 72\n \nLopez, 514 U.S. 549, 564 (1995).  In such areas, “it is insufficient merely that an agency reasonably \nliquidated ambiguities in the relevant statute”; rather, “Congress itself must have spoken with a \n‘clear voice.’”  Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 354 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). \n230.  To the extent Chevron would permit the Department’s interpretation, that decision \nshould be reconsidered.  Cf. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, No. 22-451 (U.S. argued Jan. 17, \n2024) (presenting question “[w]hether the Court should overrule Chevron). \n231.  Second, the Department’s reading of Title IX violates the “elemental principle of \nadministrative law that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations.”  Meister v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Agric., 623 F.3d 363, 371 (6th Cir. 2010).  Here, the Department has chosen to leave the 1975 \nregulations—allowing sex-separated “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” among other \nthings—on the books unchanged.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,819, 33,820 (discussing 34 \nC.F.R. §§ 106.33-.34); supra ¶¶ 148-51.  But these regulations expressly contemplate and permit \nschools’ dividing certain areas based on students’ sex, not other characteristics like gender identity.  \nThe Department’s gender-identity mandate thus conflicts with these regulations by rendering their \ncore sex-based distinctions “meaningless.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 813.     \n232.  Because the Department’s interpretation of Title IX conflicts with the statutory text \nand operative regulations, it is not entitled to deference and exceeds the Department’s legal au-\nthority to implement Title IX.  The Final Rule therefore should be declared unlawful, “set aside,” \nand vacated.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nCLAIM II \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B) \nAgency Action Contrary to the U.S. Constitution \n233.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n72 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 73 of 83 - Page ID#: 73\n \n234.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”    5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(B);  see  also  id. \n§ 706(2)(A); Sierra Club, 60 F.4th at 1021; Long Island Power Auth., 27 F.4th at 717. \n235.  The Final Rule is unconstitutional—and thus violates the APA—in multiple ways. \n236.  First, if Title IX means what the Department says in the Final Rule, then Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination transgresses the Spending Clause several times over.  See U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  \n237.   “[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a \ncontract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.”  \nAdams, 57 F.4th at 815 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).  That framework means that “if Con-\ngress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys [under its Spending Clause \nauthority], it must do so unambiguously.”  Id. (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).  As this Circuit \nhas directed, this Spending Clause “clear-statement rule” applies with particular force when a fed-\neral-funding condition “encroache[s] upon a traditional state power,” such as the regulation of \neducation.  Yellen, 54 F.4th at 354 (quoting SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 U.S. 159, \n173 (2001)); see also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 564. \n238.  All agree that Congress passed Title IX “pursuant to its authority under the Spend-\ning Clause.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 815.  So, the Department can enforce the Final Rule’s reading of \nTitle IX against the States only if that reading is unambiguously directed by Title IX’s text.  Id. at \n815-16.  As the Eleventh Circuit correctly held in Adams, the Department’s position does not clear \nthat high hurdle.  Id. at 816.  At best, the text is ambiguous, and ambiguous statutes cannot support \nnew duties on the part of Spending Clause recipients.  Id. at 815-16; accord Yellen, 54 F.4th at 354 \n73 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 74 of 83 - Page ID#: 74\n \n(“Congress itself must have spoken with a ‘clear voice’” to satisfy the Spending Clause’s clear-\nstatement rule (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17)). \n239.  The Final Rule also runs afoul of other Spending Clause limits.  To start, given that \nPlaintiff States’ non-compliance would threaten immense sums in federal monies distributed to \nState educational institutions—including some $1.5 billion to Tennessee alone—the Rule uncon-\nstitutionally leaves Plaintiff States with “no real option but to acquiesce” to the Department’s in-\nterpretation, Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577-78, 580-82 (2012) (opinion \nof Roberts, C.J., joined by Breyer & Kagan, JJ.).  Second, the Final Rule impermissibly conditions \nfederal funding on States’ and school recipients’ taking unconstitutional actions against faculty \nand students for engaging in protected expression.  See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210-\n11 (1987); infra ¶¶ 242-44.  Finally, extending Title IX’s protections to individuals based on gen-\nder identity alone is not related, as it must be, to the statute’s purpose of remedying past discrimi-\nnation against women and promoting equal opportunity for women in education.  See South Da-\nkota, 483 U.S. at 207-08; supra ¶¶ 38-49.  For these additional reasons, the Final Rule unlawfully \nexceeds Congress’s Spending-Clause power.   \n240.  Second, to the extent the Department asserts authority to define new “discrimina-\ntory practices” that violate Title IX exclusively “through [its] regulations,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,517, \n33,560, that position would transgress “the Constitution’s rule vesting federal legislative power in \nCongress,” not agencies acting by “pen-and-phone regulations.”  West Virginia, 597 U.S. 737, 753 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Reading “sex” as a term capacious enough to encompass a controversial \ngender-identity mandate, among other novelties, would shift “unfettered” lawmaking power to the \nDepartment in a manner the nondelegation doctrine does not tolerate.  See Tiger Lily, LLC v. U. S. \nDep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 672 (6th Cir. 2021).   \n74 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 75 of 83 - Page ID#: 75\n \n241.  Third, the Final Rule violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution.  See U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. \n242.  To the extent the Biden Administration acts consistently with prior enforcement \npractice, see supra ¶¶ 81-82, 213 & note 30, and interprets the Final Rule to compel school admin-\nistrators and faculty to use gender-identity-based pronouns for a student, the Final Rule would \nviolate the First Amendment.  Cf. Davis, 526 U.S. at 642-43, 650 (recognizing that a school’s Title \nIX liability extends to sexual harassment of a student by teachers and peers).  The First Amendment \nprotects at least the rights of professors at public universities to decline to use pronouns incon-\nsistent with the student’s sex when teaching.  See Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 498-500, 505.  And \ndisciplining a professor or other member of an educational community for failing to follow a \nschool pronoun policy can violate the Free Exercise Clause.  Id. at 512, 514.  Either way, such an \ninterpretation of the Final Rule would flout the First Amendment. \n243.  The Final Rule’s expansive definition of “hostile environment harassment” creates \nfurther First Amendment problems.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,493, 33,884.  Under the Final Rule, this \nconcept covers all expression—even personal speech made in online forums off campus—that \nmight “reasonably” be deemed “unwelcome” and that is so “severe” as to “limit” students’ educa-\ntional participation based on their sex.  Id. at 33,535, 33,562, 33,884 (amending 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.02).  But the Department then defines sex-based harassment to include harassment based on \ncharacteristics extending far beyond sex, including various “sex characteristics” and “gender iden-\ntity.”  Id. at 33,756, 33,886 (34 C.F.R. §§ 106.02, .10).  This broad framework inhibits First \nAmendment rights by chilling, or risking liability over, students’ expression on deeply held views \nregarding significant moral and political issues. \n75 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 76 of 83 - Page ID#: 76\n \n244.  Additionally, by requiring school administrators to “respond promptly and effec-\ntively” to accommodate a student’s stated gender identity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,533, 33,888 (amend-\ning § 106.444(a)); see also supra ¶¶ 112, 163-64, the Final Rule trespasses on the “substantive and \nprocedural protection[s]” our Constitution extends to cover the right of parents to “[]bring [up]” \ntheir children as they deem fit.  Smith v. Org. of Foster Fams. for Equal. & Reform, 431 U.S. 816, \n842 (1977); M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 \n(1923)).  The Final Rule’s statement that schools should defer to parental wishes about whether \n“to make a complaint” about or how “to address” sex discrimination is no answer.  89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,821-22.  That language does not purport to excuse schools from following the Final Rule’s \ndirective that sex discrimination encompasses gender-identity preferences, or otherwise state that \nparental opposition requires excepting students from Title IX’s new reach.    \n245.  Because the Final Rule is unconstitutional in the ways discussed above, it should \nbe declared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM III \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n246.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n247.  Federal law prohibits agency actions, findings, and conclusions that are “arbitrary, \ncapricious,” or “an abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n248.  A federal agency acts in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it (1) “has re-\nlied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider”; (2) “entirely fail[s] to consider an \nimportant aspect of the [regulatory] problem”; (3) “offer[s] an explanation for” its conduct “that \nruns counter to the evidence before” it; or (4) reaches a determination that “is so implausible … it \n76 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 77 of 83 - Page ID#: 77\n \ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or … agency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   \n249.  In adopting the Final Rule over commenters’ widespread opposition and decades \nof contrary practice, the Department has acted arbitrarily and capriciously. \n250.  First, the Department fails to offer a “reasoned explanation” for the Final Rule’s \ndeparture from the historic understanding of the meaning of Title IX’s prohibition on “sex” dis-\ncrimination, which regulations have codified since 1975 (see supra ¶¶ 69-74).  Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016).  The Final Rule retreats from the reality-blinking state-\nment that the Department “does not have a ‘long-standing construction’ of the term ‘sex’ in Title \nIX to mean ‘biological sex.’”  87 Fed. Reg. at 41,537.  Instead, citing Bostock, the Final Rule \nclaims that the Department’s interpretation is entirely consistent with reading “sex” to mean “bio-\nlogical sex.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,802, 33,805.   \n251.  Bostock, though, disclaimed that its reasoning “address[ed] bathrooms, locker \nrooms … or anything else of the kind.”  Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 817 (quoting Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 681).  Further, as the Sixth Circuit has held, “the rule in Bostock extends no further than \nTitle VII.”  Pelcha v. MW Bancorp., Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021).  By definition, Bostock \nthus cannot excuse the inconsistency between the Department’s longstanding view that enforcing \nsex-separation in spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities is not sex discrimina-\ntion, on the one hand, and its new rule deeming such policies actionable Title IX discrimination, \non the other.   \n252.  Such “[u]nexplained inconsistency in agency policy is a reason for holding [the \nDepartment’s] interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change.”  Encino Motorcars, 579 \nU.S. at 222 (cleaned up).  Indeed, the Department’s internally conflicting analysis suggests that \n77 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 78 of 83 - Page ID#: 78\n \nthe Final Rule’s Bostock-based justifications for redrawing Title IX reflect “contrived reasons” \noffered to support a predetermined result:  Effectuating President Biden’s day-one directive to find \nnew federal authority for adopting “prohibitions on sex discrimination on the basis of gender iden-\ntity or sexual orientation.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. at 7,023 (capitalization altered); \nDep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575-76 (2019).     \n253.  Second and relatedly, the Department fails to “engage in ‘reasoned decisionmak-\ning.’”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015) (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. \nv. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)).  This APA requirement means agencies cannot rest on “state-\nments contradict[ing] earlier responses.”  Del. Dep’t of Nat. Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, 785 \nF.3d 1, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015).   \n254.  Yet  the  Department’s  stated  reasoning  offers  “self-contradictory  …  logic”  in \nspades.  Id. at 16 (citation omitted).  The Department points to Congress’s allowing sex-separation \nin “living facilities” and 20 U.S.C. § 1681(1)-(9)’s exceptions as justification for omitting such \nfacilities and programs from its gender-identity mandate.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,818-19.  But \nthe Department arbitrarily declines to extend the same treatment to bathrooms, toilets, and show-\ners, which its regulations likewise permit to be separated based on sex.  Supra ¶¶ 148-49.  Nor can \nthe Department identify a rational basis for allowing school activities and programs associated \nwith Girls and Boys State to restrict participation based on sex, see § 1686(a)(7), yet requiring the \nparticipation of boys identifying as girls in sex-ed classes for girls.  Nor can it explain why its \n“longstanding athletics regulations” support continuing to allow some (unspecified) enforcement \nof sex-separate sports, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817, but the equally longstanding regulations governing \nbathrooms and locker rooms do not.  Nor can the Department defend its assertion that consistently \n78 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 79 of 83 - Page ID#: 79\n \nenforcing sex-separation policies based on persons’ “physical differences” violates Title IX, since \nsuch differences underlie Title IX’s entire statutory and regulatory scheme.  Id. at 33,819.     \n255.  Third, the Department failed to adequately “consider and respond to significant \ncomments received during the period for public comment” on the Final Rule.  Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  Commenters raised a raft of concerns about the constitu-\ntional defects and compliance challenges attending the Final Rule’s approach.  But in response to \nmany, the Final Rule offers only a “handful of conclusory sentences” and “unexplained inconsist-\nencies.”  Gresham v. Azar, 950 F.3d 93, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2020), vacated as moot, 142 S. Ct. 1665 \n(Mem.) (2022); Dist. Hosp. Partners, L.P. v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 46, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  “Nodding \nto concerns raised by commenters only to dismiss them in a conclusory manner is not the hallmark \nof reasoned decisionmaking.”  Gresham, 950 F.3d at 103.     \n256.  Examples of the Department’s flawed approach abound.  The Final Rule claims \n“nothing in the[] regulations” conflicts with the First Amendment.  E.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,500, \n33,507, 33,535, 33,819.  Yet it relies on Title VII EEOC harassment guidance that implicates free-\nspeech rights on its face.  Supra ¶¶ 180-81.  The Final Rule defers consideration of constitutional \nconcerns to future “technical assistance” documents, id. at 33,822, and enforcement actions, id. at \n33,512, saying it can only address “specific examples” with future facts, id. at 33,509, 33,512.  Yet \nelsewhere the Final Rule references examples provided for “illustrative purposes.”  Id.; supra \n¶ 162.  Regardless, promising to address future chaos does not adequately address the Final Rule’s \nhere-and-now legal problems.  See Bloomberg L.P. v. SEC, 45 F.4th 462, 476-77 (D.C. Cir. 2022).     \n257.  Fourth, the Department “entirely fail[s] to consider [certain] important aspect[s] of \nthe problem” or address relevant evidence that “runs counter” to its cost-benefit determination.  \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  The Department altogether ignores States’ practical concerns about \n79 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 80 of 83 - Page ID#: 80\n \nauthenticating gender identity, and likewise sidesteps commenters’ objections that the Final Rule \nendangers privacy and safety interests.  See supra ¶¶ 168-70.  The Department rejects the view \nthat the Final Rule will “lessen[] the force of Title IX’s protections against discrimination that \nlimits educational opportunities for girls and women,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,808, ignoring the evi-\ndence that men identifying as women have already taken such opportunities from women, see \nsupra ¶ 172.  The Department fails to consider evidence of the biological differences between men \nand women that have long justified sex-separated facilities, certain sex-separated classes, and sex-\nseparated sports.  See supra ¶ 13.  And the Department downplays the grave compliance challenges \nwith structuring school operations based on internal notions of gender identity that are subjective \nand subject to change.  Tennessee Programs-and-Facilities Comment at 8-9. \n258.  For any and all of the preceding reasons, the Secretary’s promulgation of the Final \nRule was “arbitrary [and] capricious” and an “abuse of [agency] discretion,” and the Rule should \ntherefore be declared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM IV \nRelief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 5 U.S.C. § 706 \nClaim for Declaratory Judgment Against Defendants \n259.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n260.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that “[i]n a case of actual controversy \nwithin its jurisdiction … any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, \nmay declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n261.  This case presents an actual controversy.  The Final Rule operates on recipients of \nTitle IX funds directly, meaning its requirements affect their legal rights.  Moreover, the imminent \nenforcement of the Department’s Final Rule threatens to force state recipients of Title IX funding \n80 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 81 of 83 - Page ID#: 81\n \nto choose between violating State Plaintiffs’ laws and abandoning consistent policies or losing \ntheir Title IX funding—funding that amounts to many billions annually. \n262.  The controversy involves questions of federal law and thus arises in this Court’s \njurisdiction.  Venue is proper, as the Commonwealth of Kentucky resides in this District.   \n263.  Through this Complaint, the Plaintiff States have filed an appropriate pleading to \nhave their rights declared.  The Court can resolve this controversy by declaring that Plaintiffs have \na right to Title IX funding notwithstanding state policies and legal directives that students partici-\npate in covered education programs and activities based on their sex, not gender identity. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nAn actual controversy exists between the parties that entitles Plaintiff States to declaratory \nand injunctive relief.  Plaintiff States request that this Court: \na)  Enter a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and a prelimi-\nnary injunction enjoining Defendants, and any other agency or employee of the \nUnited States, from enforcing or implementing the portions of the Final Rule that \nviolate Title IX, the APA, and the U.S. Constitution; \nb)  Enter a judgment declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 5 U.S.C. § 706, that \n(i) the Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX is unlawful; (ii) that the Final Rule is \narbitrary and capricious; and (iii) that the Plaintiff States, their political subdivi-\nsions, and their resident institutions may continue receiving Title IX funding not-\nwithstanding any failure to adhere to the Final Rule’s unlawful requirements; \nc)  Set aside and vacate the Final Rule on the basis that it violates Title IX, the APA, \nand the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706; \n81 \n \n\nCase: 2:24-cv-00072-DLB-CJS   Doc #: 1   Filed: 04/30/24   Page: 82 of 83 - Page ID#: 82\n \nd)  Permanently enjoin Defendants from withholding Title IX funding from Plaintiff \nStates, their political subdivisions, and resident institutions for refusing to comply \nwith the Final Rule’s unlawful requirements; and \ne)  Grant any and all other relief the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: April 30, 2024         Respectfully submitted, \n         \n \n   \n \n   \n________________________  ______________________________ \nRUSSELL COLEMAN  JONATHAN SKRMETTI \n   Attorney General     Attorney General and Reporter \n   \n/s/ Justin D.
