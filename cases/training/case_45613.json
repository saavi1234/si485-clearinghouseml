    "summary": "<p>This case is a challenge to the Biden administration's interpretation of Title IX. On April 19, 2024, the Department of Education announced an interpretation of Title IX (\"the Final Rule\"), to go into effect on August 1, 2024, that gave LGBTQ+ students and others explicit protection from sex discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo; The Final Rule also broadened the definition of prohibited harassment under Title IX. On May 6, 2024, Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Secretary of Education and the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Oklahoma sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and vacatur of the Final Rule. District Judge Joe Heaton was originally assigned to the case, but District Judge Jodi W. Dishman took over the case on May 8, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>Oklahoma argued that the Final Rule contradicted the text of Title IX and was arbitrary and capricious. It also contended that the Final Rule violated the Constitution in several ways. First, the state argued that the Final Rule violated the Spending Clause by, among other things, imposing conditions on federal funds without unambiguous statutory text. It also argued that the Final Rule purported to require administrators and teachers to refer to students with pronouns that matched their gender identity, which, Oklahoma alleged, would violate the First Amendment's free speech and free exercise protections. Further, Oklahoma argued that the Final Rule's broad definition of harassment violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Finally, Oklahoma contended that the Final Rule's requirement that schools accommodate students' gender identities infringed on the rights of parents to bring up their children as they choose, in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2024 &mdash; one day before the measure was set to go into effect &mdash; the court granted Oklahoma's motion for preliminary injunction, thus enjoining the federal government from implementing or enforcing the Final Rule in Oklahoma. 743 F.Supp.3d 1314. The court held that Oklahoma was substantially likely to succeed on the merits of its statutory claims, finding that the Department&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;sex&rdquo; was impermissibly broad. It also held that Oklahoma was likely to prevail on the claim that the Final Rule's definition of harassment violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, and that the Final Rule's conditions on federal funds violated the Spending Clause. Finally, the court held Oklahoma was likely to succeed on the claim that the Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious. 743 F.Supp.3d 1314.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2024, the defendants filed an appeal with the Tenth Circuit, but on March 14, 2025, they voluntarily dismissed the appeal. The case is ongoing as of May 3, 2025.</p>",

Fund v. Pub. Co. \nAcct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 483 (2010) (quoting Immigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983)). Our founders understood that, “[t]o safeguard \nindividual liberty, ‘[s]tructure is everything.’” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. \nCt. 2244, 2275 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring) (second alteration in original) (quoting A. \nScalia, Foreword: The Importance of Structure in Constitutional Interpretation, 83 Notre \nDame L. Rev. 1417, 1418 (2008)). So, “[b]ecause the Constitution gives the Executive \nBranch only ‘[t]he executive Power,’ executive agencies may constitutionally exercise \nonly that power.” Id. at 2274 (second alteration in original) (quoting Art. II, § 1, cl. 1).  \nWith these principles in mind, the Court tackles a question, at least preliminarily, \nthat has not yet been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States or the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit: whether an agency exceeds its authority by \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 2 of 29\ndeciding that sex discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (“Title IX”), includes discrimination based on gender \nidentity. \nBefore the Court is the State of Oklahoma’s (“State”) Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [Doc. No. 21]. The State seeks to preliminarily enjoin the United States \nDepartment of Education (“Department”) from enforcing its new Title IX regulation: \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. § 106, et seq.) (“Final Rule”). The Final Rule consists of 423 pages.1  \nDefendants Miguel Cardona, in his official capacity as the Secretary of Education, \nand the United States Department of Education (collectively, “Department”) filed a \nresponse [Doc. No. 40], and the State filed a reply [Doc. No. 43]. The Court also \nconsiders the State’s supplement [Doc. No. 41] and the amicus brief filed by the states of \nNew Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nVermont, and Washington [Doc. No. 45]. The parties also filed notices of supplemental \nauthority. [Doc. Nos. 46, 47]. \nUpon review and consideration, and for the following reasons, the Court grants the \nState’s Motion.  \n \n1 This is according to https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-04-\n29/pdf/2024-07915.pdf (last visited July 30, 2024), which is a three-column format PDF. \nAccording to Westlaw, the Final Rule is 664 pages in PDF format. 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, \n2024 WL 1833438.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 3 of 29\nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn April 29, 2024, the Department published the Final Rule. The Final Rule seeks \nto “amend[] the regulations implementing Title IX” and “better align the Title IX \nregulatory requirements with Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33474.  \nThe Final Rule “clarif[ies] that sex discrimination includes discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual \norientation, and gender identity.” Id. at 33476 (to be codified as 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). It \nalso imposes a “de minimis harm” standard, which states \n[i]n the limited circumstances in which Title IX or this part permits \ndifferent treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not \ncarry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than de \nminimis harm, except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) through (9) and \nthe corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 through 106.15, 20 U.S.C. 1686 \nand its corresponding regulation § 106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b). Adopting a \npolicy or engaging in a practice that prevents a person from participating in \nan education program or activity consistent with the person’s gender \nidentity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex. \n \nId. at 33887 (to be codified as 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  \nThe Final Rule also changes Title IX’s harassment regulations. Currently, sexual \nharassment is defined as “conduct on the basis of sex” that is “[u]nwelcome conduct \ndetermined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive \nthat it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.30 (emphasis added). The Final Rule changes this term to “sex-\nbased harassment” and defines it as “sexual harassment and other harassment on the basis \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 4 of 29\nof sex, including on the bases described in § 106.10.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33884 (to be \ncodified as 34 C.F.R. § 106.2). “Hostile environment harassment” is then defined as \n“[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is \nsubjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies \na person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.” Id. (emphasis added). Plus, now “a recipient has an obligation to address a sex-\nbased hostile environment under its education program or activity, even when some \nconduct alleged to be contributing to the hostile environment occurred outside the \nrecipient’s education program or activity or outside the United States.” Id. at 33530. \nThe Final Rule does not “articulate a specific definition of ‘gender identity,’” but \n“[t]he Department understands gender identity to describe an individual’s sense of their \ngender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned at birth.” Id. at 33809. \nRecipients of federal funds may “rely on a student’s consistent assertion to determine \ntheir gender identity, or on written confirmation of the student’s gender identity by the \nstudent or student’s parent, counselor, coach, or teacher.” Id. at 33819. They may not, \nhowever, “requir[e] a student to submit to invasive medical inquiries or burdensome \ndocumentation requirements to participate in a recipient’s education program or activity \nconsistent with their gender identity.” Id.  \nThe Final Rule takes effect on August 1, 2024. States and their schools risk losing \nfederal funding if they do not comply with the Final Rule. 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Various \nstates and entities filed lawsuits challenging the Final Rule and seeking to enjoin its \nenforcement. To the best of the Court’s knowledge, almost every district court judge that \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 5 of 29\nhas ruled on a preliminary injunction in those cases has granted one and preliminarily \nenjoined enforcement of the Final Rule.2 \nIn Oklahoma, there are 1,805 public school sites serving primary and secondary \nschool-aged children.

All these \nschools receive federal funds, and thus, are Title IX recipients.3 \nThe State filed suit on May 6, 2024, seeking declaratory judgment in its favor, \nvacatur of the Final Rule, and a permanent injunction keeping the Department from \nwithholding Title IX funding from the State for refusal to comply with the Final Rule. It \nfiled its Motion on June 28, 2024. Expedited briefing concluded on July 18, 2024. Given \nthis timeframe, the quantity of legal challenges to the Final Rule, and the quality of the \nrecent orders filed in the cases granting preliminary injunctions, the Court will not fully \nrestate the regulatory landscape or Title IX’s history. Instead, the Court focuses its \nanalysis on the portions of the 423-page Final Rule that are directly relevant to resolving \nthe State’s Motion. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the State must show the following elements \nweigh in its favor: “‘(1) [it] is substantially likely to succeed on the merits; (2) [it] will \nsuffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; (3) [its] threatened injury outweighs \nthe injury the opposing party will suffer under the injunction; and (4) the injunction \nwould not be adverse to the public interest.’” Brooks v. Colo. Dep’t of Corr., 730 F. \n \n3 The Department does not dispute that the State receives funds from the federal \ngovernment, nor does it dispute the quantity of those funds. See Dine Citizens Against \nRuining Our Env’t v. Haaland, 59 F.4th 1016, 1028 n.5 (10th Cir. 2023) (“It is within this \ncourt’s discretion to take judicial notice of a fact or a document. ‘Judicial notice is proper \nwhen a fact is beyond debate.’” (internal citation omitted) (quoting The Estate of Lockett \nex rel.

Farmland Indus., Inc., 84 F.3d 367, 370 \n(10th Cir. 1996) (alteration in original) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Fed. R. Civ.

Stovall, 341 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th Cir. 2003)). \n \n4 There are three types of preliminary injunctions that are disfavored: “‘(1) \npreliminary injunctions that alter the status quo; (2) mandatory preliminary injunctions; \nand (3) preliminary injunctions that afford the movant all the relief that it could recover at \nthe conclusion of a full trial on the merits.’” Id. at 1259 (quoting O Centro Espirita \nBeneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 975 (10th Cir. 2004) (en \nbanc)). Neither party argues that the State’s requested injunction falls into any of these \ncategories. But even if it did, the Court is satisfied the State has made a “‘strong \nshowing’” that the “likelihood-of-success-on-the-merits and the balance-of-harms \nfactors” weigh in its favor. Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, 916 F.3d \n792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019) (quoting Fish v.

The State is substantially likely to succeed on the merits. \nStarting with the first element, the State argues it is substantially likely to succeed \non the merits of its case because the Final Rule exceeds statutory authority, violates the \nConstitution, and is arbitrary and capricious. As further explained below, the Department \ndisagrees with these arguments.5 \nTitle IX states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance” unless an enumerated exception applies. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Congress \n“empowered” the Department to issue “rules, regulations, or orders of general \napplicability which shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the \nstatute . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \nHowever, Congress also enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) “‘as a \ncheck upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to excesses not \ncontemplated in legislation creating their offices.’” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, \n144 S. Ct. 2244, 2261 (2024) (quoting United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, \n644 (1950)). The APA “was the culmination of a ‘comprehensive rethinking of the place \nof administrative agencies in a regime of separate and divided powers.’” Id. (quoting \n \n5 In its Motion, the State briefly argued that the Final Rule violates the Tenth \nAmendment. The Department briefly responded to this argument in its Response. The \nCourt does not address this claim because even without it, the State has shown it is \nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 9 of 29\nBowen v. Mich. Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986)). Under the \nAPA, courts “shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and \nstatutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency \naction.” 5 U.S.C. § 706. It requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right,” “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction,” or “without observance of procedure required by law.” Id. \n1.  The Department’s interpretation of “sex” exceeds its statutory authority.  \n \nThe State argues that the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX’s text, and therefore, \nthe Department’s implementation of the Final Rule exceeds its statutory authority. The \nDepartment argues that the Final Rule’s “specification that Title IX prohibits \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity is compelled by the statutory text.” [Doc. \nNo. 40 at 13].  \n“[W]hen a particular statute delegates authority to an agency consistent with \nconstitutional limits, courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency \nacts within it.” Loper, 144 S. Ct. at 2273. When analyzing whether an agency has acted \nwithin its statutory authority, the Court starts with the text of the statute. Id. at 2262 \n(“The APA, in short, incorporates the traditional understanding of the judicial function, \nunder which courts must exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of \nstatutory provisions.”). “Proper interpretation of a word ‘depends upon reading the whole \nstatutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any \nprecedent[s] or authorities that inform the analysis.’” United States v. Ko, 739 F.3d 558, \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 10 of 29\n560 (10th Cir. 2014) (alteration added) (quoting Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 U.S. 481, \n486 (2006)).  \n “Sex” is not defined in Title IX. However, “interpretations issued \ncontemporaneously with the statute at issue, and which have remained consistent over \ntime, may be especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning.” Loper, 144 S. Ct. at \n2262. And, as this Court has previously noted, “at the time Title IX was enacted, ‘sex’ \nwas defined by biology and reproductive functions”—not gender identity or sexual \norientation. Bridge ex rel. Bridge v. Okla. State Dep’t of Educ., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2024 \nWL 150598, at *7 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2024). Numerous dictionaries published around \nthe time of Title IX’s passage confirm this conclusion. See infra note 8; cf. In re Mallo, \n774 F.3d 1313, 1321 (10th Cir. 2014) (“Dictionary definitions are useful touchstones to \ndetermine the ‘ordinary meaning’ of an undefined statutory term.” (quoting Taniguchi v. \nKan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.S. 560, 566 (2012))). In fact, the Department does not \nappear to say otherwise. Instead, it maintains that per the amended 34 C.F.R. § 106.10, \n(biological) sex discrimination by definition includes discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity. It premises this argument on Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 \n(2020). \nIn Bostock, the Supreme Court ruled that an employer violates Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 by firing an individual “for being gay or transgender.” Id. at \n683. However, it made clear that the opinion did not “sweep beyond Title VII to other \nfederal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.” Id. at 681. Even in the Title VII \ncontext, the Supreme Court did “not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 11 of 29\nanything else of the kind.” Id. The opinion only answered the question of “whether an \nemployer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged \nor otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.’” Id.  \nIn light of these disclaimers, the Court is not convinced that Bostock stands for the \nproposition that sex discrimination occurs anytime someone is treated differently based \non their gender identity. Yet, that is essentially what the Department argues. “[I]t is \nsuspect that the Department bases its explanation for changing its interpretation of a \nterm—again, whose meaning has been unchanged since the statute was enacted—by \nrelying on reasoning that the highest court said was inapplicable.” Tennessee v. Cardona, \n--- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2024 WL 3019146, at *33 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024). Plus, if \nBostock’s rationale does not even apply to bathrooms or locker rooms in the Title VII \ncontext, why would it apply to bathrooms and locker rooms in the Title IX context? The \nDepartment does not offer an adequate explanation to this question.  \nAdditionally, such an interpretation would be at odds with Title IX’s purpose. \nLeading up to Title IX’s passage, all relevant congressional statements, hearings, and \nreports focused on discrimination women faced in education. See 116 Cong. Rec. 6398, \n6400 (1970) (Rep. Martha Griffiths) (“It is shocking and outrageous that universities and \ncolleges, using Federal moneys, are allowed to continue treating women as second-class \ncitizens, while the Government hypocritically closes its eyes.”); 117 Cong. Rec. 22735, \n22735 (1971) (Sen. Birch Bayh) (“To my mind our greatest legislative failure relates to \nour continued refusal to recognize and take steps to eradicate the pervasive, divisive, and \nunwarranted discrimination against a majority of our citizens, the women of this \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 12 of 29\ncountry.”); 118 Cong. Rec. 5806, 5808 (1972) (Sen. Birch Bayh) (“While the impact of \nthis [proposed legislation] would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an \nimportant first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is \nrightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the \nskills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair \nchance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work.”).  \nThis purpose is confirmed by Title IX’s text. Yet the Final Rule elevates gender \nidentity and its accompanying protections above that of biological sex—i.e., women. \nSuch a contradiction of Title IX’s text and an erosion of its purpose cannot be permitted \nabsent congressional action.6 Of course, the Court understands that the Department only \nseeks to enact regulations that the executive branch believes are beneficial to the nation. \nHowever, “[t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to \nexceed the outer limits of its power, even to accomplish desirable objectives, must be \nresisted.” Immigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).  \n \n6 In the past, when courts have determined that a statute’s text does not protect \ncertain groups of people, Congress has stepped in and passed legislation so the people’s \nwill is effectuated. See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 88–89 (1983) (“[T]his \nCourt ruled that discrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discrimination under \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et \nseq. (1976 ed.). General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 97 S. Ct. 401, 50 L. Ed. 2d \n343 (1976). Congress overcame the Gilbert ruling by enacting § 1 of the Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k) (1976 ed., Supp. V), \nwhich added subsection (k) to § 701 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”) (footnotes \nomitted). That is the proper mechanism for expanding statutory protections. It is not by \nenacting far-reaching regulations or turning to the judiciary for expansion.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 13 of 29\nHaving considered the statute’s unambiguous text, purpose, and other subsequent \nbinding precedent, such as Bostock, the Court concludes the State is likely to succeed on \nits claim that the Department exceeded its statutory authority under Title IX by \nimplementing a regulation that expands sex discrimination to include discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity.7 \n2.  Even if the Department did not clearly exceed its authority, the major questions \ndoctrine counsels against adopting the Department’s interpretation and expansion \nof Title IX. \n \nThe State argues that by enacting the Final Rule, the Department seeks to decide a \nmajor question that Congress did not clearly authorize it to decide. The Department \nargues that the major questions doctrine is inapplicable because the text of the statute \ncontrols, and the Final Rule is consistent with Title IX’s text.  \nAs stated previously, Title IX’s unambiguous and clear text shows the State is \nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits of its case. However, if the statute’s text \ncontained ambiguity regarding whether discrimination on the basis of sex also included \ndiscrimination based on “sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” the major questions doctrine would \ncounsel against such an interpretation. “[I]n certain extraordinary cases, both separation \nof powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent make [the \n \n7 Grounding much of its analysis in Bostock, the Tenth Circuit recently decided \nthat discrimination based on transgender status is discrimination on the basis of sex that \nimplicates the Equal Protection clause. Fowler v. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 790 (10th Cir. \n2024). But nothing in Fowler suggests it applies outside the Equal Protection context. \nAnd for the same reasons as stated above, absent a mandate to the contrary, the Court will \nnot apply Fowler’s analysis to Title IX—a statutory framework to which it is ill suited.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 14 of 29\nSupreme Court] ‘reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text’ the delegation claimed \nto be lurking there.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (quoting Util. Air \nRegul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)). Thus, the “[m]ajor [q]uestions [d]octrine \napplies where ‘an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power \nto regulate a significant portion of the American economy’ or make ‘decisions of vast \neconomic and political significance.’” Bradford v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 101 F.4th 707, 725 \n(10th Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted) (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324). In \nsuch situations, the doctrine requires “something more than a merely plausible textual \nbasis for the agency action.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723. “The agency instead must \npoint to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the power it claims.” Id. (quoting Util. Air \nRegul. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324). \nThe Department’s claim that it can expand “sex” in Title IX to include “gender \nidentity” despite several decades of “sex” solely meaning the biological differences \nbetween men and women falls flat. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 \n(1973) (plurality opinion) (explaining that “sex, like race and national origin, is an \nimmutable characteristic”); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (using the \nterm “sex classifications” when discussing laws and policies that treat individuals based \non whether they are biological “women” or “men”); see also id. (discussing the \n“[i]nherent differences between men and women” without referring to gender identity). \nThe debate regarding the relationship between sex and gender identity is a motivating \nfactor behind countless lawsuits, legislation, and political debates. The enactment of the \nFinal Rule is the essence of an agency claiming to discover, in a statute that has been \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 15 of 29\nenacted for over fifty years, a previously unknown power to decide how broadly “sex” is \ndefined and applied—i.e., a decision of vast political significance. So, even if there was a \nplausible textual basis for the Department’s interpretation of Title IX, the Department \nwould need to point to clear congressional authorization for its ability to redefine sex in a \nway that includes or implicates gender identity. The Department has not done so, and \nCongress has not clearly given the Department authority to redefine sex in a way that \nwould be inconsistent with other portions of the statute. Therefore, the Court determines \nthe State is substantially likely to succeed on its claim that the major questions doctrine \nprohibits the Department from enforcing the Final Rule.  \n3.  The State is substantially likely to succeed on its constitutional claims. \n \na.  The Final Rule likely violates the First Amendment. \n \nThe State argues that the Final Rule’s new harassment provisions violate the First \nAmendment and contradict Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of \nEducation, 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999). The Department argues that the Final Rule has no \nsuch problems because it explicitly provides that “‘nothing in the Title IX regulations \nrequires a recipient to restrict any rights that would otherwise be protected from \ngovernment action by the First Amendment.’” [Doc. No. 40 at 25] (quoting 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33503). Additionally, it notes that the standard set forth in the Final Rule does not need \nto comply with Davis because “Davis addressed the standard required in a private action \nfor damages,” not administrative enforcement. Id. at 22. \nThe First Amendment states, “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \nfreedom of speech . . . .” U.S. Const. amend. I. “First Amendment rights, applied in light \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 16 of 29\nof the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers and \nstudents.” Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). In \nDavis, the Supreme Court held that “in the context of student-on-student harassment, \ndamages are available only where the behavior is so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education that Title IX is designed \nto protect.” 526 U.S. at 652. This standard for harassment accounted for both a school’s \nneed to exercise “disciplinary authority” and limit exposure “to constitutional or statutory \nclaims.” Id. at 649. The Supreme Court highlighted, however, that, Title IX’s “plain \nlanguage confines the scope of prohibited conduct based on the recipient’s degree of \ncontrol over the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs.” Id. at \n644. “Moreover, because the harassment must occur ‘under’ ‘the operations of’ a funding \nrecipient, see 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); § 1687 (defining ‘program or activity’), the \nharassment must take place in a context subject to the school district’s control . . . .” Id. at \n645. \nThe amended 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 has significantly strayed from this standard. It has \nchanged the “severe and pervasive” standard to a “severe or pervasive” standard, altered \nthe “denies” equal access condition to a “limits or denies” equal access condition, and \nadded a subjective component to the “objectively offensive” requirement. The Final Rule \ndoes not define what “objectively offensive” means, but given the regulation’s text, it is \nreasonable to assume that refusal to affirm someone’s gender identity would fall into this \ncategory. Perhaps most notably, it largely expands the Department’s reach outside the \nclassroom and off campus. For example, the Final Rule says  \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 17 of 29\na recipient’s obligation is to address all forms of sex discrimination, \nincluding sex-based harassment that occurs within the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity, whether the conduct takes place online, in person, or \nboth. Online harassment can include, but is not limited to, unwelcome \nconduct on social media platforms such as sex-based derogatory name-\ncalling, the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images (including \nauthentic images and images that have been altered or generated by \nartificial intelligence (AI) technologies), cyberstalking, sending sex-based \npictures or cartoons, and other sex-based conduct that, based on the totality \nof the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and so \nsevere or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in \nor benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33515.  \nRegardless, the Department argues the Davis standard is not binding because a suit \nfor damages is different than administrative enforcement. In support, it highlights that \nprior regulations imposed a standard similar to that which is found in the Final Rule. See \n1997 Sexual Harassment Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, 12040 (condemning harassment \nthat was “sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to create a hostile environment”). \nBut this argument minimizes the Final Rule’s other changes that undeniably further \nbroaden the “severe or pervasive” standard. When the “severe or pervasive” standard is \napplied alongside the expanded definition of sex discrimination in § 106.10 and the added \ncondition that a recipient must address a sex-based hostile environment even when the \nalleged conduct occurred “outside the United States,” the likelihood of a constitutional \nviolation is apparent. 89 Fed. Reg. 33530. Even the Davis Court explained that its \nopinion applying the severe and pervasive standard should “not mislead courts to impose \nmore sweeping liability than we read Title IX to require.” 526 U.S. at 652 (emphasis \nadded). And changing “and” to “or” only makes Title IX’s liability more sweeping. \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 18 of 29\nWhether conduct or speech is considered harassment under the Final Rule is \ndependent on broad statements and vague terminology that the Department has elected \nnot to define. Additionally, the new harassment regulations in the amended § 106.2 do \nnot comport with the standard set out in Davis. This, along with the above mentioned \nFirst Amendment concerns, leads the Court to conclude that these considerations weigh \nin favor of the State with respect to its substantial likelihood of success on the merits.  \nb.  The Final Rule’s conditions likely violate the Spending Clause. \n \nThe State argues that because Congress did not unambiguously state Title IX’s \nprohibition against sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender identity, \nthe Final Rule’s conditions are in violation of the Spending Clause. The Department \ncontinues to rely on Bostock and argues that “§ 106.10 merely sets forth the meaning of \nTitle IX’s unambiguous statutory text.” [Doc. No. 40 at 30].  \n“The Spending Clause provides that ‘[t]he Congress shall have Power To . . . \nprovide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.’” Pittsburg \nCnty. Rural Water Dist. No. 7 v. City of McAlester, 358 F.3d 694, 716 (10th Cir. 2004) \n(alterations in original) (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1). Title IX is “legislation \nenacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause.” Davis, 526 U.S. at \n640. This type of legislation is “‘much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal \nfunds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.’” Id. (quoting \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). “[B]ut when \nCongress attaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 19 of 29\nbe set out ‘unambiguously . . . .’” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 \nU.S. 291, 296 (2006) (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). \nCongress chose to use the term “sex” in Title IX. “Sex” unambiguously means the \nbiological differences between male and female. In the context of Title IX, the concepts \nof sex and gender identity are distinct and independent of one another. Thus, Title IX’s \ntext does not give the State “clear notice” that its acceptance of funds is conditioned on \nits treatment of an individual’s gender identity. See id. at 300. Without clear notice \nprovided by Congress that “on the basis of sex” has been expanded to include gender \nidentity under Title IX, the Department cannot premise the receipt of federal funds off \ncompliance with the Final Rule. Therefore, this element weighs in favor of the State with \nrespect to its substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \n4.  The State is substantially likely to succeed in showing the Department acted in an \narbitrary and capricious manner in passing the Final Rule.  \n \nThe State argues that the Department acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner \nbecause (1) it failed to offer a reasoned explanation for the Final Rule’s departure from \nthe historic understanding of “sex” and (2) the Final Rule is unexplainably internally \ninconsistent. The Department contends the Final Rule is consistent with Supreme Court \nprecedent and that it “is not inconsistent for the Final Rule to distinguish sex separation \nexpressly permitted by Congress, listed in § 106.31(a)(2), from sex separation permitted \nby regulation in other contexts.” [Doc. No. 40 at 27]. \nAccording to the Tenth Circuit, an agency’s decision is arbitrary and capricious \nif the agency (1) “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem,” (2) “offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 20 of 29\nthe evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,” (3) \n“failed to base its decision on consideration of the relevant factors,” or (4) \nmade “a clear error of judgment.” \n \nWildEarth Guardians v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 870 F.3d 1222, 1233 (10th Cir. \n2017) (quoting New Mexico ex rel. Richardson v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 565 F.3d 683, \n704 (10th Cir. 2009)). “The duty of a court reviewing agency action under the ‘arbitrary \nor capricious’ standard is to ascertain whether the agency examined the relevant data and \narticulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.” \nOlenhouse v. Commodity Credit Corp., 42 F.3d 1560, 1574 (10th Cir. 1994). “[T]he \narbitrary and capricious standard focuses on the rationality of an agency’s decision \nmaking process rather than on the rationality of the actual decision . . . .” Colo. Wild v. \nU.S. Forest Serv., 435 F.3d 1204, 1213 (10th Cir. 2006). \n  The Final Rule’s understanding of what “sex” means departs from the definition \nthis term had for decades.8 Expanding the definition of such a crucial term creates \nunexplained inconsistency with Title IX’s text, purpose, and former Department \n \n8 In 1961, the Oxford English Dictionary defined sex as “[t]he sum of those \ndifferences in the structure and function of the reproductive organs on the ground of \nwhich beings are distinguished as male and female, and of the other physiological \ndifferences consequent on these.” The Oxford English Dictionary 578 (1961). In 1970, \nthe American College Dictionary defined sex as “the sum of the anatomical and \nphysiological differences with reference to which the male and the female are \ndistinguished.” The American College Dictionary 1109 (1970). In 1979, Webster defined \nit as “the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living beings \nthat subserve reproduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish males and \nfemales.” Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 1054 (1979). In 1996, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that the “[p]hysical differences between men and women . . . are enduring” \nand the “‘two sexes are not fungible . . . .’” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 \n(1996) (quoting Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946)). \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 21 of 29\ninterpretations. See Dep’t of Just. & Dep’t of Educ., Dear Colleague Letter, Feb. 22, \n2017, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf \n(explaining that the Department is rescinding guidance documents “requir[ing] access to \nsex-segregated facilities based on gender identity” because those guidance documents did \nnot “contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the \nexpress language of Title IX”). This is “a reason for holding an interpretation to be an \narbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the [APA].” Nat’l Cable & \nTelecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981 (2005). However, the \nDepartment says there was not a “‘long-standing construction’ of the term ‘sex’ in Title \nIX to mean ‘biological sex.’” 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, 41537. Although it has previously \n“articulated a narrower interpretation of the scope of Title IX’s prohibition on sex \ndiscrimination,” id. at 41531 (citing 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance at 3; \n2010 Dear Colleague Letter on Harassment and Bullying at 8; Preamble to the 2020 \nAmendments, 85 Fed. Reg. 30178), the Department “now believes that its prior position \n(i.e., that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity) is at odds with Title IX’s text and \npurpose and the reasoning of the Bostock Court.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41531.   \n“Disagreement with its own past interpretation constitutes a concession that a \nlongstanding interpretation indeed has existed.” Tennessee v. Cardona, --- F. Supp.  \n3d ----, 2024 WL 3019146, at *32 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-\n5588 (6th Cir. June 26, 2024). And the primary reason it gives for changing its \ninterpretation is Bostock. But for the reasons previously explained, basing the Final Rule \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 22 of 29\noff Bostock does not reflect reasoned decision making. Bostock was never intended to \nhave a sweeping impact on Title VII, let alone Title IX. “Ultimately, there is little reason \nin the Department’s purportedly ‘reasoned explanation’ for departing from its \nlongstanding interpretation of sex as a binary construct because Bostock did not expand \nthe meaning of ‘sex’ within Title IX.” Id. at *33. \nAdditionally, the gender identity mandate is inexplicably logically inconsistent \nwith several provisions of Title IX. The Department acknowledges that Title IX “created \nexceptions to that general nondiscrimination mandate in 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1)–(9), and \nalso carved out from its general nondiscrimination mandate the maintenance of sex-\nseparate living facilities in 20 U.S.C. 1686.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33818. And yet, the \namended § 106.31 says recipients cannot discriminate on this basis when it comes to \nlocker rooms or bathrooms if such action subjects “a person to more than de minimis \nharm.” Id. at 33887. In application, this means recipients can have male and female \ndormitories and assign students to particular dorms based on their biological sex. \nHowever, for bathrooms and locker rooms, sex-separate facilities are only allowed to the \nextent they do not prevent individuals from using the bathroom or locker room consistent \nwith their gender identities. So, if a biological male identifies as a female, the biological \nmale can be required to sleep in the boys dorm but must be allowed to use the girls locker \nroom. This approach undercuts Title IX’s purpose, epitomizes a clear error in judgment, \nand entirely fails to consider important aspects of the problem the Department sought to \nresolve.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 23 of 29\nTherefore, the Court holds that the State is substantially likely to succeed in \nshowing that the Department acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  \n5.  The Court does not consider the parties’ arguments regarding athletics.  \n \nTo the extent the parties raise arguments regarding the Final Rule’s impact on \nathletics, the Court does not consider these. The Final Rule explicitly “permits different \ntreatment or separation on the basis of sex” in accordance with 34 C.F.R. § 106.41, which \nis the current regulation that addresses athletics.  \nThe Court notes that the Department has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \ntitled, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and \nFemale Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22860 (Apr. 13, 2023). Were this regulation to take \neffect, it would significantly change the legal landscape surrounding athletics.  \nHowever, as it stands, this regulation is not a final agency action. See Farrell-\nCooper Mining Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 864 F.3d 1105, 1113 (10th Cir. 2017) (“As a \ngeneral matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final: First, the \naction must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process[ ]—it must \nnot be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one \nby which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences \nwill flow.” (alteration in original) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 \n(1997))). Thus, the Court does not have jurisdiction to consider this claim. Cherry v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agr., 13 F. App’x 886, 890 (10th Cir. 2001) (unpublished) (“[T]he finality of an \nagency action is jurisdictional . . . .”).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 24 of 29\nB. The State will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied. \nTurning to the second element, the State argues that if the Final Rule is allowed to \ntake effect, it will suffer irreparable harm because it will be “unable to enforce its own \nlaws without coming into conflict with the Final Rule.” [Doc. No. 21 at 35]. The State \nalso contends it will suffer from nonrecoverable compliance costs. The Department \nargues that the State’s claim of unrecoverable compliance costs is speculative and that, \n“[r]egardless of whether the Rule preempts any state’s laws, if the Department is \nprevented from administering the Rule, the Department, not Plaintiff, faces significant \nirreparable harm.” [Doc. No. 40 at 33]. \n“To constitute irreparable harm, an injury must be certain, great, actual ‘and not \ntheoretical.’” Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003) \n(quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985)). “If the harm is not ‘likely to occur before the district court rules on the merits,’ \nthere is no need for preliminary injunctive relief.” State v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 989 \nF.3d 874, 884 (10th Cir. 2021) (quoting New Mexico Dep’t of Game & Fish v. U.S. Dep’t \nof the Interior, 854 F.3d 1236, 1250 (10th Cir. 2017)).  \n“‘[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.’” New Mexico Dep’t \nof Game & Fish, 854 F.3d at 1254 (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 \n(2012)). “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestioningly constitutes irreparable injury.” Schrier v. Univ. of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, \n1266 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 25 of 29\nopinion)). And “[i]mposition of monetary damages that cannot later be recovered for \nreasons such as sovereign immunity constitutes irreparable injury.” Chamber of Com. of \nU.S. v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 770–71 (10th Cir. 2010).  \nIf the State is required to follow the Final Rule, it will be enjoined from \neffectuating laws like Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 1-125—the statute that requires individuals to \nuse the restrooms in public schools that match their biological sex. And as previously \nanalyzed, the Final Rule is likely to violate students’ and teachers’ First Amendment \nrights. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (“Our frequently \nreiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that \nirreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” (emphasis omitted)). Lastly, \nthe State will incur compliance costs by implementing the Final Rule’s provisions, and \nthe Court is unaware of any mechanism through which the State could recover these \ncompliance costs should the Final Rule later be permanently enjoined, and the \nDepartment does not offer any. For these reasons, the Court concludes that this element \nweighs in favor of the State.  \nC. The State’s threatened injury outweighs the injury the Department would \nsuffer, and a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.  \n \nAddressing the third and fourth elements which are merged, the State argues that \nthe injuries it faces outweigh the harm to the Department. It maintains that enforcing an \nunlawful regulation is not in the public interest. The Department argues that if injunctive \nrelief is granted, the federal government will be unable to prevent sex discrimination in \neducation environments, which would have a negative effect on the public interest.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 26 of 29\nWhen evaluating the balance of equities, the Court “do[es] not reject out of hand \nthat the administrative burdens of compliance” can constitute “a real harm.” Fish v. \nKobach, 840 F.3d 710, 754 (10th Cir. 2016). Plus, when a law, or in this case, a \nregulation is “likely unconstitutional” the interest of letting it take effect does not \noutweigh having “constitutional rights protected.” Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1131 \n(10th Cir. 2012). In the statutory context, “our ‘democratically elected representatives . . . \nare in a better position than this Court to determine the public interest[;] . . . [t]he courts’ \npeculiar function is to say what the law is, not to second-guess democratic determinations \nof the public interest.’” Fish, 840 F.3d at 755 (alterations in original) (quoting Heideman \nv. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1191 (10th Cir. 2003)). \nThe equities do not favor the Department and the public interest is not served \nwhen the law is misapplied or constitutional rights are violated. Since the current \nregulations have been in effect for decades, there is little harm in maintaining the status \nquo through the pendency of this suit. Additionally, recipients have only been given three \nmonths to comply with all the Final Rule’s changes. Federal funds that go to school \nprograms, salaries, etc. are on the line. For these reasons, neither the equities nor the \npublic interest favors the Department.  \nD. The Final Rule is preliminarily enjoined in its entirety. \n \nFinally, the Department argues that if the Court grants the State relief, it should \nlimit the injunction to apply only to § 106.31(a)(2) and § 106.2’s definition of “hostile \nenvironment harassment.” The Department contends that since the Final Rule is \nseverable, “[t]he Court should not enjoin § 106.10, which when properly understood \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 27 of 29\ncould not cause the harm that [the State] alleges.” [Doc. No. 40 at 37]. The State argues \nthe Court should preliminarily enjoin the entire Final Rule from going into effect because \nit has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim pertaining to \n§ 106.10, and “the new definition of sex discrimination, appears to touch every \nsubstantive provision of the Rule.” [Doc. No. 43 at 12 (alteration omitted)].  \nBased on the above analysis regarding the amended §§ 106.10, 106.2’s definition \nof hostile environment harassment, and 106.31(a), the Court is satisfied that the State has \nmet its burden of showing these portions of the Final Rule should be preliminarily \nenjoined from taking effect. The issue then becomes whether the Court should sever these \nprovisions from the rest of the Final Rule or preliminarily enjoin the Final Rule in its \nentirety. See 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33848 (“The Department also confirms that each of the \nprovisions in the final regulations is intended to operate independently of each other and \nthat the potential invalidity of one provision should not affect the other provisions.”). \n“[T]he problem is that these provisions, particularly the new definition of sex \ndiscrimination, appear to touch every substantive provision of the [Final Rule].” \nTennessee v. Cardona, No. 24-5588, 2024 WL 3453880, at *3 (6th Cir. July 17, 2024). \nFor example, §§ 106.8(f), 106.2, 106.8, 106.11, 106.40, 106.44, 106.45, 106.46, \nand 106.71 all implicate the new definition of sex discrimination. “It is hard to see how \nall of the schools covered by Title IX could comply with this wide swath of new \nobligations if the Rule’s definition of sex discrimination remains enjoined.” Id. at *4. \nPlus, the Department does not explain how the Final Rule would even operate without \n§ 106.10. Lastly, because of the State’s showing that the Department acted in an arbitrary \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 28 of 29\nand capricious manner in its enactment of the Final Rule, the Court determines \npreliminarily enjoining the Final Rule in its entirety is appropriate.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n“The growth of the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and touches \nalmost every aspect of daily life, heightens the concern that it may slip from the \nExecutive’s control, and thus from that of the people.” Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 499 (2010). Thus, when the executive branch oversteps its \nconstitutional or statutory bounds via agency action, the judiciary must fulfill its role and \nensure the “carefully defined limits” on each branches’ power are not “eroded.” Immigr. \n& Naturalization Serv. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 957–58 (1983). \nThe Court determines, based on its analysis above, that the Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [Doc. No. 21] filed by the State of Oklahoma should be GRANTED. The \nUnited States Department of Education and Miguel Cardona, Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, along with their secretaries, directors, administrators, and \nemployees, are preliminarily ENJOINED and RESTRAINED from implementing, \nenacting, enforcing, or taking any action in any manner to enforce the Final Rule, \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33474 (Apr. 29, 2024), which is scheduled to \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-JD   Document 48   Filed 07/31/24   Page 29 of 29\ntake effect on August 1, 2024. The preliminary injunction is limited to the State of \nOklahoma. The Court does not require a security.9  \n  IT IS SO ORDERED this 31st day of July 2024.  \n \n         \n   \n \n \n \n9 Neither party raises nor briefs the necessity of a security under Rule 65(c). In \nlight of the relevant facts and the State’s substantial likelihood of success on the merits, \nthe Court concludes a security is not necessary.  \n29 \n ",

STATE OF OKLAHOMA\n Plaintiff, \nv. \n1. MIGUEL  CARDONA,  in  his  official\ncapacity as the Secretary of Education; Case No. CIV-24-461-HE\nand\n2. UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT\nOF EDUCATION;\n Defendants. \nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA’S COMPLAINT  \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n1. Through President Biden, the U.S. Department of Education seeks to rewrite the\nhistoric regulatory scheme of Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 by coercing \nStates to adopt a newfound standard for determining a student’s eligibility to participate on a male \nor female athletic team. The crux of Title IX ensures equal opportunity for female athletes \nparticipating in athletics by barring discrimination “on the basis of sex” by schools receiving \nfederal funds. The U.S. Department of Education has fundamentally altered the protections \nafforded to female athletes under Title IX by virtue of mandating “gender identity” into the \nframework of limiting or denying a student’s eligibility to participate on a male or female team. \nState recipients, like Oklahoma, that have conflicting state laws will face enforcement actions and \nthe loss of federal education funding if not compliant with the now formally Amended Code of \nFederal Regulations. The State of Oklahoma brings this Complaint against the Defendants to \nenjoin and invalidate the new Title IX regulations.  \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 2 of 43\nINTRODUCTION \n2.  More  than  half  a  century  ago,  Congress  enacted  Title  IX  of  the  Education \nAmendments of 1972 to promote equal opportunity for male and female athletes. See 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a). The text of the statute and corresponding regulations recognize an “equal  athletic \nopportunity for members of both sexes,” and refer to those two sexes as, “Boy,” and “Girl.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.41(c); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(7).  \n3.  Since the enactment of Title IX, the thematic intent of the statute — providing \nequality for students in athletics — has been carried out by schools across the country. From its \ninception to present day, not only has the statute recognized the natural differences between men \nand women, but so too has our highest Court. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 534 \n(1996) (Ginsberg, J.) (“Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: \n‘[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from \na community composed of both.’”) (quoting Ballard v. U.S., 329 U.S. 187, 193 (1946)). Under \nthis core principle, Title IX granted males and females an “equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, \nparticipate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.” Id. at 532. \nTitle  IX  does  so  by  barring  recipients  of  federal  educational  funding  from  engaging  in \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). \n4.  Indeed, all of the tools of statutory interpretation support reading this statute as \nbarring discrimination based on sex, not the distinct term “gender identity” and associated theories. \nSee Ohio v. Becerra, 87 F.4th 759, 769 (6th Cir. 2023) (“The traditional tools of construction \ninclude consideration of a statute’s text, structure, history, and purpose.” (cleaned up)); Bostock v. \nClayton Cnty., Ga., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (explaining that courts “normally interpret[] a statute \nin accord with the ordinary public meaning of its terms at the time of its enactment”). \n2 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 3 of 43\n5.  Despite the plain and clear scope of Title IX, President Biden’s Department of \nEducation has finalized a new Title IX rule that fundamentally alters the meaning of Title IX’s bar \non sex discrimination. The rule, which takes effect on August 1, 2024, declares that “sex” is an \nexpansive concept whose bounds it need not define. Instead, under the Department’s view, \nunlawful  “sex  discrimination”  covers  “any  discrimination  that  depends”  even  “in  part  on \nconsideration  of  a  person’s  sex,”  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,803,  including  but  not  limited  to, \n“discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  stereotypes,  sex  characteristics,  pregnancy  or  related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” id. at 33,886 (adding 34 C.FR. § 106.10). \n6.  This Final Rule flips fifty (50) year achievement on its head. In doing so, it attempts \nto rewrite Title IX, it ignores the literal text of the statute and the purpose behind its creation, it \ndisregards the lack of public support for the proposed rule, and it jeopardizes the equal opportunity \nthat  has  been  afforded  to  female  athletes  ever  since  the  establishment  of  the  statute.  The \nDepartment attempts to make these drastic and detrimental changes while relying on a Supreme \nCourt case that has no connection to Title IX. Perhaps worst of all, implementation of the Final \nRule would serve to isolate and deny the group of athletes that the statute was originally designed \nto promote and protect — female athletes.  \n7.  The Final Rule then compounds its erroneous reading of sex discrimination by \nadopting an expansive definition of what counts as prohibited “harassment” for Title IX purposes. \nUnder the Final Rule, repercussions risk running to any speech or religious expression that might \nreasonably be deemed “unwelcome,” “offensive,” and “limit[ing]” of a student’s educational \nparticipation or benefits. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (amending 34 C.F.R. § 106.2); see also id. at \n33,562. \n3 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 4 of 43\n8.  The Final Rule usurps authority that belongs to the States and to Congress. It \nviolates the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution by attempting to expand into public school \nissues that must be left to the states and boards of education. Specific to Oklahoma, the Final Rule \nruns in direct conflict with an already existing state statute: the “Save Women’s Sports Act.” See \nOkla. Stat. tit. 70, § 27-706. The decisions of states and boards of education should be undisturbed \nby the federal system unless the state’s action is “clearly unconstitutional.” See Sandusky v. Smith, \n2012 WL 4592635, at *8 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 2, 2012) (quoting Petrey v. Flaugher, 505 F. Supp. 1087, \n1090 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 28, 1981)). Such an action would interfere with each States’ decision-making \nauthority in educational settings, a right established by the Constitution and our highest Court.  \n9.  The  Final  Rule  also  intercepts  congressional  authority.  Simply  put,  the \nresponsibility and power to make new legislation “lies in Congress.” Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., \nGa., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753 (2020) (majority opinion). While agencies do have authority to propose \nnew rules, that authority does not extend to rules which go against statutory language and \nlongstanding interpretation of the law. A founding principle of this country is that the power to \nmake law is delegated to elected representatives, not unelected agency officials. And when agency \nofficials do propose new rules, those rules should not go “beyond what Congress could reasonably \nbe understood to have granted.” West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587, 2609 (2022). In other \nwords, new rules should consider what Congress meant at the time the laws were written. In \ncontrast, the Final Rule attempts to expand the meaning of Title IX in a way that is unreasonable \nand  unconstitutional.  The  lack  of  clear  congressional  authorization  for  the  Final  Rule’s \nunprecedented  gender-identity  mandate also  requires  invalidating  the  rule  under  the major-\nquestions doctrine. \n4 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 5 of 43\n10.  Moreover, rather than provide needed clarity, the Final Rule creates more questions \nand confusion. Because the Final Rule is set to take effect in a matter of months, it will be coupled \nwith numerous issues. The Final Rule would only serve to inject confusion about the treatment of \ntransgender individuals based on the types of sport, level of competition, age, individual skill, \nindividual size, individual strength, and other areas of individual development, among many \nothers. Given that the Final Rule ignores biological sex and allows a transgender individual to be \nplaced on a team based on those developmental attributes, it would force States and schools to rely \non subjective stereotypes about male and female athletes by their generalized abilities, rather than \nobjective criteria like biological sex. This is in direct conflict with federal law. See United States \nv. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (stating that sex-based classifications should not be based \non “generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females,” \nwhile also affirming that biological sex is not a stereotype). \n11.  Plaintiff  Oklahoma  opposed  the  Department’s  approach  for  these  and  many \nadditional reasons. Yet in adopting the Final Rule, the Department failed to respond to many \ncommenters’ critiques or with adequate explanations or substantial supporting evidence.  \n12.  Absent this Court’s immediate intervention, the Final Rule will inflict severe \nirreparable harm on Plaintiff Oklahoma, its educational programs and policies, and its citizens. \n13.  Considering the Final Rule is set to take effect in mere months, Plaintiff Oklahoma \nfaces imminent, unrecoverable compliance expenses and risk of liability in private suits. These \ncompliance sums and efforts will be substantial. \n14.  Plaintiff Oklahoma now seeks this Court’s intervention to protect its interests and \nconstitutional principles, under which Congress — not unelected members of the Department of \nEducation — has exclusive power to pass and amend laws that apply nationwide. This Court \n5 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 6 of 43\nshould stay the Final Rule’s effective date and enjoin its enforcement pending judicial review, and \nultimately issue final relief vacating and setting aside the Final Rule in toto.  \nPARTIES \n15.  Plaintiff Oklahoma is a sovereign State and subject to Title IX as the administrator \nand/or operator of numerous “educational program[s]” and “activities” that  “receiv[e] Federal \nfinancial assistance” within the meaning of Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 1861. Gentner Drummond is the \nAttorney General of Oklahoma. Attorney General Drummond is authorized to “initiate or appear \nin any action in which the interests of the state or the people of the state are at issue” and to \n“monitor and evaluate any action by the federal government including, but not limited to, . . . rules \nor regulations promulgated by an agency of the federal government.” Okla. Stat. tit. 74, § 74-\n18b(3),(24).  \n16.  Defendant the United States of America is the federal sovereign and is sued under \n5 U.S.C. §§ 702–03 and 28 U.S.C § 1346.  \n17.  Defendant Miguel Cardona is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education \nand is responsible for its administration, including the effectuation of the Title IX via rulemaking. \n20 U.S.C. § 3474; 20 U.S.C. § 1682. Defendant Miguel Cardona is sued in his official capacity.  \n18.  Defendant U.S. Department of Education is an executive agency of the federal \ngovernment responsible for enforcement and administration of Title IX. 20 U.S.C. § 3411, 3441. \n19.  Together, Defendants are referred to as the “Department.” \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20.  The  Court  has  federal-question  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1331  because \nPlaintiff  Oklahoma  challenges  the  Secretary  and  the  Department’s  actions  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act’s provision for judicial review of agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 702, \n6 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 7 of 43\nand the scope of the Department’s authority under Title IX, see 20 U.S.C. § 1683 (providing for \njudicial review of “agency action” effectuating Title IX). \n21.  The Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346 because this case involves \na claim against an agency and employee of the federal government. \n22.  An actual controversy exists between the Parties under 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n23.  The Court has authority to grant Plaintiff Oklahoma the requested relief and other \nappropriate relief under 5 U.S.C. §§ 705–06, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02 (the Declaratory Judgment \nAct), and its inherent equitable powers. \n24.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). Defendants are \nagencies of the United States and officers of the United States in their official capacities. Plaintiff \nOklahoma is a resident of every judicial district in its sovereign territory, including this judicial \ndistrict and division, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff \nOklahoma’s claims arose in this district.  \n25.  The Final Rule, by design, regulates schools and other Title IX recipients across \nthe country, including those located in the State of Oklahoma. The Court thus has personal \njurisdiction over the Secretary for purposes of this action because his immunity has been abrogated \nby 5 U.S.C. § 702 and he has “submi[tted]” to such jurisdiction “through contact with and” \nregulatory “activity directed at” Plaintiff Oklahoma and its schools. J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. \nNicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 881 (2011). \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 8 of 43\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \nI.  The Longstanding Purpose of Title IX: Promote Equal Opportunities for Women \nin Education and Sports.  \n \nA.  The History of Title IX \n26.  The United States achieved a historic victory on June 23, 1972, when Title IX was \nenacted as part of the Education Amendments.  \n27.  Title IX’s origin lies in the 1965 presidential Executive Order 11246 prohibiting \nfederal contractors from discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, or \nnational origin. Executive Order 11246 was amended by President Johnson, effective October 13, \n1968, to include discrimination based on sex (renamed as “Executive Order 11246 (1965) as \namended by Executive Order 11375 (1967)”). In March 1970, U.S. House Representative Martha \nGriffiths gave what appears to be the first speech in the U.S. Congress concerning discrimination \nagainst women in education, citing 5 U.S.C § 7151 (1970), Executive Order 11246, and Executive \nOrder 11375. See Congressional Record — House, The Federal Government Violates National \nPolicy, Mar. 9, 1970, at 6398–40.  \n28.  In summer of 1970, U.S. House Representative Edith Green, who chaired the House \nSpecial Subcommittee that dealt with higher education, led seven (7) days of hearings on the topic \nof discrimination against women in federally assisted education programs and employment in \neducation. These hearings were the first legislative step toward the enactment of Title IX. See \nHearings Before the Special Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Education and \nLabor House of Representatives on Section 805 of H.R. 16098, 91st Cong. 1–2 (1970). \n29.  The original version of the bill, which was part of a larger measure on higher \neducation, proposed to amend Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (prohibiting discrimination \nin employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin) to cover employees in \n8 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 9 of 43\neducational institutions. The measure also proposed to amend Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \n(prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program receiving \nfederal financial assistance) to cover sex discrimination, and to extend the Equal Pay Act to cover \nexecutives, administrators, and professionals. \n30.  In 1972, Congress enacted the statute now called “Title IX.” The preamble to Title \nIX states: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational programs or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). \n31.  Although Title IX’s text did not expressly reference athletics, Congress quickly \namended the statute to add the “Javits Amendment.” Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. \n93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 484, 612 (1974). That provision directed the Department of Education’s \npredecessor agency, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (“HEW”), to propose \nregulations “implementing [Title IX’s] provisions[,] . . . includ[ing,] with respect to intercollegiate \nathletic activities[,] reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.” Id.  \n32.  The Javits Amendment supplemented the statute’s general authorization of federal \nagencies  administering  federal  financial  assistance  to  education  programs  and  activities  to \n“effectuate” Title IX’s provisions via “rules, regulations, or orders.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n33.  Congress also authorized federal agencies to enforce Title IX’s prohibition by \nterminating a non-compliant recipient’s Title IX assistance. 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \nB.  The Clear Scope of Title IX \n34.  Many  scholars  attribute  the  dramatic  improvement  in  women’s  educational \nopportunities since 1972, at least in part, to Title IX’s simple pronouncement: “No person in the \nUnited States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \n9 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 10 of 43\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (emphasis added); see, e.g., Jocelyn Samuels & Kristen \nGalles,  In  Defense  of  Title  IX:  Why  Current  Policies  Are  Required  to  Ensure Equality  of \nOpportunity, 14 MARQ. SPORTS L. REV. 11, 18–19 (2003); Elizabeth Kaufer Busch & William E. \nThro, Restoring Title IX’s Constitutional Integrity, 33 MARQ. SPORTS L. REV. 507, 507–08, n.1 \n(2022).  \n35.  At the time Title IX was enacted in 1972, “virtually every dictionary definition of \n‘sex’ referred to the physiological distinctions between males and females — particularly with \nrespect to their reproductive functions.” Bridge on behalf of Bridge v. Okla. State Dep't of Educ., \nNo. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 WL 150598, at *7 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2024) (quoting Grimm v. \nGloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 632 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) \n(Niemeyer,  J.  dissenting)  (collecting  dictionary  definitions)). In  1961,  the  Oxford  English \nDictionary defined sex as “[t]he sum of those differences in the structure and function of the \nreproductive organs on the ground of which beings are distinguished as male and female, and of \nthe other physiological differences consequent on these.” THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 578 \n(1961). In 1970, the American College Dictionary defined sex as “the sum of the anatomical and \nphysiological differences with reference to which the male and the female are distinguished.” THE \nAMERICAN COLLEGE DICTIONARY 1109 (1970). In 1979, Webster defined it as “the sum of the \nstructural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living beings that subserve reproduction by \ntwo interacting parents and that distinguish males and females.” WEBSTER'S NEW COLLEGIATE \nDICTIONARY 1054 (1979). Although not an exhaustive list, the above excerpts alone show that at \nthe time Title IX was enacted, “sex” was defined by biology and reproductive functions. \n10 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 11 of 43\n36.  The plain meaning of this provision negates that it applies to terms like “gender \nidentity” that are distinct from “sex.” As the en banc Eleventh Circuit recognized, “[r]eputable \ndictionary definitions of ‘sex’ from the time of Title IX’s enactment [in 1972] show that when \nCongress prohibited discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education, it meant biological sex, i.e., \ndiscrimination between males and females.” Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 197, \n815–16 (11th Cir. 2022).  \n37.  As for context, Title IX expressly states that it does not “prohibit any educational \ninstitution … from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes,” i.e., “for” males \nand females. 20 U.S.C. § 1686 (emphasis added). Senator Bayh explained that such “differential \ntreatment by sex” was permissible “where personal privacy must be preserved.” 118 Cong. Rec. \n5,807 (statement of Sen. Bayh). It is reasonable that Title IX would not treat the provision of sex-\nseparate facilities as discriminatory. Sex-based classifications like this one, unlike race-based \nclassifications, are not inherently complicated because they are rooted in “enduring’ differences \nbetween men and women.” L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 484 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533).  In other  words, they do not treat “similarly situated” \nindividuals unequally. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 657. \n38.  Moreover, § 1686’s safe-harbor for “separate” male and female facilities “would \nbe rendered meaningless” if “sex” did not refer to a male-female binary based on physiological \ndifferences.  Adams,  57  F.4th  at  813.  Interpreting  sex  discrimination  to  encompass  “gender \nidentity” discrimination, for example, “would result in situations where an entity would be \nprohibited from installing or enforcing the otherwise permissible sex-based carve-outs when the \ncarve-outs come into conflict with a transgender person’s gender identity.” Id. at 814. That would \ngrant transgender persons “dual protection under Title IX based on both sex and gender identity,” \n11 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 12 of 43\nimpermissibly giving “‘different meanings to the same [statutory] phrase.’” Id. (quoting Cochise \nConsultancy, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Hunt, 139 S. Ct. 1507, 1512 (2019)). \n39.  This treatment of “sex” as a male-female binary reflects Title IX’s linguistic \ncontext.  “The  phrase  ‘gender  identity’  did  not  exist”  in  1972  “outside  of  some  esoteric \npsychological publications.” Ryan T. Anderson & Melody Wood, Gender Identity Policies in \nSchools: What Congress, the Courts, and the Trump Administration Should Do, at 9, The Heritage \nFound. (2017), https://perma.cc/VG5N-ZAYE. And the word “gender” had itself “been coined \nonly recently in contradistinction to sex.” Id.  \n40.  These  textual,  structural,  and  linguistic  clues  accord  with  the  evidence  that \nCongress enacted Title IX with a sex-specific purpose: to remedy discrimination against women \nin American education by promoting equal educational opportunities for them going forward. \nII.  Prior Regulatory Context.  \n41.  Despite decades of administrative interpretations confirming Title IX’s limited \napplication  to  sex  discrimination,  this  interpretation  quickly  shifted  during  the  Obama \nAdministration when it promulgated that “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to \nclaims of discrimination” based solely on “gender identity.” U.S. Dept. of Educ., Questions and \nAnswers  on  Title  IX  and  Sexual  Violence  (Apr.  29,  2014)  (rescinded  in  2017), \nhttps://bit.ly/44ixq2u. The Department provided no explanation for its reversal.   \n42.  A  subsequent  “Dear  Colleague”  letter  asserting  that  Title  IX  “encompasses \ndiscrimination based on a student’s gender identity, including discrimination based on a student’s \ntransgender status,” compounded this deficiency. U.S. Dep’t of Just. & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. \nfor Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender Students, at 1 (May 13, 2016) \n(rescinded in 2017), https://perma.cc/G5VG-ZNV9 [hereinafter “2016 Dear Colleague Letter”]; \n12 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 13 of 43\nsee also U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Letter to Emily T. Prince, Esq., at 1-2 (Jan. 7, \n2015) (rescinded in 2017), https://perma.cc/4ZRV-8LQ7 (previewing this position). The guidance \nfailed to square the Department’s new reading with its previous interpretation of “sex.” Nor did it \noffer any legal analysis supporting the new interpretation. Instead, it asserted that a recipient would \ndiscriminate “on the basis of sex” if it failed to “treat students consistent with their gender \nidentity,” even if a student’s gender identity conflicted with records of his or her sex. 2016 Dear \nColleague Letter at 3. \n43.  The Department suggested that a recipient’s failure to compel faculty and staff to \n“use pronouns and names consistent with a transgender student’s gender identity” could violate \nthis newly interpreted Title IX. Id. A recipient would also engage in sex discrimination under the \nDepartment’s reading if it failed to permit students to access restrooms, locker rooms, shower \nfacilities, and housing, or if the recipient failed to allow students to participate in activities, \nincluding sports, based on their gender identity alone. Id. at 3-4. \n44.  A federal court in Texas enjoined the enforcement of the Dear Colleague letter and \nrelated guidance nationwide. See Texas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 816 n.4, 836 (N.D. \nTex. 2016), clarified by, No. 7:16-cv-00054-O, 2016 WL 7852331 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2016). The \ncourt held that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits in arguing (a) that the Department \nand  other  defendants  violated  the  APA’s  notice  and  comment  requirements  by  adopting \n“legislative and substantive” rules in the guise of guidance, and (b) that the ordinary public \nmeaning of “sex” as used in Title IX unambiguously precluded construing that term to mean \n“gender identity.” Id. at 827–34. The injunction was dissolved when the plaintiffs voluntarily \ndismissed their suit after the guidance was withdrawn. See Pls.’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, \nTexas v. United States, No. 7:16-cv-00054-O (N.D. Tex. Mar. 3, 2017), ECF No. 128. \n13 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 14 of 43\n45.  In response to growing criticism, under the Trump Administration, the Department \nrescinded both the Dear Colleague Letter and the 2014 Questions and Answers in 2017. However, \nit soon became apparent that the withdrawal could not repair the damage caused by the two (2) \nguidance documents on its own. See Candice Jackson, OCR, U.S. Dept. of Educ., Dear Colleague \nLetter (Sept. 9, 2017). As the Department later explained, neither action “require[ed] or result[ed] \nin  wholesale  changes  to  the  set  of  expectations  guiding  recipients’  responses  to  sexual \nharassment.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,029. Hence, many, if not most, recipients “chose not to change \ntheir Title IX policies and procedures” as a precaution against stigma and liability. Id. \n46.  The Department, therefore, initiated a round of notice-and-comment rulemaking, \nafter which it published a comprehensive set of regulations governing recipients’ obligations to \nprevent sex discrimination in their programs and activities. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of \nSex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. \n30,026 (May 19, 2020) (the “2020 Regulations”). The 2020 Regulations took effect on August 14, \n2020. \n47.  The 2020 Regulations also addressed the question of whether discrimination “on \nthe basis of sex” encompassed sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the Department \ndeclined to define “sex” in the 2020 Regulations because it was not necessary to effectuate the \nrules and would have consequences that extended outside of the proposed rulemaking, the \nDepartment  noted  that  “Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations  include  provisions  that \npresuppose sex as a binary classification.” It further observed that “provisions in the Department’s \ncurrent regulations, which the Department did not propose to revise in this rulemaking, reflect this \npresupposition.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,178. \n \n14 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 15 of 43\nIII.  The Final Rule Defies Title IX’s Intent and Statutory Language.  \nA.  The Proposed Rule \n48.  In opposition to the 2020 Regulations, President Biden issued an executive order \ncharging  the  Secretary  of  Education  to  review  “all  existing  regulations,  orders,  guidance \ndocuments,  policies,  and  any  other  similar  agency  actions”  for  consistency  with  his \nadministration’s Title IX policy. Executive Order 14021, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803 (Mar. 11, 2021), \nhttp://bit.ly/4aWLPUI.  \n49.  In that executive order, President Biden presupposed that “on the basis of sex” \nincluded sexual orientation or gender identity. Id. The Department conducted its review and \nsubsequent rulemaking bound by President Biden’s instruction that Title IX should be interpreted \nas encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity notwithstanding decades of precedent to \nthe contrary. \n50.  On July 12, 2022, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to amend the 2020 Regulations.  See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July 12, 2022). \n51.  On April 13, 2023, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to amend regulations implementing Title IX “to set out a standard that would \ngovern a recipient’s adoption or application of sex-related criteria that would limit or deny a \nstudent’s eligibility to participate on a male or female athletic team consistent with their gender \nidentity.” See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria \nfor Male and Female Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (April 13, 2023). And notably, the \n15 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 16 of 43\nproposed regulation “would clarify Title IX’s application to such sex-related criteria and the \nobligation of schools and other recipients of Federal financial assistance from the Department \n(referred to below as “recipients” or “schools”) that adopt or apply such criteria to do so consistent \nwith Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate.” Id.  \n52.  Oklahoma, through its Attorney General, submitted a comment before the thirty \n(30) day comment period for the Proposed Rule closed on May 15, 2023. In its comment, \nOklahoma addresses that the Proposed Rule erroneously relies on Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., \n140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), ignores the statute’s specific language, and worst of all, harms and restricts \nthe entire class of individuals that Title IX originally sought to build up and protect — female \nathletes.  \n53.  Oklahoma’s  comment  further  addresses  how  the  Proposed  Rule  is  in  direct \nviolation of the Tenth Amendment and the Save Women’s Sports Act. Set out in Oklahoma’s Save \nWomen’s Sports Act, “[p]rior to the beginning of each school year, the parent or legal guardian of \na student who competes on a school athletic team shall sign an affidavit acknowledging the \nbiological sex of the student at birth.” Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 27-106(D) (emphasis added). “If there \nis any change in the status of the biological sex of the student, the affiant shall notify the school \nwithin thirty (30) days of such change.” Id. Female athletic teams “shall not be open to students of \nthe male sex.” § 27-106(E)(1). “Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers \nany direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of [§ 27-106(E)(1)] shall have a cause of action \nfor injunctive relief, damages and other relief available permitted by law against the school.” § 27-\n106(E)(2). Indeed, Oklahoma highlighted that the Proposed Rule obstructs and conflicts with \nOklahoma’s established law.  \n16 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 17 of 43\n54.  Despite these deficiencies and widespread opposition throughout the comment \nprocess, the Department pushed forward and published the Final Rule in the Federal Register on \nApril 29, 2024. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024). \nB.  The Final Rule  \n  \n55.  The Final Rule purports to preempt all “State or local laws or other requirements” \nthat conflict with its terms, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885, and it applies to any school “program or \nactivity” regardless of whether the activity occurs within the school — or even within the United \nStates. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.11) (“Final Rule”).   \n56.  The Final Rule unlawfully alters Title IX’s regime by expanding what constitutes \nunlawful sex discrimination by incorporating so-called “sex characteristics,” including “gender \nidentity.” Additionally, the Final Rule broadly redefines the speech and conduct that constitute \nsex-based harassment subject to intervention or punishment by school administrators and private \nTitle IX plaintiffs. \ni.  The Department’s Redefining of “On the Basis of Sex”  \n57.  Pursuant to Title IX, every school which accepts federal funds is bound by the \nfollowing language: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphases added). \n58.  The text of the statute and corresponding regulations recognize an “equal athletic \nopportunity for members of both sexes,” and refer to those two sexes as, “Boy,” and “Girl.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.41(c); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(7). \n17 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 18 of 43\n59.  The Final Rule is inherently inconsistent with both the text of Title IX and the \nprovisions of 34 C.F.R. 106.41 requiring a Title IX recipient provide equal athletic opportunity for \nmembers of both sexes. The Final Rule redefines the word “sex” to include “discrimination on the \nbasis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10). \n60.  In  accordance with the Department’s reinvention of Title IX, the  Final Rule \nthreatens to withhold federal funding from schools that do not allow students access to “restrooms \nand locker rooms” and comply with any “appearance codes (including dress and grooming codes)” \nbased on gender identity. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816. The Final Rule dictates that a school \nviolates Title IX’s nondiscrimination prohibition if a transgender student is denied access to a \nbathroom or locker room of the opposite biological sex. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818. \n61.  “The Department cannot enforce Title IX in a manner that requires recipients to \nrestrict any rights protected under the First Amendment.”85. Fed. Reg. 30,071. But under the Final \nRule, recipients have an obligation under the Final Rule to “take specific actions … to promptly \nand effectively prevent sex discrimination,” including what the Final Rule defines as sex-based \nharassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. It follows that recipients would have an obligation under the \nFinal Rule to confront students and employees who refuse to affirm someone’s gender identity, up \nto and including disciplinary proceedings, or risk being found in noncompliance with Title IX. \n62.  The Final Rule also institutes a new, lower standard for sexual harassment. The \nFinal  Rule  stipulates  that  “[s]ex-based  harassment,  including  harassment  predicated  on  sex \nstereotyping or gender identity, is covered by Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, subjectively \nand objectively offensive, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny a student’s ability \n18 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 19 of 43\nto participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or activity.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516 \n(emphasis added).  \n63.  In adopting this standard, the Final Rule expands Title IX’s prohibition on sex-\nbased harassment, contrary to Supreme Court precedent. Compare, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. 33,498, with \nDavis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 649–50 (1999). Under Davis, the Supreme \nCourt held that Title IX’s proscriptions included sexual harassment “that is so severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational \nopportunities or benefits provided by the school.” 526 U.S. at 650. The Final Rule ignores this \nprecedent and institutes a sweeping new standard that would subject students, faculty, and staff to \nonerous investigations if they fail to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns.  \n64.  The 2020 Regulations purposefully adopted the Davis standard, “to ensure that \nspeech  and  expression  are  prohibited  only  when  their  seriousness  and  impact  avoid  First \nAmendment concerns.” 85. Fed. Reg. 30142. The Final Rule departs from this policy but fails to \nadequately justify the Department’s change in position and further fails to explain how the looser \nstandard conforms to the Constitution. The reason given by the Department is simply that the \nDefendants “believe[] a broader standard is appropriate.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498. \n65.  The Final Rule also lacks objective standards, making every complaint subjective, \nnot limited to those who visibly identify as transgender. Instead, it broadly encompasses those that \nonly  temporarily  or  intermittently  identify  as  transgender.  See  AM.  PSYCHIATRIC  ASS’N, \nDIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS 451 (5th ed. 2013) (defining \n“transgender” to include “individuals who transiently” identify one way). \n66.  The Final Rule is therefore ambiguous, overbroad, and vague, and it fails to \nadequately notify schools of adequate compliance to avoid onerous investigations. \n19 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 20 of 43\nii.  The Department’s Improper Reliance on Bostock  \n67.  The Department’s reliance on Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020), as a basis to redefine sex discrimination under Title IX, is wholly misplaced. For starters, \nBostock does not support the Final Rule because it involves a different statute, different language, \na different group of individuals, and different factual groundwork. See generally id. Because the \nDepartment relies heavily on Bostock, it must be discussed here; not for its connections to Title \nIX, but rather its irrelevance. \n68.  “Title VII is a vastly different statute” than “Title IX.” Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. \nof Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 168 (2005). Title IX is protecting a separate group of individuals than \nworkplace employees in Title VII. And to state the obvious, Title IX involves an entirely separate \nstatute than the one at issue in Bostock.  \n69.  In Bostock, the Supreme Court addressed Title VII. It held that through the narrow \nlens of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, an employer cannot take adverse employment actions \nbecause of an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity. 140 S. Ct. at 1740. This adverse \naction was prohibited discrimination towards an employee “because of sex.” Id.  \n70.  As if these factors were not distinct enough from the Final Rule, even in Bostock, \nthe Supreme Court noted that “sex” referred “only to biological distinctions between male and \nfemale.” Id. at 1739. It also stated that “transgender status” is a “distinct concept[] from sex.” Id. \nat 1746–47. \n71.  Bostock’s  rationale  was  entrenched  in  the  fact  that  Title  VII’s  “because  of” \nlanguage “incorporates the ‘simple’ and ‘traditional’ standard of but-for causation.” Id. at 1739 \n(citing Nassar, 570 U.S. at 360). On the contrary, Title IX does not use the “because of sex” \nlanguage or incorporate a “but-for” standard like Title VII. Instead, Title IX’s statutory language \n20 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 21 of 43\ninvolves discrimination “on the basis of sex.” See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Indeed, the Bostock Court \nneither discussed nor ruled on Title IX’s dissimilar phraseology: “on the basis of sex.” Despite \nthis, Defendants erroneously blend Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex,” \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), with Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of … sex,” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).  \n72.  Notably, Bostock even explicitly refrains from addressing gender identity in any \nother context than Title VII. 140 S. Ct. at 1753 (stating that it would not “address bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, or anything else of the kind”).  In fact, foreseeing how its opinion could be \nerroneously construed going forward, the Court in Bostock expressly declared that “none of these \nother laws are before us . . . and we do not prejudge any such question today.” Id. In sum, Bostock \ndid not prejudge nor interpret Title IX. Bostock is therefore irrelevant to the interpretation or \nrulemaking of Title IX. \n73.  In comparison, the ultimate purpose of protecting athletes under Title IX is carried \nout by schools specifically accounting for a student’s biological sex. In other words, Title IX \nallows  schools  to  draw  sex-based  distinctions.  It  allows  schools  to  provide  “Boy  or  Girl \nconferences,”  and  “[f]ather-son  or  mother-daughter  activities.”  20  U.S.C.  §  1681(a)(7)–(8). \nSeparate teams are created under the rules to “provide equal athletic opportunity for members of \nboth sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)–(c). These philosophies behind Title IX have stood for more \nthan five (5) decades. Thus, the Department, in enacting the Final Rule, cannot rely on Bostock \nwhen it is distinguished by statutory authority, statutory language, and the group of individuals in \nwhich the statute is designed to protect. \n \n \n21 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 22 of 43\niii.  The Clear Statement Rule and the Major Questions Doctrine \n74.  Even if there were ambiguity on whether Title IX adopts the Final Rule’s definition \nof discrimination “on the basis of sex,” that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the State \nbecause conditions on federal funding must be stated clearly. Adams, 57 F.4th at 815.  \n75.  Congress enacted Title IX pursuant to its powers under the Spending Clause. Davis, \n526 U.S. at 640 (“[W]e have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislation enacted pursuant to \nCongress’ authority under the Spending Clause[.]”). If Congress intends to impose a condition on \nthe grant of federal funding under Title IX, it must do so with “a clear voice,” “unambiguously.” \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). \n76.  This clear statement rule is required when imposing a condition on federal funding \nbecause “legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract: in \nreturn for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.” Adams, 57 \nF.4th at 815 (citing Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). “Recipients \ncannot  knowingly  accept  the  deal  with  the  Federal  Government  unless  they  would  clearly \nunderstand the obligations that would come along with doing so.” Cummings v. Premier Rehab \nKeller, PLLC, 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) (internal quotations omitted). \n77.  The use of the word “sex” in Title IX did not put educational institutions and \nprograms on notice that by accepting funding from the federal government for educational services \nand activities, they are prohibited from providing bathrooms or other facilities for the two sexes. \nSee Adams, 57 F.4th at 816. That is clear not only from historical practice but from Defendants’ \nlongstanding  interpretation  of  Title  IX  and  its  implementing  regulations,  which  “include \nprovisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,178. \n22 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 23 of 43\n78.  Similarly, courts will not assume that Congress has assigned questions of “deep \neconomic and political significance” to an agency unless Congress has done so expressly. See King \nv. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015); FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n160 (2000). \n79.  “We expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise \npowers of vast economic and political significance.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. \n302, 324 (2014)). \n80.  Congress typically [does not] use oblique or elliptical language to empower an \nagency to make a radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme …We presume that \nCongress intends to make major policy decisions itself, not leave those decisions to agencies.” Id. \n(cleaned up); see also Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 160. \n81.  The Final Rule will affect all elementary schools, secondary schools, postsecondary \ninstitutions, and other recipients of federal financial funds with far-reaching social and economic \nimpact. Yet Title IX’s language cannot be plausibly read to smuggle in a power for federal agencies \nto  overturn  the  “unremarkable  —  and  nearly  universal  —  practice[s]”  common  in  States’ \ngovernance of schools. Adams, 57 F.4th at 796. \nIRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFF OKLAHOMA \n82.  The Department’s Final Rule inflicts significant, irreparable harm on Plaintiff \nOklahoma that only prompt judicial intervention can redress. \n83.  First, Plaintiff Oklahoma is unable to enforce its own laws without coming into \nconflict with the Final Rule. For example, Plaintiff Oklahoma’s educational institutions that offer \n23 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 24 of 43\nmale and female sports are forced to choose between complying with the Oklahoma’s statutes and \nexisting rules or complying with the Final Rule’s prohibition on gender-identity discrimination.  \n84.  The Final Rule preempts Oklahoma laws governing athletics and causes irreparable \nharm to the State of Oklahoma’s sovereign lawmaking authority. Set out in Oklahoma’s Save \nWomen’s Sports Act, “[p]rior to the beginning of each school year, the parent or legal guardian of \na student who competes on a school athletic team shall sign an affidavit acknowledging the \nbiological sex of the student at birth.” Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 27-106(D) (emphasis added).1  “If there \nis any change in the status of the biological sex of the student, the affiant shall notify the school \nwithin thirty (30) days of such change.” Id. Female athletic teams “shall not be open to students of \nthe male sex.” § 27-106(E)(1). “Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers \nany direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of [§ 27-106(E)(1)] shall have a cause of action \nfor injunctive relief, damages and other relief available permitted by law against the school.” § 27-\n106(E)(2).  \n85.  Similarly, the Final Rule’s prohibition of harassment based on gender identity \nconflicts with Oklahoma’s protections of student and faculty speech. See Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 24-\n157; Okla. Admin. Code.  § 210:10-1-23. Even before finalizing the Final Rule, the Biden \nDepartment, like the Obama Department before it, used Title IX investigations to promulgate its \nview of “faculty misgendering” as evidence of a “hostile environment based on sex” in violation \nof Title IX. And beyond such enforcement actions, educational institutions face the threat of \nprivate suit for violations of Title IX. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 642–43, 650. \n86.  Oklahoma law provides that an employee or student of a public school or charter \nschool “shall not be required, as a condition of employment, enrollment, or participation in any \n \n1 If the student is eighteen (18) years of age, that student will sign the affidavit “acknowledging his or her biological \nsex at birth.” Id. \n24 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 25 of 43\nprogram, to refer to another person using that person’s preferred title or pronouns if the personal \ntitle or pronouns do not correspond to that person’s sex.”  H.B. 3120.  \n87.  Second,  Plaintiff  Oklahoma  suffers  the  “irreparable  harm  of  nonrecoverable \ncompliance costs.” Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220–21 (1994) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in part and in the judgment); Cloud Peak Energy Inc. v. United States Dep't of Interior, \n415 F. Supp. 3d 1034, 1042 (D. Wyo. 2019) (recognizing that the Tenth Circuit has previously \nheld that unrecoverable economic costs can constitute irreparable harm). \n88.  Third,  enforcement  of  the  Final  Rule  threatens  to  collectively  strip  Plaintiff \nOklahoma of millions of dollars in federal Title IX funds and to impose substantial penalties \nthrough private suits. This severe financial exposure in turn endangers important programs that \nserve attendees of Plaintiff Oklahoma’s schools and higher-education institutions. \n89.  In Oklahoma, there are 1,720 public schools serving primary and secondary school-\naged children. Oklahoma also operates the Oklahoma School for the Blind and the Oklahoma \nSchool for the Deaf. All these schools receive federal funds and are thus Title IX recipients. \n90.  In 2023, the federal government allocated $224,661,041 to the Oklahoma State \nDepartment of Education to fund Oklahoma schools.2  \n91.  Public  and  special  schools  in  Oklahoma  use  such  federal  funds  to  provide \nsupplemental educational support and materials to students, offer non-academic support for \nstudents, provide professional learning opportunities for teachers, offer technology for student use, \nand for other purposes. Losing these funds will require these schools to eliminate certain services \n \n2 Office of Elementary & Secondary Education, Funding Status & Awards, DEPT. OF EDUC. (July 7, 2023), \nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/school-support-and-accountability/title-i-part-a-\nprogram/funding-status/. \n25 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 26 of 43\nor seek new funding for them — and there is no guarantee that any other funding will be found to \ncover the lost funding. \n92.  Oklahoma hosts twenty-five (25) public colleges and universities benefiting higher \neducation. See generally Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 3101 et. seq. All post-secondary education programs \nreceived approximately $350 million in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2022-23,3 subjecting them to \nTitle IX.   \n93.  These postsecondary institutions use federal funds for many purposes, including \nstudent loans, student grant aid, research and service, and veterans’ affairs. Losing Title IX funds \nwill require those institutions to eliminate certain educational services or seek new funding. \nAdditionally, students who rely on federal funds to attend those institutions might have their \neducation interrupted, resulting in disenrollment or abandonment of a degree or other program. \n94.  Under Oklahoma law, postsecondary athletic teams that are sponsored by a school \nor sponsored by a private school whose students or teams compete against a school, “shall be \nexpressly designated as” . . . “Men’s,” “Women’s,” or “Coed.” Okla. Stat. tit. 70 § 27-106(C).  \n95.  Plaintiff Oklahoma thus faces a credible threat that the Department of Education \nwill enforce the Final Rule against them and terminate federal assistance to noncomplying state \nentities. See 20 U.S.C. § 1682; cf. 89 Fed. Reg. 33,543 (amended § 106.6(b)) (“clarify[ing]” that \nTitle IX regulations preempt “any State or local law” conflicting with them). \n96.  Lastly, the Final Rule will force individual citizens of Plaintiff Oklahoma to endure \na variety of irreversible harms.  \n97.  Students of both sexes will experience violations of their bodily privacy by students \nof a different sex. Indeed, the Final Rule also ignores psychological and safety concerns. For \n \n3 See U.S. Dept. of Educ., Fiscal Years 2023-2025 State Tables for the U.S. Department of Education, \nhttps://perma.cc/753G-GG3H (last visited May 5, 2024). \n26 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 27 of 43\ninstance, a recent study points out that “limited research has explored girls’ experiences of \ncompeting on boys’ sports teams,” noting unique challenges to female athletes. Melissa L. \nDeJonge, et al., One of These is Not Like the Other: The Retrospective Experiences of Girl Athletes \nPlaying on Boys’ Sports Teams During Adolescence, QUALITATIVE RES. IN SPORT, EXERCISE & \nHEALTH (Mar. 9, 2023). Female athletes describe “having to navigate tensions and problematic \nassumptions of girls’ inferiority in sport.” Id. Meanwhile, research shows that female athletes are \nmore willing to participate in single-sex athletics and less likely to feel self-conscious in single-\nsex athletics. See Crystal Vargos, et al., The Effects of Single-Sex Versus Coeducational Physical \nEducation on American Junior High PE Students’ Physical Activity Levels and Self-Competence, \n13 BIOMEDICAL HUM. KINETICS 170 (2021); Kelly Morgan, et al., Formative Research to Develop \na School-Based, Community-Linked Physical Activity Role Model Programme for Girls: Choosing \nActive Role Models to Inspire Girls, BMC PUB. HEALTH (2019).  \n98.  Scholarships awarded to women will likely decrease as a result — and thereby, \neducational opportunity for women will decrease. And depending on the Rule’s effective date in a \nparticular State, schools could be forced to adopt new policies in the middle of the school year, \ncreating potential disruptions to student learning and long-term learning losses. Judicial relief \nwould avert these harms. \n99.  Female athletes, for their part, will face unfair competition from physiologically \nsuperior competitors, will lose games, awards, and even championships to males, and will be \nexposed to a higher risk of injury. “[T]here are inherent differences between those born male and \nthose born female and  that those born male, including transgender women  and girls, have \nphysiological advantages in many sports.” Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 819 \n(11th Cir. 2022) (Lagoa, J., concurring).  \n27 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 28 of 43\n100.  There are simply undeniable differences in “physical attributes that contribute to \nelite athletic performance” of a male versus a female in athletics. See The Role of Testosterone in \nAthletic Performance, DUKE CTR. FOR SPORTS L. & POL’Y (Jan. 2019). Studies provide the \nfollowing differences between post-pubescent males and females: Males jump 25% percent higher \nthan Females; Males throw 25% further than Females; Males run 11% faster than Females; Males \naccelerate 20% faster than Females. Jennifer C. Braceras, et al, Competition: Title IX, Male-Bodied \nAthletes, & the Threat to Women’s Sports, INDEP. WOMEN’S F. & INDEP. WOMEN’S L. CTR. 20 \n(2021) (footnotes omitted).  \n101.  Specifically, as to studies on transgender females, even those who have lowered \ntheir testosterone levels to a range of an average biological female, they still retain many puberty-\nrelated advantages of muscle mass and strength seen in biological males. See Emma N. Hilton & \nTommy R. Lundberg, Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives on \nTestosterone Suppression & Performance Advantage, 51 SPORTS MED. 200 (2021). “[T]rans \nwomen and girls remain fully male-bodied in the respects that matter for sport; [and] because of \nthis, their inclusion effectively de-segregates the teams  and events they join.”  See Doriane \nLambelet Coleman, et al., Re-affirming the Value of the Sports Exception to Title IX’s General \nNon-Discrimination Rule, 27 DUKE J. GENDER L. & POL’Y 69, 108 (2020). \n102.  Perhaps the Eleventh Circuit sums it up best: “But why does it matter if women and \ngirls are given the equal opportunity to compete in sports? The answer cuts to the heart of why \nTitle IX is seen as such a success story for women’s rights.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 820 (Lagoa, J., \nconcurring). “Affirming the . . . conclusion that ‘the meaning of “sex” in Title IX includes “gender \nidentity”’ would open the door to eroding Title IX’s beneficial legacy for girls and women in \nsports.” Id. Judicial relief would avert these harms.  \n28 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 29 of 43\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCLAIM I \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) Agency Action Not in Accordance with Law \nand in Excess of Statutory Authority \n \n103.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n104.  The Department of Education is a federal agency within the meaning of the APA. \n105.  The Final Rule is “final agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, because it was published \nin the Federal Register following notice-and-comment rulemaking. See 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. \n29, 2024). The Final Rule is the “‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process.” U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813, 195 L.Ed.2d 77 (2016) (quoting \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997)). And “legal consequences will flow” from the \nFinal Rule, see id. (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178), because Oklahoma schools must now \ncomply with the Rule or else risk its federal education funding and potential liability under Title \nIX’s private right of action. See Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290–91, 118 \nS. Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998).  \n106.  Plaintiff Oklahoma lacks another adequate remedy in court, and no rule requires \nthat it appeal to a superior agency authority before seeking judicial review. 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n107.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C); Bradford v. U.S. Dep't of Lab., No. 22-1023, 2024 WL \n1866432, at *16 (10th Cir. Apr. 30, 2024); Long Island Power Auth. v. FERC, 27 F.4th 705, 717 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (“Vacatur is the normal remedy under the APA, which provides that a reviewing \ncourt ‘shall … set aside’ unlawful agency action.” (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \n29 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 30 of 43\n108.  The  Department’s  redefinition  of  sex  discrimination  is  unlawful  because  it \ncontravenes Title IX’s text and the meaning of the Department’s own regulations.  \n109.  First,  the  “‘traditional  tools’  of  statutory  interpretation”  confirm  that  the \nDepartment’s  interpretation  is  “contrary  to  the  clear  meaning  of” Title  IX  itself.  Elwell  v. \nOklahoma ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 693 F.3d 1303, 1313 (10th Cir. 2012) \n(traditional rules of statutory construction mandate the clear law of congress prevail and not a \ndifferent construction applied for an agency). Congress expressly limited Title IX’s coverage to \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex,” and the ordinary public meaning of “sex” at the time of Title \nIX’s enactment unambiguously excludes consideration of a person’s gender identity. See Bridge \nv. Okla. State Dep’t of Educ., No. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 WL 150598, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. \n12, 2024). And Bostock, which assumed that “sex” “refer[ed] only to biological distinctions \nbetween male and female” and held merely that Title VII bars hiring and firing based on sexual \norientation and transgender status, does not require a different reading. See id. ; see, e.g., Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 681. The Department nonetheless reads Title IX’s unambiguous prohibition on “sex-\nbased” discrimination to cover action that conflicts with an individual’s gender identity. And it \nsays this gender-identity mandate applies to private bathrooms and shower facilities, among other \nspaces, despite the statute’s clear provision for “living facilities” to be separated between the sexes. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1686; see Bridge, No. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 WL 150598, at *6 (equating \n“bathrooms” with “living facilities”). \n110.  “[A]n agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the \nstatute should operate.” Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014). Because the \nDepartment’s interpretation contravenes Title IX’s plain meaning, it exceeds the Department’s \nlawful authority to “effectuate” Title IX’s provisions. 20 U.S.C. § 1682; see also Util. Air, 573 \n30 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 31 of 43\nU.S. 302, at 327–28, 334; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). This Court should adopt the reasoning of several \ncourts that have invalidated similar readings of Title IX on this basis.  \n111.  Alternatively, even if “sex” as used in Title IX were an ambiguous term, the \nDepartment’s interpretation is not entitled to Chevron deference. For one, the Department’s \nreading falls outside the range of reasonable interpretations of the statutory text because it purports \nto resolve a policy issue of major political significance without clear congressional authority, see \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721–25 (2022), and fails to “construe [‘on the basis of sex’] \nto avoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v. Fox Tel. Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009). \nFor another, the Department has read Title IX to impose a new federal-funding condition in an \narea in which States “historically have been sovereign” — the education field. United States v. \nLopez, 514 U.S. 549, 564 (1995). In such areas, “it is insufficient merely that an agency reasonably \nliquidated ambiguities in the relevant statute”; rather, “Congress itself must have spoken with a \n‘clear voice.’” Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, 354 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)); see also D.G. ex rel. Stricklin v. Henry, 594 F. \nSupp. 2d 1273, 1278 (N.D. Okla. 2009) (Congress must “speak with a clear voice” and manifest \nan “unambiguous” intent to confer individual rights before federal funding provisions will be read \nto provide a basis for private enforcement.). \n112.  To the extent Chevron permits the Department’s interpretation, that decision should \nbe reconsidered. Cf. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, No. 22-451 (U.S. argued Jan. 17, 2024) \n(presenting question “[w]hether the Court should overrule Chevron).  \n113.  Second, the Department’s reading of Title IX violates the principle that “[a]gencies \nare under an obligation to follow their own regulations, procedures, and precedents . . .” Utahns \nfor Better Transp. v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 305 F.3d 1152, 1165 (10th Cir. 2002), as modified on \n31 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 32 of 43\nreh'g, 319 F.3d 1207 (10th Cir. 2003) Here, the Department has chosen to leave the 1975 \nregulations — allowing sex-separated “toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” among other \nthings — on the books unchanged. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,819, 33,820 (discussing 34 \nC.F.R. §§ 106.33-.34). But these regulations expressly contemplate and permit schools’ dividing \ncertain  areas  based  on  students’  sex,  not  other  characteristics  like  gender  identity.  The \nDepartment’s gender-identity mandate thus conflicts with these regulations by rendering their core \nsex-based distinctions “meaningless.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 813.  \n114.  Because the Department’s interpretation of Title IX conflicts with the statutory text \nand operative regulations, it is not entitled to deference and exceeds the Department’s legal \nauthority to implement Title IX. The Final Rule therefore should be declared unlawful, “set aside,” \nand vacated. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM II \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B) \nAgency Action Contrary to the U.S. Constitution \n \n115.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference. \n116.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); see also id. § 706(2)(A); \nSierra Club, 60 F.4th at 1021; Long Island Power Auth., 27 F.4th at 717. The Final Rule is \nunconstitutional — and thus violates the APA — in multiple ways.  \n117.  First, if Title IX means what the Department says in the Final Rule, then Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination transgresses the Spending Clause several times over. See U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n118.  “[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a \ncontract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.” \n32 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 33 of 43\nAdams, 57 F.4th at 815 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). That framework means that “if \nCongress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys [under its Spending Clause \nauthority], it must do so unambiguously.” Id. (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17); see Hernandez-\nCarrera v. Carlson, 547 F.3d 1237, 1250 (10th Cir. 2008). The Spending Clause “clear-statement \nrule”  applies  with  particular  force  when  a  federal-funding  condition  “encroache[s]  upon  a \ntraditional state power,” such as the regulation of education. SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng’rs, 531 U.S. 159, 173 (2001); see also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 564.  \n119.  All agree that Congress passed Title  IX  “pursuant to its authority under the \nSpending Clause.” Adams, 57 F.4th at 815. So, the Department can enforce the Final Rule’s \nreading of Title IX against the States only if that reading is unambiguously directed by Title IX’s \ntext. Id. at 815-16. As the Eleventh Circuit correctly held in Adams, the Department’s position \ndoes not clear that high hurdle. Id. at 816. At best, the text is ambiguous, and ambiguous statutes \ncannot support new duties on the part of Spending Clause recipients. Id. at 815–16; accord Yellen, \n54 F.4th at 354 (“Congress itself must have spoken with a ‘clear voice’” to satisfy the Spending \nClause’s clear-statement rule (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17)). \n120.  The Final Rule also runs afoul of other Spending Clause limits. To start, given that \nPlaintiff Oklahoma’s non-compliance threatens immense sums in federal monies distributed to \nState educational institutions — including some hundreds of millions to Oklahoma alone — the \nRule unconstitutionally leaves Plaintiff Oklahoma with “no real option but to acquiesce” to the \nDepartment’s interpretation, Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577–78, 580–\n82 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J., joined by Breyer & Kagan, JJ.). In addition, the Final Rule \nimpermissibly conditions federal funding on States’ and school recipients’ taking unconstitutional \nactions against faculty and students for engaging in protected expression. See South Dakota v. \n33 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 34 of 43\nDole, 483 U.S. 203, 210–11 (1987). Finally, extending Title IX’s protections to individuals based \non gender identity alone is not related, as it must be, to the statute’s purpose of remedying past \ndiscrimination against women and promoting equal opportunity for women in education. See South \nDakota, 483 U.S. at 207–08. For these additional reasons, the Final Rule unlawfully exceeds \nCongress’s Spending-Clause power.  \n121.  Second,  to  the  extent  the  Department  asserts  authority  to  define  new \n“discriminatory practices” that violate Title IX exclusively “through [its] regulations,” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,517, 33,560, that position would transgress “the Constitution’s rule vesting federal \nlegislative  power  in  Congress,”  not  agencies  acting  by  “pen-and-phone  regulations.”  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. 737, 753 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Reading “sex” as a term capacious enough \nto  encompass  a  controversial  gender-identity  mandate,  among  other  novelties,  would  shift \n“unfettered” lawmaking power to the Department in a manner the nondelegation doctrine does not \ntolerate. See Bridge on behalf of Bridge v. Okla. State Dep't of Educ., No. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 \nWL 150598, at *8 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2024) (“At the time Title IX was enacted, the ordinary \npublic meaning of “sex” was understood to mean the biological, anatomical, and reproductive \ndifferences between male and female. It is up to Congress to change that meaning, not this \nCourt.”); see also Tiger Lily, LLC v. U. S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 672 (6th Cir. \n2021). \n122.  Third, the Final Rule violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. See U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV.  \n123.  To the extent the Biden Administration acts consistently with prior enforcement \npractice and interprets the Final Rule to compel school administrators and faculty to use gender-\nidentity-based pronouns for a student, the Final Rule would violate the First Amendment. Cf. \n34 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 35 of 43\nDavis, 526 U.S. at 642–43, 650 (recognizing that a school’s Title IX liability extends to sexual \nharassment of a student by teachers and peers). The First Amendment protects at least the rights \nof professors at public universities to decline to use pronouns inconsistent with the student’s sex \nwhen teaching. See Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 498–500, 505. And disciplining a professor or other \nmember of an educational community for failing to follow a school pronoun policy can violate the \nFree Exercise Clause. Id. at 512, 514. Either way, such an interpretation of the Final Rule would \nflout the First Amendment. \n124.  The Final Rule’s expansive definition of “hostile environment harassment” creates \nfurther First Amendment problems. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,493, 33,884. Under the Final Rule, this \nconcept covers all expression — even personal speech made in online forums off campus — that \nmight “reasonably” be deemed “unwelcome” and that is so “severe” as to “limit” students’ \neducational participation based on their sex. Id. at 33,535, 33,562, 33,884 (amending 34 C.F.R. § \n106.02). But the Department then defines sex-based harassment to include harassment based on \ncharacteristics extending far beyond sex, including various “sex characteristics” and “gender \nidentity.” Id. at 33,756, 33,886 (34 C.F.R. §§ 106.02, .10). This broad framework inhibits First \nAmendment rights by chilling, or risking liability over, students’ expression on deeply held views \nregarding significant moral and political issues. \n125.  Additionally,  by  requiring  school  administrators  to  “respond  promptly  and \neffectively” to accommodate a student’s stated gender identity, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,533, 33,888 \n(amending  §  106.444(a)),  the  Final  Rule  trespasses  on  the  “substantive  and  procedural \nprotection[s]” our Constitution extends to cover the right of parents to “[]bring [up]” their children \nas they deem fit. Smith v. Org. of Foster Fams. for Equal. & Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 842 (1977); \nM.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)). The \n35 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 36 of 43\nFinal Rule’s statement that schools should defer to parental wishes about whether “to make a \ncomplaint” about or how “to address” sex discrimination is no answer. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821-22. \nThat language does not purport to excuse schools from following the Final Rule’s directive that \nsex discrimination encompasses gender-identity preferences, or otherwise state that parental \nopposition requires excepting students from Title IX’s new reach.  \n126.  Because the Final Rule is unconstitutional in the ways discussed above, it should \nbe declared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM III \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n \n127.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference.  \n128.  Federal law prohibits agency actions, findings, and conclusions that are “arbitrary, \ncapricious,” or “an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n129.  A federal agency acts in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it (1) “has \nrelied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider”; (2) “entirely fail[s] to consider \nan important aspect of the [regulatory] problem”; (3) “offer[s] an explanation for” its conduct “that \nruns counter to the evidence before” it; or (4) reaches a determination that “is so implausible … it \ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or … agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n \nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n130.  At least one court has noted the “usual 90 day” time period for comment once the \nproposed rule is published in the Federal Register. See Prometheus Radio Project v. F.C.C., 652 \nF.3d 431, 453 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the Department of Education denied requests for extensions \nand provided only thirty-two (32) days for comment. In adopting the Final Rule over commenters’ \n36 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 37 of 43\nwidespread opposition and decades of contrary practice, the Department has acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously.  \n131.  First, the Department fails to offer a “reasoned explanation” for the Final Rule’s \ndeparture from the historic understanding of the meaning of Title IX’s prohibition on “sex” \ndiscrimination, which regulations have codified since 1975. Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016). The Final Rule retreats from the reality-blinking statement that the \nDepartment “does not have a ‘long-standing construction’ of the term ‘sex’ in Title IX to mean \n‘biological sex.’” 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,537. Instead, citing Bostock, the Final Rule claims that the \nDepartment’s interpretation is entirely consistent with reading “sex” to mean “biological sex.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,802, 33,805. 251.  \n132.  Bostock, though, disclaimed that its reasoning “address[ed] bathrooms, locker \nrooms … or anything else of the kind.” Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 817 (quoting Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 681). As the Sixth Circuit has held, and also recognized by Oklahoma courts, “the rule in \nBostock extends no further than Title VII.” Pelcha v. MW Bancorp., Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th \nCir. 2021); see also Bridge v. Okla. State Dep’t of Educ., No. CIV-22-00787-JD, 2024 WL 150598, \nat *6, n.1 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 12, 2024) (The Supreme Court made clear that its opinion did “not \npurport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”); Poe v. Drummond, \nNo. 23-CV-177-JFH-SH, 2023 WL 6516449, at *6 (N.D. Okla. Oct. 5, 2023). By definition, \nBostock  cannot  excuse  the  inconsistency  between  the  Department’s  longstanding  view  that \nenforcing sex-separation in spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities is not sex \ndiscrimination, on the one hand, and its new rule deeming such policies actionable Title IX \ndiscrimination, on the other.  \n37 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 38 of 43\n133.  Such “[u]nexplained inconsistency in agency policy is a reason for holding [the \nDepartment’s] interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change.” Encino Motorcars, 579 \nU.S. at 222 (cleaned up). Indeed, the Department’s internally conflicting analysis suggests that the \nFinal Rule’s Bostock-based justifications for redrawing Title IX reflect “contrived reasons” offered \nto support a predetermined result: Effectuating President Biden’s day-one directive to find new \nfederal authority for adopting “prohibitions on sex discrimination on the basis of gender identity \nor sexual orientation.” Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. at 7,023 (capitalization altered); \nDep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019).  \n134.  Second  and  relatedly,  the  Department  fails  to  “engage  in  ‘reasoned \ndecisionmaking.’” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015) (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & \nServ., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)). This APA requirement means agencies cannot rest \non “statements contradict[ing] earlier responses.” Del. Dep’t of Nat. Res. & Envtl. Control v. EPA, \n785 F.3d 1, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  \n135.  Yet  the Department’s  stated  reasoning  offers  “self-contradictory  …  logic” in \nspades. Id. at 16 (citation omitted). The Department points to Congress’s allowing sex-separation \nin “living facilities” and 20 U.S.C. § 1681(1)-(9)’s exceptions as justification for omitting such \nfacilities and programs from its gender-identity mandate. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816, 33,818-19. But \nthe Department arbitrarily declines to extend the same treatment to bathrooms, toilets, and \nshowers,  which  its  regulations  likewise permit  to  be separated  based  on  sex.  Nor  can  the \nDepartment identify a rational basis for allowing school activities and programs associated with \nGirls and Boys State to restrict participation based on sex, see § 1686(a)(7), yet requiring the \nparticipation of boys identifying as girls in sex-ed classes for girls. Nor can it explain why its \n“longstanding athletics regulations” support continuing to allow some (unspecified) enforcement \n38 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 39 of 43\nof sex-separate sports, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817, but the equally longstanding regulations governing \nbathrooms and locker rooms do not. Nor can the Department defend its assertion that consistently \nenforcing sex-separation policies based on persons’ “physical differences” violates Title IX, since \nsuch differences underlie Title IX’s entire statutory and regulatory scheme. Id. at 33,819. \n136.  Third, the Department failed to adequately “consider and respond to significant \ncomments received during the period for public comment” on the Final Rule. Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers  Ass’n,  575  U.S.  92,  96  (2015).  Commenters  raised  a  raft  of  concerns  about  the \nconstitutional defects and compliance challenges attending the Final Rule’s approach. But in \nresponse to many, the Final Rule offers only a “handful of conclusory sentences” and “unexplained \ninconsistencies.” Gresham v. Azar, 950 F.3d 93, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2020), vacated as moot, 142 S. Ct. \n1665 (Mem.) (2022); Dist. Hosp. Partners, L.P. v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 46, 59 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \n“Nodding to concerns raised by commenters only to dismiss them in a conclusory manner is not \nthe hallmark of reasoned decisionmaking.” Gresham, 950 F.3d at 103.  \n137.  Examples of the Department’s flawed approach abound. The Final Rule claims \n“nothing in the[] regulations” conflicts with the First Amendment. E.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,500, \n33,507, 33,535, 33,819. Yet it relies on Title VII EEOC harassment guidance that implicates \nfreespeech rights on its face. The Final Rule defers consideration of constitutional concerns to \nfuture “technical assistance” documents, id. at 33,822, and enforcement actions, id. at 33,512, \nsaying it can only address “specific examples” with future facts, id. at 33,509, 33,512. Yet \nelsewhere the Final Rule references examples provided for “illustrative purposes.” Id. Regardless, \npromising to address future chaos does not adequately address the Final Rule’s present legal \nproblems. See Bloomberg L.P. v. SEC, 45 F.4th 462, 476–77 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  \n39 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 40 of 43\n138.  Fourth, the Department “entirely fail[s] to consider [certain] important aspect[s] of \nthe problem” or address relevant evidence that “runs counter” to its cost-benefit determination. \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. The Department altogether ignores States’ practical concerns about \nauthenticating gender identity, and likewise sidesteps commenters’ objections that the Final Rule \nendangers privacy and safety interests. The Department rejects the view that the Final Rule will \n“lessen[]  the  force  of  Title  IX’s  protections  against  discrimination  that  limits  educational \nopportunities for girls and women,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,808, ignoring the evidence that men \nidentifying as women have already taken such opportunities from women. The Department fails \nto consider evidence of the biological differences between men and women that have long justified \nsex-separated  facilities,  certain  sex-separated  classes,  and  sex-separated  sports.  And  the \nDepartment downplays the grave compliance challenges with structuring school operations based \non internal notions of gender identity that are subjective and subject to change.  \n139.  For any and all of the preceding reasons, the Secretary’s promulgation of the Final \nRule was “arbitrary [and] capricious” and an “abuse of [agency] discretion,” and the Rule should \ntherefore be declared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM IV \nRelief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 5 U.S.C. § 706 \nClaim for Declaratory Judgment Against Defendants \n \n140.  All allegations above are incorporated herein by reference.  \n141.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that “[i]n a case of actual controversy \nwithin its jurisdiction … any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, \nmay declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.” \n28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  \n40 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 41 of 43\n142.  This case presents an actual controversy. The Final Rule operates on recipients of \nTitle IX funds directly, meaning its requirements affect their legal rights. Moreover, the imminent \nenforcement of the Department’s Final Rule threatens to force state recipients of Title IX funding \nto choose between violating Plaintiff’s laws and abandoning consistent policies or losing its Title \nIX funding — funding that amounts to many millions annually.  \n143.  The controversy involves questions of federal law and thus arises in this Court’s \njurisdiction. Venue is proper, as the State of Oklahoma resides in this District. \n144.  Through this Complaint, Plaintiff Oklahoma has filed an appropriate pleading to \nhave its rights declared. The Court can resolve this controversy by declaring that  Plaintiff \nOklahoma has a right to Title IX funding notwithstanding state policies and legal directives that \nstudents participate in covered education programs and activities based on their sex, not gender \nidentity. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n145.  An actual controversy exists between the Parties that entitle Plaintiff Oklahoma to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. This Court is authorized to award the requested vacatur and \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, and 706; 28 U.S.C. § 1361; \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202; Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure; and the general and legal equitable powers of the Court. For these reasons, \nPlaintiff Oklahoma respectfully requests that the Court:  \na.  Enter a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5  U.S.C. § 705 and  a \npreliminary injunction enjoining Defendants, and any other agency or employee of \nthe United States, from enforcing or implementing the portions of the Final Rule \nthat violate Title IX, the APA, and the U.S. Constitution;  \n41 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00461-HE   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 42 of 43\nb.  Enter a judgment declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 5 U.S.C. § 706, that \n(i) the Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX is unlawful; (ii) that the Final Rule is \narbitrary and capricious; and (iii) that the Plaintiff, its political subdivisions, and its \nresident institutions may continue receiving Title IX funding notwithstanding any \nfailure to adhere to the Final Rule’s unlawful requirements;  \nc.  Set aside and vacate the Final Rule on the basis that it violates Title IX, the APA, \nand the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706; \nd.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from withholding Title IX funding from Plaintiff, \nits political subdivisions, and resident institutions for refusing to comply with the \nFinal Rule’s unlawful requirements; and  \ne.  Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \n \nDated May 6, 2024.           Respectfully submitted,  \n \n            s/ Barry G.
