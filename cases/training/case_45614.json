    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Biden administration&rsquo;s 2024 Title IX Rule, which broadened the interpretation of &ldquo;sex discrimination&rdquo; to include protections for LGBTQ+ students, addressing discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity.</p>\r\n<p>On May 7, 2024, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and a 15-year-old female resident of Jonesboro, Arkansas, represented by her mother, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri - St. Louis Division against the U.S. Secretary of Education and the U.S. Department of Education, the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Education. The case was assigned to Judge Rodney W. Sippel.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief enjoining defendants and any other agency or employee of the United States from enforcing or implementing the portions of the Final Rule that violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551&ndash;559, and the federal Constitution. They also sought declaratory relief declaring that the Final Rule&rsquo;s interpretation of Title IX is unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious. Additionally, they sought a declaration that the plaintiff States will continue to receive funding and that the Final Rule&rsquo;s requirements will not be enforced against the plaintiff minor and other similarly situated individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Before this case started, on April 29, 2024, the Biden administration announced its final rule interpreting Title IX, to go into effect on August 1, 2024. Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024). The Rule gives LGBTQ+ students and others explicit protection from sex discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs based their claim on the grounds that the Rule exceeded statutory authority. They argued that the Department&rsquo;s redefinition of sex discrimination was unlawful because it contravened Title IX&rsquo;s text. Title IX&rsquo;s prohibition of discrimination &ldquo;on the basis of sex&rdquo; referred only to biological sex and did not include protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. By rewriting the statute to extend the scope to sexual orientation and gender identity, the Department has exceeded its authority under the APA. Plaintiffs also argued that the Final Rule interpretation of Title IX would require religious students &ndash;particularly Christians&ndash; to speak or use titles or pronouns in a manner that violates their beliefs, violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). They maintained that the Department had no compelling interest in requiring such speech.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs contended that the Rule violates the U.S. Constitution in three key ways: First, under the Spending Clause, they argued that any conditions on federal funding, like those in Title IX, must be expressed &ldquo;unambiguously&rdquo; by Congress, which the Rule failed to do; moreover, it coerced states into compliance with no viable alternative. Second, they invoked the Nondelegation and Major Questions Doctrines, asserting that the Department overstepped its authority by redefining &ldquo;sex&rdquo; under Title IX beyond its traditional, biological understanding without explicit congressional approval. Third, they argued that the Rule infringed upon the First Amendment by compelling students and school staff to use pronouns based on a student&rsquo;s gender identity rather than biological sex, violating individuals' rights to refrain from using pronouns inconsistent with sex.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed to offer a reasonable explanation for the Final Rule&rsquo;s departure from the historical understanding&mdash;including within previous Title IX regulations&mdash;of Title IX&rsquo;s prohibition on &ldquo;sex&rdquo; discrimination. At the same time, the Department failed to adequately &ldquo;consider and respond to significant comments received during the period for public comment&rdquo; on the Final Rule. Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass&rsquo;n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 2024, the court granted the preliminary injunction petitioned with the complaint based on three factors. First, the plaintiffs demonstrated a likely success on the merits by showing a fair chance of prevailing on the argument that the Department exceeded its statutory authority by expanding definitions under Title IX. Second, irreparable harm was established, as the Final Rule would prevent states from enforcing their own laws, and plaintiff A.F. faced potential violations of privacy and First Amendment rights. Finally, the balance of equities favored the plaintiffs, as their interest in protecting constitutional rights outweighed any harm to the Department from temporarily halting an allegedly unlawful rule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 15, 2024, the court granted the joint motion to stay proceedings pending defendant&rsquo;s appeal of the preliminary injunction before the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals (Arkansas v. Cardona, 24-2921 (8th Cir.)). The case is still ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

ECF 9.  Defendants have filed an opposition to the motion, \nECF 18, and plaintiffs have filed a reply brief in support of the motion.  ECF 21.  \nAmicus briefs were also filed in support of defendants’ opposition to the motion.  \nECF 34, 43.   The Court also ordered the parties to submit additional briefing and \nproposed orders for the Court’s consideration, which appear in the record as ECF \n39, 41, 47, 48, 49, 50.  The issues have been fully briefed.  Neither side requested \nan evidentiary hearing.  Therefore, the matter is ripe for resolution. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 2 of 56 PageID #:\n1253\n \nBackground \n  Plaintiffs are six states1 and one individual minor resident of Arkansas \n(A.F.).  Defendants are the United States Department of Education (Department), \nMiguel Cardona (the Secretary of Education), Catherine Lhamon (the Assistant \nSecretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education), and Randolph Willis \n(the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement at the Department of Education) \n(collectively, the Department).2  The Department is charged with issuing rules \neffectuating Title IX.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Title IX prohibits recipients of federal \nfunds from discriminating on the basis of sex in their education programs or \nactivities.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  On April 29, 2024, the Department issued a rule \ntitled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance,” 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (the \nFinal Rule or Rule).  ECF 9-1.  The Rule takes effect August 1, 2024.  \n  As is relevant here, the Rule states that “discrimination on the basis of sex” \nincludes “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,886, and that the definition of hostile environment sex-based harassment \nincludes “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the \n \n1 Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. \n \n2 The individual defendants are named in their official capacities only. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 3 of 56 PageID #:\n1254\n \ncircumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or \npervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from \nthe recipient’s education program or activity.”  Id. at 33,884. \n  In the motion before the Court, plaintiffs seek to stay or preliminarily enjoin \nthe Rule’s effective date and prevent defendants from enforcing it pending the \nresolution of the underlying dispute.  Plaintiffs assert that the Rule violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is contrary to law, exceeds the \nDepartment’s statutory authority, and is arbitrary and capricious because “it \nrequires States, schools, and universities to ignore biological sex in favor of self-\nprofessed ‘gender identity’ when it comes to bathrooms, locker rooms, athletics, \nand even speech.”  ECF 12 at 3.  Plaintiffs also contend that the Rule \nimpermissibly expands the definition of sex-based harassment and contravenes \ncontrolling United States Supreme Court precedent, Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of \nEduc., 526 U.S. 629 (1999).   \n  Plaintiff States all receive federal funding for their schools and as a result are \nrequired to comply with the Final Rule. A failure to comply with Title IX may \nresult in termination of federal funding.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Plaintiff States assert \nthat the Final Rule conflicts with laws passed in their states. \n  Defendants respond that the Department’s interpretation of discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” in the Rule straightforwardly applies the Supreme Court’s \n3 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 4 of 56 PageID #:\n1255\n \nreasoning in the Title VII case, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), to \nTitle IX.  Defendants contend that the Rule also appropriately recognizes \ndistinctions between contexts in which Congress has specified exceptions to Title \nIX’s prohibition on sex discrimination, and other contexts, “such as restrooms, ” in \nwhich it has not.  ECF 18 at 10.  According to the defendants, the Rule permissibly \nexplains that outside specified statutorily-mandated exceptions, separate or \ndifferent treatment based on sex constitutes unlawful discrimination under Title IX \nonly if it causes more than de minimis harm.  Defendants further contend that the \ndefinition of sex-based harassment is consistent with Title IX, the Department’s \nenforcement authority, and prior standards of enforcement.  Defendants deny that \nthe Rule’s definition of sex-based harassment conflicts with any governing legal \nprecedent or the First Amendment, or that it is otherwise arbitrary or capricious. \nStanding \n  Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \n“Cases” and “Controversies.”  Murthy v. Missouri, -- S. Ct. --, 2024 WL 3165801, \nat *7 (U.S. June 26, 2024).  The “case or controversy” requirement is “fundamental \nto the judiciary’s proper role in our system of government.”  Raines v. Byrd, 521 \nU.S. 811, 818 (1997) (cleaned up).  Federal courts can only review statutes and \nexecutive actions when necessary “to redress or prevent actual or imminently \nthreatened injury to persons caused by official violation of law.”  Summers v. Earth \n4 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 5 of 56 PageID #:\n1256\n \nIsland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009) (cleaned up).  “If a dispute is not a \nproper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding \nthe law in the course of doing so.”  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, \n341 (2006). \n  A proper case or controversy exists only when at least one plaintiff \nestablishes that it has standing to sue.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 818.  That plaintiff must \nshow that it has suffered, or will suffer, an injury that is “concrete, particularized, \nand actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable \nby a favorable ruling.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) \n(cleaned up).  The plaintiff “bears the burden of establishing standing as of the \ntime it brought the lawsuit and maintaining it thereafter.”  Carney v. Adams, 592 \nU.S. 53, 59 (2020) (cleaned up).  It must support each element of standing “with \nthe manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the \nlitigation.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  At the \npreliminary injunction stage, then, the plaintiff must make a “clear showing” that it \nis “likely” to establish each element of standing.  See Winter v. Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (cleaned up).  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 6 of 56 PageID #:\n1257\n \n  Plaintiffs have established standing with respect to their claims.  As \nrecipients of Title IX funds who will be required to comply with the Final Rule3 or \nface loss of funding, plaintiff States have sufficiently alleged that the Final Rule \nwill cause concrete, imminent injury redressable by the requested injunctive relief.  \n“Government regulations that require or forbid some action by the plaintiff almost \ninvariably satisfy both the injury in fact and causation requirements.”  Food & \nDrug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 382 (2024). Moreover, \n“when a statute is challenged by a party who is a target or object of the statute’s \nprohibitions, there is ordinarily little question that the [statute] has caused him \ninjury.”  St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce v. Gaertner, 439 F.3d 481, 485 (8th \nCir. 2006) (cleaned up).    \n  Plaintiff States further allege that the Final Rule interferes with their \nsovereign right to create and enforce their own laws, imposes administrative costs \nand burdens, and requires plaintiff States to redesign or reconfigure their physical \nfacilities.  ECF 1 at 31-42.  States have an interest in “the exercise of sovereign \npower over individuals and entities within the relevant jurisdiction—this involves \nthe power to create and enforce a legal code, both civil and criminal.”  Texas v. \n \n3 New duties are additionally imposed under the Final Rule that were not required under the prior \nregulations, such as hiring Title IX coordinators, to make sure the Final Rule’s new policies are \ncarried out, which is sufficient to demonstrate injury for standing purposes.  See Kansas v. Dept. \nof Educ., 2024 WL 3273285, at *7 (D. Kan. July 2, 2024). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 7 of 56 PageID #:\n1258\n \nCardona, No. 4:23-CV-00604-O, 2024 WL 2947022, at *11 (N.D. Tex. June 11, \n2024) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982)).  Plaintiffs contend that the Department seeks to regulate Title IX \nin a manner that is not compatible with their state laws.  See e.g., Ark. Code Ann. § \n6-10-137(a) (requiring that overnight accommodations on school travel be \nseparated by sex of the student); Ark. Code. Ann. § 6-21-120(b)(1) (requiring that \nschools designate multiple occupancy restrooms based on biological sex): Iowa \nCode § 280.33(2) (multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms must \ncorrespond to the student’s sex); Neb. Rev. Stat. § 79-2,124 (separating toilet \nfacilities, locker rooms, or living facilities by sex); N.D.C.C. § 15-10-68(1)-(2) \n(dormitory restrooms and showers must be designated exclusively for males or \nfemales and may only be used by members of that sex). \n  Further, plaintiff States have standing due to the alleged injuries to their state \nuniversities.  See Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370, 371 (1953); Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2367-68 (2023).  They are also threatened with a loss \nof federal funding if they fail to comply with the Final Rule.  See Tennessee v. \nDept. of Educ., 104 F.4th 577, 589 (6th Cir. 2024); Kansas v. Dept. of Educ., 2024 \nWL 3273285, at *7 (D. Kan. July 2, 2024).  The States have further sufficiently \nalleged that their injury is traceable to defendants and redressable by a favorable \nruling. See id.; Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *18–19. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 8 of 56 PageID #:\n1259\n \n  Defendants do not contest that plaintiff States have adequately alleged \nstanding.  ECF 47, 50 at 15. \n  Plaintiff A.F. avers by declaration that her religious beliefs are that: there are \ntwo sexes; a person’s sex cannot be changed;  and, she believes that she must use \npronouns which align with a person’s biological sex.  ECF 9-3 at 7.  A.F. has \nespoused these views at her school.  Id.  In light of the Final Rule, however, A.F. is \nfearful that she would be subject to investigation and potential discipline for \ncontinuing to speak her views.  Id. at 8.  A.F. also states that if she were forced to \nuse restroom, locker room, or shower facilities with biological males, she would be \ndeeply distressed, embarrassed, anxious, and would avoid these areas.  Id. at 8-9.  \nBased on these allegations in combination with her particularized and concrete \nallegations of potential imminent harm if she is required to share restrooms, locker \nrooms or shower facilities with biological males, the court finds that A.F. has \nstanding to challenge the Final Rule.  See Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *7. \nStandards Governing the Issuance of Preliminary Relief \n  Section 705 of the APA provides that when a plaintiff shows that a stay or \npreliminary injunction would be necessary to prevent irreparable injury, the Court \n“may issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of \nan agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review \nproceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705. The Court’s power under Section 705 to issue a stay \n8 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 9 of 56 PageID #:\n1260\n \non agency action is limited “to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury.”  \nId. (cleaned up). \n  The Court has discretion to issue a stay and considers four factors: “(1) \nwhether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed \non the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; \n(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 434 (2009) (cleaned up).  The mere possibility of irreparable injury is not \nsufficient.  Id. at 434–35.  When the government opposes the stay, the final two \nfactors merge into an assessment of the public interest.  Id. at 435. \n  Besides its authority to issue a stay under the APA, the Court may \nalternatively issue a preliminary injunction under traditional equitable principles. \nThis Court has broad discretion when ruling on preliminary injunctions.  Lankford \nv. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 503 (8th Cir. 2006).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish four factors showing such relief is warranted: (1) he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) \nan injunction is in the public interest.”  MPAY Inc. v. Erie Custom Comput. \nApplications, Inc., 970 F.3d 1010, 1015 (8th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up).  When \ndeciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, courts ask “whether the balance \n9 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 10 of 56 PageID #:\n1261\n \nof equities so favors the movant that justice requires the court to intervene to \npreserve the status quo until the merits are determined.”  Nebraska v. Biden, 52 \nF.4th 1044, 1046 (8th Cir. 2022) (cleaned up).  The movant bears the burden of \ndemonstrating the preliminary injunction is warranted because a preliminary \ninjunction is an “extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Progressive \nTechs., Inc. v. Chaffin Holdings, Inc., 33 F.4th 481, 485 (8th Cir. 2022) (cleaned \nup).   \nLegislative History of Title IX and its Regulations \n  Title IX was enacted on June 23, 1972.  See Tennessee v. Cardona, 2024 \nWL 3019146, at *2 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024) (discussing the history of Title IX).  \nTitle IX was “patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  Cannon v. \nUniv. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 684–85 (1979).  When the provisions were \nintroduced in the Senate for debate, Senator Bayh commented that the “heart of \nthis amendment is a provision banning sex discrimination in educational programs \nreceiving Federal funds. The amendment would cover such crucial aspects as \nadmissions procedures, scholarships, and faculty employment.” N. Haven Bd. of \nEd. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 524 (1982) (quoting 118 Cong. Rec. 5,803 (1972)).  He \nstressed that “one of the great failings of the American educational system is the \ncontinuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination against women.”  118 \n10 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 11 of 56 PageID #:\n1262\n \nCong. Rec. at 5,803.  He urged the passage of the amendment to “root out. . . the \nsocial evil of sex discrimination in education.”  Id. at 5,804.  \n  The United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \npromulgated final regulations in 1975 concerning Title IX.  North Haven Bd. of \nEduc. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 515-16 (1982).  The Title IX regulations included \nregulations in the area of athletics.  High schools and colleges were given three \nyears to comply with the regulation on athletics which required equal opportunities \nfor “members of both sexes” to participate in athletics.  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c), (d).  \nThe regulations also provided that a recipient “may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for \nstudents of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of \nthe other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n  Amendments to the regulations became effective on November 24, 2006, to \n“clarify and modify Title IX regulatory requirements pertaining to the provision of \nsingle-sex schools, classes, and extracurricular activities in elementary and \nsecondary schools.”  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 71 Fed. Reg. \n62530-01 (Oct. 25, 2006) (codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.34).  \n  The regulations were amended again in 2020.  These amendments addressed \nsex-based harassment as a form of sex discrimination, a recipient’s obligation to \n11 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 12 of 56 PageID #:\n1263\n \naddress sexual harassment, grievance procedures, and implemented remedies for \nvictims.  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30026-01 (May \n19, 2020) (codified in Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations).  This was the \nfirst time that the regulations addressed sexual harassment and included a \ndefinition for that term.  § 106.30.  In relevant part, Section 106.30 defines “sexual \nharassment” as “conduct on the basis of sex” that is “[u]nwelcome conduct \ndetermined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education \nprogram or activity.” (emphasis added.) \n  After the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Bostock, the Department \nissued a memorandum regarding Bostock stating that the decision did not “construe \nTitle IX,” and that the “Title IX text is very different from Title VII text in many \nimportant respects,” including that Title IX “contains numerous exceptions \nauthorizing or allowing sex-separate activities and intimate facilities to be provided \nseparately on the basis of biological sex or for members of each biological sex.”  \nSee Tennessee v. Dept. of Educ., 104 F.4th at 585-86 (quoting the January 8, 2021, \nmemorandum).  That memorandum was later rescinded.  Id. \n  Following a change in administration, on March 8, 2021, President Biden \nissued an executive order tasking the Secretary of Education to review all existing \n12 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 13 of 56 PageID #:\n1264\n \nregulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and other similar agency actions \nto determine whether they were inconsistent with the Administration’s policy that \nall students be guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on \nthe basis of sex and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  See Exec. Order No. 14,021, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803 (Mar. 8, 2021).  \n  On June 22, 2021, the Department published its interpretation of Title IX in \nthe Federal Register.  Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender \nIdentity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, \n2021).   This document is preliminarily enjoined from being applied to several \nStates, including plaintiffs Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota.  \nTennessee v. Dept. of Educ., 104 F.4th at 586.  In addition, the Department is now \npermanently enjoined from enforcing it.  Texas v. Cardona, 4:23CV604O, 2024 \nWL 2947022, at *51 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2024) \n  On July 12, 2022, the Department published the Final Rule in the Federal \nRegister and received more than 240,000 comments on the proposed regulations.  \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33477 (Apr. 29, \n2024).  The Final Rule slightly modified some of the proposed regulations based \non the comments.  It is scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2024.  According to \n13 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 14 of 56 PageID #:\n1265\n \nthe Final Rule, the Department amended the regulations to “better align the Title \nIX regulatory requirements with Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,474.  \nFinal Rule \n  Plaintiffs challenge the following provisions of the Rule.  First, the Rule \ndefines Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to include “discrimination on \nthe basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to \nbe codified at 34 C.F.R. 106.10).  The Department explains that “discrimination on \neach of those bases is sex discrimination because each necessarily involves \nconsideration of a person’s sex, even if that term is understood to mean only \nphysiological or ‘biological distinctions between male and female.’”  Id. at 33,802 \n(quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655); see generally 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,801–10 \n(explaining the bases for § 106.10 and Bostock’s application).  \n  To implement this definition of sex discrimination, the Department instructs \nthat schools are permitted to maintain certain sex-segregated programs, activities, \nand facilities.  Id. at 33,814.  (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  The Rule \nprovides that—except in circumstances where Congress provided otherwise—Title \nIX prohibits “distinctions or differences in treatment [on the basis of sex] that \ninjure protected individuals.” Id. at 33,814 (brackets in original) (quoting Bostock, \n14 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 15 of 56 PageID #:\n1266\n \n590 U.S. at 681).  The Rule provides that a recipient must not provide sex-separate \nfacilities or activities in a manner that subjects any person to “more than de \nminimis harm.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,814.  The Department recognizes that sex \n“separation in certain circumstances, including in the context of bathrooms or \nlocker rooms, is not presumptively unlawful sex discrimination” because \nseparation of such facilities by sex generally imposes no more than de minimis \nharm on students.  Id. at 33,818; see generally 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  However, the \nDepartment explains that sex separation that prevents a person from participating \nin an education program or activity consistent with their gender identity does cause \nmore than de minimis harm and is therefore prohibited by Title IX.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,814-16, 33,819 n.90. \n  Because Congress did not include same sex bathrooms or locker rooms in \nthe statutory exceptions of Title IX in which different or separate treatment based \non sex is permitted, see, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) (membership practices of \ncertain social fraternities or sororities); id. § 1681(a)(4) (institutions focused on \nmilitary training); id. § 1686 (educational institution’s maintenance of “separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes”), the Department concludes that denial of a \ntransgender student access to a sex-separate bathroom or locker room consistent \nwith that student’s gender identity violates Title IX.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818-19.   \n15 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 16 of 56 PageID #:\n1267\n \n  The term “gender identity” is not defined in the new regulations, but the \nterm is understood as “an individual’s sense of their gender, which may or may not \nbe different from their sex assigned at birth.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809.  The Rule \ndoes not specify how a school should determine a student’s gender identity.  Id. at \n33,819.  The Rule permits a school to rely on a student’s “consistent assertion to \ndetermine their gender identity, or on written confirmation of the student’s gender \nidentity by the student or student’s parent, counselor, coach or teacher.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,819.  However, the Rule states that “requiring a student to submit to \ninvasive medical inquiries or burdensome documentation requirements to \nparticipate in a recipient’s education program or activity consistent with their \ngender identity imposes more than de minimis harm.”  Id. \n  The Rule preempts all “State or local laws or other requirements” that \nconflict with its terms, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885, and it applies to any school \n“program or activity” regardless of whether the activity occurs within the school.  \nId. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. 106.11).   \n  The Rule does not apply to sex-separate athletic teams permitted under \n§106.41(b), as that regulation is carved out in § 106.31(a)(2).  Fed. Reg. at 33,819.  \nHowever, it would apply to bathrooms and shower facilities, which are used in \nconnection with athletics.  Id.  Further, it would also apply to single-sex classes or \n16 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 17 of 56 PageID #:\n1268\n \nportions of classes, such as physical education, that are allowed under the current \nregulations.  Id. \n  The Rule redefines the term “sexual harassment” previously used in the \nregulations as “sex-based harassment,” which means “sexual harassment and other \nharassment on the basis of sex, including on the bases described in [34 C.F.R.] § \n106.10 . . . .”  34 C.F.R. 106.2 (effective Aug. 1, 2024).  The Rule also redefines \nhostile environment sex-based harassment as “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct \nthat, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively \noffensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to \nparticipate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,884 (emphasis added).  The Rule states that “sex-based harassment, \nincluding harassment predicated on sex stereotyping or gender identity, is covered \nby Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, subjectively and objectively offensive, \nand sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny a student’s ability to \nparticipate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or activity (i.e., \ncreates a hostile environment). Thus, harassing a student—including acts of verbal, \nnonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on the student’s \nnonconformity with stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity or gender \nidentity—can constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX in certain \ncircumstances.”  Id. at 33,516. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 18 of 56 PageID #:\n1269\n \n  The Rule does not limit harassment to speech that occurs on school \ncampuses and states that a recipient’s obligations under Title IX are triggered \nwhenever a school employee “has information about conduct among students that \ntook place on social media or other platforms that reasonably may have created a \nsex-based hostile environment in the recipient's education program or activity.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 33535. \n  The Rule also changes the grievance procedures for complaints of sex \ndiscrimination.  89 Fed.

City of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979).  The \nstatute was modeled after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see id. at \n694–696; Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 566 (1984), which is \nparallel to Title IX except that it prohibits race discrimination, not sex \ndiscrimination, and applies in all programs receiving federal funds, not only \nin education programs.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.  The two statutes \noperate in the same manner, conditioning an offer of federal funding on a \npromise by the recipient not to discriminate, in what amounts essentially to a \ncontract between the Government and the recipient of funds.  See Guardians \nAss’n v. Civil Service Com’n of City of New York, 463 U.S. 582, 599 (1983) \n(opinion of White, J.); id., at 609 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); cf. \nPennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17  (1981). \n \nThat contractual framework distinguishes Title IX from Title VII, which is \nframed in terms not of a condition but of an outright prohibition.  Title VII \napplies to all employers without regard to federal funding and aims broadly \nto “eradicat[e] discrimination throughout the economy.”  Landgraf v. USI \nFilm Products, 511 U.S. 244, 254 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nTitle VII, moreover, seeks to “make persons whole for injuries suffered \nthrough past discrimination.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThus, whereas Title VII aims centrally to compensate victims of \ndiscrimination, Title IX focuses more on “protecting” individuals from \ndiscriminatory practices carried out by recipients of federal funds.

Scope of review \n \nTo the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court \nshall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and \nstatutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms \nof an agency action. The reviewing court shall— \n \n(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and \n \n(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions \nfound to be— \n \n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law; \n \n(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; \n \n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right; \n \n(D) without observance of procedure required by law; \n \n(E) unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and \n557 of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing \nprovided by statute; or \n \n(F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de \nnovo by the reviewing court. \n \nIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole \nrecord or those parts of it cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of \nthe rule of prejudicial error. \n \n5 U.S.C. § 706. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 26 of 56 PageID #:\n1277\n \nThe Bostock and Davis decisions   \n  The parties disagree about whether and how to apply these two Supreme \nCourt decisions.  Plaintiffs contend that the Department’s decisions to apply \nBostock to Title IX and to expand the definition of sexual harassment beyond the \nlanguage of Davis are contrary to law and in excess of its statutory authority.  \nDefendants contend that its application of Bostock to Title IX is compelled by the \nplain language of the statute, and that Davis did not purport to define sexual \nharassment for purposes of administrative enforcement of Title IX. \n  In Bostock, 590 U.S. at 651–52, the Supreme Court held: \nAn employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender \nfires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in \nmembers of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in \nthe decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. \n \nId.  The Supreme Court defined its task as determining “the ordinary public \nmeaning of Title VII’s command that it is unlawful for an employer to fail or \nrefuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of \nemployment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national \norigin.”  Id. at 655 (cleaned up).  The Supreme Court acknowledged that “‘sex’ is \nthe primary term in Title VII whose meaning the parties dispute.”  Id. (cleaned up).  \nThe Supreme Court noted that the employers in the case used the term sex to “refer \nto ‘status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology,’ while \n26 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 27 of 56 PageID #:\n1278\n \nthe employees countered that the term bore a broader scope, capturing more than \nanatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual \norientation.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Ultimately, though, the Supreme Court found that \n“nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome of the parties’ debate, \nso we proceed on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, \nreferring only to biological distinctions between male and female.”  Id. (cleaned \nup).  As a result, the Court in Bostock concluded that “sex,” as used in Title VII, \nrefers to the “biological distinctions between male and female.”  Id. \n  The Supreme Court went on to state that was “just a starting point.  The \nquestion isn’t just what ‘sex’ meant, but what Title VII says about it.  Most \nnotably, the statute prohibits employers from taking certain actions ‘because of’ \nsex.  And, as this Court has previously explained, the ordinary meaning of \n‘because of’ is ‘by reason of’ or ‘on account of.’”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 \n(cleaned up).  Applying this test, the Supreme Court concluded that “an employer \nviolates Title VII when it intentionally fires an individual employee based in part \non sex.”  Id. at 659.  That is because “at bottom, these cases involve no more than \nthe straightforward application of legal terms with plain and settled meanings.  For \nan employer to discriminate against employees for being homosexual or \ntransgender, the employer must intentionally discriminate against individual men \nand women in part because of sex.  That has always been prohibited by Title VII’s \n27 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 28 of 56 PageID #:\n1279\n \nplain terms—and that should be the end of the analysis.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 662 \n(cleaned up). \n  The Supreme Court accepted the premise that “homosexuality and \ntransgender status are distinct concepts from sex,” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 669, but  \nnevertheless concluded that “discrimination based on homosexuality or \ntransgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot \nhappen without the second.”  Id.   \n  The Supreme Court rejected the idea of a “‘canon of donut holes,’ in which \nCongress’s failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more \ngeneral statutory rule creates a tacit exception.  Instead, when Congress chooses \nnot to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply the broad rule.”  Id.    \nAddressing the issue of statutory interpretation, the Supreme Court explained that \n“when the meaning of the statute’s terms is plain, our job is at an end.  The people \nare entitled to rely on the law as written, without fearing that courts might \ndisregard its plain terms based on some extratextual consideration. Of course, some \nMembers of this Court have consulted legislative history when interpreting \nambiguous statutory language. But that has no bearing here. Legislative history, for \nthose who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it.  And as \nwe have seen, no ambiguity exists about how Title VII’s terms apply to the facts \nbefore us.”   Bostock, 590 U.S. at 673–74 (cleaned up).   \n28 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 29 of 56 PageID #:\n1280\n \n  Addressing the application of Bostock to other statutes, the Supreme Court \nstated: \nThe employers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other \nfederal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination. And, under Title VII \nitself, they say sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes will \nprove unsustainable after our decision today. But none of these other laws \nare before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the \nmeaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today. \nUnder Title VII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, \nor anything else of the kind. The only question before us is whether an \nemployer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender \nhas discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual “because \nof such individual’s sex.” As used in Title VII, the term “‘discriminate \nagainst’” refers to “distinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.”  Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, \n548 U.S. 53, 59 (2006).  Firing employees because of a statutorily protected \ntrait surely counts. Whether other policies and practices might or might not \nqualify as unlawful discrimination or find justifications under other \nprovisions of Title VII are questions for future cases, not these. \n \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 681 (cleaned up). \n  Finally, the Supreme Court “emphatically rejected the view that, in the \ncontext of an unambiguous statutory text, whether a specific application was \nanticipated by Congress is irrelevant.”  Bostock 590 U.S. at 677 (cleaned up).  That \nis because “applying protective laws to groups that were politically unpopular at \nthe time of the law’s passage often may be seen as unexpected.  But to refuse \nenforcement just because of that, because the parties before us happened to be \nunpopular at the time of the law’s passage, would not only require us to abandon \nour role as interpreters of statutes; it would tilt the scales of justice in favor of the \n29 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 30 of 56 PageID #:\n1281\n \nstrong or popular and neglect the promise that all persons are entitled to the benefit \nof the law’s terms.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 677–78 (cleaned up). \n  In Davis, 526 U.S. at 649–50, the Supreme Court decided that “having \npreviously determined that ‘sexual harassment’ is ‘discrimination’ in the school \ncontext under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude that student-on-student \nsexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of \ndiscrimination actionable under the statute.”  In reaching this decision, the \nSupreme Court explained:  \nThe requirement that recipients receive adequate notice of Title IX’s \nproscriptions also bears on the proper definition of “discrimination” in the \ncontext of a private damages action. We have elsewhere concluded that \nsexual harassment is a form of discrimination for Title IX purposes and that \nTitle IX proscribes harassment with sufficient clarity to satisfy Pennhurst’s \nnotice requirement and serve as a basis for a damages action. See Gebser v. \nLago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U.S., at 281; Franklin v. Gwinnett \nCounty Public Schools, 503 U.S., at 74–75.  See Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. \nof Ed., 470 U.S. 656, 665–666 (1985) (rejecting claim of insufficient notice \nunder Pennhurst where statute made clear that there were some conditions \nplaced on receipt of federal funds, and noting that Congress need not \n“specifically identif[y] and proscrib[e]” each condition in the legislation). \nThe statute’s other prohibitions, moreover, help give content to the term \n“discrimination” in this context.  Students are not only protected from \ndiscrimination, but also specifically shielded from being “excluded from \nparticipation in” or “denied the benefits of” any “education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” § 1681(a).  The statute \nmakes clear that, whatever else it prohibits, students must not be denied \naccess to educational benefits and opportunities on the basis of gender.  \n \nId. at 649-50.  For these reasons, the Supreme Court held: \n \nWe thus conclude that funding recipients are properly held liable in damages \nonly where they are deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which \n30 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 31 of 56 PageID #:\n1282\n \nthey have actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the \neducational opportunities or benefits provided by the school. \n \nId. at 650. \n  To decide whether “gender-oriented conduct rises to the level of actionable \n‘harassment’ under Title IX thus depends on a constellation of surrounding \ncircumstances, expectations, and relationships, including, but not limited to, the \nages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved, see \nOCR Title IX Guidelines 12041–12042.”  Davis, 526 U.S. at 651.  The Supreme \nCourt cautioned that “schools are unlike the adult workplace and that children may \nregularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among adults.  Indeed, at \nleast early on, students are still learning how to interact appropriately with their \npeers.  It is thus understandable that, in the school setting, students often engage in \ninsults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing, and gender-specific conduct that is \nupsetting to the students subjected to it.  Damages are not available for simple acts \nof teasing and name-calling among school children, however, even where these \ncomments target differences in gender.  Rather, in the context of student-on-\nstudent harassment, damages are available only where the behavior is so severe, \npervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to \neducation that Title IX is designed to protect.”  Id. at 651-52. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 32 of 56 PageID #:\n1283\n \n  The Supreme Court considered that “in theory, a single instance of \nsufficiently severe one-on-one peer harassment could be said to have such an \neffect,”  Davis, 526 U.S. at 652, but ultimately concluded that it was “unlikely that \nCongress would have thought such behavior sufficient to rise to this level in light \nof the inevitability of student misconduct and the amount of litigation that would \nbe invited by entertaining claims of official indifference to a single instance of one-\non-one peer harassment.”  Id. at 652-53.  It concluded that such a rule “limiting \nprivate damages actions to cases having a systemic effect on educational programs \nor activities reconciles the general principle that Title IX prohibits official \nindifference to known peer sexual harassment with the practical realities of \nresponding to student behavior, realities that Congress could not have meant to be \nignored.”  Id. at 653 (cleaned up). \nSuccess on the Merits \n  “While no single factor is determinative, the probability of success factor is \nthe most significant.”  Cigna Corporation v. Bricker, 103 F.4th 1336, 1342 (8th \nCir. 2024) (cleaned up).  “A movant shows a likelihood of success on the merits \nwhen it demonstrates a fair chance, not necessarily greater than fifty percent, that \nit will ultimately prevail under applicable law.”  Id. at 1343 (cleaned up) (emphasis \nadded).   \n32 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 33 of 56 PageID #:\n1284\n \n  Plaintiffs allege the Final Rule is contrary to law, exceeds the Department’s \nstatutory authority, and is arbitrary and capricious.  For purposes of deciding this \nmotion, however, it is only necessary to determine whether plaintiffs have met \ntheir preliminary burden of demonstrating a fair chance that they will prevail on \nthe merits of their claim that the Department exceeded its statutory authority and/or \nacted contrary to law when it applied the Bostock holding to interpret the phrase \n“on the basis of sex” in Title IX.   \n  Similar cases have been filed in district courts across the country.  See, \nLouisiana v. Dept. of Educ., 2024 WL 2978786, at *2 (W.D. La. June 13, 2024); \nTennessee v. Cardona, 2024 WL 3019146 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024); Kansas, v. \nDept. of Educ., 2024 WL 3273285 (D.

See Bricker, 103 F.4th at 1344.  \n  The Court must ultimately decide the meaning of sex under Title IX.  Loper \nBright Enterprises v. Raimondo, -- S. Ct. --, 2024 WL 3208360, at *22 (U.S. June \n28, 2024).   “Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether \nan agency has acted within its statutory authority.”  Id. at *22 (cleaned up).  If an \nagency’s interpretation of its statutory authority “is not the one the court, after \napplying all relevant interpretive tools, concludes is best, it is not permissible.”  Id. \nat *16 (cleaned up). \n  Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of \nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Sex is not defined in Title IX, so the court must \ninterpret the word “consistent with their ordinary meaning . . . at the time Congress \n \n5 Moreover, in a similar case the district court for the Southern District of Mississippi enjoined the \nimplementation of a final rule issued by the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices  (“HHS”)  on  May  6,  2024,  which  purportedly  implements  the  prohibition  of \ndiscrimination set forth in Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).

Cent. Ltd v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 284 (2018).  \nTitle IX’s scope is determined by examining its “text in light of context, structure, \nand related statutory provisions.”  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., \n545 U.S. 546, 558 (2005).  After preliminary review and without ultimately \ndeciding the issue, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have a fair chance of \nprevailing on their argument that the unambiguous plain language of Title IX and \nthe legislative history support their position that the term “sex” means biological \nsex. \n  At the time Title IX was enacted in 1972, the term “sex” was understood to \nmean the biological distinctions between males and females.  See Tennessee, 2024 \nWL 3019146, at *9 (citing The American College Dictionary 1109 (1970) and \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1971) (sex was defined as \n“one of the two divisions of organic [sic] esp. human beings respectively \ndesignated male or female”).  The legislative history also supports a finding that \nthe term “sex” refers to biological sex as one of the principal purposes of the \nstatute was to root out discrimination against women in education. 118 Cong. Rec. \nat 5,803.  The legislative history, which includes statistics on the number of \nwomen and men being included in various programs and activities, shows that \nCongress was concerned about the unequal treatment between men and women for \nadmissions opportunities, scholarships, and sports.  Id. at 5,803–06.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 36 of 56 PageID #:\n1287\n \n  The plaintiffs’ argument that the term “sex” means biological sex finds \nsupport in the text of the statute itself.  As plaintiffs point out, Title IX explicitly \nprovides exceptions to the nondiscrimination mandate, including “father-son” and \n“mother-daughter” activities, which if provided for “one sex,” shall not be \nprecluded for the “other sex” as long as the “other sex” has opportunities for \n“reasonably comparable activities.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8).  Title IX also carves \nout an exception permitting an educational institution’s maintenance of “separate \nliving facilities for the different sexes.”  Id. § 1686.  Finally, Title IX separately \nand explicitly refers to “transgender status” in § 1689.   As the foregoing \nauthorities demonstrate, plaintiffs have a fair chance of prevailing on their claim \nthat the term “sex” as used in Title IX refers to biological sex rather than “gender \nidentity.” \n  Defendants contend that even if the term “sex” in Title IX means biological \nsex, discrimination on the basis of gender identity is discrimination on the basis of \nbiological sex, citing Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655.   Therefore, the Department \ncontends that the Final Rule is not contrary to Title IX.  \n  After preliminary review and without ultimately deciding the issue, the \nCourt is persuaded that plaintiffs have a fair chance of prevailing on their \nargument that the reasoning of Bostock, a Title VII employment discrimination \ncase, should not apply to Title IX.  Bostock held that “an employer who fires an \n36 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 37 of 56 PageID #:\n1288\n \nindividual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or \nactions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a \nnecessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”  \nId. at 651–52.   \n  Although Title IX also prohibits sex discrimination, the Supreme Court has \nsaid that “Title VII is a vastly different statute from Title IX.”  Jackson v. \nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005) (cleaned up).  “Title IX \ncondition[s] an offer of federal funding on a recipient’s promise not to \ndiscriminate, in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government \nand the recipient.  That contractual framework distinguishes Title IX from Title \nVII, which is framed in terms not of a condition but of an outright prohibition [of \ndiscrimination].”  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 277 (cleaned up).  Since Title IX was \nenacted pursuant to Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause of the \nConstitution, Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 218 \n(2022), the Supreme Court “insists that Congress speak with a clear voice” when \nimposing conditions on the receipt of federal funds, “recognizing that there can, of \ncourse, be no knowing acceptance of the terms of the putative contract if a State is \nunaware of the conditions imposed by the legislation or is unable to ascertain what \nis expected of it.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 (cleaned up).   \n37 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 38 of 56 PageID #:\n1289\n \n  In contrast, Title VII was enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause, which \ngrants Congress “expansive” regulatory power.  See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 549-50 (2012) (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3)).  For \nthese reasons, “the requirement that recipients receive adequate notice of Title IX’s \nproscriptions bears on the proper definition of ‘discrimination’ in the context of a \nprivate damages action,” Davis, 526 U.S. at 651 (cleaned up), whereas “whether a \nspecific application [of Title VII] was anticipated is irrelevant.”  Bostock 590 U.S. \n644 at 677 (cleaned up).   \n  Significantly, Title IX includes several exceptions to the prohibition on sex \ndiscrimination that are not present in Title VII.  See § 1681(a)(1)–(9).  These \nexceptions explicitly allow discrimination based on biological sex and demonstrate \nthat not all differential treatment based on biological sex is discrimination under \nTitle IX.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1686 (Title IX recipient may maintain “separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes.”).  Other courts considering this issue have \nconcluded that this “instruction is the authoritative expression of Congress’s view \nthat separating the two sexes ‘where personal privacy must be preserved’ is not the \ntype of discrimination prohibited by the statute.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *32 \n(citing 118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (Feb. 28, 1972)); Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *10 \n(bathrooms and locker rooms impacted by the Final Rule appear to fall under the \nstatutory category of “living facilities;” and given Congress’s expressly stated \n38 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 39 of 56 PageID #:\n1290\n \nconcern about privacy for students, it would be counterintuitive if that privacy only \nextended to students who lived in student housing) (citing A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. \nSch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760, 770 (7th Cir. 2023)).  As another district \ncourt recently concluded, Title IX “prohibits differential treatment that disfavors, \ndenies, excludes, or otherwise treats one biological sex worse than the other.  But \nTitle IX does not prohibit differential treatment that allows for sex-separation or \nsex-specific benefits, provided that one biological sex is not treated as inferior to \nthe other in the process.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *31. \n  Further, Title IX is about schools, and as the Supreme Court has observed, \n“schools are unlike the adult workplace.”  Davis, 526 U.S. at 675 (cleaned up). The \nSupreme Court in Bostock also explicitly declined to address any other laws and \nthe meaning of their terms or whether its holding would be applicable to \n“bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”  590 U.S. at 681 (“[N]one \nof these other [sex discrimination] laws are before us; we have not had the benefit \nof adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any \nsuch question today.”) (cleaned up).  \n  Given that notice is the touchstone of Title IX, the statute contains no \ndefinition of sex or express prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity, and it expressly permits sex-based differential treatment in certain \ncircumstances, plaintiff States have met their preliminary burden of establishing a \n39 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 40 of 56 PageID #:\n1291\n \nfair chance of prevailing on their argument that they lacked constitutionally \nsufficient notice that sex discrimination would be interpreted as including gender \nidentity discrimination when they accepted federal funding under Title IX. \n  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has not decided the issue at bar.  \nHowever, it has stated that “Title VII cases provide guidance in evaluating Title IX \nclaims.”  Wolfe v. Fayetteville, Arkansas School Dist., 648 F.3d 860, 866 (8th Cir. \n2011) (cleaned up).   \n  There is circuit support for the Department’s application of Bostock to Title \nIX.  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has cited Bostock for the proposition that \n“discrimination against a person for being transgender is discrimination ‘on the \nbasis of sex’” in violation of Title IX.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 \nF.3d 586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020).  The Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals “applied Bostock’s reasoning to Title IX, and had no trouble \nconcluding that discrimination against transgender persons is sex discrimination \nfor Title IX purposes, just as it is for Title VII purposes.”  A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. \nSch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760, 769 (7th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). The \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals also concluded that Bostock’s reasoning applies to \nTitle IX when it held that “discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a \nform of sex-based discrimination under Title IX.”  Grabowski v. Ariz. Bd. of \nRegents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116 (9th Cir. 2023).   However, the Supreme Court has \n40 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 41 of 56 PageID #:\n1292\n \ncautioned courts from “reading too much into too little,” because “the language of \nan opinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with language of a \nstatute.”  Nat’l Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 373–74 (2023) \n(cleaned up). \n  After due consideration of all the foregoing authorities in light of the \naforementioned differences between the two statutes, Bostock’s express disavowal \nto bathrooms or locker rooms or other statutory schemes, and in the absence of \ncontrolling authority, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have met their preliminary \nburden of demonstrating a fair chance of prevailing on their argument that Bostock \nshould not apply to Title IX and that the Department exceeded its statutory \nauthority and/or acted contrary to law in redefining “on the basis of sex” for \npurposes of Title IX.   \n  The Court need not, and therefore does not, consider plaintiff’s additional \narguments regarding the Final Rule’s alleged infirmities with respect to the Rule’s \ndefinition of “sex” at this time given that its previous finding is sufficient to \ndemonstrate success on the merits upon consideration of the pending motion for \npreliminary relief.  And as the Final Rule’s definition of sex discrimination is \nnecessarily incorporated into the Rule’s definitions of sex-based harassment and \nhostile environment sex-based harassment, the Court likewise concludes that \nplaintiffs have met their preliminary burden of demonstrating a fair chance of \n41 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 42 of 56 PageID #:\n1293\n \nprevailing on their argument that the Department exceeded its statutory authority in \nexpanding the definition of sex-based harassment for the reasons set forth above.   \n  In addition, plaintiffs argue the Final Rule’s “severe or pervasive” standard, \nwhich considers speech or other expressive conduct that “limits” a person’s ability \nto participate in a program to be discriminatory harassment, cannot be squared with \nTitle IX as interpreted by the Supreme Court or the First Amendment.  In Davis, \nthe Supreme Court held that harassment becomes actionable discrimination “under \nthe recipient’s programs” when it “is so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it effectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity \nor benefit” and when “the recipient exercises substantial control over both the \nharasser and the context.”  526 U.S. at 633, 645 (cleaned up).   The Final Rule \nstates that the “final definition is not identical to Davis because the Department \nbelieves a broader standard is appropriate,”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498 (cleaned up), \nbecause Davis was about private lawsuits whereas the Final Rule applies to \n“administrative enforcement.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,560.   \n  Given the Court’s foregoing conclusion with respect to the definition of \n“sex” under Title IX, the Supreme Court’s recent pronouncement regarding the \nlimits of agency deference in Loper Bright, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have \nmet their preliminary burden of demonstrating that they have a fair chance on \nprevailing on their claim that the Department’s decision to expand the definition of \n42 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 43 of 56 PageID #:\n1294\n \nsexual harassment beyond the standard articulated in Davis based on an \n“administrative enforcement” justification exceeds the Department’s statutory \nauthority and/or is contrary to law.   \n  Plaintiffs also contend that the Final Rule’s harassment definition runs afoul \nof the First Amendment by unconstitutionally chilling speech.  Other courts \nconsidering this issue have explained at length the potential ways in which the \nFinal Rule’s interpretation of sex in combination with its definition of sexual \nharassment may run afoul of the First Amendment.  See Tennessee, 2024 WL \n3019146, at *17-27; Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *13-*15; Louisiana, 2024 WL \n2978786, at *12-13;.  After due consideration of these persuasive authorities, and \ngiven the Eighth Circuit’s recent acknowledgment that the Constitution does not \nrequire government officials to use “preferred gender pronouns” “in part because \nthe speaker has a First Amendment right” to even “the misuse of a pronoun,” \nBeard v. Falkenrath, 97 F.4th 1109, 1117 (8th Cir. 2024) (cleaned up), the Court \nconcludes that plaintiffs have met their preliminary burden of demonstrating at \nleast a fair chance of prevailing on their claim that the Rule violates the First \nAmendment.  For these reasons, the Court further finds that the plaintiffs have met \ntheir preliminary burden of demonstrating a fair chance of prevailing on their \nargument that the Department exceeded its statutory authority and/or acted in \ncontravention of the law in expanding the definition of sex-based harassment.   \n43 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 44 of 56 PageID #:\n1295\n \n  Therefore, as to the first element necessary to secure preliminary relief, the \nCourt concludes that plaintiffs have demonstrated success on the merits in that it \nfinds that plaintiffs have met their preliminary burden of demonstrating a fair \nchance of prevailing on their argument that the Department exceeded its statutory \nauthority in expanding the definitions of sex discrimination and sex-based \nharassment and that the Final Rule’s interpretation of sex and discrimination are \ntherefore contrary to Title IX.  See Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *13; \nLouisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *12; Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *17. \n  Given that the Final Rule carves out an exception for athletics regulation, \nand there is a separate proposed rule that will amend the athletics regulation, the \nCourt has not considered the arguments on athletics in its determination of whether \nplaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating success on the merits of their \nclaim that the Department acted without statutory authority in promulgating the \nFinal Rule.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *14 (declining to consider the \neffect of the Final Rule on sports at the preliminary injunction stage due to the \nproposed rule); Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *11 (same). \nIrreparable Harm \n  “Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, \ntypically because its injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of \ndamages.”  Gen. Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown’s, LLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. \n44 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 45 of 56 PageID #:\n1296\n \n2009).  To show irreparable harm, “a party must show that the harm is certain and \ngreat and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable \nrelief.”  Dakotans for Health v. Noem, 52 F.4th 381, 392 (8th Cir. 2022) (cleaned \nup).  Plaintiffs must show the harm is “not merely a possibility but is likely to \noccur absent preliminary injunctive relief.”  Morehouse Enterprises, LLC v. \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 78 F.4th 1011, 1017 (8th \nCir. 2023) (cleaned up). \n  Like the other courts faced with this issue, the Court likewise concludes that \nplaintiffs have made a sufficient showing of irreparable injury if the Final Rule \ngoes into effect on August 1.  Plaintiff States will incur costs that cannot be \nrecouped including costs to update policies, materials, and hiring additional Title \nIX staff.  Further, States are required to comply with the Final Rule in a short \nperiod of time.  “Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that the compliance \ncosts here are extraordinary due to the sweeping policy changes they are required \nto implement and the short timeframe in which they must do so.  And because the \nrecovery of these costs would necessarily be barred, this factor weighs in favor of a \nfinding of irreparable harm.”   Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *39 (citing \nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in part) (“[C]omplying with a regulation later held invalid almost \nalways produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”)); \n45 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 46 of 56 PageID #:\n1297\n \nIowa Utilities Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996) (“The threat of \nunrecoverable economic loss, however, does qualify as irreparable harm.”).  \nPlaintiff States have also sufficiently demonstrated that the Final Rule, if allowed \nto take effect, would prevent enforcement of several enumerated laws, which \nsuffices to show irreparable harm.  The injury that results when a State cannot \nenforce “statutes enacted by representatives of its people” is irreparable.  Maryland \nv. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (cleaned up); see also, Org. for Black \nStruggle v. Ashcroft, 978 F.3d 603, 609 (8th Cir. 2020).  Further, A.F. has shown \nirreparable harm, not only with respect to her sense of personal privacy, but also \nwith respect to the potential violation of her First Amendment rights.  Louisiana, \n2024 WL 2978786, at *19.  “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); see also Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *17. \n  For these reasons, the Court finds that plaintiffs are likely to suffer \nsignificant irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. \nPublic Interest/Balance of the Equities \n  Finally, the Court must determine whether plaintiffs have shown that the \n“balance of equities tips in their favor” and that “an injunction is in the public \ninterest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Courts “must balance the competing claims of \ninjury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of \n46 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 47 of 56 PageID #:\n1298\n \nthe requested relief.”  Id. at 24.  When the party opposing the injunction is the \nfederal government, the balance-of-harms factor merges with the public-interest \nfactor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 436. \n  Although the Department could face irreparable harm if unable to enforce a \nvalid regulation, any interest the Department may have in enforcing a Final Rule \nthat is contrary to law is not outweighed by plaintiffs’ interests in having their \nconstitutional rights protected.  See Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *17.  Further, \nthe Court concludes that it is in the public interest to prevent the violation of \nconstitutional rights.  Id. \n  The Court also considers the fact that the regulations currently in effect have \nessentially “been unchanged for approximately 50 years. Therefore, it would be of \nrelatively little harm to others to maintain the status quo pending the resolution of \nthis lawsuit.”  Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *18 (quoting Tennessee, 2024 WL \n3019146, *42).  The Court finds that these factors weigh in favor of plaintiffs. \n  Upon due consideration of the principles underlying preliminary injunctions \nand the magnitude of the Final Rule’s impact upon plaintiffs, the importance of \nenjoining the Final Rule, and thus preserving the status quo, is imperative.  See \nDataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113, 113 n.5 (8th Cir. 1981). \n  The Court finds that in balancing the equities, the scale tips in favor of \nplaintiffs and of the issuance of preliminary relief. \n47 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 48 of 56 PageID #:\n1299\n \nScope of Injunction \n  Plaintiffs seek to stay the Final Rule in its entirety and also ask the Court for \na nationwide preliminary injunction.  In response, defendants ask the court to allow \nsome parts of the Final Rule to go forward and to limit any injunctive relief to the \nplaintiff States and A.F.  Defendants point to the severability clause contained in \neach subsection in the current regulations which provides: “If any provision of this \nsubpart or its application to any person, act, or practice is held invalid, the \nremainder of the subpart or the application of its provisions to any person, act, or \npractice shall not be affected thereby.”  34 C.F.R. §§ 106.9; 106.18; 106.48; see \nalso 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,848. \n  “Traditionally, when a federal court finds a remedy merited, it provides \nparty-specific relief, directing the defendant to take or not take some action relative \nto the plaintiff.”  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 693  (2023) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring) (citing Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931 (1975)) \n(“[N]either declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with the \nenforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the \nparticular federal plaintiffs.”).  Nationwide injunctions are a “relatively new \nphenomenon” and a phenomenon which the Supreme Court has yet to fully \naddress.  See Labrador v. Poe by & through Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 925, 926 (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (discussing that “the propriety of universal injunctive \n48 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 49 of 56 PageID #:\n1300\n \nrelief [is] a question of great significance that has been in need of the Court’s \nattention for some time.”).  Problems with nationwide injunctions include \ndepriving other courts of the opportunity to weigh in on these important questions, \nencouraging forum shopping, and circumventing rules governing class-wide relief. \nTexas, 599 U.S. at 694 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n  Issuing a nationwide injunction in this case would prevent the Final Rule \nfrom taking effect for those States not requesting such relief, as evidenced in the \namicus brief.  ECF 43.  As previously indicated, this issue is currently being \nlitigated in several districts and a nationwide injunction may result in one or more \nof those courts concluding that the plaintiffs can no longer show an irreparable \ninjury in light of a decision granting universal relief.  Courts in Kansas, Tennessee, \nand Louisiana refrained from issuing nationwide injunctions at least in part \nbecause of the ongoing litigation in other courts.6   \n  In formulating a preliminary injunction, the court is to exercise its discretion \nand judgment in light of the “equities of a given case [and] the substance of the \nlegal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n579–80 (2017) (cleaned up).  The “court need not grant the total relief sought by \nthe applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular \n \n6 The Northern District of Texas has ordered additional briefing on the appropriate nature and \nscope of injunctive relief.  See Carroll Independent Sch. Dist, Cause No. 4:24CV461-0 (ECF 46-\n2). \n49 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 50 of 56 PageID #:\n1301\n \ncase.”  Id. at 580 (cleaned up).  “Injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to \nthe defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Madsen \nv. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (cleaned up). \n  In light of the foregoing, the court declines to issue a nationwide preliminary \ninjunction in this case. \n  Although the Court did not explicitly address all of the provisions in the \nFinal Rule or the reasons advanced for its invalidity, given the Court’s rulings with \nrespect to the definition of sex discrimination and the fact that the definition \npermeates the entire Rule, the Court concludes that it would be a nearly impossible \ntask to excise the remaining regulations without also eliminating those regulations \nthat involve sex discrimination.  See, Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *43; \nKansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *18.  Nor would the potential harms to plaintiffs be \nfully remedied by enjoining only those portions of the Final Rule set out in \ndefendants’ proposed findings and conclusions.  ECF 50 at 50.  The Court also \ndeclines to parse out the sections that may remain as “rulemaking is exclusively \nwithin the purview of the Executive Branch.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at \n*43 (citing Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, 546 U.S. 320, \n330 (2006)) (courts must ask whether the legislature would have “preferred what is \nleft of its statute to no statute at all”); Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at *18. \n50 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 51 of 56 PageID #:\n1302\n \n  The Court notes that both the Fifth and Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeal \ndeclined to issue stays preventing the preliminary injunctions from taking effect in \nthe Tennessee and Louisiana cases.  See Tennessee v. Cardona, No. 24-5588 (6th \nCir. Jul. 17, 2024); Louisiana v. Dept. of Educ., No. 24-30399 (5th Cir. Jul. 17, \n2024).  ECF 52-1; 52-2.  In both of those underlying cases, the district courts \npreliminarily enjoined the Final Rule from taking effect in its entirety.  See, \nTennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *43; Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *21. \n  The Sixth Circuit rejected the Department’s request to narrow the scope of \nthe preliminary injunction to the same provisions of the Final Rule proposed by \ndefendants here as follows: \nTurn, then, to the scope of the preliminary injunction. As just shown, we \ndisagree with the key premise of the Department’s scope-of-the-injunction \nargument: its position that the court should not have extended the injunction \nto § 106.10’s new definition of sex discrimination. Our reasoning shows at a \nminimum that the preliminary injunction properly extends to three central \nprovisions of the Rule: §§ 106.10, 106.2’s definition of hostile environment \nharassment, and 106.31(a). \n \nAfter that, the problem is that these provisions, particularly the new \ndefinition of sex discrimination, appear to touch every substantive provision \nof the Rule.  It is thus unsurprising, as the Department fairly acknowledges, \nthat there are “numerous” references to sex discrimination throughout the \nRule. Dep’t Supp. Br. 3.  In reality, each of the remaining provisions that the \nDepartment seeks to implement on August 1 implicates the new definition of \nsex discrimination. Take the Rule's record-keeping provision, § 106.8(f), \nwhich requires schools to preserve any notice sent to the Title IX \ncoordinator of “conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination,” \nas well as the investigation and grievance records for “each complaint of sex \ndiscrimination.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33886.  Or § 106.2’s definition of sex-based \nharassment, which amounts to “a form of sex discrimination . . . including \n51 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 52 of 56 PageID #:\n1303\n \non the bases identified in § 106.10, that [includes] . . . [h]ostile environment \nharassment.”  Id. at 33884.  Or § 106.8, which imposes various new \nobligations on schools to comply with the new sex discrimination \nrequirements: appointing Title IX coordinators, requiring training on the \nnew scope of sex discrimination, and the like.  ld. at 33885.  Or § 106.11, \nwhich clarifies that the Rule generally requires schools to respond to sex \ndiscrimination in the United States and sometimes to sex discrimination \nelsewhere. Id. at 33886.  Or § 106.40, which requires Title IX coordinators \nto “promptly and effectively prevent sex discrimination” by taking actions \nlike ensuring access to lactation spaces.  Id. at 33887-88.  Or § 106.44, \nwhich requires any funding recipient “with knowledge of conduct that \nreasonably may constitute sex discrimination” to respond promptly with a \nseries of corrective measures.  Id. at 33888.  Or the Rule’s grievance \nprocedures and retaliation provision, §§ 106.45-.46, .71, which impose new \nrules for dealing with complaints of sex discrimination, sex-based \nharassment, and retaliation for reporting the same. ld. at 33891-96. \n \nThrough it all, each of the provisions that the Department wishes to begin \nenforcing on August 1 implicates the new definition of sex discrimination.  \nIt is hard to see how all of the schools covered by Title IX could comply \nwith this wide swath of new obligations if the Rule’s definition of sex \ndiscrimination remains enjoined. Harder still, we question how the schools \ncould properly train their teachers on compliance in this unusual setting with \nso little time before the start of the new school year. \n \nThe Department resists this conclusion.  It argues that the schools could \nenforce these provisions by relying on the prior definition of sex \ndiscrimination under its rules and regulations.  If we denied the stay only as \nto the three core provisions identified above, the Department thus \nhypothesizes, the pre-existing definition could govern the rest of the Rule on \nAugust 1.  We see a few problems with this argument.  One is that we do not \nknow the meaning of that pre-existing definition.  As the Department points \nout, even that definition is “the subject of separate litigation.”  Dep’t Supp. \nBr. 3 n.1 (citing Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., 104 F.4th 577 (6th Cir. 2024)). \nAnother problem is that the Department has not identified any evidence that \nit contemplated, during the rulemaking process, how the remainder of the \nRule would apply without any of its core provisions.  Yes, there are \nseverability provisions that would apply to the Rule, and the Department \nconsidered the possibility that a court might sever § 106.10 from the rest of \nthe Rule.  89 Fed. Reg. 33848.  But it did not contemplate enforcement of \n52 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 53 of 56 PageID #:\n1304\n \nthe Rule without any of the core provisions.  Nor is there any suggestion that \nthe cost-benefit analyses underlying the Rule contemplated the idea of \nallowing these provisions to go into effect with a different definition of sex \ndiscrimination.  \n \nIn addition, it bears emphasizing how the Department framed its arguments \nbelow.  The Department, to be sure, did identify the severability provisions. \nBut it mainly used them to permit the new definition of sex discrimination to \ngo into effect, not to allow other provisions to go into effect under the prior \ndefinition of sex discrimination.  In fact, the Department mentioned \nseverability below in just a few lines of its briefs without telling the district \ncourt which other provisions should be severed. At least in the context of \nthis emergency stay motion, we are uncomfortable granting more relief than \nthe Department sought below. As shown, all of the provisions the \nDepartment now asks to go into effect implicate the new definition of sex \ndiscrimination.  \n \nThe other stay factors.   \nThe equities, too, favor this approach.  From an equitable perspective, \neducators should not be forced to determine whether this or that section of \nthe new Rule must be followed when the new definition of sex \ndiscrimination might or might not touch the Rule.  The States presented \nevidence that rolling out hundreds of pages of a new rule on August 1, just \nbefore the start of the school year, will place an onerous burden on them-\nloads of time and lots of costs that will only escalate if we leave confusion \nover the States' obligations under the Rule.  That is particularly problematic \ngiven that the new definition of sex discrimination affects each provision of \nthe Rule that the Department asked to go into immediate effect. \n \nThe States, to be sure, have acknowledged that some technical provisions of \nthe Rule do not necessarily implicate the new definition of sex \ndiscrimination and are not already covered by prior regulations.  But the \nDepartment did not identify these provisions in its request for relief.  And \nwith good reason, it appears.  The provisions merely include definitions of \nfour terms (“parental status,” “party,” “pregnancy or related conditions,” and \n“student with a disability”), as well as eight technical amendments to \nexisting Title IX regulations.  See States’ Supp. Br. 25 (citing § 106.3 \n[Amended]; § 106.15 (amending existing § 106.15); § 106.16 [Removed]; § \n106.17 [Removed]; § 106.18 [Redesignated as § 106.16]; § 106.41 \n53 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 54 of 56 PageID #:\n1305\n \n[Amended] (removing existing § 106.41(d)); § 106.46 [Redesignated as § \n106.48]; and § 106.51 [Employment] (amending existing § 106.51(b)(6))).  \n \nAlthough a merits panel is free to consider whether the scope of the \ninjunction should be narrowed to permit these technical provisions to go \nforward, the Department at this stage has not identified any harms that come \nfrom the preliminary injunction’s coverage of these particular provisions. \nFor that reason, and with the goal of avoiding any confusion that would \ncome from enjoining all but the most technical portions of the Rule on the \neve of a new school year, we will not exercise our “judicial discretion” to \ngrant a stay on these points. Nken, 556 U.S. at 433.  \n \nWe therefore deny the motion to stay the district court's preliminary \ninjunction. \n \nTennessee v. Cardona, No. 24-5588 (6th Cir. Jul. 17, 2024).  ECF 52-1.  This \nreasoning also applies to the instant motion before the Court. \n  Finally, as noted by another district court, “nothing in this order limits the \nability of any school to adopt or follow its own policies, or otherwise comply with \napplicable state or local laws or rules regarding the subjects addressed herein. \nRather, it simply prohibits defendants from demanding compliance with the Final \nRule by the schools affected by this order, or imposing any consequences for such \nschools’ failure to comply with the Final Rule.”  Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285, at \n*21; see ECF 43 at 5-6 (solutions implemented by school districts in other states to \naddress nondiscrimination and privacy concerns include curtains and changing \nschedules). \n \n \n54 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS     Doc. #:  54     Filed: 07/24/24     Page: 55 of 56 PageID #:\n1306\n \nBond \n  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), the Court may issue an injunction “only if” the \nmoving party provides security sufficient to cover damages sustained by the \nenjoined party if that enjoined party were wrongly enjoined.

Corp., 528 F.2d 949, 951 (8th Cir. 1976) (cleaned up).  “Courts in this \ncircuit have almost always required a bond before issuing a preliminary injunction, \nbut exceptions have been made where the defendant has not objected to the failure \nto require a bond or where the damages resulting from a wrongful issuance of an \ninjunction have not been shown.”  Richland/Wilkin Joint Powers Auth. v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engr’s, 826 F.3d 1030, 1043 (8th Cir. 2016) (cleaned up). \nDefendants do not object to waiver of the bond requirement and have not \ndemonstrated any costs or monetary damages that may result from issuance of the \ninjunction.  Under these circumstances, the Court will exercise its discretion to \nwaive Rule 65(c)’s bond requirement.  See First Lutheran Church v. City of St. \nPaul, 326 F. Supp. 3d 745, 769 (D.

But last month, the \nDepartment of Education issued a rule radically reinterpreting that half-century-old \nstatute and rolling back those protections.  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of \nSex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, \n89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  \nThat rule takes effect August 1, 2024, and it requires States, schools, and \nuniversities to ignore biological sex in favor of self-professed “gender identity.”  \nIndeed, if allowed to take effect, that rule will gut the very athletic opportunities \nthat Title IX was designed to provide; destroy the privacy protections women and \ngirls currently enjoy in restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, and overnight \naccommodations; preempt numerous State laws; silence and threaten with \ninvestigation any student, faculty member, or administrator who doesn’t share the \nDepartment’s view of sex; and deny federal funding to any school or university \nthat doesn’t adhere to those views. \nFor numerous reasons, that rule violates the federal Constitution and the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.  It should immediately be set aside.   \nI.  Parties \n1.   Plaintiff the State of Arkansas is a sovereign State of the United States \nof America.  Tim Griffin is the Attorney General of Arkansas.

Plaintiff A.F. is a 15-year-old female resident of Jonesboro, Arkansas.  \nShe is a Christian and believes that God created every person to be immutably either \nmale or female.  In following her religious beliefs, she only addresses and refers to \nother people using pronouns or titles consistent with the person’s sex.  She believes \nthat, were she to use pronouns or titles that contradict the person’s sex, she would \nviolate her religious beliefs and be lying about what she knows to be true. \n8.  A.F. is a 10th-grade student at Brookland High School, a public school \nin Brookland, Arkansas that is a recipient of federals funds subject to Title IX.  She \nuses the female-designated restrooms at her school and feels safe knowing that boys \nare not allowed to use the girls’ restroom.  She does not want to use the restroom \nwith a male, even if that male considers himself to be a female.  If male students \nwere allowed to use the female restrooms at her school, she would do her best to \navoid any women’s restroom that a male could access. \n4 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 5 of 62 PageID #: 5\n \n9.  At Brookland High School, A.F. competes on the girls’ basketball team \nand intends to keep competing in sports for her school throughout high school.  She \nuses the school locker room to change clothes for games.  At her school, the locker \nroom is mainly an open area where girls on sports teams change clothes in front of \ntheir lockers.  Sometimes they must share a locker.  She and her teammates can see \neach other as they change clothes to prepare for games.  Like many girls, she desires \nprivacy from the opposite sex while changing clothes.  If she were forced to share a \nlocker room and change clothes in front of a male, or be present in the locker room \nwhile a male is changing clothes near her, she would suffer deep distress and \nembarrassment.  She would be forced to change in a different room or area to protect \nher privacy. \n10.  A.F. would not shower in her locker room with a male nearby.  Like \nmany girls, she desires privacy from the opposite sex while showering.  She feels \nsafe and comfortable knowing that boys are not allowed in the girls’ locker room \nand  shower  area.    It  would  cause  her  to  feel  extremely  unsafe,  anxious,  and \nembarrassed to shower in the girls’ locker room if males were allowed to be present \nin there.  To avoid this situation, she would instead stop showering in the women’s \nlocker room or seek out a safe place to shower that males could not access. \n11.  A.F. travels on overnight trips with her sports teams during the school \nyear and for overnight sports camps over the summer.  She often must travel to \n5 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 6 of 62 PageID #: 6\n \ndifferent cities and stay multiple nights to play against other teams.  Travel increases \nif her team makes the playoffs.  This past year, her school volleyball and basketball \nteams made it through the playoffs and to the state championships.  This required \ntravel and overnight stays of about one week for each team championship.  When \ntraveling overnight for school activities, she often shares a room with other students.  \nShe desires privacy from the opposite sex while sleeping, changing clothes, and \nshowering during overnight trips.  She would feel deeply uncomfortable if she were \nforced to share a room with a male during an overnight trip.      \n12.  A.F. believes strongly in the importance of protecting women’s sports \nand that men should not be allowed to compete on sports teams or in competitions \nthat are designated for female athletes.  If she and other female athletes are forced \nto compete against males, they would be at a competitive disadvantage due to the \ninherent physiological differences between female and male athletic capacities.  \nThis will result in female athletes like A.F. being displaced from sports teams and \ncompetitions by male athletes.  Competing against male athletes will also increase \nthe risk that female athletes like A.F. will be suffer injuries.   \n13.  A.F. also wishes to express her views about gender identity to her \nclassmates and coaches at school, as she has in the past.  This expression includes \nadvocating that only women be allowed to play women’s sports, that male athletes \n6 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 7 of 62 PageID #: 7\n \nwho identify as female are not in fact female, and that it would be unfair to let these \nmales play on women’s sports teams. \n14.  Defendant U.S. Department of Education is a federal agency.  It “is \nauthorized and directed to effectuate” Title IX “by issuing rules, regulations, or \norders of general applicability . . . consistent with achievement of the objectives of \nthe statute.”  20 U.S.C. 1682. \n15.  Defendant Miguel Cardona is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is \nresponsible for its administration, including implementing Title IX via rulemaking.  \n20 U.S.C. 3474; 20 U.S.C. 1682.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n16.  Defendant  Catherine  Lhamon  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Civil \nRights at the Department of Education.  She is sued in her official capacity.  \n17.  Defendant  Randolph  Wills  is  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for \nEnforcement at the Department of Education.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nII.  Jurisdiction and venue \n18.  This action arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681–88, and the Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”), 5 \nU.S.C. 553, 701–06. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1331. \n7 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 8 of 62 PageID #: 8\n \n19.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331 (action arising under \nthe laws of the United States), and 28 U.S.C. 1346 (agencies and employees of the \nfederal government). \n20.  An  actual  controversy  exists  between  the  parties  under  28  U.S.C. \n2201(a). \n21.  This Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other \nrelief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201-02, 5 U.S.C.  705-06, and its inherent equitable \npowers. \n22.  Venue  is  proper  under  28  U.S.C.  1391(e)(1)  because  the  State  of \nMissouri resides in this District for purposes of the venue laws.  Defendants are \nUnited States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities.  The harms giving \nrising to this Complaint occurred and will continue to occur within this District. \n23.  This Court has the authority to grant Plaintiffs the relief they request \nunder the APA, 5 U.S.C. 705-06; the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201-\n02; and 28 U.S.C. 1361.   \nIII.  Background \n24.  Title IX was enacted in 1972 and states: “No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. 1681(a). \n8 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 9 of 62 PageID #: 9\n \nA.  Title IX’s text, structure, and history. \n25.  At the time of Title IX’s enactment (and in the half-century since) “sex” \nwas understood to mean biological sex—either male or female.  Sex is male or \nfemale—which  “is  an  immutable  characteristic  determined”  before  “birth.”  \nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality op.); see, e.g., Sex, \nWebster’s  Third  New  International  Dictionary  2081  (1966)  (“one  of  the  two \ndivisions of organic esp. human beings respectively designated male or female”); \nSex, Webster’s New World Dictionary (1972) (“[E]ither of the two divisions, male \nor female, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their \nreproductive  functions.”);  Sex,  American  Heritage  Dictionary  (1969)  (“a.  The \nproperty or quality by which organisms are classified according to their reproduction \nfunctions.  b.  Either  of  two  divisions,  designated  male  and  female,  of  this \nclassification.”). \n26.  The plain meaning of Title IX’s text confirms this reading.  As the en \nbanc Eleventh Circuit recognized, “[r]eputable dictionary definitions of ‘sex’ from \nthe time of Title IX’s enactment [in 1972] show that when Congress prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education, it meant biological sex, i.e., \ndiscrimination between males and females.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 812 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc). \n9 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 10 of 62 PageID #: 10\n \n27.  The structure of Title IX further underscores that “sex” means “sex”—\nnot gender identity or any other distinct concept.  Title IX expressly states that it \ndoes not “prohibit any educational institution . . . from maintaining separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. 1686.  That provision only makes sense \nif  “sex”  refers  to  the  male-female  binary  and  the  associated  physiological \ndifferences. \n28.  Title IX is replete with further examples of “sex” being referred to as a \nbinary:  \na.  The statute excepts from its coverage a public undergraduate institution \nwith a historic “policy of admitting only students of one sex,” 20 U.S.C. \n1681(a)(5) (emphasis added);  \nb.  Certain  organizations whose  memberships have “traditionally been \nlimited  to  persons  of  one  sex,”  id.  1681(a)(6)  (emphasis  added); \n“father-son  or  mother-daughter  activities,”  so  long  as  similar \nopportunities provided for “one sex” are provided for “the other sex,” \nid. 1681(a)(8) (emphasis added); and  \nc.  Scholarships associated with participation in a beauty pageant “limited \nto individuals of one sex only,” id. 1681(a)(9) (emphasis added). \n29.  Title IX’s explicit exclusions for sex-organizations further underscore \nthat understanding.  See, e.g., id. 1681(a)(6) (excluding membership practices of \n10 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 11 of 62 PageID #: 11\n \ncollege fraternities and sororities or to those of sex-segregated voluntary service \norganizations); id. 1681(a)(7) (excluding Boys and Girls State and Boys and Girls \nNation). \n30.  Title IX’s treatment of sex as a male-female binary reflects the ordinary \nunderstanding of “sex” when the statute was passed.  After all, “[t]he phrase ‘gender \nidentity’  did  not  exist”  in  1972  “outside  of  some  esoteric  psychological \npublications.”  Ryan T. Anderson & Melody Wood, Gender Identity Policies in \nSchools: What Congress, the Courts, and the Trump Administration Should Do, at \n9, The Heritage Found. (2017), https://perma.cc/VG5N-ZAYE. \nB.  Early regulations implementing Title IX. \n31.  The  Department’s  predecessor  agency  first  issued  regulations \nimplementing Title IX in 1975.  See 34 C.F.R. pt. 106.  These regulations treated \nsex as a binary, referring multiple times to “one sex,” especially versus “the other \nsex,” using the phrase “both sexes,” and referencing “boys and girls” and “male and \nfemale teams.”  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. 106.33, 106.34(a)(3), 106.36(c), 106.37(a)(3), \n106.41(c), 106.51(a)(4), 106.58(a), 106.60(b), 106.61; see also 34 C.F.R. pt. 86 \n(1975). \n32.  Consistent with Title IX’s structure, the regulations also preserved \ncertain sex-separated spaces.  These allowed recipients of federal funding to: \na.  “provide separate housing on the basis of sex,” id. 106.32(b)(1);  \n11 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 12 of 62 PageID #: 12\n \nb.  “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis \nof sex,” id. 106.33;  \nc.  conduct “separate sessions for boys and girls” of sexual-education \nclasses in elementary and secondary schools, id. 106.34(a)(3);  \nd.  and “make requirements based on vocal range or quality which may \nresult in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex,” id. \n106.34(a)(4). \n33.  The  original  regulations  likewise  approved  of  sex  separation  in \nathletics in certain circumstances.  The regulations prohibited discrimination “on the \nbasis of sex” in “interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics” but \nallowed a recipient to sponsor “separate teams for members of each sex” when team \nselection is “based upon competitive skill” or the sport is a “contact sport.”  Id. \n106.41(a)-(b).  The regulations further recognized that sex differentiation in athletics \ndoes  not  necessarily  constitute  sex  discrimination,  and  in  fact  the  failure  to \ndifferentiate can amount to sex discrimination.  The rules required “equal athletic \nopportunity for members of both sexes,” including in the distribution of athletic \nscholarships and the provision of facilities, equipment, and services, but provided \nthat “aggregate expenditures for members of each sex” and “expenditures for male \nand female teams” need not necessarily be equal to comply with Title IX.  Id. \n106.41(c); see also id. 106.37(c). \n12 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 13 of 62 PageID #: 13\n \n34.  The Department consistently interpreted “sex” as a binary male/female \nclassification over the next decades.  For example, in 1997 guidance clarifying that \nTitle IX covers same-sex sexual harassment, the Department stated, “both male and \nfemale students are protected from sexual harassment . . . even if the harasser and \nthe person being harassed are members of the same sex.”  Sexual Harassment \nGuidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third \nParties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034, 12,039 (Mar. 13, 1997), https://perma.cc/AT7Y-\nKCFC.  That same guidance stated that “Title IX does not prohibit discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation,” because—as the Department then correctly \nrecognized—“sex” refers to the status of being male or female, not that of having a \nheterosexual or homosexual orientation or based on “gender identity.”  Id.; see also \nid. at 12,036. \n35.  In stark contrast to that long established reading, in 2014, President \nObama’s Department of Education suddenly attempted to radically redefine sex and \nrecast Title IX as a regulation about gender identity, rather than sex.  It did so first \nvia a “Dear Colleague” letter asserting—for the first time—that “Title IX’s sex \ndiscrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination” based solely on \n“gender identity.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Questions and Answers \non  Title  IX  and  Sexual  Violence,  at  5  (Apr.  29,  2014)  (rescinded  in  2017), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y7BD-XHFU.    \n13 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 14 of 62 PageID #: 14\n \n36.  Then,  in  2016,  President  Obama’s  Department  went  still  further, \nissuing guidance claiming that, Title IX “encompasses discrimination based on a \nstudent’s gender identity, including discrimination based on a student’s transgender \nstatus.”  U.S. Dep’t of Just. & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague \nLetter on Title IX and Transgender Students, at 1 (May 13, 2016) (rescinded in \n2017)  (“2016  Guidance”),  https://perma.cc/G5VG-ZNV9.    The  2016  Guidance \nclaimed that failing to “treat students consistent with their gender identity” would \nconstitute  sex  discrimination,  even  where  a  student’s  claimed  gender  identity \ndiffered from their sex.  Id. at 3.  And it suggested funding recipients were required \nto compel their faculty and staff to “use pronouns and names consistent with a \ntransgender student’s gender identity” and must permit access to previously sex-\nseparated restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, housing, and sports based \nsolely on a student’s proclaimed gender identity.  Id. at 3-4. \n37.  The Obama Administration’s foray into gender-identity-based Title IX \nregulations was swiftly enjoined by the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Texas, which concluded the 2016 Guidance was likely contrary to law.  \nSee Texas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 816 n.4, 836 (N.D. Tex. 2016), \nclarified by No. 7:16-cv-00054-O, 2016 WL 7852331 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2016).  \nThe Department subsequently withdrew its unlawful gender-identity guidance, see \ninfra at ¶ 39, and that lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed.  See Pls.’ Notice of \n14 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 15 of 62 PageID #: 15\n \nVoluntary Dismissal, Texas v. United States, No. 7:16-cv-00054-O (N.D. Tex. Mar. \n3, 2017), ECF No. 128.  \n38.  The Obama Administration’s unlawful gender-identity guidance also \nspurred litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia.  A transgender-identifying high-school student relied on that guidance in \narguing that a school policy requiring students’ to use the bathroom associated with \ntheir sex, rather than their self-expressed gender identity, violated Title IX.  After \nthe Fourth Circuit held that the Obama Administration’s guidance was entitled to \nAuer deference, G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709 (4th \nCir. 2016), vacated and remanded, 580 U.S. 1168 (2017), and the district court \nentered an injunction against the school board on remand requiring it to allow the \nplaintiff to use the bathroom associated with the plaintiff’s self-professed gender \nidentity, G.G. v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., No. 4:15CV54, 2016 WL 3581852, at \n*1 (E.D. Va. June 23, 2016), vacated, 853 F.3d 729 (4th Cir. 2017), as amended \n(Apr. 18, 2017), the Supreme Court stayed the injunction, Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd. \nv. G.G. ex rel.

After the Department withdrew its unlawful Title \nIX guidance, the Supreme Court vacated the Fourth Circuit’s decision and remanded \n15 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 16 of 62 PageID #: 16\n \nfor further proceedings.

The Trump Administration withdrew the Department’s gender-identity \nguidance in February 2017, returning to the pre-2014 understanding that Title IX’s \nprohibition on sex-based discrimination means “sex,” not gender identity.

In 2020, the Department further amended its regulations to clarify the \ndefinition  of  “sexual  harassment”  for  purposes  of  Title  IX  enforcement.    See \nNondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or  Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial  Assistance, 85  Fed.  Reg. 30,026  (May 19, 2020) \n(“2020  Rule”).    The  Department  adopted  the  Supreme  Court’s  definition  of \nharassment in Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education, \n526 U.S. 629 (1999), that is, “conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively \noffensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.”  2020 Rule, \n85 Fed. Reg. at 30,036.   \n41.  The Department explained that this standard was appropriate in the \neducation context because it would capture “serious situations” while accounting \nfor the fact that “younger students are still learning social skills and older students \n16 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 17 of 62 PageID #: 17\n \nbenefit  from  robust  exchange  of  ideas,  opinions,  and  beliefs.”    Id.  at  30,143.  \nMoreover, the Department explained that “narrowly tailored” definition of hostile-\nenvironment harassment was necessary to ensure that Title IX is applied “in a \nmanner consistent with respect for First Amendment rights, and principles of free \nspeech and academic freedom, in education programs and activities.”  Id. at 30,142.  \n42.  A month after the Department issued its 2020 Rule, the Supreme Court \ndecided Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  Bostock held that Title VII’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination bars an employer from firing an employee based \non  sexual  orientation  or  transgender  status.    Id.  at  651-52.    In  reaching  that \nconclusion,  Bostock  interpreted  Title  VII’s  language  prohibiting  discrimination \n“because of” sex as a but-for causation standard, meaning that “[s]o long as the \nplaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of” an adverse employment action Title VII’s \ncoverage  is  triggered.    Id.  at  656,  659.    And  it  concluded that  “sex plays  an \nunmistakable and impermissible role in [a] discharge decision” based on sexual \norientation or transgender status.  Id. at 660.  That is because an employer who fires \na male employee “for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men . . . \ndiscriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague”; \nsimilarly, an employer who fires a male who adopts a transgender identity as a \nfemale “intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or \nactions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth.”  Id.   \n17 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 18 of 62 PageID #: 18\n \n43.  As relevant here, however, Bostock assumed that “sex” as used in Title \nVII in 1964 referred “only to the biological distinctions between male and female.”  \nId. at 655.  And it expressly declined to “prejudge” whether its decision would \n“sweep beyond Title VII” to other statutes such as Title IX, or whether enforcing \n“sex-segregated  bathrooms,  locker  rooms,  and  dress  codes”  would  constitute \ndiscrimination under Title VII.  Id. at 681.  Finally, the Court did not consider what \nTitle IX’s different language—“on the basis of sex”—means in the context of \ndiscrimination. \n44.  Following Bostock, some lower courts sought to expand the scope of \nother statutory sex-based provisions, including Title IX.  See, e.g., Adams ex rel. \nKasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 968 F.3d 1286, 1305 (11th Cir. 2020), rev’d \non reh’g en banc, 57 F.4th 791 (holding, prior to the Eleventh Circuit holding the \nopposite on rehearing en banc, that “Title IX, like Title VII, prohibits discrimination \nagainst a person because he is transgender, because this constitutes discrimination \nbased on sex”); see also Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, No. 21-2875, 2022 WL \n16957734, at *1 n.1 (8th Cir. Nov. 16, 2022) (Stras, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing) (explaining that “there is reason to be skeptical that” the Equal Protection \nClause’s “protections reach” as far as Title VII, given that “their text is not similar \nin any way”). \n18 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 19 of 62 PageID #: 19\n \n45.  The Department’s Office of the General Counsel disagreed with the \nview of those few lower courts that Bostock’s reasoning applied to Title IX.  Instead, \nit stated in a 2021 memorandum that the “Department’s longstanding construction \nof  the  term  ‘sex’  in  Title  IX  [is]  biological  sex,  male  or  female.”    Reed  D. \nRubinstein, Memorandum For Kimberly M. Richey, Acting Assistant Secretary of \nthe Office for Civil Rights, re: Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (Jan. \n8, 2021), https://perma.cc/Q9YC-Q4Y2.  Moreover, “sex” as “biological sex” is \n“the only construction consistent with the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ at the \ntime of Title IX’s enactment.”  Id. at 1-4.  Finally, the memorandum determined that \ngiving “sex” its ordinary meaning not only permits but requires a Title IX recipient \nproviding “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities” or “separate athletic \nteams” to regulate entry based on sex, rather than gender identity.  Id. at 7, 9. \nD.  2021 interpretation of “sex” in Title IX. \n46.  Soon  after  taking  office,  the  Biden  administration  reversed  that \nestablished, reasoned understanding.  President Biden issued an executive order \ndeclaring that Bostock applied across all federal law, arguing that,  “Under Bostock’s \nreasoning,  laws  that  prohibit  sex  discrimination—including  Title  IX  of  the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), . . .  along \nwith  their  respective  implementing  regulations—prohibit  discrimination  on  the \nbasis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain \n19 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 20 of 62 PageID #: 20\n \nsufficient indications to the contrary.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,023, \n7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  Every federal agency was directed to review its existing \nregulations and develop a plan to align them with the executive order.  Id. at 7,024. \n47.  Following  that  directive,  the  Department  published  in  June  2021 \nguidance in which it “interpret[ed] Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination ‘on the \nbasis of sex’ to encompass discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and \ngender identity.”  Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \nWith Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity \nin Light of Bostock v. Clayton County.  86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“2021 \nGuidance”). \n48.  The Department interpreted the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX \nas having the same meaning as the phrase “because of . . . sex” in Title VII. Id. at \n32,638-39.  It claimed that this interpretation “is most consistent with the purpose \nof Title IX”—“ensur[ing] equal opportunity and . . . protect[ing] individuals from \nthe harms of sex discrimination.”  Id. at 32,639.  This was swiftly followed by other \nguidance documents explaining that the Department planned to “fully enforce Title \nIX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in \neducation programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the \nDepartment.”  Suzanne B. Goldberg, Dear Educator letter on Confronting Anti-\n20 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 21 of 62 PageID #: 21\n \nLGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools, at 2 (June 23, 2021), https://perma.cc/A759-\nWKR9. \n49.  Like the 2016 Guidance, the 2021 Guidance was quickly enjoined.  \nTennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 842 (E.D. Tenn. 2022).  That \ninjunction prevented the Department from enforcing the 2021 Guidance as to the \n20-State plaintiff coalition.  That court concluded that it was likely the Biden \nadministration acted unlawfully by “creat[ing] new rights and obligations” without \ncomplying with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  Id. at 838.  The court \nidentified two reasons why the 2021 Guidance “plausibly ‘adopt[s] a new position \ninconsistent with . . . [the Department’s] existing regulations.”  Id. at 839.  First, \n“Title  IX  does  allow  for  sex-separation  in  certain  circumstances,”  but  “the \nDepartment’s guidance . . .  appears to suggest such conduct will be investigated as \nunlawful discrimination.”  Id.  Second, the guidance “creates rights for students and \nobligations for regulated entities not to discriminate based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity that appear nowhere in Bostock, Title IX, or its implementing \nregulations.”  Id.  That injunction remains in effect today. \nE.  2022 proposed Title IX rule redefining “sex.” \n50.  In July 2022, the Department proposed amendments to its Title IX \nregulations that incorporated its previous guidance documents’ atextual reading of \nTitle IX.  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking re: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex \n21 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 22 of 62 PageID #: 22\n \nin Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 \nFed. Reg. 41,390 (proposed July 12, 2022) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106).  The \nproposed rule defined sex discrimination under Title IX to “include[] discrimination \non the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, \nsexual orientation, and gender identity.”  Id. at 41,571 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. \n106.10).   \n51.  The proposed rule stated that, even where Title IX authorizes “different \ntreatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must not carry out such \ndifferent treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex \nby subjecting a person to more than de minimis harm, unless otherwise permitted \nby Title IX or this part.”  Id. (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. 106.31(a)(2)).  The \nDepartment further explained that “subject[ing] a person to more than de minimis \nharm on the basis of sex” would include “[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a \npractice that prevents a person from participating in an education program or activity \nconsistent with the person’s gender identity.”  Id. \n52.  The proposed rule required a recipient to “take prompt and effective \naction to end any sex discrimination that has occurred in its education program or \nactivity, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.”  Id. at 41,572 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. 106.41(a)).   \n22 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 23 of 62 PageID #: 23\n \n53.  This new definition of sex discrimination also affected the revised \ndefinition  of  harassment.    Previous  Title  IX  regulations  targeted  “sexual \nharassment,” which included (in relevant part) “unwelcome conduct determined by \na reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \neffectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or \nactivity.”  Id. at 41,410.  The proposed rule broadened Title IX’s coverage to “sex-\nbased harassment,” defined to include “unwelcome sex-based conduct.”  Id.  This \nexpansion targeted “all forms of sex-based harassment, as opposed to only sexual \nharassment,” including harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  \nId.  \n54.  The  proposed  rule  also  sought  to  “make  clear”  that  its  Title  IX \nregulations “would preempt” “any State or local law” conflicting with them.  Id. at \n41,404; see also id. at 41,569 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. 106.6(b)). \n55.  This  rule  purported  to  decline  to  address  athletics,  citing  “a \nlongstanding congressional view that athletics presents unique considerations,” Id. \nat 41,537-38, and instead stated that the Department planned to address those issues \nin a separate rule. \n56.  A  20-state  coalition,  including  many  of  the  Plaintiff  States,  filed \ncomments opposing the proposed rule.  The States argued that interpreting “sex” to \nmean “gender identity” contravenes Title IX’s text, structure, and purpose, as well \n23 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 24 of 62 PageID #: 24\n \nas longstanding Department regulations and practice.  The States also argued that \nthe proposed rule would exceed Congress’s Spending Clause authority; run afoul of \nthe First Amendment by requiring colleges to compel speech; and potentially violate \nparental rights by forcing a school to accommodate a child’s expressed gender \nidentity without parental consent.   \n57.  The States further explained that the Department’s proposed rule failed \nto address important policy considerations.  For example, the States explained that \nthe Department had failed to consider the difficulty of even determining each \nstudent’s gender identity in order to administer the proposed rule, given that gender \nidentity is defined as a completely internal sense of self, which can change.  The \nproposed rule also did not adequately address safety concerns related to the effective \nelimination  of  sex-separated  spaces  such  as  locker  rooms,  restrooms,  and \ndormitories.  The States pointed out the potential for voyeurism, harassment, and \neven violent crime due to allowing males into previously female-only spaces.  These \nconcerns are most poignant in spaces frequented by vulnerable children.  Finally, \nthe proposed rule failed to account for the harms incurred by female students, the \nprimary intended beneficiaries of Title IX, from allowing males to participate in sex-\nseparated activities as females simply by claiming a different gender identity. \n24 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 25 of 62 PageID #: 25\n \nF.  2023 proposed Title IX rule relating to athletics. \n58.  The next year, the Biden Administration proposed another rule related \nto Title IX, this time addressing how its new interpretation of sex would be applied \nto athletics.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (proposed Apr. 13, 2023) (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. pt. 106).  The proposed rule provided that:  \nIf a recipient adopts or applies sex-related criteria that would limit or \ndeny a student’s eligibility to participate on a male or female team \nconsistent with their gender identity, such criteria must, for each sport, \nlevel of competition, and grade or education level: (i) Be substantially \nrelated to the achievement of an important educational objective; and \n(ii) Minimize harms to students whose opportunity to participate on a \nmale or female team consistent with their gender identity would be \nlimited or denied. \n \nId. at 22,891 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. 106.41). \n \n59.  The  Department  offered  two  examples  of  “important  educational \nobjective[s]” that may qualify under the rule: “ensuring fairness in competition and \nprevention of sports-related injury.”  Id. at 22,872.  But the Department cautioned \nthat even these objectives would not pass muster unless they were “substantially \nrelated to ensuring fairness in competition in [a] particular sport at the applicable \nlevel of competition and grade or educational level.”  Id. at 22,873.  Indeed, the \nDepartment stressed that even criteria that were “substantially related” to achieving \nan “important governmental objective” would violate the proposed sports rule if the \nfunding recipient “c[ould] reasonably adopt or apply alternative criteria that would \n25 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 26 of 62 PageID #: 26\n \nbe  a  less  harmful  means  of  achieving  the  recipient’s  important  educational \nobjective.”  Id. at 22,877.   \n60.  The  Department  admitted  that  “few,  if  any,  sex-related  eligibility \ncriteria” would be able to surmount this high hurdle for elementary and middle \nschool students.  Id. at 22,860, 22,875.  Such criteria at the high school level would \nonly be “more likely” to satisfy the proposed rule.  Id. at 22,875. \n61.  Arkansas,  along  with  eighteen  other  States,  submitted  comments \nraising  several  concerns  with  the  proposed  athletics  rule.    First,  as  Arkansas \nexplained, the Department was placing an unlawful premium on affirming the \nprofessed gender identities of students, over and above real harms to female athletes \nwhich would predictably occur due to physical differences between boys and girls.  \nSee Ark. Comment Letter at 2-6 (May 15, 2023) https://perma.cc/GB2A-CQKK.  \nSecond, Arkansas explained that the athletics proposal is “self-contradictory and \nutterly  un-administerable”  because  it  requires  the  use  of  self-identified  gender \nidentity to assess athletic performance in a case-by-case assessment with no clear \nstandards or methodology.  Id. at 6-7.  Indeed, the murkiness of the standard is \napparently a design feature of the proposed rule, placing a thumb on the scale in \nfavor of deferring to a student’s claimed gender identity in all cases.  Id.  Finally, \nArkansas pointed out that the proposed athletics rule misinterpreted both Title IX \nand the Constitution.  Id. at 8-12. \n26 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 27 of 62 PageID #: 27\n \n62.  Many  other  commentors  presented  similar  concerns.    Alliance \nDefending Freedom argued, for example, that the major-questions doctrine and the \n“federalism clear-notice canon” indicate the Department lacked authority for the \nproposed athletics rule.  ADF Athletics Comment Letter at 6-8 (May 15, 2023) \nhttps://perma.cc/W846-9EMS.  \nG.  The Final Rule. \n63.  On  April  29,  2024,  the  Department  published  the  Final  Rule.  \nNondiscrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Sex  in  Education  Programs  or  Activities \nReceiving Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024).  The Final \nRule dramatically and unlawfully reshapes Title IX in two primary ways.  First, it \nredefines what constitutes sex discrimination.  Second, it broadens the definition of \nprohibited “harassment.”  \nRedefining sex discrimination \n64.  The Final Rule redefines Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination \nto  include  “discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  stereotypes,  sex  characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  Id. (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. 106.10).  The Final Rule purports to preempt all “State or local \nlaws or other requirements” that conflict with its terms, id. at 33,885, and it applies \nto any school “program or activity” regardless of whether the activity occurs within \n27 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 28 of 62 PageID #: 28\n \nthe school—or even within the United States. Id. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 \nC.F.R. 106.11). \n65.  In setting out how this new definition of sex discrimination must be \nimplemented, the Department begins by instructing that schools are permitted to \nmaintain certain sex-segregated programs, activities, and facilities.  Id. at 33,814.  \nBut  the  Department  then  says  that  schools  cannot  enforce  these  sex-based \ndistinctions in a way that “causes . . . more than de minimis harm.”  Id. at 33,814, \n33,816 (citing amended 34 C.F.R. 106.31(a)).   And the Final Rule explains that it \nnecessarily inflicts more than de minimis harm—and thus violates Title IX—to \nprohibit  any  “‘person’”  from  “‘participating  in  .  .  .  education  program[s  and] \nactivit[ies] consistent with [the person’s] gender identity,’” except as “otherwise \npermitted by Title IX or [the Title IX regulations].”  Id. at 33,816, 33,819-20 \n(quoting amended 34 C.F.R. 106.31(a)). \n66.  The Final Rule thus threatens to withhold federal funding from schools \nthat do not allow students access to “restrooms and locker rooms” based on their \npurported gender identity or that have “appearance codes (including dress and \ngrooming codes)” rooted in biological sex.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816.  \nIndeed,  under  the  Final  Rule,  a  funding  recipient  would  violate  Title  IX’s \nnondiscrimination prohibition by denying a transgender-identifying student access \nto a bathroom or locker room of the opposite sex.  See, e.g., id. at 33,818.   \n28 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 29 of 62 PageID #: 29\n \n67.  Additionally, the Final Rule states that it inflicts “more than de minimis \nharm” on students to even inquire into or seek confirmation of a student’s gender \nidentity.  Id. at 33,819.  In other words, a school cannot require documentary \nevidence  of  diagnosed  gender  dysphoria  or  another  gender-based  condition  to \npermit participation in or use of a sex-separate activity or facility.  Id.  A funding \nrecipient thus violates the Final Rule’s interpretation of sex discrimination if it even \ntries to verify the access of those using facilities like an elementary or secondary \nschool girls’ bathroom or locker room.  Id. at 33,818-19. \nBroadening the definition of harassment \n68.  The Final Rule follows through on the proposed rule’s approach to \nlower the standard for sexual harassment.  The Final Rule jettisons the 2020 Rule’s \ninterpretation that had incorporated the Supreme Court’s standard in Davis. See \nsupra ¶¶ 40-41.   \n69.  The Final Rule instead says that “[s]ex-based harassment, including \nharassment predicated on sex stereotyping or gender identity, is covered by Title IX \nif  it  is  sex-based,  unwelcome,  subjectively  and  objectively  offensive,  and \nsufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny a student’s ability to participate in \nor benefit from a recipient’s education program or activity,”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516 \n(emphasis added), rather than both “severe” and “pervasive” as Davis requires.  This \n29 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 30 of 62 PageID #: 30\n \nmeans that even a “single serious” instance of unwelcome speech, or a pattern of \nnon-severe incidents, might qualify.  Id. \n70.  The Final Rule also expands the definition of harassment to cover \nconduct  that  is  “subjectively  and  objectively”  offensive  measured  from  “the \ncomplainant’s  position.”    Id.  at  33,510.    For  example,  whether  referring  to  a \ntransgender-identifying male using male pronouns instead of female pronouns is \n“subjectively and objectively offensive” must be measured from the transgender-\nidentifying male’s point of view.   \n71.  The Final Rule also waters down the standard from what “limits” a \nperson’s “ability to participate” in an educational program or activity—requiring \nonly “some impact” on a student’s ability to participate, without any “particular \nlimits or denials.”  Id. at 33,511. \n72.  The Final Rule is such a dramatic departure from established Title IX \npractices and prior legal consensus that it is difficult to summarize its full impact.  \nHowever, a few things are clear.  No State or recipient school can exclude a student \nfrom using the bathroom, locker room, or other private changing or showering space \nthat aligns with that student’s self-professed gender identity (which they cannot \nattempt to authenticate), no matter the student’s sex.  And though the Final Rule \npurports to leave considerations about athletics for a different rulemaking, it is clear \nthat  States  cannot  maintain  laws  that  require  eligibility  for  sports  teams  and \n30 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 31 of 62 PageID #: 31\n \ncompetition to be based on an athlete’s sex.  Finally, State laws that protect the rights \nof teachers and students to speak about gender and gender identity in ways that a \nstudent might view as offensive will be preempted. \n73.  The Final Rule is set to take effect on August 1, 2024, prior to the \nbeginning of the next school year.  Id. at 33,474.    \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ impending irreparable harm   \n74.  The Final Rule, if allowed to go into effect, will impose significant \nirreparable harms on Plaintiffs.   \nHarms to Plaintiff States \n75.  Each  of  the  Plaintiff  States  takes  federal  funds  for  educational \nprograms and activities, subjecting them to Title IX’s requirements.  See 89 Fed. \nReg.  at  33,541  (“[A]ll  50  States  have  accepted  Federal  funding  for  education \nprograms  or  activities  and  are  subject  to  Title  IX  as  to  those  programs  and \nactivities.”).   \n76.  If the Final Rule goes into effect, Plaintiff States would suffer the \n“irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”  Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th \n545, 556 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in the judgment)); cf. Kentucky v. \nFed. Highway Admin., No. 5:23-cv-162-BJB, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2024 WL 1402443, \n31 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 32 of 62 PageID #: 32\n \nat *3 (W.D. Ky.

The Final Rule acknowledges that 106.32(1)(2) would require schools \nthat do not already have policies requiring treatment of students on the basis of \ngender identity rather than sex to incur costs related to “review” of current policies, \n“updating of policies or training materials,” and “train[ing] of employees or students \non gender identity discrimination.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,876.  Indeed, the Department \nestimates that simply “reading and understanding the final regulations” will impose \na one-time cost of more than $24 million across all recipients.  Id. at 33,867.  Given \nthe government’s sovereign immunity, these costs are not recoverable.  See Ala. \nAss’n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. 758, 765 (2021) (“no guarantee of eventual \nrecovery” of monies owed was irreparable harm). \n78.  Enforcement of the Final Rule threatens to strip Plaintiff States of \nbillions of dollars in federal funding and subject them to liability through private \nsuits.   That lack of funding would  threaten  Plaintiff  States’ ability to provide \neducational programs to their citizens and the harm to children and others across \nPlaintiff States would be irreparable.  \n79.

The  Rule  accordingly  could  deprive  Plaintiff  States  and  their \neducational systems of billions of dollars in crucial federal funding.  The education \ninstitutions for which Plaintiffs States are responsible, and the children who rely on \nthose institutions, will be irreparably harmed if they lose funding because of their \nreliance on a half-century of Title IX practice and legal precedent interpreting “sex” \nto mean biological sex.  \n91.  In addition to hurting the Plaintiffs’ financial interests, the Rule also \nharms the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests, including by interfering with their \n36 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 37 of 62 PageID #: 37\n \nauthority over education in their State, their democratically enacted laws, and their \nfuture ability to legislate.

Arkansas’s  Fairness  in  Women’s  Sports  Act  requires  elementary, \nsecondary, and collegiate sports teams and competitions to be expressly designated \nas (1) for males, (2) for females, or (3) coed.  Ark. Code Ann. 6-1-107(c).  The Act \nmakes clear that any sex separation must be based on “biological sex,” not gender \nidentity.  Id.  And it prohibits female-designated sports teams from being open to \nthose of the male sex.  Id. -107(c)(2)(B).   \n93.  Missouri law generally prohibits schools from allowing “any student \nto compete in an athletics competition that is designated for the biological sex \n37 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 38 of 62 PageID #: 38\n \nopposite to the student's biological sex as correctly stated on the student's official \nbirth certificate.”   Mo. Rev. Stat. 163.048(3).  However, if the only available \ncompetition is male-designated, the statute allows females to participate.  Id. \n94.  Iowa law similarly requires school sports teams to be designated as (1) \nfor females, (2) for males, or (c) coeducational.  Iowa Code 261I.2.  That designation \nmust be based on biological sex, not gender identity.  Iowa Code 261I.1(3).  And \nonly females may play on female-designated sports teams or competitions.  Iowa \nCode 261I.2(1)(b).   \n95.  North Dakota law requires school sports teams and activities to be \ndesignated based on the participants’ sex as (1) for males, (2) for females, or (3) \ncoed.  N.D.C.C. 15-10.6-02.  “Sex” is defined as “the biological state of being \nfemale or male.”  N.D.C.C. 15-10.6-01.  Athletic teams designated for females may \nnot be open to males.  Id . N.D.C.C 15-10.6-03. \n96.  South Dakota law requires sports teams and activities to be designated \nbased on the participants’ sex as (1) for males, (2) for females, or (3) coed.  S.D.C.L. \n13-67-1.  “Sex” is defined as “biological sex” for purposes of South Dakota’s law.  \nId.  “Only female students, based on their biological sex, may participate” in female-\ndesignated athletic teams or competitions.  Id. \n97.  School athletics plainly qualify as a “program or activity” subject to \nthe face of the Final Rule’s gender-identity infused sex discrimination approach.  \n38 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 39 of 62 PageID #: 39\n \nWhile the Final Rule purports to reserve the ultimate criteria the Department will \nuse to judge sex separation in sports, the Rule notes that “athletic competition raises \nunique considerations” that warrant “impos[ing] more than de minimis harm on \nindividual students” in certain circumstances.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,817, 33,819.  Of \ncourse, by acknowledging that sex separation will (at best) be warranted only \nsometimes, the Final Rule gives the game away that wholesale prohibitions on male \nparticipation in female-designated sports teams and competitions will be preempted \nby the Final Rule.  Indeed, the Department of Justice has recently confirmed this \nposition in the B.P.J. litigation in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.  See Br. for the United States as Amicus Curiae, at 27-28, B.P.J. by Jackson \nv. W. Va.

Thus, Plaintiff States’ will be forced to choose between enforcing their \nsports laws or running afoul of the Final Rule’s interpretation of sex discrimination. \n \n2 Available at https://www.justice.gov/d9/case-\ndocuments/attachments/2023/04/03/b.p.j._v._west_va_state_bd_of_educ._nos._23-1078_23-\n1130_4th_cir._04.03.23.pdf \n39 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 40 of 62 PageID #: 40\n \n99.  Arkansas’s Given Name Act was enacted to protect the freedom of \nspeech and expression of school faculty and students, and to protect the rights of \nparents.   It prohibits  a  school employee  from  addressing  a student with  (1) a \n“[p]ronoun or title that is inconsistent” with the student’s “biological sex”; or (2) a \n“[n]ame other than the name listed on the . . . student’s birth certificate” or a \nderivative of that name, unless the school employee “has the written permission” of \nthe student’s parent.  Ark. Code Ann. 6-1-108(d)(1).  The Act further provides that \nschool employees and students shall not be sanctioned for declining to address a \nperson by (1) a name other than that on the person’s birth certificate, or (2) a \n“[p]ronoun  or title that is  inconsistent with  the person’s  biological sex.    Id.  -\n108(d)(2).   \n100.  North Dakota law provides that “a government entity may not adopt a \npolicy requiring or prohibiting” “[a]n employee's use of an individual’s preferred \npronoun  when  addressing  or  mentioning  the  individual  in  work-related \ncommunications.”  N.D.C.C. 14-02.4-15.2(1).  \n101.  The Final Rule would subject State and local entities to liability for \nsex-based harassment unless they require their employees to use pronouns attributed \nto the student’s self-professed gender identity instead of according to the student’s \nsex.  Thus, these States’ laws cannot be enforced without running afoul of the Final \nRule’s interpretation of Title IX. \n40 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 41 of 62 PageID #: 41\n \n102.  The Final Rule would also risk subjecting local entities to damages and \nfees under 28 U.S.C. 1983 and 1988. Requiring employees to use an individual’s \npreferred pronoun is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment absent \nthe government satisfying heightened scrutiny.  See Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d \n492, 506 (6th Cir. 2021); see also Beard v. Falkenrath, 97 F.4th 1109, 1117 (8th \nCir. 2024) (no First Amendment right to have prison guards use your preferred \npronouns). \n103.  Arkansas law provides that public schools sponsoring or supervising \nan overnight trip involving students must ensure that students only share sleeping \nquarters with those of the same sex.  Ark. Code Ann. 6-10-137(a).  The Final Rule \nwould preempt this law and require public schools to assign overnight sleeping \nquarters based on a student’s professed gender identity rather than sex. \n104.  Arkansas law requires public schools to designate multiple occupancy \nrestrooms  based  on  biological  sex.    Multiple  occupancy  restrooms  must  be \ndesignated for the “exclusive use by the male sex” or the “exclusive use by the \nfemale sex.”  Ark. Code Ann. 6-21-120(b)(1).   \n105.  Iowa law requires that schools “require a multiple occupancy restroom \nor changing area to be designated only for and use by persons of the same sex” and \nprohibits an individual from entering one of those areas “that does not correspond \n41 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 42 of 62 PageID #: 42\n \nwith the person’s sex.”  Iowa Code 280.33(2).  “Sex” under Iowa law “means a \nperson’s biological sex as female or male.”  Id. -280.33(1)(b).   \n106.  Nebraska  law  allows  school  districts  to  “maintain[]  separate  toilet \nfacilities, locker rooms, or living facilities for the different sexes.” Neb. Rev. Stat. \n79-2,124.  Governor Pillen of Nebraska has established through executive order a \nWomen’s Bill of Rights requiring “all state agencies, boards, and commissions” in \nrulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication to define a person’s sex “as his or her \nbiological sex.” The order further requires that “[a]ny public school or school district \n. . . that collects vital statistics for the purpose of complying with antidiscrimination \nlaws . . . shall identify each individual who is part of the collected data set as either \nmale or female at birth.” Neb. Exec. Order. No. 23-16 (Aug. 30, 2023).3  \n107.  North Dakota public universities must designate dormitory restrooms \nand showers as “exclusively for males or exclusively for females.”  N.D.C.C. 15-\n10-68(1).  North Dakota law requires that sex-designated restrooms and showers \n“may only be used by members of that sex.”  Id. -68(2). \n108.  The Final Rule preempts these laws and would require schools to allow \nstudents to use multiple occupancy restrooms based on the student’s professed \ngender identity rather than the student’s sex. \n \n3 Available at https://governor.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/doc/press/EO%20No.%2023-\n16%20-%20Establishing%20a%20Women%27s%20Bill%20of%20Rights.pdf. \n42 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 43 of 62 PageID #: 43\n \nHarms to Plaintiff A.F. \n109.  A.F. attends a public high school in Arkansas that is a recipient of \nfederal funds and is therefore subject to Title IX.  If the Final Rule is allowed to go \ninto effect, it will erase existing legal protections for female students and subject her \nto irreparable harms in numerous aspects of her school life. \n110.  If the Final Rule goes into effect, A.F. may be forced to choose between \nfollowing her religious beliefs or facing sanction from school officials.  She believes \nas a Christian that God created humans as immutably either male or female.  She \ndoes not use pronouns or titles inconsistent with a person’s sex and denies that a \nperson’s belief that they are male or female, or desire to be a male or female, makes \nthem male or female.  A.F. also expresses her views about gender identity at school \nwith her classmates and coaches by, for example, explaining that men who identify \nas women are in fact men and should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports.  \nBut come August 1, A.F. fears she will be punished for expressing these views at \nher school and will be less vocal and more hesitant to speak these views to avoid \npunishment until she knows she can do so without being punished. \n111.  Under  the  Religious  Viewpoint  Antidiscrimination  Act,  Arkansas \npublic schools are prohibited from discriminating against students’ expressions of \nreligious  viewpoints,  even  if  other  students  are  offended  by  that  religious \nexpression.  Ark. Code Ann. 6-10-137.  A.F. is thus protected against adverse action \n43 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 44 of 62 PageID #: 44\n \nby her school when she expresses religious viewpoints regarding sex and gender, \nincluding using sex-consistent titles and pronouns when addressing and referring to \nother students.   \n112.  If  the  Final  Rule  takes  effect,  A.F.’s  school  will  be  required  to \ninvestigate and respond to instances of what the Final Rule defines as “sex-based” \nharassment.  This includes the use of sex-consistent pronouns that offend another \nstudent, as measured from that other student’s point of view.  See supra ¶¶ 69-70 .  \nA.F. will thus face potential investigation and sanctions by her school when she \ncontinues to refer to students using pronouns consistent with the student’s sex, \nrefuses to affirm that other students’ professed gender identity determines whether \nthey are in fact male or female, or even discusses her religious views regarding sex \nand gender in a manner that another student is offended by. \n113.  If the Final Rule takes effect, A.F.’s school will face liability under \nTitle  IX  if  it  does  not  allow  male  students  into  previously  female-designated \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and shower areas.  Currently, Arkansas law prevents \nA.F.’s school from allowing males into these female-only spaces or allowing male \nstudents to share a room with female students on overnight trips.  This gives A.F. \nand other girls the assurance and comfort of knowing that males will not be allowed \ninto these sensitive spaces when they are using the restroom, changing clothes, and \nshowering.  The Final Rule will eviscerate that sense of safety and instead subject \n44 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 45 of 62 PageID #: 45\n \nA.F. and others to the deeply distressing and embarrassing reality that male students \nmay be present while they are changing clothes or showering.  This puts girls like \nA.F. to the choice of accepting the presence of males in these female-designated \nspaces or ceasing using school bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers altogether.    \n114.  A.F. has played in organized sports from a young age and currently \nplays on her school basketball team.  Athletics have played an important role in \nA.F.’s life and her development as a young person.  Participating in school sports \nhas helped her build a strong work ethic, kept her body health, taught her how to set \ngoals and achieve them, and taught her how to communicate well with others.  \nCompeting  in  sports  has  boosted  A.F.’s  self-confidence  and  helped  to  build \nleadership skills.  She anticipates continuing to compete in athletics on school teams \nin the years to come.   \n115.  Arkansas law currently prevents males from competing in female-\ndesignated  sports  teams.    This  means  that  A.F.  competes  against  only  female \nteammates for athletic opportunities such as starting positions and playing time.  \nWhen A.F.’s basketball team competes against teams from other Arkansas schools, \nthey compete only against other female students.   \n116.  Despite the Final Rule purporting to reserve the issue of athletics for a \ndifferent  rulemaking,  the  Final  Rule  clearly  prevents  funding  recipients  from \nenforcing blanket policies restricting males from competing in female-designated \n45 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 46 of 62 PageID #: 46\n \nsports teams and competitions.  See supra ¶¶ 97-98.  If the Final Rule takes effect, \nA.F. and other girls will be forced to compete alongside and against male athletes. \n117.  Males indisputably have physiological advantages over females when \nit comes to athletics.  It is unfair to require girls such as A.F. to compete in sports \nsuch as basketball against male athletes.  A.F.’s ability to compete in school sports \nwould be diminished if she were forced to compete with males for starting positions \nor playing time during games.  She and other girls risk being displaced from school \nathletics by physiologically advantaged males if the Final Rule goes into effect. \n118.  A.F. and other girls are at a greater risk of injury when competing \nagainst males due to the physiological advantages in size and strength that males \nhave over females.  These risks are not speculative.  Girls suffer knee and ankle \ninjuries playing basketball, and the risks of injuries only increase if girls are forced \nto play alongside and against male students.  \n   \n46 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 47 of 62 PageID #: 47\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCLAIM I  \n \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), (C)  \nThe Rule Exceeds Statutory Authority and Is Not in Accordance with Law \n \n119.

The Final \nRule relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock to recast Title IX and justify \nimposing standards, definitions, and requirements that conflict with Title IX’s text.   \nIndeed, the Final Rule does so despite Bostock’s express reservation that it was not \naddressing the meaning of sex discrimination outside of Title VII and differences \nbetween Title VII and Title IX that require different treatment.  \n124.  The text of Title IX allows recipients of federal funds to distinguish \nbetween males and females in situations that the Final Rule prohibits.   \n125.  Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” refers only \nto biological sex and does not include protections based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  By rewriting the statute to cover sexual orientation and gender \nidentity, the Department has exceeded its authority under the APA. \n126.  The use of “sex” in Title IX is not ambiguous and clearly refers to the \nmale/female binary of biological sex.  But even if it were an ambiguous term, the \nDepartment’s definition is not entitled to any deference because its reading falls \noutside of the range of reasonable interpretations of the statutory text.  Indeed, it \n48 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 49 of 62 PageID #: 49\n \npurports to resolve a policy issue of major political significance without clear \ncongressional authority.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721-25 (2022). \nContrary to Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n127.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 provides that the \n“Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if \nthe burden results from a rule of general applicability.”  42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a).  “If \nthe Government substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion, under the Act \nthat  person  is  entitled  to  an  exemption  from  the  rule  unless  the  Government \n“demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of \na  compelling  governmental  interest;  and  (2)  is  the  least  restrictive  means  of \nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc., 573 U.S. 682, 694–95 (2014).  RFRA applies to any “department or agency” \nof the United States, including the Department of Education.  42 U.S.C. 2000bb–\n2(1). \n128.  To the extent that the Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX would \nrequire students like A.F. to speak or use titles or pronouns in a manner that violates \ntheir religious beliefs, that would violate RFRA.  The Department has no compelling \ninterest in requiring such speech, and the Department’s construction of “sex-based” \nharassment is not the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. \n49 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 50 of 62 PageID #: 50\n \n129.  The Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX is contrary to the statutory \ntext,  the  Department’s  own  regulations,  and  RFRA.    The  Department’s \ninterpretation of Title IX is thus owed no deference and exceeds the agency’s \nauthority to implement Title IX.  The Final Rule should therefore be enjoined and \nultimately “set aside” on this basis.  5 U.S.C. 706(2).       \nCLAIM II \nViolation of U.S. Constitution and 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(B) \nThe Rule Is Contrary to the U.S. Constitution \n  \n130.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations. \n131.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is \n“contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”    5  U.S.C. \n706(2)(B) \n132.  The Final Rule is “contrary to [a] constitutional right [or] power,” 5 \nU.S.C. 706(2)(B), in at least three ways. \nSpending Clause \n133.  First, it  violates  the  Spending  Clause.   Congress  enacted Title  IX \npursuant to its powers under the Spending Clause.  Davis, 526 U.S. at 640 (“[W]e \nhave  repeatedly  treated  Title  IX  as  legislation  enacted  pursuant  to  Congress’ \nauthority under the Spending Clause[.]”).  If Congress intends to impose a condition \non the grant of federal funding under Title IX, it must do so with “a clear voice,” \n50 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 51 of 62 PageID #: 51\n \n“unambiguously.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981).   \n134.  The  use  of  the  word  “sex”  in  Title  IX  did  not  put  educational \ninstitutions and programs on notice that by accepting funding from the federal \ngovernment  for  educational  services  and  activities,  they  are  prohibited  from \nproviding separate bathrooms or other facilities for the two sexes.  See Adams, 57 \nF.4th at 816. That is clear not only from historical practice but from Defendants’ \nlongstanding interpretation of Title IX and its implementing regulations, which \n“include provisions that presuppose sex as a binary classification.”  85 Fed. Reg. at \n30,178. \n135.  The Final Rule is also unconstitutionally coercive because it leaves \nPlaintiff  States  with  “no  real  option  but  to  acquiesce”  to  the  Department’s \ninterpretation, Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577-78, 580-82 \n(2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J., joined by Breyer & Kagan, JJ.). \n136.  The Final Rule impermissibly conditions federal funding on States’ and \nschool recipients’ taking unconstitutional actions against faculty and students for \nengaging in protected expression.  See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 210-11 \n(1987). \n137.  Finally, extending Title IX’s protections to individuals based on gender \nidentity alone is not related, as it must be, to the statute’s purpose of remedying past \n51 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 52 of 62 PageID #: 52\n \ndiscrimination  against  women  and  promoting  equal  opportunity  for  women  in \neducation.  See South Dakota, 483 U.S. at 207-08. \nNondelegation & Major Questions Doctrine \n138.  The Final Rule also violates the nondelegation doctrine to the extent \nthe  Department  asserts  authority  to  define  new  “discriminatory  practices”  that \nviolate Title IX exclusively “through [its] regulations,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,517, \n33,560.  That sort of agency lawmaking transgresses “the Constitution’s rule vesting \nfederal legislative power in Congress,” not agencies acting by “pen-and-phone \nregulations.”  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 737, 753 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).   \n139.  Under that doctrine, an agency action involving a matter of “vast \neconomic and political significance” will stand only if the agency can identify \n“exceedingly clear language” authorizing its actions.  Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. \nDept. of Health and Human Services, 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021).  This doctrine rests \non the premise “that Congress intends to make major policy decisions itself, not \nleave those decisions to agencies.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723 (cleaned up). \n140.  The Final Rule has both vast economic and vast political significance.   \nThe Final Rule affects hundreds of billions of dollars, and the substantive question \ninvolved has been at the forefront of American discussion for at least the last decade.  \nThere is no clear congressional authorization for the Secretary to redefine “sex” \n52 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 53 of 62 PageID #: 53\n \naway from the understood biological dimorphic definition.  This is a decision that \nCongress would have intended to keep for itself. \nFirst Amendment \n141.  To the extent the Final Rule requires students like A.F. and school \nemployees to use pronouns contingent on a student’s professed gender identity \nrather the student’s sex, the Final Rule would violate the First Amendment.  Cf. \nDavis, 526 U.S. at 642-43, 650 (recognizing that a school’s Title IX liability extends \nto sexual harassment of a student by teachers and peers).  The First Amendment \nprotects the rights of individuals to decline to use pronouns inconsistent with sex.  \nSee  Beard,  97  F.4th  at  1117  (holding  that  the  Constitution  does  not  require \ngovernment  officials  to  use  “preferred  gender  pronouns”  “in  part  because  the \nspeaker has a [First Amendment] right” to “the misuse of a pronoun”). \n142.  The  Final  Rule’s  expansive  definition  of  “hostile  environment \nharassment” creates additional First Amendment problems.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,493, \n33,884.  The Rule defines sex-based harassment to include harassment based on \ncharacteristics extending far beyond sex, including various “sex characteristics” and \n“gender identity.”  Id. at 33,756, 33,886 (34 C.F.R. 106.02, .10).  This broad \nframework inhibits First Amendment rights by chilling, or risking liability over, \nstudents’ expression on deeply held views regarding significant moral and political \nissues.  \n53 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 54 of 62 PageID #: 54\n \n143.   For these reasons, the Final Rule is unconstitutional and should be \ndeclared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated.  5 U.S.C. 706(2).    \nCLAIM III \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)  \nThe Rule Is Arbitrary and Capricious  \n \n144.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations. \n145.  Federal law prohibits agency actions, findings, and conclusions that are \n“arbitrary, capricious,” or “an abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A).  \n146.  Agency actions are arbitrary and capricious when they “entirely fail to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem or offer an explanation for its decision \nthat runs counter to the evidence before it.”  Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter \n& Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. 657, 682 (2020) (cleaned up) (quoting \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).   \n147.  In  promulgating  the  Final  Rule  over  commenters’  wide-ranging \nopposition and in the face of decades of contrary agency practice, the Department \nacted arbitrarily and capriciously. \n148.  The Department fails to offer a reasoned explanation for the Final \nRule’s departure from the historic understanding—including within previous Title \nIX regulations—of Title IX’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination.  To the extent the \nDepartment  merely  relies  on  Bostock  for  its  changed  interpretation,  that  was \n54 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 55 of 62 PageID #: 55\n \nunreasonable given that the decision itself disclaimed any application to other sex-\nrelated provisions in federal law.  Bostock cannot excuse the inconsistency between \nthe Department’s longstanding view that enforcing sex-separation in spaces like \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities is not sex discrimination, on the one \nhand, and its new rule deeming such policies actionable Title IX discrimination, on \nthe other.    \n149.  The  Department  failed  to  adequately  “consider  and  respond  to \nsignificant comments received during the period for public comment” on the Final \nRule.  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  Commenters raised \na  raft  of  concerns  about  the  constitutional  defects  and  compliance  challenges \nattending the Final Rule’s approach.  In response, the Final Rule offers only a \n“handful of conclusory sentences” and unexplained inconsistencies.  Gresham v. \nAzar, 950 F.3d 93, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2020), vacated as moot, 142 S. Ct. 1665 (Mem.) \n(2022).  But “[n]odding to concerns raised by commenters only to dismiss them in \na conclusory manner is not the hallmark of reasoned decisionmaking.”  Gresham, \n950 F.3d at 103.   \n150.  The Department also “entirely fail[s] to consider [certain] important \naspect[s] of the problem” or address relevant evidence that “runs counter” to its cost-\nbenefit determination.    State  Farm, 463  U.S.  at  43.   The Department ignored \npractical  concerns  about  funding  recipients  lacking  any  way  to  authenticate  a \n55 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 56 of 62 PageID #: 56\n \nperson’s professed gender identity and failed to address commenters’ concerns that \nthe Final Rule will endanger privacy and safety interests.  The Department fails to \nconsider evidence of the biological differences between men and women that have \nlong  justified  sex-separated  facilities,  certain  sex-separated  classes,  and  sex-\nseparated sports.  And the Department downplays the grave compliance challenges \nwith structuring school operations based on internal notions of gender identity that \nare subjective and subject to change.  \n151.  The Department’s failure to consider these important aspects of the \nregulatory problem renders the Final Rule arbitrary and capricious under the APA \nand warrants enjoining, declaring unlawful, and setting aside the Final Rule.  5 \nU.S.C. 706(2). \nCLAIM IV                                                                                                      \nRelief Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201 and 5 U.S.C. 706                                                                            \nClaim for Declaratory Judgment  \n \n152.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations. \n153.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that “[i]n a case of actual \ncontroversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United States, upon the filing \nof an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any \ninterested party seeking such declaration.”  28 U.S.C. 2201(a). \n154.  This case presents an actual controversy.  The Final Rule operates on \nPlaintiff States directly as recipients of Title IX funds.  Enforcement of the Final \n56 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 57 of 62 PageID #: 57\n \nRule threatens to force recipients of Title IX funds to choose between violating State \nPlaintiffs’ laws and longstanding policies or losing billions of dollars of Title IX \nfunding. \n155.  This controversy arises in this Court’s jurisdiction, as it relates to \nquestions of federal law.  Venue is proper, as Plaintiff the State of Missouri resides \nin this District.  28 U.S.C. 1391(e). \n156.  Through  this  Complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  have  filed  an  appropriate \npleading to have their rights declared.  The Court can resolve this controversy by \ndeclaring that Title IX does not authorize the Department to condition receipt of \nTitle IX funds on using gender identity, rather than sex, as the rubric for student \nparticipation in covered educational programs.   \n57 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 58 of 62 PageID #: 58\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nAn actual controversy exists between the parties that entitles the Plaintiffs to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs request that this Court:  \na)  Enter a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. 705 and a \npreliminary injunction enjoining Defendants, and any other agency or \nemployee  of  the  United  States,  from  enforcing  or  implementing  the \nportions of the Final Rule that violate Title IX, the APA, and the federal \nConstitution;  \nb) Enter a judgment declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201 and 5 U.S.C. 706, \nthat (i) the Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX is unlawful; (ii) the Final \nRule is arbitrary and capricious; (iii) the Plaintiff States, their political \nsubdivisions, and their resident institutions may continue receiving Title \nIX funding notwithstanding any failure to adhere to the Final Rule’s \nunlawful requirements; and (iv) the Final Rule’s requirements may not be \nenforced against A.F. and other similarly situated individuals. \nc)  Set aside and vacate the Final Rule on the basis that it violates Title IX, \nthe APA, and the federal Constitution, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 706;   \nd) Enter a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. 705 and a \npreliminary injunction enjoining Defendants, and any other agency or \nemployee  of  the  United  States,  from  enforcing  or  implementing  the \n58 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 59 of 62 PageID #: 59\n \nportions of the Final Rule that violate Title IX, the APA, and the federal \nConstitution;  \ne)  Enter a judgment declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201 and 5 U.S.C. 706, \nthat (i) the Final Rule’s interpretation of Title IX is unlawful; (ii) the Final \nRule is arbitrary and capricious; (iii) the Plaintiff States, their political \nsubdivisions, and their resident institutions may continue receiving Title \nIX funding notwithstanding any failure to adhere to the Final Rule’s \nunlawful requirements; and (iv) the Final Rule’s requirements may not be \nenforced against A.F. and other similarly situated individuals. \nf)  Set aside and vacate the Final Rule on the basis that it violates Title IX, \nthe APA, and the federal Constitution, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 706. \ng) Award attorneys’ fees, costs, and other expenses of this action to Plaintiff \nA.F. under any applicable federal statute, including 28 U.S.C. 2412. \n \n \n   \n59 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:24-cv-00636-RWS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 05/07/24   Page: 60 of 62 PageID #: 60\n \nDated:  May 7, 2024        Respectfully submitted, \n   \nTIM GRIFFIN  ANDREW BAILEY \nArkansas Attorney General  Missouri Attorney General \n   \n/s/ Nicholas J.
