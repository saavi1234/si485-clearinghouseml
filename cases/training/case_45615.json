Oklahoma sought to challenge DOE's notice that in the enforcement of Title IX's prohibitions on sex discrimination, that DOE would interpret the term \"sex\" to include sexual orientation and gender identity, pursuant to President Biden's Executive Order 13988. The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that DOE's interpretation contradicted the statute and was arbitrary and capricious. They sought a declaratory judgment as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. U.S. District Court judge Jodi W. Dishman was assigned to this case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s Executive Order 13988 was issued on January 20, 2021. The U.S. Department of Education engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to this order, and received a variety of comments from States and interested parties. The DOE's Final Rule interpreted Title IX's prohibition on sex discrimination to give LGBTQ+ students and others protection from discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that the final rule exceeded statutory authority, on the grounds that it improperly extended the logic of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2020 decision in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17313/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton County</a></em>, which recognized discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status as a form of sex-based discrimination under Title VII. The complaint also alleged that the interpretation was arbitrary and capricious because the DOE failed to engage in reasoned decision making or offer an adequate explanation for the new rule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2025, the court dismissed the case without prejudice to refiling. The court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that they had properly served the defendants with the complaint by the applicable deadline. The case is now closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

BACKGROUND\n1. President Joe Biden, on January 20th, 2021, issued Executive Order 13988, which is titled\n“Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender\nIdentity or Sexual Orientation.” (“Executive Order”).\n2. Pursuant to Executive Order 13988, the U.S. Department of Education (“Department”)\nengaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking.  On June 22nd, 2021, the Department issued\n1 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 2 of 16\na “Notice of Interpretation” (“Notice”).  The Department’s Notice indicated that in the \nenforcement of Title IX’s prohibitions on sex discrimination the Department will interpret \nthe term “sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity. \n3.  Subsequent to the issuance of the Notice, the Department formally amended the Code of \nFederal Regulations (“CFR).  Specifically, on July 12th, 2022, the Department published in \nthe Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the 2020 Regulations. See \nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390 (July \n12, 2022).  \n4.  Comments were received from various Staes and interested parties before the expiration of \nthe  sixty  (60)  day  comment  period.    Some  of  the  problems,  or  potential  problems \nhighlighted were the burdens the proposed regulations would impose on the States and its \npolitical subdivisions and schools and risk of degradation of constitutional rights that the \nregulations  posed.    As  an  example,  the  obligations  of  recipients  to  respond  to  sex \ndiscrimination  are  expanded;  yet,  the  threshold  of  conduct  falling  within  the  newly \nredefined term of “sexual discrimination” was lowered.  The clear, undeniable result is that \nrecipients must be impossibly vigilant in policing interactions among students, parents, and \nfaculty or risk noncompliance with Title IX. \n5.  This Final Rule requires States, and other regulated parties such as the Oklahoma State \nDepartment of Education (“OSDE”), to ignore biological sex or face enforcement actions \nand the loss of federal, education funding.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 3 of 16\n6.  The Final Rule is a significant departure from the Departments’ past policies.  Despite this \ndeparture the Department did not adequately explain the Final Rule in terms of the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Title IX, rendering the Final Rule ambiguous. \n7.  The  Final  Rule  is  all-encompassing  and  preempts  all  “State  or  local  laws  or  other \nrequirements” that conflict with its terms, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885, and it applies to any \nschool “program or activity” regardless of whether the activity occurs within the school — \nor even within the United States. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § \n106.11). \n8.  The Department, in its interpretation and actions, has relied on the decision in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020) issued by the Supreme Court of the United States \n(“SCOTUS”).  The Department’s reliance is misplaced. \n9.  Bostock does not require the interpretations promulgated by the Department.  In Bostock, \nSCOTUS  held,  in  relevant  part,  that  terminating  an  employee  “simply  for  being \nhomosexual or transgender” constitutes discrimination “because of … sex” under Title VII. \nId. at 649–51, 655 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)). \n10.  SCOTUS “assum[ed]” that the term “sex” means “biological distinctions between male \nand female,” Id. at 655, and limited its decision and was unambiguous that its decision did \nnot “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination” \nor address other issues not before the Court such as “sex segregated bathrooms, locker \nrooms, and dress codes.” Id. at 681.  \n11.  The Final Rule rescinds, in whole or in part, constitutional safeguards protected by the \nTrump Administration.  Such constitutional safeguards include, without limitation, (a) \nassurances that students accused of harassment have access to a fair hearing, and (b) \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 4 of 16\nredefines harassment to include constitutionally protected, or previously constitutionally \nprotected, conduct.  \n12.  Oklahoma  schools  offer  extracurricular  activities  to  its  students  which  include \ninterscholastic athletics.  Many of the athletic teams are sex-specific (e.g. separate teams \nfor  boys’  and  girls’  sports  such  as  basketball,  cross  country,  powerlifting,  soccer, \nswimming, track, et cetera). \n13.  The practice of Oklahoma schools is that all students, including those who identify as a \ngender different from his, or her, biological sex, participate in activities based upon the \nactual, biological sex of the individual. \n14.  The practice of Oklahoma schools is that both students and staff utilize private facilities \n(e.g. restrooms, locker rooms, or changing rooms) based on biological sex.  Stated more \nspecifically, private facilities designated for “men” or “boys” may be used by biological \nmales only and private facilities designated for “women” or “girls” may be used by \nbiological females. \n15.  The OSDE does not have, and does not intend to adopt, a policy mandating that staff or \nstudents utilize pronouns that reflect a student’s personally perceived gender identity rather \nthan his, or her, actual, biological sex. \n16.  Oklahoma schools are placed in a dilemma of bad options.  Adhere to the Constitution and \nrisk the loss of federal, school funding. In the alternative, both students and faculty risk \ndamage to their respective futures for refusal to comply. \n17.  The Final Rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  5 U.S.C. § 706.   \nSpecifically,  the  Final  Rule  is  substantively  unlawful  because  its  purported \n“interpretations” of Title IX squarely conflict with the text of that statute.  Title IX, by its \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 5 of 16\nplain meaning wording, defines the term “sex” as “one sex” that is male or female.  20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a)(5) (describing those institutions which have a policy of admitting “only \nstudents of one sex”). \n18.  The Department of Education engaged in arbitrary-and-capricious decision making in its \npromulgation of the subject regulations because it failed to define the amorphous concepts \nof “gender identity” and “sexual orientation.”  The Department also failed to adequately \nand properly consider all relevant factors (e.g. the interplay between Title IX and other \nfederal and state laws).  The Department also failed, or refused, to provide any significant \nexplanation of its sudden reversal of its own prior policies. \n19.  It has yet to be determined whether Title IX applies to discrimination based on sexual \norientation or gender identity.  See Bostock at wherein SCOTUS specifically held “we \nhave not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do \nnot prejudge any such question today.” \n20.  Assuming arguendo, without conceding, that the concepts sexual orientation and gender \nidentity were protected against discrimination by Title IX.  Regardless, the Final Rule’s \nprovisions fail to faithfully implement such protections because the Rule makes unlawful \nschool policies that do not discriminate based on those concepts.  To the contrary, the clear \neffect of the Rule is discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  The \neffect is accomplished by allowing single-sex programs and facilities, but simultaneously \nrequiring opposite-sex access to those same programs and facilities, but only for those \nindividuals who claim a transgender gender identity.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 6 of 16\n21.  Title IX states, “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n22.  Title IX was enacted by Congress to promote equal opportunity for women and prohibits \neducational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex; however, title IX allows \nthe same educational institutions to maintain separation of the sexes/genders in some \nprograms.  Such separation is permissible in order to equalize opportunity for female \nstudents and to protect the privacy rights of all students. \n23.  Since the enactment of Title IX, the Department understood and interpreted the prohibition \non sex discrimination to refer to the biological sex of an individual.  In turn, all recipients \nunderstood and applied the prohibition according to the Departments’ interpretation.   \n24.  The Final Rule redefines the term “sex” to mean or include disparate terms i.e. “gender \nidentity,” “sex characteristics,” and “sex stereotypes,” inter alia.   \n25.  The Final Rule now redefines Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to include \n“discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related \nconditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33,886 (to be codified at \n34 C.F.R. § 106.10).  \n26.  The redefinition of “sex” under the Final Rule makes it clear, and unavoidable, that schools \nmust now ignore the traditional, accepted, previously and relied upon, definition of “sex” \nin order to promote a person’s subjective sense of his, or her, gender. \n27.  The traditional definition of “sex” must be ignored even in circumstances wherein female \nstudents are deprived of the equal opportunities in education that Title IX provided upon \nits enactment. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 7 of 16\n28.  Pursuant to the Final Rule, federal funding may be withheld from schools that do not allow \nstudents access to “restrooms and locker rooms” and comply with any “appearance codes \n(including dress and grooming codes)” based on gender identity.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at \n33,816.  In real terms, a violation now occurs under Title IX when a transgender student is \ndenied access to a bathroom or locker room of the opposite biological sex. See, e.g., 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,818.  Such access clearly violates the rights of other non-transgender \nstudents and violates established law, to wit: “The Department cannot enforce Title IX in \na  manner  that  requires  recipients  to  restrict  any  rights  protected  under  the  First \nAmendment.”  85. Fed. Reg. 30,071.  \n29.  The Final Rule further commands a lower standard for sexual harassment.  Specifically, \nthe Final Rule dictates that “[s]ex-based harassment, including harassment predicated on \nsex stereotyping or gender identity, is covered by Title IX if it is sex-based, unwelcome, \nsubjectively and objectively offensive, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to limit or deny \na student’s ability to participate in or benefit from a recipient’s education program or \nactivity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516  \n30.  The new, lower standard and definition of sexual harassment expands the prohibition \npreviously found under Title IX and is contrary to established, legal precedent from the \nSupreme Court of the United States (“SCOTUS”).  See Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of \nEduc., 526 U.S. 629, 649–50 (1999), which defined as conduct “that is so severe, pervasive, \nand objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the \neducational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.” 526 U.S. at 650.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 8 of 16\n31.  Another obvious result of the Final Rule and its enforcement is that students, faculty, and \nstaff  are  subject  onerous,  unjustified  investigations if  they  fail to  use  a transgender \nstudent’s preferred pronouns. \n32.  Prior 2020 Regulations purposefully adopted the standard of sexual harassment set forth in \nDavis “to ensure that speech and expression are prohibited only when their seriousness and \nimpact avoid First Amendment concerns.”  85. Fed. Reg. 30142.  \n33.  No justification may be found, or has been sufficiently articulated by, the Department in \nthe departure from the Davis standard.  Perhaps more important, the Department has failed \nor declined to explain how the lowered standard conforms to the Constitutional mandates.  \nThese facts are highlighted by the verbiage that the Department “believe[s] a broader \nstandard is appropriate.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,498.  Remarkably, no basis, cogent or \notherwise, is provided for the asserted belief. \n34.  The  Final  Rule  lacks  objective  standards,  which  in  turn,  renders  every  complaint \nsubjective.  As an example, interpretation and enforcement of the Final Rule is subject to \ntransient  identification  (i.e.  those  individuals  that  may  not  permanently  identify  as \ntransgender).  See Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders  451  (5th  Ed.  2013)  (defining  “transgender”  to  include  “individuals  who \ntransiently” identify one way).  This places recipients in an untenable, if not impossible, \nposition … how to determine the true intentions or true identifications of an individual and \nhow to respond to a given set of circumstances.  It also places recipients and other students \nat unnecessary risk when faced with instances in which the true intent is to merely gain \naccess to a female bathroom, locker room or other facility for predatory purposes.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 9 of 16\n35.  Easily foreseeable examples make it clear that the Final Rule is fatally defective on the \ngrounds that it is vague, ambiguous, and over broad.   \n36.  The Final Rule is also fatally defective on the grounds that it fails to adequately notify \nrecipients  of  the  conduct  that  constitutes  compliance  sufficient  to  investigations \nwithholding of funding. \n37.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, this Court should postpone the effective date of the Final Rule \nand preliminarily enjoin the implementation of the interpretation to cover discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  \n38.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), this Court vacate and set aside the Final Rule and \npermanently enjoin the Defendants the implementation, enforcement and interpretation of \nTitle IX as proposed by the Defendants. \nII.  PARTIES \n39.  The Plaintiff incorporates fully by reference ¶¶ 1 through 38 set forth supra. \n40.  The Plaintiff, the Oklahoma State Department of Education (“OSDE”), is a political \nsubdivision of the State of Oklahoma.  More specifically, the OSDE is the state education \nagency of the sovereign State of Oklahoma.  OSDE is charged with determining the \npolicies of, and directing the administration and supervision of, the Oklahoma public \nschool system and ensuring compliance with Title IX.  The OSDE is bound by the \nOklahoma Constitution, Oklahoma laws, and applicable federal laws, including without \nlimitation, Title IX.  The State of Oklahoma is a sovereign State of the United States.  \n41.  The OSDE receives federal funding administered by the United States Department of \nEducation, including funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and \nTitle I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 10 of 16\n42.  The United States of America (“United States”) is the federal sovereign and is being sued \npursuant to 5 U.S.C §§ 702–03 and is also sued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1346. 9.  \n43.  Miguel Cardona is the Secretary of the Department of Education and is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \n44.  The Department of Education (“Department”) is an executive branch department of the \nUnited States.  The Department is responsible for administering most federal assistance for \neducation to the States.  The Department also administers and enforces Title IX.  \n45.  Catherine  Lhamon  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Civil  Rights  at  the  Department  of \nEducation and is sued in her official capacity.  \n46.  Randolph Wills is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement at the Department of \nEducation and is sued in his official capacity.  \n47.  All Defendants, other than the United States, are agencies of the United States or officers \nand employees of the United States and were, at all times material hereto, acting in their \nrespective official capacities or under the color of law. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n48.  The Plaintiff incorporates fully by reference ¶¶ 1 through 47 set forth supra. \n49.  This Court has federal-question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 on the grounds \nthat this lawsuit involves the breadth and scope of the Department’s authority under Title \nIX.  This lawsuit also arises under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702–703. \n50.  This Court has equitable jurisdiction over the issues presented.  See Larson v. Domestic & \nForeign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689–91 (1949). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 11 of 16\n51.  This Court also possesses the remedial power to review, and to enjoin, ultra vires or \nunconstitutional agency action as complained of and set forth at length herein.  Id. \n52.  Venue is proper before this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) on the grounds that \nthe agencies of the United States and officers of the United States in their official capacities. \n53.  The OSDE “resides” and/or is constituted in this district.  Moreover, a substantial part of \nthe acts, omissions or conduct which gives rise to the claims levied herein arose in this \ndistrict. \n54.  The Plaintiff asserts its right to, and respectfully demands, a trial by jury on all issues \npursuant to the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 38. \nIV.  CLAIMS  \n \nCOUNT I   THE FINAL RULE EXCEEDS STATUTORY AUTHORITYAND VIOLATES \nTHE LAW 5 U.S.C. § 706 110. \n \n55.  The Plaintiff incorporates fully by reference ¶¶ 1 through 54 set forth supra. \n56.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” or “in excess \nof statutory … authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” See 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C). \n57.  The Final Rule violates § 706(2)(A), (C) and exceeds the Department’s statutory authority \non the grounds that the Department, in its interpretation of Title VII has erroneously relied \nupon, and improperly extended, the SCOTUS decision on Bostock as stated above.  The \nDepartment’s interpretation ignores significant textual and structural differences between \nTitle VII and Title IX … as well as the disparate subject matter covered by the respective \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 12 of 16\nstatutes … as well as the express disclaimer and limitation noted in Bostock i.e. that the \nholding did not apply to other federal or state laws. \n58.  The Final Rule violates the law and exceeds the Department’s statutory authority.  Title, \nIX, in plain, unambiguous wording, allows recipients of federal education funding, such as \nthe OSDE, to distinguish between biological males and biological females in situations the \nFinal Rule condemns.  \n59.  The correct interpretation of Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” \ndoes not include protections based upon concepts of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n60.  The Final Rule violates the law and exceeds the Department’s statutory authority on the \ngrounds that it compels recipients of federal school funding to violate the First Amendment \nin order to remain compliant with Title IX.  More particularly, the Final Rule abandons the \nprevious definition of sexual harassment articulated in Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., \n526  U.S.  629,  649–50  (1999),  which  was  adopted  by  the  Department  via  its  2020 \nrulemaking.    The  Final  Rule  now  embraces  a  significantly  weaker  standard  that \nencompasses constitutionally protected activity.  \n61.  By reinterpreting the word “sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity the \nDepartment has impermissibly expanded the liability, or potential liability, of recipients of \nfederal, school funding beyond what the liability traditionally permitted under Title IX.  As \nan example, the Final Rule fundamentally rewrites Title IX’s prohibition on sex-based \ndiscrimination.  Now, the failure to affirm a student’s gender identity would constitute \n“sex-based harassment.” See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884. 116. Recipients have an \nobligation under the Final Rule to “take specific actions … to promptly and effectively \nprevent sex discrimination,” including what the Final Rule now redefines as sex-based \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 13 of 16\nharassment. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887.  An obvious consequence is that recipients would have \nan obligation under the Final Rule to confront, and possibly discipline, students and \nemployees  who  refuse  to  affirm  another’s  gender  identity.    Failure  to  do  so  risks \nnoncompliance with Title IX as now interpreted. \n62.  Defendants violate the law as cited above and exceed their statutory and regulatory \nauthority not only in the promulgation of the Final Rule, but in the enforcement of the \nsame. \nCOUNT II   PROMULGATION  AND  ENFORCEMENT  OF  THE  FINAL  RULE \nCONSTITUTES  ARBITRARY  AND  CAPRICIOUS  AGENCY  ACTION  IN \nVIOLATION OF 5 U.S.C. § 706 118.  \n \n63.  The Plaintiff incorporates fully by reference ¶¶ 1 through 62 set forth supra. \n64.  The Final Rule is a final agency action, as defined by statute infra, and is subject to review \nunder the APA.   \n65.  “[A]gency action” is “the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, \nor the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  \n66.  An agency rule is defined as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or \nparticular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law \nor policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” \nId. at § 551(4).   \n67.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious under well-established case law as set forth \nbelow. \n68.  “[A], an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors \nwhich Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 14 of 16\nevidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference \nin view or the product of agency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n69.  An agency action is arbitrary or capricious if it fails to “articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” \nId. \n70.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary \nand capricious.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n71.  Here,  the  Defendants  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  in  issuing  the  Final  Rule.  \nSpecifically, and without limitation, the Defendants: (a) failed or refused to engage in \nreasoned decision making, (b) relied on factors Congress did not intend to be considered, \n(c) entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, and (d) offered no \nexplanation, or no plausible explanation, for the decision.  \n72.  Defendants willfully ignored the limitation set forth in Bostock itself (i.e. limited to the \nissue presented under Title VI) as well as case law that recognized that “Bostock … was \nlimited only to Title VII itself” and “does not stretch to [other statutes].”  See e.g. Pelcha \nv. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021); See also, Neese v. Becerra, 640 \nF. Supp. 3d 668 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (Kacsmaryk, J.); compare 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,806.  \n73.  The Final Rule also fails to adequately consider the effects of its terms on the States and \naffected political subdivisions of the States such as the OSDE.  See generally 89 Fed. Reg. \n33,474–33,896.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 15 of 16\n74.  The Defendants were obliged to “adequately assess reliance interests” or “reasonably \nconsider […] the relevant issues and reasonably explain […] the decision.”  See Texas v. \nBiden, 10 F.4th 538, 552, 555 (5th Cir. 2021).   \n75.  Despite their legal obligation(s), the Defendant’s expressly “decline[d] to opine on how \n[the Final Rule] interacts or conflicts with any specific State laws because it would require \na fact-specific analysis.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33,822.  Rather, the Defendant’s merely “refer[red] \nthe public to § 106.6(b), which affirms that a [school’s] obligation to comply with Title IX \nand the regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law.” 89 Fed. Reg. \n33,822.  \n76.  Finally, the Final Rule fails to properly articulate the basis for its departure from established \nSCOTUS precedent related to sex-based harassment definition and policies previously \nadopted by the Department itself, as well as prior Department rulemaking. \nV.  DEMAND FOR RELIEF \n77.  The Plaintiff incorporates full by reference ¶¶ 1 through 76 set forth supra. \n78.  This Court is authorized to award the requested vacatur and declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  See APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 705, and 706.  See also 28 U.S.C. § 1361, commonly \nreferenced as the Declaratory Judgment Act; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202 (Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 57 and 65) and the general and legal equitable powers of the Court.  \n79.  The OSDE respectfully requests that the following relief from this Court: \na.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, postponement of the effective date of the Final Rule. \nb.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), a finding and holding that the Final Rule is unlawful \nand that the same be set aside, vacated and held for naught. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD   Document 1   Filed 05/06/24   Page 16 of 16\nc.  A Declaratory Judgment holding that the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX and \nexceeds agency authority. \nd.  A Declaratory Judgment holding that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious, \nboth in its wording and enforcement as well as in the process which brought the \nFinal Rule into being. \ne.  That the Plaintiff be awarded preliminary (temporary) and permanent injunctive \nrelief prohibiting the Defendants from interpreting and/or enforcing Title IX as \nbarring discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  The instant \nrequest  for  relief  includes,  without  limitation,  the  denial  of  federal  financial \nassistance or the pursuit, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, \ninvestigations, or other enforcement actions.  The instant request for relief also \nincludes, without limitation, the enforcement, implementation or other reliance on \nthe Final Rule, in any form, against the OSDE or any Oklahoma school. \nf.  An award of such other relief as the Court may deem warranted and proper, whether \nin equity or in law. \nDated May 6th, 2024.        Respectfully submitted, \n             \ns/ Michael T.

[Doc. No. 13]. The Court \nreminded Plaintiff that under Rule 4(i)(1), “Plaintiff needed to deliver a copy of the \nsummons and complaint to the United States Attorney for the Western District of \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD     Document 32     Filed 01/16/25     Page 2 of 4\n \nOklahoma (or to a designated assistant United States attorney or clerical employee) or to \nthe civil-process clerk at the United States attorney’s office.” [Id. at 3]. The Court warned \nPlaintiff that absent proof of timely and proper service by the deadline, “the Court will \ndismiss this action without prejudice to refiling or dismiss any defendant not properly \nserved, without further warning and without further show cause orders.” [Id.].1  \nPlaintiff responded on October 3, 2024, asserting that it had “complied with the \nCourt’s Order.” [Doc. No. 31]. Plaintiff attached fifteen exhibits purporting to show proof \nof service. [Doc. Nos. 31-1 to 31-15].  \nHowever, Plaintiff has not demonstrated proof of proper service. Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 4(i)(1) instructs that to serve the United States, a party must  \n(A)(i) deliver a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the United \nStates attorney for the district where the action is brought—or to an \nassistant United States attorney or clerical employee whom the United \nStates attorney designates in a writing filed with the court clerk—or (ii) \nsend a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the civil-process clerk \nat the United States attorney’s office;  \n \n(B) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States at Washington, D.C.; and  \n \n(C) if the action challenges an order of a nonparty agency or officer of the \nUnited States, send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the \nagency or officer. \n \n \n1 The Court previously noted a companion case in this Court filed by the State of \nOklahoma, State of Oklahoma v. Cardona, Case No. 24-cv-00461-JD (W.D. Okla.), \nwhich is now pending on appeal, Tenth Circuit Case No. 24-6205. See [Doc. No. 13 at 3 \nn.1]. \n2 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD     Document 32     Filed 01/16/25     Page 3 of 4\n \nTo serve a federal agency or officer in their official capacity, “a party must serve the \nUnited States and also send a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or \ncertified mail” to the agency or officer. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(i)(2).  \n  Plaintiff has not complied with Rule 4(i). Plaintiff has filed proof of service on the \ncivil process clerk at the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. See \n[Doc. Nos. 18, 22, 31-4, 31-7]. But because this action was brought in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma, Plaintiff would need to serve the United States Attorney for this \ndistrict or, alternatively, the civil-process clerk at the United States Attorney’s Office for \nthe Western District of Oklahoma.2 Therefore, Plaintiff has not properly served the \nUnited States. Accordingly, it has also failed to serve the other Defendants, who are \neither federal officials sued in their official capacities or a federal agency. See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(i)(2). \nBecause Plaintiff did not timely serve Defendants within 90 days of the filing of \nthis action and did not comply with the Court’s order giving Plaintiff additional time to \neffect service, the Court DISMISSES this action as to all Defendants without prejudice to \nrefiling under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m).  \n \n2 By using the language “the civil-process clerk at the United States attorney’s \noffice,” the plain language in Rule 4(i)(1)(A)(ii) clearly references “the United States \nattorney for the district where the action is brought” in Rule 4(i)(1)(A)(i). Other courts \nhave read the plain language this same way. See Gerow v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., Case No. \nCV-23-01059-PHX-DGC, 2023 WL 8781393, at *1 (D. Ariz. Dec. 19, 2023) (collecting \ncases).    \n3 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00459-JD     Document 32     Filed 01/16/25     Page 4 of 4\n \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 16th day of January 2025.  \n         \n         \n          \n         \n \n \n4 ",

[Doc. No. 1]. No summonses were issued. \nThe Court issued a show cause order on August 6, 2024 for Plaintiff to explain why \nservice has not been timely made upon Defendants. [Doc. No. 2]. On August 7, 2024 \nPlaintiff filed a response to the Court’s show cause order and attached certified mail \nreceipts and USPS tracking records for service upon the Defendants. See [Doc. No. 4].  \nPlaintiff’s show cause response does not show proper service. To effect service of \nprocess on the United States, an agency of the United States, or an officer of the United \nStates acting in an official capacity, Plaintiff must comply with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 4(i). Plaintiff has not properly served the United States of America, the United \nStates Department of Education, nor any of the individual defendants in their official \ncapacities in accordance with Rule 4(i).  \n  Given Plaintiff’s failure to properly serve, the Court is inclined to dismiss this \naction without prejudice.
