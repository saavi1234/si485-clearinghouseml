On May 15, 2024, three white students filed a putative class action lawsuit against the University of Oklahoma and a series of University officials in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs alleged that the University discriminated in favor of Black students when awarding financial aid. They sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause; they also brought a Title VI claim for racial discrimination. Represented by private counsel and the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (a think tank), the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and compensatory damages. They sought to represent a class of current, former, and future students at the University who are not Black and who applied for financial aid but did not have their full cost of attendance covered. Judge Patrick Wyrck was assigned to the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 15, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs did not plead facts establishing the University engaged in intentional race discrimination in awarding financial aid, and that the University is not a &ldquo;person&rdquo; covered by &sect; 1983. On August 5, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint removing the Equal Protection Clause claim against the University (but retaining the equal protection claims against individual University officials). Four days later, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss. The case is ongoing as of May 4, 2025.</p>",

C__IV__-_2_4_-4_9_5_-_P_R_W__  \nPlaintiffs,  COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION \nvs. \nTHE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA; \nJOSEPH HARROZ, JR., President; JEFF \nBLAHNIK, Vice President for Division of \nEnrollment Management & Chief \nEnrollment Officer; COURTNEY \nHENDERSON, Executive Director of \nFinancial Aid Services; and DORION \nBILLUPS, Director of Connection and \nStudent Engagement, \nDefendants. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nPlaintiffs Brayden Johnson, Logan Rhines, and Kayla Savage bring this action for \ndeclaratory relief and damages on behalf of themselves and a Class of others similarly \nsituated  against  the  following  Defendants:  (i)  the  University  of  Oklahoma;  and  the \nUniversity’s  (ii)  President;  (iii)  Vice  President  for  the  Division  of  Enrollment \nManagement/Executive  Director  of  the  Office  of  Admissions  &  Recruitment; \n(iv) Executive Director of Financial Aid Services; and (v) Director of Connection and\nStudent Engagement (collectively the “University of Oklahoma”). \n1 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 2 of 22\n  Defendants’ practice of awarding financial aid to students on the basis of race \nviolates Plaintiffs’ and other Class members’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For the reasons \nset forth in this Complaint, Plaintiffs and the proposed Class are entitled to declaratory \nrelief and damages. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.” Students for \nFair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 206 (2023) \n(“SFFA”). \n2.  Yet racial preferences continue to exist at the University of Oklahoma. \nRather than determining who to admit based on their race, the University of Oklahoma \ndetermines how much financial aid it gives to students based on their race. That is unlawful. \n3.  Universities that discriminate on the basis of race when making financial-aid \nawards violate the same equal protection principles that apply in the admissions context \nand elsewhere. \n4.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the \ngovernment from considering race when providing public benefits—such as financial \naid—except when the government can satisfy strict scrutiny. This is an exceedingly high \nstandard.  The  government  must  show  that  racial  preferences  serve  a  compelling \ngovernment interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest. No other showing will \nsuffice.  \n5.  And Title VI requires, at minimum, that recipients of federal funding meet \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 3 of 22\nthis same exacting standard—strict scrutiny—when using racial classifications. \n6.  Defendants’ use of race to allocate financial-aid resources cannot survive \nstrict scrutiny. Government actors may not “intentionally allocate preference to those ‘who \nmay have little in common with one another but the color of their skin.’” Id. at 220 (quoting \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 647 (1993)). And if Defendants had a cognizable interest in \neasing the financial burden on certain racial groups attending the University of Oklahoma, \nthey could serve that interest by more narrowly tailored means, such as awarding need-\nbased, but race-blind, financial aid. \n7.  Defendants’  race-based  financial-aid  practices  thus  violate  the  Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  They  also  violate  Title VI,  which \nprohibits racial discrimination by all programs receiving federal financial assistance. \n8.  Such violations entitle Plaintiffs and the Class to declaratory relief under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and damages under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n9.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \n10.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because at least one Defendant is a \nresident of this District and all Defendants are residents of Oklahoma, and because a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 4 of 22\nPARTIES \n \n11.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson is a resident of Oklahoma and an undergraduate \nstudent in an accelerated master’s degree program at the University of Oklahoma. \n12.  Plaintiff  Logan  Rhines  is  a  resident  of  Oklahoma  and  a  junior  at  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. \n13.  Plaintiff  Kayla  Savage  is  a  resident  of  Oklahoma  and  a  senior  at  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. \n14.  Defendant the University of Oklahoma is a public educational institution \nbased in Norman, Oklahoma. The University of Oklahoma accepts substantial financial \nassistance from the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, for example, the University of \nOklahoma was awarded more than $150 million through federal programs. And in fiscal \nyear 2022, it was awarded more than $70 million.1 The University of Oklahoma also \nreceives financial assistance from the federal government by enrolling students who pay \ntuition, at least in part, with federal financial aid.  \n15.  Defendant Joseph Harroz, Jr. is President of the University of Oklahoma. In \nthat role, he serves as chief executive officer of the University and is ultimately responsible \nfor the University’s financial aid program.

Defendant Billups is \nsued in his official capacity.  \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n \n19.  Equal  protection  prohibits  government  entities—including  public \nuniversities—from distributing benefits or burdens based on race, unless the government \nidentifies a compelling interest and shows that its policy is narrowly tailored to pursue that \ninterest. Racial classifications usually fail under this standard, known as “strict scrutiny.” \nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). The Supreme Court has \nidentified only limited “compelling interests that permit resort to race-based government \naction,” namely “remediating specific, identified instances of past discrimination” and \n“avoiding imminent and serious risks to human safety in prisons, such as a race riot.” SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 207.  \n20.  In Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), the Supreme Court held that \nthe Equal Protection Clause also allowed limited consideration of race in higher-education \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 6 of 22\nadmissions. The Court required schools to use an admissions plan “flexible enough to \nensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual.” Id. at 337. Thus, in a related case, \nthe Court rejected an admissions program that “automatically” awarded points to minority \napplicants. Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 271 (2003). The Court further assumed that \nschools would continue to pursue race-neutral options and contemplated that “25 years \nfrom now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest \napproved today.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343. \n21.  The Court later returned to the issue of affirmative action in two cases, both \nnamed Fisher v. University of Texas. In Fisher I, the Court reminded lower courts that \n“strict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before \nturning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not \nsuffice.” Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 312 (2013) (“Fisher I”). Because \nthe trial court had failed to “perform this searching examination,” the Supreme Court \nreversed. Id. at 312–13. In Fisher II, a seven-member Court upheld the University of \nTexas’s consideration of race in admissions based on the unique facts of that case, but \naffirmed that strict scrutiny applies to all government classifications based on race—no \nexceptions. See Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 579 U.S. 365, 377–80 (2016) (“Fisher \nII”).  \n22.  In 2023, the Supreme Court held that the use of race in admissions by \nHarvard College and the University of North Carolina (“UNC”) violated equal-protection \nprinciples. In so doing, the Supreme Court eliminated the special dispensation it had \nprovided for college admissions programs in earlier cases. See SFFA, 600 U.S. at 214–24.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 7 of 22\n23.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed its longstanding teaching that race-conscious \n“[u]niversity programs must comply with strict scrutiny.” Id. at 213. And it emphasized \nthat it had “time and again forcefully rejected the notion that government actors may \nintentionally allocate preference to those ‘who may have little in common with one another \nbut the color of their skin.’” Id. at 220 (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 647). \n24.  The Supreme Court has never held that race-based financial-aid decisions \nsatisfy strict scrutiny. \n25.  Racial discrimination in financial aid was illegal before the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in SFFA, and it remains illegal after the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA. That \nis because “[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most \nexact connection between justification and classification.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270 (citation \nomitted). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nI.  Racial Considerations in Financial Aid at the University of Oklahoma \n26.  The University of Oklahoma is prohibited from using affirmative action \nwhen  making  admissions  decisions.  See  OKLA. CONST.  art.  II,  § 2–36A  (prohibiting \npreferential treatment based on race by state educational institutions). \n27.  Still, the University of Oklahoma places a high value on racial diversity. The \nUniversity monitors the racial statistics of admitted students. And one of the University’s \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 8 of 22\nexpress goals is to increase the number of black students on campus.2  \nA.  The University of Oklahoma Operates Many Race-Based Programs \n28.  In an effort to increase racial diversity, the University of Oklahoma operates \nand has operated a host of race conscious programs. These programs, which give race-\nbased preferences to black students, begin before matriculation and continue through \ngraduation.3 \n29.  Prior to student matriculation, certain black admittees are invited to attend \nthe “McLaurin & Lewis Leadership Conference.”4 This conference is a “college preview \nprogram for African American students” during which they “are introduced to current \nAfrican American student leaders, faculty, staff, and alumni.”5 Selection for the conference \nis race-based. \n30.  If black students opt to attend the University of Oklahoma, the school then \ninvites them to what it has dubbed “Welcome Black Weekend.”6 According to university \n \n2   African  American  Students,  UNIV. OF OKLA.,  https://bit.ly/43qZ110  (last  accessed \nMarch 21, 2024) (highlighting that the University “seeks to increase African American \nstudent . . . representation on campus”). \n3   Many of these programs appear, on their face, to be inconsistent with the Oklahoma \nConstitution’s  Bill  of  Rights.  See  OKLA.  CONST.  art.  II,  § 2–36A  (prohibiting \npreferential  treatment  based  on  race  in  the  operation  of  public  education).  The \nUniversity’s basis for operating these programs is unclear. \n4   African American Students, supra, n.2. \n5   McLaurin Lewis Leadership Conference, UNIV.

The University of Oklahoma continues to engage in racially discriminatory \nactivities  after  students  are  admitted.  For  example,  the  University  hosts  race-based \nprogramming and activities, sponsored by the University’s Office of African American \nPrograms & Services.9 \n32.  And even at the end of Oklahoma students’ time at the University, race \ncontinues to play a role: The University hosts an annual “Black Excellence Ceremony,” \nwhich is designed to honor black graduates only.10 \n33.  In an effort to obscure the extent to which it has engaged in race-based \ndecision making, the University of Oklahoma has recently deleted many webpages with \ninformation  about  its  diversity  and  race-based  programs.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to \ndetermine the full extent of the University’s race-based programs. \n \n7   Houston Williams, Welcome Black Weekend Coming Aug. 26-28, OKLA. INST.

The University of Oklahoma Considers Race When Awarding Financial \n  Aid \n \n34.  Given the extent to which race has infused the University of Oklahoma’s \ndecision-making processes, it is perhaps unsurprising that the University of Oklahoma also \nawards financial aid based on race. \n35.  The University of Oklahoma advertises on its “Financial Aid” webpage that \nduring the 2022–2023 academic year the average financial aid given to undergraduates was \n$15,747, and that nearly 71% of students received aid of some amount.11 Based on the \nnumber of students at the University of Oklahoma, this amounts to more than $230 million \nin financial assistance.  \n36.  Students are considered for financial aid and scholarships when they apply \nto the University of Oklahoma through the Common Application, OU Application, or \nApply Coalition with Scoir. On each of these applications, students may indicate their race. \n37.  A statistical analysis of publicly available data indicates that the University \nof Oklahoma considers race when awarding financial aid to its students. Based on the \nUniversity of Oklahoma’s published enrollment data and the financial-aid data that it \nreported to the Department of Education from 2009 to 2022, statistical analysis shows that \nblack students receive more institutional grant aid from the University of Oklahoma than \nother students, even when controlling to the extent possible for factors such as family \nincome.  \n38.  This statistical analysis provides evidence of the extent of discrimination \n \n11  Financial Aid, UNIV. OF OKLA, https://bit.ly/3VtFPOn (last accessed March 21, 2024). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 11 of 22\nstemming from affirmative action policies in university grants that benefit some favored \ngroup (in this case, black students) and harm other disfavored groups (in this case, non-\nblack students). The analysis uses data at the university-year level regarding the net price \nof tuition at the institution, the proportion of students enrolled from a group that appears to \nreceive beneficial treatment, and measures of the family income of enrolled students.  \n39.  Plaintiffs are aware of no public statement from the University of Oklahoma \ndisclosing that the school systematically discriminates on the basis of race when allocating \nfinancial aid. \n40.  In the absence of this sophisticated statistical analysis, the University of \nOklahoma’s systematic racial discrimination with respect to financial aid would not have \nbecome known. \n41.  Plaintiffs and the Class could not have learned about the University of \nOklahoma’s systematic racial discrimination at an earlier date through the exercise of \nreasonable diligence. \n42.  The University of Oklahoma’s racial discrimination with respect to financial \naid is consistent with recent peer-reviewed econometric research showing that American \ncolleges and universities have, in the recent past, provided racial discounts when awarding \nfinancial aid.12 \n \n12  Ian Fillmore, Price Discrimination and Public Policy in the US College Market, 90 (3) \nTHE REV. OF ECON. STUD., 1228, 1240 & tbl. 2 (2023) (finding a statistically significant \nrelationship between black students and tuition discounts using a robust 2007–2008 \ndata set). \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 12 of 22\nII.  Effect of the University of Oklahoma’s Racial Discrimination on Plaintiffs \n43.  Because of Defendants’ race-based financial aid decision making, Plaintiffs \nreceived less financial aid from the University of Oklahoma than they would have if the \nUniversity of Oklahoma did not discriminate on the basis of race when awarding financial \naid. \nA.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson \n44.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson is an undergraduate student in an accelerated \nmaster’s degree program at the University of Oklahoma. Because Plaintiff Johnson does \nnot have the financial means to pay for college, he applied for scholarships from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma.  \n45.  Plaintiff Johnson self-identified as white and non-Hispanic when applying \nfor financial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n46.  Plaintiff Johnson received a merit scholarship in the amount of $4,000 per \nsemester and two smaller scholarships totaling $1,000 and $1,750 per year, respectively. \nPlaintiff Johnson did not receive any other scholarships or financial aid from the University \nof Oklahoma. \n47.  Plaintiff Johnson would have received additional financial aid from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \n48.  To support himself while at the University of Oklahoma, Plaintiff Johnson \nworks at Home Depot three days a week. He previously worked as a cashier at a bagel shop \nfor the same reason. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 13 of 22\nB.  Plaintiff Logan Rhines \n49.  Plaintiff Logan Rhines is a junior at the University of Oklahoma. He is a \nfirst-generation college student. Because Plaintiff Rhines does not have the financial means \nto pay for college, he applied for scholarships from the University of Oklahoma.  \n50.  Plaintiff Rhines identified himself as white and non-Hispanic when applying \nfor financial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n51.  Plaintiff Rhines received a merit scholarship based on his ACT score and \nGPA in the amount of $1,000 per semester. Plaintiff Rhines did not receive any other \nscholarships or financial aid from the University of Oklahoma. \n52.  Plaintiff  Rhines  would  have  received  additional  financial  aid  from  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \nC.  Plaintiff Kayla Savage \n53.  Plaintiff Kayla Savage is a senior at the University of Oklahoma. Plaintiff \nSavage transferred to the University of Oklahoma after attending community college.  \n54.  An official from the University of Oklahoma’s Office of Admissions told \nPlaintiff Savage that financial aid was generally not available to students like her, but \nwould have been if she were African American. \n55.  Because Plaintiff Savage did not have the financial means to pay for college, \nshe nonetheless applied for scholarships from the University of Oklahoma.  \n56.  Plaintiff Savage self-identified as white and non-Hispanic when applying for \nfinancial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 14 of 22\n57.  Plaintiff Savage received no financial aid from the University of Oklahoma. \n58.  Plaintiff  Savage  would  have  received  additional  financial  aid  from  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n59.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other current, former, \nand  incoming  University  of  Oklahoma  students  similarly  entitled  to  damages  and \ndeclaratory relief.  \n60.  The Class consists of all current, future, and former undergraduate students \nof the University of Oklahoma who were enrolled at any time from the date that the \nUniversity of Oklahoma began systematically discriminating in favor of black students \nwhen awarding financial aid to the date of class certification, who did not receive financial \naid covering all costs of attendance, who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents, who \napplied for financial aid, and who are not identified in the school’s financial aid or \nadmissions database as Black or African American. These Class members are seeking \ndamages from Defendant the University of Oklahoma under Title VI, and a declaratory \njudgment declaring that their rights were violated under both Title VI and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n61.  The Class shall exclude any judicial officers presiding over this action, as \nwell as members of their immediate families and members of their judicial staffs. The Class \nshall also exclude any attorney appearing in this action and any juror assigned to this action, \nas well as members of their immediate families. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 15 of 22\n62.  The  proposed  Class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1). The exact number of Class members is \nunknown at this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate discovery. But given \nthe number of students who attend and apply for financial aid from the University of \nOklahoma every year, there are at least thousands of members of the proposed Class. \n63.  Common questions of law and fact exist with respect to the Class. See FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(a)(2). Those questions include: \na.  Whether Defendants denied financial aid to the Class members on the basis \nof their race (both Counts); \nb.  Whether  Defendants’  challenged  conduct  violates  the  Equal  Protection \nClause (Count I); and \nc.  Whether Defendants’ challenged conduct violates Title VI (Count II).  \n64.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the other Class members. See FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(a)(3). All members of the Class currently attend, have attended, or will attend \nthe University of Oklahoma and are being denied, were denied, or will be denied financial \naid on the basis of race. They were thus similarly affected by the wrongful conduct \ncomplained of herein. \n65.  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of  all  Class \nmembers. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4). Plaintiffs’ counsel is competent and experienced in \nclass and civil rights litigation, and Plaintiffs have no interests adverse or antagonistic to \nthe Class. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 16 of 22\n66.  The Class is certifiable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The \ncommon questions of law and fact listed above predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members of the Class. All Class members are entitled to similarly race-\nblind consideration for financial aid. A class action is also superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. The membership of the \nclass can be readily ascertained from records in the possession of Defendants.  Prosecution \nas a class action will eliminate the possibility of repetitious litigation. Treatment of this \ncase as a class action will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate \ntheir  common  claims  in  a  single  forum  simultaneously,  efficiently,  and  without  the \nduplication of effort and expense that numerous individual actions would engender.  Class \ntreatment  will  also  permit  the  adjudication  of  claims  by  many  class  members  who \notherwise could not bear the expense and burden of seeking redress on an individual basis \nfor the conduct alleged herein.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n67.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n68.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: “No \nState shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  \n69.  The Equal Protection Clause applies to state educational institutions. See, \ne.g., Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 307. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 17 of 22\n70.  Racial discrimination is “invidious in all contexts.” Edmonson v. Leesville \nConcrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 619 (1991). So government actors, such as state universities, \nmay not provide a benefit on the basis of race without satisfying strict scrutiny.  \n71.  The Court must first determine whether the racial classification “further[s] \ncompelling governmental interests.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326. “Classifying and assigning” \nstudents based on their race “requires more than . . . an amorphous end to justify it.” Parents \nInvolved  in  Cmty.  Schs.  v.  Seattle  Sch.  Dist.  No.  1,  551  U.S.  701,  735  (2007).  A \n“generalized assertion” of “past discrimination” is insufficient, because it “provides no \nguidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to \nremedy.” City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 498 (1989). \n72.  If a racial classification somehow serves a compelling interest, the Court \nmust then determine whether it is “narrowly tailored”—meaning “necessary”—to that \ninterest. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 311–12. In this context, Defendants must not only show “how \nassigning students to these racial categories and making [financial-aid] decisions based on \nthem furthers the educational benefits that the universities claim to pursue,” but also that \nthe classification has a “logical end point.” SFFA, 600 U.S. at 216, 221 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n73.  The University of Oklahoma’s race-based financial-aid practices fail strict \nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. These practices share all the failings of the \nrace-based admissions practices deemed unlawful in SFFA: they rely on imprecise and \nirrational categories; they assume that members of each racial group are uniform in their \nneed for financial aid and that such aid will have the same effect on each member of the \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 18 of 22\ngroup; and they rest on the demeaning stereotype that black students need financial aid \nmore than non-black students. For all these reasons, Defendants cannot assert a compelling \ninterest in considering “race for race’s sake.” Id. at 220. \n74.  Moreover,  less-restrictive  means  for  easing  financial  burdens  on  black \nstudents are readily available. Simply providing adequate need-based financial aid to all \nstudents, regardless of race, would ensure that black students who have been admitted to \nthe University of Oklahoma are not dissuaded from attending by the cost of doing so. There \nis no legitimate basis for privileging the financial needs of students of one race over the \nfinancial needs of students of other races.  \n75.  Defendants’ wrongful use of race in financial-aid determinations deprives \nPlaintiffs and other Class members of their equal-protection rights. Plaintiffs and other \nClass members are thus entitled to a declaratory judgment.  \n76.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988.  \nCOUNT II \nViolation of Title VI \n(42 U.S.C. § 2000d) \n \n77.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n78.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis \nof race by programs and activities receiving federal funds. Specifically, Section 601 \nprovides: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 19 of 22\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d. \n79.  This provision is privately enforceable. See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 279–80 (2001). \n80.  A  recipient  of  federal  funds  violates  Title  VI  when  it  intentionally \ndiscriminates on the basis of race. See, e.g., Yu v. Idaho State Univ., 15 F.4th 1236, 1242 \n(9th Cir. 2021); Khan v. Midwestern Univ., 147 F. Supp. 3d 718, 720 (N.D. Ill. 2015). Here, \navailable  evidence  indicates  that  race  plays  a  role  in  the  University  of  Oklahoma’s \nfinancial-aid awards. \n81.  Intentional discrimination can also take the form of facially neutral policies, \nspecifically where “the relevant decisionmaker . . . adopted the policy at issue ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.’” Pryor v. Nat’l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 288 F.3d 548, 562 (3rd Cir. 2002) (quoting Pers. Adm’r of Mass. \nv. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)). To the extent Defendants apply facially neutral \npolicies that adversely affect non-black applicants, those policies are subject to Title VI as \nwell. \n82.  Intentional racial discrimination alone violates Title VI. See SFFA, 600 U.S. \nat 309 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). But even if the Court were to apply an interest-balancing \nframework—i.e., strict scrutiny—Defendants would bear the burden of showing that their \ndiscriminatory financial-aid practices survive strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Shaw, 509 U.S. at \n643.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 20 of 22\n83.  “[D]iscrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment committed by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a \nviolation of Title VI.” SFFA, 600 U.S. at 198 n.2 (internal quotation marks omitted). So \nfor the same reasons that the challenged conduct violates the Equal Protection Clause, it \nalso violates Title VI. \n84.  Plaintiffs and the other Class members have suffered damages as a direct and \nproximate  result  of  Defendant  the  University  of  Oklahoma’s  violations  of  Title  VI. \nPlaintiffs are therefore entitled to compensatory damages, to be measured at trial, for any \nand all financial aid that they have been wrongfully deprived of because of their race. \n85.  Defendants’  wrongful  conduct  also  deprives  Plaintiffs  and  other  Class \nmembers of their right to equal treatment, which is protected by Title VI. Plaintiffs and \nother Class members are entitled to a declaratory judgment to prevent Defendants from \ncontinuing any such deprivation.  \n86.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief and judgment as follows:  \n \na.  Certify that this action is a proper class action under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and (b) on behalf of the Class defined herein; \nb.  Declare  that  Defendants’  racially  discriminatory  financial-aid  practices \nviolate the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI;  \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 1     Filed 05/15/24     Page 21 of 22\nc.

For the reasons \nset forth in this Complaint, Plaintiffs and the proposed Class are entitled to declaratory \nrelief and damages. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.” Students for \nFair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 206 (2023) \n(“SFFA”). \n2.  Yet racial preferences continue to exist at the University of Oklahoma. \nRather than determining who to admit based on their race, the University of Oklahoma \ndetermines how much financial aid it gives to students based on their race. That is unlawful. \n3.  Universities that discriminate on the basis of race when making financial-aid \nawards violate the same equal protection principles that apply in the admissions context \nand elsewhere. \n4.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the \ngovernment from considering race when providing public benefits—such as financial \naid—except when the government can satisfy strict scrutiny. This is an exceedingly high \nstandard.  The  government  must  show  that  racial  preferences  serve  a  compelling \ngovernment interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest. No other showing will \nsuffice.  \n5.  And Title VI requires, at minimum, that recipients of federal funding meet \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 3 of 24\n \nthis same exacting standard—strict scrutiny—when using racial classifications. \n6.  Defendants’ use of race to allocate financial-aid resources cannot survive \nstrict scrutiny. Government actors may not “intentionally allocate preference to those ‘who \nmay have little in common with one another but the color of their skin.’” Id. at 220 (quoting \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 647 (1993)). And if Defendants had a cognizable interest in \neasing the financial burden on certain racial groups attending the University of Oklahoma, \nthey could serve that interest by more narrowly tailored means, such as awarding need-\nbased, but race-blind, financial aid. \n7.  Defendants’  race-based  financial-aid  practices  thus  violate  the  Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  They  also  violate  Title VI,  which \nprohibits racial discrimination by all programs receiving federal financial assistance. \n8.  Such violations entitle Plaintiffs and the Class to declaratory relief under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and damages under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n9.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \n10.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because at least one Defendant is a \nresident of this District and all Defendants are residents of Oklahoma, and because a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 4 of 24\n \nPARTIES \n \n11.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson is a resident of Oklahoma and an undergraduate \nstudent in an accelerated master’s degree program at the University of Oklahoma. \n12.  Plaintiff  Logan  Rhines  is  a  resident  of  Oklahoma  and  a  junior  at  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. \n13.  Plaintiff  Kayla  Savage  is  a  resident  of  Oklahoma  and  a  senior  at  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. \n14.  Defendant the University of Oklahoma is a public educational institution \nbased in Norman, Oklahoma. The University of Oklahoma accepts substantial financial \nassistance from the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, for example, the University of \nOklahoma was awarded more than $150 million through federal programs. And in fiscal \nyear 2022, it was awarded more than $70 million.1 The University of Oklahoma also \nreceives financial assistance from the federal government by enrolling students who pay \ntuition, at least in part, with federal financial aid.  \n15.  Defendant Joseph Harroz, Jr. is President of the University of Oklahoma. In \nthat role, he serves as chief executive officer of the University and is ultimately responsible \nfor the University’s financial aid program. Defendant Harroz is sued in his official capacity. \n16.  Defendant Jeff Blahnik is Vice President for the Division of Enrollment \nManagement and Chief Enrollment Officer. In that role, he oversees the University of \nOklahoma’s financial aid department among other responsibilities. Defendant Blahnik is \n \n1   Recipient  Profile,  University  of  Oklahoma,  USASPENDING.GOV, \nhttps://bit.ly/3QsKoVX (last accessed May 1, 2024). \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 5 of 24\n \nsued in his official capacity. \n17.  Defendant  Courtney  Henderson  is  Executive  Director  of  Financial  Aid \nServices at the University of Oklahoma. In that role, she operates the University’s financial \naid program. Defendant Henderson is sued in her official capacity. \n18.  Defendant  Dorion  Billups  is  Director  of  Connection  and  Student \nEngagement at the University of Oklahoma. He served as Director of Diversity Enrichment \nPrograms at the University of Oklahoma until his position was renamed. In his role, Mr. \nBillups works within the Office of Admissions & Recruitment to promote racial diversity, \nincluding through race-conscious financial aid decisions. Defendant Billups is sued in his \nofficial capacity.  \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n \n19.  Equal  protection  prohibits  government  entities—including  public \nuniversities—from distributing benefits or burdens based on race, unless the government \nidentifies a compelling interest and shows that its policy is narrowly tailored to pursue that \ninterest. Racial classifications usually fail under this standard, known as “strict scrutiny.” \nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). The Supreme Court has \nidentified only limited “compelling interests that permit resort to race-based government \naction,” namely “remediating specific, identified instances of past discrimination” and \n“avoiding imminent and serious risks to human safety in prisons, such as a race riot.” SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 207.  \n20.  In Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), the Supreme Court held that \nthe Equal Protection Clause also allowed limited consideration of race in higher-education \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 6 of 24\n \nadmissions. The Court required schools to use an admissions plan “flexible enough to \nensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual.” Id. at 337. Thus, in a related case, \nthe Court rejected an admissions program that “automatically” awarded points to minority \napplicants. Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 271 (2003). The Court further assumed that \nschools would continue to pursue race-neutral options and contemplated that “25 years \nfrom now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest \napproved today.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343. \n21.  The Court later returned to the issue of affirmative action in two cases, both \nnamed Fisher v. University of Texas. In Fisher I, the Court reminded lower courts that \n“strict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before \nturning to racial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not \nsuffice.” Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 312 (2013) (“Fisher I”). Because \nthe trial court had failed to “perform this searching examination,” the Supreme Court \nreversed. Id. at 312–13. In Fisher II, a seven-member Court upheld the University of \nTexas’s consideration of race in admissions based on the unique facts of that case, but \naffirmed that strict scrutiny applies to all government classifications based on race—no \nexceptions. See Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 579 U.S. 365, 377–80 (2016) (“Fisher \nII”).  \n22.  In 2023, the Supreme Court held that the use of race in admissions by \nHarvard College and the University of North Carolina (“UNC”) violated equal-protection \nprinciples. In so doing, the Supreme Court eliminated the special dispensation it had \nprovided for college admissions programs in earlier cases. See SFFA, 600 U.S. at 214–24.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 7 of 24\n \n23.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed its longstanding teaching that race-conscious \n“[u]niversity programs must comply with strict scrutiny.” Id. at 213. And it emphasized \nthat it had “time and again forcefully rejected the notion that government actors may \nintentionally allocate preference to those ‘who may have little in common with one another \nbut the color of their skin.’” Id. at 220 (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 647). \n24.  The Supreme Court has never held that race-based financial-aid decisions \nsatisfy strict scrutiny. \n25.  Racial discrimination in financial aid was illegal before the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in SFFA, and it remains illegal after the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA. That \nis because “[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most \nexact connection between justification and classification.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270 (citation \nomitted). \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nI.  Racial Considerations in Financial Aid at the University of Oklahoma \n26.  The University of Oklahoma is prohibited from using affirmative action \nwhen  making  admissions  decisions.  See  OKLA. CONST.  art.  II,  § 2–36A  (prohibiting \npreferential treatment based on race by state educational institutions). \n27.  Still, the University of Oklahoma places a high value on racial diversity. The \nUniversity monitors the racial statistics of admitted students. And one of the University’s \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 8 of 24\n \nexpress goals is to increase the number of Black students on campus.2 The University has \nalso undertaken intentional efforts to increase the number of Hispanics on campus. \nA.  The University of Oklahoma Operates Many Race-Based Programs \n28.  In an effort to increase racial diversity, the University of Oklahoma operates \nand has operated a host of race conscious programs. These programs, which give race-\nbased  preferences  to  Black  students  and  other  preferred  racial  groups,  begin  before \nmatriculation and continue through graduation.3 \n29.  Prior to student matriculation, certain Black admittees are invited to attend \nthe “McLaurin & Lewis Leadership Conference.”4 This conference is a “college preview \nprogram for African American students” during which they “are introduced to current \nAfrican American student leaders, faculty, staff, and alumni.”5 Selection for the conference \nis race-based. \n30.  If Black students opt to attend the University of Oklahoma, the school then \n \n2   African  American  Students,  UNIV. OF OKLA.,  https://bit.ly/43qZ110  (last  accessed \nMarch 21, 2024) (highlighting that the University “seeks to increase African American \nstudent . . . representation on campus”). \n3   Many of these programs appear, on their face, to be inconsistent with the Oklahoma \nConstitution’s  Bill  of  Rights.  See  OKLA.  CONST.  art.  II,  § 2–36A  (prohibiting \npreferential  treatment  based  on  race  in  the  operation  of  public  education).  The \nUniversity’s basis for operating these programs is unclear. \n4   African American Students, supra, n.2. \n5   McLaurin Lewis Leadership Conference, UNIV.

Our goals are not only to have these students \nattend OU but to become actively involved in the African American community at \nOU.”). \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 9 of 24\n \ninvites them to what it has dubbed “Welcome Black Weekend.”6 According to university \nofficial Angelique Price, “Welcome Black Weekend is a three day orientation for incoming \nor transfer Black students.”7 The racially exclusionary nature of the program is not subtle. \nIn 2022, an official university account advertised the event by declaring, “We’re back and \nblacker than EVER!”8 \n31.  The University of Oklahoma continues to engage in racially discriminatory \nactivities  after  students  are  admitted.  For  example,  the  University  hosts  race-based \nprogramming and activities, sponsored by the University’s Office of African American \nPrograms & Services.9  The University also hosted similar activities for Latino students, \nthought it appears to have deleted numerous webpages describing those activities.10 \n32.  And even at the end of Oklahoma students’ time at the University, race \ncontinues to play a role: The University hosts an annual “Black Excellence Ceremony,” \nwhich  is  designed  to  honor  Black  graduates  only.11  The  University  hosts  a  similar \nceremony for Hispanic students, which the University dubbed its “Latinx Graduation and \n \n6   African American Students, supra n.2. \n7   Houston Williams, Welcome Black Weekend Coming Aug. 26-28, OKLA.

In an effort to obscure the extent to which it has engaged in race-based \ndecision making, the University of Oklahoma has recently deleted many webpages with \ninformation  about  its  diversity  and  race-based  programs.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to \ndetermine the full extent of the University’s race-based programs. \n34.  The University of Oklahoma continued to delete webpages pertaining to its \ndiversity efforts after Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint. \nB.  The University of Oklahoma Considers Race When Awarding Financial \n  Aid \n \n35.  Given the extent to which race has infused the University of Oklahoma’s \ndecision-making processes, it is perhaps unsurprising that the University of Oklahoma also \nawards financial aid based on race. \n36.  The University of Oklahoma advertises on its “Financial Aid” webpage that \nduring the 2022–2023 academic year the average financial aid given to undergraduates was \n$15,747, and that nearly 71% of students received aid of some amount.13 Based on the \nnumber of students at the University of Oklahoma, this amounts to more than $230 million \nin financial assistance.  \n \n12  @DrDavidSurratt,  X  (formerly  known  as  Twitter),  (May  8,  2022,  12:28  am), \nhttps://bit.ly/4dt3Ta0  (University’s  Vice  President  for  Student  Affairs  &  Dean  of \nStudents celebrating this event). \n13  Financial Aid, UNIV.

Students are considered for financial aid and scholarships when they apply \nto the University of Oklahoma through the Common Application, OU Application, or \nApply Coalition with Scoir. On each of these applications, students may indicate their race. \n38.  The University of Oklahoma also considers data submitted through FAFSA. \n39.  These general applications are the primary means by which the University of \nOklahoma awards such aid to students. \n40.  An official from the University of Oklahoma’s Office of Admissions told \nPlaintiff Savage that financial aid was generally not available to students like her—but \nwould have been if she were African American. \n41.  A statistical analysis of publicly available data provides further evidence that \nthe University of Oklahoma considers race when awarding aid to its students.  \n42.  Based on the University of Oklahoma’s published enrollment data, and the \nfinancial-aid data that the University reported to the Department of Education for academic \nyears 2002–2003 through 2021–2022, statistical regression analysis shows that as the \nnumber of Black/Hispanic students increases, the average net cost of attendance price \ndecreases.14 Conversely, as the number of White/Asian students increases, the average net \ncost of attendance price increases. These results are statistically significant. And they \nremain so when using available data to control for family financial resources. \n43.  This statistical analysis is consistent with discrimination stemming from \n \n14  Net cost of attendance includes the costs of attending a university (such as tuition, \nuniversity fees, room and board, and books and supplies) minus institutional aid. It thus \nreflects  the  actual  costs  paid  to  attend  a  university,  factoring  in  discounts  like \ninstitutional grant aid. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 12 of 24\n \naffirmative action policies in university grants that benefit some favored racial groups (in \nthis case, Black/Hispanic students) and harm other disfavored groups (in this case, non-\nBlack/non-Hispanic students). \n44.  The analysis uses data at the university-year level regarding the net price of \ntuition at the institution, the proportion of students enrolled from a group that appears to \nreceive beneficial treatment, and measures of enrolled students receiving federal grant aid \nas a proxy for family financial resources. The analysis also controls for inflation. \n45.  Plaintiffs are aware of no public statement from the University of Oklahoma \ndisclosing that the school systematically discriminates on the basis of race when allocating \nfinancial aid. \n46.  In the absence of this sophisticated statistical analysis, the University of \nOklahoma’s systematic racial discrimination with respect to financial aid would not have \nbecome known. \n47.  Plaintiffs and the Class could not have learned about the University of \nOklahoma’s systematic racial discrimination at an earlier date through the exercise of \nreasonable diligence. \n48.  The University of Oklahoma’s racial discrimination with respect to financial \naid is consistent with recent peer-reviewed econometric research showing that American \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 13 of 24\n \ncolleges and universities have, in the recent past, provided racial discounts when awarding \nfinancial aid.15 \nII.  Effect of the University of Oklahoma’s Racial Discrimination on Plaintiffs \n49.  The University of Oklahoma has a limited pool of money from which to \naward all forms of financial aid. \n50.  Because of Defendants’ race-based financial aid decision making, Plaintiffs \nreceived less financial aid from the University of Oklahoma than they would have if the \nUniversity of Oklahoma did not discriminate on the basis of race when awarding financial \naid. \nA.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson \n51.  Plaintiff Brayden Johnson is an undergraduate student in an accelerated \nmaster’s degree program at the University of Oklahoma. Because Plaintiff Johnson does \nnot have the financial means to pay for college, he applied for scholarships from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma.  \n52.  Plaintiff Johnson self-identified as White and non-Hispanic when applying \nfor financial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n53.  Plaintiff Johnson received a merit scholarship in the amount of $4,000 per \nyear and two smaller scholarships totaling $1,000 and $1,750 per year, respectively. \n \n15  Ian Fillmore, Price Discrimination and Public Policy in the US College Market, 90 (3) \nTHE REV. OF ECON. STUD., 1228, 1240 & tbl. 2 (2023) (finding a statistically significant \nrelationship between Black and Hispanic students and tuition discounts using a robust \n2007–2008 data set). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 14 of 24\n \nPlaintiff Johnson did not receive any other scholarships or financial aid from the University \nof Oklahoma. \n54.  Plaintiff Johnson would have received additional financial aid  from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \n55.  To support himself while at the University of Oklahoma, Plaintiff Johnson \nworks at Home Depot three days a week. He previously worked as a cashier at a bagel shop \nfor the same reason. \nB.  Plaintiff Logan Rhines \n56.  Plaintiff Logan Rhines is a junior at the University of Oklahoma. He is a \nfirst-generation college student. Because Plaintiff Rhines does not have the financial means \nto pay for college, he applied for scholarships from the University of Oklahoma.  \n57.  Plaintiff Rhines identified himself as White and non-Hispanic when applying \nfor financial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n58.  Plaintiff Rhines received a merit scholarship based on his ACT score and \nGPA in the amount of $1,000 per semester. Plaintiff Rhines did not receive any other \nscholarships or financial aid from the University of Oklahoma. \n59.  Plaintiff  Rhines  would  have  received  additional  financial  aid  from  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \nC.  Plaintiff Kayla Savage \n60.  Plaintiff Kayla Savage is a senior at the University of Oklahoma. Plaintiff \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 15 of 24\n \nSavage transferred to the University of Oklahoma after attending community college.  \n61.  An official from the University of Oklahoma’s Office of Admissions told \nPlaintiff Savage that financial aid was generally not available to students like her—but \nwould have been if she were African American. \n62.  Because Plaintiff Savage did not have the financial means to pay for college, \nshe nonetheless applied for scholarships from the University of Oklahoma.  \n63.  Plaintiff Savage self-identified as White and non-Hispanic when applying for \nfinancial aid from the University of Oklahoma.  \n64.  Plaintiff Savage received no financial aid from the University of Oklahoma. \n65.  Plaintiff  Savage  would  have  received  additional  financial  aid  from  the \nUniversity of Oklahoma if the Defendants did not engage in racial discrimination when \nawarding financial aid. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n66.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and other current, former, \nand  incoming  University  of  Oklahoma  students  similarly  entitled  to  damages  and \ndeclaratory relief.  \n67.  The Class consists of all current, future, and former undergraduate students \nof the University of Oklahoma who were enrolled at any time from the date that the \nUniversity of Oklahoma began systematically discriminating in favor of Black/Hispanic \nstudents when awarding financial aid to the date of class certification, who did not receive \nfinancial  aid  covering  all  costs  of  attendance,  who  were  U.S.  citizens  or  permanent \nresidents, who applied for financial aid, and who are not identified in the school’s financial \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 16 of 24\n \naid  or  admissions  database  as  Black,  African  American,  Hispanic,  Latino  or  any \nsubstantively similar label. These Class members are seeking damages from Defendant the \nUniversity of Oklahoma under Title VI, and a declaratory judgment declaring that their \nrights were violated under both Title VI and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n68.  The Class shall exclude any judicial officers presiding over this action, as \nwell as members of their immediate families and members of their judicial staffs. The Class \nshall also exclude any attorney appearing in this action and any juror assigned to this action, \nas well as members of their immediate families. \n69.  The  proposed  Class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1). The exact number of Class members is \nunknown at this time and can be ascertained only through appropriate discovery. But given \nthe number of students who attend and apply for financial aid from the University of \nOklahoma every year, there are at least thousands of members of the proposed Class. \n70.  Common questions of law and fact exist with respect to the Class. See FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(a)(2). Those questions include: \na.  Whether Defendants denied financial aid to the Class members on the basis \nof their race (both Counts); \nb.  Whether  Defendants’  challenged  conduct  violates  the  Equal  Protection \nClause (Count I); and \nc.  Whether the University of Oklahoma’s challenged conduct violates Title VI \n(Count II).  \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 17 of 24\n \n71.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the other Class members. See FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(a)(3). All members of the Class currently attend, have attended, or will attend \nthe University of Oklahoma and are being denied, were denied, or will be denied financial \naid on the basis of race. They were thus similarly affected by the wrongful conduct \ncomplained of herein. \n72.  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of  all  Class \nmembers. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(4). Plaintiffs’ counsel is competent and experienced in \nclass and civil rights litigation, and Plaintiffs have no interests adverse or antagonistic to \nthe Class. \n73.  The Class is certifiable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The \ncommon questions of law and fact listed above predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members of the Class. All Class members are entitled to similarly race-\nblind consideration for financial aid. A class action is also superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. The membership of the \nclass can be readily ascertained from records in the possession of Defendants.  Prosecution \nas a class action will eliminate the possibility of repetitious litigation. Treatment of this \ncase as a class action will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate \ntheir  common  claims  in  a  single  forum  simultaneously,  efficiently,  and  without  the \nduplication of effort and expense that numerous individual actions would engender.  Class \ntreatment  will  also  permit  the  adjudication  of  claims  by  many  class  members  who \notherwise could not bear the expense and burden of seeking redress on an individual basis \nfor the conduct alleged herein.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 18 of 24\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nAsserted Against Defendants Harroz Jr., Blahnik, Henderson, and Billups \nViolation of the Equal Protection Clause \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n74.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n75.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: “No \nState shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.  \n76.  The Equal Protection Clause applies to state educational institutions and their \nofficers and employees. See, e.g., Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 307. \n77.  Racial discrimination is “invidious in all contexts.” Edmonson v. Leesville \nConcrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 619 (1991). So government actors, such as state universities \nand their officers and employees, may not provide a benefit on the basis of race without \nsatisfying strict scrutiny.  \n78.  The Court must first determine whether the racial classification “further[s] \ncompelling governmental interests.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326. “Classifying and assigning” \nstudents based on their race “requires more than . . . an amorphous end to justify it.” Parents \nInvolved  in  Cmty.  Schs.  v.  Seattle  Sch.  Dist.  No.  1,  551  U.S.  701,  735  (2007).  A \n“generalized assertion” of “past discrimination” is insufficient, because it “provides no \nguidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to \nremedy.” City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 498 (1989). \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 19 of 24\n \n79.  If a racial classification somehow serves a compelling interest, the Court \nmust then determine whether it is “narrowly tailored”—meaning “necessary”—to that \ninterest. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 311–12. In this context, Defendants must not only show “how \nassigning students to these racial categories and making [financial-aid] decisions based on \nthem furthers the educational benefits that the universities claim to pursue,” but also that \nthe classification has a “logical end point.” SFFA, 600 U.S. at 216, 221 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n80.  The University of Oklahoma’s race-based financial-aid practices fail strict \nscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. These practices share all the failings of the \nrace-based admissions practices deemed unlawful in SFFA: they rely on imprecise and \nirrational categories; they assume that members of each racial group are uniform in their \nneed for financial aid and that such aid will have the same effect on each member of the \ngroup; and they rest on the demeaning stereotype that  Black/Hispanic students need \nfinancial aid more than non-Black/non-Hispanic students. For all these reasons, Defendants \ncannot assert a compelling interest in considering “race for race’s sake.” Id. at 220. \n81.  Defendants  also  lack  a  compelling  interest  in  considering  race  when \nawarding aid because Oklahoma’s Constitution prohibits the University of Oklahoma from \nengaging in such practices.  See OKLA. CONST. art. II, § 2–36A. \n82.  Moreover,  less-restrictive  means  for  easing  financial  burdens  on \nBlack/Hispanic  students are  readily available.  Simply providing adequate  need-based \nfinancial aid to all students, regardless of race, would ensure that Black/Hispanic students \nwho have been admitted to the University of Oklahoma are not dissuaded from attending \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 20 of 24\n \nby the cost of doing so. There is no legitimate basis for privileging the financial needs of \nstudents of one race over the financial needs of students of other races. This is true in all \ncontexts.   \n83.  Defendants’ wrongful use of race in financial-aid determinations deprives \nPlaintiffs and other Class members of their equal-protection rights. Plaintiffs and other \nClass members are thus entitled to a declaratory judgment.  \n84.  Plaintiffs are also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988.  \nCOUNT II \nAsserted Against the University of Oklahoma \nViolation of Title VI \n(42 U.S.C. § 2000d) \n \n85.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth herein. \n86.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis \nof race by programs and activities receiving federal funds. Specifically, Section 601 \nprovides: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d. \n87.  This provision is privately enforceable. See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 279–80 (2001). \n88.  A  recipient  of  federal  funds  violates  Title  VI  when  it  intentionally \ndiscriminates on the basis of race. See, e.g., Yu v. Idaho State Univ., 15 F.4th 1236, 1242 \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 21 of 24\n \n(9th Cir. 2021); Khan v. Midwestern Univ., 147 F. Supp. 3d 718, 720 (N.D. Ill. 2015).  \n89.  The University of Oklahoma violated Title VI by considering students’ race \nwhen awarding financial aid. \n90.  Intentional discrimination can also take the form of facially neutral policies, \nspecifically where “the relevant decisionmaker . . . adopted the policy at issue ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.’” Pryor v. Nat’l \nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 288 F.3d 548, 562 (3rd Cir. 2002) (quoting Pers. Adm’r of Mass. \nv. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)). To the extent Defendants apply facially neutral \npolicies that adversely affect non-Black/non-Hispanic applicants, those policies are subject \nto Title VI as well. \n91.  Intentional racial discrimination alone violates Title VI. See SFFA, 600 U.S. \nat 309 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). But even if the Court were to apply an interest-balancing \nframework—i.e., strict scrutiny—the University of Oklahoma would bear the burden of \nshowing that its discriminatory financial-aid practices survive strict scrutiny. See, e.g., \nShaw, 509 U.S. at 643.  \n92.  “[D]iscrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment committed by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a \nviolation of Title VI.” SFFA, 600 U.S. at 198 n.2 (internal quotation marks omitted). So \nfor the same reasons that the challenged conduct violates the Equal Protection Clause, it \nalso violates Title VI. \n93.  Plaintiffs and the other Class members have suffered damages as a direct and \nproximate  result  of  Defendant  the  University  of  Oklahoma’s  violations  of  Title  VI. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 22 of 24\n \nPlaintiffs are therefore entitled to compensatory damages, to be measured at trial, for any \nand all financial aid that they have been wrongfully deprived of because of their race. \n94.  The University of Oklahoma’s wrongful conduct also deprives Plaintiffs and \nother Class members of their right to equal treatment, which is protected by Title VI. \nPlaintiffs and other Class members are entitled to a declaratory judgment to prevent the \nUniversity of Oklahoma from continuing any such deprivation.  \n95.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1988. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief and judgment as follows:  \n \na.  Certify that this action is a proper class action under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and (b) on behalf of the Class defined herein; \nb.  Declare  that  Defendants’  racially  discriminatory  financial-aid  practices \nviolate the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI;  \nc.  Award  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  members  compensatory  damages  for \nDefendant the University of Oklahoma’s violation of Title VI, in an amount to be proven \nat trial, including interest thereon;  \nd.  Award Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \ne.  Order such further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 42     Filed 08/05/24     Page 23 of 24\n \nRespectfully submitted,        Dated: August 5, 2024 \n/s/ Ryan Haynie   \nRyan Haynie, OBA No. 32796  David H.

Further, Plaintiffs \ncannot state a Title VI claim against the University Officials because Title VI only applies \nto the University, as an entity, and the Ex parte Young fiction is irrelevant for the Title VI \nclaim because the University is subject to injunctive relief, in the event such relief is ap-\npropriate (here it is not). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs simply fail to state viable claims under the Equal Protection \nClause or Title VI because Plaintiffs do not plead facts establishing that the University \nengaged in, or presently engages in, intentional race discrimination in the awarding of \n   \n\nCase 5:24-cv-00495-PRW     Document 21     Filed 07/15/24     Page 2 of 3\n \nfinancial aid. Further, Plaintiffs do not plead facts to demonstrate they were personally \ndeprived of financial aid because of their race. Plaintiffs’ failure to plead facts supporting \na personal injury resulting from intentional race discrimination, in addition to negating a \nkey element of their claims for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), also prevents Plaintiffs from \nestablishing Article III standing, necessitating dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). \nWherefore, Defendants respectfully move this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Com-\nplaint, in its entirety, pursuant to Fed.

Further, Plaintiffs \ncannot state a Title VI claim against the University Officials because Title VI only applies \nto the University, as an entity, and the Ex parte Young fiction is irrelevant for the Title VI \nclaim because the University is subject to injunctive relief, in the event such relief is ap-\npropriate (here it is not). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs simply fail to state viable claims under the Equal Protection \nClause or Title VI because Plaintiffs do not plead facts establishing that the University \nengaged in, or presently engages in, intentional race discrimination in the awarding of \n   ",
