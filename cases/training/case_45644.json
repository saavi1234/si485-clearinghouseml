On May 15, 2024, five nursing home residents filed this putative class action lawsuit against Maryland's Department of Health (MDOH) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Plaintiffs sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that MDOH failed to conduct annual inspections of Medicaid- and Medicare-funded nursing facilities and allowed a backlog of complaints to accumulate, leaving residents with disabilities especially vulnerable. Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that MDOH failed to re-certify facilities for over four years, failed to conduct routine annual checks, and postponed investigation of all but the most urgent complaints until the following year's survey. Plaintiffs argued that these failures impeded the purposes of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act and therefore violated the statutes' implementing regulations. Represented by Public Justice Center and Justice in Aging, Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction requiring Defendants to speed up the process of nursing home inspections, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to District Judge Matthew J. Maddox.</p>\r\n<p>On July 19, 2024, Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of \"residents of nursing facilities, who have disabilities with mobility impairment, and who live in nursing facilities that operate under the oversight authority of MDH.\"&nbsp; A few days later, on July 22, MDH moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.</p>\r\n<p>As of December 27, 2024, the motions to dismiss and for class certification are pending.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiffs,1 and the class they seek to represent, are nursing facility \nresidents with mobility impairments living in Medicaid- and Medicare-\nparticipating facilities (“Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs surrendered life in their community \nin favor of placement in an institutional care setting to ensure that they receive the \n \n1 Plaintiffs are concurrently filing a Motion to File under Seal and Proceed under \nPseudonyms, due to the sensitive and highly personal nature of the details in this \ncomplaint, and concerns of retaliation for filing this suit from the nursing facilities \nin which they reside. The Memorandum of Law filed in support of that motion \nexplains these reasons more fully. The publicly filed case caption states their \npseudonyms. \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 2 of 50\nround-the-clock medical care and assistance with toileting, hygiene, mobility, and \nother activities of daily living that they need to maintain their health, safety, and \ndignity. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) is the government entity \ncharged with regularly entering Maryland’s nursing facilities to assess their \noperations and to ensure compliance with federal and state quality of care \nstandards. Despite the importance of its oversight responsibilities, MDH has \nallowed more than 100 nursing facilities to go four years without an annual \ninspection (known as a “survey”),2 with many more facilities overdue for an \nannual survey, and has allowed a backlog of thousands of uninvestigated \ncomplaints3 from nursing facility residents to pile up. When MDH fails to carry out \nits oversight responsibilities, dangerously poor-quality care within nursing \nfacilities goes undetected and uncorrected.  \n2.  For years, MDH has failed to conduct statutorily-mandated annual \nsurveys or act on Plaintiffs’ complaints within statutorily-prescribed time frames. \nAs a result, Maryland’s nursing facilities have not been held accountable when \n \n2 “Annual survey,” as used in this case, is intended to include the full process of \ninspection, identification of deficiencies, and resolution of any deficiencies found \nin a given nursing facility, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(1)(A), (h).  \n3 “Complaint investigation,” as used in this case, is intended to include the full \nprocess of investigation, identification of deficiencies, and resolution of any \ndeficiencies related to the complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(4), § \n1396r(h). \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 3 of 50\nthey fail to meet mandated federal and state standards related to resident rights, \nquality of care, and staffing. Because of Plaintiffs’ mobility impairments, this lack \nof accountability leaves Plaintiffs in situations where they are vulnerable to neglect \nand mistreatment, which lead to pressure ulcers, falls, and unnecessary seclusion. \nPlaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer personal degradation and significant \nphysical and psychosocial harm as a result of Defendants’ failures. \n3.  MDH operates its mandated program of nursing facility oversight and \nenforcement to ensure that covered nursing facilities recognize and honor the rights \nof residents. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g); Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-1408. \nThrough this oversight role, MDH acts as the State’s designated eyes and ears to \nassess quality of care in nursing facilities. MDH’s program of annual surveys and \ncomplaint investigations in nursing facilities, related plans of correction to cure \nany deficiencies, and enforcement through appropriate remedial action are \ndesigned to ensure that conditions violative of residents’ rights are effectively \naddressed. \n4.  MDH’s performance in timely completing annual surveys is among \nthe worst among the states. Its failure has left the residents of a vast majority of the \nstate’s nursing facilities without the benefit of annual surveys designed to protect \ntheir rights.  \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 4 of 50\n5.  Similarly, MDH has failed to investigate Plaintiffs’ complaints within \nmandated time frames. Many serious complaints alleging harm go uninvestigated \nfor months or years, leaving the residents across nursing facilities without an \nindependent governmental review of allegations related to neglect and other \nviolations of resident rights.  \n6.  Plaintiffs do not receive the benefit of state oversight when the survey \nand complaint investigation processes and corrective action process called for in \nfederal and state law do not occur, leaving nursing facilities to violate Plaintiffs’ \nrights with impunity. \n7.  Plaintiffs are uniquely impacted by this vicious cycle. Due to their \nmobility impairments, Plaintiffs rely to a greater extent than other residents on the \nnursing facility to provide essential care. For example, Plaintiffs must rely on \nnursing staff assistance on a daily basis to leave their rooms and interact with \nothers, to take a shower, for toileting and incontinence care, to receive needed pain \nmedicine, and even to have a drink of water. Where that care is lacking, Plaintiffs \nexperience higher levels of harm, including skin problems such as skin breakdown \nand pressure sores, falls, and seclusion relative to residents without mobility \nimpairments. They experience personal loss of dignity when their hygiene and \nincontinence needs are not met by the nursing facility. \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 5 of 50\n8.  The heightened nature of Plaintiffs’ care needs stem from their \nmobility impairments and result in increased demand for the time of facility staff. \nWhen the facility is short-staffed, Plaintiffs are uniquely vulnerable to neglect \nwhen those care needs are not met.  \n9.  Many of Maryland’s nursing facilities have a record of repeated poor \nperformance over numerous review cycles. This is particularly true of nursing \nfacilities located in Black communities.  \n10.  MDH’s methods of administering its nursing facility oversight \nprogram deny Plaintiffs meaningful enforcement of their federal rights delineated \nin the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(1)(A), and their \nstate rights found in the Resident Bill of Rights Act, Md. Code Ann., Health – \nGen., § 19-343, because of their disability. MDH’s disability discrimination results \nin a failure to detect and address violations within nursing facilities, and as a result \nPlaintiffs suffer unique and unaddressed harm due to the nature of their disability. \nAs such, MDH’s administration of the program defeats the purpose of or \nsubstantially impairs the accomplishment of nursing facility oversight and \nenforcement of federal and state protections for Plaintiffs. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This action is brought pursuant to Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 6 of 50\nAct (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794.

Federal law requires also MDH to investigate complaints relating to \nnursing facility services. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(1)(C), (g)(4).  \n24.  The central purpose of the federal annual surveys and complaint \ninvestigation requirements is to “improve the quality of care for Medicaid-eligible \nnursing home residents, and either to bring substandard facilities into compliance \nwith Medicaid quality of care requirements or to exclude them from the program.” \nStaff of Subcomm. on Health and the Env’t of the H.R. Comm. on Energy and \nCom., 100th Cong., 1st Sess., Rep. on Medicare and Medicaid Health Budget \nReconciliation Amendments of 1987, 77 (Comm. Print 1987). \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 9 of 50\n25.  The focus of these federal protections is to ensure that residents \nreceive quality care: “The purpose of the unannounced ‘annual’ standard survey is \nnot to determine whether every nursing facility is in compliance with every \nrequirement of participation. Instead, its purpose is to detect facilities where \nresidents are not receiving quality care.” Id at 93. This focus on ensuring that \nnursing facilities meet the needs of residents became part of the implementing \nregulations. “The survey process uses resident and patient outcomes as the primary \nmeans to establish . . . compliance . . . . Specifically, surveyors will directly \nobserve the actual provision of care and services to residents . . . , and the effects of \nthat care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of the individual \nresidents . . . .” 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(2).  \n26.  There are three objectives for the complaint investigatory process. The \nfirst is protective oversight to identify and respond to allegations that appear to \npose the greatest potential for harming residents. The second is prevention in cases \nwhere serious harm has not been alleged, to identify and correct less serious \ncomplaints and prevent escalation of those problems and potential for future harm. \nThe third is promotion of efficiency and quality within the health care delivery \nsystem. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Ch. 5 - Complaint \nProcedures, State Operations Manual (SOM) 6 (Rev. 212, Feb. 10, 2023) \n[hereinafter SOM, Ch. 5]. \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 10 of 50\n27.  Complaints are triaged as “Immediate Jeopardy” when they allege that \nthe facility has failed to meet one or more federal health, safety, and/or quality \nregulations; and where as a result, serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment, \nor death has occurred, is occurring, or is likely to occur to one or more identified \nresidents-at-risk; and where there is a need for immediate corrective action to \nprevent such harms from occurring or recurring. Id. at 15. Under federal guidance, \nMDH is required to initiate an onsite investigation of a complaint alleging \nImmediate Jeopardy within three business days. Id. at 23. \n28.  Complaints alleging a provider’s noncompliance that “may have \ncaused harm that negatively impacts [a resident]’s mental, physical and/or \npsychosocial status and are of such consequence to the [resident]’s well-being that \na rapid response by the SA [survey agency] is indicated” are triaged as “Non-\nImmediate Jeopardy – High” or “high priority.” Id. at 17. For such high priority \ncomplaints, MDH “must initiate an onsite survey within an annual average of 15 \nbusiness days of receipt of the initial report, not to exceed 18 business days.” Id. \n29.  The facts available when the complaint is triaged by MDH determine \nwhether a complaint alleging harm is characterized as Immediate Jeopardy or high \npriority. Where there continues to be an immediate risk of serious harm or death, \nthe complaint should be triaged as Immediate Jeopardy, and an investigation must \nbe initiated within three business days. Where there is no longer on-going risk of \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 11 of 50\nfurther harm necessitating immediate action, the complaint is to be identified as \nhigh priority and must be investigated within fifteen days under federal law. \n30.  Federal law requires MDH to establish procedures and maintain \nadequate staff to investigate complaints of violations. 42 C.F.R. § 488.332(a)(1). \nFurther, MDH must review all allegations of resident neglect and abuse or \nmisappropriation of resident property and follow procedures specified in 42 C.F.R. \n§ 488.332. 42 C.F.R. § 488.335(a)(3); see also SOM, Ch. 5, at 7. While federal law \nprovides the “maximum time frames” to investigate complaints from nursing \nfacility residents, when a state’s “time frames for the investigation of a \ncomplaint/incident are more stringent than the Federal time frames, the intake is \nprioritized using the State’s timeframes [sic].” SOM, Ch. 5, at 7.  \nii.  State Law \n31.  In addition to federal law requirements, Maryland state law also \nrequires oversight of all licensed nursing facilities, including annual surveys and \ncomplaint investigations.  \n32.  Maryland law requires MDH to conduct a full survey of each licensed \nnursing facility at least once per calendar year. Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. \n§ 19-1408(a)(1). \n33.  MDH is also charged with conducting investigations stemming from \nnursing facility complaints. Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-1408(b). \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 12 of 50\n34.  Under state law, MDH has specific time frames within which it must \ninitiate an on-site investigation, depending on the severity of the allegations in the \ncomplaint. For the most serious allegations involving immediate jeopardy to a \nresident, MDH must initiate its investigation within 48 hours of receipt of the \ncomplaint, but must make “every effort” to investigate within 24 hours of receipt. \nMd. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-1408(b)(2)(i), (ii). \n35.  Maryland law further requires that complaints which allege that a \nresident experienced actual harm that do not involve immediate jeopardy concerns, \nMDH “shall initiate an investigation . . . within 10 business days after receiving the \ncomplaint.” Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-1408(b)(1). \n36.  When MDH determines that the nursing facility has failed to ensure \nthat resident rights are protected or that it has failed to meet quality care standards, \namong other potential failures, it cites the nursing facility with a deficiency. When \nciting a deficiency, MDH determines whether a resident experienced harm (the \nlevel of severity), as well as the number of residents impacted or potentially \nimpacted (the scope). \n37.  MDH has many tools available under state and federal law to remedy \ndeficiencies and enforce resident rights. Nursing facilities can face the potential \nloss of Medicaid funds during the period that they are out of compliance. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396r(h)(1). Depending on the seriousness of the deficiencies, nursing facilities \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 13 of 50\nalso can be subject to Sanction or Corrective Enforcement Actions, including fines, \ninstallation of temporary outside management for the facility, state monitoring, \ntransfer of residents, a directed plan of correction, termination of the facility’s \nprovider agreement, and closure of the facility. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h)(2); 42 C.F.R. \n§ 488.406; Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-1402(a). \n38.  The annual surveys form one of the three foundations for assessing a \nnursing facility’s performance rating, ranging from one (1) to five (5) stars, which \nare posted publicly and on the CMS Care Compare website. Centers for Medicare \n& Medicaid Services, Design for Care Compare Nursing Home Five-Star Quality \nRating System: Technical Users’ Guide 1 (Apr. 2024) [hereinafter Five-Star Rating \nGuide]; 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(5)(A), (i)(1)(A)(ii).  \n39.  Each facility’s star-rating is based on facility-reported information on \nquality, on staffing data based on payroll reporting, and on the results of the \nfacility’s annual survey, with the results from the annual survey weighted the most \nheavily. Five-Star Rating Guide at 1. \n40.  The star rating is intended to be a resource to the public in deciding \nwhere to receive long-term care for themselves or their family members. Id. \nb.  MDH’s Oversight and Enforcement Activities Must Be in Compliance \nwith the ADA and Section 504  \n41.  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with \ndisabilities, stating that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 14 of 50\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n42.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance, stating “[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or \nhis disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n43.  Courts have recognized that protections afforded disabled people \nunder the ADA and Section 504 mirror one another. Legal claims brought under \nboth the ADA and Section 504 based upon the same set of facts are generally \nconsidered in tandem.  \n44.  The ADA and Section 504 prohibit programs from discriminating \nagainst individuals with disabilities, and similarly prohibit discrimination against \nclasses of individuals with disabilities, with respect to the opportunity to access the \nfull range of benefits or services provided by the program. See 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b). \n45.  Congress’s express purpose in enacting the ADA was “to provide a \nclear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities,” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1), including \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 15 of 50\ndiscrimination related to institutionalization and discrimination in health services, \n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3). Congress found that discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities includes the failure to make modifications to existing facilities and \npractices, and relegation to lesser services and programs. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5).  \n46.  Both the ADA’s implementing regulations and Section 504’s \nimplementing regulations prohibit discriminatory methods of administering public \nprograms. Specifically, a “public entity may not, directly or through contractual or \nother arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration: . . . (ii) That have \nthe purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii); see also id. § 35.130(b)(3)(i); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 84.4(b)(4).  \n47.  MDH’s duties under the ADA are proactive. State programs and those \nthat receive federal financial assistance must not only remedy discrimination once \nit has occurred; they also have an affirmative duty to modify “policies, practices, or \nprocedures” to “avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.” 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(7); see also 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(a).  \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 16 of 50\nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \na.  Overview of Maryland’s Nursing Facility Population \n48.  Maryland has 225 licensed nursing facilities that participate in \nMedicaid or Medicare. MDH is charged with certifying annually that each of these \nfacilities is in compliance with federal requirements and therefore eligible to \nparticipate in the Medicaid and Medicare programs. \n49.  Nursing facilities in Maryland provide care to residents requiring \n“maximal nursing care.” Md. Code Ann. Health – Gen. § 19-1401(e). \n50.  According to CMS data, there are at least 9,056 people with mobility \nimpairment residing in nursing facilities in Maryland. See CMS, Minimum Data \nSet Frequency, Q1 2024, Data.CMS.gov, https://data.cms.gov/quality-of-\ncare/minimum-data-set-frequency/data (last visited May 13, 2024) (the number of \npersons requiring “Extensive assistance” or “Total dependence” for MDS Item \nQuestion/Description “G0110B1: Functional Status - Activities of Daily Living \n(ADL) Assistance - Transfer - Self Performance”). Many Maryland nursing facility \nresidents with mobility limitations need assistance with numerous care tasks: 86% \nrequire help from one or more staff members to get into or out of bed, 54% require \nthe help of another to eat a meal, and 94% require help from one or more staff \nmembers to toilet. Id. These care needs reflect the heightened reliance that \nPlaintiffs have on staff assistance.  \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 17 of 50\n51.  In fiscal year 2022, there were 51,656 residents in nursing facilities in \nMaryland; statewide, 35.7% of them were identified as Black residents. Center for \nQuality Measurement and Reporting, Maryland Health Care Commission, Nursing \nHome Utilization 2022, at 2 (Feb. 2023), \nhttps://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/apcd/apcd_quality/documents/CQM_LTC_\nNH_CY2021_Utilization_TABLES_20230228.pdf (last visited May 13, 2024). \n52.  The percentage of Black residents varies by county or region. In \nBaltimore City, 62.9% of nursing facility residents are Black. Id. at 2. Meanwhile, \nBaltimore City has just six nursing facilities that provide care to ventilator-\ndependent people. Maryland Quality Reporting: Nursing Homes, Maryland Health \nCare Commission, \nhttps://healthcarequality.mhcc.maryland.gov/NursingHome/List?searchBy=name&\nsCol=name&sDir=ASC&countyCode=510&hasVentilatorSvc=true (last visited \nMay 14, 2024). All of these facilities have majority Black resident populations and \nare low-performing 1- or 2-star facilities. \n53.  Many 1- and 2-star facilities have a poor record of ensuring residents \nreceive care in accord with their federal and state rights, and Black nursing facility \nresidents are often in 1- or 2-star facilities. \n \n \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 18 of 50\nb.  MDH Has Not Conducted Annual Surveys in a Vast Majority of \nNursing Facilities \n54.  According to CMS data, MDH has not completed an annual survey in \n181 of Maryland’s 225 licensed nursing facilities in the last sixteen (16) months. \nThese uninspected facilities account for 81.5% of nursing facilities in Maryland. \nSee Overdue Recertification Surveys Report, Quality, Certification and Oversight \nReports (QCOR), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nhttps://qcor.cms.gov/main.jsp (last visited May 13, 2024). \n55.  Maryland is one of only four states in the country that have failed to \nconduct annual surveys in over 70% of their nursing facilities; in this regard, only \none other state (Kentucky) is more delinquent than Maryland. Id. \n56.  Many facilities have not had an annual certification survey for years. \nAs of May 13, 2024, over 100 nursing facilities have not been surveyed by MDH \nduring the past four years. Id. \n57.  MDH’s failure to conduct annual surveys is concerning where \nfacilities with a prior history of numerous deficiencies, a history of resident abuse \nand neglect, patterns of failures to provide residents with quality care, and \nviolations of residents’ rights are not regularly monitored. Without annual surveys, \nany new rights violations in these troubled facilities may never come to MDH’s \nattention, unless a complaint is made. \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 19 of 50\nc.  Plaintiffs’ Complaints Are Uninvestigated and Unaddressed \n58.  MDH has a backlog of complaints that have not been investigated. \nOver the past three fiscal years, MDH reported approximately 13,173 complaints \nand facility-reported incidents, including serious allegations of harm to residents, \nof which fewer than half have been investigated. Maryland Department of Health \nOffice of Health Care Quality, Annual Report and Staffing Analysis Fiscal Year \n2023, at 9 (2024). \n59.  Rather than following state and federal maximum time frames for \ninitiating a complaint investigation, MDH regularly allows all but those complaints \ntriaged as immediate jeopardy to await investigation until the facility’s next annual \nsurvey. This results in nursing facility residents waiting months, or even years, for \ntheir complaints that they were harmed by abuse, neglect, poor-quality care, or \nrights violations, to be investigated.  \n60.  Plaintiffs are harmed by these delayed complaint investigations. \nDelays between the incident and the investigation often result in a finding of no \nviolations and no citations due only to difficulties locating documents, staff \nturnover, or the subsequent discharge or death of the resident. \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 20 of 50\nd.  MDH Surveys Are Designed to Address Violations of Plaintiffs’ \nRights \n61.  When MDH surveyors conduct their annual reviews, they look at \nresident rights, quality of life, medication management, skin care, the resident \nassessments, and other compliance areas. \n62.  In doing so, MDH can identify rights violations including, but not \nlimited to, the failure to treat residents with respect and dignity (28 C.F.R. § \n483.10; Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-343(b)(2)(i)), insufficient nursing staff \n(28 C.F.R. § 483.35; COMAR 10.07.02.19), physical, sexual, and verbal abuse (28 \nC.F.R. § 483.12; Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-343(b)(2)(iv)), failure to \nprovide care pursuant to the plan of care (28 C.F.R. 483.10(c)(2)(vi); Md. Code \nAnn., Health – Gen. § 19-343(b)(2)(ii)), and failure to provide assistance \ncompleting activities of daily living, such as bathing, toileting, transferring, and \nambulation (28 C.F.R. § 483.24; Md. Code Ann., Health – Gen. § 19-\n343(b)(2)(ii)). \n63.  Plaintiffs’ mobility impairment can impact their ability to move from \na lying position or turn from side to side in bed. Their Plans of Care regularly \nrequire periodic repositioning, assistance with getting into or out of their bed, and \nhelp using the bathroom or attending to incontinence care. Plans of Care also \naddress any assistance needed in leaving their room to socialize and engage with \nthe community in or outside the facility.  \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 21 of 50\n64.  Plaintiffs’ reliance on facility staff to meet daily care needs leaves \nthem feeling uniquely vulnerable to retaliation for grievances and complaints. \nMDH surveyors are charged with ensuring that nursing facilities “tak[e] immediate \naction to prevent further potential violations of any resident right while the alleged \nviolation is being investigated.” 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(j)(4)(iii). \ne.  MDH Fails to Ensure Plaintiffs’ Rights Are Honored  \n65.  The nursing facilities where the Named Plaintiffs reside have failed to \nprotect their rights or ensure the implementation of their Plans of Care.  \n66.  Had MDH complied with its oversight obligations through annual \ninspections and timely complaint investigations, it would have reviewed records, \nmet with personnel, and spoken with residents. The failure to engage in this \nprocess means that MDH is unaware of these violations in facilities. The discovery \nof such violations would mandate MDH’s implementation of corrective action, \nincluding the implementation and enforcement of a facility plan of correction.  \nIrene Connor \n67.  Ms. Connor is a fifty-four-year-old Black woman who is diagnosed \nwith a wedge compression of her first lumbar vertebra and muscular dystrophy. \nShe relies upon a wheelchair for mobility. She also has diagnoses of acute and \nchronic respiratory failure, dysphagia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 22 of 50\nstress disorder, and asthma. She depends upon a ventilator for respiration for a \nportion of the day and has a tracheostomy.  \n68.  Ms. Connor resides in a nursing facility located in  . \n69.  Ms. Connor is a mother to two adult children, including a \ndevelopmentally disabled son. Ms. Connor acted as her son’s primary caregiver \nuntil she was no longer able due to her disabilities.  \n70.  Before her disability, Ms. Connor worked as a nursing assistant in a \nnursing facility before earning a college degree in chemical dependence with a \nconcentration in drug and alcohol counseling. Ms. Connor worked as a drug and \nalcohol counselor until she became too disabled to work in 2013 due to muscular \ndystrophy. \n71.  While Ms. Connor’s disabilities prevent her from working, she has \ncontinued to serve nursing facility residents and use her education and experience \nas a volunteer. In 2014, Ms. Connor began volunteering to assist nursing facility \nresidents to return to the community. In 2015, Ms. Connor began volunteering with \nan organization which assists nursing facility residents to return to the community.  \n72.  Born and raised in  , Ms. Connor thrived on community \nand family life prior to entering the nursing facility. She attended church, the \nmovies, and events at her local community center, such as comedy shows. Ms. \nConnor spent time with family at gatherings large and small.  \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 23 of 50\n73.  Ms. Connor entered the nursing facility on January 4, 2023, for \nrehabilitation following a fall in her apartment. Ms. Connor hopes to discharge \nfrom the nursing facility into a subsidized apartment.  \n74.  Defendant MDH last conducted an annual survey at the nursing \nfacility on August 8, 2022.  \n75.  Ms. Connor is unable to meet her own basic care needs due to her \ndisability and mobility impairment. She is incontinent of bladder and bowel. She \nrelies upon facility staff to transfer her into and out of bed, to assist her with \ntracheostomy care, to assist her to reposition in bed to prevent pressure ulcers and \nmaintain skin integrity, as outlined in her Plan of Care.  \n76.  The nursing facility often fails to meet Ms. Connor’s documented care \nneeds, increasing her risk of developing pressure ulcers, complications related to \nher ventilator and tracheostomy, and falls.  \n77.  Ms. Connor has waited hours for the facility to provide her with \nincontinence care. When facility staff do not change Ms. Connor’s incontinence \nbriefs, she experiences a loss of dignity and humiliation. She has at times been \nprovided with a fresh incontinence brief placed over the soiled one. \n78.  Due to her mobility impairment, Ms. Connor relies on the facility to \nrespond to a call bell to assist her with transferring out of her bed into a \nwheelchair, attending to her incontinence and respiratory needs, and other daily \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 24 of 50\ncare tasks. Ms. Connor often waits from thirty minutes to two hours for staff to \nrespond to her call bell. For the past several months, the facility has failed to keep \nMs. Connor’s call bell in working order.  \n79.  The nursing facility is often without hot water. On or around \nSeptember 26, 2023, Ms. Connor filed a complaint with MDH after the facility \nfailed to provide hot water, because all personal care or cleaning of the \nenvironment was being done with cold water.  \n80.  MDH has not yet investigated Ms. Connor’s September 26, 2023, \ncomplaint, and the facility’s problems maintaining adequate hot water continue.  \nMichael Nevin \n81.  Mr. Nevin is a sixty-one-year-old Black man who is diagnosed with \nquadriplegia following a cerebral infarction, epilepsy, diabetes, anxiety disorder, \nmajor depressive disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, generalized muscular \nweakness, rosacea, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, high blood pressure, and \ncataracts, among other conditions.  \n82.  Mr. Nevin was admitted to the nursing facility located in   \n, on December 14, 2012. He has resided there ever since.  \n83.  MDH last conducted an annual survey of the facility on November 20, \n2020. \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 25 of 50\n84.  Before entering the nursing facility, Mr. Nevin worked as a journalist \nand in technology. He attended his church and enjoyed visiting with loved ones \nwhile participating in family gatherings.  \n85.  Mr. Nevin struggles to maintain his social network and relationships \nwhile living in the facility due to a lack of privacy for verbal and video \nconversations, and due to the facility’s failure to provide Mr. Nevin with the \nsupport he needs to attend events in the community.  \n86.  The nursing facility similarly fails to provide Mr. Nevin the support \nhe needs to create new social relationships. The nursing facility does not provide \nstaff to assist Mr. Nevin to go to common areas of the facility to interact with other \nresidents.  \n87.  Mr. Nevin is unable to meet his own basic care needs due to his \ndisability and mobility impairment. Mr. Nevin relies on the facility to assist him \nwith bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, medication management, repositioning in \nbed, transitioning into and out of bed, and for general mobility, as outlined in his \nPlan of Care.  \n88.  Mr. Nevin has been unnecessarily secluded in his room, away from \neveryone other than his roommate, against his wishes and without medical \njustification. For more than a year, the facility has failed to provide him with the \ntransition and mobility assistance required by his Plan of Care. It has failed to \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 26 of 50\nprovide him with a wheelchair so that he can transition out of his bed and engage \nwith other residents or leave the facility. It has denied his requests for using the \nfacility’s Geri-chair to leave his room.  \n89.  As a result, he has been confined to his bed in his shared room in the \nnursing facility since March 2023, with the exception of some medical \nappointments.  \n90.  The nursing facility’s failure to provide Mr. Nevin with transfer and \nmobility assistance has kept him from important family events and meaningful \ncommunity activities. For example, Mr. Nevin was recently honored by a leading \nlong-term care advocacy organization with its Leadership Award for his advocacy \non behalf of his fellow nursing facility residents. Mr. Nevin secured transportation \nto take him to the award ceremony, but he was unable to attend because the facility \ndid not provide him with a wheelchair. \n91.  The nursing facility assigned Mr. Nevin a roommate with apparent \ncognitive disorder who was physically aggressive with other residents. Because of \nhis disability, Mr. Nevin is unable to defend himself against any assault and was \ntraumatized by having an aggressive roommate in his room. \n92.  While missing out on social and community events and relationships \ndue to the facility’s failure to provide him with transfer and mobility assistance, \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 27 of 50\nMr. Nevin is confined to his bed, unable to leave the facility to breathe fresh air \nand feel sunlight. \n93.  Mr. Nevin is considered at risk for falling, and he has experienced \nseveral falls at the nursing facility.  \n94.  Due to his immobility and to reduce his fall risk, Mr. Nevin’s Plan of \nCare requires that staff anticipate his care needs and respond promptly to his \nrequests for assistance, including incontinence care, and that his call bell be kept \nreachable and in working order.  \n95.  The nursing facility frequently fails to provide “prompt response to all \nrequests for assistance,” including incontinence care. Mr. Nevin often goes an \nentire eight (8) hour shift or longer without incontinence care.  \n96.  At any given time, particularly during night shifts and on weekends, a \nsingle staff member is often responsible for the care of many residents. Mr. Nevin \noften waits an hour or more for a response to his call bell during these shifts.  \n97.  Mr. Nevin filed a complaint with MDH on April 30, 2024, regarding \nlack of notice as to roommate changes and failure to accommodate his technology-\ndependent communication needs, specifically the lack of privacy required by that \nmeans of communication. He also noted the prolonged denial of sunlight he has \nexperienced because the privacy curtain is continuously closed across the window \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 28 of 50\nin his room and he cannot independently adjust it. Mr. Nevin’s complaint has not \nyet been investigated. \n98.  Based on his experience, Mr. Nevin is very afraid that if he were to \nhave another stroke or medical emergency, staff would not respond to his call bell \nin time to provide him with life-sustaining care.  \nAlex Noonan \n99.  Mr. Noonan is an eight-five year old Navy veteran who is diagnosed \nwith Parkinson’s disease, anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, \nclaustrophobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, a spine condition, mild cognitive \nimpairment, osteoporosis, vision impairment, and muscle wasting/atrophy, among \nother conditions.  \n100.  Before his retirement, Mr. Noonan worked for a municipal finance \ndepartment for 35 years. A lifelong athlete, Mr. Noonan loved to run cross-country \nand exercise. Even into his 80s, Mr. Noonan maintained a strict daily regimen of \npushups and calisthenics to maintain his strength and physical conditioning.  \n101.  Following a surgery in 2020, Mr. Noonan was admitted for \nrehabilitation to the nursing facility in  . He has resided there \nsince March 21, 2020.  \n102.  Defendant MDH last conducted an annual survey at the nursing \nfacility on June 30, 2021. \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 29 of 50\n103.  Mr. Noonan is unable to meet his own basic care needs due to his \ndisability and mobility impairment. He relies upon the nursing facility to help him \ntransfer into and out of bed; reposition in bed to prevent pressure ulcers and \nprovide him with incontinence care at least every two hours (as he cannot walk to \nthe toilet), to maintain his skin integrity and prevent infection; and assist him with \nmobility, personal hygiene, support for socialization, nutrition, and medication \nadministration, as outlined in his Plan of Care.  \n104.  Mr. Noonan is unable to walk on his own. He uses a wheelchair and \nrelies on staff to navigate the wheelchair.  \n105.  Mr. Noonan is reliant on the facility to safely transfer into and out of \nbed. According to his Plan of Care, two staff are required to use a mechanical lift \nin order to safely transfer him into and out of bed.  \n106.  Mr. Noonan has frequently been told by nursing facility staff that \nthere was insufficient staff available to help him transfer out of his bed and into the \ncommon areas of the facility. Many days, Mr. Noonan does not leave his bed at all. \nHe rarely leaves his room. When Mr. Noonan is transferred out of bed, the nursing \nfacility often fails to provide two staff to transfer him, instead subjecting him to a \none-person transfer.  \n107.  Because Mr. Noonan rarely leaves his bed and even more rarely \nleaves his room, Mr. Noonan is seldom able to breathe fresh air and feel sunlight. \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 30 of 50\n108.  Mr. Noonan is unnecessarily secluded in his room when staff fail to \ntransfer him out of his bed. \n109.  Mr. Noonan’s personal hygiene and appearance are very important to \nhim, especially his hair, which he keeps long. Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care requires \nthat he be “clean, well-groomed and appropriately dressed daily with staff \nassistance.” However, the nursing facility often fails to provide Mr. Noonan with \nthis required care. \n110.  Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care requires staff to offer him a shower no \nfewer than twice per week. Despite this requirement, Mr. Noonan reports that he \nwants to be showered twice a week, but he is not regularly showered.  \n111.  Because Mr. Noonan is not showered regularly, he is not able to \nmaintain his personal hygiene and hair cleanliness as he prefers.  \n112.  Mr. Noonan currently has multiple pressure ulcers and has a history of \nfungal skin infections and developing pressure ulcers. \n113.  Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care requires that staff assist him to reposition \nin bed at least every two hours to prevent the development of pressure ulcers. He \nrequires the assistance of two facility staff to be safely repositioned.  \n114.  The facility often fails to reposition Mr. Noonan in bed every two \nhours as required by his Plan of Care.  \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 31 of 50\n115.  Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care requires that staff provide him with \nincontinence care, including application of a barrier cream, at least every two hours \nto prevent the development of pressure ulcers.  \n116.  The nursing facility often fails to provide Mr. Noonan with required \nincontinence care, leaving him on at least one occasion in incontinence briefs \nsoiled with urine and feces for more than twelve hours. \n117.  In addition to the risk of developing pressure ulcers, Mr. Noonan \nexperiences psychosocial harm, emotional distress, and a loss of dignity due to \nhaving been left in soiled clothing and linens.  \n118.  Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care requires that his call bell be kept within \nreach at all times. However, when Mr. Noonan uses the call bell to request \nassistance, he often waits more than an hour for help.  \n119.  Mr. Noonan believes that the facility does not have enough staff to \nrespond promptly to his call bell, so he limits himself to using his call bell only \nonce or twice per day when he requires incontinence care.  \n120.  Mr. Noonan’s Plan of Care recognizes that he should be evaluated for \nphysical therapy to help treat his Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Noonan has not been \nevaluated for or received any physical therapy to treat his Parkinson’s disease, \ncontractures, and other conditions related to his immobility.  \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 32 of 50\nHerman Dressel \n121.  Mr. Dressel is a fifty-seven-year-old white man who is diagnosed with \nleft-side weakness due to a stroke, ambulatory dysfunction, hand contracture, \ndiabetes, deep vein thrombosis, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, chronic \nkidney disease, dizziness, sleep apnea, obesity, generalized anxiety disorder, and \ninsomnia.  \n122.  Before his disability, Mr. Dressel worked in sales for a paper goods \ncompany. His real passions, though, were community service and sports. Mr. \nDressel was an active member of his church and a local fraternal organization, \nwhere he led youth activities. Throughout the 1990’s, Mr. Dressel served as the \nvolunteer chairman of the local recreation department’s soccer and baseball \nleagues. Mr. Dressel was a fixture of his local recreational sports leagues, \nparticipating in the same bowling league for 25 years.  \n123.  On November 30, 2021, Mr. Dressel was admitted to the nursing \nfacility located in   following a hospitalization for kidney failure. \nHe has resided in the facility ever since.  \n124.  Defendant MDH last conducted an annual survey at the nursing \nfacility on November 15, 2022.  \n125.  Mr. Dressel is unable to meet his own basic care needs due to his \nmedical conditions and mobility impairments. His Plan of Care requires staff to \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 33 of 50\nassist him with bathing, dressing, transferring into and out of bed, mobility, \npersonal hygiene, and medication management.  \n126.  Mr. Dressel’s Plan of Care requires that he get out of bed every day \nwith the assistance of two staff and a mechanical lift. Mr. Dressel often does not \nreceive the assistance that he needs to transfer safely into and out of bed. Two to \nthree times a month he is left in his bed for the entire day.  \n127.  On those occasions when Mr. Dressel is left in his bed for the day, he \nis unnecessarily secluded in his room when staff fail to transfer him out of his bed.  \n128.  Mr. Dressel has a history of falls. On March 2, 2023, Mr. Dressel was \ninjured when the nursing facility attempted an inappropriate one-person transfer \nusing a mechanical lift, contrary to his Plan of Care. During the botched lift, Mr. \nDressel struck his head and experienced dizziness and nausea. His injuries were so \nsignificant that Mr. Dressel was sent to the hospital for treatment, where he was \nadmitted.  \n129.  MDH has not yet investigated the circumstances which led to Mr. \nDressel’s March 2, 2023, injuries. \n130.  On or about May, 2023, Mr. Dressel’s wife filed a complaint on his \nbehalf with MDH concerning the poor care that Mr. Dressel was receiving at the \nfacility. The complaint alleged that on April 16, 2023, Mr. Dressel did not receive \nincontinence care for more than 15 hours, and that facility staff did not timely \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 34 of 50\nrespond to Mr. Dressel’s call bell. The complaint further alleged several additional \ninstances where facility staff did not respond to his call bell for prolonged periods \nof time, and that Mr. Dressel did not have access to the hoyer lift he needs to \ntransfer out of bed. \n131.  MDH has not yet investigated the May 2023 complaint.   \n132.  According to Mr. Dressel’s Plan of Care, he must receive specialized \nincontinence care and repositioning to reduce his risk of developing pressure \nulcers. Mr. Dressel often goes entire shifts or longer without incontinence care.  \n133.  On a regular basis, Mr. Dressel often waits 30 minutes to an hour for a \nresponse to a call bell, and often, when facility staff arrive, they ask what he needs \nand say they will come back, but they never do. \n134.  When Mr. Dressel requests facility staff assistance to change his \nincontinence brief, he is frequently told that if staff assist him into his bed for the \nchange, he will have to remain in bed for the rest of the day. Because he does not \nwant to be stuck in bed for the day, he now puts a towel inside his brief to capture \nurine during the day and avoid the need to change the brief. This means that he \nmust tolerate the urine-soaked towel all day instead. \n135.  Mr. Dressel is scheduled for a shower twice a week, on Mondays and \nThursdays. Despite the fact that Mr. Dressel’s Plan of Care requires staff assistance \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 35 of 50\nwith showering, facility records show that the facility often fails to shower Mr. \nDressel twice a week.  \n136.  Despite the fact that Mr. Dressel’s Plan of Care requires staff \nassistance with personal hygiene, the facility does not ensure that staff regularly \nassist him to brush his teeth, despite the contractures in his hands and weakness in \nhis arms. Facility staff have told him that they do not have time to assist him with \ndental care. As a result, his dental health has deteriorated significantly. \n137.  Mr. Dressel has requested, but not received, therapy to increase \nmuscle strength so that he can be more independent, for many months. His muscle \nstrength has continued to deteriorate.  \nRichard Hollman \n138.  Mr. Hollman is a fifty-seven-year-old white man who experienced a \ndevastating traumatic brain injury during a boating accident in 2002. As a result of \nhis brain injuries, Mr. Hollman is diagnosed as living in a “persistent vegetative \nstate” and experiences seizures. He is non-verbal and unable to communicate his \nwants and needs. Mr. Hollman is incontinent of bladder and bowel. He uses a \nurinary condom catheter.  \n139.  Eleanor Hollman, Mr. Hollman’s mother, is his legal guardian. \n140.  Mr. Hollman has resided at the nursing facility since 2003.  \n141.  MDH last conducted an annual survey at the facility in October 2022.  \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 36 of 50\n142.  Before becoming disabled, Mr. Hollman lived for boating and time in \nthe sun and on the water. Mr. Hollman performed maintenance and repairs on his \nboat and his two jet skis. Mr. Hollman was in his second year of studying to \nbecome a marine electrician at the time of the accident.  \n143.  When Mr. Hollman was not spending time on the water, he enjoyed \nwatching NASCAR races, football, and baseball, his beloved Chevrolet, and \ncollecting Budweiser beer memorabilia.  \n144.  Due to his disabilities, Mr. Hollman relies on the facility to anticipate \nand meet all of his care needs, including mobility, transfers into and out of bed, \nincontinence and catheter care, personal hygiene, socialization, mental stimulation, \nnutrition, and medication administration, as outlined in his Plan of Care.  \n145.  Mr. Hollman is unable to walk. He is reliant upon the nursing facility \nto help him move from place to place using a wheelchair. He is unable to support \nhimself while sitting in the wheelchair and relies on staff to use straps to secure \nhim in place.  \n146.  Mr. Hollman has a history of pressure ulcers.  \n147.  Mr. Hollman’s Plan of Care requires that specific care be provided to \nprevent new pressure ulcers from developing: that he be repositioned in bed at least \nevery two hours (other than during overnight hours), that he receives incontinence \ncare every two hours, that he receives daily skin checks by qualified staff, that he \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 37 of 50\nreceives weekly skin checks by a nurse, and that nursing staff employ pressure \nrelieving devices on his bed and wheelchair.  \n148.  Mr. Hollman’s records indicate that the nursing facility often fails to \nensure that he receives this required care, placing him at greater risk of developing \npressure ulcers.  \n149.  Most recently, in January 2024, Mr. Hollman developed a new stage 2 \npressure ulcer.  \nf.  MDH’s Administration of Facility Oversight Discriminates Against \nResidents with Mobility Impairments. \n150.  MDH abdicates its duty to ensure that Plaintiffs’ rights are honored in \nnursing facilities when it fails to conduct the survey and complaint investigations.  \n151.  MDH’s failure to timely investigate complaints is a chronic and well-\ndocumented problem. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office \nof Inspector General found that Maryland was one of only ten (10) states that \nfailed to meet CMS performance “timeliness threshold” requirements for nursing \nfacility complaint investigations each year from 2011 through 2018.  \n152.  The pattern of failed oversight has continued in the most recent CMS \nreport on state agency performance. See Center for Clinical Standards and Quality, \nCMS, Admin Info: 23-10-ALL: Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) State Performance \nStandards System (SPSS) Findings 7 (July 20, 2023). CMS found that MDH did \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 38 of 50\nnot meet four of the five measures relating to effective nursing facility survey and \ncomplaint process administration. Id. \n153.  In 2018, the Maryland Legislature enacted legislation to mandate \nincreased staffing in the MDH unit responsible for surveys and complaints, the \nOffice of Health Care Quality (OHCQ). In doing so, the Legislature cited “[t]he \nlack of commitment to investigating complaints regarding nursing homes and other \nfacilities by the State [which] is evident in the longstanding understaffing of nurse \nsurveyors in the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality,” and stated that “[t]here \nappears to be no commitment to change the deficient and dangerous conditions in \nterms of the timeliness of investigating nursing home complaints, which affects the \nhealth and well-being of vulnerable Marylanders who reside in nursing homes.” \nMaryland Nursing Home Resident Protection Act of 2018, S.B. 386, 2018 Reg. \nSess. (Md. 2018).  \n154.  In response to the legislation, MDH instituted a “7-Year Staffing \nPlan” beginning in fiscal year 2018, under which the Long Term Care Unit would \nreceive twenty (20) new, full-time surveyor positions between fiscal years 2020 \nand 2024. Office of Health Care Quality, Maryland Department of Health, \nAnalysis of the FY 2024 Maryland Executive Budget, 2023, at 14 [hereinafter FY \n2024 Md. Exec. Budget]. Despite MDH’s “7-Year Staffing Plan,” the nursing \nfacility survey unit has been understaffed, with many nursing facilities not \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 39 of 50\nsurveyed. See id. at 15; Office of Health Care Quality, Maryland Department of \nHealth, Analysis of the FY 2025 Maryland Executive Budget, 2024, at 5 \n[hereinafter FY 2025 Md. Exec. Budget]. \n155.  In fiscal year 2023, state legislative reports estimated that MDH \nretained an unspent $3.2 million, which had been budgeted for unfilled surveyor \nposition salaries and benefits. FY 2024 Md. Exec. Budget at 8. \n156.  Over the years, MDH has exacerbated the backlog in annual surveys, \ncomplaint investigations, and related enforcement activities by permitting \nsurveyors to transfer out of the Long Term Care Unit without replacement, and not \nrequesting the full funding from the Legislature needed to fully staff the Long \nTerm Care Unit so that all annual surveys are completed each year and all \ncomplaints are timely investigated. See id. at 14-15. \n157.  Further reducing its ability to timely conduct annual surveys and \ncomplaint investigations, MDH canceled its memorandum of understanding with \nMontgomery County Commission on Aging on or about March 2021, eliminating \n10 county-based surveyors who operated under the agreement, and replacing them \nwith only 4 state nursing facility surveyors. See Chitra Kalyandurg & Kaitlyn \nSimmons, Office of Legislative Oversight, Nursing Homes in Montgomery \nCounty: Regulatory Framework and Issues Impacting the Quality of Care 82, 98 \n(July 25, 2023); Letter from Barbara Seller, Montgomery County Commission on \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 40 of 50\nAging, to Dr. Patricia Tomsko Nay, Executive Director, Office of Health Care \nQuality 1 (Mar. 29, 2021). \n158.  According to the most recent publicly available data, the Long-Term \nCare Unit remains significantly understaffed. See FY 2025 Md. Exec. Budget at 5. \nVI.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n159.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \n160.  Plaintiffs seek certification of a class of similarly situated individuals \nwho are: \nResidents of nursing facilities, who have disabilities with mobility \nimpairment, and who live in nursing facilities that operate under the \noversight authority of MDH. \n161.  The class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. \nAccording to CMS data, there are at least 9,056 people with mobility impairment \nresiding in nursing facilities in Maryland. See CMS, Minimum Data Set \nFrequency, Q1 2024, Data.CMS.gov, https://data.cms.gov/quality-of-\ncare/minimum-data-set-frequency/data (last visited May 13, 2024); see also supra \nat Paragraph 50 and accompanying text. The questions of law and fact are common \nto and typical of those of members of the putative class they seek to represent. \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 41 of 50\n162.  The Plaintiffs and the putative class members rely on Defendants for \noversight and enforcement of their federal and state rights relating to the provision \nof nursing facility services.  \n163.  Defendants’ long-standing and well-documented failure to conduct \nannual surveys and timely complaint investigations departs from their state and \nfederally mandated duties and violates the legal rights of Plaintiffs and the putative \nclass members they seek to represent.  \n164.  Questions of fact common to the class include:  \na.  Does MDH substantially deny the plaintiff class enforcement of \ntheir resident rights and quality of life standards under state and federal law by \nfailing to conduct annual surveys of nursing facilities? \nb.  Does MDH substantially deny the plaintiff class their resident \nrights and quality of life standards under state and federal law by failing to timely \ninvestigate complaints in nursing facilities?   \nc.  Does MDH’s failure to conduct timely annual surveys and \ninvestigations of complaints have a disparate impact on the plaintiff class of \nnursing facility residents with mobility impairments? \n165.  Questions of law common to the class include:  \na.  Does Defendants’ administration of MDH’s nursing facility \noversight and corrective enforcement program violate the ADA’s requirement that \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 42 of 50\n“[a] public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, \nutilize criteria or methods of administration . . . [t]hat have the purpose or effect of \ndefeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public \nentity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities”? 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 \n(b)(3)(ii). \nb.  Does Defendants’ administration of MDH’s program of \noversight and enforcement of nursing facilities fail to protect Plaintiffs’ right to \nparticipate in social, religious, and community activities that do not interfere with \nthe rights of other residents in the facility?  \nc.  Does Defendants’ administration of MDH’s program of \noversight and enforcement fail to protect Plaintiffs’ rights and ensure compliance \nwith quality of care standards under the NHRA?  \nd.  Does Defendants’ administration of MDH’s program of \noversight and enforcement fail to protect Plaintiffs’ rights and ensure compliance \nwith quality of care standards under the Maryland Resident Bill of Rights Act, Md. \nCode Ann., Health – Gen., § 19-343? \n166.  The violations of law and resulting types of harm and risks of harm \nalleged by Plaintiffs are typical of the legal violations and types of harms and risks \nof harm experienced by all members of the proposed class. \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 43 of 50\n167.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass that they seek to represent. \n168.  There is no conflict between the interests of the Plaintiffs and the class \nthey seek to represent. \n169.  The Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys who are competent and \nexperienced in class action litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, nursing \nfacility law, and complex civil litigation.  \n170.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds applicable to the \nclass, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. \nVII.  LEGAL CLAIMS \nCount I \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. \n(Methods of Administration Violation) \n171.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs 1 \nthrough 170 above as if fully set forth herein.  \n172.  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with \ndisabilities: “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 44 of 50\n173.  Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning \nof the ADA due to their physical, mental, or cognitive disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § \n12131(2).  \n174.  The regulation implementing the ADA prohibits Defendants from \n“directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utiliz[ing] criteria or \nmethods of administration . . . [t]hat have the purpose or effect of defeating or \nsubstantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s \nprogram with respect to individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii).  \n175.  As residents of Medicaid-funded nursing facilities, Plaintiffs meet the \nessential eligibility requirements as qualified individuals with disabilities to receive \nand benefit from the oversight and corrective enforcement activities and programs \nof MDH. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n176.  Defendants are a public entity under the ADA, charged under federal \nand state law with protecting the health and safety of Maryland’s nursing facility \nresidents.  \n177.  As a result of MDH’s conduct, Plaintiffs are denied meaningful access \nto and the benefit of MDH’s nursing facility oversight and enforcement activities. \nDefendants’ methods of administration of its oversight and enforcement duties \nhave the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with mobility-\n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 45 of 50\nrelated disabilities, and thereby subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of \ndisability. Such methods of administration include the failure to conduct annual \nsurveys and the failure to timely investigate many complaints. Taken together or \nseparately, these failures defeat or substantially impair the purpose of MDH’s \noversight program, i.e., to protect the rights of nursing facility residents and to \nensure that nursing facility residents receive quality care. \nCount II \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n(Methods of Administration Violation) \n178.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs 1 \nthrough 170 above as if fully set forth herein.  \n179.  Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n180.  As residents of nursing facilities subject to Defendants’ oversight, \nPlaintiffs are otherwise qualified to receive and benefit from the oversight and \ncorrective enforcement activities and programs of MDH. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n181.  Defendants are recipients of federal financial assistance subject to the \nrequirements of Section 504. Id. \n182.  The regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nprohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from “utiliz[ing] criteria or \nmethods of administration (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 46 of 50\nhandicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, [or] (ii) that have \nthe purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the recipient’s program or activity with respect to handicapped \npersons.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4)(i), (ii).  \n183.  As a result of MDH’s conduct, Plaintiffs are denied meaningful access \nto and the benefit of MDH’s nursing facility oversight and enforcement activities. \nDefendants’ methods of administration of its oversight and enforcement duties \nhave the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the \nobjectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with mobility-\nrelated disabilities, and thereby subject Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of \ndisability. Such methods of administration include the failure to conduct annual \nsurveys and the failure to timely investigate many complaints. Taken together or \nseparately, these failures defeat or substantially impair the purpose of MDH’s \noversight program, i.e., to protect the rights of nursing facility residents and to \nensure that nursing facility residents receive quality care. \nRELIEF SOUGHT \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the Plaintiff Class, request that the \nCourt: \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this action and maintain continuing \njurisdiction until the Defendants are in full compliance with the order of this Court; \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-ABA   Document 1   Filed 05/15/24   Page 47 of 50\nb.

ECF 36. Plaintiffs have also filed a motion to \ncertify the class. ECF 32. The motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition. No hearing is \nnecessary. See Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023). For reasons explained below, Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss shall be denied, and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class certification shall be granted.  \n   \n \n1 Plaintiffs filed a motion to seal the unredacted version of their Complaint and to proceed on the public \nrecord by pseudonym. ECF 2. Plaintiffs argued that the facts of this case involve sensitive personal medical \ninformation regarding each Plaintiff and voiced concerns of potential retaliation. ECF 2-1. Defendants filed \na response in opposition to the motion, ECF 24, but then withdrew their opposition to give the parties an \nopportunity to negotiate a protective order, ECF 25. The Court has granted the motion. ECF 57.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 2 of 34\nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn  May  15,  2024,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Class  Action  Complaint  against  the  Maryland \nDepartment of Health (“MDH”)  and MDH’s Secretary Laura Herrera  Scott, in her official \ncapacity. ECF 1. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) for alleged failures \nto conduct statutorily mandated annual surveys and investigate complaints within statutorily \nprescribed time frames. Id. ¶ 2. On July 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification \nseeking certification of a class consisting of “[r]esidents of nursing facilities who have disabilities \nwith mobility impairment, and who live in nursing facilities that operate under the oversight \nauthority of the Maryland Department of Health.” ECF 32, 32-1. On July 22, 2024, Defendants \nfiled a Motion to Dismiss, ECF 36, and a response in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification, ECF 42. Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, \nECF 45, and a reply to Defendants’ response in opposition to the Motion for Class Certification, \nECF 50. Defendants filed a reply in support of their Motion to Dismiss. ECF 52. Finally, the Court \ngranted leave for attorney Toby S. Edelson to file a brief of amicus curiae in support of Plaintiffs’ \nopposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. ECF 59, 60. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nMDH is the designated state survey agency for the State of Maryland responsible for \ncertifying nursing facilities in Maryland to receive funding through participation in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs and is responsible for specific oversight and enforcement functions \nimposed by the Nursing Home Reform Act (“NHRA”). 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); 42 C.F.R. § 488.11. \nSpecifically, MDH is required to conduct an annual survey of each Medicaid- and Medicare-\nparticipating nursing facility to certify compliance with federal standards for staffing, safety, and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 3 of 34\nquality of care, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(g)(1)(A), (g)(1)(C), (g)(4); 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1); and \ninvestigate complaints of resident neglect and abuse and noncompliance with federal standards, \n42 C.F.R. §§ 488.332, 488.335. The survey process uses “resident and patient outcomes” to \nestablish compliance and specifically involves “directly observ[ing] the actual provision of care \nand services to residents and/or patients, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care \nprovided meets the needs of individual residents and/or patients.” 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(2). State \nlaw also requires MDH to make site visits and to conduct annual unannounced surveys of nursing \nfacilities and promptly investigate complaints of harm to residents. Md. Code Ann., Health–Gen. \n§ 19-1408(a), (b). MDH must make “information respecting all surveys and certifications made \nrespecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies,” available to the public. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396r(g)(5)(A)(i). Each state is required to establish certain remedies for noncompliance \nwith federal standards for quality of care and protection and promotion of resident rights and to \ntake remedial action when deficiencies are found. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h). Remedies \ninclude termination or denial of federal funds, fines, appointment of outside management, state \nmonitoring, a directed plan of correction, transfer of residents, and closure of the facility. See id.; \n42 C.F.R. § 488.406; Md. Code Ann., Health–Gen. § 19-1402(a). \nPlaintiffs and members of the putative class are mobility-impaired residents of Medicaid- \nand Medicare-participating nursing facilities in  Maryland. ECF 1 (“Compl.”), ¶¶ 1, 14–18. \nPlaintiffs allege that MDH fails to complete annual surveys of these nursing facilities and \ninvestigate residents’ complaints of nursing facility residents within mandated time frames. Id. ¶¶ \n4–6. “MDH’s performance in timely completing annual surveys is among the worst” in the \ncountry, and “[m]any serious complaints alleging harm go uninvestigated for months or years . . . \n.” Id. ¶¶ 4–6, 59. Specifically, MDH had not completed an annual survey in 181 of Maryland’s \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 4 of 34\n225 Medicaid- and Medicare-participating nursing facilities in the 16 months before the Complaint \nwas filed, id. ¶ 54, and more than 100 nursing facilities had not been surveyed in four years, id. ¶ \n56. The lack of MDH oversight has unique impacts on Plaintiffs due to their heightened need for \ncare by, and increased reliance upon, nursing facility staff, which stem from their mobility \nimpairments. Id. ¶ 7. Plaintiffs rely on nursing staff assistance for hygiene and incontinence care, \nsocialization, receipt of pain medication, and even, in some instances, to eat and drink water, which \nmakes them uniquely vulnerable to performance failures and staffing shortages at their facilities. \nId. ¶¶ 7–8. Plaintiffs allege that nursing facilities in Maryland have a record of poor performance \n“over numerous review cycles[,]”particularly in Black communities, and MDH’s failure to detect \nand address violations as required under the NHRA results in “unique and unaddressed harm” to \nPlaintiffs “due to the nature of their disability.” Id. ¶¶ 9–10.  \nThe Complaint details each Plaintiff’s experience at a nursing facility in Maryland and \nreliance on facility staff for basic needs, including being transferred in and out of bed, regular \nrepositioning in bed and incontinence care, personal hygiene, nutrition, medication management, \nmovement to common areas, attendance of community events. Id. ¶¶ 67–149. Deficiencies in the \nquality of care and protection of resident rights at these facilities have caused, and placed Plaintiffs \nat  risk  of,  pressure  ulcers,  skin  infections,  falls,  psychosocial  harm,  and  other  medical \ncomplications. Id. Some Plaintiffs have been confined to their beds or their rooms for months. Id. \n¶¶ 89, 92, 106, 107. At the time the Complaint was filed in May 2024, the most recent statutorily \nmandated survey that had been conducted at any of these facilities was in November 2022. Id. ¶ \n123. A survey had not been completed at one facility since November 2020. Id. ¶ 83. Plaintiffs \nallege that if MDH complied with its obligations by conducting annual surveys and timely \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 5 of 34\ninvestigating complaints, it would discover violations and be required to take corrective action. Id. \n¶ 66.   \nIII.  MOTION TO DISMISS \nDefendants request that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint for lack of jurisdiction \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, alternatively, for failure to \nstate a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The Court addresses both purported grounds for dismissal, \nin turn.   \nA.  Standing \n1.  Standard of Review \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \nRule 12(b)(1). See Barnett v. United States, 193 F. Supp. 3d 515, 518 (D. Md. 2016). “The plaintiff \nbears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, the existence of subject matter \njurisdiction.” Mayor & City Council of Balt. v. Trump, 416 F. Supp. 3d 452, 479 (D. Md. 2019).  \n“A challenge to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may proceed in one of two \nways: either a facial challenge . . . or a factual challenge.” Id. (citations omitted) (internal \nquotations omitted). A facial challenge asserts “that the allegations pleaded in the complaint are \ninsufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.” Id. A defendant’s facial challenge “will be \nevaluated in accordance with the procedural protections afforded under Rule 12(b)(6), which is to \nsay that the facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true . . . .” In re Jones v. Md. Dept. of \nPub. Safety, No. 1:21-cv-01889-JRR, 2024 WL 493269, at *3 (D. Md. Feb. 8, 2024). \n2.  Discussion \nDefendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the Complaint fails to allege \nsufficient facts to confer Plaintiffs’ standing to bring suit. ECF 36-1 at 8–12. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 6 of 34\nArticle III of the United States Constitution extends judicial power to the courts to decide \nactual cases and controversies. Spokeo v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 337 (2016). The requirement of \nArticle III standing ensures that the federal courts do not extend their power beyond actual cases \nand controversies. Id. at 338 (citations omitted). The “‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of \nstanding consists of three elements.” Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n560 (1992)). To have standing, “[t]he plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is \nfairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by \na favorable judicial decision.” Id. (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). “At least one plaintiff must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim and form of requested relief.” Kenny v. Wilson, 885 F.3d 280, \n287 (4th Cir. 2018) (citing Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 439 (2017)). \nThe plaintiff “bears the burden of establishing these elements.” Id. (citing FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, \n493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990)). At the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly allege facts in support \nof each element. Id. (citation omitted).  \na.  Injury in Fact \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that they have been deprived of “meaningful access to and the benefit \nof MDH’s nursing facility oversight and enforcement activities[,]” which are prescribed by federal \nand state law to detect noncompliance with applicable safety and quality standards and violations \nof Plaintiffs’ rights as nursing facility residents. Plaintiffs further allege that, given their mobility \nimpairments, they have suffered unique risks and harms at nursing facilities in Maryland resulting \nfrom violations that MDH has failed to detect due to its uniquely deficient performance in \nconducting annual surveys of nursing facilities and timely investigations of resident complaints.  \nThere is no dispute that the physical, social, and emotional harms and risks alleged in the \nComplaint are sufficiently “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent” to satisfy the “injury \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 7 of 34\nin fact” requirement for standing. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021). \nDefendants argue, however, that the alleged denial of MDH’s oversight and enforcement functions \nis not “concrete” and is “entirely abstract . . . .” ECF 52-2 at 6. The Court disagrees.  \nWhile it is well established that a “concrete” injury must be “real” and “not ‘abstract[,]’” \n“‘[c]oncrete’ is not . . . necessarily synonymous with ‘tangible.’” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the “important role[]” that “the judgment of Congress” plays \n“[i]n determining whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact[.]” Id. Indeed, “Congress \nis well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements,” and \nit “may ‘elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were \npreviously inadequate in law.’” Id. at 341 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578). Although “a bare \nprocedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm,” is inadequate to constitute an injury in \nfact, id., a procedural violation may constitute an injury in fact if “the procedures in question are \ndesigned to protect some threatened concrete interest of [the plaintiff’s] that is the ultimate basis \nof his standing[,]” Hodges v. Abraham, 300 F.3d 432, 444 (4th Cir. 2002) (quoting Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 573 n.8); see also Murphy by Murphy v. Minnesota Dep’t of Hum. Servs., 260 F. Supp. 3d \n1084, 1100–01 (D. Minn. 2017)).  \nIt is clear that the procedural requirements of the NHRA are designed to protect and \npromote a wide range of rights possessed by residents of nursing facilities and to assure quality of \nservices provided in nursing facilities. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396r. Here, Plaintiffs allege \nsufficient facts to show that the “concrete interest” they have in the rights and quality of services \nprotected by the NHRA has been injured and remains under threat by MDH’s failure to satisfy its \noversight and enforcement obligations under the statute and its implementing regulations. The \ninjury created by MDH’s procedural failures is connected to a variety of concrete physical, social, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 8 of 34\nand emotional harms and risks identified in the Complaint for each of the named Plaintiffs. See \nCompl. ¶¶ 67–149. According to these allegations, each Plaintiff has been affected “in a personal \nand individual way.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1. Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim to injury based on MDH’s \nfailure to meet its oversight and enforcement obligations respecting nursing facilities in Maryland \nis sufficiently concrete and particularized to state an injury in fact for purposes of standing. \nb.  Causation and Redressability \nAs noted above, to confer standing, an injury in fact must be “fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendant” and “likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” \nSpokeo, 578 U.S. at 338 (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61). Causation and redressability “are often \n‘flip sides of the same coin.’” Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, \n380–81 (2024) (quoting Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 288 \n(2008)). “If a defendant’s action causes an injury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for \nthe action will typically redress that injury.” Id. at 381. “The ‘fairly traceable’ requirement ensures \nthat there is a genuine nexus between a plaintiff’s injury and a defendant’s alleged illegal conduct.” \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 161 (4th Cir. 2000). \nHowever, the burden imposed by the “fairly traceable” standard is “relatively modest” at the \nmotion-to-dismiss stage, DiCocco v. Garland, 52 F.4th 588, 592 (4th Cir. 2022) (quoting Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 171 (1997)), and is “not equivalent to a requirement of tort causation[,]” \nFriends of the Earth, 204 F.3d at 161 (citation omitted). Standing does not require the plaintiff to \n“show that a particular defendant is the only cause of their injury[.]” Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. \nv. Watkins, 954 F.2d 974, 980 (4th Cir. 1992).  \nIn cases where government regulations “require or forbid some action by the plaintiff[,]” \nstanding to sue the regulating entity “is usually easy to establish.” All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 9 of 34\nU.S. at 382. “By contrast, when (as here) a plaintiff challenges the government’s ‘unlawful \nregulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else,’ ‘standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \nsubstantially more difficult to establish.’” Id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). “When the plaintiff \nis an unregulated party, causation ‘ordinarily hinge[s] on the response of the regulated (or \nregulable) third party to the government action or inaction—and perhaps on the response of others \nas well.’” Id. at 383 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). In such a case, the plaintiff “cannot rely on \nspeculation about the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts[,]” but, \ninstead, “must show that the third parties will likely react in predictable ways that in turn will \nlikely injure the plaintiffs.” Id. (cleaned up, citations omitted). “[T]he causation inquiry can be \nheavily fact-dependent and a ‘question of degree,’” and, therefore, “[d]etermining causation in \ncases involving suits by unregulated parties against the government is admittedly not a ‘mechanical \nexercise.’” Id. at 384 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court “has identified a variety of familiar \ncircumstances where government regulation of a third-party individual or business may be likely \nto cause injury in fact to an unregulated plaintiff.” Id. Several examples identified in Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine include “when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business” \nand “the regulation (or lack thereof) may cause downstream or upstream economic injuries to \nothers in the chain,” including customers. Id. at 384–85. \nAt this early stage of the litigation, the Court finds the facts alleged in the Complaint \nsufficient to draw a chain of causation between MDH’s oversight and enforcement failures and \nPlaintiffs’ particularized and unique injuries and risks as mobility-impaired residents of nursing \nfacilities. The Complaint supports a reasonable inference that the nursing facilities where Plaintiffs \nreside have reacted to the lack of oversight and enforcement by MDH in ways that have caused \nthem harm and put them at risk of greater harm. Plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate that they stand \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 10 of 34\nto benefit from MDH’s oversight and enforcement functions and that the fulfillment of these \nfunctions would predictably prevent the harms and risks they have suffered in their nursing \nfacilities. The enforcement remedies available to MDH are far-reaching, including termination and \ndenial of federal funding, outside management or monitoring, transfer of residents, and even \nclosure of the facility. Compl. ¶ 39 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h)(2); 42 C.F.R. § 488.406; Md. \nCode Ann., Health–Gen. § 19-1402(a)). The threat of having federal funding terminated or being \nshut down supports a reasonable prediction that nursing facilities would respond to consistent \nannual surveys, timely investigations of complaints, and any corrective plans by MDH in ways \nthat would be put an end to Plaintiffs’ personal risks and harms. In this action, Plaintiffs seek an \ninjunction requiring Defendants to conduct annual surveys, investigate complaints in a timely \nmanner, and take related enforcement actions. \nPlaintiffs’  allegations  suffice  to  show  that  their  injuries  are  “fairly  traceable”  to \nDefendants’ deficient regulation of nursing facilities in Maryland and are “likely to be redressed” \nby the judicial decision they seek in this case. Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 337. The chain of causation is \nnot too attenuated or speculative. It is only the regulated nursing facilities themselves that stand \nbetween Plaintiffs and MDH, and, if the facts alleged in the Complaint are accepted as true, it is \nhard to imagine that MDH’s fulfillment of its oversight and enforcement obligations would not \nbring Plaintiffs relief from their alleged personal injuries. \nIn sum, at this early stage of the case, the Court finds the Complaint sufficient to satisfy \nthe requirements of standing. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1) shall be denied. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 11 of 34\nB.  Failure to State a Claim \n1.  Standard of Review \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may file a \nmotion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. To \nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead enough factual allegations “to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). A complaint need not include “detailed factual \nallegations,” but it must set forth “enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest” a cognizable \ncause of action, “even if . . . [the] actual proof of those facts is improbable and . . . a recovery is \nvery remote and unlikely.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555–56 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nFederal pleading rules “do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the \nlegal theory supporting the claim asserted.” Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (per \ncuriam). However, “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief \nrequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction’s elements will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (cleaned up).  \nWhen considering a motion to dismiss, a court must take the factual allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. King v. Rubenstein, \n825 F.3d 206, 212 (4th Cir. 2016). At the same time, “a court is not required to accept legal \nconclusions drawn from the facts.” Retfalvi v. United States, 930 F.3d 600, 605 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). A court may consider documents “explicitly \nincorporated into the complaint by reference,” “those attached to the complaint as exhibits,” and \n“document[s] submitted by the movant that [were] not attached to or expressly incorporated in a \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 12 of 34\ncomplaint, so long as [they were] integral to the complaint and there is no dispute about [their] \nauthenticity.” Goines v. Valley Cmty. Servs. Bd., 822 F.3d 159, 165–66 (4th Cir. 2016) (citations \nomitted). “A document is integral to the complaint if its very existence, and not the mere \ninformation it contains, gives rise to the legal rights asserted.” Faulkenberry v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., \n670 F. Supp. 3d 234, 249 (D. Md. 2023) (cleaned up). \n2.  Discussion \nCounts I and II of the Complaint each assert a methods-of-administration violation, under \nthe ADA and Section 504 of the RA, respectively. ECF 1.  \na.  Legal Background \nClaims brought under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA “can be combined \nfor analytical purposes because the analysis is substantially the same.” Wicomico Nursing Home \nv. Padilla, 910 F.3d 739, 750 (4th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). ADA Title II provides that “[n]o \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded  from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. To prevail on a claim of \ndiscrimination under ADA Title II, a plaintiff must show that she: (1) has a disability or is regarded \nas having a disability; (2) is qualified to participate in or to receive the benefits of a public service, \nprogram, or activity; and (3) was denied such participation or benefits, “or otherwise discriminated \nagainst,” based on her disability. Nat’l Fed’n of the Blind v. Lamone, 813 F.3d 494, 502–03 (4th \nCir. 2016); see also Fauconier v. Clarke, 966 F.3d 265, 276 (4th Cir. 2020). To establish a \ndisability, a plaintiff must show “(1) that he has a physical or mental impairment, (2) that this \nimpairment implicates at least one major life activity, and (3) that the limitation is substantial.” \nHeiko v. Colombo Sav. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 254 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing 42 U.S.C. § \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 13 of 34\n12102(2)(A)). Section 504 of the RA provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nADA Title II and RA Section 504 claims may be pursued on a theory of disparate impact. \nBrown v. DPSCS, 383 F. Supp. 3d 519, 551–52 (D. Md. 2019) (quoting A Helping Hand, LLC v. \nBalt.  Cnty.,  515  F.3d  356,  362  (4th  Cir.  2008)).  “Title  II  prohibits  not  only  intentional \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals, but also any policies or practices that have a disparate \nimpact on disabled individuals.” Smith-Berch, Inc. v. Baltimore Cnty., Md., 68 F. Supp. 2d 602, \n621 (D. Md. 1999). “A cause of action based upon disparate impact arises where facially neutral \nrules or policies are applied in a way that affects the protected class differently from other groups.” \nBryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard Cnty., Md., 911 F. Supp. 918, 939 (D. Md. 1996), aff’d, 124 \nF.3d 597 (4th Cir. 1997).  \nPublic  entities  are  forbidden  from  “‘utilizing  standards,  criteria,  or  methods  of \nadministration’ that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a \nrational basis.” Pathways Psychosocial v. Town of Leonardtown, MD, 133 F. Supp. 2d 772, 788 \n(D. Md. 2001) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(3)(A)). Specifically, public entities are prohibited by \nregulation from methods of administration that subject disabled individuals “to discrimination on \nthe basis of disability” or have the “purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the \naccomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i),(ii); see also State of Conn. Off. of Prot. & Advoc. for \nPersons with Disabilities v. Connecticut, 706 F. Supp. 2d 266, 277 (D. Conn. 2010); Timothy B. \nv. Kinsley, No. 1:22-CV-1046, 2024 WL 1350071, at *2 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 29, 2024) (“‘methods of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 14 of 34\nadministration’  regulation  prohibits  public  entities  from  utilizing  ‘criteria  or  methods  of \nadministration . . . [t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination.”) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i)). The regulation “applies to written policies \nas well as actual practices, and is intended to prohibit both blatantly exclusionary policies or \npractices as well as policies and practices that are neutral on their face, but deny individuals with \ndisabilities an effective opportunity to participate.” Dunn v. Dunn, 318 F.R.D. 652, 664 (M.D. Ala. \n2016), modified sub nom. Braggs v. Dunn, No. 2:14CV601-MHT, 2020 WL 2395987 (M.D. Ala. \nMay 12, 2020) (quoting Cota v. Maxwell–Jolly, 688 F. Supp. 2d 980, 995 (N.D. Cal. 2010)).  \nActionable methods of administration include omissions. Id. at 665. Congress designed the \nRA, the predecessor statute to the ADA, to address not only “invidious animus,” but also, more \ncommonly, “thoughtlessness and indifference—[ ] benign neglect.” Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. \n287, 295 (1985); see also Dunn, 318 F.R.D. at 665 (“Title II [of the ADA] imposes affirmative \nobligations on public entities and does not merely require them to refrain from intentionally \ndiscriminating against the disabled.”) (quoting Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, \n385 F.3d 901, 910 (6th Cir. 2004)). “The methods-of-administration regulation makes clear that a \nknow-nothing, do-nothing policy of non-administration is a privately actionable violation of the \nADA, at least when plaintiffs can show that it has the effect of discriminating.” Lewis v. Cain, No. \n3:15-CV-318, 2021 WL 1219988, at *50 (M.D. La. Mar. 31, 2021). \nb.  Analysis \nThe Complaint in this case states plausible methods-of-administration claims under the \nADA Title II and RA Section 504. First, Plaintiffs and members of the putative class are \nindividuals with disabilities—specifically, mobility impairments. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 75, 87, 103, 125, \n144; see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(g)(1)(i), (i)(1)(i) (defining “disability” to include “[a] physical \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 15 of 34\nor mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such \nindividual[,]” such as “[c]aring for oneself” and “walking”). Second, Plaintiffs and each member \nof the putative class, as residents of Maryland-based nursing facilities, are qualified to receive the \nbenefits of MDH’s oversight and enforcement activities as federal protections mandated by the \nNHRA. Compl. ¶¶ 24–25; see also Levy v. Mote, 104 F. Supp. 2d 538, 543 (D. Md. 2000) \n(“Although Title II of the ADA does not define the phrase ‘services, programs, or activities,’ courts \nhave held that the phrase ‘encompasses virtually everything that a public entity does.’”) (citation \nomitted); Joseph S. v. Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 303 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (finding that plaintiff \nnursing home residents “are part of the class for whose particular benefit the NHRA was enacted” \nand that the NHRA creates an enforceable federal right). The objectives of MDH’s oversight and \nenforcement responsibilities under the NHRA include ensuring that the care provided in nursing \nfacilities meets the residents’ needs, protecting residents from serious harm, and promoting \n“efficiency and quality within the health care delivery system.” Compl. ¶¶ 25–26. The issue is \nwhether Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that Defendants have utilized methods of administration that, \nin effect, defeat or impair the foregoing objectives and thereby deny Plaintiffs, as individuals with \ndisabilities, the benefits of MDH’s oversight and enforcement activities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii). The Court finds the Complaint to be sufficient to state such a claim.  \nAs explained in Part III.A.2.b supra, the facts alleged in the Complaint draw a causal chain \nfrom MDH’s failure to fulfill oversight and enforcement obligations imposed by the NHRA to \nspecific harms and risks suffered by Plaintiffs that are unique to nursing facility residents with \nmobility impairments. First, Plaintiffs allege MDH has generally failed to conduct statutorily \nrequired annual surveys of nursing facilities and timely investigations of complaints from nursing \nfacility  residents.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  they  are  harmed  by  MDH’s  “delayed  complaint \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 16 of 34\ninvestigations” that often result in findings of no violations “due only to difficulties locating \ndocuments, staff turnover, or the subsequent discharge or death of the resident.” Compl.  ¶ 60.  \nAdditionally, Maryland is one of only four states in the country that has failed to conduct annual \nsurveys in over 70% of its nursing facilities, and more 100 of its 225 Medicaid- and Medicare-\nparticipating nursing facilities went without a survey in the four years before Plaintiffs filed suit. \nPlaintiffs cite data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) showing that MDH \nhad not completed a statutorily required annual survey in 181 of Maryland’s 225 licensed nursing \nfacilities in the 16 months before the Complaint was filed. Id. ¶ 54. According to the Complaint, \neach of the nursing facilities where the named Plaintiffs reside went between 18 months and three-\nand-a-half years without a survey before the Complaint was filed.  \nNext, Plaintiffs allege specific harms and risks unique to mobility-impaired individuals that \nplausibly arise from noncompliance with quality standards and violations of their rights as nursing \nfacility residents. As mobility-impaired residents, Plaintiffs are particularly vulnerable to such \nviolations because they are uniquely reliant upon nursing facility staff for a range of basic needs, \nincluding personal hygiene, getting in and out of bed, repositioning in bed, incontinence care, \nmedication management, and socialization. The alleged violations have resulted in pressure ulcers, \nskin infections, falls, psychosocial harm, and other medical complications, and heightened risks of \nsuch harms.  \nThird, the facts in the Complaint support a reasonable inference that the foregoing risks \nand harms would not occur if it were not for MDH’s failure to conduct annual surveys and timely \ninvestigations of complaints as required under the NHRA. Plaintiffs plausibly allege that MDH \nwould discover and redress the violations if it complied with its statutory obligations to conduct \nannual surveys, promptly investigate complaints, and take enforcement action.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 17 of 34\nIn  sum,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  MDH’s  failure  to  satisfy  its  statutory  oversight  and \nenforcement duties has uniquely severe impacts on mobility-impaired nursing facility residents, \nimposing upon them higher levels of harm and special injuries not suffered by residents who do \nnot have mobility impairments. Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Defendants’ methods of \nadministering their oversight functions, whether by commission or omission, “have the . . . effect \nof defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s \nprogram with respect to individuals with disabilities[,]” in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii).  \nDefendants argue that MDH’s liability under ADA Title II and RA Section 504 for its \nlicensing  and  certification  activities  is  governed  by  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(6),  not  by  § \n35.130(b)(3). Section 35.130(b)(6) prohibits a public entity from “administer[ing] a licensing or \ncertification  program  in  a  manner  that  subjects  qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,” or “establish[ing] requirements for the programs or \nactivities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(6). Defendants point out that the \n“programs or activities” of licensees are not covered by this regulation, id., and argue that MDH \nis not liable under this regulation for the conduct of nursing facilities.  \nDefendants’ arguments are misplaced. First, the Court agrees that MDH’s licensing and \ncertification activities are governed by § 35.130(b)(6), but that does not mean that MDH’s \nresponsibility  for  oversight  of  nursing  facilities  is  not,  at  the  same  time,  governed  by  § \n35.130(b)(3). Defendants state no reason and cite no authority for the proposition that it cannot be \nliable under multiple regulations for acts and omissions in its oversight of nursing facilities that \nhave disparate impacts on persons with disabilities. This Court is persuaded that § 35.130(b)(3) \napplies to MDH’s oversight of nursing facilities in Maryland and forbids MDH from methods of \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 18 of 34\nadministering its oversight functions in ways that subject mobility-impaired residents to disparate \nharms and risks based on their disabilities. \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ claims do not seek to hold Defendants liable for any discriminatory \nactions of individual nursing facilities. Plaintiffs do not claim, for example, money damages for \nany personal injuries sustained by individual Plaintiffs or members of the proposed class. The \nclaims are asserted against Defendants for their own deficient performance of their oversight and \nenforcement functions, which is plausibly alleged to have disparate impacts on nursing facility \nresidents with mobility impairments. \n Other courts have rejected the same arguments Defendants present here. In Disability \nAdvocates, Inc. v. Paterson, for instance, plaintiff residents of adult care facilities brought ADA \nclaims against the State of New York and state agencies for administering its mental health service \nsystem “in a manner that results in thousands of individuals with mental illness living and receiving \nservices in allegedly segregated settings.” 598 F. Supp. 2d 289, 318 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). The district \ncourt rejected the defendants’ arguments that they could not be liable for the conduct of privately \noperated adult homes. Id. The plaintiff “d[id] not challenge the conduct of adult homes licensed \nand certified by the State; instead, it challenge[d] the manner in which [the State] administer[ed] \nNew York’s mental health service system.” Id. See also Price v. Shibinette, No. 21-CV-25-PB, \n2021 WL 5397864, at *9 (D.N.H. Nov. 18, 2021) (rejecting argument that plaintiffs’ integration \nmandate methods-of-administration claims fail “because they are premised on the actions and \nomissions of private actors . . . for which defendants cannot be held liable” where “the complaint \nplausibly alleges that defendants’ own actions or omissions are responsible for the service gaps” \nby “failing to monitor service gaps, and failing to respond to those gaps by changing their methods \nof administration”). Plaintiffs here, like those in Disability Advocates and Price, challenge MDH’s \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 19 of 34\nadministration of its oversight and enforcement functions and its disparate impact on nursing \nfacility residents with mobility impairments, and they seek injunctive relief against Defendants’ \nallegedly discriminatory practices. Unlike the plaintiffs in the cases relied upon by Defendants \nhere, Plaintiffs do not seek to hold Defendants liable for the conduct of third parties. \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged facts sufficient to state a methods-of-\nadministration claim against Defendants. Defendants’ motion to dismiss shall be denied.  \nIV.  MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \nPlaintiffs move to certify a class comprised of mobility-impaired residents of nursing \nfacilities in Maryland. For reasons stated infra, the court finds that class certification is warranted \nand shall grant the motion.  \nA.  Standard of Review  \nClass certification is governed by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nPlaintiffs seeking to certify a class must meet four requirements of Rule 23(a) and satisfy one of \nthe enumerated conditions of Rule 23(b). Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 423 \n(4th Cir. 2003). Under Rule 23(a), a class must (1) be so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable; (2) have questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) have class representatives \nwith claims or defenses that are typical of the claims and defenses of the class; and (4) have class \nrepresentatives that will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a).  “The  Rule’s  four  requirements—numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequate \nrepresentation—effectively limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named \nplaintiff’s claims.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011) (quoting General \nTelephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition to satisfying all four requirements under Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must also \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 20 of 34\nsatisfy one of the enumerated conditions under Rule 23(b). As relevant to this case, a class may be \ncertified under Rule 23(b)(2) if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief \nis appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nWhen determining whether to grant class certification, “the question is not whether the \nplaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether \nthe requirements of Rule 23 are met.” Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974). \nThe court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” before certifying a class. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350–51 (2011). “Frequently that ‘rigorous analysis’ will entail some overlap \nwith the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.” Id. at 351. Still, Rule 23 does not allow for \ncourts “to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.” Amgen Inc. v. Conn. \nRet. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 465–66 (2013) (citations omitted). The court must strictly \nconfine its analysis to whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification have been satisfied. \nId. at 466.  \nB.  Discussion \nTo be certified as a class under Rule 23, Plaintiffs must show that the class is numerous, \nthe injuries are common to all class members, the claims alleged are typical of all class members, \nand the class representatives and their attorneys can adequately represent the entire class. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a). Here, Plaintiffs propose a class of at least 9,000 mobility-impaired individuals \nresiding in 222 nursing facilities in Maryland. Defendants concede that Plaintiffs satisfy the \nnumerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1).  \nDefendants contest whether Plaintiffs satisfy the commonality, typicality, and adequacy of \nrepresentation requirements of Rule 23(a)(2), (3), and (4). The analyses of these requirements \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 21 of 34\n“tend to merge.” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13. Commonality and typicality “[b]oth serve as \nguideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class \naction is economical . . . .” Id. All three requirements tend to confirm that “the named plaintiff’s \nclaim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly \nand  adequately  protected  in  their  absence[,]  .  .  .  although  the  [adequacy-of-representation] \nrequirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.” \nId.  \n1.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). “A single common question will suffice[.]” Peters v. Aetna Inc., 2 F.4th 199, \n242 (4th Cir. 2021) (citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359). “Commonality requires the plaintiff to \ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the same injury.’” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349–\n50 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157). “This does not mean merely that they have all suffered a \nviolation of the same provision of law.” Id. at 350. The plaintiff’s and class members’ “claims \nmust depend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that it is capable of classwide \nresolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Id.  Although Rule 23(a)(2) “speaks \nin terms of common questions, ‘what matters to class certification . . . is . . . the capacity of a class-\nwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.’” Peters, \n2 F.4th at 242 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350).  \n“[T]he commonality requirement is not a high bar[.]” J.O.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 338 F.R.D. 33, 53–54 (D. Md. 2020) (quoting Minter v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 274 F.R.D. \n525, 533 (D. Md. 2011)). “Minor differences in the underlying facts of individual class members’ \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 22 of 34\ncases do not defeat a showing of commonality where there are common questions of law.” Id. at \n53 (quoting Hewlett v. Premier Salons Int’l, Inc., 185 F.R.D. 211, 216 (D. Md. 1997)). “[F]actual \ndifferences among class members’ cases will not preclude certification if the class members share \nthe same legal theory.” Jonathan R. v. Justice, 344 F.R.D. 294, 304 (S.D.W. Va. 2023) (citing \nBroussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, 155 F.3d 331, 344 (4th Cir. 1998)). \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims, on behalf of all members of the proposed class, \npresent  a  common  question  and  depend  upon a  common  contention  “capable  of  classwide \nresolution[.]” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. The common factual and legal question is whether \nMDH’s administration of its  oversight and enforcement obligations under the NHRA deny \nmobility-impaired residents of nursing homes in Maryland the benefit of a service, program, or \nactivity based on their disability, in violation of ADA Title II and RA Section 504. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12132 (“No qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public \nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“No otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”). The common answer Plaintiffs offer \nis that the class members are denied this benefit by deficiencies in MDH’s discharge of its \noversight and enforcement responsibilities and the disparate impacts these failures have on \nPlaintiffs as mobility-impaired nursing facility residents.  \nTo support this common contention, Plaintiffs offer a declaration from each Plaintiff and \nother members of the proposed class; the Declaration of Marie Boltz, Ph.D, RN, GNP-BC; and a \nnumber of publicly available reports and procedural and operational manuals. See ECF 32-3 \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 23 of 34\nthrough 32-27, 33-1 through 33-11, and 50-1. Plaintiffs cite CMS data showing that MDH had not \ncompleted an annual survey in 174 of Maryland’s 222 Medicaid- and Medicare-participating \nnursing facilities within the 16-month period preceding the filing of Plaintiffs’ motion.2 ECF 32-\n2 at 8–9. Maryland is one of only two states in which annual surveys had not been conducted at \nmore than half of its nursing facilities within the three-year period, and more than 40% of its \nnursing facilities within the four-year period, before Plaintiffs filed their motion. ECF 32-2 at 9. \nOnly 6,685 of 13,173 resident complaints and facility-reported incidents from nursing facilities \nwere investigated within the three fiscal years preceding Plaintiffs’ motion. Id. at 9; ECF 32-9. \nPlaintiffs aver that MDH’s failure to conduct timely annual surveys and complaint investigations \ncompromise the investigations “through loss of evidence, staff turnover, or the discharge or death \nof the complaining resident, and lead to violations remaining undiscovered and uncorrected, \nthereby harming residents.” ECF 32-2 at 9–10 (citing ECF 32-10, 32-11, and 32-12). CMS data \nalso  reflects  findings  of  numerous  specific  deficiencies  at  Maryland  nursing  facilities  that \nspecifically and uniquely impact mobility-impaired residents, including deficiencies in assistance \nwith personal hygiene, incontinence care, repositioning, transfers, prevention and management of \nskin breakdown, response to call lights, and care planning. ECF 50-1 (citing CMS deficiency count \nreports). \nDr. Boltz is a professor of nursing and licensed nursing home administrator and registered \nnurse with 39 years of experience of patient care in nursing facilities, specialized training in \ngeriatrics and chronic care, and experience serving as a federal monitor evaluating quality of care \nto nursing home residents and compliance with federal regulations. ECF 32-3, ¶¶ 2–8. She \n \n2 In a declaration submitted by Defendants, the deputy director of the Long-Term Care Unit in MDH’s \nOffice of Health Care Quality (“OHCQ”) attests that OHCQ conducted 65 annual surveys in the 15 months \nbefore Defendants’ opposition brief was filed. ECF 42-3, ¶ 4. Accepting this figure, more than two-thirds \nof Maryland’s 222 nursing facilities went without an annual survey in that 15-month period. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 24 of 34\ninterviewed Plaintiffs and reviewed records from nursing facilities related to each Plaintiff’s \nmedical treatment, health care needs, functional capabilities, and required level of support; reports \nof deficiencies from past surveys conducted by MDH at the nursing facilities; and other nursing \nfacility  records.  Id.  ¶¶  10–14.  Dr.  Boltz  found  that  each  Plaintiff  demonstrated  mobility \nimpairments and had suffered harms and risks “uniquely related to their mobility impairment” \narising from noncompliance with federal standards for nursing facilities, including social isolation, \nanxiety, depression, falls, skin breakdown, urinary tract infection, respiratory complications, and \nhumiliation. Id. ¶¶ 15–48, 54. Plaintiffs’ own declarations and the declarations of other mobility-\nimpaired nursing facility residents detail these harms and risks, as well as MDH’s failure to \nrespond to their complaints. ECF 32-17 through 32-27, and 33-1 through 33-11. Other problems \ndescribed in the residents’ declarations include failures by nursing facility staff to respond to call \nlights, deficient incontinence care, and various other deviations from residents’ plans of care. See \ngenerally id. Dr. Boltz notes, from her experience, that  “thorough and timely surveys and \ncomplaint investigations can identify violations so that corrective actions can be taken to protect \nresident rights and mitigate the risks of immobility, while supporting the protection of resident \nrights.” ECF 32-3, ¶ 53. Dr. Boltz concludes that MDH’s “failure to conduct timely and thorough \nannual  surveys  of  the  nursing  facilities  [reviewed  in  her  report]  and  to  conduct  timely \ninvestigations of the Plaintiffs’ complaints resulted in a lack of oversight and increased risk of \nharm for immobile residents.” Id. ¶ 55.  \nPlaintiffs’ contention that MDH’s deficient administration of its responsibilities under the \nNHRA relies upon a legal theory applicable to the entire proposed class: that MDH’s actions and \nomissions  violate  the  methods-of-administration  regulation,  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(b)(3).  This \nregulation prohibits public entities from using “methods of administration” that subject “qualified \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 25 of 34\nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability” or have the “purpose or \neffect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the public \nentity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i),(ii). \nPlaintiffs do not merely assert that they and the class members “suffered a violation of the same \nprovision of law.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. They assert that MDH violated the methods-of-\nadministration regulation in the same way: failing to conduct statutorily required annual surveys \nof Maryland nursing facilities and timely investigations of complaints arising from these facilities. \nPlaintiffs claim that MDH’s failures disparately subject the entire class of mobility-impaired \nnursing facility residents to a common set of harms and heightened risks. To redress the common \ndeprivation of MDH’s oversight, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring Defendants to conduct \nannual surveys on a twelve-month cycle, investigate complaints within the time frames prescribed \nby statute, and complete enforcement activities to ensure compliance with federal and state \nstandards. Compl. at 48–49. This relief would give Plaintiffs and all class members the benefit of \nMDH’s services, program, or activities Plaintiffs claim they are unlawfully denied in violation of \nADA Title II and RA Section 504. Ultimately, then, the common question Plaintiffs present in this \nlitigation is “capable of classwide resolution[.]” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish commonality because the circumstances \nof each Plaintiff and member of the proposed class are “highly individualized,” including “real \ninjuries” in some instances and only “an increased risk of harm” in others. ECF 42-1 at 20–21. \nThis Court is not persuaded. While there is some variation among the specific personal harms and \nrisks of harm suffered by members of the proposed class, Plaintiffs do not challenge the individual \ninstances in which each class member suffered a personal harm or risk at a nursing facility. Further, \nthe relief Plaintiffs seek will not require individualized inquiry into the personal circumstances of \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 26 of 34\nindividual members of the proposed class. The injury Plaintiffs claim is common to the entire class \nis deprivation of MDH’s oversight and enforcement functions, and the injunctive relief they seek \ntargets that deprivation by requiring Defendants to conduct statutorily mandated oversight and \nenforcement activities. The declarations submitted by Plaintiffs reflect a range of personal harms \nand risks that, according to Dr. Boltz’s declaration, fall within the category of harms and risks that \nare unique to nursing facility residents with mobility impairments and are aggravated by MDH’s \nfailures in oversight and enforcement. See ECF 32-3, 32-17 through 32-27, and 33-1 through 33-\n11. In this litigation, Plaintiffs challenge MDH’s deficient oversight and enforcement activities, \nand the relief they seek would apply uniformly to benefit the entire class. See Thorn v. Jefferson-\nPilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 331 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing In re Monumental Life Ins. Co., 365 \nF.3d 408, 416 (5th Cir. 2004) (“Of course, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate only if \nmembers of the proposed class would benefit from the injunctive relief they request.”). Plaintiffs \nneed only identify one common contention based on a common legal theory capable of class-wide \nresolution to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). Having done that, what factual differences exist among \nmembers of the proposed class cannot defeat Plaintiffs’ showing of commonality. See Peters, 2 \nF.4th at 242 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). For these reasons, the Court rejects Defendants’ \nargument that variety among the class members’ personal circumstances and injuries defeats \ncommonality.3  \n \n3 As Plaintiffs point out, other courts in similar cases have rejected the same argument Defendants advance \nhere. See Kenneth R. ex rel. Tri-Cnty. CAP, Inc./GS v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254, 267 (D.N.H. 2013) \n(“Substantial evidence suggests that the State’s policies and practices have created a systemic deficiency in \nthe availability of community-based mental health services, and that that deficiency is the source of the \nharm alleged by all class members.”); B.D. by next friend Wellington v. Sununu, No. 21-CV-4-PB, 2024 \nWL 4227544, at *15 (D.N.H. Sept. 18, 2024) (rejecting defendants’ argument that plaintiff’s claims “turn \non highly individualized inquiries regarding the ‘legality of hundreds of [foster] placement decisions’ that \ndefeat commonality” where plaintiff “does not challenge any particular placement decision” or seek \nindividualized relief but, rather, “challenge specific acts and omissions in the defendants’ operation of its \nfoster care program that allegedly expose all class members to an ADA violation”). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 27 of 34\nDefendants argue that “a significant number of nursing facilities were surveyed in a timely \nmanner[,]” and this fact “by itself defeats the Plaintiffs’ claim for commonality.” ECF 42-1 at 19. \nDefendants’ only support for this fact is the statement of a MDH official that surveys were \nconducted at approximately 29% of Maryland’s nursing facilities in the 15-month period before \nDefendants’ filed their opposition brief. ECF 42-3, ¶ 4. The declaration, thus, confirms that, within \nthat 15-month period, more than two-thirds of Maryland’s nursing facilities lack what should have \nbeen an annual survey. Defendants fail to address, however, Plaintiffs’ data showing that, as a \ngeneral matter, surveys are not being conducted on an annual basis with any consistency and \ncomplaints from nursing facility residents are not being investigated within time frames prescribed \nby federal and state law. Plaintiffs point out that, although MDH had, in 2024, completed surveys \nat three specific nursing facilities identified in Defendants’ opposition and exhibits attached \nthereto, each of those “annual” surveys were the first conducted at the respective facility since \n2019. ECF 50 at 8 (citing CMS data). The Court finds the data Defendants offer in rebuttal \ninadequate to defeat Plaintiffs’ showing of commonality.  \nIn sum, the Court finds that commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied in this \ncase. \n2.  Typicality \nNext, the Court looks to whether the injuries suffered by the named Plaintiffs are typical \nof the injuries suffered by the class. Rule 23(a)(3) requires “claims or defenses of the representative \nparties” to be “typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “The essence \nof the typicality requirement is captured by the notion that ‘as goes the claim of the named plaintiff, \nso go the claims of the class.’” Deiter v. Microsoft Corp., 436 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir. 2006) \n(quoting Broussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 340 (4th Cir. 1998). The \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 28 of 34\ntypicality analysis requires the court to “compare the named plaintiff’s claims or defenses with \nthose of absent class members.” In re Marriott Int’l Inc., Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 341 \nF.R.D. 128, 148 (D. Md. 2022) (cleaned up). The court must determine “whether a sufficient \nrelationship exists between the injury to the named plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class, so \nthat the court may properly attribute a collective nature to the challenged conduct.” J.O.P., 338 \nF.R.D. at 55 (quoting Hewlett, 185 F.R.D. at 217). The named plaintiff’s claims “cannot be so \ndifferent from the claims of absent class members that their claims will not be advanced by \nplaintiff's proof of his own individual claim.” Deiter, 436 F.3d at 466–67. The named plaintiff’s \nclaims and those of other class members “need not be ‘perfectly identical or perfectly aligned[.]’” \nEaly v. Pinkerton Gov’t Servs., Inc., 514 F. App’x 299, 305 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Deiter, 436 \nF.3d at 467). A “claim may differ factually and still be ‘typical’ of the claims of class members if \nit arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other \nclass members[.]” J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 55 (quoting Bullock v. Bd. of Educ. of Montgomery Cnty., \n210 F.R.D. 556, 560 (D. Md. 2002)). The named plaintiff’s “pursuit of his own interests ‘must \nsimultaneously tend to advance the interests of the absent class members.’” Ealy, 514 F. App’x at \n305 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Deiter, 436 F.3d at 466). The typicality analysis “tends to merge with \nthe commonality and adequacy-of-representation requirements.” Deiter 436 F.3d at 466. \nHere, Plaintiffs have established a “sufficient relationship” between the injury they assert \nand conduct by Defendants that affect the proposed class as a whole, such that Plaintiffs’ claims \nare typical of those among class members. J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 55. Named plaintiffs Irene \nConnor, Michael Nevin, Alex Noonan, and Richard Hollman, and all proposed class members are \nmobility-impaired residents of nursing facilities in Maryland subject to oversight from MDH. \nGiven their mobility impairments, Plaintiffs and all class members share a “risk of common \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 29 of 34\ncomplications” that is created and aggravated by MDH’s failure to provide statutorily required \noversight of these nursing facilities and enforce standards imposed by state and federal law. ECF \n32-3, ¶¶ 48, 55. Based on her experience and an examination of the named Plaintiffs’ medical \nrecords, Dr. Boltz opines that that the harms and risks “experienced by Plaintiffs are typical of \nmobility impaired residents.” Id. ¶¶ 10, 54. Dr. Boltz’s conclusions are corroborated by the \nindividual declarations of each Plaintiff and other mobility-impaired residents of nursing facilities \nin Maryland, which reflect a common set of unique harms and risks associated with their mobility \nimpairments. ECF 32-17 through 32-27, and 33-1 through 33-11. These harms and risks relate to \nnoncompliance with federal standards that are likely to be identified and corrected by timely \nsurveys and complaint investigations by Defendants, which they have failed to provide. ECF 32-\n3, ¶ 53. Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims are connected with the same acts and omissions by Defendants \nthat “give[] rise to the claims of other class members[.]” J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 55. The named \nPlaintiffs and the members of the proposed class “are similarly situated legally and factually,” and \nPlaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that MDH “pursued the same course of conduct as to all \nclass members.” In re Marriott Int’l, 341 F.R.D. at 149. Plaintiffs’ “pursuit of [their] own interests” \nin this litigation “simultaneously tend[s] to advance the interests of” all members of the proposed \nclass. Ealy, 514 F. App’x at 305 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Deiter, 436 F.3d at 466). The injunction \nPlaintiffs seek here tends to advance the interests of all mobility-impaired residents of nursing \nfacilities in Maryland. \nDefendants argue that variations among the specific harms and risks sustained by each \nPlaintiff and class member individually Plaintiffs defeat typicality. ECF 42-1 at 23–24. This \nargument fails for the same reason it fails to rebut commonality. In this case, Plaintiffs claim a \ncommon injury based on MDH’s failure to exercise statutorily mandated oversight and seek relief \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 30 of 34\nin the form of an injunction requiring it to conduct the oversight it presently fails to provide. Each \nPlaintiff’s claim to this relief is typical for the entire class. What variety exists among the specific \nharms and risks suffered by Plaintiffs and the class members as individual residents of specific \nnursing facilities does not “strike[] at the heart” of the causes of action asserted in this case. Deiter, \n436 F.3d at 467. To support their argument, Defendants cite the Amchem case, an asbestos action \nwhere the plaintiffs sought money damages, which would require individualized assessment of \neach class member’s specific physical injuries. ECF 42-1 at 23–24 (citing Georgine v. Amchem \nProds., Inc., 83 F.3d 610 (3d Cir. 1996), aff’d sub nom. Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. \n591 (1997)). The instant case, in contrast, involves a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief \nthat will apply evenly to each Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class. The named \nPlaintiffs’ claims to this relief are, as noted above, typical of all class members’ claims.  \nIn sum, the Court finds that the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) is met in the instant \ncase.  \n3.  Adequacy of Representation \nThe Court next turns to whether the adequacy-of-representation requirement has been \nsatisfied. Rule 23(a)(4) requires a finding that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The adequacy requirement “serves to \nuncover conflicts of interest between the named parties and the class they seek to represent.” \nAmchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 625. To defeat adequacy of representation, a conflict of interest “must \nbe fundamental” and “go to the heart of the litigation.” Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 430–31 (cleaned up). \n“Representation is adequate if: (1) the named plaintiffs’ interests are not opposed to those of other \nclass members, and (2) the plaintiffs’ attorneys are qualified, experienced and able to conduct the \nlitigation.” J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 55 (citation omitted); see also In re Marriott Int’l, 341 F.R.D. at \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 31 of 34\n150 (court must “determine: (1) whether the named plaintiffs . . . have any conflicts of interest \nwith other class members; and (2) whether the named plaintiffs . . . will prosecute the action \nvigorously on behalf of the entire class”) (citation omitted). \nHere, first, Plaintiffs’ interests in this litigation “are not opposed” to the interests of the \nproposed class. To the contrary, as explained in Parts IV.B.1 and 2 supra, Plaintiffs’ interests are \naligned with those of the class members. The Court finds no “fundamental” conflict of interest \nbetween Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class, nor have Defendants identified any such \nconflict. Second, Plaintiffs’ attorneys are “qualified, experienced and able” to prosecute their ADA \nand RA claims on a class-wide basis. J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 55. Plaintiffs’ counsel include attorneys \nwith substantial experience with class actions and other forms of complex civil litigation, as well \nas expertise with issues related to access to health care and public benefit programs. Additionally, \neach Plaintiff or their guardian attests that she or he has been advised of their responsibilities as \nclass representatives and is prepared to satisfy those responsibilities. The Court is satisfied, and \nhas no reason to doubt, that Plaintiffs “will prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the entire \nclass.” In re Marriott Int’l, 341 F.R.D. at 150. Defendants’ arguments that the class members’ \ninjuries are too diverse for Plaintiffs to represent them adequately fail for the same reasons that \nargument fails to rebut commonality and typicality. See Parts IV.B.1 and 2 supra; Falcon, 457 \nU.S. at 158 n.13 (analyses of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation “tend to \nmerge”). Accordingly, the Court finds that the adequacy-of-representation requirement of Rule \n23(a)(4) is met in this case.  \n4.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nFinally, Plaintiffs bring this class action under Rule 23(b)(2). Plaintiffs claim that “the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 32 of 34\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nThe key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the injunctive \nor declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is \nsuch that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the \nclass members or as to none of them.” . . . In other words, Rule \n23(b)(2)  applies  only  when  a  single  injunction  or  declaratory \njudgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does \nnot authorize class certification when each individual class member \nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment \nagainst  the  defendant.  Similarly,  it  does  not  authorize  class \ncertification  when  each  class  member  would  be  entitled  to  an \nindividualized award of monetary damages. \n  \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360–61 (citation omitted). “‘[C]ivil rights cases against parties charged with \nunlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples’ of what (b)(2) is meant to capture.” Id. \nat 361 (quoting Amchem, 521 U.S. at 614).  \nHere, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ conduct violates Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the ADA and RA, as well as injunctive relief requiring Defendants to conduct annual \nsurveys of nursing facilities, investigate complaints in a timely and accurate manner, and make \navailable to the public information respecting all nursing facility surveys. Compl. at 47–49. The \ndeclaratory and injunctive forms of relief Plaintiffs seek would provide a remedy to all members \nof the class and are therefore “indivisible” in nature. Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360. There are no \nclaims for different injunctions or declaratory judgments for different members of the class, nor \nclaims for individualized awards of money damages. Thus, Defendants’ argument that the case \n“presents individual issues that destroy the necessary cohesiveness that Rule 23(b)(2) requires” \nhas no merit. ECF 42-1 at 25–26. See J.O.P., 338 F.R.D. at 57 (Rule 23(b)(2) satisfied where \nplaintiffs challenge policies that “apply generally to the class, and the requested relief . . . ‘would \nprovide the same relief to all class members’”) (citation omitted).  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 33 of 34\nDefendants next argue that “Rule 23(b)(2) is not met when the relief sought is simply to \ncomply with the law.” ECF 42-1 at 26 (citing Ginwright v. Exeter Fin. Corp., 280 F. Supp. 3d 674, \n690 (D. Md. 2017)). This argument is misplaced. The Court agrees that vague and overbroad \n“obey-the-law injunctions run afoul of the traditional equitable principle—codified in Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 65(d)—that an injunction ‘state its terms specifically[ ] and . . . describe in \nreasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or required.’” Bone v. Univ. of N. Carolina Health \nCare Sys., 678 F. Supp. 3d 660, 708 (M.D.N.C. 2023); see also Davison v. Loudoun Cnty. Bd. of \nSupervisors, 267 F. Supp. 3d 702, 722–23 (E.D. Va. 2017), aff’d sub nom. Davison v. Randall, \n912 F.3d 666 (4th Cir. 2019), as amended (Jan. 9, 2019) (“[I]njunctions that simply require their \nsubjects to follow the law are generally overbroad.”) (citation omitted). On this basis, courts have \nrejected “vague ‘obey the law’ provisions” in injunctions proposed by plaintiffs. Id. at 708–09; see \nalso Ginwright v. Exeter Fin. Corp., 280 F. Supp. 3d at 690 (“A claim for an injunction that simply \norders a defendant to comply with the TCPA and follow the law is not a proper for class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).”). The injunction Plaintiffs seek in the instant case does not \nsuffer from the vagueness and overbreadth that has invalidated “obey-the-law” injunctions in other \ncases. Here, Plaintiffs do not seek a vague and overbroad directive that Defendants comply with \nthe ADA, RA, or the methods-of-administration regulation. Instead, Plaintiffs seek a directive that \nDefendants to comply with particular requirements imposed by the NHRA and Maryland law to \nconduct annual surveys of nursing facilities in Maryland and timely investigations of complaints. \nThe injunction Plaintiffs request here is specific and tailored specifically to the discriminatory and \nunlawful conduct alleged in this case.  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that all Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) conditions for \nclass certification are met in this case. Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification shall be granted. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01423-MJM     Document 62     Filed 04/22/25     Page 34 of 34\nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify the Class \n(ECF 32) and deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF 36).  \nA separate Order will follow. \n   4/22/25             ________________________________ \nDate            Matthew J.
