    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit involves a First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment challenge to disciplinary policies at Shawnee State University.</p>\r\n<p>On November 5, 2018, a Shawnee State University philosophy professor sued the following entities and individuals at the University: the Trustees; the Interim President (also the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs); Acting Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences; Chair of the Department of English and Humanities; Title IX Coordinator; Deputy Title IX Coordinator; and Director of Human Resources and Deputy Title IX Coordinator.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged the following facts underlying his claims: In 2016, plaintiff received an email and had communications with defendants, which informed him that faculty could face disciplinary action if they refused to use a student&rsquo;s requested name or pronouns, per University policy. In 2018, the plaintiff declined to address a transgender student by their preferred pronouns and, when the student escalated the matter to the University, the University took disciplinary action against the plaintiff, pursuing a formal investigation and formal charges against him, as well as warning him of further disciplinary action if he continued to express his views. Plaintiff noted in his complaint that he (1) specifically took issue with the University&rsquo;s policies, outlined in their &ldquo;Non-Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reporting &amp; Investigating Sexual Assault, Sexual Misconduct &amp; Other Forms of Discrimination&rdquo;, which governed faculty expression, and sought to challenge facially and as-applied the University policies and (2) that the investigation conducted against him violated several provisions of his collective bargaining agreement with the University. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants&rsquo; actions violated his right to freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, and right to be free from unconstitutional conditions; constituted content and view-point discrimination; and constituted compelled speech &ndash; in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiff further alleged that defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by punishing him under vague and overbroad University policies. Plaintiff also raised non-federal claims, alleging violations of the Ohio Constitution&rsquo;s provisions for right of conscience and free exercise of religion, and breach of contract via violation of plaintiff&rsquo;s collective bargaining agreement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The matter was referred to Magistrate Judge Karen L. Litkovitz.</p>\r\n<p>An anonymous Jane Doe and the Sexuality and Gender Acceptance organization filed a motion to intervene as defendants on December 24, 2018. Jane Doe sought to intervene as the transgender student at the center of the lawsuit. The Sexuality and Gender Acceptance organization is a student-led organization at the University, dedicated to advocating for LGBT students. Both parties sought to intervene to help protect the policies and practices at the University for transgender students and gender expression, and both parties noted that they have substantial legal interests in the outcome of the case.</p>\r\n<p>On January 7, 2019, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiff had critically failed to state a claim. First, defendants argued that the individually-named members of the Board of Trustees and Department Chair at the University should be dismissed, as no specific allegations were made against them. Further, defendants argued that plaintiff&rsquo;s claims, on the merits, boiled down to (1) a First Amendment retaliation claim which misunderstood and mischaracterized the University&rsquo;s standard policies governing discrimination and harassment in the workplace, and (2) arguments raising Ohio law, such as the collective bargaining agreement, which the court should abstain from hearing given state sovereign immunity and avoidance of claims for novel extensions of Ohio constitutional law.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to seal, in order to shield the identity of Jane Doe and to redact references to her name on the original complaint. The court granted the motion to allow Jane Doe to proceed pseudonymously in the lawsuit and on February 5, 2019, the complaint was re-filed, amended to remove references to the identity of Jane Doe but otherwise remaining the same in substance and in legal claims.</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, 2019, the court issued its order, granting Jane Doe and the Sexuality and Gender Acceptance organization&rsquo;s motion to intervene as defendants. The court was persuaded that the University would not adequately represent the interests of the two parties as the University would likely emphasize different harms and legal interests, and therefore held it appropriate for the two to intervene to protect their private interests. Once the court issued that order, on May 10, 2019, Jane Doe and Sexuality and Gender Acceptance filed a separate motion to dismiss, arguing that the University&rsquo;s non-discrimination policies did not unconstitutionally limit University employees&rsquo; freedom to express views on any subject, as employers are entitled to insist that employees adhere to nondiscrimination policies in the course of their official duties.</p>\r\n<p>On September 5, 2019, Magistrate Judge Litkovitz issued a Report and Recommendations on all of the plaintiffs&rsquo; stated claims. With respect to the federal claims, the report recommended dismissing all claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The report held that the plaintiff&rsquo;s speech did not touch on a matter of &ldquo;public concern&rdquo; within the meaning of the First Amendment, as the speech was limited and occurred in the context of plaintiff&rsquo;s employment. With respect to the non-federal claims, the report recommended declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims. Defendants filed an objection to the report and recommendation, to which the defendants responded.</p>\r\n<p>On February 12, 2020, U.S. District Judge Susan J. Dlott court issued its order, adopting the Report and Recommendations of Magistrate Judge Litkovitz. Finding the rationale of the report persuasive, the court held it appropriate to adopt the report in full, overruling plaintiff&rsquo;s objections. The court therefore granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss, and dismissed the action.</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, 2020, defendants filed a notice to appeal the court&rsquo;s order adopting the Magistrate Judge&rsquo;s Report and Recommendations. On March 26, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued its decision, affirming the district court&rsquo;s due process holding, reversing the free speech and free exercise holdings, and vacating the state law holdings &ndash; and remanding the case for further proceedings, consistent with its findings. The U.S. Court of Appeals held that professors at public universities retain First Amendment protections when engaged in core academic functions, and as a result, it is inappropriate to conclude unilaterally that the government can censor teacher speech without restriction. Further, the Court of Appeals held that as the plaintiff had expressed a viewpoint on gender identity as part of a larger national debate on pronoun usage, the plaintiff&rsquo;s speech was about a matter of public concern and, if plaintiff&rsquo;s allegations are taken as true on their face, the University violated his free speech and exercise rights by impermissibly burdening his speech. However, the Court of Appeals was unpersuaded by the plaintiff&rsquo;s argument that the University&rsquo;s policies were unconstitutionally vague as applied to him: it held that the plaintiff was on notice that the policy prohibited his conduct.</p>\r\n<p>On May 18, 2021, the Court of Appeals granted leave to the Trevor Project, Inc.; the American Association of Suicidology, AMA; the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Association of Social Workers; and over 100 professors to file brief as amicus curiae, to support a petition for rehearing en blanc.</p>\r\n<p>While the specific details of the settlement negotiations and its final terms are not available to the Clearinghouse, the parties began to engage in settlement discussions to resolve the issues in the case without further judicial intervention. The parties eventually came to an agreement privately. On April 14, 2022, in accordance with that settlement agreement, the parties filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal with prejudice, and the case was terminated.</p>",

Introduction and Plaintiff’s factual allegations. \n  Plaintiff Nicholas Meriwether, a Professor at Shawnee State University, filed the present \nlawsuit after he received a “written warning” following an investigation and the finding that he \nwas treating a transgender student in his classroom in a discriminatory fashion.  Plaintiff also \nchallenges being directed to address that same transgender student using a female title (“Miss” or \n“Ms.”) and pronouns (“she/her”) or by not using such pronouns or titles to address any of the \nstudents in the class.  Meriwether objects to the latter directive in particular, citing his strongly-\nheld personal, philosophical and/or religious beliefs that the student was born biologically male, \nand contending the University’s investigation and directive lends “credence to cultural ideas Dr. \nMeriwether does not share or wish to advance.”  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 4.  Meriwether’s Complaint \nasserts  nine  (9)  overlapping  claims  for  relief  based  on  the  written  warning  (a  “University \ndisciplinary” action, Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 103) he received for his conduct towards a transgender \nstudent in his classroom, and his objections to the “cultural ideas” the directive represents.   \nMeriwether has been a professor, in various capacities, and member of the Shawnee State \nUniversity  faculty  since  1996.    Doc.  #1,  Comp.  ¶  91.    In  over  200  paragraphs  of  factual \nallegations, Meriwether recounts interactions over a period of two years that he had with his \nUnion and the University’s administrators on the issue of transgenderism.  He alleges that in \nAugust 2016, he was notified by his then-Union President of a U.S. Department of Education \n“Dear Colleague” letter on issues of transgenderism, and that his Union President informed \nfaculty members that they could face “disciplinary action from the University if they ‘refused to \nuse a [student’s] requested name or pronoun.’”  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 104-05.   \nBased upon this notice from his Union, Professor Meriwether alleges that he contacted \n1 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 10 of 38  PAGEID #: 560\n \nDr. Roberta Milliken, Dean of the University’s College of Arts & Sciences, on or around \nOctober 27, 2016, inquiring what University policies required of faculty on issues related to \ngender identity.  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 32, 107.  He alleges that Dean Milliken informed him at that \ntime  that  faculty  must  use  “a  student’s  preferred  pronoun”  when  addressing  the  student \n“regardless of the professor’s convictions or views on the subject.”  See id., ¶ 109.  On or around \nNovember 3, 2016, Professor Meriwether also addressed the issue with Department Chair for the \nUniversity’s Department of English and the Humanities, Dr. Jennifer Pauley.  See id., ¶¶ 36-37, \n114.1  During this meeting, Professor Meriwether alleges Dr. Pauley made negative statements \nregarding “Christian doctrines” and “exhibited hostility toward Dr. Meriwether and his religious \nbeliefs.”  See id., ¶¶ 115 – 119.   \nProfessor Meriwether states that, following a semester-long sabbatical, he returned to the \nUniversity in January 2018, and began teaching a class titled “Political Philosophy.” Doc. #1, \nComp. ¶ 122.  On January 9, 2018, during the first meeting of the class, Professor Meriwether \nanswered a student’s question, “Yes, sir” because he viewed the student as male.  See id., ¶¶ 124-\n25.  After class, the student approached Meriwether, and stated that the student was transgender, \nand asked to be addressed with “feminine titles and pronouns.”  See id., ¶ 133.  Professor \nMeriwether alleges that, when he told the student that “he was not sure students can dictate how \nprofessors must refer to them[.]”, the student uttered a profanity [c---], and circled Meriwether in \na belligerent and threatening fashion, and “promised” to attempt to have Meriwether, a Professor \n                                                 \n1 Although Dr. Pauley serves as “Department Chairperson”, under the collective bargaining \nagreement between the University and the Shawnee Education Association, Department Chairs \nare members of the bargaining unit.  Doc. #1, Exhibit 4, Art. 5, § 1.A.3, p. 11.  Consequently, as \nwill be discussed infra, the Department Chair is not an administrator of University policy, and \ncannot impose discipline or materially affect the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment \nany more that other faculty members under the University’s shared governance model.   \n2 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 11 of 38  PAGEID #: 561\n \nwith full tenure rights, fired if he did not “accede” to the student’s demands.  See id., ¶¶ 134–37.  \nProfessor Meriwether alleges that, after he notified the Dean of Students of this interaction with \nthe student, on January 11, 2018, Dean Milliken visited Meriwether’s office and asked him to \nbegin referring to his students by their last names only, and “to eliminate all gender references \nfrom his expression.”  See id., ¶¶ 146-47.  Meriwether alleges that he could not agree to this, but \ninstead proposed that he would continue to refer to his other students by “Mr.”, “Mrs.”, “Ms.” or \n“Miss”, but that he would refer to the objecting student by the student’s last name only, and that \nDean Milliken accepted this proposal.  See id., ¶¶ 126, 150-51.   \nMeriwether  alleges  that  this  arrangement  continued  for  about  two  weeks,  including \nmultiple classroom interactions with the student, but that on January 25, 2018, Dean Milliken \ncame to speak with Professor Meriwether and indicated that the student was unhappy with how \nProfessor Meriwether addressed the student in class and had indicated that student might file a \nTitle IX grievance.  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 153-54.  Meriwether further alleges that, on February 1, \n2018, he inadvertently referred to the student as “Mr.”, and then corrected himself.  See id.¸¶ \n157.   \nMeriwether alleges he was subsequently provided a letter from Dean Milliken, on or \naround February 13, 2018, outlining her position on the matter.  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 174, and letter \nattached as Ex. 9.  The letter stated that it was a formal notification and that if Meriwether did \nnot conform his conduct to the expectations of the University, it may lead to an investigation that \ncould result in formal disciplinary action.  See id.  An investigation was subsequently initiated.   \nSee id., ¶¶ 180-81.  Meriwether alleges that the initiation and conduct of the investigation \nviolated several provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, see id. ¶¶ 182 – 192, but he \ndoes not allege that he challenged any of those actions at that time, instead waiting until after the \n3 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 12 of 38  PAGEID #: 562\n \ninvestigation was completed.  The “Investigation Report”, attached to the Complaint as Exhibit \n13, indicates that Meriwether was interviewed on March 15, 2018.  Doc. #1, Ex. 13, p. 1.  The \n“Findings” of the report stated succinctly that, “Professor Meriwether has been reluctant to \naddress [the student] using she/her pronouns.  When called upon in class, [the student] is referred \nto as “[last name]” whereas all other students are addressed using formal Mr. Surname and Ms. \nSurname.  …  Professor  Meriwether  refuses  to  use  preferred  pronouns  when  addressing \ntransgender students.  He views this as a matter of academic freedom and truth that he intends to \nexercise.  Professor Meriwether on several occasions communicated that he does not recognize \ntransgenderism – he specifically stated that he believes transgender is a lie and mental illness and \nthat Professors should not have to change.”  See id., Ex. 13, pp. 3- 4.  Based on interviews with \nstudents, and the interview with Professor Meriwether, he was found to have been in violation of \nthe University’s non-discrimination/harassment policy.  See id., Ex. 13, p. 4.   \nOn April 18, 2018, Dean Milliken notified Professor Meriwether that based upon the \nfinding of disparate treatment of the student, a conference would be scheduled with him and his \nUnion representative.  See Doc. #1, ¶ 222, and Ex. 14.  Professor Meriwether was allowed to \nreschedule a meeting with the Dean (and his Union representative) from April 27, 2018, to May \n9, 2018.  See Doc. #1, Ex. 16, p. 1.  He subsequently received a report from the Dean on May 29, \n2018, summarizing the dates, investigation findings, and the Dean’s recommendations.  See id., \nEx. 17.  Professor Meriwether was then permitted to meet with the Provost.  See id., Ex. 18.  The \nProvost adopted the Dean’s recommendation for disciplinary action, and recommended that a \n“letter of warning” be placed in Professor Meriwether’s personnel file on June 14, 2018.  See id., \nExs. 19, 20.   \nOn or around June 22, 2018, a written warning was placed in Professor Meriwether’s \n4 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 13 of 38  PAGEID #: 563\n \npersonnel file, consistent with the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the \nUniversity.  See Doc. #1, Ex. 20.  Meriwether contacted his Union, and pursued a grievance \nunder the collective bargaining agreement.  See id., Ex. 22.  On or around August 16, 2018, \nMeriwether’s Union filed a formal challenge to the written warning with the University.  See id., \nEx. 23.  Meriwether and his Union Representative met with the Provost on August 22, 2018.  See \nid., Ex. 25.  The grievance was denied, and the decision to issue a written warning was upheld.  \nSee id.  A subsequent appeal to the University’s President was submitted, again consistent with \nthe collective bargaining agreement.  See id., Ex. 26.  Another grievance meeting was held, on or \naround  September  14,  2018,  including  the  attendance  of  Meriwether  and  his  Union \nRepresentative, and a designee for the President, Labor Relations Director David Zender.  See id.  \nIn affirming the imposition of a written warning, the President’s designee noted that the written \nwarning was not based on any inadvertent slip-up or single incident.  See id., Ex. 27, President’s \nGrievance Response dated Oct. 4, 2018.  The letter stated, “Notably, however, Meriwether \nacknowledged that he refused to stop singling out the student because of her gender identity after \nreceiving the notice of the policy’s requirements and options to accommodate his religious \nbeliefs…. Meriwether’s differential treatment of the student was a violation of SSU’s anti-\ndiscrimination policy.”  See id., Ex. 27, PAGEID # 337.  Although the Union had a right to take \nthe matter to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, no facts are alleged that the \nUnion has sought to take the matter to arbitration, and the time to seek an arbitration of the \ndispute has passed.   \nIn the present lawsuit, Meriwether seeks to challenge the imposition of a written warning, \nchallenging it under multiple, overlapping legal theories.  Meriwether’s Complaint also attaches \ntwo  Shawnee  State  University  policies  and  procedures  he  challenges:    (1)  the  “Non-\n5 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 14 of 38  PAGEID #: 564\n \nDiscrimination/Sexual  Harassment”  Policy,  5.01REV;  and  (2)  “Reporting  &  Investigating \nSexual Assault, Sexual Misconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination”, 5.01:2REV.  Doc. #1, \nComp. Exhs. 1 and 2.  He asserts similar, overlapping claims tied to his challenges to the written \nwarning he received.   \n  As will be discussed below, Meriwether’s Complaint fails to allege any viable claim of \nany deprivation of First Amendment (or any) constitutional rights, and fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted by failing to allege an adverse employment action, and his lawsuit \nshould be dismissed.   \nII.  Meriwether’s pleading burden and the standard of review.    \nIn assessing a complaint for failure to state a claim, the Court construes the complaint in \nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determines whether the complaint contains sufficient \nwell-pled  factual  allegations  to  state  a  claim  for  relief  that  is  plausible  on  its  face.    See \nDudenhoefer v. Fifth Third Bancorp, 692 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir. 2012), quoting Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)(internal citation and quotation omitted).  In standard Rule 12 \npractice, even though so-called “heightened pleading” is not required in § 1983 cases alleging \nthe deprivation of constitutional rights, see, e.g., Goad v. Mitchell, 297 F.3d 497 (6th Cir. 2002), \na court is not required to accept a plaintiff’s summary or conclusory allegations as true.  See \nLillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 726 (6th Cir. 1996).  The Court “need not \naccept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.”  Mixon v. Ohio, 193 F.3d \n389, 400 (6th Cir. 1999).  “A plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to \nrelief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \n“We do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim \n6 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 15 of 38  PAGEID #: 565\n \nto relief that is plausible on its face… [If] plaintiffs … have not nudged their claims across the \nline from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.”  Id.  As the Court later \nexplained in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.662, 678 (2009): \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  [quoting \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555].  A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff \npleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 556.  The plausibility \nstandard is not akin to a “probability requirement,” but it asks for more than a \nsheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.  Ibid.  Where a complaint \npleads facts that are “merely consistent with” a defendant's liability, it “stops short \nof the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”  Id., at \n557 (brackets omitted). \n \n… [T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a \ncomplaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements \nof a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.  Id. \nat 555.  \n \nAs will be discussed below, under this standard, the Court should dismiss all of Meriwether’s \nclaims against the named Defendants, and dismiss this lawsuit.   \nIII.  Law & Argument.  \n  Meriwether’s claims should be dismissed.  First, the individually-named members of the \nBoard of Trustees, and Department Chair Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed.  No specific \nallegations are made against the Board members, other than the conclusory allegations about \ntheir oversight role.  The Department Chair, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement \nbetween Professor Meriwether’s Union and the University, is a member of the Union, not an \nadministrator or supervisor who takes “disciplinary” action against Professor Meriwether or \notherwise “oversees” his duties as a University Professor.  On the merits, Meriwether’s claims \nbasically amount to a First Amendment retaliation claim, which is without merit based on, \namong other reasons, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 \n7 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 16 of 38  PAGEID #: 566\n \n(2006).  The “speech” he engaged in was actually nothing more than his own, personally defined \n“teaching method”, which is not speech on a matter of public concern based on long-standing \nprecedent in this Circuit.  Meriwether’s attempt to recast his workplace conduct as the free \nexercise of religion and attacks on Shawnee’s standard policies governing discrimination and \nharassment in the workplace on vagueness and overbreadth grounds simply misunderstands the \nlaw in this area, and should be dismissed.  Similarly, his arguments based on Ohio’s Constitution \nand the collective bargaining agreement are either not within this Court’s jurisdiction, or should \nbe dismissed for prudential reasons.   \nA.    The individually-named members of the Board of Trustees and Department \nChair Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed. \n \n  The claims against the individually-named Board of Trustees members, and Department \nChair  Jennifer  Pauley,  should  be  dismissed.    Plaintiff  asserts  no  fact,  allegation,  or  even \nsuspicion that any of the Board members were involved in any of the actions at the core of his \nconstitutional challenges.  Nowhere is there an allegation that any of the Board members had \nanything to do with, or in any way participated in the actions and events that Plaintiff challenges.  \nSimilarly, the Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that any Trustee is authorized to grant any relief \nhe seeks in the Prayer for Relief.  The Complaint only generally alleges that the Trustees have \n“final policymaking authority for rules and regulations that govern the University” and that the \nTrustees “have not modified the policies challenged herein.”  See Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 13 – 16.  In \naddition, the Complaint names two student Board members, Leen Heresh and Brett Rappold, \nwho under state law have no voting power on the Board.  See Ohio Rev. Code § 3362.01(B) \n(“The student members of the board of trustees of Shawnee State University have no voting \npower on the board.”)   \n  Other than naming the Board members as putative parties, Plaintiff asserts no allegations \n8 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 17 of 38  PAGEID #: 567\n \nagainst them.  Plaintiff does not allege any specific acts that the Board members had anything to \ndo with developing or instituting the policies he challenges, or that the Board members were \ninvolved in communicating with him or carrying out the discipline he challenges under the \nUniversity’s policies.  Having alleged no identifiable facts against the Board members at all, \nPlaintiff has failed to adequately plead a claim against them, and the Court must dismiss them as \nparties.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Lawsuits against state officials in their official capacities \nare the same as suits against the state itself.  See Will v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, \n71  (1989).    It  is  well  settled  in  the  Sixth  Circuit  that  Ohio’s  public  universities  are \ninstrumentalities of the state and, consequently, protected by the state’s Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity.  See, e.g., Hall v. Med. Coll. Of Ohio, 742 F.2d 299, 307 (6th Cir. 1984).  By naming \nthe Board members in their official capacity only, the state becomes the real party in interest by \nvirtue of the Board members’ positions because “a suit against a state official in his or her \nofficial capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official’s office.”  \nSee Will, 491 U.S. at 71.  These defendants should be dismissed. \n    In addition, Department Chair Dr. Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed.  The Complaint \nmakes the same conclusory allegations that Pauley “possesses the authority and responsibility for \ngoverning and regulating faculty in the Department of English and Humanities at the University” \nand  that  her  duties  include  “overseeing”  Professor  Meriwether.    However,  the  collective \nbargaining  agreement,  attached  as  Exhibit  4  to  the  Complaint,  states  that  the  position  of \n“Department Chairperson”, is a position in the faculty bargaining unit.  Doc. #1, Exhibit 4, Art. \n5, § 1.A.3, p. 11.  Consequently, the Department Chair is not an administrator of University \npolicy, and cannot impose discipline or materially affect the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s \nemployment  any  more  so  than  his  other  faculty  colleagues  can  under  academia’s  shared \n9 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 18 of 38  PAGEID #: 568\n \ngovernance system.  See, e.g., Doc. #1, Ex. 4, Coll. Barg. Agreement, Art. 18.   \nB.    Meriwether fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against \nany of the Defendants.   \n \n  Each of Meriwether’s claims fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nAlthough some of the claims, and controlling case law, overlap, they will be discussed below in \nthe order in which they are pled in Plaintiff’s Complaint.   \n1.  Meriwether’s “First Cause of Action” does not state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted because his refusal to use a \npronoun or title in addressing one student in his classroom was \nnot  “speech”  protected  by  the  First  Amendment,  and  the \nUniversity was within its rights to direct him on how to address \nthe  student,  and  he  did  not  suffer  an  adverse  employment \naction.   \n \nMeriwether’s allegations in his Complaint all relate to “speech” he made as an employee \nof  the  University,  during  a  University-offered  class,  and  was  not  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment.  In his first claim, Meriwether alleges that he has been punished for “expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity.”  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 282.  However, a plain reading of the \nComplaint indicates that the only interaction that is the subject of the University’s disciplinary \npolicy is Meriwether’s refusal to respect the “choice of titles and pronouns” with one student in \nthe context of a classroom.  See id., ¶ 283.  The simple, ministerial act of using a “title” and/or \n“pronoun” is not part of academic discourse but instead a simple act of respect.  As such, the act \nis simply part of Meriwether’s responsibilities as a Professor at the University, and not a forum \nfor him to express his personal beliefs.  In order for a public employee’s speech to warrant First \nAmendment protection (as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to state \nactors),  the  employee  must  show  that:    (1)  his  expressions  were  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was \nmotivated at least in part as a response to the exercise of his constitutional rights.  See Savage v. \n10 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 19 of 38  PAGEID #: 569\n \nGee, 665 F.3d 732, 738 (6th Cir. 2012), citing Fox v. Traverse City Area Pub. Schs. Bd. of Edn., \n605 F.3d 345, 348 (6th Cir. 2010).  Meriwether’s conduct, in refusing to use a title or pronoun as \nrequested by the student, is not “speech” protected by the First Amendment, and his claim fails \non that basis.   \nWhether a public employee’s speech is protected by the First Amendment is a question of \nlaw for the court.  See Fox, 605 F.3d at 350-51.  The lengthy factual allegations and attachments \nto  the  Complaint  give  the  Court  an  ample  record  to  resolve  this  legal  issue.    For  First \nAmendment protections to apply to a public employee’s speech, the employee’s speech must be \nmade “as a citizen” and address “a matter of public concern.”  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, \n146-47 (1983).  If the speech was made as a citizen and addresses a matter of public concern, the \npublic  employee  must  also  show  that  his  interest  in  speaking  outweighs  the  government’s \ninterest “as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through \nits employees.”  Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).  A government employee’s \nspeech is not protected, however, where it is made “pursuant to his duties.”  Garcetti v. Ceballos, \n547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006) (finding that a prosecutor’s speech in a memorandum challenging the \nprobable cause to support an affidavit was not protected by the First Amendment because it \nrelated to his official duties as a calendar deputy for the prosecutor’s office).  On this last point, \nMeriwether cannot satisfy the Garcetti requirement because this simple act of the use of titles \n(“Ms.” or “Miss”) and pronouns (“she/her”) relate to his position as a classroom instructor \naddressing  students  of  the  University  in  that  capacity  and  are  not  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment.  Meriwether’s “speech” involved one of the simplest, most ministerial acts possible \nfor a University professor – how to address a student in his classroom.  As a result, his speech \nwas directly related to his job, and is not protected by the First Amendment.   \n11 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 20 of 38  PAGEID #: 570\n \nThe Garcetti case established conclusively that the restrictions the Constitution places \nupon the government in its capacity as lawmaker and sovereign are not the same restrictions that \nit places upon the government as an employer.  In Garcetti, the Court held that when public \nemployees make statements related to their official duties, “the employees are not speaking as \n‘citizens’  for  First  Amendment  purposes,  and  the  Constitution  does  not  insulate  their \ncommunications from employer discipline.”  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421.  Garcetti and subsequent \ncases control Meriwether’s constitutional claims in this matter, and justify dismissal of his \nclaims.   \nThe Sixth Circuit has also recognized that teaching “methods” are not entitled to First \nAmendment protections in the way that academic arguments may or may not be protected.  See \nFrieder v. Morehead State Univ., 770 F.3d 428, 430 (6th Cir. 2014).  “[A] university may \nconstitutionally choose not to renew the contract of a nontenured professor whose pedagogical \nattitude and teaching methods do not conform to institutional standards.”  Parate v. Isibor, 868 \nF.2d 821, 827 (6th Cir. 1989).   \nIn Savage v. Gee, 665 F.3d 732 (6th Cir. 2012), plaintiff was the Head of Reference and \nLibrary Instruction at a public university, who also joined a committee formed to choose a book \nthat would be assigned to all incoming first year students at the university.  Savage, 665 F.3d at \n735.    Savage  served  on  the  committee  with,  among  others,  two  faculty  members  and  the \nuniversity’s Student Affairs Director.  See id.  A disagreement over which book to select resulted \nin a “discrimination/harassment” complaint being filed by a faculty member against Savage, to \nwhich Savage replied by filing his own “complaint of harassment” against multiple faculty \nmembers “for filing false complaints of sexual harassment against him.”  Savage, 665 F.3d at \n736.  The university investigated both complaints and found no basis for either.  See id.  Savage \n12 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 21 of 38  PAGEID #: 571\n \nalso filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging retaliation against him by virtue of his speech during \nhis membership on the committee “related to academic scholarship or classroom instruction.”  \nSavage, 665 F.3d at 738.  The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument, holding that his speech \nrelated to the committee was pursuant to his duties as Head of Reference and Library Instruction.  \nSee id. The Savage court noted that Savage did not disagree with the finding that his speech on \nthe  committee  related  to  his  official  duties,  but  instead  argued  that  his  speech  related  to \n“academic scholarship” or “classroom instruction” that is exempt from the Court’s holding in \nGarcetti.  The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument.  Since his speech was related to a workplace \nactivity, and his role as an instructor in the department was the reason for his presence and his \n“speech”, he had no claim that he was speaking as a “citizen” rather than as an employee.   \nMore broadly, Meriwether’s alleged “speech” does not relate to the rights of a public \nemployee to “participate in public affairs”, in the language of Connick v. Meyers, 461 U.S. 138, \n144-45 (1983).  The Garcetti Court recognized that public employees have a right to participate \nin the civic discourse as private citizens, and specifically pointed to the classic example of a \nletter to a newspaper by a school teacher in Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968), \n“whose  letter  to  the  newspaper  had  no  official  significance  and  bore  similarities  to  letters \nsubmitted by numerous citizens every day.”  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 422.  Public employees are \nprotected by the First Amendment in the same manner as other citizens – they can contribute to \nthe civic discourse as private citizens; “[t]his prospect of protection, however, does not invest \nthem with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.”  Id., 547 U.S. at 422.  Or, in the \nlanguage of Connick, “while the First Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, \nit does not empower them to ‘constitutionalize the employee grievance.’”  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at \n420, quoting Connick, 461 U.S. at 154.  Meriwether’s complaint instead relates to workplace \n13 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 22 of 38  PAGEID #: 572\n \ninteractions, which the University has not only the right, but a responsibility to manage under a \nplethora of workplace rules and regulations.   \nTo the extent that Meriwether claims his speech regarded his own personal concerns, \nneither does it satisfy the requirement that the speech be “on a matter of public concern.”  Speech \non matters of public concern “involves ‘issues about which information is needed or appropriate \nto enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the operation of their \ngovernment.’”  Brandenburg v. Housing Auth. of Irvine, 253 F.3d 891, 898 (6th Cir. 2001).  \n“[S]peech falling into this category includes informing the public that a governmental entity \nfailed to ‘discharge its governmental responsibilities’ or ‘bringing to light actual or potential \nwrongdoing or breach of public trust [on the part of a governmental entity or any officials \ntherein].’”  Rodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 596 (6th Cir. 2003), quoting Connick, 461 U.S. at \n148.  “The point of the protection afforded public employees is to allow public employees a \nvoice on issues actually affecting and interesting the community at large.”  Gragg v. Kentucky \nCabinet for Workforce Development, 289 F.3d 958, 966 (6th Cir. 2002).  The summary provided \nin Meriwether’s complaint makes clear he cannot satisfy this requirement either.   \nUltimately, however, Meriwether’s claim should be dismissed because this is “employee” \nspeech and not “citizen” speech under Garcetti. Even if the plaintiff-employee attempts to cast \nhis  work-related  disputes  as  “matters  of  public  concern”  in  an  attempt  to  support  a  First \nAmendment claim, he must still plead and prove that their speech is made as a citizen.  See, e.g., \nHaynes v. City of Circleville, 474 F.3d 357, 362 (6th Cir. 2007) (dog handler’s criticism of the \npolice chief’s cost-related cutbacks in a canine training program unprotected, although the chief \nwas  responsible  for  the  department’s  ultimate  budgetary  decisions);  and  Garner  v.  City  of \nCuyahoga Falls, 311 Fed. Appx. 896 (6th Cir. 2009) (safety concerns expressed in course of job \n14 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 23 of 38  PAGEID #: 573\n \nwere unprotected).  In sum, Meriwether was not speaking as a concerned private citizen on a \nmatter of public importance, and he was not speaking as an academic on a matter of intellectual \ndebate.  He was simply managing his classroom in a formalistic way.   \nThe written warning he challenges also fails to state any adverse employment action to \nsupport his First Amendment retaliation claim.  See Savage, 665 F.3d at 738; see also Poppy v. \nCity of Willoughby Hills, 96 Fed. Appx. 292, 295 (6th Cir. 2004) (“Poppy fails to explain how \nconduct such as . . . reviewing her time sheets, requesting keys to her office to inspect records \nkept there, or installing a security camera in the hall outside her office adversely affected her \nemployment and thereby deterred her from exercising her rights under the First Amendment.”); \nDennison  v.  Murray  State  Univ.,  465  F.  Supp.  2d  733,  747  (W.D.  Ky.  2006)  (in  First \nAmendment retaliation case, court found that “decrease in the size of Plaintiff’s office and the \nuse of an ‘antiquated’ telephone do not constitute a material adverse employment action.”); \nFercello v. Cty. of Ramsey, 612 F.3d 1069, 1078 (8th Cir. 2010) (in Title VII retaliation case, \nrelocation to smaller office without window found to not be materially adverse employment \naction).  Meriwether’s own conclusory and self-serving allegations about the effect of this \ninvestigation on him personally are irrelevant to this analysis. See Hartsel v. Keys, 87 F.3d 795, \n801-02 (6th Cir. 1996) (conclusory statements, subjective beliefs, not evidence of actual injury).  \nThe Sixth Circuit has held that de minimis actions, including a state agency’s review of a \nplaintiff’s confidential files, do not constitute adverse actions that would deter a person of \nordinary firmness from engaging in protected speech.  See Wurzelbacher v. Jones-Kelley, 675 \nF.3d 580 (6th Cir. 2012).     \nNeither are “an employer’s commencement of an investigation, [or] . . . criticisms, \naccusations,  threats,  or  ‘bad  mouthing’”  enough  to  constitute  adverse  actions  in  First \n15 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 24 of 38  PAGEID #: 574\n \nAmendment retaliation cases. Magley v. Wright, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4612 at *19 (W.D. \nMich. Mar. 30, 2001) (citations omitted); Hornbeak-Denton v. Myers, 361 Fed. Appx. 684, 688 \n(6th Cir. 2010) (O’Connor, J., sitting by designation) (in First Amendment retaliation case, \nfinding  that  “[m]ere  threats  .  .  .  are  generally  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  adverse  action \nrequirement”)  (quoting  Mitchell  v.  Vanderbilt  Univ.,  389  F.3d  177,  182  (6th  Cir.  2004)) \n(alterations in original).  Meriwether fails to even allege an effect in the workplace as a result of \nthis investigation.  In Dennison v. Murray State Univ., 465 F. Supp. 2d 733 (W.D. Ky. 2006), a \nFirst  Amendment  retaliation  case,  the  court  found  that  a  “breakdown  in  communication” \nbetween plaintiff and his supervisor “and any cussing or yelling as a result thereof, does not \nconstitute a material adverse employment action as it did not have a significant detrimental effect \non Plaintiff’s status.”  Id. at 747.   \nMeriwether has failed to meet this standard and his First Amendment claim should be \ndismissed.  \n2.  Meriwether’s “Second Cause of Action” also fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted as it does not base a claim upon \n“speech”  protected  by  the  First  Amendment,  and  his  claim  of \n“content”  or  “viewpoint  discrimination”  and  unconstitutional  over \nbreadth are without merit.   \n \nIn the second of his multiple claims for relief, Meriwether alleges again that his “speech”, \nthe use of a title and pronouns, is protected by the First Amendment, and that the “content” of his \nspeech is subject to “viewpoint discrimination” in violation of the Constitution.  Doc. #1, Comp. \n¶¶ 294.  As discussed above, this is “speech” about how to address students, which is not \nprotected under Garcetti.  The Complaint also generally alleges the policies are overbroad, \nhowever.  In determining whether a policy is unconstitutionally overbroad, the Court first looks \nat whether “the regulation reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.”  \n16 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 25 of 38  PAGEID #: 575\n \nLeonardson v City of E. Lansing, 89 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1990).  Meriwether’s argument fails \non this point, as he only points to his own, unprotected speech to support his claims, and \ntherefore cannot, as a matter of law, demonstrate that the policy prohibits a “substantial amount” \nof constitutionally protected speech.   \nWhen a plaintiff makes a facial challenge to a statue (or policy) as unconstitutional, the \n“facial” challenge is an “overbreadth” challenge.  See Speet v. Schuette, 7226 F.3d 867, 872-73 \n(6th Cir. 2013).  “Only a statute that is substantially overbroad may be invalidated on its face.”  \nSee id., quoting City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987); New York v. Ferber, 458 \nU.S. 747, 769 (1982); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973).  Additionally in a facial \nchallenge, a plaintiff must show substantial overbreadth; that is, that the policy prohibits a \n“substantial amount of protected speech both in an absolute sense and relative to [the policy’s] \nplainly legitimate sweep[.]”  Speet, supra, quoting Carey v. Wolnitzek, 614 F.3d 189, 208 (6th \nCir.  2010).    Again,  since  Meriwether’s  Complaint  relies  only  on  his  own  misunderstood \ninterpretation of the First Amendment, he fails to state a claim that the policy is overbroad.   \nSecond, the Court must address whether the policy is unconstitutionally vague.  See \nLeonardson, supra; see also Dambrot v. Cent. Michigan Univ., 55 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir. \n1995).  Here, the Complaint’s alternative argument that the policies are “unconstitutionally \nvague because they grant University officials unbridled discretion in deciding what constitutes \n‘gender identity’ and ‘gender identity discrimination’”, Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 327, is also without \nmerit, since Meriwether’s own Complaint (and attachments) shows that he was directed multiple \ntimes in how to address the student, and he chose not to follow those straightforward directives.  \nHe can understand the guidance he was given, he simply disagrees with it and refuses to follow \nthe guidance.  The University’s ultimate decision upholding the written warning indicated that it \n17 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 26 of 38  PAGEID #: 576\n \nwas  not  imposed  because  of  any  inadvertent  slip-up  or  mistake  on  Meriwether’s  part,  but \nbecause he failed to stop unfairly singling out the student in a discriminatory manner as he had \nbeen instructed.   \nThe speech in this instance was not rendered by Meriwether during his non-working time, \nbut rather was part of the simple process of how to address a student of the University, during a \ncourse  taught  pursuant  to  University  curriculum  and  policy  requirements,  in  a  University \nclassroom,  and  by  a  Professor  who  was  compensated  by  the  University  and  has  been  an \nemployee of the University for over 20 years.   \nMeriwether has not plausibly alleged that he has ever been subject to potential discipline \nfor  conduct  that  occurred  outside  the  University.    Nonetheless,  courts  have  even  upheld \nenforcement of such discriminatory harassment by a professor outside the classroom, even in the \nface of First Amendment challenges.  See Piggee v. Carl Sandburg College, 464 F.3d 667 (7th \nCir. 2006).  In Piggee, the plaintiff, an instructor at a public community college, upon learning \nthat one of her students was Christian and was gay, placed religious pamphlets in the student’s \nsmock during a clinical teaching session, and invited the student to discuss the pamphlets with \nher at a later time.  The exchange occurred at a private beauty salon away from the college \ncampus.  The pamphlets referred to, among other things, several Biblical lessons which set forth, \nfrom the instructor’s standpoint, the “sinfulness” of homosexuality.  A college investigation \nconcluded  that  the  student  was  sexually  harassed.    The  instructor  was  ordered  to  cease \ncommenting on sexual orientation and religion, and the instructor’s contract was ordered to cease \nsuch behavior and her contract was not renewed the following year.  The instructor sued in \nfederal court on theories including violation of constitutional free speech, free exercise, and due \nprocess rights.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the college on all claims, and \n18 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 27 of 38  PAGEID #: 577\n \nthe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Court rejected Piggee’s argument that the \ncollege could not restrict her speech because it happened in a private salon.  The Court noted that \nthe college had an interest that the employee “stay on message” when interacting with students in \ntheir  clinical  work  off  campus.    See  Piggee,  464  F.3d  at  672.    The  directives  placed  on \nMeriwether were much narrower than that alleged in Piggee.   \nMeriwether’s  lawsuit  is  a  similar  attempt  to  challenge  conduct-related  policies, \nprohibiting discriminatory conduct and harassing conduct, under a superficial First Amendment \nanalysis.    The  same  arguments  made  here  could  be  made  regarding  policies  on  equal \nemployment  opportunities,  non-discrimination  and  discriminatory  harassment  for  every \nemployer in the United States who complies with Title IX for institutions of higher education, \nand  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  and  various  other  federal  and  state  non-\ndiscrimination laws.  The vagueness and overbreadth doctrines are prudential doctrines, which \nare only relied upon by courts to strike down statutes (or policies) “as a last resort.”  See Staley v. \nJones, 239 F.3d 769, 776-77 (6th Cir. 2001)(quoting Broadrick v. U.S., 413 U.S. 601, 613 \n(1973)).  “Sustaining a facial attack to the constitutionality of a state law … is momentous and \nconsequential.  It is an ‘exceptional remedy.’”  Speet, supra, quoting Carey v Wolnitzek, 614 \nF.3d  189,  201  (6th  Cir.  2010).    Meriwether’s  difference  of  opinion  with  the  University’s \nadministration does not a constitutional claim make.   \n3.   Meriwether’s “Third Cause of Action” for “compelled speech” also \nshould be dismissed because his “speech” is not protected by the First \nAmendment.   \n \nMeriwether does not state a claim for “compelled speech” for similar reasons cited in the \narguments above, based above all on Garcetti.  Neither has Meriwether stated a claim for First \nAmendment  retaliation,  because  he  has  not  suffered  an  actionable  injury,  or  “adverse \n19 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 28 of 38  PAGEID #: 578\n \nemployment  action”  under  Savage  v.  Gee,  supra.    On  this  claim  of  “compelled  speech”, \nMeriwether’s argument is particularly weak, since he was offered an alternative by the Dean on \nmultiple occasions to simply stop using all articles/titles (i.e. “Mr.” or “Ms.”) when he addressed \nstudents in his class, and he rejected this option.  See Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 146-47, and Exhibit 17, \nDean’s Letter of May 29, 2018.   \nFor all of these First Amendment claims, Professor Meriwether’s claims are without \nmerit and should be dismissed, since it involves his duties as a public employee, and instructor at \na public institution, and he has not suffered any recognized adverse employment action under \nwell-established case law.  These claims should be dismissed.   \n4.     Meriwether’s “Fourth Cause of Action” for violation of his rights to \nfreely exercise his religion does not state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted. \n \nIn the constitutional context, only a law that is not neutral or of general applicability \n“must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to \nadvance that interest.”  See Doe v. Cong. of the United States, 891 F.3d 578, 591 (6th Cir. 2018) \n(free exercise challenge asserting that U.S. currency use of the motto “In God We Trust” motto \npromotes Christian monotheistic message), quoting Church of the Lukumi Bablu Aye, Inc. v. City \nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531-32 (1993).  The nondiscrimination policies challenged by the \nComplaint are part of the University’s obligations under Title IX and Title VII, and fall into this \ncategory of neutral rules of general applicability.  The Supreme Court has held that “neutral, \ngenerally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of religion usually do not violate \nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.” Doe, 891 F.3d at 591, quoting Holt v. Hobbs, \n135 S. Ct. 853, 859 (2015)(citing Emp’t Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 \nU.S. 872, 878-82 (1990)).   \n20 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 29 of 38  PAGEID #: 579\n \nThe non-discrimination policy challenged here is neutral, and thus does not fall within \ncaselaw requiring a “compelling” governmental interest or that need be “narrowly tailored.”  The \npolicy  is  a  requirement  of  the  University  based  on  federal  and  state  laws  prohibiting \ndiscrimination.  A law, or the non-discrimination policies challenged in this case, is not neutral \n“if the object of [the] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious \nmotivation,” or if the “purpose of [the] law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct.”  \nDoe, 891 F.3d at 591, quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533.  Meriwether does not, and cannot, point \nto any language in these policies that has as its object or purpose, the suppression of the Christian \nreligion or religious practices.   \nNeither  does  the  Complaint  state  a  claim  for  some  “as  applied”  challenge  to  the \nimplementation of the policies in this case.  Although Meriwether, based on the attachments to \nhis Complaint, frequently injected the subject of his religious beliefs into his challenges to the \nnon-discrimination policy, the investigation of his conduct, and its application to his conduct \ntowards the student in his classroom, his own Complaint demonstrates that the policy is one of \ngeneral, neutral applicability.  His Complaint states that he was first notified by his Union of the \nnon-discrimination policy, and its applicability in the transgender context, back in August 2016.  \nSee Doc. #1, Comp. ¶¶ 104-05.  The policy is neutral on its face, and, given the straightforward, \nundisputed nature of the conduct he admits in his Complaint, his attempts to cast this after-the-\nfact as prejudiced against his Christian beliefs ignores the neutral, general applicability of the \npolicy.  That same general directive was enforced throughout.   \n5.      Meriwether’s  “Fifth  Cause  of  Action”  for  being  subject  to \n“unconstitutional conditions” does not state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.   \n \nIn his “Fifth Cause of Action”, Meriwether baselessly contends that his “status as a \n21 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 30 of 38  PAGEID #: 580\n \nprofessor  in  good  standing  at  the  University”  and  his  employment  at  the  University,  are \njeopardized by the “unconstitutional condition” the University has placed on him in violation of \nhis First Amendment rights.  Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 316.  He alleges that his “receipt of state \nbenefits”  (i.e.,  his  employment)  is  threatened  unless  he  “surrenders”  his  “constitutionally \nprotected  rights  to  freedom  of  speech,  free  exercise  of  religion,  due  process,  and  equal \nprotection.”  See id., ¶¶ 317-19.  This claim essentially restates a First Amendment claim, and \nshould be dismissed.   \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized and applied a form of the “unconstitutional \nconditions” doctrine in public employment cases involving the First Amendment and “political \npatronage” challenges.  See, e.g., O’Hare Truck Serv. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 716-17 \n(1996); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976); see, also, McCloud v. Testa, 97 F.3d 1536, 1550-51 \n(6th Cir. 1996).  Notably, Meriwether remains a faculty member with full tenure rights.  To the \nextent Meriwether goes on at length about his own beliefs, whether he labels them “personal”, \n“political” or “religious”, the only adverse action he challenges here is the written warning, and \nthe only act he challenges is the manner in which he addresses the student in his classroom, \nincluding references to “titles” and “pronouns”.  As discussed above, the ministerial act of \nreferring to a student as “Ms.” or “she” is not First Amendment protected speech.  Since this \nclaim is derivative of his First Amendment claims, it should also be dismissed.   \n6.    Meriwether’s “Sixth Cause of Action” and Due Process Claim(s) that \nthe  University’s  non-discrimination  policies  are  “overbroad”  or \n“vague” are without merit and should be dismissed.    \n \nAs  discussed  above,  particularly  in  Section  III.B.2.  of  this  Motion  to  Dismiss,  \nMeriwether’s arguments of “due process” violations are without merit and should be dismissed.  \nIn the Sixth “Cause of Action”, the Complaint alleges that the non-discrimination policies of the \n22 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 31 of 38  PAGEID #: 581\n \nUniversity are unconstitutionally overbroad, alleging that Meriwether’s “expression regarding \ngender identity is protected by the First Amendment.” See Doc. #1, Comp.  ¶ 324.  This is the \nsame argument above and, as discussed, the simple act of the use of a title or a pronoun during a \nclass discussion is not speech protected under the First Amendment, based on Garcetti, supra.  In \ndetermining whether a policy is unconstitutionally overbroad, the Court first looks at whether \n“the regulation reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.”  Leonardson v \nCity of E. Lansing, 89 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1990).  Meriwether’s argument fails on this point, \nas he only points to his own, unprotected speech to support his claims.   \nWhen a plaintiff makes a facial challenge to a statue (or policy) as unconstitutional, the \n“facial” challenge is an “overbreadth” challenge.  See Speet v. Schuette, 7226 F.3d 867, 872-73 \n(6th Cir. 2013).  “Only a statute that is substantially overbroad may be invalidated on its face.”  \nSee id., quoting City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987); New York v. Ferber, 458 \nU.S. 747, 769 (1982); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973).  In a facial challenge, a \nplaintiff  must  show  substantial  overbreadth;  that  is,  that  the  policy  prohibits  a  “substantial \namount of protected speech both in an absolute sense and relative to [the policy’s] plainly \nlegitimate sweep[.]”  Speet, supra, quoting Carey v. Wolnitzek, 614 F.3d 189, 208 (6th Cir. 2010).  \nAgain, since Meriwether’s Complaint relies only on his own misunderstood interpretation of the \nFirst Amendment, he fails to state a claim that the policy is overbroad.   \nSecond, the Court must address whether the policy is unconstitutionally vague.  See \nLeonardson, supra; see also Dambrot v. Cent. Michigan Univ., 55 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir. \n1995).  Here, the Complaint’s alternative argument that the policies are “unconstitutionally \nvague because they grant University officials unbridled discretion in deciding what constitutes \n‘gender identity’ and ‘gender identity discrimination’”, Doc. #1, Comp. ¶ 327, is also without \n23 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 32 of 38  PAGEID #: 582\n \nmerit, since Meriwether’s own Complaint (and attachments) show that he was directed multiple \ntimes in how to address the student, and he chose not to follow those straightforward directives.  \nHe can understand the guidance he was given, he simply disagrees with it and refuses to follow \nthe  guidance.    The  Court  should  disregard  the  hypothetical  and  speculative  confusion \nMeriwether alleges based on what “some sources” say, because he has not plausibly alleged any \nsuch  confusion  occurred  under  the  University’s  policies  or  practices.    See  Doc.  #1,  ¶  72 \n(referring to an “infinite” number of possible pronouns based on the Univ. of Cal., Davis \nLGBTQIA Res. Ctr., which is not at issue in this case).    \nA policy will be considered “void for vagueness” if it (1) “denies fair notice of the \nstandard of conduct to which a citizen is held accountable” or (2) constitutes “an unrestricted \ndelegation  of  power,”  inviting  “arbitrary,  discriminatory  and  overzealous  enforcement.”  \nLeonardson, 896 F.2d at 196, quoting Washington Mobilization Committee v. Cullinane, 566 \nF.2d 107, (D.C. Cir. 1977).  Here, Meriwether’s Complaint states that he was notified by his \nUnion of these standards in August 2016, and that he had multiple interactions with his Dean and \nDepartment Chair on the issue before the investigation he challenges was even initiated.  In the \nend, he was given only a written warning, which is not even an adverse action under well-\nestablished First Amendment case law, and he was afforded the opportunity to challenge the \naction  through  the  applicable  collective  bargaining  agreement’s  grievance  process,  which \nincluded Union representation, a process which was begun but abandoned.   \n7.    Meriwether’s “Seventh Cause of Action” for violation of his rights to \nEqual Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment does not state a \nclaim based upon a suspect classification or fundamental right, and \nshould be dismissed.   \n \nThe Complaint’s “Seventh Cause of Action” also misunderstands a claim under the Equal \nProtection clause, and should be dismissed.  The Equal Protection Clause “protects against \n24 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 33 of 38  PAGEID #: 583\n \narbitrary classifications, and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally.”  Jackson \nv. Jamrog, 411 F.3d 615, 618 (6th Cir. 2005).  Although the Complaint generally alleges that \nProfessor Meriwether is “similarly situated to other professors at the University”, he alleges \ndisparate treatment based upon his refusal to “endorse” concepts of “gender identity.”  Doc. #1, \n¶¶ 331-32.  His claim essentially restates his varied First Amendment claims which, as has been \ndiscussed above, are not based upon “speech” protected by the First Amendment.  Essentially, \nthe Complaint alleges an archaic “class of one” theory of the Equal Protection Clause that has \nbeen dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court.  See Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 \nU.S. 591, 598 (2008) (“[T]he class of one theory of equal protection does not apply in the public \nemployment context.”).  Meriwether’s claim is based on his conduct in the classroom, and that is \nhis only argument for a denial of equal protection; it is not based upon any recognized theory of \nan “arbitrary classification” under the Equal Protection clause. This claim should be dismissed.   \n8.    Meriwether’s  Eighth  Cause  of  Action  for  his  “Rights  of \nConscience  and  Free  Exercise  of  Religion”  under  the  Ohio \nConstitution’s Art. I, § 7, should be dismissed, either based on \nsovereign immunity grounds, or for prudential reasons.   \n \nAs discussed above, the Defendants contend that Meriwether’s claims under the U.S. \nConstitution are all without merit and should be dismissed.  Any state law claims against the \nDefendants  should  be  dismissed  as  not  within  this  Court’s  jurisdiction.    Shawnee  State \nUniversity is a public institution and “instrumentality of the state” of Ohio.  See, e.g., O.R.C. §§ \n3362.01  et  seq.    (enabling  statutes  for  Shawnee  State  University).    Setting  aside  whether \nMeriwether’s claims have any merit, his state law claims are barred in this Court by sovereign \nimmunity as interpreted under the Eleventh Amendment.  See, e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 120-21 (1984); see also VIBO Corp., Inc. v. Conway, et al., \n669 F.3d 675, 691 (6th Cir. 2012).  “[T]he Eleventh Amendment bars suits for money damages or \n25 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 34 of 38  PAGEID #: 584\n \ninjunctive relief against SSU [Shawnee State University]…”  Reeves v. Shawnee State Univ., \n2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29764 (S.D. Ohio March 2, 2017)(Dlott, J.).  Meriwether’s claims \nalthough denominated as claims against Board members, administrators and employees of the \nUniversity in their official capacity for nominal damages and injunctive relief, still fall within \nthis immunity.  See id.  The State of Ohio has not waived its sovereign immunity by consenting \nto federal courts’ jurisdiction over claims against the State of Ohio.  See, e.g., Manning v. Ohio \nState Library Bd., 62 Ohio St. 3d 24 (1991); Leaman v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Retardation & \nDevelopmental Disabilities, 825 F.2d 946, 954 (6th Cir. 1987) (en banc).  Rather, Ohio has \nwaived its sovereign immunity only as to actions filed in the Court of Claims of Ohio.  O.R.C. § \n2743.02; see also O.R.C. § 2743.03(A)(2) (“If the claimant in a civil action … also files a claim \nfor declaratory judgement, injunctive relief, or other equitable relief that arises out of the same \ncircumstances that gave rise to the civil action … the court of claims has exclusive original \njurisdiction to hear and determine that claim in that civil action.”)     \nAlternatively, absent the jurisdictional argument, if Meriwether seeks to assert that the \nOhio  Constitution  has  protections  that,  in  this  case,  are  broader  or  different  than  the  U.S. \nConstitution, this Court should not, in the first instance, serve as a forum to so interpret Ohio’s \nconstitutional protections.  The Court should abstain from hearing any claim for a different \ninterpretation  or  novel  extension  of  Ohio’s  constitution  under  doctrines,  such  as  Burford \nabstention, \nWhere  timely  and  adequate  state-court  review  is  available,  a \nfederal court sitting in equity must decline to interfere with the \nproceedings or orders of state administrative agencies:  (1) when \nthere  are  ‘difficult  questions  of  state  law  bearing  on  policy \nproblems  of  substantial  public  import  whose  importance \ntranscends the result in the case then at bar’; or (2) where the \nexercise of federal review of the question in a case and in similar \ncases would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent \n26 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 35 of 38  PAGEID #: 585\n \npolicy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern. \n \nNew Orleans Pub. Serv. Inc. v. New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989), quoting Colorado River \nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976), interpreting Burford v. Sun \nOil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943).  In this Eighth Cause of Action, assuming Plaintiff sought to \nproceed with this Ohio state constitutional claim independently of his other federal claims, \nMeriwether  would  be  seeking  to  invoke  Ohio’s  state  constitution  to  invalidate  a \nnondiscrimination policy the University is obliged to use to comply with federal law.  This claim \nshould be dismissed.   \n9.    Meriwether’s  “Ninth  Cause  of  Action”  for  “Breach  of \nContract” should be dismissed, either on sovereign immunity \ngrounds or because the collective bargaining agreement with \nthe  University  is  enforced  exclusively  through  a  grievance \nprocess that results in final and binding arbitration.   \n \n  Plaintiff’s “breach of contract” claim does not state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  As discussed above in III.B.8., Meriwether’s state law claims are not in this Court’s \njurisdiction,  and  barred  by  sovereign  immunity.    Additionally,  the  collective  bargaining \nagreement is not a common law “contract”, but instead is a statutory agreement under Chapter \n4117  of  the  Ohio  Revised  Code;  it  contains  an  Article  on  “Grievance  Procedures”  that \nculminates in binding arbitration.  See Doc. #1, Comp. Ex. 4, PAGEID # 75 – 226.  Under Ohio \nlaw, it is enforced through the agreement’s dispute resolution process, not through a breach of \ncontract lawsuit in Court.  Alternatively, if a Union member such as Professor Meriwether \nbelieves he is not being fairly represented by his Union, he may even file an unfair labor practice \ncharge  against  his  Union  with  Ohio’s  State  Employment  Relations  Board.    (O.R.C.  § \n4117.11(B)(6)  (“It  is  an  unfair  labor  practice  for  an  employee  organization,  its  agents,  or \nrepresentatives or pubic employees to … [f]ail to fairly represent all public employees in a \n27 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 36 of 38  PAGEID #: 586\n \nbargaining unit[.]”) \n  Under Ohio law, which governs statutory agreements such as the collective bargaining \nagreement relied upon by the Complaint, courts are generally without jurisdiction to entertain \ndisputes under collective bargaining agreements established under O.R.C. Chapter 4117.  See, \ne.g., State ex rel. Wilkinson v. Reed, 99 Ohio St.3d 106 (2003).  Specifically, courts are without \njurisdiction to entertain a claim that a public employer subject to O.R.C. Chapter 4117 has \nviolated  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  where  the  agreement  provides  for  the  final  and \nbinding arbitration of grievances.  As the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized “an aggrieved \nworker whose employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement that provides for \nbinding  arbitration  will  generally  be  deemed  to  have  relinquished  his  or  her  right  to  act \nindependently of the union in all matters related to or arising from the contract, except to the \nlimited extent that the agreement explicitly provides to the contrary.”  Leon v. Boardman Twp., \n100 Ohio St.3d 335, 340 (¶ 17) (2003).  See also, Null v. Ohio Dep’t of Mental Retardation & \nDevelopmental Disabilities, 137 Ohio App.3d 152 (Franklin Ct. App. 2000) (precluding an \nemployee’s effort to sue on a matter covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a binding \narbitration clause); see also Brannen v. Kings Local Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ., 144 Ohio App. 3d \n620, 628 (Ohio Ct. App. Warren 2001) (holding that “to the extent that appellant’s claim that the \nactions of the board of education violated their rights under the collective bargaining agreement, \nbinding arbitration is their exclusive remedy and the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider the \nmerits of the complaint”).   \n  As relevant here, O.R.C. § 4117.10(A) provides, in part, as follows: \nAn  agreement  between  a  public  employer  and  an  exclusive \nrepresentative entered into pursuant to this chapter governs the \nwages,  hours,  and  terms  and  conditions  of  public  employment \ncovered by the agreement.  If the agreement provides for a final \n28 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 22 Filed: 01/07/19 Page: 37 of 38  PAGEID #: 587\n \nand  binding  arbitration  of  grievances,  public  employers, \nemployees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that \ngrievance procedure …. \n \n(Emphasis added).  To allow Meriwether’s claim for “breach of contract” to continue in this case \nwould render this statutory language meaningless.  As with Meriwether’s other claims, this \nbreach of contract claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and/or is not \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court, and should be dismissed. \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants submit that this Motion to Dismiss is well-taken \nand respectfully request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint in its entirety as a matter of \nlaw.     \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nMICHAEL DEWINE (0009181) \nOhio Attorney General \n \n/s/ Rory P.

Introduction and Plaintiff’s factual allegations. \n  Plaintiff Nicholas Meriwether, a Professor at Shawnee State University, filed the present \nlawsuit after he received a written warning following an investigation and the finding that he was \ndiscriminating against a transgender student in his classroom.  He also challenges the directive to \naddress that same transgender student using a female title (“Miss” or “Ms.”) and pronouns \n(“she/her”) or by not using such pronouns or titles to address any of the students in the class.  \nMeriwether  objects  to  the  latter  directive  in  particular,  citing  his  strongly-held  personal, \nphilosophical  and/or  religious  beliefs,  and  contending  the  University’s  investigation  and \ndirective lends “credence to cultural ideas Dr. Meriwether does not share or wish to advance.”  \nDoc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶ 4.  Meriwether’s Complaint asserts nine (9) overlapping claims for \nrelief based on the written warning he received for his conduct towards a transgender student in \nhis classroom, and his objections to the “cultural ideas” the directive represents.   \nMeriwether has been a professor and member of the Shawnee State University faculty \nsince 1996.  Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶ 93.  In almost 300 paragraphs of factual allegations, \nMeriwether recounts interactions over a period of two years that he had with his Union and the \nUniversity’s administrators on the issue of transgenderism.  He alleges that in August 2016, he \nwas notified by his then-Union President of a U.S. Department of Education “Dear Colleague” \nletter on issues of transgenderism, and that his Union President informed faculty members that \nthey could face “disciplinary action from the University if they ‘refused to use a [student’s] \nrequested  name  or  pronoun.’”  Id.,  ¶¶  106-07.    Based  upon  this  notice  from  his  Union, \nMeriwether alleges that he contacted Dr. Roberta Milliken, Dean of the University’s College of \nArts & Sciences, on or around October 27, 2016, inquiring what University policies required of \n1 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 9 of 29  PAGEID #: 1877\nfaculty on issues related to gender identity.  See id. ¶¶ 32, 110.  He alleges the Dean informed \nhim at that time that faculty must use “a student’s preferred pronoun” when addressing a student \n“regardless of the professor’s convictions or views on the subject.”  See id., ¶ 109.  On or around \nNovember 3, 2016, Professor Meriwether also addressed the issue with Department Chair for the \nUniversity’s Department of English and the Humanities, Dr. Jennifer Pauley.  See id., ¶¶ 36-37, \n117.1    During  this  meeting,  he  alleges  she  made  negative  statements  regarding  “Christian \ndoctrines” and “exhibited hostility toward … his religious beliefs.”  See id., ¶¶ 118 – 122.   \nAfter Meriwether took a semester-long sabbatical in 2017, he returned to the University \nin January 2018, and began teaching a class titled “Political Philosophy.” Doc. #34, Amend. \nComp. ¶ 125.  On January 9, 2018, the first day of class, Meriwether answered a student’s \nquestion, “Yes, sir” because he viewed the student as male.  See id., ¶¶ 128-30.  After class, the \nstudent approached Meriwether, and stated that the student was transgender, and asked to be \naddressed with “feminine titles and pronouns.”  See id., ¶ 140.  Meriwether alleges that, when he \ntold the student that “he was not sure students can dictate how professors must refer to them[.]”, \nthe student uttered a profanity [c---], and circled Meriwether in a belligerent and threatening \nfashion, and “promised” to have Meriwether, a Professor with full tenure rights, fired if he did \nnot “accede” to the student’s demands.  See id., ¶¶ 141–44.  Meriwether alleges that, after he \nnotified the Dean of Students of this interaction, on January 11, 2018, Dean Milliken visited \nMeriwether’s office and asked him to begin referring to students by their last names only, and \n                                                 \n1 Although Dr. Pauley serves as “Department Chairperson”, under the collective bargaining \nagreement between the University and the Shawnee Education Association, Department Chairs \nare members of the bargaining unit.  Doc. #34, Exhibit 4, Art. 5, § 1.A.3, p. 11.  The Department \nChair is not an administrator of University policy, and cannot impose discipline or materially \naffect the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s employment any more that other faculty members \nunder the University’s shared governance model.   \n2 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 10 of 29  PAGEID #: 1878\n“to eliminate all gender references from his expression.”  See id., ¶¶ 153-54.  Meriwether alleges \nthat he would not agree to this, but instead proposed that he would continue to refer to his other \nstudents by “Mr.”, “Mrs.”, “Ms.” or “Miss”, but that he would refer to the objecting student by \nthe student’s last name only, and that Dean Milliken accepted this proposal.  See id., ¶¶ 157-58.  \nMeriwether alleges that this arrangement continued for about two weeks, until January 25, 2018, \nwhen Dean Milliken came to speak with him and indicated that the student was unhappy with \nhow he addressed the student in class and had indicated that student might file a Title IX \ngrievance.  See id., ¶¶ 160-61.  Meriwether also alleges, on February 1, 2018, he inadvertently \nreferred to the student as “Mr.” during class, and then corrected himself.  See id.¸¶ 165.   \nOn February 13, 2018, Meriwether received a letter from Dean Milliken, outlining her \nposition on the matter.  Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶ 185, Ex. 9 (letter).  The letter stated it was \nformal  notice  that  if  Meriwether  did  not  conform  his  conduct  to  the  expectations  of  the \nUniversity, it may lead to an investigation that could result in formal disciplinary action.  See id.  \nA formal investigation was subsequently initiated.   See id., ¶¶ 189-91.  Meriwether alleges the \ninitiation and conduct of the investigation violated several provisions of the collective bargaining \nagreement,  see  id.  ¶¶  196  –  207.    The  “Investigation  Report”,  attached  to  the  Amended \nComplaint as Exhibit 13, indicates that Meriwether was interviewed on March 15, 2018.  See id, \np. 1.  The “Findings” of the report stated, “Professor Meriwether has been reluctant to address \n[the student] using she/her pronouns.  When called upon in class, [the student] is referred to as \n“[last name]” whereas all other students are addressed using formal Mr. Surname and Ms. \nSurname.  …  Professor  Meriwether  refuses  to  use  preferred  pronouns  when  addressing \ntransgender students.  He views this as a matter of academic freedom and truth that he intends to \nexercise.  Professor Meriwether on several occasions communicated that he does not recognize \n3 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 11 of 29  PAGEID #: 1879\ntransgenderism – he specifically stated that he believes transgender is a lie and mental illness and \nthat Professors should not have to change.”  See id., Ex. 13, pp. 3- 4.  Based on interviews with \nstudents, and the interview with Meriwether, he was found to have been in violation of the \nUniversity’s non-discrimination/harassment policy.  See id., Ex. 13, p. 4.   \nOn April 18, 2018, Dean Milliken notified Meriwether that based upon the finding of \ndisparate treatment of the student, a conference would be scheduled with him and his Union \nrepresentative.  See Doc. #34, ¶ 233, and Ex. 14.  Meriwether was allowed to reschedule a \nmeeting with the Dean (and his Union representative) from April 27, 2018, to May 9, 2018.  See \nDoc. #34, Ex. 16, p. 1.  On May 29, 2018, he received a report from the Dean, summarizing the \ndates, investigation findings, and the Dean’s recommendations.  See id., Ex. 17.  Meriwether \nthen met with the Provost.  See id., Ex. 18.  The Provost adopted the Dean’s recommendation for \ndisciplinary  action,  and  recommended  that  a  “letter  of  warning”  be  placed  in  Professor \nMeriwether’s personnel file on June 14, 2018.  See id., Exs. 19, 20.   \nOn June 22, 2018, a written warning was placed in Professor Meriwether’s personnel file, \nconsistent  with  the  collective  bargaining  agreement.    See  Doc.  #34,  Ex.  20.    Meriwether \ncontacted his Union, and pursued a grievance.  See id., Ex. 22.  On or around August 16, 2018, \nMeriwether’s Union filed a formal challenge to the written warning with the University.  See id., \nEx. 23.  Meriwether and his Union Representative met with the Provost on August 22, 2018.  See \nid., Ex. 25.  The grievance was denied, and the decision to issue a written warning was upheld.  \nSee id.  A subsequent appeal to the University’s President was submitted, again consistent with \nthe collective bargaining agreement.  See id., Ex. 26.  Another grievance meeting was held, on or \naround  September  14,  2018,  including  the  attendance  of  Meriwether  and  his  Union \nRepresentative, and a designee for the President, Labor Relations Director David Zender.  See id.  \n4 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 12 of 29  PAGEID #: 1880\nIn affirming the imposition of a written warning, the President’s designee noted that the written \nwarning was not based on any inadvertent slip-up or single incident.  See id., Ex. 27, President’s \nGrievance Response, Oct. 4, 2018. (“Meriwether acknowledged that he refused to stop singling \nout  the  student  because  of  her  gender  identity  after  receiving  the  notice  of  the  policy’s \nrequirements  and  options  to  accommodate  his  religious  beliefs….  Meriwether’s  differential \ntreatment of the student was a violation of SSU’s anti-discrimination policy.”  Id., Ex. 27, \nPAGEID # 1799).  No facts are alleged that the Union took the matter to arbitration.   \nIn the present lawsuit, Meriwether seeks to challenge the imposition of a written warning, \nchallenging it under multiple, overlapping legal theories.  Meriwether’s Amended Complaint \nalso attaches two Shawnee State University policies and procedures he challenges:  (1) the “Non-\nDiscrimination/Sexual  Harassment”  Policy,  5.01REV;  and  (2)  “Reporting  &  Investigating \nSexual Assault, Sexual Misconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination”, 5.01:2REV.  Doc. #34, \nAmend. Comp. Exhs. 1 and 2.  He asserts similar, overlapping claims tied to his challenges to the \nwritten warning he received.     \nII.  Meriwether’s pleading burden and the standard of review.    \nThe standard of review of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was discussed in \nthe Defendants’ first motion to dismiss.  (Doc. #22).  The standard turns on whether the well-\npled factual allegations state a claim for relief that is “plausible.”  See Dudenhoefer v. Fifth Third \nBancorp, 692 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir. 2012), quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nThe Defendants’ motion to dismiss focused heavily on Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 \n(2006), and the fact that this lawsuit over a written warning because Meriwether would not \nsimply address the student in a courteous manner through the use of titles (“Ms.” or “Miss”) or \npronouns (“she/her”) did not involve his speech as a “private citizen” but instead was part of his \n5 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 13 of 29  PAGEID #: 1881\nduties as a public employee.  Meriwether’s attorneys apparently perceived the force of Garcetti \nin this case, since the Amended Complaint’s only noteworthy change in the nine (9) “Cause of \nAction” portions from the first Complaint was to add the phrase “in and out of the classroom” \nseven times.  See Doc. #34, ¶¶ 309, 318, 329, 333, 349, 357 and 365.  This cosmetic change does \nnot materially alter the arguments from the Defendants original motion to dismiss.  Whether \nMeriwether’s “speech” is protected by the First Amendment is a question of law for the Court.  \nSee Fox v. Traverse City Area Pub. Schs. Bd. of Edn., 605 F.3d 345, 350-51 (6th Cir. 2010).   \nAlthough so-called “heightened pleading” is not required, see, e.g., Goad v. Mitchell, 297 \nF.3d 497 (6th Cir. 2002), a court is not required to accept a plaintiff’s summary or conclusory \nallegations as true.  See Lillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 726 (6th Cir. 1996).  \nThe basis for Meriwether’s lawsuit is not in dispute, and captured in his original Complaint, and \nthe voluminous attachments thereto, and the Court need not accept the “unwarranted factual \ninferences” that the Amended Complaint attempts to create by adding a conclusory phrase like \n“in and out of the classroom.”  See, e.g., Mixon v. Ohio, 193 F.3d 389, 400 (6th Cir. 1999).  The \nplaintiff has an obligation to provide more than “formulaic recitations” to state a plausible claim.  \nSee Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  As the Court explained in \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.662, 678 (2009), the standard requires the Complaint to “state a claim \nto  relief  that  is  plausible  on  its  face”  and  “mere  conclusory  statements  do  not  suffice…”  \nAshcroft, 556 U.S. at 678, citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 – 57.  As will be discussed below, \nunder this standard, the Court should dismiss all of Meriwether’s claims, and this lawsuit.   \nIII.  Law & Argument.  \n  The legal analysis that follows tracks the arguments made in the Defendants’ original \nmotion to dismiss.  (Doc. #22).  III.A. of the Argument explains why the individually-named \n6 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 14 of 29  PAGEID #: 1882\nmembers of the Board of Trustees, and Department Chair Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed.  \nIII.B.  of  the  Argument  tracks  the  nine  (9)  “Cause  of  Action”  sections  of  the  Amended \nComplaint, which are nearly identical to the initial Complaint.  (Doc. #33 – Redacted).   \nA.    The individually-named members of the Board of Trustees and Department \nChair Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed. \n \n  The claims against the individually-named Board of Trustees members, and Department \nChair Jennifer Pauley, should be dismissed.  Meriwether asserts no fact, allegation, or even \nsuspicion  that  any  of  the  Trustees  were  involved  in  any  of  the  actions  at  the  core  of  his \nconstitutional challenges.  The Amended Complaint only generally alleges that the Trustees have \n“final policymaking authority for rules and regulations that govern the University” and that the \nTrustees “have not modified the policies challenged herein.”  See Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶¶ \n13 – 18.  He does not allege any specific acts that the Trustees had anything to do with \ndeveloping or instituting the policies he challenges, or that they were involved in communicating \nwith him or carrying out the action he challenges under the University’s policies.  Having alleged \nno identifiable facts against the Trustees at all, he has failed to adequately plead a claim against \nthem, and the Court should dismiss them as parties.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Lawsuits \nagainst state officials in their official capacities are the same as suits against the state itself.  See \nWill v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  It is well settled in the Sixth Circuit \nthat Ohio’s public universities are instrumentalities of the state and, consequently, protected by \nthe state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.  See, e.g., Hall v. Med. Coll. Of Ohio, 742 F.2d 299, \n307 (6th Cir. 1984).  By naming the Trustees in their official capacity only, the state becomes the \nreal party in interest by virtue of the Trustees’ positions because “a suit against a state official in \nhis or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official’s \noffice.”  See Will, 491 U.S. at 71.  These defendants should be dismissed. \n7 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 15 of 29  PAGEID #: 1883\n    In addition, Department Chair Dr. Jennifer Pauley should be dismissed.  The Amended \nComplaint makes the same conclusory allegations that Pauley “possesses the authority  and \nresponsibility for governing and regulating faculty in the Department of English and Humanities \nat the University” and that her duties include “overseeing” Professor Meriwether.  Doc. #34, ¶¶ \n37-38.  However, the collective bargaining agreement states that the position of “Department \nChairperson”, is a position in the faculty bargaining unit.  Doc. #34, Ex. 4, Art. 5, § 1.A.3, p. 11.  \nThe Department Chair is not an administrator of University policy, and cannot impose discipline \nor materially affect the terms and conditions of his employment, any more so than other faculty \ncan under academia’s shared governance system.  See id., Ex. 4, Art. 18.   \nB.    Meriwether fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against \nany of the Defendants.   \n \n  Each of Meriwether’s claims fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nAlthough some of the claims and controlling case law overlap, they will be discussed below in \nthe order in which they are pled in Meriwether’s Amended Complaint.   \n1.  Meriwether’s “First Cause of Action” does not state a claim upon which \nrelief  can  be  granted  because  his  refusal  to  use  a  pronoun  or  title  in \naddressing one student in his classroom was not “speech” protected by the \nFirst Amendment, the University was within its rights to direct him on how \nto address the student, and he did not suffer an adverse employment action.   \n \nIn his first claim, Meriwether alleges that he has been punished for “expressing his views \nregarding gender identity both in and out of the classroom.”  Doc. #34, ¶ 309.  However, a plain \nreading of the Amended Complaint and interactions indicates that the only interaction that is the \nsubject of the University’s policies is Meriwether’s refusal to respect the “choice of titles and \npronouns” of one student in his classroom.  See id., ¶ 310.  The simple, ministerial act of using a \n“title” and/or “pronoun” or not when addressing students is part of Meriwether’s responsibilities \nas a Professor at the University, and not a forum for him to express his personal beliefs.  To state \n8 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 16 of 29  PAGEID #: 1884\na claim for First Amendment retaliation, a public employee must show that:  (1) his expressions \nwere protected by the First Amendment; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) \nthe adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the exercise of his constitutional \nrights.  See Savage v. Gee, 665 F.3d 732, 738 (6th Cir. 2012), citing Fox v. Traverse City Area \nPub. Schs. Bd. of Edn., 605 F.3d 345, 348 (6th Cir. 2010).  Meriwether cannot meet any of these \nelements.   \nWhether a public employee’s speech is protected by the First Amendment is a question of \nlaw for the court.  See Fox, 605 F.3d at 350.  The lengthy factual allegations and attachments to \nthe Amended Complaint give the Court an ample record to resolve this legal issue.  Meriwether’s \n“speech” here is as a public employee, and not “as a citizen” in the language of Connick v. \nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 146-47 (1983).  A government employee’s speech is not protected where it \nis made “pursuant to his duties.”  Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006).  Meriwether \ncannot satisfy this Garcetti requirement because the simple act of the use of titles (“Ms.” or \n“Miss”) and pronouns (“she/her”) relate to his position as a classroom instructor addressing \nstudents of the University in that capacity and are not protected by the First Amendment.  The \nGarcetti case established that the restrictions the Constitution places upon the government in its \ncapacity  as  lawmaker  and  sovereign  are  not  the  same  restrictions  that  it  places  upon  the \ngovernment as an employer.   \nNeither are Meriwether’s allegations that his use of titles and pronouns are part of his \n“academic freedom” protected by the First Amendment.  The Sixth Circuit has held that teaching \n“methods” are not entitled to First Amendment protections in the way that academic arguments \nmay be protected.  See Frieder v. Morehead State Univ., 770 F.3d 428, 430 (6th Cir. 2014).  The \nSixth Circuit has long recognized that the First Amendment does not make a university professor \n9 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 17 of 29  PAGEID #: 1885\n“a  sovereign  unto  himself”,  and  the  university  may  take  action  against  a  professor  whose \npedagogical attitude and teaching methods do not conform to institutional standards.  See Parate \nv. Isibor, 868 F.2d 821, 827 (6th Cir. 1989).  In Savage v. Gee, 665 F.3d 732 (6th Cir. 2012), the \nCourt rejected First Amendment arguments from a plaintiff who was the Head of Reference and \nLibrary Instruction at a public university about the choice of a book that would be assigned to all \nincoming first year students at a university.  Savage, 665 F.3d at 735.  The Court rejected an \nargument that his advocacy for a particular book was protected by the First Amendment as \n“academic scholarship”, holding that his speech was pursuant to his duties as Head of Reference \nand Library Instruction.  See id at 738.   \nMore broadly, Meriwether’s alleged “speech” does not relate to the rights of a public \nemployee to “participate in public affairs”.  See Connick v. Meyers, 461 U.S. 138, 144-45 (1983).  \nThe Garcetti Court distinguished the unprotected speech related to a public employee’s duties, \nfrom the classic example of protected speech of a letter to a newspaper by a school teacher in \nPickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968), “whose letter to the newspaper had no official \nsignificance and bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day.”  Garcetti, \n547 U.S. at 422.2  The First Amendment does not give public employees “a right to perform their \njobs  however  they  see  fit.”    Id.,  547  U.S.  at  422;  nor  does  the  First  Amendment \n“‘constitutionalize the employee grievance.’”  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 420, quoting Connick, 461 \nU.S. at 154.  Meriwether’s Amended Complaint is based upon specific classroom interactions, \nthe use of titles and pronouns to address a student, which the University has not only the right, \nbut a responsibility to manage under a plethora of workplace rules and regulations.   \n                                                 \n2 It is not necessary to reach the question of so-called Pickering balancing at this juncture of the \ncase, but the Defendants do not waive their right to assert this argument at another time.   \n10 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 18 of 29  PAGEID #: 1886\nThe written warning Meriwether challenges also fails to state any adverse employment \naction to support his First Amendment retaliation claim.  See Savage, 665 F.3d at 738; see also \nPoppy v. City of Willoughby Hills, 96 Fed. Appx. 292, 295 (6th Cir. 2004) (review of employee \ntime sheets, inspection of employee’s records did not adversely affect employment or deter \nplaintiff from exercising her First Amendment rights); Dennison v. Murray State Univ., 465 F. \nSupp. 2d 733, 747 (W.D. Ky. 2006) (decrease in office size and “antiquated” telephone not a \nmaterially adverse employment action in First Amendment retaliation case).  De minimis actions, \nincluding a state agency’s review of a plaintiff’s confidential files, do not constitute adverse \nactions that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in protected speech.  See \nWurzelbacher  v.  Jones-Kelley,  675  F.3d  580  (6th  Cir.  2012).    Neither  do  “an  employer’s \ncommencement of an investigation, [or] . . . criticisms, accusations, threats, or ‘bad mouthing’” \nconstitute adverse actions in First Amendment retaliation cases. Magley v. Wright, 2001 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 4612 at *19 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 30, 2001) (citations omitted); Hornbeak-Denton v. \nMyers, 361 Fed. Appx. 684, 688 (6th Cir. 2010)(in First Amendment retaliation case, finding that \n“[m]ere threats . . . are generally not sufficient to satisfy the adverse action requirement”) \n(quoting Mitchell v. Vanderbilt Univ., 389 F.3d 177, 182 (6th Cir. 2004)) (alterations in original).   \nBecause Meriwether’s “speech” was pursuant to his duties, and he did not suffer an \nadverse employment action, his First Amendment retaliation claim should be dismissed.   \n2.  Meriwether’s “Second Cause of Action” also fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted as it does not base a claim upon “speech” protected by \nthe  First  Amendment,  and  his  claim  of  “content”  or  “viewpoint \ndiscrimination” is without merit.   \n \nIn the second claim for relief, Meriwether alleges again that his “speech”, the use of a \ntitle and pronouns, is protected by the First Amendment, and that the “content” of his speech is \nsubject to “viewpoint discrimination” in violation of the Constitution.  Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. \n11 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 19 of 29  PAGEID #: 1887\n¶¶ 318.  As discussed above, this is “speech” about how to address students, which is not \nprotected under Garcetti.  The Amended Complaint only generally alleges the policies are \noverbroad,  that  is,  that  they  prohibit  a  substantial  amount  of  protected  speech,  see,  e.g., \nLeonardson v City of E. Lansing, 89 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1990).  The Amended Complaint \nfails to allege any protected speech that is captured by these policies, since it focuses only on \nMeriwether’s classroom interactions.  This overbreadth challenge is really a challenge to the \npolicy on its face, see, e.g., Speet v. Schuette, 726 F.3d 867, 872-73 (6th Cir. 2013), and fails to \nplausibly suggest that the policy is substantially overbroad, as required to state a claim for relief.  \nSee id., quoting City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987); New York v. Ferber, 458 \nU.S. 747, 769 (1982); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973).  In this context “substantial” \noverbreadth means that the policy prohibits a “substantial amount of protected speech both in an \nabsolute sense and relative to [the policy’s] plainly legitimate sweep[.]”  Speet, supra, quoting \nCarey v. Wolnitzek, 614 F.3d 189, 208 (6th Cir. 2010).  Meriwether relies only on his own \nmisunderstood interpretation of the First Amendment, and fails to state an overbreadth claim.   \n Meriwether  also  only  generally  alleges  that  the  University’s  policies  are \nunconstitutionally vague.  See Leonardson, supra; see also Dambrot v. Cent. Michigan Univ., 55 \nF.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir. 1995).  Meriwether generally alleges the policies grant University \nofficials  “unbridled  discretion”,  Doc.  #34,  Comp.  ¶  321.    The  documentation  attached  to \nMeriwether’s Amended Complaint shows that he was directed multiple times in how to address \nthe student and given an option that would treat the student equally, and he chose not to follow \nthose straightforward directives.  He understood the guidance he was given, he simply disagreed \nwith it and refused to follow it.  The University’s ultimate decision upholding the written \nwarning indicated that it was not imposed because of any inadvertent slip-up or mistake on \n12 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 20 of 29  PAGEID #: 1888\nMeriwether’s  part,  but  because  he  failed  to  stop  unfairly  singling  out  the  student  in  a \ndiscriminatory  manner.    The  “speech”  in  this  instance  occurred  during  Meriwether’s  class, \nduring  a  course  taught  pursuant  to  University  curriculum  requirements,  in  a  University \nclassroom,  and  by  a  Professor  who  was  compensated  by  the  University  and  has  been  an \nemployee of the University for over 20 years.  Meriwether has not plausibly alleged that he was \never subject to potential discipline for conduct that occurred outside the University, and even if \nhe did, a nexus could exist that would allow for the University to reasonably direct him to cease \ndiscriminatory conduct towards a student.  See, e.g., Piggee v. Carl Sandburg College, 464 F.3d \n667 (7th Cir. 2006).   \nMeriwether’s  lawsuit  is  a  similar  attempt  to  challenge  conduct-related  policies, \nprohibiting discriminatory conduct and harassing conduct, under a superficial First Amendment \nanalysis.    The  same  arguments  made  here  could  be  made  regarding  policies  on  equal \nemployment  opportunities,  non-discrimination  and  discriminatory  harassment  for  every \nemployer in the United States who complies with Title IX for institutions of higher education, \nand  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  and  various  other  federal  and  state  non-\ndiscrimination laws.  The vagueness and overbreadth doctrines are prudential doctrines, which \nare only relied upon by courts to strike down statutes (or policies) “as a last resort.”  See Staley v. \nJones, 239 F.3d 769, 776-77 (6th Cir. 2001)(quoting Broadrick v. U.S., 413 U.S. 601, 613 \n(1973)).  “Sustaining a facial attack to the constitutionality of a state law … is momentous and \nconsequential.  It is an ‘exceptional remedy.’”  Speet, supra, quoting Carey v Wolnitzek, 614 \nF.3d  189,  201  (6th  Cir.  2010).    Meriwether’s  difference  of  opinion  with  the  University’s \nadministration does not a constitutional claim make.   \n3.  Meriwether’s “Third Cause of Action” for “compelled speech” also should be \ndismissed.   \n13 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 21 of 29  PAGEID #: 1889\n \nIn his third cause of action, Meriwether does not state a claim for “compelled speech” for \nsimilar  reasons  cited  in  the  arguments  above,  based  above  all  on  Garcetti.    Neither  has \nMeriwether stated a claim for First Amendment retaliation, because he has not suffered an \nactionable injury, or “adverse employment action” under Savage v. Gee, supra.  On this claim of \n“compelled  speech”,  Meriwether’s  argument  is  particularly  weak,  since  he  was  offered  an \nalternative by the Dean on multiple occasions to simply stop using all articles/titles (i.e. “Mr.” or \n“Ms.”) when he addressed students in his class, and he rejected this option.  See Doc. #34, \nAmend. Comp. ¶¶ 153-55, and Exhibit 17, Dean’s Letter of May 29, 2018.   \n4.  Meriwether’s “Fourth Cause of Action” for violation of his rights to freely \nexercise his religion should be dismissed. \n \nIn the constitutional context, only a law that is not neutral or of general applicability \n“must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to \nadvance that interest.”  See Doe v. Cong. of the United States, 891 F.3d 578, 591 (6th Cir. 2018) \n(free exercise challenge asserting that U.S. currency use of the motto “In God We Trust” motto \npromotes Christian monotheistic message), quoting Church of the Lukumi Bablu Aye, Inc. v. City \nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531-32 (1993).  The nondiscrimination policies challenged by this \nlawsuit are part of the University’s obligations under Title IX and Title VII, and fall into this \ncategory of neutral rules of general applicability.  The Supreme Court has held that “neutral, \ngenerally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of religion usually do not violate \nthe Free Exercise Clause[.]” Doe, 891 F.3d at 591, quoting Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 859 \n(2015)(citing Emp’t Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-82 \n(1990)).  The nondiscrimination policy challenged here is neutral, based on federal and state laws \nprohibiting  discrimination,  and  does  not  fall  within  precedents  requiring  a  “compelling” \n14 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 22 of 29  PAGEID #: 1890\ngovernmental interest or that need be “narrowly tailored.”  A law, or the nondiscrimination \npolicies challenged in this case, is not neutral “if the object of [the] law is to infringe upon or \nrestrict practices because of their religious motivation,” or if the “purpose of [the] law is the \nsuppression of religion or religious conduct.”  Doe, 891 F.3d at 591, quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at \n533.  Meriwether does not, and cannot, point to any language in these policies that suppresses the \nChristian religion or religious practices.   \nNeither does the Amended Complaint state a claim for some “as applied” challenge to the \nimplementation of the policies in this case.  His Amended Complaint states that he was first \nnotified by his Union of the non-discrimination policy, and its applicability in the transgender \ncontext, back in August 2016.  See Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶¶ 106-07.  He received written \nguidance from the Dean, had a fair and undisputed investigation, and received a written warning \nthat he could and did challenge through his union.  The policy is neutral on its face, and, given \nthe straightforward, undisputed nature of the conduct he admits, his attempts to cast this as \nprejudiced against his Christian beliefs ignores the neutral, general applicability of the policy.  \nThat same general directive was enforced throughout.   \n5.  Meriwether’s “Fifth Cause of Action” for being subject to “unconstitutional \nconditions” should be dismissed.   \n \nIn his “Fifth Cause of Action”, Meriwether baselessly contends that his “status as a \nprofessor  in  good  standing  at  the  University”  and  his  employment  at  the  University,  are \njeopardized by the “unconstitutional condition” the University has placed on him in violation of \nhis First Amendment rights.  Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. ¶ 343.  He alleges that his “receipt of \nstate  benefits”  (i.e.,  his  employment  and  salary)  is  threatened  unless  he  “surrenders”  his \n“constitutionally protected rights to freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, due process, and \nequal protection.”  See id., ¶¶ 344-46.  This claim essentially restates a First Amendment claim, \n15 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 23 of 29  PAGEID #: 1891\nand should be dismissed.  The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized and applied a form of the \n“unconstitutional  conditions”  doctrine  in  public  employment  cases  involving  the  First \nAmendment and “political patronage” challenges.  See, e.g., O’Hare Truck Serv. v. City of \nNorthlake,  518  U.S.  712,  716-17  (1996);  Elrod  v.  Burns,  427  U.S.  347  (1976);  see,  also, \nMcCloud v. Testa, 97 F.3d 1536, 1550-51 (6th Cir. 1996).  Notably, Meriwether remains a faculty \nmember with full tenure rights.  The only adverse action he challenges here is the written \nwarning, and the only act he challenges is the manner in which he addresses the student in his \nclassroom, including references to “titles” and “pronouns”.  As discussed above, the ministerial \nact  of  referring  to  a  student  as  “Ms.”  or  “she”  or  by  no  sex  identifier  at  all  is  not  First \nAmendment protected speech.  Since this claim is derivative of his First Amendment claims, it \nshould also be dismissed.   \n6.   Meriwether’s “Sixth Cause of Action” and Due Process Claim(s) that the \nUniversity’s  non-discrimination  policies  are  “overbroad”  or  “vague”  are \nwithout merit and should be dismissed.    \n \nAlso without merit is Meriwether’s overlapping Sixth “Cause of Action” that the non-\ndiscrimination  policies  of  the  University  are  unconstitutionally  overbroad  or  vague  and \n“encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech” and that his “expression \nregarding gender identity is protected by the First Amendment.” See Doc. #34, Amend. Comp.  \n¶¶ 350-51.  The simple act of the use of a title or a pronoun during a class discussion is not First \nAmendment protected speech, based on Garcetti, supra.  As discussed above in III.B.2., in \ndetermining whether a policy is unconstitutionally overbroad, the Court first looks at whether \n“the regulation reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.”  Leonardson v \nCity of E. Lansing, 89 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir. 1990).  Meriwether’s argument fails on this point, \nas he only points to his own, unprotected speech to support his claims.  Only a policy that is \n16 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 24 of 29  PAGEID #: 1892\n“substantially overbroad” fails on its face.  See Speet v. Schuette, 726 F.3d 867, 872-73 (6th Cir. \n2013), citing City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987); New York v. Ferber, 458 \nU.S. 747, 769 (1982); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973); Carey v. Wolnitzek, 614 \nF.3d 189, 208 (6th Cir. 2010).  Since Meriwether’s lawsuit relies only on his own misunderstood \ninterpretation of the First Amendment, he fails to state a claim that the policy is overbroad.   \nAs in Section III.B.2 of this Motion, there is also no claim here that the University’s \npolicies  are  unconstitutionally  vague.    See  Leonardson,  supra;  see  also  Dambrot  v.  Cent. \nMichigan Univ., 55 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir. 1995).  The conclusory argument that the \npolicies  are  “unconstitutionally  vague  because  they  grant  University  officials  unbridled \ndiscretion in deciding what constitutes ‘gender identity’ and ‘gender identity discrimination’”, \nDoc. #34, Comp. ¶ 354, is belied by the attachments to Meriwether’s filing.  He was directed \nmultiple times on how to address the student, and he chose to ignore that direction.  The Court \nshould  disregard  the  hypotheticals  and  speculation  Meriwether  invites,  because  he  has  not \nplausibly alleged any such confusion occurred under the University’s policies or practices.  See \nDoc. #34, ¶ 74 (referring to an “infinite” number of possible pronouns based on the Univ. of \nCal., Davis LGBTQIA Res. Ctr., which is not at issue in this case).   This is not a vagueness case \nwhere a Plaintiff can allege the policies either (1) deny fair notice of the standard of conduct \napplicable;  or  (2)  constitute  “an  unrestricted  delegation  of  power,”  inviting  “arbitrary, \ndiscriminatory and overzealous enforcement.”  See, e.g., Leonardson, 896 F.2d at 196, quoting \nWashington Mobilization Committee v. Cullinane, 566 F.2d 107, (D.C. Cir. 1977).  Meriwether \nwas notified by his Union of these standards in August 2016, and had multiple interactions with \nhis Dean and Department Chair on the issue.  After a formal investigation, he was given only a \nwritten warning, which is not even an adverse action under well-established First Amendment \n17 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 25 of 29  PAGEID #: 1893\ncase law, and he was afforded the opportunity to challenge the action through his Union and the \nUnion’s grievance process, which he began but abandoned for unknown reasons.   \n7.   Meriwether’s “Seventh Cause of Action” for violation of his rights to Equal \nProtection under the Fourteenth Amendment does not state a claim based \nupon a suspect classification or fundamental right, and should be dismissed.   \n \nMeriwether’s “Seventh Cause of Action” also misunderstands a claim under the Equal \nProtection clause, and should be dismissed.  The Equal Protection Clause “protects against \narbitrary classifications, and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally.”  Jackson \nv. Jamrog, 411 F.3d 615, 618 (6th Cir. 2005).  Although the lawsuit generally alleges that \nProfessor Meriwether is “similarly situated to other professors at the University”, he alleges \ndisparate treatment based upon his refusal to “endorse” concepts of “gender identity.”  Doc. #34, \n¶¶ 358-59.  His claim essentially restates his varied First Amendment claims which, as has been \ndiscussed above, are not based upon “speech” protected by the First Amendment.  Essentially, \nthe Amended Complaint alleges an archaic “class of one” theory of the Equal Protection Clause \nthat  has  been  dismissed  by  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court.    See  Engquist  v.  Oregon  Dept.  of \nAgriculture, 553 U.S. 591, 598 (2008) (“[T]he class of one theory of equal protection does not \napply in the public employment context.”).  Meriwether’s claim is based on his conduct in the \nclassroom, and that is his only argument for a denial of equal protection; it is not based upon any \nrecognized theory of an “arbitrary classification” under the Equal Protection clause.  \n8.   Meriwether’s Eighth Cause of Action for his “Rights of Conscience and Free \nExercise of Religion” under the Ohio Constitution’s Art. I, § 7, should be \ndismissed, either based on sovereign immunity grounds, or for prudential \nreasons.   \n \nAs discussed above, the Defendants contend that Meriwether’s claims under the U.S. \nConstitution are all without merit and should be dismissed.  Any state law claims against the \nDefendants  should  be  dismissed  as  not  within  this  Court’s  jurisdiction.    Shawnee  State \n18 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 26 of 29  PAGEID #: 1894\nUniversity is a public institution and “instrumentality of the state” of Ohio.  See, e.g., O.R.C. §§ \n3362.01 et seq.  Setting aside whether Meriwether’s claims have any merit, his state law claims \nare barred in this Court by sovereign immunity as interpreted under the Eleventh Amendment.  \nSee, e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 120-21 (1984); see also \nVIBO  Corp.,  Inc.  v.  Conway,  et  al.,  669  F.3d  675,  691  (6th  Cir.  2012).    “[T]he  Eleventh \nAmendment bars suits for money damages or injunctive relief against SSU [Shawnee State \nUniversity]…”  Reeves v. Shawnee State Univ., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29764 (S.D. Ohio March \n2, 2017)(Dlott, J.).  The State of Ohio has not waived its sovereign immunity by consenting to \nfederal courts’ jurisdiction over claims against the State of Ohio.  See, e.g., Manning v. Ohio \nState Library Bd., 62 Ohio St. 3d 24 (1991); Leaman v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Retardation & \nDevelopmental Disabilities, 825 F.2d 946, 954 (6th Cir. 1987) (en banc).  Rather, Ohio has \nwaived its sovereign immunity only as to actions filed in the Court of Claims of Ohio.  O.R.C. § \n2743.02; see also O.R.C. § 2743.03(A)(2). \nAlternatively, absent the jurisdictional argument, if Meriwether seeks to assert that the \nOhio Constitution has protections that are broader or different than the U.S. Constitution, this \nCourt should not, in the first instance, serve as a forum to so interpret Ohio’s constitutional \nprotections.  The Court should abstain from hearing any claim for a different interpretation or \nnovel  extension  of  Ohio’s  constitution  under  doctrines,  such  as  Burford  abstention,  which \nrecognize that federal courts will not interpret difficult questions of state law in the first instance \nor where the exercise of federal review would be disruptive to state efforts to establish a coherent \npolicy.  See New Orleans Pub. Serv. Inc. v. New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989)(internal \nquotations omitted).  Assuming Meriwether seeks to proceed with this state constitutional claim \nindependently of his other federal claims, Meriwether would be seeking to invoke Ohio’s state \n19 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 27 of 29  PAGEID #: 1895\nconstitution to invalidate a nondiscrimination policy the University is obliged to use to comply \nwith federal law.  This claim should be dismissed.   \n9.   Meriwether’s “Ninth Cause of Action” for “Breach of Contract” should be \ndismissed, either on sovereign immunity grounds or because the collective \nbargaining agreement with the University is enforced exclusively through a \ngrievance process that results in final and binding arbitration.   \n \n  Plaintiff’s “breach of contract” claim does not state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  As discussed above in III.B.8., Meriwether’s state law claims are not in this Court’s \njurisdiction, and barred by sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman,  465  U.S.  89,  120-21  (1984).    Under  Ohio  law,  courts  are  generally  without \njurisdiction to entertain contractual disputes under R.C. Chapter 4117.  See, e.g., State ex rel. \nWilkinson  v.  Reed,  99  Ohio  St.3d  106  (2003).    R.C.  §  4117.10(A)  provides,  that,  “If  the \nagreement  provides  for  a  final  and  binding  arbitration  of  grievances,  public  employers, \nemployees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that grievance procedure….”  The \nR.C. 4117 collective bargaining agreement here contains an Article on “Grievance Procedures” \nthat culminates in binding arbitration.  See Doc. #34, Amend. Comp. Ex. 4, Art. 19, pp. 107-110.    \nEmployees whose terms and conditions of employment are covered by a collective bargaining \nagreement that provides for binding arbitration must follow that procedure, except to the limited \nextent that the agreement explicitly provides to the contrary.  See Leon v. Boardman Twp., 100 \nOhio St.3d 335, 340 (¶ 17) (2003); see also, Null v. Ohio Dep’t of Mental Retardation & \nDevelopmental Disabilities, 137 Ohio App.3d 152 (Franklin Ct. App. 2000); Brannen v. Kings \nLocal Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ., 144 Ohio App. 3d 620, 628 (Ohio Ct. App. Warren 2001).  \nConsequently, Meriwether’s “breach of contract” claim fails to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted; the language of the agreement is enforced through that agreement’s grievance \nprocedure and arbitration, not through some “breach of contract” lawsuit.  \n20 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 36 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 28 of 29  PAGEID #: 1896\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants submit that this Motion to Dismiss is well-taken \nand respectfully request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, and this \nlawsuit, in its entirety as a matter of law.     \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST (0056290) \nOhio Attorney General \n \n/s/ Rory P.

Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1464, ¶ 53.  Shawnee enforces \nwritten nondiscrimination policies that apply to all Shawnee employees.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1464-1465, ¶¶ 55, 61; Am. Compl. Ex. 1, Doc. 34-1, at PageID 1509-1510; Am. Compl. \nEx. 2, Doc. 34-2, at PageID 1511-1512.  Among other policies, Shawnee prohibits “Sex and \nGender Based Discrimination,” including “adverse treatment on based on . . . gender identity,” \nwhich is defined as treatment that “denies or limits [an] individual’s ability to obtain the benefits \nof Shawnee State’s programs or activities.” Am.

In 2016, \nPlaintiff received guidance that, in order to comply with Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policies \nand its obligations under Title IX, employees must treat transgender students equally, including \naddressing transgender students in accord with the student’s gender identity, and that failure to do \nso could result in discipline.

Am.

Am.  Compl.,  Doc.  34,  at \nPageID 1474, ¶ 127 (noting that “participation component of the course” requires students to be \n“prepared to give his or her answers to the assigned study questions when called upon to do so”). \nPlaintiff’s refusal to comply with Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policies in his treatment of \nMs. Doe ultimately led to formal disciplinary proceedings.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1485-\n1486, ¶¶ 233, 239.  Plaintiff was issued a written warning, and advised to comply with Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policies when addressing students.  Am.

Plaintiff then filed a union grievance against Shawnee, which was denied, Am. \nCompl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1489, ¶ 264, and this lawsuit followed. \nARGUMENT \nShawnee’s nondiscrimination policies require that when its employees address a student, \nthey respect the student’s gender identity.  The policy applies to all employees, regardless of \nwhether they are professors or not.  The policy does not apply to an employee’s scholarship nor \ndoes it limit any employee’s freedom to express views on any subject or to teach any subject.  \nPlaintiff may disagree with this workplace policy, but it does not violate the Constitution.  A public \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff did subsequently refer to Ms. Doe as “Mr.” Doe in at least one later class period, but alleges this was \n“inadvertent[].”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1477-1478, ¶ 165. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 4 of 23  PAGEID #: 1901\nemployer, like a private employer, may insist that its employees adhere to a nondiscrimination \npolicy when undertaking their job-related duties. \nI.  Plaintiff Has Not Stated a Claim Under the Free Speech Clause. \n \nPlaintiff brings four free-speech claims: “Retaliation” (Count One), “Content & Viewpoint \nDiscrimination”  (Count  Two),  “Compelled  Speech”  (Count  Three),  and  “Unconstitutional \nConditions” (Count Five).  Each claim boils down to the same theory: the Free Speech Clause \nprevents Shawnee from requiring him to use female pronouns when addressing Ms. Doe.   \nThese claims fail for three independent reasons.  First, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. \n410 (2006), Shawnee does not violate the Free Speech Clause by requiring its employees to adhere \nto workplace policies when acting in their capacity as employees.  That rule forecloses Plaintiff’s \nfree-speech claim: his in-classroom speech while teaching Shawnee students plainly occurs in his \ncapacity as an employee.  Second, even for speech made as a citizen rather than an employee, the \nFirst Amendment protects public employees’ speech only when it addresses a matter of “public \nconcern.”  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 (1983).  The only speech at issue here—which is \nsolely about how to address a particular student—falls far short of meeting the “public concern” \nrequirement.  Third, even if Plaintiff’s speech were on an issue of public concern, the First \nAmendment would permit Shawnee to establish and enforce a nondiscrimination policy to ensure \nthat its transgender students have an equal opportunity to get a university education. \nA.  Plaintiff Cannot Base a First Amendment Claim on Speech Made Pursuant to His \nOfficial Duties.  \n \n1.  A State Employer May Require Its Employee to Adhere to Workplace Rules, Including \nThose That Affect Work-Related Speech. \n \nPlaintiff’s free-speech claims are precluded by Garcetti.  In Garcetti, the Supreme Court \nheld that “when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 5 of 23  PAGEID #: 1902\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate \ntheir communications from employer discipline.”  Id. at 421.  Garcetti is controlling here, where \nPlaintiff’s in-class speech referring to a particular student falls squarely within “statements [made] \npursuant to [his] official duties” as a Shawnee employee.  Id.  Plaintiff alleges that he “regularly \ncalls on students to answer questions about the assigned readings and to participate in class \ndiscussions.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 126.  “To him, using the Socratic method \nof instruction is fundamental to teaching philosophy.”  Id.  Plaintiff’s use of male pronouns in \naddressing Ms. Doe, which led to this dispute, occurred in connection with one such Socratic \ndialogue.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 128.  Thus, Plaintiff’s speech was made in \nclass, in his capacity as a professor.  Under Garcetti, that resolves this case.  When, as here, an \nemployee is “simply performing his or her job duties,” there is “no warrant” for a “delicate \nbalancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences.”  Garcetti, 547 \nU.S. at 423.  Plaintiff’s status as facilitator of classroom discussions “owe[d] its existence to \n[Plaintiff’s]  professional  responsibilities,”  and  therefore  Shawnee’s  enforcement  of  a \nnondiscrimination code placing certain limits on that interaction “does not infringe any liberties \nthe employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.”  Id. at 421-22; see also id. at 422 (the First \nAmendment does not give public employees “a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.”). \nGarcetti’s holding that the First Amendment does not generally exempt public employees \nfrom having to comply with rules about workplace conduct and speech is particularly compelling \nhere, where Plaintiff exercised authority over Jane Doe as a direct result of his official position as \na Shawnee employee.  To be clear, Garcetti applies even when an employee is not exercising such \nauthority—for  instance,  in  Garcetti  itself,  the  plaintiff  was  a  whistleblower,  writing  a \nmemorandum to get his supervisor’s attention.  Here, however, Plaintiff is exercising authority—\n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 6 of 23  PAGEID #: 1903\nmaking his claim for immunity from workplace rules even weaker.  In his capacity as professor, \nPlaintiff decides which students may speak, what questions they must answer, and how the \nstudent’s participation will affect the student’s grade.  Public institutions that confer authority are \nentitled to regulate the exercise of that authority, including to ensure that students are treated fairly \nand respectfully and are able to participate in and benefit from their courses.  Shawnee employs \nPlaintiff as a professor and grants the authority to call upon students in class and to grade them on \ntheir classroom participation.  The Free Speech Clause does not give Plaintiff a right to exercise \nthat authority on behalf of the university in whatever manner he sees fit. \n2.  Plaintiff’s Role as a Professor Does Not Exempt Him from Garcetti or Shawnee’s \nNondiscrimination Policies. \n \nPlaintiff’s contention that he is exempt from Garcetti because he is a professor has no \nmerit.  As the Sixth Circuit has explained, public universities may require professors to adhere to \nuniversity policies regarding in-class instruction without running afoul of the First Amendment.  \n“Academic freedom implicates the freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to \neducation, requiring deference to a university’s academic decisions.”  Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of \nEduc. of Tipp City Exempted Vill. Sch. Dist., 624 F.3d 332, 344 (6th Cir. 2010).  “In the context \nof in-class curricular speech,” even “in the university arena,” “a teacher’s invocation of academic \nfreedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an educational institution’s decisions.”  Id. \n(citations and quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, a school may go as far as to dismiss a professor \nbased on a professor’s teaching methods without implicating the First Amendment.  See id. (a \nschool “may constitutionally choose not to renew the contract of a nontenured professor when that \nprofessor’s pedagogical attitude and teaching methods do not conform to institutional standards”). \nHere, Shawnee is merely requiring that Plaintiff use honorifics consistent with students’ \ngender identity while interacting with them, if he chooses to refer to his students using honorifics.  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 7 of 23  PAGEID #: 1904\nThis requirement applies identically to him as it does to every other Shawnee employee, see Am. \nCompl. Ex. 2, Doc. 34-2, at PageID 1512, and to all official-capacity interactions, not just \nclassroom interactions, see Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1472, ¶ 108.  Plaintiff alleges that \nreferring to Ms. Doe with female pronouns violates Plaintiff’s “sincerely held religious beliefs as \na Christian . . . related to gender identity,” id., at PageID 1482, ¶ 208, but these allegations are \nunrelated to his status as a professor.  Campus police officers, secretaries, and custodians may have \nequally sincere religious objections to referring to students consistent with their gender identity, \nyet Plaintiff does not appear to dispute that under Garcetti, Shawnee can require those employees, \nwhile on the job, to adhere to its nondiscrimination policy.  That Plaintiff is a professor does not \nentitle him to an exemption from Shawnee’s requirement that employees refrain from treating \nstudents unequally on the basis of their gender identity, including when addressing students in \nclass.   \nPlaintiff characterizes Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policy  as an attack on academic \nfreedom, as though Shawnee were seeking to censor his scholarship or freedom to express any \nviews he wishes on gender, transgender issues, or anything else.  E.g., Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1481, ¶¶ 202, 204.  But the Complaint alleges no facts that support that assertion.  While \nPlaintiff’s  course  may  be  related  to  “ethics  and  human  nature,”  Am.  Compl.,  Doc.  34,  at \nPageID 1481, ¶ 202, Plaintiff does not allege that Shawnee has required him to voice, or refrain \nfrom voicing, any positions or views on those topics.  Being required to refer to transgender \nstudents in a manner consistent with students’ gender identity in order to ensure that all students \nare able to participate in and benefit from their courses does not infringe upon Plaintiff’s scholarly \nfreedom, any more than similar rules requiring professors to hold classes on time, post office hours, \nor avoid subjecting students to harassing speech or behavior.  See, e.g., Johnson Kurek v. Abu-\n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 8 of 23  PAGEID #: 1905\nAbsi, 423 F.3d 590, 595 (6th Cir. 2005) (“While the First Amendment may protect Johnson-\nKurek’s right to express her ideas about pedagogy, it does not require that the university permit \nher to teach her classes in accordance with those ideas.  The freedom of a university to decide what \nmay be taught and how it shall be taught would be meaningless if a professor were entitled to \nrefuse to comply with university requirements whenever they conflict with his or her teaching \nphilosophy.”). \nPlaintiff cannot characterize this as an academic freedom case merely by alleging that \nuttering “Ms. Doe” implicitly conveys his views about gender.  Shawnee’s policy does not restrict \nPlaintiff’s freedom to write scholarly articles about gender or to teach his philosophical views \nabout gender or anything else.  Plaintiff cannot credibly claim that there is any scholarly interest \nin disclosing his views about the gender of a particular student as male or female.  Complying with \nShawnee’s policy does not affect the content of his instruction; it merely requires Plaintiff—while \nexercising his university-conferred authority—to treat transgender students in accord with their \ngender  identity.    Academic  freedom  does  not  preclude  a  public  university  from  requiring \nprofessors to adhere to basic norms of civil behavior.  See Savage v. Gee, 665 F.3d 732, 739 (6th \nCir. 2012) (speech that “was only loosely, if at all, related to academic scholarship . . . does not \nfall within the realm of speech that might fall outside of Garcetti’s reach”). \nPlaintiff’s  amended  complaint  adds  allegations  that  he  has  “assiduously  avoided” \ndiscussing issues related to gender identity in his classes as a result of the warning he received.  \nAm. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1492, ¶ 296.  Plaintiff now speculates that “any further complaint \nregarding how he communicates on issues related to gender identity” could result in further \ndisciplinary actions.  Id. at PageID 1492, ¶ 290.  These allegations cannot save his free speech \nclaim.  Plaintiff offers no allegations, and his many exhibits do not remotely suggest, that anyone \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 9 of 23  PAGEID #: 1906\nat Shawnee ever tried to prevent Plaintiff from writing or speaking about gender identity.  To the \ncontrary, as Plaintiff himself alleges, Shawnee merely required him to “refer to students using titles \nand pronouns that reflect each student’s self-asserted gender identity.”  Id. at PageID 1477, ¶ 164.  \nTo the extent Plaintiff declines to include topics related to transgender issues on his syllabus, that \nis his personal choice and presents no First Amendment concern.  In any event, Sixth Circuit \nprecedent establishes that the First Amendment does not confer upon professors the right to teach \nthe syllabus of their choosing over a university’s objection.  See Evans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 344 \n(because “[i]t is the educational institution that has a right to academic freedom, not the individual \nteacher,” “a teacher’s invocation of academic freedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an \neducational institution’s decisions” (quotation marks omitted)). \nAccepting Plaintiff’s position would have far-reaching implications.  For instance, a \nprofessor who believes that women should not be pursuing higher education could refuse to call \nupon them in class, or call men by their surnames and refer to all women by their first names or \nsimply as “woman.”  A professor who believes that married women must be subservient to their \nhusbands could insist on calling all married women by their husband’s surnames even if they have \nnot changed their surnames after marriage.  And he could declare that the college is powerless to \nstop him because such statements “communicate[] his own views on these subjects.”  Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1481, ¶ 204.  Likewise, a professor hostile to a student’s religion could refuse \nto use names associated with a particular religion or even refer to the student as a “heathen” in \nclass—and declare that the Constitution affords him the right to do so because he personally \nbelieves the student to be a heathen.  The Constitution does not require that college classrooms be \nfree from evenhanded applications of nondiscrimination policies that simply seek to ensure that \nall students are able to participate in and benefit from their courses.   \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 10 of 23  PAGEID #: 1907\nB.  Plaintiff’s Speech Was on a Matter of Private Concern. \n \nPlaintiff’s claims also fail because referring to a student in order to call upon her in class \nto answer a question or contribute to the class discussion is not speaking on a “matter[] of public \nconcern.”  Mayhew v. Town of Smyrna, 856 F.3d 456, 462 (6th Cir. 2017).  As such, Shawnee may \nrespond to that speech without “intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First \nAmendment.”  Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. \nSpeech addresses a matter of public concern if it relates to a “matter of political, social, or \nother concern to the community, or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject \nof general interest and of value and concern to the public.”  Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 241 \n(2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “Whether an employee’s speech addresses \na matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given \nstatement, as revealed by the whole record.”  Connick, 461 U.S. at 147–48.  \nThis is a paradigmatic case of speech on a matter of private concern.  Plaintiff’s speech \nexclusively involves workplace interactions.  It is directed to one person for the limited purpose \nof informing Ms. Doe that she is being called upon to answer a question—not to express the \nprofessor’s views on a particular group of people or on anything else.  See Am. Compl., Doc. 34, \nat PageID 1480, ¶¶ 193-195 (alleging that “potential violation” of nondiscrimination policy \ninvolved only Plaintiff’s matter of addressing Ms. Doe individually).  It is no more a “matter of \npublic concern” than any other situation in which a public employee addresses a member of the \npublic in the course of the employee’s official duties.   \nPlaintiff insists that the reason he referred to Ms. Doe with a male pronoun is that he holds \npersonal views on an issue of public concern.  But Plaintiff misunderstands the “public concern” \ntest.  The purpose of that test is to encourage discourse on “issues about which information is \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 11 of 23  PAGEID #: 1908\nneeded or appropriate to enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the \noperation of their government.”  Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, 590 (6th Cir. 2004).  Thus, whether \nspeech is on a matter of “public concern” turns on the information that the speech imparts—which \nrequires an analysis of what was said, rather than the internal motivations of the speaker.  See id. \nat 591 (“the pertinent question is not why the employee spoke, but what he said,” and the argument \nthat “subjective motivations are dispositive when determining whether . . . speech addresses a \nmatter of purely personal concern is in direct conflict with the Supreme Court’s holding in \nConnick” (citation omitted)).  Thus, a letter to the editor denouncing corruption in government is \nof “public concern” even if the writer’s subjective motivation is to advance his or her career.  See, \ne.g., Westmoreland v. Sutherland, 662 F.3d 714, 719 (6th Cir. 2011) (statements about public \nsafety were on matters of public concern, even if motivated by plaintiff’s own financial losses); \nRodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 600 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Although Plaintiff’s underlying motive in \nwriting the memo might have been to complain about incompetent management, our duty is not to \ndiscern her underlying motive, but rather to evaluate her point as it is presented in the speech.”).  \nConversely, a statement of private concern is not transformed into a statement of public concern \neven if it is motivated by broader public considerations.  See, e.g., Nair v. Oakland Cnty. Cmty. \nMental Health Auth., 443 F.3d 469, 479-80 (6th Cir. 2006) (subjective motivations for authoring \nletter were irrelevant when letter itself did not touch on issue of public concern). \nThus, the Court must analyze not Plaintiff’s personal motives for using male honorifics or \ncalling Ms. Doe by her last name only, but the utterances themselves—i.e., his referring to Ms. \nDoe as “Mr. Doe” or “Doe.”  And they do not address a matter of public concern.2  They tell Ms. \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff’s amended complaint adds the conclusory allegation that his “comments about gender identity . . . address \nmatters of public concern.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1481, ¶ 202.  But Plaintiff cannot use this allegation to \novercome a motion to dismiss, because “[w]hether or not a plaintiff’s speech touches on a matter of public concern \nis a question of law.”  Handy-Clay v. City of Memphis, 695 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2012). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 12 of 23  PAGEID #: 1909\nDoe a question is coming.  That Plaintiff possesses personal opinions on broader social questions \nthat, if conveyed, might be of “public concern” does not transform his routine honorifics into \nstatements that “enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the operation of \ntheir government.”  Farhat, 370 F.3d at 590.  Indeed Plaintiff’s use of pronouns did not convey \nany information of public concern—even his own beliefs about gender—because a reasonable \nlistener would understand the use of female pronouns to reflect nothing more than the ordinary \ncivility that would be expected in any interaction between a professor and a student.  See, e.g., \nR.G. & G.R., 884 F.3d at 566 n.1 (“We refer to Stephens using female pronouns, in accordance \nwith the preference she has expressed through her briefing to this court.”).   \nPlaintiff’s manner of addressing Ms. Doe conveys one additional piece of information: it \n“outs” Ms. Doe as a transgender woman.  This further confirms that his statement is not on a matter \nof “public concern.”  Whether a person is transgender is the antithesis of information of “public \nconcern”—it is intensely private, personal information, as the Court acknowledged in its Order \ngranting Ms. Doe’s motion to proceed pseudonymously.  Order, Doc. 32 at PageID 1081-1082.  \nThere is a fundamental difference between gender as a general matter—a matter of public \nconcern—and a particular person’s status as transgender—a matter of private concern.  Conveying \nthe latter information does not transform Plaintiff’s speech into information of public concern \nmerely because the speaker is motivated by opinions about gender, any more than publicly \ndisclosing a specific person’s cancer diagnosis is a matter of “public concern” because the speaker \nintends to educate the public that cancer diagnoses are widespread. \nIf Plaintiff’s argument were correct, then public employees could convert any refusal to \ncomply with a workplace policy into speech on a matter of public concern simply by claiming that \ntheir violation is intended to “send a message” about some broader issue.  For example, a professor \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 13 of 23  PAGEID #: 1910\nwho believes that second marriages are sinful could claim a free-speech right to refuse to use a \nstudent’s married name in order to convey that belief.  Or a professor who believes that a particular \nreligion or nationality is “a lie” could claim a free speech right to convey that belief by refusing to \nrefer to a student by a name that signals adherence to that religion or nationality.  Neither the Sixth \nCircuit nor any other court has adopted such extreme reasoning. \nC.  Even Under First Amendment Balancing, Plaintiff’s Claim Fails. \n \nEven if Plaintiff were speaking as a citizen rather than as an employee, and his statements \nwere on a matter of public concern, his Free Speech claim would fail.  Plaintiff’s “interests . . . in \ncommenting upon matters of public concern” do not outweigh “the interest of the State, as an \nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.”  \nEvans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 338 (quoting Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High Sch. Dist. 205, \n391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)).  Here, Shawnee’s interest in maintaining its nondiscrimination policy \noutweighs Plaintiff’s interest in addressing Ms. Doe using particular honorifics. \nShawnee has a powerful interest in maintaining its nondiscrimination policy.  Colleges are \n“legally required to maintain a hostile-free learning environment and must strive to create policies \nwhich serve that purpose,” and have every right to protect their students’ “right to learn in a \nhostil[ity]-free environment.”  Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 823-24 (6th Cir. 2001).  “Speech \nthat rises to the level of harassment—whether based on sex, race, ethnicity, or other invidious \npremise—and which creates a hostile learning environment that ultimately thwarts the academic \nprocess, is speech that a learning institution has a strong interest in preventing.”  Id. at 824.   \nIn this case, Title IX3 requires Shawnee to maintain a nondiscrimination policy that ensures \nthat transgender students are treated in accordance with their gender identity.  Title IX provides \n                                                 \n3 Because Shawnee is a public institution, the Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits discrimination against Jane \nDoe on account of her gender identity.  See City of Salem, 378 F.3d at 577; Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316–\n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 14 of 23  PAGEID #: 1911\nthat “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  A university violates Title IX when \nits officials in positions of authority “had actual notice of, and [were] deliberately indifferent to, \nthe misconduct.”  Mallory v. Ohio Univ., 76 F. App’x 634, 638 (6th Cir. 2003); Sahm v. Miami \nUniv., 110 F. Supp. 3d 774, 778 (S.D. Ohio 2015).  Shawnee would be liable under that standard \nif it knowingly allowed its employees to discriminate against transgender students. \nThe  Sixth  Circuit  has  held  that  discrimination  against  transgender  individuals  is \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” for Title VII purposes.  EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral \nHomes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560, 571 (6th Cir. 2018) (“discrimination on the basis of transgender and \ntransitioning status violates Title VII.”).  Title IX similarly prohibits discrimination “on the basis \nof sex,” so discrimination against transgender individuals violates Title IX as well.  See Miles v. \nN.Y. Univ., 979 F. Supp. 248, 250 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (“[T]he Title IX term ‘on the basis of sex’ \nis interpreted in the same manner as similar language in Title VII”); see also Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1049 (7th Cir. 2017) (school policy that \n“punishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance . . . violates Title IX”).  Shawnee \nhas a compelling interest in complying with federal nondiscrimination law. \nEven if federal law did not require Shawnee to maintain and enforce its nondiscrimination \npolicy, Shawnee has every right to enact a nondiscrimination policy more protective than federal \nlaw.  Shawnee has a powerful interest in ensuring that its students receive the education they pay \nfor, and it was entitled to conclude that protecting transgender students from discrimination is \n                                                 \n17 (11th Cir. 2011); Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d \n850, 873 (S.D. Ohio 2016).  The Americans with Disabilities Act may also prohibit such discrimination.  See Tate v. \nWexford Health Source Inc., No. 3:16-cv-92, 2016 WL 687618, at *5 (S.D. Ill. Feb. 19, 2016). \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 15 of 23  PAGEID #: 1912\nnecessary for those students to learn and thrive.  If Plaintiff’s statements undermine Shawnee’s \nmission—ensuring that its students are educated—then the First Amendment allows Shawnee to \nprioritize its mission and regulate the speech of its employees.  See Piggee v. Carl Sandburg Coll., \n464 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir. 2006) (college had an interest in ensuring that instructors “stay on \nmessage” in class and not create environment where student “avoided” instructor and “was \nunhappy that he still had to go to a class” that instructor taught); Poulard v. Trs. of Ind. Univ., No. \n2:16-cv-115, 2018 WL 4680010, at *11 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 28, 2018) (university has “strong interest \nin eliminating [harassing statements] in order to foster an inclusive learning environment.”).4 \nTo permit Plaintiff’s personal preferences regarding the manner in which he will address \nstudents to outweigh Shawnee’s interest in nondiscrimination would vitiate any public university’s \nability to enforce nondiscrimination protections in the classroom.  Plaintiff’s position has no \nlimiting principle: if the manner in which professors address individual students in the classroom \nis exempted from nondiscrimination laws, then a college could not discipline a professor who, \nbased on his sincerely held beliefs, uses derogatory terms to address all nonwhite students, or \nwomen, or students from a minority faith, or students on financial aid.  The Sixth Circuit has held \nthat the First Amendment may not “be used as a shield by teachers who choose to use their unique \nand superior position to sexually harass students secure in the knowledge that whatever they say \nor do will be protected.”  Bonnell, 241 F.3d at 824.  Nor may it be used as a shield by teachers who \nchoose to use their unique and superior positions to discriminate against transgender students.   \n                                                 \n4 Shawnee similarly has an interest in applying its policy consistently, regardless of Plaintiff’s subjective assessment \nof whether his students experience “anxiety, fear, or intimidation.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1479, ¶ 181.   \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 16 of 23  PAGEID #: 1913\nII.  The Free Exercise Clause Does Not Allow Plaintiff to Violate a Neutral, Generally \nApplicable Rule Not Targeted at Any Religious Beliefs or Practices.  \n \nPlaintiff’s Free Exercise claim (Count Four) also fails as a matter of law.  Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policy is a neutral and generally applicable policy that was applied to Plaintiff’s \nconduct without targeting particular religious practices or views.  The nondiscrimination policy \ntherefore did not violate Plaintiff’s right to exercise his religion. \nAn individual’s religious beliefs do not “excuse him from compliance with an otherwise \nvalid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate,” because “[t]he mere possession of \nreligious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve \nthe citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities.”  Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of \nOre. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-79 (1990) (citation omitted), superseded in part by statute as \nstated in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006).  \nTherefore, neutral, generally applicable laws do not violate the Free Exercise Clause unless “the \nobject of [the] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,” \nor if “the purpose of [the] law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct.”  Church of the \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993).  Based on this principle, \nthe Supreme Court in Smith found Oregon’s ban on the use of a hallucinogen did not infringe \nSmith’s right to exercise religion freely even if he used it for religious reasons because the ban was \nneutral, generally applicable, and not aimed at religious practices.  Smith, 494 U.S. at 877-78. \nHere, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim that Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policy was not \nneutral,  or  that  the  policy  was  applied  to  target  and  suppress  his  religious  beliefs.    The \nnondiscrimination  policy  is  neutral  and  generally  applicable  on  its  face:  Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policy applies to “all employees, students, visitors, agents, and volunteers,” in \n“all aspects of the University’s programs and operations.”  Am. Compl. Ex. 2, Doc. 34-2, at \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 17 of 23  PAGEID #: 1914\nPageID 1512.  The Sixth Circuit’s decision in Kissinger v. Board of Trustees of Ohio State \nUniversity, 5 F.3d 177 (6th Cir. 1993), establishes that such policies do not violate the Free \nExercise Clause, even if they may burden a particular person’s religious beliefs.  In Kissinger, a \nveterinary student objected to operating on live animals due to her religious beliefs.  The Sixth \nCircuit found that there was no evidence that the state used its curriculum requirement to “attack \nor exclude any individual on the basis of his or her religious beliefs.”  Id. at 179.  Similarly, Plaintiff \nfails to allege that Shawnee used the nondiscrimination policy to target his religious beliefs.  \nShawnee applied its policy without regard to Plaintiff’s religion; it is Plaintiff who introduced his \nreligious beliefs as a basis for seeking an exception to the policy.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1469, 1478, 1482, 1485, 1488, ¶¶ 86, 92, 170, 208, 237, 253.  Plaintiff’s unilateral \ninvocation of his religious beliefs to avoid complying with a generally applicable, neutral policy \ndoes not demonstrate improper motivation by Shawnee. \nPlaintiff  alleges  that  Shawnee’s  enforcement  of  its  nondiscrimination  policy  reflects \nhostility towards his religious beliefs, but his conclusory allegations do not plausibly state a free-\nexercise claim.  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Pauley, the department chair, expressed \n“hostility” to his religious beliefs.  But this discussion occurred in November 2016, well over a \nyear before Ms. Doe even took his class and lodged a Title IX complaint, and even Plaintiff’s \nallegations draw no connection between this alleged conversation and the nondiscrimination policy \nor his warning for violating it.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1473, ¶¶ 119-121. \nSecond, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Bauer expressed hostility towards his religious \nbeliefs when he stated that he would not grant a religious accommodation to Plaintiff because such \nan accommodation would then be available to any faculty member with sincerely held religious \nbeliefs that may discriminate on the basis of sex or race.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1490-\n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 18 of 23  PAGEID #: 1915\n1491, ¶¶ 279-81.  Despite Plaintiff’s allegation to the contrary, Defendant Bauer’s statements \nreaffirmed the fact that the nondiscrimination policy was neutral and generally applicable.  As \nDefendant Bauer recognized, public officials should not decide which religious beliefs are good \nand which are bad—such distinctions are repugnant to the Free Exercise Clause, which requires \nthe state to be neutral between religions and “forbids subtle departures from neutrality.”  City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. at 534.  If Plaintiff was entitled to an exemption from nondiscrimination laws \nbased on his religious beliefs, other professors would be too—even if those professors’ religious \nbeliefs mandated other forms of discrimination on the basis of race or sex.  Defendant Bauer’s \nexpression of this elementary principle of neutrality did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. \nThird, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Bauer laughed when the Union president explained \nhow disciplinary actions against Plaintiff would violate his religious beliefs. Am. Compl., Doc. \n34, at PageID 1488, ¶ 258.  Even accepting this factual allegation as true, it is not the basis for a \nfree-exercise claim.  See A’la v. Cobb, 208 F.3d 212 (6th Cir. 2000) (“De minimis events simply \ndo not state constitutional claims”). \nFinally, Plaintiff cannot state a free-exercise claim based on the conclusory allegation that \nthe nondiscrimination policy represents “a system of individualized assessments.”  Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1498, ¶ 337.  Plaintiff does not allege that Shawnee has ever, or will ever, grant \nany exemption from its policy that transgender students must be treated in conformance with their \ngender identity.  See Kissinger, 5 F.3d at 179 (finding that plaintiff failed to show that the school \nhad a system of exemptions that allowed students to graduate without completing the required \nsurgical coursework).  To the extent Plaintiff is referring to the fact that Shawnee performs an \nindividualized investigation before deciding whether a faculty member has violated university \npolicy, the Free Exercise Clause does not prohibit Shawnee from giving its professors due process. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 19 of 23  PAGEID #: 1916\nIII.  Plaintiff’s State Free Exercise Claim Must Be Dismissed.  \n \nPlaintiff’s free exercise claim under Article I, § 7 of the Ohio Constitution (Count Eight) \nalso fails as a matter of law.  First, the state law claim is foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment. \nSee Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Def. Mot. to Dismiss, \nDoc. 22, at PageID 583-584.  Even if Pennhurst does not apply, the Court should still decline to \nexercise its supplemental jurisdiction over this state law claim if all federal law claims are \ndismissed.  Gamel v. City of Cincinnati, 625 F.3d 949, 952 (6th Cir. 2010) (“When all federal \nclaims are dismissed before trial, the balance of considerations usually will point to dismissing the \nstate law claims.” (internal citation omitted)). \nIt would be particularly appropriate to decline supplemental jurisdiction here, given that \nno Ohio case has applied Article I, § 7 of the Ohio Constitution in analogous circumstances.  The \nOhio Supreme Court has held that a prison guard had the state constitutional right to wear his hair \nlong for religious reasons even if this violates a generally applicable grooming policy.  Humphrey \nv. Lane, 728 N.E.2d 1039, 1043 (Ohio 2000).  In that context, the court applied the rule that “the \nstandard for reviewing a generally applicable, religion-neutral state regulation that allegedly \nviolates a person’s right to free exercise of religion is whether the regulation serves a compelling \nstate interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.”  Id.  But this case presents \na very different scenario.  In Humphrey, the plaintiff did his job as dictated by the state—he simply \nwanted to wear his hair long while doing so.  Here, Plaintiff seeks to discriminate in the exercise \nof his state-conferred authority.  Supra, at Part I.A.1.  Thus, Plaintiff is analogous to a prison guard \nwho argues that the state constitution protects his right to discriminate against transgender inmates \nbecause this is required by his religious beliefs.  The Ohio Supreme Court should have the chance \nto consider this unprecedented claim in the first instance. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 20 of 23  PAGEID #: 1917\nEven if the state-law claim were properly before this Court, it would lack merit.  Even \nassuming the compelling-state-interest test of Humphrey applies here, the state satisfied it as a \nmatter of law: the state has a compelling state interest in preventing discrimination against \ntransgender students, and the nondiscrimination policy is the least restrictive means of achieving \nthat policy.  Supra, Part I.C.  Further, even if the enforcement of Shawnee’s nondiscrimination \npolicies violated Article I, § 7, the application of Article I, § 7 would be preempted by Title IX.  \nAs explained above, federal law requires Shawnee to maintain a nondiscrimination policy that \nensures that transgender students are treated by their professors in accordance with their gender \nidentity.  Supra, Part I.C.  Any state law that prevents Shawnee from enforcing Title IX stands as \nan “obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” \nbecause it is impossible for Shawnee to comply with both federal law (Title IX) and state law (the \nstate Free Exercise Clause).  Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372–73 (2000).   \nIV.  Plaintiff’s Remaining Claims Lack Merit. \n \nDue Process.  Plaintiff’s due process claim (Count Six) must be dismissed because \nShawnee’s nondiscrimination policy is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Due Process Clause \nrequires “sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited \nand in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,” Kolender v. \nLawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983), though it does not require legislating in “encyclopedic terms.”  \nUnited States v. Jenkins, 770 F.3d 507, 510 (6th Cir. 2014).   \nPlaintiff has not plausibly alleged that the nondiscrimination policy is unconstitutionally \nvague on its face.  The policy is crystal clear: all students, transgender or not, must be treated in \naccordance with their gender identity.  The policy is also not vague as applied to Plaintiff: \nPlaintiff’s own factual allegations show that Shawnee has clearly communicated what the policy \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 21 of 23  PAGEID #: 1918\nrequired multiple times and that Plaintiff was on notice.  In August 2016, over a year before Ms. \nDoe started taking his class, faculty members of the University were informed that they could face \ndisciplinary action if “they refused to use a student’s requested name or pronoun.” Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1472, ¶ 107.  In October 2016, Defendant Milliken personally informed \nPlaintiff  that  the  nondiscrimination  policies  meant  that  professors  must  utilize  a  student’s \nrequested pronoun, “regardless of the professor’s convictions or views.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1472, ¶ 112.  Defendant Milliken then personally informed Plaintiff that he would be \n“subject to administrative disciplinary procedures if he refused to use a pronoun that reflects a \nstudent’s self-asserted gender identity.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 16, ¶ 114.  This same \ninterpretation of the policy was communicated to Plaintiff again in 2018, during the disciplinary \nprocess.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1483, ¶ 215.  Thus, the University enforced the policy \nin a clear, non-arbitrary manner, and Plaintiff was given ample notice as to what it required.   \nEqual protection.  Plaintiff’s equal protection claim (Count Seven) must be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiff failed to allege any disparate treatment.  “The threshold element of an equal \nprotection claim is disparate treatment; once disparate treatment is shown, the equal protection \nanalysis to be applied is determined by the classification used by government decision-makers.”  \nScarbrough v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 470 F.3d 250, 260 (6th Cir. 2006).  Here, Plaintiff has \nnot alleged that any other professor at the University refused to call on students according to their \ngender identity but was not disciplined for doing so; nor has Plaintiff alleged that Shawnee failed \nto discipline other professors at the University who violated the nondiscrimination policy.5 \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiff’s amended complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.  \n \n                                                 \n5 Ms. Doe and SAGA adopt the State’s arguments regarding Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim (Count Nine).   \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 37 Filed: 02/11/19 Page: 22 of 23  PAGEID #: 1919\nDate: February 11, 2019      Respectfully Submitted, \n \n            /s/ Adam G.

Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1464, ¶ 53.  Shawnee enforces \nwritten nondiscrimination policies that apply to all Shawnee employees.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1464-1465, ¶¶ 55, 61; Am. Compl. Ex. 1, Doc. 34-1, at PageID 1509-1510; Am. Compl. \nEx. 2, Doc. 34-2, at PageID 1511-1512.  Among other policies, Shawnee prohibits “Sex and \nGender Based Discrimination,” including “adverse treatment on based on . . . gender identity,” \nwhich is defined as treatment that “denies or limits [an] individual’s ability to obtain the benefits \nof Shawnee State’s programs or activities.” Am. Compl. Ex. 2, Doc. 1-2, at PageID 1522. \nPlaintiff Nicholas Meriwether is employed as a professor at Shawnee.  Am. Compl., Doc. \n34, at PageID 1469-1470, ¶¶ 93-95.  Like other employees, he is required to comply with \nShawnee’s nondiscrimination policy.  Am. Compl. Ex. 2, Doc. 34-2, at PageID 1512.  In 2016, \nPlaintiff received guidance that, in order to comply with Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policies \nand its obligations under Title IX, employees must treat transgender students equally, including \naddressing transgender students in accord with the student’s gender identity, and that failure to do \nso could result in discipline.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1471-1473, ¶¶ 106-112, 114, 124.  \nOn January 9, 2018, Plaintiff began teaching a course in Political Philosophy at Shawnee.  \nAm. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 125.  Among the students in his class was Defendant-\nIntervenor Jane Doe, Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 128, a transgender woman.  During \nthe first class session, Plaintiff referred to Ms. Doe as “sir.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID \n1474, ¶ 128.  After class, Ms. Doe approached Plaintiff to inform him of this mistaken gender \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 3 of 23  PAGEID #: 1976\nidentification, and to request that Plaintiff refer to her using female honorifics and pronouns.  Am. \nCompl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1475, ¶¶ 140-141.  Plaintiff refused to do so.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, \nat PageID 1475, ¶ 141.  In subsequent class periods, Plaintiff singled out Ms. Doe by referring \nonly to her by her surname,1 while continuing to use honorifics for other students whose gender \nidentities matched Plaintiff’s assumptions.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1476, ¶¶ 153-154.  \nDespite her distress at being singled out in this stigmatizing manner, Ms. Doe was required to \ncontinue  answering  questions  when  called  upon  by  Plaintiff.

Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1485-\n1486, ¶¶ 233, 239.  Plaintiff was issued a written warning, and advised to comply with Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policies when addressing students.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1487, \n¶¶ 246-248.  Plaintiff then filed a union grievance against Shawnee, which was denied, Am. \nCompl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1489, ¶ 264, and this lawsuit followed. \nARGUMENT \nShawnee’s nondiscrimination policies require that when its employees address a student, \nthey respect the student’s gender identity.  The policy applies to all employees, regardless of \nwhether they are professors or not.  The policy does not apply to an employee’s scholarship nor \ndoes it limit any employee’s freedom to express views on any subject or to teach any subject.  \nPlaintiff may disagree with this workplace policy, but it does not violate the Constitution.  A public \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff did subsequently refer to Ms. Doe as “Mr.” Doe in at least one later class period, but alleges this was \n“inadvertent[].”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1477-1478, ¶ 165. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 4 of 23  PAGEID #: 1977\nemployer, like a private employer, may insist that its employees adhere to a nondiscrimination \npolicy when undertaking their job-related duties. \nI.  Plaintiff Has Not Stated a Claim Under the Free Speech Clause. \n \nPlaintiff brings four free-speech claims: “Retaliation” (Count One), “Content & Viewpoint \nDiscrimination”  (Count  Two),  “Compelled  Speech”  (Count  Three),  and  “Unconstitutional \nConditions” (Count Five).  Each claim boils down to the same theory: the Free Speech Clause \nprevents Shawnee from requiring him to use female pronouns when addressing Ms. Doe.   \nThese claims fail for three independent reasons.  First, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. \n410 (2006), Shawnee does not violate the Free Speech Clause by requiring its employees to adhere \nto workplace policies when acting in their capacity as employees.  That rule forecloses Plaintiff’s \nfree-speech claim: his in-classroom speech while teaching Shawnee students plainly occurs in his \ncapacity as an employee.  Second, even for speech made as a citizen rather than an employee, the \nFirst Amendment protects public employees’ speech only when it addresses a matter of “public \nconcern.”  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 (1983).  The only speech at issue here—which is \nsolely about how to address a particular student—falls far short of meeting the “public concern” \nrequirement.  Third, even if Plaintiff’s speech were on an issue of public concern, the First \nAmendment would permit Shawnee to establish and enforce a nondiscrimination policy to ensure \nthat its transgender students have an equal opportunity to get a university education. \nA.  Plaintiff Cannot Base a First Amendment Claim on Speech Made Pursuant to His \nOfficial Duties.  \n \n1.  A State Employer May Require Its Employee to Adhere to Workplace Rules, Including \nThose That Affect Work-Related Speech. \n \nPlaintiff’s free-speech claims are precluded by Garcetti.  In Garcetti, the Supreme Court \nheld that “when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 5 of 23  PAGEID #: 1978\nare not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate \ntheir communications from employer discipline.”  Id. at 421.  Garcetti is controlling here, where \nPlaintiff’s in-class speech referring to a particular student falls squarely within “statements [made] \npursuant to [his] official duties” as a Shawnee employee.  Id.  Plaintiff alleges that he “regularly \ncalls on students to answer questions about the assigned readings and to participate in class \ndiscussions.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 126.  “To him, using the Socratic method \nof instruction is fundamental to teaching philosophy.”  Id.  Plaintiff’s use of male pronouns in \naddressing Ms. Doe, which led to this dispute, occurred in connection with one such Socratic \ndialogue.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1474, ¶ 128.  Thus, Plaintiff’s speech was made in \nclass, in his capacity as a professor.  Under Garcetti, that resolves this case.  When, as here, an \nemployee is “simply performing his or her job duties,” there is “no warrant” for a “delicate \nbalancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences.”  Garcetti, 547 \nU.S. at 423.  Plaintiff’s status as facilitator of classroom discussions “owe[d] its existence to \n[Plaintiff’s]  professional  responsibilities,”  and  therefore  Shawnee’s  enforcement  of  a \nnondiscrimination code placing certain limits on that interaction “does not infringe any liberties \nthe employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.”  Id. at 421-22; see also id. at 422 (the First \nAmendment does not give public employees “a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.”). \nGarcetti’s holding that the First Amendment does not generally exempt public employees \nfrom having to comply with rules about workplace conduct and speech is particularly compelling \nhere, where Plaintiff exercised authority over Jane Doe as a direct result of his official position as \na Shawnee employee.  To be clear, Garcetti applies even when an employee is not exercising such \nauthority—for  instance,  in  Garcetti  itself,  the  plaintiff  was  a  whistleblower,  writing  a \nmemorandum to get his supervisor’s attention.  Here, however, Plaintiff is exercising authority—\n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 6 of 23  PAGEID #: 1979\nmaking his claim for immunity from workplace rules even weaker.  In his capacity as professor, \nPlaintiff decides which students may speak, what questions they must answer, and how the \nstudent’s participation will affect the student’s grade.  Public institutions that confer authority are \nentitled to regulate the exercise of that authority, including to ensure that students are treated fairly \nand respectfully and are able to participate in and benefit from their courses.  Shawnee employs \nPlaintiff as a professor and grants the authority to call upon students in class and to grade them on \ntheir classroom participation.  The Free Speech Clause does not give Plaintiff a right to exercise \nthat authority on behalf of the university in whatever manner he sees fit. \n2.  Plaintiff’s Role as a Professor Does Not Exempt Him from Garcetti or Shawnee’s \nNondiscrimination Policies. \n \nPlaintiff’s contention that he is exempt from Garcetti because he is a professor has no \nmerit.  As the Sixth Circuit has explained, public universities may require professors to adhere to \nuniversity policies regarding in-class instruction without running afoul of the First Amendment.  \n“Academic freedom implicates the freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to \neducation, requiring deference to a university’s academic decisions.”  Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of \nEduc. of Tipp City Exempted Vill. Sch. Dist., 624 F.3d 332, 344 (6th Cir. 2010).  “In the context \nof in-class curricular speech,” even “in the university arena,” “a teacher’s invocation of academic \nfreedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an educational institution’s decisions.”  Id. \n(citations and quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, a school may go as far as to dismiss a professor \nbased on a professor’s teaching methods without implicating the First Amendment.  See id. (a \nschool “may constitutionally choose not to renew the contract of a nontenured professor when that \nprofessor’s pedagogical attitude and teaching methods do not conform to institutional standards”). \nHere, Shawnee is merely requiring that Plaintiff use honorifics consistent with students’ \ngender identity while interacting with them, if he chooses to refer to his students using honorifics.  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 7 of 23  PAGEID #: 1980\nThis requirement applies identically to him as it does to every other Shawnee employee, see Am. \nCompl. Ex. 2, Doc. 34-2, at PageID 1512, and to all official-capacity interactions, not just \nclassroom interactions, see Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1472, ¶ 108.  Plaintiff alleges that \nreferring to Ms. Doe with female pronouns violates Plaintiff’s “sincerely held religious beliefs as \na Christian . . . related to gender identity,” id., at PageID 1482, ¶ 208, but these allegations are \nunrelated to his status as a professor.  Campus police officers, secretaries, and custodians may have \nequally sincere religious objections to referring to students consistent with their gender identity, \nyet Plaintiff does not appear to dispute that under Garcetti, Shawnee can require those employees, \nwhile on the job, to adhere to its nondiscrimination policy.  That Plaintiff is a professor does not \nentitle him to an exemption from Shawnee’s requirement that employees refrain from treating \nstudents unequally on the basis of their gender identity, including when addressing students in \nclass.   \nPlaintiff characterizes Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policy  as an attack on academic \nfreedom, as though Shawnee were seeking to censor his scholarship or freedom to express any \nviews he wishes on gender, transgender issues, or anything else.  E.g., Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1481, ¶¶ 202, 204.  But the Complaint alleges no facts that support that assertion.  While \nPlaintiff’s  course  may  be  related  to  “ethics  and  human  nature,”  Am.  Compl.,  Doc.  34,  at \nPageID 1481, ¶ 202, Plaintiff does not allege that Shawnee has required him to voice, or refrain \nfrom voicing, any positions or views on those topics.  Being required to refer to transgender \nstudents in a manner consistent with students’ gender identity in order to ensure that all students \nare able to participate in and benefit from their courses does not infringe upon Plaintiff’s scholarly \nfreedom, any more than similar rules requiring professors to hold classes on time, post office hours, \nor avoid subjecting students to harassing speech or behavior.  See, e.g., Johnson Kurek v. Abu-\n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 8 of 23  PAGEID #: 1981\nAbsi, 423 F.3d 590, 595 (6th Cir. 2005) (“While the First Amendment may protect Johnson-\nKurek’s right to express her ideas about pedagogy, it does not require that the university permit \nher to teach her classes in accordance with those ideas.  The freedom of a university to decide what \nmay be taught and how it shall be taught would be meaningless if a professor were entitled to \nrefuse to comply with university requirements whenever they conflict with his or her teaching \nphilosophy.”). \nPlaintiff cannot characterize this as an academic freedom case merely by alleging that \nuttering “Ms. Doe” implicitly conveys his views about gender.  Shawnee’s policy does not restrict \nPlaintiff’s freedom to write scholarly articles about gender or to teach his philosophical views \nabout gender or anything else.  Plaintiff cannot credibly claim that there is any scholarly interest \nin disclosing his views about the gender of a particular student as male or female.  Complying with \nShawnee’s policy does not affect the content of his instruction; it merely requires Plaintiff—while \nexercising his university-conferred authority—to treat transgender students in accord with their \ngender  identity.    Academic  freedom  does  not  preclude  a  public  university  from  requiring \nprofessors to adhere to basic norms of civil behavior.  See Savage v. Gee, 665 F.3d 732, 739 (6th \nCir. 2012) (speech that “was only loosely, if at all, related to academic scholarship . . . does not \nfall within the realm of speech that might fall outside of Garcetti’s reach”). \nPlaintiff’s  amended  complaint  adds  allegations  that  he  has  “assiduously  avoided” \ndiscussing issues related to gender identity in his classes as a result of the warning he received.  \nAm. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1492, ¶ 296.  Plaintiff now speculates that “any further complaint \nregarding how he communicates on issues related to gender identity” could result in further \ndisciplinary actions.  Id. at PageID 1492, ¶ 290.  These allegations cannot save his free speech \nclaim.  Plaintiff offers no allegations, and his many exhibits do not remotely suggest, that anyone \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 9 of 23  PAGEID #: 1982\nat Shawnee ever tried to prevent Plaintiff from writing or speaking about gender identity.  To the \ncontrary, as Plaintiff himself alleges, Shawnee merely required him to “refer to students using titles \nand pronouns that reflect each student’s self-asserted gender identity.”  Id. at PageID 1477, ¶ 164.  \nTo the extent Plaintiff declines to include topics related to transgender issues on his syllabus, that \nis his personal choice and presents no First Amendment concern.  In any event, Sixth Circuit \nprecedent establishes that the First Amendment does not confer upon professors the right to teach \nthe syllabus of their choosing over a university’s objection.  See Evans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 344 \n(because “[i]t is the educational institution that has a right to academic freedom, not the individual \nteacher,” “a teacher’s invocation of academic freedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an \neducational institution’s decisions” (quotation marks omitted)). \nAccepting Plaintiff’s position would have far-reaching implications.  For instance, a \nprofessor who believes that women should not be pursuing higher education could refuse to call \nupon them in class, or call men by their surnames and refer to all women by their first names or \nsimply as “woman.”  A professor who believes that married women must be subservient to their \nhusbands could insist on calling all married women by their husband’s surnames even if they have \nnot changed their surnames after marriage.  And he could declare that the college is powerless to \nstop him because such statements “communicate[] his own views on these subjects.”  Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1481, ¶ 204.  Likewise, a professor hostile to a student’s religion could refuse \nto use names associated with a particular religion or even refer to the student as a “heathen” in \nclass—and declare that the Constitution affords him the right to do so because he personally \nbelieves the student to be a heathen.  The Constitution does not require that college classrooms be \nfree from evenhanded applications of nondiscrimination policies that simply seek to ensure that \nall students are able to participate in and benefit from their courses.   \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 10 of 23  PAGEID #: 1983\nB.  Plaintiff’s Speech Was on a Matter of Private Concern. \n \nPlaintiff’s claims also fail because referring to a student in order to call upon her in class \nto answer a question or contribute to the class discussion is not speaking on a “matter[] of public \nconcern.”  Mayhew v. Town of Smyrna, 856 F.3d 456, 462 (6th Cir. 2017).  As such, Shawnee may \nrespond to that speech without “intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First \nAmendment.”  Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. \nSpeech addresses a matter of public concern if it relates to a “matter of political, social, or \nother concern to the community, or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject \nof general interest and of value and concern to the public.”  Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 241 \n(2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “Whether an employee’s speech addresses \na matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given \nstatement, as revealed by the whole record.”  Connick, 461 U.S. at 147–48.  \nThis is a paradigmatic case of speech on a matter of private concern.  Plaintiff’s speech \nexclusively involves workplace interactions.  It is directed to one person for the limited purpose \nof informing Ms. Doe that she is being called upon to answer a question—not to express the \nprofessor’s views on a particular group of people or on anything else.  See Am. Compl., Doc. 34, \nat PageID 1480, ¶¶ 193-195 (alleging that “potential violation” of nondiscrimination policy \ninvolved only Plaintiff’s matter of addressing Ms. Doe individually).  It is no more a “matter of \npublic concern” than any other situation in which a public employee addresses a member of the \npublic in the course of the employee’s official duties.   \nPlaintiff insists that the reason he referred to Ms. Doe with a male pronoun is that he holds \npersonal views on an issue of public concern.  But Plaintiff misunderstands the “public concern” \ntest.  The purpose of that test is to encourage discourse on “issues about which information is \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 11 of 23  PAGEID #: 1984\nneeded or appropriate to enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the \noperation of their government.”  Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, 590 (6th Cir. 2004).  Thus, whether \nspeech is on a matter of “public concern” turns on the information that the speech imparts—which \nrequires an analysis of what was said, rather than the internal motivations of the speaker.  See id. \nat 591 (“the pertinent question is not why the employee spoke, but what he said,” and the argument \nthat “subjective motivations are dispositive when determining whether . . . speech addresses a \nmatter of purely personal concern is in direct conflict with the Supreme Court’s holding in \nConnick” (citation omitted)).  Thus, a letter to the editor denouncing corruption in government is \nof “public concern” even if the writer’s subjective motivation is to advance his or her career.  See, \ne.g., Westmoreland v. Sutherland, 662 F.3d 714, 719 (6th Cir. 2011) (statements about public \nsafety were on matters of public concern, even if motivated by plaintiff’s own financial losses); \nRodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 600 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Although Plaintiff’s underlying motive in \nwriting the memo might have been to complain about incompetent management, our duty is not to \ndiscern her underlying motive, but rather to evaluate her point as it is presented in the speech.”).  \nConversely, a statement of private concern is not transformed into a statement of public concern \neven if it is motivated by broader public considerations.  See, e.g., Nair v. Oakland Cnty. Cmty. \nMental Health Auth., 443 F.3d 469, 479-80 (6th Cir. 2006) (subjective motivations for authoring \nletter were irrelevant when letter itself did not touch on issue of public concern). \nThus, the Court must analyze not Plaintiff’s personal motives for using male honorifics or \ncalling Ms. Doe by her last name only, but the utterances themselves—i.e., his referring to Ms. \nDoe as “Mr. Doe” or “Doe.”  And they do not address a matter of public concern.2  They tell Ms. \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff’s amended complaint adds the conclusory allegation that his “comments about gender identity . . . address \nmatters of public concern.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1481, ¶ 202.  But Plaintiff cannot use this allegation to \novercome a motion to dismiss, because “[w]hether or not a plaintiff’s speech touches on a matter of public concern \nis a question of law.”  Handy-Clay v. City of Memphis, 695 F.3d 531, 543 (6th Cir. 2012). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 12 of 23  PAGEID #: 1985\nDoe a question is coming.  That Plaintiff possesses personal opinions on broader social questions \nthat, if conveyed, might be of “public concern” does not transform his routine honorifics into \nstatements that “enable the members of society to make informed decisions about the operation of \ntheir government.”  Farhat, 370 F.3d at 590.  Indeed Plaintiff’s use of pronouns did not convey \nany information of public concern—even his own beliefs about gender—because a reasonable \nlistener would understand the use of female pronouns to reflect nothing more than the ordinary \ncivility that would be expected in any interaction between a professor and a student.  See, e.g., \nR.G. & G.R., 884 F.3d at 566 n.1 (“We refer to Stephens using female pronouns, in accordance \nwith the preference she has expressed through her briefing to this court.”).   \nPlaintiff’s manner of addressing Ms. Doe conveys one additional piece of information: it \n“outs” Ms. Doe as a transgender woman.  This further confirms that his statement is not on a matter \nof “public concern.”  Whether a person is transgender is the antithesis of information of “public \nconcern”—it is intensely private, personal information, as the Court acknowledged in its Order \ngranting Ms. Doe’s motion to proceed pseudonymously.  Order, Doc. 32 at PageID 1081-1082.  \nThere is a fundamental difference between gender as a general matter—a matter of public \nconcern—and a particular person’s status as transgender—a matter of private concern.  Conveying \nthe latter information does not transform Plaintiff’s speech into information of public concern \nmerely because the speaker is motivated by opinions about gender, any more than publicly \ndisclosing a specific person’s cancer diagnosis is a matter of “public concern” because the speaker \nintends to educate the public that cancer diagnoses are widespread. \nIf Plaintiff’s argument were correct, then public employees could convert any refusal to \ncomply with a workplace policy into speech on a matter of public concern simply by claiming that \ntheir violation is intended to “send a message” about some broader issue.  For example, a professor \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 13 of 23  PAGEID #: 1986\nwho believes that second marriages are sinful could claim a free-speech right to refuse to use a \nstudent’s married name in order to convey that belief.  Or a professor who believes that a particular \nreligion or nationality is “a lie” could claim a free speech right to convey that belief by refusing to \nrefer to a student by a name that signals adherence to that religion or nationality.  Neither the Sixth \nCircuit nor any other court has adopted such extreme reasoning. \nC.  Even Under First Amendment Balancing, Plaintiff’s Claim Fails. \n \nEven if Plaintiff were speaking as a citizen rather than as an employee, and his statements \nwere on a matter of public concern, his Free Speech claim would fail.  Plaintiff’s “interests . . . in \ncommenting upon matters of public concern” do not outweigh “the interest of the State, as an \nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.”  \nEvans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 338 (quoting Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High Sch. Dist. 205, \n391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)).  Here, Shawnee’s interest in maintaining its nondiscrimination policy \noutweighs Plaintiff’s interest in addressing Ms. Doe using particular honorifics. \nShawnee has a powerful interest in maintaining its nondiscrimination policy.  Colleges are \n“legally required to maintain a hostile-free learning environment and must strive to create policies \nwhich serve that purpose,” and have every right to protect their students’ “right to learn in a \nhostil[ity]-free environment.”  Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 823-24 (6th Cir. 2001).  “Speech \nthat rises to the level of harassment—whether based on sex, race, ethnicity, or other invidious \npremise—and which creates a hostile learning environment that ultimately thwarts the academic \nprocess, is speech that a learning institution has a strong interest in preventing.”  Id. at 824.   \nIn this case, Title IX3 requires Shawnee to maintain a nondiscrimination policy that ensures \nthat transgender students are treated in accordance with their gender identity.  Title IX provides \n                                                 \n3 Because Shawnee is a public institution, the Equal Protection Clause similarly prohibits discrimination against Jane \nDoe on account of her gender identity.  See City of Salem, 378 F.3d at 577; Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316–\n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 14 of 23  PAGEID #: 1987\nthat “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  A university violates Title IX when \nits officials in positions of authority “had actual notice of, and [were] deliberately indifferent to, \nthe misconduct.”  Mallory v. Ohio Univ., 76 F. App’x 634, 638 (6th Cir. 2003); Sahm v. Miami \nUniv., 110 F. Supp. 3d 774, 778 (S.D. Ohio 2015).  Shawnee would be liable under that standard \nif it knowingly allowed its employees to discriminate against transgender students. \nThe  Sixth  Circuit  has  held  that  discrimination  against  transgender  individuals  is \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex” for Title VII purposes.  EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral \nHomes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560, 571 (6th Cir. 2018) (“discrimination on the basis of transgender and \ntransitioning status violates Title VII.”).  Title IX similarly prohibits discrimination “on the basis \nof sex,” so discrimination against transgender individuals violates Title IX as well.  See Miles v. \nN.Y. Univ., 979 F. Supp. 248, 250 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (“[T]he Title IX term ‘on the basis of sex’ \nis interpreted in the same manner as similar language in Title VII”); see also Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1049 (7th Cir. 2017) (school policy that \n“punishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance . . . violates Title IX”).  Shawnee \nhas a compelling interest in complying with federal nondiscrimination law. \nEven if federal law did not require Shawnee to maintain and enforce its nondiscrimination \npolicy, Shawnee has every right to enact a nondiscrimination policy more protective than federal \nlaw.  Shawnee has a powerful interest in ensuring that its students receive the education they pay \nfor, and it was entitled to conclude that protecting transgender students from discrimination is \n                                                 \n17 (11th Cir. 2011); Bd. of Educ. of the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d \n850, 873 (S.D. Ohio 2016).  The Americans with Disabilities Act may also prohibit such discrimination.  See Tate v. \nWexford Health Source Inc., No. 3:16-cv-92, 2016 WL 687618, at *5 (S.D. Ill.

If Plaintiff’s statements undermine Shawnee’s \nmission—ensuring that its students are educated—then the First Amendment allows Shawnee to \nprioritize its mission and regulate the speech of its employees.  See Piggee v. Carl Sandburg Coll., \n464 F.3d 667, 671-72 (7th Cir. 2006) (college had an interest in ensuring that instructors “stay on \nmessage” in class and not create environment where student “avoided” instructor and “was \nunhappy that he still had to go to a class” that instructor taught); Poulard v. Trs. of Ind. Univ., No. \n2:16-cv-115, 2018 WL 4680010, at *11 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 28, 2018) (university has “strong interest \nin eliminating [harassing statements] in order to foster an inclusive learning environment.”).4 \nTo permit Plaintiff’s personal preferences regarding the manner in which he will address \nstudents to outweigh Shawnee’s interest in nondiscrimination would vitiate any public university’s \nability to enforce nondiscrimination protections in the classroom.  Plaintiff’s position has no \nlimiting principle: if the manner in which professors address individual students in the classroom \nis exempted from nondiscrimination laws, then a college could not discipline a professor who, \nbased on his sincerely held beliefs, uses derogatory terms to address all nonwhite students, or \nwomen, or students from a minority faith, or students on financial aid.  The Sixth Circuit has held \nthat the First Amendment may not “be used as a shield by teachers who choose to use their unique \nand superior position to sexually harass students secure in the knowledge that whatever they say \nor do will be protected.”  Bonnell, 241 F.3d at 824.  Nor may it be used as a shield by teachers who \nchoose to use their unique and superior positions to discriminate against transgender students.   \n                                                 \n4 Shawnee similarly has an interest in applying its policy consistently, regardless of Plaintiff’s subjective assessment \nof whether his students experience “anxiety, fear, or intimidation.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1479, ¶ 181.   \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 16 of 23  PAGEID #: 1989\nII.  The Free Exercise Clause Does Not Allow Plaintiff to Violate a Neutral, Generally \nApplicable Rule Not Targeted at Any Religious Beliefs or Practices.  \n \nPlaintiff’s Free Exercise claim (Count Four) also fails as a matter of law.  Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policy is a neutral and generally applicable policy that was applied to Plaintiff’s \nconduct without targeting particular religious practices or views.  The nondiscrimination policy \ntherefore did not violate Plaintiff’s right to exercise his religion. \nAn individual’s religious beliefs do not “excuse him from compliance with an otherwise \nvalid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate,” because “[t]he mere possession of \nreligious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve \nthe citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities.”  Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of \nOre. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-79 (1990) (citation omitted), superseded in part by statute as \nstated in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006).  \nTherefore, neutral, generally applicable laws do not violate the Free Exercise Clause unless “the \nobject of [the] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,” \nor if “the purpose of [the] law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct.”  Church of the \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993).  Based on this principle, \nthe Supreme Court in Smith found Oregon’s ban on the use of a hallucinogen did not infringe \nSmith’s right to exercise religion freely even if he used it for religious reasons because the ban was \nneutral, generally applicable, and not aimed at religious practices.  Smith, 494 U.S. at 877-78. \nHere, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim that Shawnee’s nondiscrimination policy was not \nneutral,  or  that  the  policy  was  applied  to  target  and  suppress  his  religious  beliefs.    The \nnondiscrimination  policy  is  neutral  and  generally  applicable  on  its  face:  Shawnee’s \nnondiscrimination policy applies to “all employees, students, visitors, agents, and volunteers,” in \n“all aspects of the University’s programs and operations.”  Am. Compl. Ex. 2, Doc. 34-2, at \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 17 of 23  PAGEID #: 1990\nPageID 1512.  The Sixth Circuit’s decision in Kissinger v. Board of Trustees of Ohio State \nUniversity, 5 F.3d 177 (6th Cir. 1993), establishes that such policies do not violate the Free \nExercise Clause, even if they may burden a particular person’s religious beliefs.  In Kissinger, a \nveterinary student objected to operating on live animals due to her religious beliefs.  The Sixth \nCircuit found that there was no evidence that the state used its curriculum requirement to “attack \nor exclude any individual on the basis of his or her religious beliefs.”  Id. at 179.  Similarly, Plaintiff \nfails to allege that Shawnee used the nondiscrimination policy to target his religious beliefs.  \nShawnee applied its policy without regard to Plaintiff’s religion; it is Plaintiff who introduced his \nreligious beliefs as a basis for seeking an exception to the policy.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1469, 1478, 1482, 1485, 1488, ¶¶ 86, 92, 170, 208, 237, 253.  Plaintiff’s unilateral \ninvocation of his religious beliefs to avoid complying with a generally applicable, neutral policy \ndoes not demonstrate improper motivation by Shawnee. \nPlaintiff  alleges  that  Shawnee’s  enforcement  of  its  nondiscrimination  policy  reflects \nhostility towards his religious beliefs, but his conclusory allegations do not plausibly state a free-\nexercise claim.  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Pauley, the department chair, expressed \n“hostility” to his religious beliefs.  But this discussion occurred in November 2016, well over a \nyear before Ms. Doe even took his class and lodged a Title IX complaint, and even Plaintiff’s \nallegations draw no connection between this alleged conversation and the nondiscrimination policy \nor his warning for violating it.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1473, ¶¶ 119-121. \nSecond, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Bauer expressed hostility towards his religious \nbeliefs when he stated that he would not grant a religious accommodation to Plaintiff because such \nan accommodation would then be available to any faculty member with sincerely held religious \nbeliefs that may discriminate on the basis of sex or race.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1490-\n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 18 of 23  PAGEID #: 1991\n1491, ¶¶ 279-81.  Despite Plaintiff’s allegation to the contrary, Defendant Bauer’s statements \nreaffirmed the fact that the nondiscrimination policy was neutral and generally applicable.  As \nDefendant Bauer recognized, public officials should not decide which religious beliefs are good \nand which are bad—such distinctions are repugnant to the Free Exercise Clause, which requires \nthe state to be neutral between religions and “forbids subtle departures from neutrality.”  City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. at 534.  If Plaintiff was entitled to an exemption from nondiscrimination laws \nbased on his religious beliefs, other professors would be too—even if those professors’ religious \nbeliefs mandated other forms of discrimination on the basis of race or sex.  Defendant Bauer’s \nexpression of this elementary principle of neutrality did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. \nThird, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Bauer laughed when the Union president explained \nhow disciplinary actions against Plaintiff would violate his religious beliefs. Am. Compl., Doc. \n34, at PageID 1488, ¶ 258.  Even accepting this factual allegation as true, it is not the basis for a \nfree-exercise claim.  See A’la v. Cobb, 208 F.3d 212 (6th Cir. 2000) (“De minimis events simply \ndo not state constitutional claims”). \nFinally, Plaintiff cannot state a free-exercise claim based on the conclusory allegation that \nthe nondiscrimination policy represents “a system of individualized assessments.”  Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1498, ¶ 337.  Plaintiff does not allege that Shawnee has ever, or will ever, grant \nany exemption from its policy that transgender students must be treated in conformance with their \ngender identity.  See Kissinger, 5 F.3d at 179 (finding that plaintiff failed to show that the school \nhad a system of exemptions that allowed students to graduate without completing the required \nsurgical coursework).  To the extent Plaintiff is referring to the fact that Shawnee performs an \nindividualized investigation before deciding whether a faculty member has violated university \npolicy, the Free Exercise Clause does not prohibit Shawnee from giving its professors due process. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 19 of 23  PAGEID #: 1992\nIII.  Plaintiff’s State Free Exercise Claim Must Be Dismissed.  \n \nPlaintiff’s free exercise claim under Article I, § 7 of the Ohio Constitution (Count Eight) \nalso fails as a matter of law.  First, the state law claim is foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment. \nSee Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Def. Mot. to Dismiss, \nDoc. 22, at PageID 583-584.  Even if Pennhurst does not apply, the Court should still decline to \nexercise its supplemental jurisdiction over this state law claim if all federal law claims are \ndismissed.  Gamel v. City of Cincinnati, 625 F.3d 949, 952 (6th Cir. 2010) (“When all federal \nclaims are dismissed before trial, the balance of considerations usually will point to dismissing the \nstate law claims.” (internal citation omitted)). \nIt would be particularly appropriate to decline supplemental jurisdiction here, given that \nno Ohio case has applied Article I, § 7 of the Ohio Constitution in analogous circumstances.  The \nOhio Supreme Court has held that a prison guard had the state constitutional right to wear his hair \nlong for religious reasons even if this violates a generally applicable grooming policy.  Humphrey \nv. Lane, 728 N.E.2d 1039, 1043 (Ohio 2000).  In that context, the court applied the rule that “the \nstandard for reviewing a generally applicable, religion-neutral state regulation that allegedly \nviolates a person’s right to free exercise of religion is whether the regulation serves a compelling \nstate interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.”  Id.  But this case presents \na very different scenario.  In Humphrey, the plaintiff did his job as dictated by the state—he simply \nwanted to wear his hair long while doing so.  Here, Plaintiff seeks to discriminate in the exercise \nof his state-conferred authority.  Supra, at Part I.A.1.  Thus, Plaintiff is analogous to a prison guard \nwho argues that the state constitution protects his right to discriminate against transgender inmates \nbecause this is required by his religious beliefs.  The Ohio Supreme Court should have the chance \nto consider this unprecedented claim in the first instance. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 20 of 23  PAGEID #: 1993\nEven if the state-law claim were properly before this Court, it would lack merit.  Even \nassuming the compelling-state-interest test of Humphrey applies here, the state satisfied it as a \nmatter of law: the state has a compelling state interest in preventing discrimination against \ntransgender students, and the nondiscrimination policy is the least restrictive means of achieving \nthat policy.  Supra, Part I.C.  Further, even if the enforcement of Shawnee’s nondiscrimination \npolicies violated Article I, § 7, the application of Article I, § 7 would be preempted by Title IX.  \nAs explained above, federal law requires Shawnee to maintain a nondiscrimination policy that \nensures that transgender students are treated by their professors in accordance with their gender \nidentity.  Supra, Part I.C.  Any state law that prevents Shawnee from enforcing Title IX stands as \nan “obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” \nbecause it is impossible for Shawnee to comply with both federal law (Title IX) and state law (the \nstate Free Exercise Clause).  Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372–73 (2000).   \nIV.  Plaintiff’s Remaining Claims Lack Merit. \n \nDue Process.  Plaintiff’s due process claim (Count Six) must be dismissed because \nShawnee’s nondiscrimination policy is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Due Process Clause \nrequires “sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited \nand in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,” Kolender v. \nLawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983), though it does not require legislating in “encyclopedic terms.”  \nUnited States v. Jenkins, 770 F.3d 507, 510 (6th Cir. 2014).   \nPlaintiff has not plausibly alleged that the nondiscrimination policy is unconstitutionally \nvague on its face.  The policy is crystal clear: all students, transgender or not, must be treated in \naccordance with their gender identity.  The policy is also not vague as applied to Plaintiff: \nPlaintiff’s own factual allegations show that Shawnee has clearly communicated what the policy \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 21 of 23  PAGEID #: 1994\nrequired multiple times and that Plaintiff was on notice.  In August 2016, over a year before Ms. \nDoe started taking his class, faculty members of the University were informed that they could face \ndisciplinary action if “they refused to use a student’s requested name or pronoun.” Am. Compl., \nDoc. 34, at PageID 1472, ¶ 107.  In October 2016, Defendant Milliken personally informed \nPlaintiff  that  the  nondiscrimination  policies  meant  that  professors  must  utilize  a  student’s \nrequested pronoun, “regardless of the professor’s convictions or views.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at \nPageID 1472, ¶ 112.  Defendant Milliken then personally informed Plaintiff that he would be \n“subject to administrative disciplinary procedures if he refused to use a pronoun that reflects a \nstudent’s self-asserted gender identity.”  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 16, ¶ 114.  This same \ninterpretation of the policy was communicated to Plaintiff again in 2018, during the disciplinary \nprocess.  Am. Compl., Doc. 34, at PageID 1483, ¶ 215.  Thus, the University enforced the policy \nin a clear, non-arbitrary manner, and Plaintiff was given ample notice as to what it required.   \nEqual protection.  Plaintiff’s equal protection claim (Count Seven) must be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiff failed to allege any disparate treatment.  “The threshold element of an equal \nprotection claim is disparate treatment; once disparate treatment is shown, the equal protection \nanalysis to be applied is determined by the classification used by government decision-makers.”  \nScarbrough v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 470 F.3d 250, 260 (6th Cir. 2006).  Here, Plaintiff has \nnot alleged that any other professor at the University refused to call on students according to their \ngender identity but was not disciplined for doing so; nor has Plaintiff alleged that Shawnee failed \nto discipline other professors at the University who violated the nondiscrimination policy.5 \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiff’s amended complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.  \n \n                                                 \n5 Ms. Doe and SAGA adopt the State’s arguments regarding Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim (Count Nine).   \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 44 Filed: 05/10/19 Page: 22 of 23  PAGEID #: 1995\nDate: May 10, 2019        Respectfully Submitted, \n \n            /s/ Adam G.

Simultaneously with this motion, Jane \nDoe also moves to proceed pseudonymously.   \n1.  Jane Doe is the transgender student at the center of this lawsuit.  Ms. Doe’s \ncomplaint about Professor Meriwether’s differential treatment of her because she is transgender \nprecipitated the investigation and disciplinary action Meriwether alleges violates his legal rights.   \n2.  SAGA is a student-led organization at Shawnee State University founded in 2009.  \nThe organization is dedicated to promoting diversity and understanding by giving a voice to the \nLGBTQ students at Shawnee.  SAGA furthers its mission by hosting educational programming \nand activities on campus, and advocating that Shawnee adopt and enforce policies that create a \nsafe and welcoming learning environment for all students, including LGBTQ students. \n3.  Ms. Doe and SAGA seek to intervene to help protect the policies and practices \nthat ensure transgender students at Shawnee have equal access to the educational opportunities at \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 2 of 18  PAGEID #: 489\n \nShawnee and highlight the harms caused by Professor Meriwether’s conduct through the stories \nof transgender students, including Ms. Doe and other transgender members of SAGA. \n4.  Ms. Doe and SAGA seek to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24(a) or, alternatively, permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n24(b). \n5.  Ms. Doe and SAGA satisfies all requirements for intervention of right under Rule \n24(a): The motion to intervene is timely, Ms. Doe and SAGA have substantial legal interests in \nthis case, denial of this motion to intervene would impair Ms. Doe’s legal interests as well as \nthose of SAGA’s transgender members, and although Ms. Doe and SAGA share the same goal—\ndismissal of Meriwether’s claims—with the existing Defendants, Shawnee will not make the \nsame arguments as Ms. Doe and SAGA in defending against those claims.    \n6.  Permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) would also be appropriate because Ms. \nDoe and SAGA seek to advance defenses that share common questions of law and fact with the \nmain action.  Here, Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to argue that, as a matter of law, Shawnee’s \npolicies and conduct are consistent with the First Amendment and state law.  Similarly, if this \ncase proceeds to discovery, Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to demonstrate the significant harm \nProfessor Meriwether has caused Ms. Doe and other transgender students on campus.  \n7.  Ms. Doe and SAGA submit a conditional answer, attached as Exhibit 1, in order \nto comply with Rule 24(c), but intend to separately seek to dismiss Meriwether’s complaint, \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), as each of his claims fail to state a cause of action as a matter of law. \n8.

Ms. Doe is at the center of this case.  \nProfessor  Meriwether’s  suit  alleges  that  Shawnee  State  University  (“Shawnee”)  improperly \nrequired him to use female pronouns in addressing a transgender female student; Ms. Doe is that \nstudent.  SAGA is a student organization at Shawnee that advocates for LGBT students.  Its \nmembers include Ms. Doe and other transgender students.  Thus, this case will determine how \nMs. Doe and other similarly situated SAGA members will be treated by their university.  Ms. \nDoe and SAGA seek to intervene on Shawnee’s side; they do not intend to pursue affirmative \nclaims in this case.  This Court should permit Ms. Doe and SAGA to intervene as of right \nbecause their significant legal interests will not be adequately represented by the current parties, \nor alternatively, grant permissive intervention because the defenses Ms. Doe and SAGA intend \nto raise share common questions of law and fact with the underlying case.  \n \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 5 of 18  PAGEID #: 492\n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nJane Doe is a young transgender woman and has been living as female in all aspects of \nher life for over five years.  (Doe Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8-10.)  Over that time, she has legally changed her \nname and corrected her identity documents to accurately reflect her female identity.  (Doe Decl. \n¶ 9.) \nMs. Doe enrolled at Shawnee beginning in the Spring 2017 semester, four years after her \ngender transition.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 10.)  She is listed as female in her student records and treated as \na female student  by Shawnee in all respects.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 10.)  During the Spring 2018 \nsemester, Ms. Doe enrolled in Professor Meriwether’s Political Philosophy course because the \ncourse fulfilled a general education requirement and she was interested in the subject.  (Doe \nDecl. ¶ 12.)  Prior to this class, Ms. Doe had never met or interacted with Professor Meriwether.  \n(Doe Decl. ¶ 12.) \nOn the first day of class, January 9, 2018, Ms. Doe raised her hand to participate in the \nclass discussion and Professor Meriwether incorrectly referred to Ms. Doe as “sir.”  (Doe Decl. \n¶ 14.)  Not wanting to call too much attention to herself, Ms. Doe decided not to correct \nProfessor Meriwether at that time.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 13.)  After class, Ms. Doe approached Professor \nMeriwether and informed him that she is a woman and asked that he use female honorifics.  \nProfessor Meriwether refused.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 14.)  Ms. Doe showed Professor Meriwether her \ndriver’s license, which states that Ms. Doe is a female and confirms that Ms. Doe is legally \nrecognized as female by the State of Ohio.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 14.)  But Professor Meriwether \ncontinued to insist on using male honorifics.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 14.) \nMs.  Doe’s  interaction  with  Professor  Meriwether  led  to  a  cascade  of  negative \nconsequences for Ms. Doe, both in and outside of Professor Meriwether’s class.  She dreaded \nparticipating in Professor Meriwether’s class because of his refusal to use the correct gender \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 6 of 18  PAGEID #: 493\n \nhonorifics for her, but felt compelled to continue participating because Professor Meriwether \ngrades students on class participation.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 18.)  She also was concerned that her \nclassmates  would  notice  and  take  cues  from  the  differential  treatment  she  received  from \nProfessor Meriwether.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 19.)  Indeed, on several occasions, her classmates copied \nProfessor Meriwether’s incorrect use of honorifics and pronouns for Ms. Doe, mistakenly using \nmale honorifics and pronouns.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 19.) \nBeing  singled  out  and  treated  disrespectfully  also  caused  Ms.  Doe  significant \npsychological strain and distress, including an increase in both the severity and duration of her \ngender dysphoria.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 20.)  She had regular crying spells outside of class and was in a \nconstant state of emotional exhaustion.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 20.)  That exhaustion in turn caused her to \nwithdraw from friends and social activities that she previously enjoyed.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 20.) \nA few weeks after her initial interaction with Professor Meriwether, Ms. Doe reported \nProfessor Meriwether’s discriminatory mistreatment to Douglas Shoemaker, the Deputy Title IX \nCoordinator at Shawnee.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 16.)  Shortly thereafter, Ms. Doe was informed that \nShawnee  was  investigating  her  complaint,  and  she  provided  a  statement  as  part  of  the \ninvestigation.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 16.) \nMs. Doe is a member of SAGA, a student-led organization at Shawnee that advocates for \nand engages in public education efforts on issues affecting LGBT people.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 17; \nKeniston Decl. ¶¶ 3, 8-10.)  SAGA regularly meets with administrators at Shawnee to discuss the \nneeds and concerns of its members, which include Ms. Doe and other transgender students, \nparticularly when specific issues or incidents arise.  (Keniston Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12.)  SAGA also \nadvocates for Shawnee to adopt and implement policies that promote the health and well-being \nof its LGBT members and all LGBT students at the university, including fostering a safe and \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 7 of 18  PAGEID #: 494\n \nwelcoming learning environment.  (Keniston Decl. ¶ 9.)  SAGA complements that advocacy with \npublic education and social events on campus to inform the community about issues affecting \nLGBT people, including the importance of referring to transgender people by their correct name \nand pronouns as well as the harms caused by not doing so.  (Keniston Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.)  After Ms. \nDoe shared her experience with some of her peers at SAGA, SAGA met with Christina Jones, \nCoordinator of the Women’s & Gender Equity Center at Shawnee, and Tiffany Hartman, the \nDirector of Student Life, to express the concerns of their members that transgender students were \nbeing mistreated by Professor Meriwether and to ensure that Shawnee understood this was an \nimportant issue for transgender students and should be taken seriously.  (Keniston Decl. ¶¶ 10-\n12.)   \nProfessor Meriwether’s actions have limited the courses that Ms. Doe and SAGA’s other \ntransgender members are willing to take.  (Keniston Decl. ¶ 13.)  Ms. Doe would have taken \nother classes with Professor Meriwether because she is interested in the courses he teaches, but \nnow will only consider doing so if Professor Meriwether refers to her by the correct honorifics.  \n(Doe Decl. ¶ 22.)  Likewise, other transgender members of SAGA will be deterred from taking \nProfessor Meriwether’s courses if he mistreats transgender students as he mistreated Ms. Doe.  \n(Keniston Decl. ¶ 13.)  Some of SAGA’s transgender members, however, may not be able to \navoid registering for a class with Professor Meriwether because he regularly teaches “Ethics in \nPublic/Private Life,” one of only three classes that fulfills Shawnee’s graduation requirement in \nthe category of Ethical Insight & Reasoning.  (Keniston Decl. ¶ 14.)   \nShawnee concluded its investigation of Professor Meriwether’s mistreatment of Ms. Doe \nin May 2018.  (Compl. ¶ 214 & Ex. 13.)  Based on the findings of that investigation, Shawnee \ndecided to issue a written warning to Professor Meriwether for his conduct.  (Compl. ¶ 235 & \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 8 of 18  PAGEID #: 495\n \nEx.  20.)    On  November  5,  2018,  Professor  Meriwether  sued  Shawnee  seeking  a  judicial \ndeclaration that Shawnee cannot discipline him for discriminating against transgender students. \nIn response, a small group of faculty have expressed support for Professor Meriwether.  \n(Doe Decl. ¶ 23.)  Ms. Doe and the other transgender members of SAGA are increasingly \nconcerned that other professors may start mistreating transgender students or otherwise create a \nhostile environment for transgender students in their classes.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 23; Keniston Decl. \n¶ 15.)  In fact, Ms. Doe already dropped a course for next semester, deciding instead to take that \nclass when it is taught by a professor that has not publicly supported Professor Meriwether’s \nunwillingness to comply with Shawnee’s policy.  (Doe Decl. ¶ 23.) \nARGUMENT \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 establishes two avenues for a party to intervene in \npending litigation: intervention of right or permissive intervention.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)-(b).  \n“Rule 24 should be broadly construed in favor of potential intervenors.”   Stupak-Thrall v. \nGlickman, 226 F.3d 467, 472 (6th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nIn this case, Ms. Doe and SAGA seek to intervene on the side of Shawnee.  They do not \nseek  to  pursue  any  affirmative  claims  for  relief.    Ms.  Doe  and  SAGA  readily  satisfy  the \nrequirements for both intervention of right and permissive intervention.  \nA.  Ms. Doe and SAGA are entitled to intervene as defendants as of right. \nTo intervene as of right, a proposed intervenor must establish “(1) timeliness of the \napplication to intervene, (2) the applicant’s substantial legal interest in the case, (3) impairment \nof the applicant’s ability to protect that interest in the absence of intervention, and (4) inadequate \nrepresentation of that interest by parties already before the court.”  Mich. State AFL-CIO v. \nMiller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1245 (6th Cir. 1997).  Ms. Doe and SAGA meet those requirements. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 9 of 18  PAGEID #: 496\n \nFirst, this motion is timely.  Whether a motion to intervene is timely is evaluated in light \nof  five  factors:  “1)  the  point  to  which  the  suit  has  progressed;  2)  the  purpose  for  which \nintervention is sought; 3) the length of time preceding the application during which proposed \nintervenors knew or should have known of their interest in the case; 4) the prejudice to the \noriginal parties due to the proposed intervenors’ failure to promptly intervene after they knew or \nreasonably should have known of their interest in the case; and 5) the existence of unusual \ncircumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.”  Blount-Hill v. Zelman, 636 F.3d \n278, 284 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir. 1990) \n(quotation marks omitted)).  Here, Ms. Doe and SAGA diligently filed their intervention motion \nonly six weeks after the complaint was filed, and before Shawnee’s deadline for answering or \nmoving to dismiss.  Given that discovery has not yet begun, there is no possibility of prejudice.  \nThus, the motion is plainly timely.  Indeed, courts within this Circuit routinely grant intervention \nto parties who sought to intervene at later points in the litigation.1   \nSecond, both Ms. Doe and SAGA have a “substantial legal interest” in this case.  Both \nthe Sixth Circuit and a court in this District have found the requisite substantial legal interest \nunder Rule 24 on closely similar facts to this case.  In Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394 (6th \nCir. 1999), white students sued the University of Michigan and its law school, alleging their \nrace-conscious admissions policies violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 396-97.  Students \nwho were potential beneficiaries of the race-conscious admissions policies, as well as pro-\naffirmative action organizations, moved to intervene.  Id. at 397.  The court held that the \nproposed intervenors had a right to intervene under Rule 24(a).  It explained that “in this circuit \n                                                 \n1   See, e.g. Morelli v. Morelli, No. 2:00–CV–988, 2001 WL 99859, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 1, \n2001) (two months); Ind. Ins. Co. v. Midwest Maint., No. C–3–99–351, 2000 WL 987829, at \n*2 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 7, 2000) (three months); Hubbard v. Elec. Arts, Inc., No. 2:09–CV–233, \n2011 WL 3469118 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 5, 2011) (“several” months). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 10 of 18  PAGEID #: 497\n \nwe subscribe to a rather expansive notion of the interest sufficient to invoke intervention as of \nright.”  Id. at 398 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It further held that “Rule 24(a)(2)” does \nnot “require[] a specific legal or equitable interest.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  It concluded \nthat the proposed intervenors’ “specific interest in the subject matter of this case, namely their \ninterest in gaining admission to the University,” was a “substantial legal interest” for purposes of \nRule 24.  Id.   \nLikewise, in Board of Education of the Highland Local School District v. United States \nDepartment of Education (“Highland”), No. 2:16-CV-524, 2016 WL 4269080 (S.D. Ohio Aug. \n15, 2016), a school refused to allow a transgender girl to use the same restrooms used by other \nfemale students.  The Department of Education concluded that the school violated Title IX, \nprecipitating the school’s lawsuit against the Department.  Id. at *2.  The court granted the \nstudent’s motion to intervene, finding that the student’s “interest in being treated in a non-\ndiscriminatory  manner  by  her  school . . . easily  satisfied”  the  requirement  of  showing  a \nsubstantial interest.  Id. at *3. \nMs. Doe is similarly situated to the intervenors in Grutter and Highland.  Precisely like \nthe intervenors in Grutter, Ms. Doe is the beneficiary of a university policy that the plaintiff \nchallenges  in  a  lawsuit  against  the  university,  and  seeks  to  intervene,  on  the  side  of  the \nuniversity, in order to defend the constitutionality of its policy.  Indeed, Ms. Doe’s interest is \nmore concrete than the interest of the proposed intervenors in Grutter—unlike those intervenors, \nwho merely hypothetically stood to benefit from the university’s affirmative action policy, Ms. \nDoe is the very individual whose interests are put at stake by Professor Meriwether’s complaint.  \nLikewise, Ms. Doe is similarly situated to the intervenor in Highland:  she is a transgender \nstudent who asserts an interest in being treated in a non-discriminatory manner. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 11 of 18  PAGEID #: 498\n \nSAGA, too, has a substantial interest in this lawsuit.  SAGA is not required to establish \nits Article III standing in order to intervene, given that it does not seek any relief beyond what \nShawnee seeks: dismissal of this suit.  Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, \n1651 (2017) (“[A]n intervenor of right must have Article III standing in order to pursue relief \nthat is different from that which is sought by a party with standing.”); Grutter, 188 F.3d at 398 \n(“[A]n  intervenor  need  not  have  the  same  standing  necessary  to  initiate  a  lawsuit.”).  \nNevertheless, SAGA does have standing.  “An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of \nits members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the \ninterests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor \nthe relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Friends of \nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC) Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000).  Ms. Doe and \nother transgender students who are being constructively excluded from Professor Meriwether’s \nclasses have standing in their own right; the interests at stake are directly germane to SAGA’s \npurpose of supporting transgender students on campus; and the relief requested—dismissal of \nProfessor Meriwether’s suit—does not require the participation of an individual student.   \nBecause  SAGA’s  interests  mirror  Ms.  Doe’s  interests,  SAGA  has  the  requisite \n“substantial interest” in this case as well.  In Grutter, the court held that not only students, but \nalso a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving opportunities for minority students, had a \nright  to  intervene.    188  F.3d  at  397.    As  the  Sixth  Circuit  subsequently  explained,  the \norganization had argued, as  its basis for intervention,  “that  its members would be directly \naffected by the outcome of the litigation.”  Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 501 \nF.3d 775, 783 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Grutter, 188 F.3d at 397).  Thus, the organization, “by \nvirtue of its minority members, enunciated a specific interest in the subject matter of the case.”  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 12 of 18  PAGEID #: 499\n \nId.  (internal  quotation  marks  and  alterations  omitted).    SAGA  is  similarly  situated  to  the \norganization that intervened in Grutter—by virtue of its transgender members, SAGA has a \nspecific interest in this case. \nThird, denying Ms. Doe and SAGA’s request to intervene would impair their respective \ninterests.  “To satisfy this element of the intervention test, a would-be intervenor must show only \nthat impairment of its substantial legal interest is possible if intervention is denied. This burden is \nminimal.”  Grutter, 188 F.3d at 399.  For instance, in Grutter, the court held that the reduction of \n“access to the University” for minority students was “more than sufficient to meet the minimal \nrequirements of the impairment element.”  Id. at 400 (quotation marks omitted).  Likewise, in \nHighland, the court held that the possibility that a ruling in the district’s favor would prevent the \ntransgender student from asserting her own constitutional and statutory rights was sufficient to \nestablish impairment.  2016 WL 4269080, at *3.  Here, as in Grutter, Ms. Doe and other SAGA \nmembers face the prospect of a court order invalidating a university policy that protects their \nrights,  leading  to  mistreatment  by  Professor  Meriwether  and  potentially  other  professors.  \nFurther, as in Highland, a victory for Professor Meriwether would inhibit Ms. Doe and other \nSAGA members from pursuing their own claims in a future case that Professor Meriwether’s \nconduct violates Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause, or applicable disability discrimination \nlaws.  Thus, Ms. Doe and SAGA satisfy the impairment requirement. \nFourth, Shawnee will not adequately represent Ms. Doe’s and SAGA’s interests in this \ncase.  To establish a right to intervene, “the proposed intervenors are not required to show that \nrepresentation will in fact be inadequate.”  Grutter, 188 F.3d at 400 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “Indeed, [i]t may be enough to show that the existing party who purports to seek the \nsame  outcome  will  not  make  all  of  the  prospective  intervenor’s  arguments.”    Id.  (internal \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 13 of 18  PAGEID #: 500\n \nquotation  marks  omitted).    “[T]he  proposed  intervenors’  burden  in  showing  inadequacy  is \nminimal,” and “[t]he proposed intervenors need show only that there is a potential for inadequate \nrepresentation.”    Id.  (emphasis  added).    For  instance,  in  Grutter,  the  court  held  that  the \ndefendants’ prediction that “the University is unlikely to present evidence of past discrimination \nby the University itself or of the disparate impact of some current admissions criteria” was \nsufficient to show inadequacy.  Id. at 401.  \nHere, there is at least a potential for inadequate representation.  Shawnee is Professor \nMeriwether’s employer and, as a result, has significantly different interests and motivations in \nthis case than Ms. Doe and SAGA.  Seeking to limit its legal liability, Shawnee will defend its \nauthority to enforce antidiscrimination policies, like the one at issue in this case.  But that same \ninterest—limiting its legal liability—also gives Shawnee an incentive to disclaim any legal \nobligation  to  maintain  and  implement  antidiscrimination  policies  that  protect  transgender \nstudents.  Concretely, Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to argue that disparate treatment of students \nsolely because they are transgender is barred by Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause, and \ndisability discrimination laws.  This is relevant to whether Shawnee has articulated a legitimate \nbasis for its policy for purposes  of First  Amendment  balancing; it  may also establish that \nProfessor Meriwether may not pursue his state-law claims to the extent they conflict with federal \nlaw.  Shawnee, however, may be reluctant to advance these arguments, given that it would be the \ndefendant in any Title IX, Equal Protection Clause, or disability discrimination claim concerning \ntreatment of transgender students.   \nAt a minimum, the parties’ arguments are likely to have a different focus, given that \nShawnee is a public entity and the proposed intervenors are not.  Both the Sixth Circuit and \ncourts in this District have consistently held that the possibility that a private intervenor may \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 14 of 18  PAGEID #: 501\n \nmake different arguments from a governmental litigant was sufficient to establish inadequate \nrepresentation.  Mich. State AFL-CIO, 103 F.3d at 1247 (“One would expect that the Chamber, \nas a target of the statutes’ regulations, would harbor an approach and reasoning for upholding the \nstatutes that will differ markedly from those of the state, which is cast by the statutes in the role \nof  regulator.”);  Allied  Constr.  Indus.  v.  City  of  Cincinnati,  No.  1:14-CV-450,  2014  WL \n11429028, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 24, 2014) (“[I]t is not difficult to imagine that the private \ninterests of Local 265 and its members may diverge with the public interests of the City”); \nOrrand v. Hunt Constr. Grp., Inc., No. 2:13–CV–481, 2014 WL 3895555, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Aug. \n8, 2014) (because non-governmental intervenor had “private economic concerns which are not \nshared by the NLRB,” and “the NLRB represents and enforces the public interest,” “the NLRB's \nperspective differs from that of the parties to this action”).  Here, Shawnee will emphasize a \npublic university’s right to control the conduct of its employees.  Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to \nmake that argument as well, but they would also emphasize the specific harms of Professor \nMeriwether’s conduct to transgender students—a perspective they are ideally situated to offer.  \nThe prospect that they will make different arguments from Shawnee is sufficient to establish \ninadequate representation. \nFinally, the Court should permit both Ms. Doe and SAGA to intervene, because SAGA \nhas a continuing interest in defending the rights of transgender students on campus even after \nMs. Doe graduates.  Although Ms. Doe and SAGA believe this case presents pure issues of law \nthat should be resolved at the motion to dismiss stage, there is at least the possibility that the case \nwill not have concluded by Ms. Doe’s expected graduation in May 2021.  At that point, however, \nProfessor Meriwether or the University may argue that the case has become moot with respect to \nMs. Doe.  Permitting SAGA to intervene will ensure that transgender students at Shawnee have a \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 15 of 18  PAGEID #: 502\n \nvoice in this case until its conclusion.  See Franklin Cent. Gay/Straight All. v. Franklin Tp. Cmty. \nSch. Corp., IP01–1518 C–M/S, 2002 WL 31921332, at *2 (S.D. Ind.

Ms. Doe and SAGA also meet the standard for permissive intervention. \nPursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  24,  the  Court  “may  permit  anyone  to \nintervene” who has a claim or defense that shares a common question of law or fact with the \nmain action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).  Permissive intervention lies in the sound discretion of \nthe  trial  court,  and  courts  in  this  district  have  exercised  their  discretion  liberally  to  grant \npermissive intervention.2  In Highland, for instance, the court held in the alternative that the \ntransgender student met the standard for permissive intervention, finding that her claims raised \ncommon questions of law and fact and her intervention would promote judicial economy.  2016 \nWL 4269080, at *4; see also Order, Doe v.

Ohio Feb. 20, \n2007). \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 16 of 18  PAGEID #: 503\n \n4945, 2016 WL 3269001 (N.D. Ill. June 15, 2016) (granting transgender students’ motion to \nintervene). \nMs. Doe and SAGA have defenses that share common questions of law and fact with the \nmain action.  Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to argue that the First Amendment and state law permit \nShawnee’s policy as a matter of law.  If this case proceeds to discovery, they intend to argue, as a \nfactual matter, that Professor Meriwether’s conduct is deeply harmful to transgender students on \ncampus.  These arguments will address the core questions of law and fact in this case.  \nMs.  Doe’s  and  SAGA’s  participation  would  also  promote  efficiency  and  judicial \neconomy.    Ms.  Doe  and  SAGA  strongly  believe  that  this  case  should  be  resolved  on  the \npleadings without discovery.  However, if this case proceeds to discovery, there is a strong \nprobability that either party will subpoena Ms. Doe, given that she is at the center of this case.  \nPermitting her to intervene will not delay the case, given that she will likely be required to \nparticipate even without intervention.  Rather, it will allow her to advocate for her own interests \ninstead of being a bystander.   \nC.  The Court Should Permit Ms. Doe and SAGA to Move to Dismiss. \nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  24(c)  states  that  a  motion  to  intervene  must  “be \naccompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.”  \nTo comply with this rule, Ms. Doe and SAGA have filed a proposed Answer as an exhibit. \nHowever, Ms. Doe and SAGA intend to file a motion to dismiss.  If the Court grants their \nmotion to intervene, the Court should afford Ms. Doe and SAGA the opportunity to file a motion \nto dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) before filing their Answer on the \ndocket.   \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 18 Filed: 12/24/18 Page: 17 of 18  PAGEID #: 504\n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Jane Doe and SAGA respectfully request that this Court \nGRANT this Motion to Intervene. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nDated:  December 24, 2018 \n  /s/ Jennifer Branch \n  Jennifer L.

MERIWETHER, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nTHE  TRUSTEES  OF  SHAWNEE  STATE \nUNIVERSITY—Francesca  Hartop, \nJoseph Watson, Scott Williams, David \nFurbee, Sondra Hash, Robert Howarth, \nGeorge White, Wallace Edwards, Brett \nRappold,  and  Leen  Heresh—in  their \nofficial capacities; JEFFREY A. BAUER, \nInterim  President,  Provost,  and  Vice \nPresident  of  Academic  Affairs  at \nShawnee State University, in his official \ncapacities; ROBERTA MILLIKEN, Acting \nCase No:  ___________________________ \nDean of the College of Arts & Sciences at \nShawnee State University, in her official \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED \ncapacities; JENNIFER PAULEY, Chair of \nthe  Department  of  English  and \nHumanities  at  Shawnee  State \nUniversity,  in  her  official  capacities; \nTENA PIERCE, Title IX Coordinator at \nShawnee State University, in her official \ncapacities;  DOUGLAS  SHOEMAKER, \nDeputy Title IX Coordinator at Shawnee \nState  University,  in  his  official \ncapacities;  and  MALONDA  JOHNSON, \nDirector  of  Human  Resources  and \nDeputy Title IX Coordinator at Shawnee \nState  University,  in  her  official \ncapacities,  \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFF’S VERIFIED COMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Nicholas K. Meriwether, by and through counsel, and for his Verified \nComplaint against Defendants, hereby states as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The cornerstone of higher education is the ability of professors to participate \nfreely in the “marketplace of ideas,” where all viewpoints can be heard and debated \non  their  merits.  That  marketplace  depends  on  free  and  vigorous  debate  among \nprofessors and students, a debate that is often reflected in an individual speaker’s \nchoice of rhetoric. But at campuses throughout the country, this marketplace of ideas \n1 \n\n \nis under attack. All too often, university officials—including those at Shawnee State \nUniversity (“University”)—use a myriad of different policies to silence, censor, and \nrestrict those who express ideas to which they or others object. \n2.  Seeking to participate in this marketplace, Dr. Nicholas Meriwether became \na philosophy professor at the University. As such, he desires to help students seek \nknowledge, wisdom, and truth; to challenge them to think deeply and critically about \nthe issues of the day; and to gain a more accurate and thoughtful perspective on \nhuman nature, how we should live, and how we should govern ourselves. In the \nprocess, he presents his own views on these issues and communicates consistently \nwith them.  \n3.  In January 2018, a male student demanded that Dr. Meriwether address him \nas a woman because he identified as such and threatened to have Dr. Meriwether \nfired if he declined. To accede to these demands would have required Dr. Meriwether \nto communicate views regarding gender identity that he does not hold, that he does \nnot wish to communicate, and that would contradict (and force him to violate) his \nsincerely held Christian beliefs. Thus, he declined but offered to use whatever proper \nname the student preferred to accommodate this student and to make him feel as \ncomfortable as possible without violating his own deeply-held beliefs and convictions. \n4.  Unsatisfied, the student complained to the University. Rather than allowing \nthe student and Dr. Meriwether to communicate their views as they each chose, the \nUniversity sought to silence Dr. Meriwether and punished him for expressing views \nthat  differ  from  its  own  orthodoxy  and  for  declining  to  express  its  mandated \nideological message. Continuing in their role as the self-appointed grammar police, \nDefendants threaten to punish him again if he continues to express his views. Under \ntheir policies, all professors must refer to each student—both in and out of class—\nusing whatever pronouns the student claims reflect his gender identity. They demand \nthis even though the concept of gender identity is entirely subjective and fluid, even \n2 \n\n \nthough the number of potential gender identities is infinite (with over one hundred \ndifferent  options  currently available),  and even  though the  number of  potential \npronouns has likewise multiplied in recent years—all for the purpose of lending \ncredence to cultural ideas Dr. Meriwether does not share or wish to advance.  \n5.  Defendants have retaliated against Dr. Meriwether for exercising his First \nAmendment rights, have violated his First Amendment rights to free speech and free \nexercise of religion, have violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, have \ndeprived him of due process and equal protection of law, have denied him his right to \nexercise his religion under the Ohio constitution, and have breached their contract \nwith him. Thus, this action concerns the denial of Dr. Meriwether’s fundamental and \nclearly established rights under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the \nFirst Amendment, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the Due Process and \nEqual Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article I § 7 of the Ohio \nConstitution.  \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n6.  This civil rights action raises federal questions under the United States \nConstitution,  particularly  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments,  and  the  Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over these federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.   \n8.  This Court has authority to award the requested damages pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343; the requested declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02; the \nrequested injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and FED. R. CIV. P. 65; and \ncosts and attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims made \nherein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \n10.  Venue is proper in this district and division pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \n3 \n\n \nand S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 82.1 because Defendants reside in this district and division \nand/or all of the acts described in this Complaint occurred in this district and division. \nPLAINTIFF \n11.

Each and every Defendant is sued in his or her official capacity.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Defendants’ Unconstitutional Nondiscrimination Policies \n53.  Shawnee State University is a public four-year college in the University \nSystem of Ohio and receives funding from the State of Ohio in order to operate. \n54.  University officials are bound by the policies adopted by the Trustee Defend-\nants and the University president. \n55.  Defendants have adopted and enforced a series of policies that govern faculty \nexpression,  including  the  following  (hereinafter  collectively,  “Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies”), portions of which Dr. Meriwether challenges: \na.  Defendants’ Non-Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy, a true, \naccurate, and correct copy of which is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit \n1; and  \nb.  Defendants’  policy  entitled  Reporting  &  Investigating  Sexual  Assault, \nSexual Misconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination, a true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of which is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 2.  \n56.  Dr.  Meriwether  challenges  facially  and  as-applied  the  provisions  of \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies that prohibit and define “gender identity” \ndiscrimination. See infra ¶¶ 59–83. \n57.  The  Trustee  Defendants  approved  and  adopted  the  University’s  Non-\nDiscrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy. See Ex. 1 at 1. \n58.  Defendants’ policy entitled Reporting & Investigating Sexual Assault, Sexual \n8 \n\n \nMisconduct  &  Other  Forms  of  Discrimination  was  approved  by  the  University \npresident. See Ex. 2 at 1.  \n59.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies “serve[] to ensure that there are \nUniversity structures and processes in place that prohibit discrimination against any \nindividual because of . . . gender identity. . . .” Ex. 1 at 1; accord Ex. 2 at 1 (noting \nthat Defendants’ policy entitled Reporting & Investigating Sexual Assault, Sexual \nMisconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination “serves to implement the . . . provisions \nof Policy 5.01 [i.e., Ex. 1]).  \n60.  If Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies are violated, the University “will \ntake steps, whether individual or systemic, to stop the alleged . . . discrimination, \nprevent  its  recurrence,  eliminate  any  hostile  environment,  and  remedy  the \ndiscriminatory effects on the complainant and others.” Ex. 2 at 11 ¶ 17.0.  \n61.  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  define  “sex  and  gender  based \ndiscrimination” to include “[n]egative or adverse treatment based on . . . gender \nidentity . . . and the treatment denies or limits the individual’s ability to obtain the \nbenefits of Shawnee State’s programs or activities.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.3. \n62.  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  define  “gender  identity”  as  a \n“person’s  innermost  concept  of  self  as  male  or  female  or  both  or  neither—how \nindividuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.4. \n63.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies note that “[o]ne’s gender identity can \nbe the same or different than the sex assigned at birth.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.4. \n64.  Under  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies,  students  may  select  any \ngender identity they choose because the selection is based entirely on an individual \nstudent’s subjective feelings.  \n65.  Defendants  claim  that  “[t]here  are  a  wide  range  of  gender  identities, \nincluding  man,  woman,  transgender,  genderqueer,  etc.”  A  true,  accurate,  and \ncomplete  copy  of  the  LGBTQIA  webpage  from  Defendants’  Campus  Counseling \n9 \n\n \nServices Office is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 3.  \n66.  By using the term “genderqueer,” Defendants claim that there are an infinite \nvariety of gender identities because they define this term to mean a person “whose \ngender identity is neither woman or man, both woman and man, somewhere in \nbetween, or is some combination of genders.” Ex. 3 at 4.  \n67.  Defendants note that gender identity is completely subjective, saying that \n“[s]ince gender identity is internal, one’s gender identity is not necessarily visible to \nothers.” Ex. 3 at 4.  \n68.  Currently, some sources say that there are over one hundred different options \nfor one’s gender identity, including ones that “refuse[] to be categorized,” that are \n“affected by mood swings,” or that “change[] depending on which friend you’re with.”1 \n69.  Those sources say that this “is an on-going list of gender identities” and that \neach individual can customize his gender identity by “mix[ing] and match[ing] your \nown prefixes and suffixes to create the identity that best describes you.”2 \n70.  Other sources note that the number of possible gender identities is infinite.3 \n71.  Under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, students may demand that \nprofessors refer to them by any pronoun they choose, from the standard English \npronouns (e.g., “he” or “she”), to the standard pronouns applied in a nonstandard way \n(e.g., “they” used to refer to one person), to those invented within the last few years \n(e.g., “ze,” “zie,” “sie,” “hir,” “hirs,” “zie,” “xe,” “xem,” “xyr,” “xyrs,” “per,” “ve,” “ver,” \n“vis,” “fae,” “faer,” “ae,” “aer,” “e,” “ey,” “em,” “eir,” “eirs,” “tey,” “ter,” “tem,” “ters”),4 \n                                                            \n1   See, e.g., Genderfluid Support, available at http://genderfluidsupport.tumblr.com/ \ngender (last visited Nov. 5, 2018). \n2   Id. \n3   See, e.g., Marco A. Hildalgo, Diane Ehrensaft, et al., The Gender Affirmative \nModel:  What We Know and What We Aim to Learn, 56 HUM. DEV. 285, 288 (2013) \n(advocating  for  “self-acceptance  within  an  infinite  variety  of  authentic  gender \nselves”).  \n4   See, e.g., Univ. of Wis., Milwaukee, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Res.

According  to  some  sources,  the  number  of  possible  pronouns  is  infinite \nbecause “[a]ny combination is possible.”5 \n73.  Under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, professors have two choices \nwhen referring to students:  (1) eliminate all gender-based titles and all pronouns \nwhen speaking to all students, which is impossible, impractical, and unreasonable \ngiven the way professors speak, particularly in classes that feature a lot of class \ndiscussion; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s gender identity, even \nthough that gender identity may change from day to day, may change based on which \nfriends the student is with, or may change based on the student’s mood, among other \npossibilities.  \n74.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies specify that “[s]exual harassment \ncan take two forms—quid pro quo or hostile environment.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶18.6.2. \n75.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies define “hostile environment in the \neducational context” to include “any situation in which there is harassing conduct \nthat limits, interferes with or denies educational benefits or opportunities, from both \na subjective (the complainant’s) and an objective (reasonable person’s) viewpoint.” Ex. \n2 at 12–13 ¶ 18.6.2.2. \n76.  Defendants  use  the  definition  of  “hostile  environment”  from  this  sexual \nharassment provision when assessing claims of gender identity discrimination. \n77.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies specify that the “determination of \nwhether an environment is ‘hostile’ is based on the totality of the circumstances.” Ex. \n2 at 13 ¶ 18.6.2.2. \n78.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies define “gender identity” using such \nelusive and subjective terminology that they give professors no notice as to what \n                                                            \n5   See,  e.g.,  Univ.  of  Cal.,  Davis,  LGBTQIA  Res.

Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  provide  no  objective  guidelines, \nstandards, or criteria for University officials to use when deciding what constitutes \ngender identity or gender identity discrimination, thereby granting those officials \nunbridled discretion to restrict expression.  \n80.  Defendants, by policy and practice, apply their Nondiscrimination Policies to \nregulate the expression of individual faculty members. \n81.  Defendants, by policy and practice, apply their Nondiscrimination Policies to \nregulate all interactions professors have with students, whether in the classroom or \noutside of it.  \n82.  If  a  full-time  faculty  member  violates  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination \nPolicies, he is subject to discipline under the policies outlined in “the article titled \n‘Complaint  Resolution  and  Disciplinary  Process’  in  the  collective  bargaining \nagreement  between  the  University  and  the  Shawnee  Education  Association \n[hereinafter, ‘Union’].” Ex. 2 at 10 ¶ 16.2.1.1. A true, accurate, and complete copy of \nthis Collective Bargaining Agreement is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 4. \n83.  Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, a faculty member who violates \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies is subject to a range of disciplinary actions, \nfrom a “written warning” to immediate “[t]ermination.” Ex. 4 at 110.  \nII.  Defendants’ Enforcement of Their Unconstitutional Policies  \nA. Dr. Meriwether’s Theological Beliefs \n84.  Dr. Meriwether is a professing evangelical Christian and a member of the \nPresbyterian Church of America, who strives to live out his faith on a daily basis.  \n85.  Dr. Meriwether’s Christian faith governs the way he thinks about human \nnature, marriage, gender, sexuality, morality, politics, and social issues, and it causes \nhim to hold sincerely-held religious beliefs in these areas.  \n12 \n\n \n86.  Dr. Meriwether’s convictions concerning human nature, the purpose and \nmeaning of life, and ethical standards that are to govern human conduct are drawn \nfrom the Bible.  \n87.  Dr. Meriwether believes that God created human beings as either male or \nfemale, that this gender is fixed in each person from the moment of conception, and \nthat it cannot be changed, regardless of an individual’s feelings or desires.  \n88.  Dr. Meriwether also believes he cannot affirm as true ideas and concepts that \nare not true, as this would violate Biblical injunctions against dishonesty and lying.  \n89.  Dr. Meriwether also believes that he is required to treat each person with \ndignity, love, and care, as each is an individual created in the image of God.  \n90.  Because of his sincerely held religious beliefs, Dr. Meriwether objects to \ncommunicating  a  University-mandated  ideological  message  regarding  gender \nidentity that he does not believe, that he does not wish to communicate, and that \ncontradicts (and would force him to violate) his sincerely held religious beliefs. \nB. Dr. Meriwether’s Distinguished Career at Shawnee State University \n91.  In  the  fall  of  1996,  Dr.  Meriwether joined the  University faculty  as  an \nassistant professor in the Department of English and Humanities.  \n92.  In  1999,  Dr.  Meriwether  was  promoted  to  associate  professor  at  the \nUniversity and received a continuing contract, which at the time was the same as \nobtaining tenure. \n93.  In 2011, Dr. Meriwether was promoted to full professor at the University.  \n94.  On three separate occasions between 2010 to the present, Dr. Meriwether has \nalso taught philosophy classes in German as a Gastdozent (i.e., guest lecturer) at the \nPädagogische Hochschule in Ludwigsburg, Germany.  \n95.  In  2017,  Dr.  Meriwether  taught  two  courses  in  Berlin,  Germany  with \nWestern Kentucky University’s Kentucky Institute for International Studies.  \n96.  At the University, Dr. Meriwether has focused his scholarship and teaching \n13 \n\n \non the intersection of philosophy, ethics, religion, and political theory. \n97.  As a graduate student, Dr. Meriwether specialized in the areas of ethics, \nsocial and political philosophy, and the history of philosophy. \n98.  At  the  University,  Dr.  Meriwether  teaches  or  has  taught  a  variety  of \nphilosophy courses, including the following:   \na.  Ethics: focusing on human flourishing, natural law, and the split between \npre-modern and modern approaches to ethics; \nb.  Political Philosophy: surveying the great political ideas from Plato to \nRawls, including a survey of Reformation political thought. \nc.  Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: examining the historical engagement \nof the three religions, the question of religious militancy, and apologetical \nissues. \nd.  Ethics and Technology in the 21st Century: focusing on issues of bioethics \nand biotechnology. \ne.  History of Christian Thought: examining the development of Christian \ndoctrine from the early church to the modern period. \nf.  Introduction to Philosophy:  covering the major ideas of Western philoso-\nphy chronologically from Plato to Nietzche, with a special emphasis on the \ndevelopment of modern philosophy from Descartes and Hume to Kant.   \n99.  During his career at the University, Dr. Meriwether has also published at \nleast four scholarly articles and a review essay and presented at a minimum of eleven \nscholarly conferences.  \n100. For the past several years, Dr. Meriwether has been researching and writing \na multi-volume work that examines the intersection of philosophy, ethics, religion, \nand political theory from the standpoint of historic Reformed theology. One volume \nis currently under review for publication as a stand-alone work.  \n101. At  the  University,  Dr.  Meriwether  has  served  on  the  Faculty  Senate \n14 \n\n \n(including serving as its vice president at one time); led multiple study-abroad trips; \ndesigned a baccalaureate degree program in Philosophy and Religion; introduced a \nminor in Philosophy program; served on various committees; and hosted, moderated, \nand spoken at numerous panels and colloquia.  \n102. Over the course of his career, Dr. Meriwether has belonged to the American \nPhilosophical Association, the Society of Christian Philosophers, and the Evangelical \nPhilosophy Society.  \n103. Before the spring of 2018, Dr. Meriwether was never the subject of any \nUniversity disciplinary actions.  \nC. Dr.  Meriwether’s  Unsuccessful  Efforts  in  2016  to  Persuade \nDefendants to Respect First Amendment Rights  \n104. In August 2016, Dr. Meriwether received an e-mail from Union president \nChip Poirot, regarding the U.S. Department of Education’s recent “Dear Colleague” \nletter and how it addressed issues related to transgenderism. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail string is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 5. (In \nFebruary 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education \n“decided to withdraw and rescind” this “Dear Colleague” letter.6) \n105. In these e-mails, Dr. Poirot informed faculty members that they could face \ndisciplinary action from the University if they “refused to use a [student’s] requested \nname or pronoun.” Ex. 5 at 6–7.  \n106. Dr. Poirot also indicated that these restrictions on how professors speak could \napply outside the classroom. Ex. 5 at 7.  \n107. Shortly before October 27, 2016, Dr. Meriwether wrote Defendant Milliken, \nasking  what  University  policies  required  of  faculty  on  issues  related  to  gender \nidentity.  \n                                                            \n6   U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., “Dear Colleage” Letter, Feb. 22, 2017, \navailable  at  https://www.hlregulation.com/files/2017/02/colleague-201702-title-ix1-\n1.pdf (last visited Nov. 5, 2018).  \n15 \n\n \n108. On October 27, 2016, Defendant Milliken visited Dr. Meriwether’s office to \nanswer his questions. \n109. Defendant Milliken stated that Dr. Meriwether must utilize a student’s \npreferred pronoun, regardless of what pronoun the student requested he use and \nregardless of the professor’s convictions or views on the subject.  \n110. Defendant Milliken stated that a professor’s academic freedom and free \nspeech rights has no bearing on whether he must use a pronoun that reflects a \nstudent’s self-asserted gender identity.  \n111. Defendant Milliken stated that a professor could be subject to administrative \ndisciplinary procedures if he refused to use a pronoun that reflects a student’s self-\nasserted gender identity.  \n112. Dr. Meriwether asked whether the University had any policies that outlined \nhow professors must respond to a student’s demand to use a pronoun that reflects \nthat student’s self-asserted gender identity.  \n113. Defendant Milliken stated that the University does not need to have policies \non this subject because students have a right to be referred to by their chosen gender \nand faculty must comply or be disciplined. \n114. Sometime around November 3, 2016, Defendant Pauley discussed issues \nrelated to transgenderism and gender identity with Dr. Meriwether. \n115. During  this  meeting,  Defendant  Pauley  claimed  that  adherents  to  the \nChristian religion are primarily motivated out of fear. \n116. Defendant Pauley also claimed that the Christian doctrines regarding hell \nare harmful and should not be taught and that anyone who believes hell exists should \nnot be allowed to teach these doctrines. \n117. Defendant Pauley also stated that faculty members who adhere to a certain \nreligion should be banned from teaching courses regarding that religion. \n118. Defendant Pauley stated that the purpose of higher education is to liberate \n16 \n\n \nstudents, that religion oppresses students, and thus, the presence of religion in higher \neducation is counterproductive.  \n119. In saying these things, Defendant Pauley exhibited hostility toward Dr. \nMeriwether and his religious beliefs.  \n120. On November 7, 2016, Dr. Meriwether sent Defendant Milliken an e-mail, \nasking to see the University’s written policies on this subject. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 6.  \n121. That same day, Defendant Milliken e-mailed Dr. Meriwether to say “there is \nno formal policy specific to transgender students, faculty, or staff at the [U]niversity. \nHowever, the [U]niversity does have a non-discrimination policy that includes ‘gender \nidentity.’  (See  policy  5.01  and  its  reporting  procedure  5.01:02  [i.e.,  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies].)” Ex. 6 at 1.   \nD. Dr. Meriwether’s Ill-Fated Efforts to Exercise His First Amendment \nRights in 2018 and Defendants’ Initial Reactions  \n122. In January 2018, Dr. Meriwether returned from a semester-long sabbatical \nand began teaching a new set of classes, including Political Philosophy.  \n123. In his classes, Dr. Meriwether regularly calls on students to answer questions \nabout the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions. In any given class \nperiod, Dr. Meriwether may call upon five to ten students, and he calls on all students \nseveral times over the course of a semester. To him, using the Socratic method of \ninstruction is fundamental to teaching philosophy because it helps students learn to \ndefend their positions, allows flawed reasoning to be identified, and increases the \nlevel of engagement with the concepts being taught.  \n124. On  January  9,  2018,  during  the  first  class  of  Political  Philosophy,  Dr. \nMeriwether responded to a question from a student, Alena Bruening, by saying, “Yes, \nsir.” \n125. Dr. Meriwether responded in this fashion because Bruening is male. \n17 \n\n \n126. Since the early 1990s, Dr. Meriwether has referred to all students in his \nclasses by their last names and a title (i.e., “Mr.,” “Ms.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss”) and as “sir” \nor “ma’am.”  \n127. Dr. Meriwether has always used the titles and pronouns that refer to a stu-\ndent’s biological gender. \n128. Dr. Meriwether has never knowingly used feminine titles and pronouns to \nrefer to men or masculine titles and pronouns to refer to women.  \n129. Dr. Meriwether refers to students in this fashion to foster an atmosphere of \nseriousness and mutual respect that is befitting the college classroom. \n130. Dr. Meriwether believes that this formal manner of addressing students \nhelps them view the academic enterprise as a serious, weighty endeavor. \n131. Dr. Meriwether has also found that addressing students in this fashion helps \nthem learn how to accept and discuss in a respectful fashion the different (and often \nopposing) views many of their fellow students hold on controversial issues.  \n132. Dr. Meriwether has found that addressing students in this fashion is an \nimportant pedagogical tool in all of his classes, but especially in Political Philosophy \nwhere  he and students  discuss  many  of the  most  controversial  issues of  public \nconcern.  \n133. After class on January 9, 2018, Bruening approached Dr. Meriwether, stated \nthat he was transgender (i.e., that he identified as female), and demanded that Dr. \nMeriwether refer to him as a woman (i.e., with feminine titles and pronouns).  \n134. After a brief hesitation, Dr. Meriwether responded by saying that he was not \nsure he could comply with Bruening’s demand and that he was not sure students can \ndictate how professors must refer to them.  \n135. At this point, Bruening became belligerent, circling around Dr. Meriwether \nand getting in his face in a threatening fashion. \n136. While doing this, Bruening told Dr. Meriwether, “Then I guess this means I \n18 \n\n \ncan call you a cunt.”   \n137. Before walking away, Bruening promised to see to it that Dr. Meriwether \nwould be fired if he did not accede to Bruening’s demands.  \n138. That afternoon, Dr. Meriwether reported Bruening’s conduct to Defendant \nPauley, who found it and his use of profanity appalling. \n139. Defendant Pauley then relayed her conversation with Dr. Meriwether to Dr. \nMarc Scott, a professor at the University and president of the faculty senate. \n140. The next day, fearing that Bruening would behave belligerently or even \nviolently in class, Dr. Meriwether asked a security guard if security personnel could \nbe in the vicinity when his Political Philosophy class met again on January 11, 2018. \n141. After  hearing  how  Bruening  had  misbehaved,  the  security  officer \nrecommended that Dr. Meriwether report the misbehavior to the Dean of Students. \n142. On January 10, 2018, Dr. Scott e-mailed Defendant Shoemaker, informing \nhim of the Bruening matter and noting that a Title IX complaint was possible. A true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 7.  \n143. Early on the morning of January 11, 2018, Dr. Meriwether reported the \nincident to the Dean of Students via e-mail, copying Defendant Pauley. A true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 8. \n144. Later that morning, the Dean of Students e-mailed Defendant Shoemaker, \ninforming him of the e-mail she had received from Dr. Meriwether.  \n145. That same morning, Defendant Shoemaker met with Bruening, apprised \nDefendant Milliken of Bruening’s complaint, and advised her on how to proceed. \n146. Just  before  noon  on  January  11,  2018,  Defendant  Milliken  visited  Dr. \nMeriwether’s office to discuss this situation. \n147. Defendant Milliken advised Dr. Meriwether to begin referring to all students \nby their last names only and to eliminate all gender references from his expression.  \n148. Dr. Meriwether explained that referring to students by last names alone \n19 \n\n \nwould undermine the serious pedagogical environment he seeks to create because \nthat is the way people refer to one another in junior high or on an athletic team. It is \nnot the way scholars, engaged in a serious, respectful enterprise, refer to one another.  \n149. In addition, it is unreasonable, impractical, and impossible either to remove \nall pronouns from one’s speech when leading class discussions or to keep track of \nwhich pronouns to use for each student, especially when the possible pronoun options \nare so numerous and a student’s preference could change at any time.  \n150. Dr. Meriwether proposed instead that he would continue referring to all of \nhis students as he had for years, but he would accommodate Bruening by referring to \nhim by his last name. \n151. At  the  time,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  she  approved  this \narrangement, though she later changed her mind.  \n152. Meanwhile,  Bruening  continued  to  attend  Dr.  Meriwether’s  Political \nPhilosophy class without incident and frequently contributed to class discussions, \noften one to three times or more per class period.  \n153. On January 25, 2018, Defendant Milliken again visited Dr. Meriwether’s \noffice to discuss the Bruening matter. \n154. Defendant Milliken announced that Bruening was not satisfied with the \naccommodation that Dr. Meriwether had proposed on January 10, 2018 and had \nthreatened to file a Title IX grievance over Dr. Meriwether’s expression.  \n155. Defendant  Milliken  then  explicitly  rejected  the  accommodation  Dr. \nMeriwether proposed on January 10, 2018 (i.e., referring to Bruening by his last name \nonly and referring to all other students the same way Dr. Meriwether had done for \nyears).  \n156. Defendant Milliken threatened Dr. Meriwether, stating that if he did not \ncomply  with  Bruening’s  (and  now  her  own)  demands,  he  would  be  violating \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n20 \n\n \n157. During his February 1, 2018 Political Philosophy class, Dr. Meriwether inad-\nvertently referred to Bruening using the title “Mr.” before immediately correcting \nhimself (i.e., saying something like “Mr. Bruening—I mean, Bruening”). \n158. In early February 2018, Bruening also spoke with Defendant Pierce, indicat-\ning that his complaint had not been resolved and threatened to contact a lawyer if it \nwas not resolved quickly to his satisfaction.  \n159. Defendant Pierce then contacted Defendant Shoemaker so that further action \ncould be taken, and ultimately Defendants agreed that Defendant Milliken should \ntake the next steps.  \n160. On February 12, 2018, Defendant Milliken again visited Dr. Meriwether’s \noffice to see if he had decided how he would proceed in light of their January 25th \nconversation.  \n161. During  this  conversation,  Dr.  Meriwether  asked  Defendant  Milliken  to \nclarify what would be allowed under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. \n162. Specifically, he asked whether he would be complying with those policies if \nhe (1) referred to all students by their self-asserted gender identity and (2) placed a \ndisclaimer in his syllabus, noting that he was doing so under compulsion and setting \nforth his personal and religious beliefs about gender identity. \n163. Defendant Milliken informed Dr. Meriwether that this disclaimer approach \nwould still violate Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n164. Dr.  Meriwether  explained  that  he  was  willing  to  refer  to  Bruening  by \nwhatever legal name he preferred (i.e., first or last) without using any titles but that \nhe was not willing to refer to Bruening as a woman (i.e., with feminine titles or \npronouns). \n165. Dr. Meriwether also explained that he was not willing to stop referring to all \nother students by their last names and gender appropriate titles.  \n166. Defendant Milliken responded by saying, “Well, you know what this means.” \n21 \n\n \n167. In  saying  this,  Defendant  Milliken  threatened  Dr.  Meriwether  with \ndisciplinary action under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n168. During the rest of the semester, Bruening remained in Dr. Meriwether’s \nPolitical Philosophy class. \n169. During  the  rest  of  the  semester,  Dr.  Meriwether  called  on  Bruening \nregularly, allowing him to participate in class discussions on the same basis as any \nother student.  \n170. During the rest of the semester, Bruening participated frequently in class \ndiscussions in Dr. Meriwether’s Political Philosophy class, expressing freely his views \non whatever topic the class was discussing at each given time. \n171. At the end of the semester, Dr. Meriwether awarded Bruening a high grade \nfor the Political Philosophy class, reflecting his very good work in the class and his \nfrequent participation in class discussions. \n172. Throughout the spring 2018 semester, Bruening was never denied any of the \nbenefits of Dr. Meriwether’s Political Philosophy class.  \nE. Defendants’ Unconstitutional Disciplinary Actions & Speech Code \n1.  Defendants Investigate Dr. Meriwether \n173. In short order, Defendant Milliken followed through on her threats, threats \nthat were as old as 2016 and as new as February 12, 2018.  \n174. On February 13, 2018, Defendant Milliken sent Dr. Meriwether a letter \noutlining again her position on this matter. A true, accurate, and complete copy of \nthis letter is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 9. \n175. Defendant Milliken stated that her letter was “a formal notification that you \nare expected to comply with [Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies] by treating all \nstudents the same, irrespective of their gender identity. Ex. 9 at 1.  \n176. Defendant Milliken stated that if Dr. Meriwether continued to refuse to \naccede to Bruening’s demands, “the University may conduct an investigation” and he \n22 \n\n \n“could be subject to informal or formal disciplinary action.” Ex. 9 at 1.  \n177. On February 16, 2018, before Dr. Meriwether even had a chance to respond \nto this letter, Defendant Milliken informed him via e-mail that she had launched a \nformal investigation against him. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this e-mail \nis attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 10.  \n178. Defendant  Milliken  explained  that  she  was  launching  this  formal \ninvestigation because she had received “another complaint from a student in your \nPolitical Philosophy class.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n179. The student Defendant Milliken referenced was Bruening.  \n180. Defendant  Milliken  explained  that  she  was  launching  this  formal \ninvestigation  due  to  “a  potential  violation  of  University  Policy  5.01  REV  [i.e., \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies] that addresses unlawful discrimination and \nharassment.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n181. Defendant Milliken referred the investigation to Defendants Johnson and \nShoemaker. Ex. 10 at 1. \n182. Defendant Milliken then explained that the “potential violation” came in two \nforms. Ex. 10 at 1. \n183. First, Defendant Milliken noted that Dr. Meriwether “continue[d] to address \nthis student differently than others within the class by calling her by her surname \nwhile other students are addressed as Ms. ___ or Mr. ___.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n184. Second, Defendant Milliken noted that Dr. Meriwether continued to use \nmasculine pronouns when referring to Bruening. Ex. 10 at 1. \n185. In launching this formal investigation, Defendant Milliken violated several \nprovisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  \n186. The Collective Bargaining Agreement specifies that “[f]ormal actions shall be \nimposed only for just cause.” Ex. 4 at 110. \n187. The  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  then  outlines  nine  instances  that \n23 \n\n \nqualify as “just cause” for formal disciplinary action. Ex. 4 at 110–11. \n188. None of these nine instances applied to Dr. Meriwether’s expression, and yet \nDefendant Milliken commenced formal disciplinary proceedings anyway. \n189. The Collective Bargaining Agreement outlines professors’ academic freedom \nrights. Ex. 4 at 24. \n190. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes  “[f]reedom  in  their  classroom  when  discussing  subject  matter  that  is \nreasonably related to the relevant course material and established curriculum.” Ex. \n4 at 24. \n191. Many of Dr. Meriwether’s classes, including his Political Philosophy class, \nnaturally  touch on controversial issues, such as questions of ethics and human \nnature. His comments about gender identity are thus reasonably related to his \nteaching and scholarship. \n192. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes the freedom to “[c]hoose . . . pedagogical techniques.” Ex. 4 at 24. \n193. Dr. Meriwether’s manner of addressing students is a pedagogical technique \ndesigned to foster an atmosphere of seriousness and respect that is vital when \ndiscussing such controversial and hotly debated issues as gender identity. It also \ncommunicates his own personal views on these subjects.  \n194. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes the “[f]reedom to . . . speak freely . . . on educational and curricular matters \nand on matters of public concern.” Ex. 4 at 24. \n195. On February 23, 2018, Dr. Meriwether responded via e-mail to Defendant \nMilliken’s February 13th letter and February 16th e-mail. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this response is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 11.  \n196. In his response, Dr. Meriwether noted that he was still evaluating how to \nrespond to the investigation and that he could “ultimately conclude that [he] could \n24 \n\n \nnot comply with [Defendant Milliken’s] directives due to [his] conscience, ethical or \nreligious convictions, or [his] views on free speech.” Ex. 11 at 3–4. \n197. In addition, Dr. Meriwether reminded Defendant Milliken of his sincerely \nheld religious beliefs as a Christian and explained how those beliefs impacted issues \nrelated to gender identity. Ex. 11 at 4. \n198. Dr. Meriwether also summarized the accommodation he had proposed and \nhow Defendant Milliken had rejected it. Ex. 11 at 4. \n199. Dr. Meriwether then inquired whether he would be allowed to refer to all \nstudents  by  their  last  names alone and continue to  use  biologically-appropriate \npronouns, rather than pronouns reflecting a student’s self-asserted gender identity. \nEx. 11 at 4. \n200. Dr. Meriwether explained that he was not sure this accommodation would be \nacceptable to him, as it would undermine the educational environment he strived to \nachieve in his classroom, but he asked if it would comply with University policy. Ex. \n11 at 4.  \n201. On February 26, 2018, Defendant Milliken replied, explaining that under \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, Dr. Meriwether had two choices:  “calling \nevery student in your classes by his/her last name or by his/her first name.” Ex. 11 at \n2. \n202. As Defendant Milliken did not address the use of pronouns, Dr. Meriwether \nreiterated this question on March 1, 2018. Ex. 11 at 1–2. \n203. Specifically, Dr. Meriwether asked:  “Would the policy prevent me from using \nbiologically correct pronouns when referencing other students, as long as I addressed \nthe student in question using first or last name and refrained from using pronouns?” \nEx. 11 at 2. \n204. On March 12, 2018, Defendant Milliken replied:  “Every student needs to be \ntreated the same in all of your classes. In other words, the policy seeks to ensure that \n25 \n\n \nwhat is done for one student is done for all to avoid issues of discrimination. This \nregards names, pronoun usage, and most any other matter.” Ex. 11 at 1.  \n205. In sum, Defendant Milliken indicated that Dr. Meriwether would violate \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policy (1) if he referred to Bruening using masculine \npronouns; or (2) if he stopped using pronouns in reference to Bruening but continued \nto use biologically correct pronouns for all other students; or (3) if he referred to \ntransgender students by their name of choice but continued to refer to all other \nstudents by their last names and titles (i.e., “Mr.,” “Ms.,” “Miss,” or “Mrs.”).  \n206. Thus,  with  respect  to  names,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  Dr. \nMeriwether  had  only  two  choices  if  he  wanted  to  comply  with  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies: (1) stop referring to students by their last names and \ntitles, thereby altering the pedagogical environment in his classroom; or (2) use titles \nthat refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, which would require him to \nviolate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs. \n207. Thus,  with  respect  to  pronouns,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  Dr. \nMeriwether  had  only  two  choices  if  he  wanted  to  comply  with  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination  Policies:    (1)  stop  using  pronouns  altogether,  which  is \nunreasonable and impossible, especially given the Socratic teaching style that he \nuses; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, \nwhich would require him to violate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n208. On the same day, Dr. Meriwether sent a letter to the University’s president \nand Defendant Bauer, asking them to suspend the investigation. A true, accurate, \nand complete copy of this letter is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 12. \n209. In  this  letter,  Dr.  Meriwether  recounted  Bruening’s  demands  and \nthreatening  behavior,  his  efforts  to  reach  an  accommodation  with  Defendant \nMilliken,  and  her  refusal  to  agree  to  any  arrangement  that  would  allow  Dr. \nMeriwether to follow his religious convictions. Ex. 12 at 2–3. \n26 \n\n \n210.  Dr. Meriwether also explained how launching this investigation violated the \nCollective  Bargaining  Agreement,  as  there  was  no  sufficient  basis  for  the \ninvestigation. Ex. 12 at 3.  \n211. Later  that  day,  Defendant  Bauer  responded,  refusing  to  suspend  the \ninvestigation. Ex. 12 at 1. \n212. Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Bauer  consulted  with  the \nUniversity’s president before responding to Dr. Meriwether. \n213. Upon information and belief, Defendant Bauer acted at the instruction or \nwith the approval of the University’s president when he responded to Dr. Meriwether.  \n214. On  April  12,  2018,  Defendant  Johnson  submitted  the  results  of  her \ninvestigation to Defendant Milliken. A true, accurate, and complete copy of her \ninvestigation report, as updated on May 9, 2018, is attached to this Complaint as \nExhibit 13.  \n215. Defendant Johnson’s investigation involved interviewing just four witnesses, \nincluding Bruening and Dr. Meriwether. Ex. 13 at 1–2.  \n216. Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker and their staff never interviewed any \nnon-transgender students from Dr. Meriwether’s class as part of the investigation so \nas to get a more disinterested perspective on the environment in that class.  \n217. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker and their \nstaff interviewed only students that Bruening recommended. \n218. Defendants  Johnson  and  Shoemaker  and  their  staff  never  asked  Dr. \nMeriwether to recommend any potential witnesses they could interview.  \n219. Defendant Johnson concluded that Dr. Meriwether’s “disparate treatment \nhas  created  a  hostile  environment”  for  Bruening,  thereby  violating  both  of \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 13 at 1, 4.  \n220. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker consulted \nwith Defendant Pierce in conducting their investigation and in preparing Defendant \n27 \n\n \nJohnson’s investigation report. \n221. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker acted at \nthe  instruction  or  with  the  approval  of  Defendant  Pierce  in  conducting  their \ninvestigation and in preparing Defendant Johnson’s investigation report.  \n2.  Defendants Formally Charge Dr. Meriwether \n222. On April 18, 2018, Defendant Milliken notified Dr. Meriwether that she was \npursuing a “formal charge” against him. A true, accurate, and complete copy of \nDefendant Milliken’s charge notice is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 14. \n223. In this charge notice, Defendant Milliken explained to Dr. Meriwether that, \naccording to the investigation, “your disparate treatment of the complainant in your \nclass has caused a hostile environment.” Ex. 14 at 1.  \n224. On  April  21,  2018,  Dr.  Meriwether  e-mailed  Defendants  Shoemaker, \nJohnson, and Milliken, requesting additional documentation and correcting factual \ninaccuracies  in  Defendant  Johnson’s  investigation  report.  A  true,  accurate,  and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 15.  \n225. On  May  8,  2018,  Dr.  Meriwether  sent  Defendant  Milliken  an  e-mail \nresponding to a timeline of events included in Defendant Johnson’s investigation \nreport, which he had not received until April 27, 2018. A true, accurate, and complete \ncopy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 16. \n226. In this e-mail, Dr. Meriwether elaborated further on his beliefs regarding \ngender identity, reiterated his objection to being forced to communicate a message he \ndoes not believe and that conflicts with his religious beliefs, and responded to some \nmisleading statements in Defendant Milliken’s timeline. Ex. 16 at 1.  \n227. On May 29, 2018, Defendant Milliken issued a report, setting forth her \nfindings after the formal investigation of Dr. Meriwether. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of her report is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 17.  \n228. In her report, Defendant Milliken concluded that because Dr. Meriwether \n28 \n\n \nrefused  to  refer  to  Bruening  as  a  woman,  he  had  violated  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies. See Ex. 17 at 2 (“Because Dr. Meriwether repeatedly \nrefused to change the way he addressed Ms. Bruening in his class due to his views on \ntransgender people, and because the way he treated Ms. Bruening was deliberately \ndifferent than the way he treated others in his class, I found that he effectively \ncreated  hostile environment for Ms. Bruening. This is a direct violation of Policy No. \n5.01REV.”). \n229. Defendant Milliken recommended punishing Dr. Meriwether by issuing a \nwritten warning. See Ex. 17 at 2 (“[I]n order to ensure a safe educational experience \nfor all students, I propose the formal action of a written warning being placed in Dr. \nMeriwether’s personnel file.”).  \n230. On June 1, 2018, Dr. Meriwether sent Defendant Bauer an e-mail correcting \nDefendant Milliken’s mischaracterizations of his actions towards Bruening. A true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit \n18. \n231. Dr. Meriwether explained to Defendant Bauer that “this whole controversy \narose because I was treating [Bruening] precisely the same as I treat all other \nstudents. Regardless of his gender identity, Bruening is biologically male, and I \nreferred to him the same way as I refer to all other biologically male students.” Ex. \n18 at 1. \n232. Dr. Meriwether went on to note that he only started to refer to Bruening \ndifferently in an effort to accommodate Bruening’s request, that he never treated \nBruening differently in any other way, and that Bruening’s “access to educational \nbenefits and opportunities was never jeopardized.” Ex. 18 at 1.  \n233. On June 14, 2018, Defendant Bauer agreed with Defendant Milliken that Dr. \nMeriwether had violated Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. A true, accurate, \nand complete copy of his decision is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 19. \n29 \n\n \n234. In  agreeing  with  Defendant  Milliken,  Defendant  Bauer  approved  her \nrecommended disciplinary action and asked her to “provide [him] with a letter of \nwarning that will be placed in [Dr. Meriwether’s] personnel file.” Ex. 19 at 2. \n3.  Defendants Sanction Dr. Meriwether & Impose a Speech Code \n235. On June 22, 2018, Defendant Milliken issued the written warning to Dr. \nMeriwether. A true, accurate, and complete copy of her warning is attached to this \nComplaint as Exhibit 20.  \n236. Defendant Milliken’s warning reiterated that Dr. Meriwether had violated \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 20 at 1.  \n237. Defendant Milliken warned Dr. Meriwether to change the way he addresses \ntransgender individuals “to avoid further corrective actions.” Ex. 20 at 1.  \n238. On June 25, 2018, Defendant Bauer formally notified Dr. Meriwether of \nDefendant Milliken’s warning via e-mail. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this \ne-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 21.  \n4.  Defendants Affirm Their Disciplinary Actions & Speech Code \n239. On July 2, 2018, Dr. Meriwether submitted a grievance request to the Union, \noutlining provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that Defendants violated \nin disciplining him for his expression. A true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. \nMeriwether’s grievance request is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 22. \n240. On  August  16,  2018,  the  Union  submitted  a  formal  grievance  on  Dr. \nMeriwether’s behalf. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this formal grievance is \nattached to this Complaint as Exhibit 23.  \n241. In  this  grievance,  Dr.  Meriwether  asked  the  University  to  vacate  the \ndisciplinary  action  taken  against  him  and  to  allow  him  to  continue  speaking \nconsistent with his religious beliefs. Ex. 23 at 4.  \n242. On August 22, 2018, Dr. Poirot and Dr. Meriwether met with Defendant \nBauer to discuss the grievance.  \n30 \n\n \n243. Defendant Bauer, as provost, was the first official who would review Dr. \nMeriwether’s grievance.  \n244. At the meeting, Dr. Poirot attempted to explain how Defendants’ disciplinary \naction  against  Dr.  Meriwether  imperiled  his  ability  to  live  consistent  with  his \nsincerely held religious convictions, his academic freedom, and his free speech rights. \nA true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. Poirot’s account of this meeting is attached \nto this Complaint as Exhibit 24. \n245. Defendant Bauer repeatedly interrupted Dr. Poirot, clearly indicating that \nhe had no interest hearing Dr. Meriwether’s grievance. \n246. When Dr. Poirot outlined the religious beliefs that Dr. Meriwether and his \nchurch hold and how Defendants’ disciplinary actions would force Dr. Meriwether to \nviolate those teachings, Defendant Bauer openly laughed. \n247. By  laughing,  Defendant  Bauer  displayed  open  hostility  towards  Dr. \nMeriwether and his religious beliefs. \n248. During the meeting, Dr. Poirot again inquired as to whether Dr. Meriwether \nwould be complying with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies if he (1) referred to \nall students by their self-asserted gender identity and (2) placed a disclaimer in his \nsyllabus, noting that he was doing so under compulsion and setting forth his personal \nand religious beliefs about gender identity.  \n249. Defendant Bauer dismissed this approach, indicating that even this would \nviolate Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n250. Defendant Bauer’s conduct throughout the meeting was so uncooperative \nthat Dr. Poirot “was not able to present the grievance.” Ex. 24 at 2.  \n251. On September 5, 2018, Defendant Bauer e-mailed Dr. Meriwether stating, “I \nam denying your grievance.” A true, accurate, and complete copy of this e-mail, \nincluding  the  attached  decision  and  rationale,  is  attached  to  this  Complaint  as \nExhibit 25. \n31 \n\n \n252. On September 6, 2018, Dr. Meriwether appealed Defendant Bauer’s decision \nto the University’s president.  \n253. Shortly thereafter, the University’s president resigned and Defendant Bauer \nwas appointed interim president.  \n254. As a result, Defendant Bauer would be reviewing as interim president his \nown decision made as provost.  \n255. On September 14, 2018, Dr. Poirot and Dr. Meriwether met with Mr. David \nZender and Mr. Michael McPhillips, Defendant Bauer’s representatives, to discuss \nthe grievance. A true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. Poirot’s notes from this \nmeeting are attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 26. \n256. On October 4, 2018, Defendant Bauer issued his decision on Dr. Meriwether’s \ngrievance in his role as interim president. A true, accurate, and complete copy of his \ndecision as interim president is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 27. \n257. Defendant  Bauer  denied  Dr.  Meriwether’s  grievance  and  adopted  Mr. \nZender’s recommended decision. Ex. 27 at 11. \n258. Defendant Bauer erroneously claimed that “this is not a hostile environment \nclaim.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n259. In  saying  this,  Defendant  Bauer  contradicted  Defendant  Johnson’s \ninvestigation report, Ex. 13 at 1, 4; Defendant Milliken’s charge notice, Ex. 14 at 1; \nand Defendant Milliken’s report outlining her findings after the investigation, Ex. 17 \nat 2.  \n260. Defendant Bauer erroneously claimed that Dr. Meriwether “refused to stop \nsingling out [Bruening] because of her gender identity.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n261. In reality, Dr. Meriwether offered to accommodate Bruening by referring to \nhim by whatever name Bruening preferred.  \n262. Dr. Meriwether never singled out Bruening for any reason, including his self-\nasserted gender identity. \n32 \n\n \n263. Defendant  Bauer  concluded  that  Dr.  Meriwether  discriminated  against \nBruening based on gender identity. Ex. 27 at 13. \n264. However, Defendant Bauer never explained how Dr. Meriwether’s expression \n“denie[d] or limit[ed] [Bruening’s] ability to obtain the benefits of Shawnee State’s \nprograms or activities.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n265. Defendant  Bauer  concluded  again  that  Dr.  Meriwether  had  violated \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 27 at 13.  \n266. Defendant  Bauer  concluded  that  he  could  not  grant  Dr.  Meriwether’s \nrequested religious accommodation because “it is conceivable that SSU employs or \nmay in the future employ faculty members with sincerely held religious beliefs that, \ne.g., one national origin is superior to another national origin, or one sex is inferior to \nthe other sex.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n267. That  is,  Defendant  Bauer  dismissed  Dr.  Meriwether’s  request  for \naccommodation of his religious beliefs by equating them with those of hypothetical \nracists and sexists. Ex. 27 at 13. \n268. In  so  doing,  Defendant  Bauer  displayed  open  hostility  to  Defendant \nMeriwether’s religious beliefs.  \n269. Defendant Bauer also concluded that Dr. Meriwether would still violate \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies if he were to refer to students by their self-\nasserted gender identity and include a disclaimer in his syllabus setting forth his \npersonal and religious beliefs on the subject. Ex. 27 at 13.  \n270. With respect to names, Defendant Milliken had given Dr. Meriwether only \ntwo choices if he wanted to comply with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, and \nDefendant Bauer now gave him the same two choices:  (1) stop referring to students \nby their last names and titles, thereby altering the pedagogical environment in his \nclassroom; or (2) use titles that refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, \nwhich would require him to violate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs. \n33 \n\n \n271. With respect to pronouns, Defendant Milliken had given Dr. Meriwether only \ntwo choices if he wanted to comply with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, and \nDefendant Bauer now gave him the same two choices: (1) stop using pronouns alto-\ngether, which is unreasonable and impossible, especially given the Socratic teaching \nstyle that he uses; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s self-asserted gender \nidentity,  which  would  require  him  to  violate  his  conscience  and  sincerely  held \nreligious beliefs.  \nSTATEMENTS OF LAW \n272. At all times relevant to this Complaint, each and all of the acts and policies \nalleged herein were attributed to Defendants who acted under color of a statute, \nregulation, or custom of the State of Ohio (i.e., under color of state law and authority). \n273. Defendants  knew  or  should  have  known  that  they  were  violating  Dr. \nMeriwether’s constitutional and contractual rights by: \na.  Subjecting Dr. Meriwether to disciplinary action because he spoke in a \nway that communicated his beliefs regarding gender identity; \nb.  Placing  a  warning  letter  in  his  personnel  file  that  threatens  further \ndisciplinary action if he engages in “any such behaviors” in the future;  \nc.  Compelling Dr. Meriwether to speak in a way that affirms and recognizes \nas true the idea that a person can change his or her gender or identify \ndifferently than his or her birth sex;  \nd.  Prohibiting Dr. Meriwether from living and speaking in a way that is \nconsistent with his religious beliefs and punishing him when he tried to \ndo so;  \ne.  Refusing to grant Dr. Meriwether a religious accommodation;  \nf.  Disciplining Dr.  Meriwether  in  violation  of  the  Collective  Bargaining \nAgreement. \n274. The  policies  and  practices  that  led  to  the  violation  of  Dr.  Meriwether’s \n34 \n\n \nconstitutional and contractual rights remain in full force and effect. \n275. Dr.  Meriwether  is  suffering  irreparable  harm  from  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies and the way those policies have been enforced. \n276. Dr. Meriwether has no adequate or speedy remedy at law to correct the \ndeprivation of his rights by Defendants. \n277. Defendants’  actions  and  policies,  as  set  forth  above,  do  not  serve  any \nlegitimate or compelling state interest and are not narrowly tailored to serve any \nsuch interests. \n278. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are not nar-\nrowly tailored as applied to Dr. Meriwether because Dr. Meriwether’s expression does \nnot implicate any of the legitimate interests Defendants might have. \n279. Unless the policies and conduct of Defendants are enjoined, Dr. Meriwether \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n280. Under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, Dr. Meriwether is entitled to appropriate \nrelief invalidating Defendants’ challenged policies and related conduct. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nRetaliation \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n281. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n282. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity, Defendants have retaliated and are retaliating \nagainst Dr. Meriwether for exercising his First Amendment rights.  \n283. When Dr. Meriwether communicated his views regarding transgenderism \nthrough his choice of titles and pronouns in his interactions with students and in his \nclassroom, he was speaking on a matter of public concern, engaging in speech related \nto teaching and scholarship, and engaging in expression the First Amendment protects. \n35 \n\n \n284. Dr. Meriwether’s interest, as a professor at a public university, in discussing \nmatters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of  teaching  and  scholarship  outweighs \nDefendants’ interest in the efficient provision of services. \n285. Dr.  Meriwether’s  speech  on  matters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of \nteaching  and  scholarship  never  prevented  Defendants  from  efficiently  providing \nservices to the public (or even threatened to do so).  \n286. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, their enforcement of those policies, \nand their threatened future enforcement of those policies would deter a person of \nordinary firmness from exercising his right to free speech in the future. \n287. Defendants  have  enforced  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  against  Dr. \nMeriwether and threaten to do so in the future at least in part because of the views \nhe  has  expressed  on  matters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of  teaching  and \nscholarship, expression that the First Amendment protects.  \n288. Defendants subjected Dr. Meriwether to discipline and threaten to do so \nagain in the future due to the content and viewpoint of Dr. Meriwether’s speech. \n289. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nContent & Viewpoint Discrimination \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n290. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n291. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews  regarding  gender  identity,  Defendants  have  engaged  in  content  and/or \nviewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. \n292. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  require  officials  to  evaluate  the \n36 \n\n \ncontent and viewpoint of faculty expression to determine whether it constitutes \ndiscrimination or harassment and whether it creates a hostile environment.  \n293. Defendants  considered  the  content  and  viewpoint  of  Dr.  Meriwether’s \nexpression when they decided to enforce their Nondiscrimination Policies against him \nand they threaten to do so again if he continues to express his views.  \n294. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  confer  unbridled  discretion  upon \nUniversity officials to discriminate based on content or viewpoint.  \n295. Defendants  exercised  this  unbridled  discretion  when  they  punished  Dr. \nMeriwether for expressing his views regarding gender identity.  \n296. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies are unconstitutionally overbroad because they restrict a significant amount \nof constitutionally protected speech.  \n297. The overbreadth of Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies chills the speech \nof Dr. Meriwether, who seeks to engage in protected expression in his interactions \nwith students on campus and in the classroom.  \n298. Dr. Meriwether’s expression regarding gender identity is protected by the \nFirst Amendment.  \n299. By placing a written warning in his personnel file for allegedly violating their \nNondiscrimination Policies, Defendants have punished Dr. Meriwether for engaging \nin expression the First Amendment protects. \n300. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n301. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \n37 \n\n \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n302. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for refusing to \ncommunicate a University-mandated ideological message regarding gender identity, \nDefendants have attempted and are attempting to compel Dr. Meriwether’s speech, \nin violation of his rights under the First Amendment. \n303. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies compel Dr. Meriwether to communicate messages about gender identity that \nhe does not hold, that he does not wish to communicate, and that conflict with (and \nfor him to violate) his religious beliefs. \n304. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Free Exercise of Religion \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n305. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n306. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for exercising his \nsincerely held religious beliefs in the way he discusses issues regarding gender \nidentity, Defendants have violated and are violating his right to free exercise of \nreligion under the First Amendment. \n307. Dr.  Meriwether’s  views  and  expression  related  to  gender  identity  are \nmotivated by his sincerely held religious beliefs, are avenues through which he \nexercises his religious faith, and constitute a central component of his sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \n308. Expressing the University’s mandated message regarding gender identity \nwould require Dr. Meriwether to violate his sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n309. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are neither \n38 \n\n \nneutral nor generally applicable but allow Defendants to target religious expression \nand activities specifically and to express hostility to such expression.  \n310. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are neither \nneutral nor generally applicable because they represent a system of individualized \nassessments.  \n311. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunderinclusive, prohibiting some expression while leaving other expression equally \nharmful to the University’s asserted interests unprohibited. \n312. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices burden several \nof  Dr.  Meriwether’s  constitutional  rights,  including  his  rights  under  the  First \nAmendment  (e.g.,  freedom  of  speech,  freedom  from  retaliation,  free  exercise  of \nreligion), the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and the Fourteenth Amendment \n(e.g., due process and equal protection). \n313. Defendants violated Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion when \nthey  applied  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  to  discipline  Dr.  Meriwether  for \ncommunicating his views on issues related to gender identity and to compel him to \ncommunicate views on those same subjects that violate his religious beliefs, and they \ncontinue to do so by threatening to punish him if he continues to communicate his \nbeliefs or if he continues to refuse to communicate views on those same subjects that \nviolate his religious beliefs.   \n314. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed by \nthe First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiffs’ Right to be Free from Unconstitutional Conditions \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n315. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n39 \n\n \n316. By conditioning Dr. Meriwether’s status as a professor in good standing at \nthe University (and ultimately his employment at the University) on his willingness \nto  surrender  various  constitutional  rights,  Defendants  have  imposed  and  are \nimposing an unconstitutional condition on him in violation of his First Amendment \nrights. \n317. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies impose an unconstitutional condition upon faculty members’ right to free \nspeech and their receipt of state benefits (e.g., avoiding disciplinary actions up to and \nincluding termination, remaining a professor at a public university).  \n318. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies require faculty members to surrender their constitutionally protected rights \nto freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, due process, and equal protection to \navoid disciplinary actions up to and including termination.  \n319. Defendants  enforced  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  against  Dr. \nMeriwether, making it clear that he can only avoid further disciplinary action if he \nsurrenders his constitutionally protected rights to freedom of speech, free exercise of \nreligion, due process, and equal protection.  \n320. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to be free from unconstitutional conditions.  \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment Right to  \nDue Process of Law \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n321. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n322. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether under vague and \noverbroad policies, Defendants have violated and are violating Dr. Meriwether’s right \nto due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n40 \n\n \n323. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are overbroad \nbecause they encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.  \n324. Dr. Meriwether’s expression regarding gender identity is protected by the \nFirst Amendment.  \n325. By placing a written warning in his personnel file for allegedly violating their \nNondiscrimination Policies, Defendants have punished Dr. Meriwether for engaging \nin expression the First Amendment protects.  \n326. Defendants’ written warning to Dr. Meriwether, issued under the authority \nof their Nondiscrimination Policies, threatens to punish him if he engages in a wide \nvariety  of  constitutionally  protected  expression  in the future  in violation of Dr. \nMeriwether’s right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n327. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunconstitutionally vague because they grant University officials unbridled discretion \nin deciding what constitutes “gender identity” and “gender identity discrimination,” \nbecause they utilize terms that are inherently subjective and elude any precise or \nobjective definition that would be consistent from one official, professor, or student to \nanother, because they are incapable of providing meaningful guidance to Defendants \nand other University officials, and because they force professors to guess whether \nexpression that the First Amendment protects is in fact allowed on campus. \n328. The  lack  of  objective  criteria,  factors,  or  standards  in  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies and related practices renders these policies and practices \nunconstitutionally vague and in violation of Dr. Meriwether’s right to due process of \nlaw under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment Right to  \nEqual Protection of the Law \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n329. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \n41 \n\n \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n330. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity when they would not punish professors who express \nopposite views on those same subjects, Defendants have violated and are violating \nDr.  Meriwether’s  right  to  equal  protection  of  the  law  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n331. Dr. Meriwether is similarly situated to other professors at the University. \n332. Defendants take no disciplinary action against professors who support and \nendorse the concepts of gender identity, but they take disciplinary action against \nprofessors, like Dr. Meriwether, who refuse to endorse those concepts.  \n333. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  have  also  been  applied  to \ndiscriminate intentionally against Dr. Meriwether’s rights to freedom of speech, right \nto be free from compelled speech, free exercise of religion, right to be free from \nunconstitutional conditions, and right to due process of law. Thus, discriminatory \nintent is presumed.  \n334. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices burden Dr. \nMeriwether’s fundamental rights, target a suspect class (i.e., religion), and have no \nrational basis.  \n335. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunderinclusive, prohibiting some expression while leaving other expression equally \nharmful to the University’s asserted interests unprohibited. \n336. Defendants applied their Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices to \nDr. Meriwether in a discriminatory and unequal manner, granting other professors \nthe right to express their views on issues related to gender identity while denying \nthat right to Dr. Meriwether, in violation of Dr. Meriwether’s right to equal protection \nof the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n   \n42 \n\n \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Rights of Conscience and Free Exercise of Religion \n(Ohio Const. Art. I § 7) \n337. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n338. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for exercising his \nsincerely held religious beliefs according to the dictates of his own conscience in the \nway he discusses issues regarding gender identity, Defendants have violated and are \nviolating his right to free exercise of religion under the Article I § 7 of the Ohio \nConstitution. \n339. The  religious  convictions  Dr.  Meriwether  expressed  and  with  which  he \nsought to live in accordance are sincerely held religious beliefs. \n340. Defendants have infringed on Dr. Meriwether’s right to engage freely in his \nreligious practices by enforcing their Nondiscrimination Policies to force him to \nexpress views on gender identity that conflict with his religious beliefs and that force \nhim to violate his conscience and religious convictions by expressing their preferred \nviews on gender identity.  \n341. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices do not serve \nany government interests of sufficient magnitude to override Dr. Meriwether’s right \nto live out the dictates of his faith according to his own conscience.  \n342. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed by \nArticle I § 7 of the Ohio Constitution. \nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nBreach of Contract \n343. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–280 of this Complaint. \n344. Under Ohio law, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Shawnee \nEducation Association and the University represents an enforceable contract between \n43 \n\n \nthe University and Dr. Meriwether. \n345. Throughout his career at the University, Dr. Meriwether had substantially \nperformed  his  duties  under  the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  and  had  not \nmaterially breached that Agreement.  \n346. By subjecting Dr. Meriwether to a formal investigation even though none of \nthe contractual conditions were met and then subjecting him to disciplinary actions \nunder  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies,  Defendants  breached  the  Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \n347. By  subjecting  Dr.  Meriwether  to  disciplinary  action  under  their \nNondiscrimination Policies for expression that is protected by academic freedom (as \ncontractually defined) and the First Amendment, Defendants breached the Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \n348. Defendants  have  no  legal  excuse  for  these  breaches  of  the  Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  enter  judgment \nagainst Defendants and provide Plaintiff with the following relief: \nA. A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and \nrelated  practices  violate  Dr.  Meriwether’s  rights  under  the  First  and/or \nFourteenth Amendments; \nB. A preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants sued in their \nofficial capacities, their agents, officials, servants, employees, and any other \npersons acting on their behalf from enforcing Defendants’ Nondiscrimination \nPolicies to prohibit Dr. Meriwether from expressing his views regarding gender \nidentity or to punish him for expressing those views, including addressing and \nreferring to students based on their biological sex;  \nC. A preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Defendants sued in their \n44 \n\n \nofficial capacities, their agents, officials, servants, employees, and any other \npersons acting on their behalf to purge Dr. Meriwether’s personnel file of any \nreference to the punishment they imposed on him for expressing his views \nregarding gender identity, including the June 22, 2018 written warning;  \nD. Nominal  damages  for  the  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment rights; \nE. Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other costs and disbursements \nin this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \nF.  All other further relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled. \nRespectfully submitted this 5th day of November, 2018. \n/s/ Travis C. Barham   \nDAVID A. CORTMAN*  THOMAS W.

Traditionally, American universities have been beacons of \nintellectual diversity and academic freedom.  They have prided themselves on being forums \nwhere controversial ideas are discussed and debated.  And they have tried not to stifle debate by \npicking sides.  But Shawnee State chose a different route:  It punished a professor for his speech \non a hotly contested issue.  And it did so despite the constitutional protections afforded by the \nFirst Amendment.  The district court dismissed the professor’s free-speech and free-exercise \nclaims.  We see things differently and reverse.   \nI. \nThe district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss, so we construe the complaint \nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  That means we must accept the complaint’s factual \nallegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Meriwether’s favor.  Handy-Clay v. City \nof Memphis, 695 F.3d 531, 538 (6th Cir. 2012).  Under this standard, we must reverse the district \ncourt’s dismissal unless “it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in \nsupport of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Id. (quoting Guzman v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., 679 F.3d 425, 429 (6th Cir. 2012)).   \n\n(6 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 3 \nA. \nNicholas Meriwether is a philosophy professor at Shawnee State University, a small \npublic college in Portsmouth, Ohio.  Shawnee State began awarding bachelor’s degrees just \nthirty years ago.  And for twenty-five of those years, Professor Meriwether has been a fixture at \nthe school.  He has served in the faculty senate, designed a bachelor’s degree program in \nPhilosophy and Religion, led study-abroad trips, and taught countless students in classes ranging \nfrom Ethics to the History of Christian Thought.  Up until the incident that triggered this lawsuit, \nMeriwether had a spotless disciplinary record. \nProfessor Meriwether is also a devout Christian.  He strives to live out his faith each day.  \nAnd, like many people of faith, his religious convictions influence how he thinks about “human \nnature, marriage, gender, sexuality, morality, politics, and social issues.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1469.  \nMeriwether believes that “God created human beings as either male or female, that this sex is \nfixed in each person from the moment of conception, and that it cannot be changed, regardless of \nan individual’s feelings or desires.”  Id.  He also believes that he cannot “affirm as true ideas and \nconcepts that are not true.”  Id.  Being faithful to his religion was never a problem at Shawnee \nState.  But in 2016, things changed. \nAt the start of the school year, Shawnee State emailed the faculty informing them that \nthey had to refer to students by their “preferred pronoun[s].”  Id. at 1471–72.  Meriwether asked \nuniversity officials for more details about the new pronoun policy, and the officials confirmed \nthat professors would be disciplined if they “refused to use a pronoun that reflects a student’s \nself-asserted  gender  identity.”    Id.  at  1472.    What  if  a  professor  had  moral  or  religious \nobjections?  That didn’t matter:  The policy applied “regardless of the professor’s convictions or \nviews on the subject.”  Id. \nWhen Meriwether asked to see the revised policy, university officials pointed him to the \nschool’s existing policy prohibiting discrimination “because of . . . gender identity.”  R. 34-1, Pg. \nID 1509.  That policy applies to all of the university’s “employees, students, visitors, agents and \nvolunteers”; it applies at both academic and non-academic events; it applies on all university \n\n(7 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 4 \nproperty (including classrooms, dorms, and athletic fields); and it sometimes applies off campus.  \nR.34-2, Pg. ID 1511–12.\nMeriwether  approached  the  chair  of  his  department,  Jennifer  Pauley,  to  discuss  his \nconcerns about the newly announced rules.  Pauley was derisive and scornful.  Knowing that \nMeriwether had successfully taught courses on Christian thought for decades, she said that \nChristians are “primarily motivated out of fear” and should be “banned from teaching courses \nregarding that religion.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1473.  In her view, even the “presence of religion in \nhigher education is counterproductive.”  Id. \nMeriwether continued to teach students without incident until January 2018.  On the first \nday of class, Meriwether was using the Socratic method to lead discussion in his course on \nPolitical Philosophy.  When using that method, he addresses students as “Mr.” or “Ms.”  He \nbelieves “this formal manner of addressing students helps them view the academic enterprise as a \nserious, weighty endeavor” and “foster[s] an atmosphere of seriousness and mutual respect.”  Id. \nat 1475.  He “has found that addressing students in this fashion is an important pedagogical tool \nin all of his classes, but especially in Political Philosophy where he and [the] students discuss \nmany of the most controversial issues of public concern.”  Id.  In that first class, one of the \nstudents Meriwether called on was Doe.  According to Meriwether, “no one . . . would have \nassumed that [Doe] was female” based on Doe’s outward appearances.  Id. at 1474.  Thus, \nMeriwether responded to a question from Doe by saying, “Yes, sir.”  Id.  This was Meriwether’s \nfirst time meeting Doe, and the university had not provided Meriwether with any information \nabout Doe’s sex or gender identity. \nAfter  class,  Doe  approached Meriwether  and “demanded” that Meriwether “refer to \n[Doe] as a woman” and use “feminine titles and pronouns.”  Id. at1475.  This was the first time \nthat  Meriwether  learned  that  Doe  identified  as  a  woman.    So  Meriwether  paused  before \nresponding  because  his  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  prevented  him  from  communicating \nmessages about gender identity that he believes are false.  He explained that he wasn’t sure if he \ncould comply with Doe’s demands.  Doe became hostile—circling around Meriwether at first, \nand then approaching him in a threatening manner:  “I guess this means I can call you a cu--.”  \nId.  Doe promised that Meriwether would be fired if he did not give in to Doe’s demands. \n\n(8 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 5 \nMeriwether reported the incident to senior university officials, including the Dean of \nStudents and his department chair, Jennifer Pauley.  University officials then informed their Title \nIX office of the incident.  Officials from that office met with Doe and escalated Doe’s complaint \nto Roberta Milliken, the Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. \nDean  Milliken  went  to  Meriwether’s  office  the  next  day.    She  “advised”  that  he \n“eliminate all sex-based references from his expression”—no using “he” or “she,” “him” or \n“her,” “Mr.” or “Ms.,” and so on.  Id. at 1476–77.  Meriwether pointed out that eliminating \npronouns  altogether  was  next  to  impossible,  especially  when  teaching.    So  he  proposed  a \ncompromise:  He would keep using pronouns to address most students in class but would refer to \nDoe using only Doe’s last name.  Dean Milliken accepted this compromise, apparently believing \nit followed the university’s gender-identity policy. \nDoe  continued  to  attend  and  participate  in  Meriwether’s  class.    But  Doe  remained \ndissatisfied and, two weeks into the semester, complained to university officials again.  So Dean \nMilliken paid Meriwether another visit.  This time, she said that if Meriwether did not address \nDoe as a woman, he would be violating the university’s policy. \nSoon  after,  Meriwether  accidentally  referred  to  Doe  using  the  title  “Mr.”  before \nimmediately correcting himself.  Around this time, Doe again complained to the university’s \nTitle IX Coordinator and threatened to retain counsel if the university didn’t take action.  So \nDean Milliken once again came to Meriwether’s office.  She reiterated her earlier demand and \nthreatened disciplinary action if he did not comply.  \nTrying to find common ground, Meriwether asked whether the university’s policy would \nallow him to use students’ preferred pronouns but place a disclaimer in his syllabus “noting that \nhe was doing so under compulsion and setting forth his personal and religious beliefs about \ngender identity.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1478.  Dean Milliken rejected this option out of hand.  She \ninsisted that putting a disclaimer in the syllabus would itself violate the university’s gender-\nidentity policy. \nDuring the rest of the semester, Meriwether called on Doe using Doe’s last name, and \n“Doe displayed no anxiety, fear, or intimidation” while attending class.  Id. at 1477–79.  In fact, \n\n(9 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 6 \nDoe excelled and participated as much or more than any other student in the course.  At the end \nof the semester, Meriwether awarded Doe a “high grade.”  Id. at 1479.  This grade reflected \nDoe’s “very good work” and “frequent participation in class discussions.”  Id. \nB. \nAs the semester proceeded, Meriwether continued to search for an accommodation of his \npersonal and religious views that would satisfy the university.  But Shawnee State was not \nwilling to compromise.  After Dean Milliken’s final meeting with Meriwether, she sent him a \nformal letter reiterating her demand:  Address Doe in the same manner “as other students who \nidentify themselves as female.”  R. 34-9, Pg. ID 1702.  The letter said that if Meriwether did not \ncomply, “the University may conduct an investigation” and that he could be subject to “informal \nor formal disciplinary action.”  Id.  \nThen, just a few days later—and without waiting for a response from Meriwether—\nMilliken announced that she was “initiating a formal investigation.”  R. 34-10, Pg. ID 1703.  She \nclaimed that she was doing so because she received “another complaint from a student in \n[Meriwether’s] class.”  Id.  The complaint was again from Doe.  When Meriwether again asked \nwhether an accommodation might be possible given his sincerely held beliefs, Milliken shot him \ndown.  She said he had just two options:  (1) stop using all sex-based pronouns in referring to \nstudents (a practical impossibility that would also alter the pedagogical environment in his \nclassroom), or (2) refer to Doe as a female, even though doing so would violate Meriwether’s \nreligious beliefs. \nDean Milliken referred the matter to Shawnee State’s Title IX office.  Over the coming \nmonths,  the  university’s  Title  IX  staff  conducted  a  less-than-thorough  investigation.    They \ninterviewed just four witnesses—Meriwether, Doe, and two other transgender students.  They \ndid  not  ask  Meriwether  to  recommend  any  potential  witnesses.    And  aside  from  Doe  and \nMeriwether themselves, none of the witnesses testified about a single interaction between the \ntwo. \nShawnee State’s Title IX office concluded that “Meriwether’s disparate treatment [of \nDoe] ha[d] created a hostile environment” in violation of the university’s nondiscrimination \n\n(10 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 7 \npolicies.  R. 34-13, Pg. ID 1719.  Those policies prohibit “discrimination against any individual \nbecause of . . . gender identity.”  R. 34-1, Pg. ID 1509.  They define gender identity as a \n“person’s innermost concept of self as male or female or both or neither.”  R. 34-2, Pg. ID 1522.  \nAnd they define a hostile educational environment as “any situation in which there is harassing \nconduct that limits, interferes with or denies educational benefits or opportunities, from both a \nsubjective (the complainant’s) and an objective (reasonable person’s) viewpoint.”  Id. at 1522–\n23. The Title IX report concluded that because Doe “perceives them self as a female,” and\nbecause  Meriwether  has  “refuse[d]  to  recognize”  that  identity  by  using  female  pronouns, \nMeriwether engaged in discrimination and “created a hostile environment.”  R. 34-13, Pg. ID \n1719.  The report did not mention Meriwether’s request for an accommodation based on his \nsincerely held religious beliefs. \nAfter  the  Title  IX  report  issued,  Dean  Milliken  informed  Meriwether  that  she  was \nbringing a “formal charge” against him under the faculty’s collective bargaining agreement.  \nR.34-14, Pg. ID 1731.  She then issued her own report setting forth her findings:  “Because\nDr. Meriwether repeatedly refused to change the way he addressed [Doe] in his class due to his \nviews on transgender people, and because the way he treated [Doe] was deliberately different \nthan the way he treated others in the class, . . . he effectively created a hostile environment for \n[Doe].”  R. 34-17, Pg. ID 1742.  Milliken’s whole explanation of how Meriwether violated \nuniversity policy spanned just one paragraph.  Id. (final paragraph).  Finally, to create a “safe \neducational  experience  for all students,” Dean Milliken concluded that it was necessary to \ndiscipline Meriwether.  Id.  She recommended placing a formal warning in his file.  \nProvost Jeffrey Bauer was tasked with reviewing Milliken’s disciplinary recommendation \nbefore it was imposed.  Meriwether wrote Provost Bauer a letter stating that he treated Doe \nexactly the same as he treated all male students; that he began referring to Doe without pronouns \nand by Doe’s last name as an accommodation to Doe; and that Doe’s “access to educational \nbenefits and opportunities was never jeopardized.”  R. 34-18, Pg. ID 1766.  Meriwether further \nexplained that he could not use female pronouns to refer to Doe due to his “conscience and \nreligious convictions.”  Id.  He asked Provost Bauer to allow “reasonable minds . . . to differ” on \nthis “newly emerging cultural issue.”  Id.  Provost Bauer rejected Meriwether’s request, stating \n\n(11 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 8 \nthat he “approve[d] Dean Milliken’s recommendation of formal disciplinary action.”  R. 34-19, \nPg. ID 1770.  Bauer did not address Meriwether’s arguments to the contrary, nor did he grapple \nwith Meriwether’s request for a religious accommodation.  \nShawnee  State  then  placed  a  written  warning  in  Meriwether’s  file.    The  warning \nreprimanded Meriwether and directed him to change the way he addresses transgender students \nto “avoid further corrective actions.”  R. 34-20, Pg. ID 1771.  What does “further corrective \nactions” mean?  Suspension without pay and termination, among other possible punishments.  \nR.34-4, Pg. ID 1646; see also R. 34, Pg. ID 1487.\nC. \nThe Shawnee State faculty union then filed a grievance on Meriwether’s behalf.  It asked \nthe university to (1) vacate the disciplinary action, and (2) allow Meriwether to keep speaking in \na manner consistent with his religious beliefs. \nProvost Bauer, who had already rejected Meriwether’s claim once, was tasked with \ndeciding the grievance.  A union representative, Dr. Chip Poirot, joined Meriwether to present \nthe grievance at a hearing.  From the outset, Bauer exhibited deep hostility.  He repeatedly \ninterrupted the representative and made clear that he would not discuss the academic freedom \nand religious discrimination aspects of the case.  The union representative tried to explain the \nteachings of Meriwether’s church and why Meriwether felt he was being compelled to affirm a \nposition at odds with his faith.  At one point during the hearing, Provost Bauer “openly laughed.”  \nR. 34-24, Pg. ID 1780.  Indeed, Bauer was so hostile that the union representative “was not able\nto present the grievance.”  Id. at 1780–81.  Bauer denied the grievance. \nThe next step in Shawnee State’s grievance process involved an appeal to the university’s \npresident.  In a twist of fate, the president turned out to be Bauer.  Shortly after Provost Bauer \ndenied the grievance, he was appointed interim university president.  Bauer designated two of his \nrepresentatives, Shawnee State’s Labor Relations Director and General Counsel, to meet with \nMeriwether and Poirot on his behalf. \n\n(12 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 9 \nThe officials agreed with the union that Meriwether’s conduct had not “created a hostile \neducational  environment.”  R. 34-27, Pg. ID 1799.  But  they recommended ruling against \nMeriwether anyway.  This was, they said, not a hostile-environment case; instead, it was a \n“differential treatment” case.  Id.  This change in theory contradicted the Title IX investigation \nand Dean Milliken’s disciplinary recommendation (which Provost Bauer approved)—both of \nwhich accused Meriwether of violating university policy by “creat[ing] a hostile environment for \n[Doe].”    R. 34-13,  Pg.  ID  1719;  R. 34-17,  Pg.  ID  1741–42.    The  officials  justified  the \nuniversity’s refusal to accommodate Meriwether’s religious beliefs by equating his views to \nthose of a hypothetical racist or sexist.  R. 34, Pg. ID 1490; R. 34-27, Pg. ID 1799.  Since the \nuniversity  would  not  accommodate  religiously  motivated  racism  or  sexism,  it  ought  not \naccommodate Meriwether’s religious beliefs.  Bauer adopted his representatives’ findings and \ndenied the grievance again. \nThat was the end of the grievance process at Shawnee State.  Because Meriwether now \nfears that he will be fired or suspended without pay if he does not toe the university’s line on \ngender identity, he alleges he cannot address “a high profile issue of public concern that has \nsignificant philosophical implications.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1492–93.  He steers class discussions \naway from gender-identity issues and has refused to address the subject when students have \nraised it in class.  The warning letter in Meriwether’s file will also make it “difficult, if not \nimpossible,” for him to obtain a position at another institution once he retires from Shawnee \nState.  Id. at 1493. \nD. \nOut of options at Shawnee State, Meriwether filed this lawsuit.  He alleged that the \nuniversity violated his rights under:  (1) the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First \nAmendment; (2) the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; \n(3)the Ohio Constitution; and (4) his contract with the university.\nThe district court referred the case to a magistrate judge.  Doe and an organization, \nSexuality and Gender Acceptance, then moved to intervene, and the magistrate granted their \nmotion.  Next, the defendants and intervenors filed separate motions to dismiss under Rule \n\n(13 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 10 \n12(b)(6).    The  magistrate  recommended  dismissing  all  of  Meriwether’s  federal  claims  and \ndeclining  to exercise supplemental  jurisdiction  over his  state-law  claims.   Meriwether then \nobjected to the magistrate’s report and recommendation.  But the district court adopted it in full. \nMeriwether now appeals the district court’s decision, except for its dismissal of his equal-\nprotection claim.  We first address Meriwether’s free-speech claim before turning to his free-\nexercise and due-process claims. \nII. \n“Universities  have  historically  been  fierce  guardians  of  intellectual  debate  and  free \nspeech.”    Speech  First,  Inc.  v.  Schlissel,  939  F.3d  756,  761  (6th  Cir.  2019).    But  here, \nMeriwether alleges that Shawnee State’s application of its gender-identity policy violated the \nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  The district court rejected this argument and held \nthat a professor’s speech in the classroom is never protected by the First Amendment.  We \ndisagree:  Under controlling Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precedent, the First Amendment \nprotects the academic speech of university professors.  Since Meriwether has plausibly alleged \nthat Shawnee State violated his First Amendment rights by compelling his speech or silence and \ncasting a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom, his free-speech claim may proceed. \nA. \n1. \nStart with the basics.  The First Amendment protects “the right to speak freely and the \nright to refrain from speaking at all.”  Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977).  Thus, the \ngovernment “may not compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees.”  Hurley \nv. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos., 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995).  When the\ngovernment tries to do so anyway, it violates this “cardinal constitutional command.”  Janus v. \nAm. Fed’n of State, Cnty. & Mun. Emps., Council 31, 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2463 (2018). \nIt  should  come  as  little  surprise,  then,  “that  prominent  members  of  the  founding \ngeneration condemned laws requiring public employees to affirm or support beliefs with which \nthey  disagreed.”    Id.  at  2471  &  n.8  (citing  examples  including  Thomas  Jefferson,  Oliver \n\n(14 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 11 \nEllsworth, and Noah Webster).  Why?  Because free speech is “essential to our democratic form \nof government.”  Id. at 2464.  Without genuine freedom of speech, the search for truth is \nstymied, and the ideas and debates necessary for the continuous improvement of our republic \ncannot flourish.  See id. \nCourts have often recognized that the Free Speech Clause applies at public universities.  \nSee, e.g., Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 732–33 (6th Cir. 2012).  Thus, the state may not act as \nthough professors or students “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression \nat the [university] gate.”  Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 \n(1969).  Government officials violate the First Amendment whenever they try to “prescribe what \nshall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion,” and when they \n“force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”  W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. \nBarnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). \nTo  be  sure,  free-speech  rules  apply  differently  when  the  government  is  doing  the \nspeaking.  And that remains true even when a government employee is doing the talking.  Thus, \nin Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court held that normally “when public employees make \nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First \nAmendment  purposes,  and  the  Constitution  does  not  insulate  their  communications  from \nemployer discipline.”  547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006).   \n2. \nHere, the threshold question is whether the rule announced in Garcetti bars Meriwether’s \nfree-speech claim.  It does not.   \nGarcetti  set  forth  a  general  rule  regarding  government  employees’  speech.    But  it \nexpressly  declined  to  address  whether  its  analysis  would  apply  “to  a  case  involving \nspeech related to scholarship or teaching.”  547 U.S. at 425; see also Adams v. Trs. of the Univ. \nof N.C.-Wilmington, 640 F.3d 550, 563 (4th Cir. 2011) (“The plain language of Garcetti thus \nexplicitly left open the question of whether its principles apply in the academic genre where \nissues of ‘scholarship or teaching’ are in play.”).  Although Garcetti declined to address the \nquestion, we can turn to the Supreme Court’s prior decisions for guidance.  Those decisions have \n\n(15 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 12 \n“long  recognized  that,  given  the  important  purpose  of  public  education  and  the  expansive \nfreedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy \na special niche in our constitutional tradition.”  Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 329 (2003). \nStart with Sweezy v. New Hampshire.  354 U.S. 234 (1957) (plurality opinion).  During \nthe  McCarthy  era,  New  Hampshire  instituted  a  loyalty  program  “to  eliminate  ‘subversive \npersons’  among  government  personnel.”    Id.  at  236.    The  state  legislature  authorized  the \nAttorney General to become a “one-man legislative committee” and take appropriate action if he \nfound that a person was “subversive.”  Id. at 236–37.  When the Attorney General questioned \npublic university professor Paul Sweezy, he declined to reveal the contents of a lecture he had \ndelivered to “100 students in [a] humanities course.”  Id. at 243.  The Attorney General then had \nthe court hold him in contempt.  Id. at 244–45.  The case ultimately made its way to the Supreme \nCourt,  which  held  that  a  legislative  inquiry  into  the  contents  of  a  professor’s  lectures \n“unquestionably was an invasion of [his] liberties in the areas of academic freedom and political \nexpression.”  Id. at 250.  The Court explained that it “could not be seriously debated” that a \nprofessor’s “right to lecture” is protected by the Constitution.  Id. at 249–50.  And it emphasized \n“[t]he essentiality of freedom in the community of American universities.”  Id. at 250.  When the \nstate targets professors’ academic freedom rather than protects it, scholarship, teaching, and \neducation “cannot  flourish.”   Id.; see also  id. at  262 (Frankfurter, J., concurring  in  result) \n(“Political power must abstain from intrusion into this activity of freedom . . . except for reasons \nthat are exigent and obviously compelling.”).   \nA  decade  later,  in  a  case  involving  a  similar  New  York  law  banning  “subversive” \nactivities, the Supreme Court affirmed that the Constitution protects “academic freedom, which \nis of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned.”  Keyishian v. Bd. \nof Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967).  It characterized academic freedom as “a special concern \nof the First Amendment” and said that the First Amendment “does not tolerate laws that cast a \npall  of  orthodoxy  over  the  classroom.”    Id.    After  all,  the  classroom  is  “peculiarly  the \n‘marketplace of ideas.’”  Id.  And when the state stifles a professor’s viewpoint on a matter of \npublic import, much more than the professor’s rights are at stake.  Our nation’s future “depends \nupon leaders trained through wide exposure to [the] robust exchange of ideas”—not through the \n\n(16 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 13 \n“authoritative” compulsion of orthodox speech.  Id. (citation omitted); accord Sweezy, 354 U.S. \nat 249–50 (plurality opinion) (“To impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our \ncolleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.”). \nTogether,  Sweezy  and  Keyishian  establish  that  the  First  Amendment  protects  the \nfree-speech rights of professors when they are teaching.  See also Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, \n180–81  (1972)  (“[W]e  break  no  new  constitutional  ground  in  reaffirming  this  Nation’s \ndedication to safeguarding academic freedom.”); Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506 (“First Amendment \nrights . . . are available to teachers[.]”).   \nAs a result, our court has rejected as “totally unpersuasive” “the argument that teachers \nhave no First Amendment rights when teaching, or that the government can censor teacher \nspeech without restriction.”  Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll., 260 F.3d 671, 680 (6th Cir. 2001).  \nAnd  we  have  recognized  that  “a  professor’s  rights  to  academic  freedom  and  freedom  of \nexpression are paramount in the academic setting.”  Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 823 (6th \nCir. 2001); see Dambrot v. Cent. Mich. Univ., 55 F.3d 1177, 1188–89 (6th Cir. 1995).1  Simply \nput, professors at public universities retain First Amendment protections at least when engaged \nin core academic functions, such as teaching and scholarship.  See Hardy, 260 F.3d at 680.   \nIn reaffirming this conclusion, we join three of our sister circuits:  the Fourth, Fifth, and \nNinth.  In Adams v. Trustees of the University of North Carolina–Wilmington, the Fourth Circuit \nheld that Garcetti left open the question whether professors retained academic-freedom rights \nunder the First Amendment.  640 F.3d at 562.  It concluded that the rule announced in Garcetti \ndoes not apply “in the academic context of a public university.”  Id.; see also Lee v. York Cnty. \nSch. Div., 484 F.3d 687, 694 n.11 (4th Cir. 2007).  The Fifth Circuit has also held that the speech \nof public university professors is constitutionally protected, reasoning that “academic freedom is \na special concern of the First Amendment.”  Buchanan v. Alexander, 919 F.3d 847, 852–53 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation omitted) (analyzing the claim under the Pickering-Connick framework).  \n1Shawnee State and the intervenors suggest that our decision in Evans-Marshall v. Board of Education of\nTipp City is to the contrary.  624 F.3d 332 (6th Cir. 2010).  Not so.  There, we held that “the First Amendment does \nnot extend to the in-class curricular speech of teachers in primary and secondary schools.”  Id. at 334.  We \ndistinguished college and university professors and made clear that our holding was limited to schoolteachers.  Id. at \n343–44. \n\n(17 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 14 \nLikewise, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that “if applied to teaching and academic writing, \nGarcetti  would  directly  conflict  with  the  important  First  Amendment  values  previously \narticulated by the Supreme Court.”  Demers v. Austin, 746 F.3d 402, 411 (9th Cir. 2014).  Thus, \nit held that “Garcetti does not—indeed, consistent with the First Amendment, cannot—apply to \nteaching and academic writing that are performed ‘pursuant to the official duties’ of a teacher \nand professor.”  Id. at 412.   \nOne final point worth considering:  If professors lacked free-speech protections when \nteaching,  a  university  would  wield  alarming  power  to  compel  ideological  conformity.  \nA university president could require a pacifist to declare that war is just, a civil rights icon to \ncondemn the Freedom Riders, a believer to deny the existence of God, or a Soviet émigré to \naddress  his  students  as  “comrades.”    That  cannot  be.    “If  there  is  any  fixed  star  in  our \nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe” such orthodoxy.  \nBarnette, 319 U.S. at 642.  \n3. \nShawnee State and the intervenors raise several arguments in response. \nFirst, they suggest that we ought not apply the Supreme Court’s academic-freedom cases \nthat preceded Garcetti.  But our job as lower court judges is to apply existing Supreme Court \nprecedent unless it is expressly overruled.  Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).  And \nhere, the Supreme Court has not overruled its academic-freedom cases.  “It is not our prerogative \nto set this binding precedent aside.”  Mayhew v. Town of Smyrna, 856 F.3d 456, 464 (6th Cir. \n2017).  Nor is it our prerogative to cast aside our holding “that a teacher’s in-class speech \ndeserves constitutional protection.”  Hardy, 260 F.3d at 680.  Garcetti expressed no view on this \nissue and even recognized that “expression related to . . . classroom instruction” might not fit \nwithin the Court’s “customary employee-speech jurisprudence.”  Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 425.  \nThus, we remain bound by prior Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit precedent in this area. \nSecond, they argue that even if there is an academic-freedom exception to Garcetti, it \ndoes not protect Meriwether’s use of titles and pronouns in the classroom.  As they would have \nit, the use of pronouns has nothing to do with the academic-freedom interests in the substance of \n\n(18 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 15 \nclassroom instruction.  But that is not true.  Any teacher will tell you that choices about how to \nlead classroom discussion shape the content of the instruction enormously.  That is especially so \nhere because Meriwether’s choices touch on gender identity—a hotly contested matter of public \nconcern that “often” comes up during class discussion in Meriwether’s political philosophy \ncourses.  R. 34, Pg. ID 1492; see Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2476 (describing gender identity as a \n“controversial [and] sensitive political topic[] . . . of profound value and concern to the public” \n(cleaned up)).  \nBy forbidding Meriwether from describing his views on gender identity even in his \nsyllabus, Shawnee State silenced a viewpoint that could have catalyzed a robust and insightful \nin-class discussion.  Under the First Amendment, “the mere dissemination of ideas . . . on a state \nuniversity campus may not be shut off in the name alone of ‘conventions of decency.’”  Papish \nv. Bd. of Curators of the Univ. of Mo., 410 U.S. 667, 670 (1973) (per curiam).  Rather, the lesson\nof Pickering and the Court’s academic-freedom decisions is that the state may do so only when \nits interest in restricting a professor’s in-class speech outweighs his interest in speaking.   \nRemember, too, that the university’s position on titles and pronouns goes both ways.  By \ndefendants’ logic, a university could likewise prohibit professors from addressing university \nstudents by their preferred gender pronouns—no matter the professors’ own views.  And it could \neven impose such a restriction while denying professors the ability to explain to students why \nthey were doing so.  But that’s simply not the case.  Without sufficient justification, the state \ncannot  wield  its  authority  to  categorically  silence  dissenting  viewpoints.    See  Keyishian, \n385 U.S. at 602–03; Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 250–51 (plurality opinion); Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 U.S. 183, 195–96 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Barnette, 319 U.S. at 639; see also \nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 835–36 (1995). \nThus, the academic-freedom exception to Garcetti covers all classroom speech related to \nmatters of public concern, whether that speech is germane to the contents of the lecture or not.  \nThe need for the free exchange of ideas in the college classroom is unlike that in other public \nworkplace settings.  And a professor’s in-class speech to his students is anything but speech by \nan ordinary government employee.  Indeed, in the college classroom there are three critical \ninterests at stake (all supporting robust speech protection):  (1) the students’ interest in receiving \n\n(19 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 16 \ninformed opinion, (2) the professor’s right to disseminate his own opinion, and (3) the public’s \ninterest in exposing our future leaders to different viewpoints.  See Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, \n236 (2014); Sweezy, 354 U.S. at 250 (plurality opinion).  Because the First Amendment “must \nalways be applied ‘in light of the special characteristics of the . . . environment’ in the particular \ncase,” Healy, 408 U.S. at 180 (alteration in original) (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506), public \nuniversities  do  not  have  a  license  to  act  as  classroom  thought  police.    They  cannot  force \nprofessors  to  avoid  controversial  viewpoints  altogether  in  deference  to  a  state-mandated \northodoxy.  Otherwise, our public universities could transform the next generation of leaders into \n“closed-circuit  recipients  of  only  that  which  the  State  chooses  to  communicate.”    Tinker, \n393 U.S. at 511.  Thus, “what constitutes a matter of public concern and what raises academic \nfreedom concerns is of essentially the same character.”  Dambrot, 55 F.3d at 1188.   \nOf course, some classroom speech falls outside the exception:  A university might, for \nexample, require teachers to call roll at the start of class, and that type of non-ideological \nministerial task would not be protected by the First Amendment.  Shawnee State says that the \nrule at issue is similarly ministerial.  But as we discuss below, titles and pronouns carry a \nmessage.    The  university  recognizes  that  and  wants  its  professors  to  use  pronouns  to \ncommunicate a message:  People can have a gender identity inconsistent with their sex at birth.  \nBut Meriwether does not agree with that message, and he does not want to communicate it to his \nstudents.  That’s not a matter of classroom management; that’s a matter of academic speech. \nFinally,  defendants  argue  that  academic  freedom  belongs  to  public  universities,  not \nprofessors.  But we’ve held that university professors “have . . . First Amendment rights when \nteaching” that they may assert against the university.  Hardy, 260 F.3d at 680; see Bonnell, 241 \nF.3d at 823.  So this arguments fails.\nB. \nAlthough Garcetti does not bar Meriwether’s free-speech claim, that is not the end of the \nmatter.    We  must  now  apply  the  longstanding  Pickering-Connick  framework  to  determine \nwhether Meriwether has plausibly alleged that his in-class speech was protected by the First \nAmendment.  See Hardy, 260 F.3d at 678 (taking this approach in an academic-speech case); \n\n(20 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 17 \nAdams, 640 F.3d at 564 (same); Buchanan, 919 F.3d at 853 (same); Demers, 746 F.3d at 412–13 \n(same).  Under that framework, we ask two questions:  First, was Meriwether speaking on “a \nmatter of public concern”?  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 (1983).  And second, was his \ninterest in doing so greater than the university’s interest in “promoting the efficiency of the \npublic services it performs through” him?  Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).   \n1. \nTo  determine  whether  speech  involves  a  matter  of  public  concern,  we  look  to  the \n“content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.”  Connick, \n461 U.S. at 147–48.  When speech relates “to any matter of political, social, or other concern to \nthe community,” it addresses a matter of public concern.  Id. at 146.  Thus, a teacher’s in-class \nspeech about “race, gender, and power conflicts” addresses matters of public concern.  Hardy, \n260 F.3d at 679.  A basketball coach using racial epithets to motivate his players does not.  \nDambrot, 55 F.3d at 1190.  “The linchpin of the inquiry is, thus, for both public concern and \nacademic freedom,  the  extent to  which the speech advances  an idea  transcending  personal \ninterest or opinion which impacts our social and/or political lives.”  Id. at 1189.   \nMeriwether did just that in refusing to use gender-identity-based pronouns.  And the \n“point of his speech” (or his refusal to speak in a particular manner) was to convey a message.  \nId. at 1187.  Taken in context, his speech “concerns a struggle over the social control of language \nin a crucial debate about the nature and foundation, or indeed real existence, of the sexes.”  \nProfessors’ Amicus Br. at 1.  That is, his mode of address was the message.  It reflected his \nconviction that one’s sex cannot be changed, a topic which has been in the news on many \noccasions and “has become an issue of contentious political . . . debate.”  See Cockrel v. Shelby \nCnty. Sch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1036, 1051 (6th Cir. 2001).   \nFrom  courts  to  schoolrooms  this  controversy  continues.    Recently,  the  Fifth \nCircuit rejected an  appellant’s motion  to  be referred to  by the appellant’s preferred gender \npronouns—over an “emphatic[] dissent.”  United States v. Varner, 948 F.3d 250, 254, 261 (5th \nCir. 2020).  And, on the other side, a Texas high school generated controversy when it permitted \n\n(21 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 18 \nits students to display preferred gender pronouns on their online profiles.2  Further examples \nabound.  In short, the use of gender-specific titles and pronouns has produced a passionate \npolitical and social debate.  All this points to one conclusion:  Pronouns can and do convey a \npowerful message implicating a sensitive topic of public concern. \nThe history of pronoun usage in American discourse underscores this point.  Following \nthe 1745 publication of Anne Fisher’s A New Grammar, the “idea that he, him and his should go \nboth ways caught on and was widely adopted.”3  But in the latter half of the twentieth century, \ngendered pronouns became imbued with new meaning.  The feminist movement came to view \nthe generic use of masculine pronouns as “a crucial mechanism for the conceptual invisibility of \nwomen.”  Carol Sanger, Feminism and Disciplinarity:  The Curl of the Petals, 27 Loy. L.A. \nL.Rev. 225, 247 n.87 (1993).  It regarded the “generic masculine pronoun” as rooted in “pre-\nexisting cultural prejudice” and subtly “influencing our perceptions and recirculating the sexist \nprejudice.”  Deborah Cameron, Feminism and Linguistic Theory 137 (2d ed. 1992); see also \nSusan A. Speer, Gender Talk:  Feminism, Discourse and Conversation Analysis 2–3 (2005).  As \na result, “feminist attempts at language reform” served as a means for “sensitiz[ing] individuals \nto ways in which language is discriminatory towards women.”  Susan Ehrlich & Ruth King, \nGender-based language reform and the social construction of meaning, 3 Discourse & Soc’y \n151, 156 (1992).  To the feminist cause, pronouns mattered.   \nAnd history tends to repeat itself.  Never before have titles and pronouns been scrutinized \nas closely as they are today for their power to validate—or invalidate—someone’s perceived sex \nor gender identity.  Meriwether took a side in that debate.  Through his continued refusal to \naddress Doe as a woman, he advanced a viewpoint on gender identity.  See Dambrot, 55 F.3d at \n1189.  Meriwether’s speech manifested his belief that “sex is fixed in each person from the \nmoment of conception, and that it cannot be changed, regardless of an individual’s feelings or \ndesires.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1469.  The “focus,” “point,” “intent,” and “communicative purpose” of \n2Alexandra Cronin, Controversy Sparks over Frisco Transgender Students’ Right to Choose Preferred\nPronouns,  LOCAL  PROFILE  (Sept.  28,  2020),  https://localprofile.com/2020/09/28/frisco-transgender-students-\npreferred-pronouns/. \n3Patricia T. O’Conner & Stewart Kellerman, All-Purpose Pronoun, N.Y. TIMES MAG. (July 21, 2009),\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26FOB-onlanguage-thtml.   \n\n(22 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 19 \nthe speech in question was a matter of public concern.  Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, 592 (6th \nCir. 2004) (citations omitted). \nAnd even the university appears to think this pronoun debate is a hot issue.  Otherwise, \nwhy would it forbid Meriwether from explaining his “personal and religious beliefs about gender \nidentity” in his syllabus?  R. 34, Pg. ID 1478, 1488–91.  No one contests that what Meriwether \nproposed to put in his syllabus involved a matter of public concern.  See Scarbrough v. Morgan \nCnty. Bd. of Educ., 470 F.3d 250, 253, 256 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that “intended speech” which \nthe plaintiff was later “unable” to make “touched on a matter of public concern”).  In short, when \nMeriwether waded into the pronoun debate, he waded into a matter of public concern.   \n2. \nBecause Meriwether was speaking on a matter of public concern, we apply Pickering \nbalancing to determine whether the university violated his First Amendment rights.  This test \nrequires us “to arrive at a balance between the interests of the [professor], as a citizen, in \ncommenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in \npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.”  391 U.S. at \n568. Here, that balance favors Meriwether.\nStart with Meriwether’s interests.  We begin with “the robust tradition of academic\nfreedom in our nation’s post-secondary schools.”  Hardy, 260 F.3d at 680; see also Keyishian, \n385 U.S. at 603 (“Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom[.]”).  That \ntradition  alone offers a strong reason to  protect  Professor Meriwether’s speech.  After all, \nacademic freedom is “a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws \nthat cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.”  Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603.  And the First \nAmendment interests are especially strong here because Meriwether’s speech also relates to his \ncore religious and philosophical beliefs.  Finally, this case implicates an additional element:  \npotentially compelled speech on a matter of public concern.  And “[w]hen speech is compelled \n. . . additional damage is done.”  Janus, 138 S. Ct. at 2464. \nThose interests are powerful.  Here, the university refused even to permit Meriwether to \ncomply  with  its  pronoun  mandate  while  expressing  his  personal  convictions  in  a  syllabus \n\n(23 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 20 \ndisclaimer.  That ban is anathema to the principles underlying the First Amendment, as the \n“proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘the \nthought that we hate.’”  Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1764 (2017) (plurality opinion) (quoting \nUnited States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).  Indeed, the \npremise that gender identity is an idea “embraced and advocated by increasing numbers of \npeople is all the more reason to protect the First Amendment rights of those who wish to voice a \ndifferent view.”  Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 660 (2000).  \nAnd this is particularly true in the context of the college classroom, where students’ \ninterest in hearing even contrarian views is also at stake.  “Teachers and students must always \nremain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, [and] to gain new maturity and understanding.”  \nSweezy, 354 U.S. at 250 (plurality opinion); see also Blum v. Schlegel, 18 F.3d 1005, 1012 (2d \nCir. 1994) (noting that “the efficient provision of services” by a university “actually depends, to \na degree, on the dissemination in public fora of controversial speech implicating matters of \npublic concern”). \nOn the other side of the ledger, Shawnee State argues that it has a compelling interest in \nstopping discrimination against transgender students.  It relies on EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris \nFuneral Homes, Inc. in support of this proposition.  884 F.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2018).  But Harris \ndoes not resolve this case.  There, a panel of our court held that an employer violates Title VII \nwhen it takes an adverse employment action based on an employee’s transgender status.  Id. at \n571, 591.4  The panel did not hold—and indeed, consistent with the First Amendment, could not \nhave held—that the government always has a compelling interest  in regulating  employees’ \nspeech on matters of public concern.  Doing so would reduce Pickering to a shell.  And it would \nallow universities to discipline professors, students, and staff any time their speech might cause \noffense.  That is not the law.  See Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 592 (1969) (“[T]he public \nexpression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to \nsome of their hearers.”).  Purportedly neutral non-discrimination policies cannot be used to \n4Title VII differs from Title IX in important respects:  For example, under Title IX, universities must\nconsider sex in allocating athletic scholarships, 34 C.F.R. § 106.37(c), and may take it into account in “maintaining \nseparate living facilities for the different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  Thus, it does not follow that principles \nannounced in the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context. \n\n(24 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 21 \ntransform institutions of higher learning into “enclaves of totalitarianism.”  Tinker, 393 U.S. at \n511.   \nTurning  to  the  facts,  the  university’s  interest  in  punishing  Meriwether’s  speech  is \ncomparatively weak.  See Hardy, 260 F.3d at 680–81.  When the university demanded that \nMeriwether refer to Doe using female pronouns, Meriwether proposed a compromise:  He would \ncall on Doe using Doe’s last name alone.  That seemed like a win-win.  Meriwether would not \nhave to violate his religious beliefs, and Doe would not be referred to using pronouns Doe finds \noffensive.  Thus, on the allegations in this complaint, it is hard to see how this would have \n“create[d] a hostile learning environment that ultimately thwarts the academic process.”  Bonnell, \n241 F.3d at 824.  It is telling that Dean Milliken at first approved this proposal.  And when \nMeriwether  employed  this  accommodation  throughout  the  semester,  Doe  was  an  active \nparticipant in class and ultimately received a high grade.  \nAs we stated in Hardy, “a school’s interest in limiting a teacher’s speech is not great \nwhen those public statements ‘are neither shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either \nimpeded  the  teacher’s  proper  performance  of  his  daily  duties  in  the classroom  or  to  have \ninterfered with the regular operation of the schools generally.’”  260 F.3d at 681 (quoting \nPickering, 391 U.S. at 572–73).  The mere “fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to \novercome the right to freedom of expression.”  Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508.  At this stage of the \nlitigation, there is no suggestion that Meriwether’s speech inhibited his duties in the classroom, \nhampered the operation of the school, or denied Doe any educational benefits.  See Bonnell, \n241 F.3d at 824.  Without such a showing, the school’s actions “mandate[] orthodoxy, not \nanti-discrimination,” and ignore the fact that “[t]olerance is a two-way street.”  Ward, 667 F.3d \nat 735.  Thus, the Pickering balance strongly favors Meriwether. \nFinally, Shawnee State and the intervenors argue that Title IX compels a contrary result.  \nWe disagree.  Title IX prohibits “discrimination under any education program or activity” based \non sex.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  The requirement  “that the discrimination  occur  ‘under  any \neducation program or activity’ suggests that the behavior [must] be serious enough to have the \nsystemic effect of denying the victim equal access to an educational program or activity.”  Davis \nv. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 652 (1999); see Pahssen v. Merrill Cmty. Sch. Dist.,\n\n(25 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 22 \n668 F.3d 356, 362 (6th Cir. 2012).  But Meriwether’s decision not to refer to Doe using feminine \npronouns did not have any such effect.  As we have already explained, there is no indication at \nthis stage of the litigation that Meriwether’s speech inhibited Doe’s education or ability to \nsucceed in the classroom.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); Doe v. Miami Univ., 882 F.3d 579, 590 (6th \nCir. 2018) (holding that a Title IX hostile-environment claim requires that one’s “educational \nexperience  [be]  permeated  with  discriminatory  intimidation,  ridicule,  and  insult  that  is \nsufficiently  severe  or  pervasive  so  as  to  alter  the  conditions  of  the  victim’s  educational \nenvironment” (cleaned up)).  Bauer even admitted that Meriwether’s conduct “was not so severe \nand pervasive that it created a hostile educational environment.”  R. 34-27, Pg. ID 1799.  Thus, \nShawnee State’s purported interest in complying with Title IX is not implicated by Meriwether’s \ndecision to refer to Doe by name rather than Doe’s preferred pronouns. \n*  *  *\nIn sum, “the Founders of this Nation . . . ‘believed that freedom to think as you will and \nto speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.’”  \nDale, 530 U.S. at 660–61 (quoting Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., \nconcurring)).  Shawnee State allegedly flouted that core principle of the First Amendment.  \nTaking the allegations as true, we hold that the university violated Meriwether’s free-speech \nrights.5 \nIII. \nMeriwether next argues that as a public university, Shawnee State violated the Free \nExercise Clause when it disciplined him for not following the university’s pronoun policy.  We \nagree. \nThe Constitution requires that the government commit “itself to religious tolerance.” \nMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civ. Rights Comm’n, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1731 (2018) (citation \nomitted).  Thus, laws that burden religious exercise are presumptively unconstitutional unless \n5The district court’s conclusions about Meriwether’s remaining free-speech claims were all premised on\nthe notion that his speech was not protected.  Because that premise was legally erroneous, we vacate all of the \ndistrict court’s free-speech holdings. \n\n(26 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 23 \nthey are both neutral and generally applicable.  Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, \n494 U.S. 872, 877–78 (1990).  To determine whether a law is neutral, courts must look beyond \nthe text and scrutinize the history, context, and application of a challenged law.  Masterpiece, \n138 S. Ct. at 1731; Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 \n(1993).  In this way, the Free Exercise Clause guards against “even subtle departures from \nneutrality on matters of religion.”  Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1731 (cleaned up). \nA. \nMeriwether has plausibly alleged that Shawnee State’s application of its gender-identity \npolicy was not neutral for at least two reasons.  First, officials at Shawnee State exhibited \nhostility to his religious beliefs.  And second, irregularities in the university’s adjudication and \ninvestigation processes permit a plausible inference of non-neutrality.6   \n1. \nState actors must give “neutral and respectful consideration” to a person’s sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1729.  When they apply an otherwise-neutral law \nwith religious hostility, they violate the Free Exercise Clause.  Id. at 1731.  In this case, “the \npleadings give rise to a sufficient ‘suspicion’ of religious animosity to warrant ‘pause’ for \ndiscovery.”  New Hope Family Servs., Inc. v. Poole, 966 F.3d 145, 163 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting \nMasterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1731).  Meriwether “was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who \nwould give full and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of \nthe circumstances in which this case was presented, considered, and decided.”  Masterpiece, \n138 S. Ct. at 1732.  And that, he at least plausibly did not receive. \nStart with one of the individuals Meriwether alleges was involved in the action against \nhim—Department  Chair  Jennifer  Pauley.    Meriwether  came  to  her  to  discuss  his  religious \nconcerns about the new policy.  Pauley might have responded with tolerance, or at least neutral \nobjectivity.  She did not.  Instead, she remarked that religion “oppresses students” and said that \n6Of course, to have standing to bring a Free Exercise claim, Meriwether must have also suffered an injury\nbecause of the non-neutrality.  Here, he claims that the non-neutrality led to his ultimate discipline.  So he has \nstanding to bring his claim. \n\n(27 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 24 \neven its “presence” at universities is “counterproductive.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1473.  Christians in \nparticular, she said, were “primarily motivated out of fear.”  Id.  In her view, “Christian doctrines \n. . . should not be taught.”  Id.  And for good measure, she added that Christian professors \n“should be banned” from teaching courses on Christianity—knowing that Meriwether had done \nso for decades.  Id.  Neutral and non-hostile?  As alleged, no.  In fact, it has the makings of the \nvery religious intolerances that “gave concern to those who drafted the Free Exercise Clause.”  \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (citation omitted). \nSo what does the university say about these statements?  It claims that Pauley was not \ninvolved in formulating, interpreting, or applying the university’s gender-identity policy, and that \nshe was not involved in the action against him.  Maybe so.  But at the motion-to-dismiss stage, \ncourts must accept the allegations as true.  And here, the complaint alleges that Pauley was \ninvolved.7 \nAnd Pauley was not the only allegedly hostile actor.  After Meriwether was disciplined, a \nunion representative presented Meriwether’s grievance to Provost Bauer—a supposedly neutral \nadjudicator.    But  Bauer  did  not  seem  so  neutral.    He  repeatedly  interrupted  the  union \nrepresentative and made clear that he would not discuss the “academic freedom and religious \ndiscrimination aspects” of the case.  R. 34-24, Pg. ID 1780.  The union representative tried to \nexplain Meriwether’s religious beliefs and the teachings of his church.  But Provost Bauer \nresponded with open laughter.8  And after the laughter, Bauer became “so uncooperative” that \nthe union representative “was not able to present the grievance” at all.  R. 34, Pg. ID 1489.  \nBauer’s  alleged  actions  and  words  demonstrated  anything  but  the  “neutral  and  respectful \nconsideration” that the Constitution demands.  Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1729.   \n7Ultimately, Meriwether bears the burden of proving that Pauley was involved in the decision-making\nprocess.  And if these were the only allegations in the complaint, this would be a much more difficult case since \nMeriwether’s assertion that Pauley was involved does not make clear how she influenced the disciplinary decision.  \nBut we need not resolve this difficult question now because Meriwether has alleged sufficient additional facts \nagainst the university to withstand a motion to dismiss.   \n8The defendants and the district court stress that Poirot’s notes referencing the open laughter state that\nBauer laughed “at some point” during the presentation, without saying precisely when.  But the complaint itself \nclarifies that the laughter occurred “[w]hen Dr. Poirot outlined the religious beliefs that Dr. Meriwether and his \nchurch hold.”  R. 34, Pg. ID 1488; accord R. 34-24, Pg. ID 1780 (discussing the laughter in the context of the \nreligious aspects of the presentation).  Pending discovery, we must accept that allegation as true. \n\n(28 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 25 \nShawnee State’s Director of Labor Relations (Bauer’s representative) then piled on when \nhe reviewed the grievance.  In his view, Meriwether’s convictions were no better—and no more \nworthy of tolerant accommodation—than religiously motivated racism or sexism.  Bauer adopted \nthis reasoning in denying Meriwether’s grievance once again. \nIf this sounds familiar, it should.  In Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Supreme Court reversed \na  decision  of  the  Colorado  Civil  Rights  Commission  when  the  Commission  made  hostile \nstatements that “cast doubt on the fairness” of the adjudication.  138 S. Ct. at 1729–30.  The \nCommission  had  said  that  “religion  has  been  used  to  justify  all  kinds  of  discrimination \nthroughout  history,”  suggesting  that  the  defendant  was  using  religion  as  a  pretext  for \ndiscrimination.  Id. at 1729.  The Supreme Court called such comments “inappropriate” and said \nthey called the Commission’s impartiality into question.  Id. at 1729–30.  That same rationale \napplies here.  Meriwether respectfully sought an accommodation that would both protect his \nreligious beliefs and make Doe feel comfortable.  In response, the university derided him and \nequated his good-faith convictions with racism.  An inference of religious hostility is plausible in \nthese circumstances.  See Poole, 966 F.3d at 168–70. \nIn sum, Meriwether has plausibly alleged that religious hostility infected the university’s \ninterpretation and application of its gender-identity policy.  See Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1730.  \nWhether this claim ultimately prevails will depend on the results of discovery and the clash of \nproofs at trial.  For now, we simply hold that Meriwether has plausibly alleged a free-exercise \nclaim based on religious hostility. \n2. \nWhile the hostility Shawnee State exhibited would be enough for Meriwether’s claim to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, Meriwether has more.  He alleges that various irregularities in the \nuniversity’s investigation and adjudication processes also permit an inference of non-neutrality.  \nWe agree. \nNot all laws that look “neutral and generally applicable” are constitutional.  Lukumi, 508 \nU.S. at 534 (“Facial neutrality is not determinative.”).  The Free Exercise Clause “forbids subtle \ndepartures from neutrality and covert suppression of particular religious beliefs.”  Id. (cleaned \n\n(29 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 26 \nup); Ward, 667 F.3d  at  738 (noting that while a law might  appear “neutral  and generally \napplicable on its face, . . . in practice [it may be] riddled with exemptions or worse [be] a veiled \ncover for targeting a belief or a faith-based practice”).  Thus, courts have an obligation to \nmeticulously scrutinize  irregularities to  determine whether a law is  being  used to  suppress \nreligious beliefs.  See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534–35; Monclova Christian Acad. v. Toledo-Lucas \nCnty. Health Dep’t, 984 F.3d 477, 481–82 (6th Cir. 2020).9  And here, that scrutiny reveals signs \nof non-neutrality.  \nFirst, the university’s alleged basis for disciplining Meriwether was a moving target.  The \nTitle  IX  report  claimed  that  Meriwether  violated  the  university’s  gender-identity  policy  by \ncreating a “hostile educational environment.”  R. 34-13, Pg. ID 1719.  Dean Milliken agreed and \nrecommended disciplining Meriwether for this “hostile environment.”  R. 34-17, Pg. ID 1742.  \nYet when Meriwether grieved his discipline, university officials conceded that Meriwether had \nnever created a hostile environment.  Instead, they said the case was about “disparate treatment.”  \nR.34-27, Pg. ID 1799.  But at oral argument, the university changed its position once again:  It\nsaid that “this really is a hostile-environment case.”  Oral Arg. 37:00–04. \nThese repeated changes in position, along with the alleged religious hostility, permit a \nplausible inference that the university was not applying a preexisting policy in a neutral way, but \nwas instead using an evolving policy as pretext for targeting Meriwether’s beliefs.  See Ward, \n667 F.3d at 736–37; see also Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534.  And it is also plausible that the re-\ninterpretation  of  the  policy  was  an  “after-the-fact  invention”  designed  to  justify  punishing \nMeriwether for his religiously motivated speech, not a neutral interpretation of a generally \n9The obligation to scrutinize irregularities is longstanding.  In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, for example, the\nSupreme Court scrutinized the application of a new city ordinance that appeared “fair on its face” only to find that it \nwas being “administered . . . with an evil eye.”  118 U.S. 356, 373–74 (1886).  The Supreme Court held that San \nFrancisco violated the Equal Protection Clause when it declined to renew the petitioner’s laundry-business license \nunder its new ordinance.  Id. at 374.  The Court held that the city acted out of discriminatory animus because the \npetitioner—a Chinese immigrant—had operated his business for twenty-two years without incident, and because \nSan Francisco tended to use its “arbitrary power” under the new ordinance to deny licenses only to Chinese \nimmigrants.   Id.  at  358  (statement  of  facts);  id.  at  366,  374  (opinion  of  the  Court).    The  Court  found  it \nconstitutionally “intolerable” that a man’s “means of living” could be disrupted by the “mere will” of a public \nofficial who harbors discriminatory animus against him.  Id. at 370.  The Equal Protection Clause does not tolerate \nirregular, discriminatory application of “neutral” laws.  Nor does the Free Exercise Clause.  \n\n(30 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 27 \napplicable policy.  See Ward, 667 F.3d at 736 (noting that “after-the-fact invention[s]” permit an \ninference of religious discrimination). \nSecond, the university’s policy on accommodations was a moving target.  Why does this \nmatter?  Because when “individualized exemptions from a general requirement are available, the \ngovernment ‘may not refuse to extend that system to cases of “religious hardship” without \ncompelling reason.’”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884).   \nWhen Dean Milliken told Meriwether that he was violating the university’s gender-\nidentity policy, Meriwether proposed a compromise:  He would address Doe using Doe’s last \nname  and  refrain  from  using  pronouns  to  address  Doe.    Dean  Milliken  accepted  this \naccommodation.  But several weeks later, she retracted the agreed-upon accommodation and \ndemanded that Meriwether use Doe’s preferred pronouns if he intended to use pronouns to refer \nto other students.  Now the university claims that its policy does not permit any religious \naccommodations.  \nThis about-face permits a plausible inference that the policy allows accommodations, but \nthe university won’t provide one here.  If this inference is supported through discovery and trial, \na jury could conclude that the university’s refusal to stick to its accommodation is “pretext for \npunishing [Meriwether’s] religious views and speech.”  Ward, 667 F.3d at 735.   \nThird, the university’s Title IX investigation raises several red flags.  On their own, these \nissues might not warrant an inference of non-neutrality.  But combined with the other allegations \nin the complaint, they provide probative “circumstantial evidence” of discrimination.  Lukumi, \n508 U.S. at 540.   \nFor  starters,  the  Title  IX  investigator  interviewed  just  four  witnesses,  including \nMeriwether  and  Doe.    She  did  not  interview  a  single  non-transgender  student  in  any  of \nMeriwether’s  classes,  nor  did  she  ask  Meriwether  to  recommend  any  potential  witnesses.  \nIndeed, except for Meriwether and Doe, not a single witness testified about any interactions \nbetween the two.  Even so, the Title IX officer concluded that Meriwether “created a hostile \nenvironment.”  R. 34-13, Pg. ID 1719. \n\n(31 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 28 \nUnder  the  university’s  policies,  a  hostile  environment  exists  only  when  “there  is \nharassing conduct that limits, interferes with or denies educational benefits or opportunities, \nfrom both a subjective (the complainant’s) and an objective (reasonable person’s) viewpoint.”  \nR.34-2, Pg. ID 1523.  But the Title IX report does not explain why declining to use a student’s\npreferred  pronouns  constitutes  harassment.    It  does  not  explain  how  Meriwether’s  conduct \ninterfered with or denied Doe or Doe’s classmates any “educational benefits or opportunities,” \nlet alone how an “objective observer” could reach such a conclusion.  R. 34-2, Pg. ID 1523.  And \nit does not grapple with Meriwether’s request for an accommodation based on his sincerely held \nreligious  beliefs.    In  short,  the  university’s  cursory  investigation  and  findings  provide \ncircumstantial evidence of “subtle departures from neutrality.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534 (citation \nomitted).  And this suggests that the “neutral . . . consideration to which [Meriwether] was \nentitled was compromised here.”  Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1729. \n3. \nThe university raises several counterarguments, none of which we find persuasive. \nFirst, the university seems to suggest that compliance with nondiscrimination laws can \nnever burden an individual’s religious beliefs under our holding in Harris Funeral Homes.  If \nthat is their argument, it mischaracterizes the case.  In Harris, a panel of our court held that Title \nVII prevented an employer from  firing  a transgender employee because of the employee’s \ntransgender status.  884 F.3d at 574–75.  The employer believed that the law burdened the free \nexercise of his religion because he would have to endorse the mutability of sex to comply.  Id. at \n589. The panel explained that even if the belief were sincere, that did not resolve the question.\nId.  And ultimately, the panel determined that compliance with Title VII did not burden the \nemployer’s  religious  beliefs  because  “requiring  the  [employer]  to  refrain  from  firing  an \nemployee with different . . . views . . . does not, as a matter of law, mean that [the employer] is \nendorsing or supporting those views.”  Id.  As the university would have it, that means that \ncompliance with a nondiscrimination law can never amount to coerced endorsement of contrary \nreligious views.   \n\n(32 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 29 \nThat is not what we said, and that is not the law.  Depending on the circumstances, the \napplication of a nondiscrimination policy could force a person to endorse views incompatible \nwith his religious convictions.  And a requirement that an employer not fire an employee for \nexpressing a transgender identity is a far cry from what we have here—a requirement that a \nprofessor affirmatively change his speech to recognize a person’s transgender identity.  The \nuniversity itself recognizes that Harris was careful not to require an “endorsement regarding the \nmutability of sex.”  Defendants’ Br. at 46; see Harris, 884 F.3d at 589.  Remember, too, that \nMeriwether proposed a compromise:  He would consider referring to students according to their \nself-asserted gender identity if he could also include a note in the syllabus about his religious \nbeliefs on the issue.  The university said no; Meriwether would violate the policy even by \ndisclaiming a belief in transgender identity.  It cannot now argue that the policy did not require \nMeriwether to endorse a view on gender identity contrary to his faith.  \nNext, the intervenors submit that because Milliken “issued [the] written warning,” and \nbecause “there is no allegation that Milliken harbored any animus toward plaintiff’s religious \nbeliefs,” Meriwether’s free-exercise claim must fail.  Intervenors’ Br. at 52.  Why?  Because the \noriginal disciplinary decision was not the product of animus.  But that argument is both factually \nand legally flawed.   \nAccording  to  the  facts  in  the  complaint,  Milliken  did  not  issue  the  warning.    She \nrecommended it, but Bauer imposed the punishment and notified Meriwether of it.  And in any \ncase,  Masterpiece  forecloses  this  argument:    A  disciplinary  proceeding  that  is  fair  at  the \nbeginning still violates the Free Exercise Clause if it is influenced by religious hostility later.  In \nMasterpiece, the Colorado Civil Rights Division, like Milliken, first “found probable cause that \nPhillips violated [the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act] and referred the case to the Civil Rights \nCommission.”  138 S. Ct. at 1726.  An ALJ then “ruled against Phillips and the cakeshop.”  Id.  \nAnd the Commission, like Bauer, “affirmed the ALJ’s decision in full.”  Id.  Neither the Civil \nRights Division nor the ALJ exhibited any hostility.  But the Commission was hostile, and that \nwas enough.  Id. at 1725, 1729–30.  It doesn’t matter that some stages of a proceeding are fair \nand neutral if others are not.  What matters is whether unconstitutional animus infected the \nproceedings.   \n\n(33 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 30 \nFinally, the university argues that Meriwether simply could have complied with the \nalternative it offered him:  Don’t use any pronouns or sex-based terms at all.  This offer, the \nuniversity says, would not violate Meriwether’s religious beliefs.  But such an offer has two \nproblems.  First, it would prohibit Meriwether from speaking in accordance with his belief that \nsex and gender are conclusively linked.  See Riley v. Nat’l Fed’n of Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 796 \n(1988) (explaining that the “difference between compelled speech and compelled silence . . . is \nwithout constitutional significance”).  And second, such a system would be impossible to comply \nwith, especially in a class heavy on discussion and debate.  No “Mr.” or “Ms.”  No “yes sir” or \n“no ma’am.”  No “he said” or “she said.”  And when Meriwether slipped up, which he inevitably \nwould (especially after using these titles for twenty-five years), he could face discipline.  Our \nrights do not hinge on such a precarious balance.   \nThe effect of this Hobson’s Choice is that Meriwether must adhere to the university’s \northodoxy (or face punishment).  This is coercion, at the very least of the indirect sort.  And we \nknow  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  protects  against  both  direct  and  indirect  coercion.    Trinity \nLutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2022 (2017); see also McDaniel \nv. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 633 (1978) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (The “proposition—that\nthe law does not interfere with free exercise because it does not directly prohibit religious \nactivity, but merely conditions eligibility for office on its abandonment—is . . . squarely rejected \nby precedent.”).  Simply put, the alternative the university offered does not save its policy. \nB. \nFor the reasons just explained, Meriwether has plausibly alleged that Shawnee State \nburdened  his  free-exercise  rights.    Thus,  we  apply  “the  most  rigorous  of  scrutiny”  to  the \nuniversity’s actions.  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546.  We uphold them only if they “advance interests \nof the highest order” and are “narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.”  Id. (cleaned up).  \nThe university does not even argue that its application of the policy meets this standard.  Thus, \nwe hold that Meriwether’s free-exercise claim may proceed.10 \n10Because the complaint sufficiently alleges non-neutrality, we need not consider the harder question of\nwhether Employment Division v. Smith applies.  Meriwether argues that because the university’s speech regulations \n\n(34 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 31 \nIII. \nMeriwether’s final claim is that the policy is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.  \nThe Supreme Court has told us that a policy is so vague as to violate due process when it either \n(1)fails to inform ordinary people what conduct is prohibited, or (2) allows for arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983).  The standards \ndepend on the legal context:  There is “substantially more room for imprecision in regulations \nbearing only civil, or employment, consequences, than would be tolerated in a criminal code.”  \nDade v. Baldwin, 802 F. App’x 878, 885 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, \n159–60  (1974)  (plurality  opinion);  Vill.  of  Hoffman  Estates  v.  Flipside,  Hoffman  Estates, \n455 U.S. 489, 498–99 (1982)).  Even where First Amendment values are at stake, “employment \nstandards ‘are not void for vagueness as long as ordinary persons using ordinary common sense \nwould be notified that certain conduct will put them at risk’” of discipline.  Dade, 802 F. App’x \nat 885 (quoting San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 961 F.2d 1125, 1136 (3d Cir. 1992)); see Arnett, \n416 U.S. at 158–61 (plurality opinion).  Finally, our analysis must turn on the “particular facts at \nissue, for a plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of \nthe vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.”  Holder v. Humanitarian Law \nProject, 561 U.S. 1, 18–19 (2010) (cleaned up). \nLooking to the particular facts here, Meriwether was on notice that the policy prohibited \nhis conduct.  As Meriwether alleges, the policy prohibits gender-identity discrimination, with \ngender-identity being defined to include “how individuals perceive themselves and what they \ncall themselves.”  R. 34-2, Pg. ID 1522.  When Meriwether asked the university administrators \nfor guidance, they ultimately told him he had to use Doe’s preferred pronouns.  And when he \ndidn’t comply, they disciplined him.  Since he was clearly on notice that the policy  applied to \nhis conduct, he may not challenge it for vagueness.  See Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 755–56 \n(1974).   \nare “at odds with our nation’s history and traditions,” they are not subject to  Smith’s neutral-and-generally-\napplicable test.  See Appellant Br. 45 (citing Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, \n565 U.S. 171, 190 (2012)).  If resolving the applicability of Smith becomes necessary as this suit progresses, the \ndistrict court should do so in the first instance. \n\n(35 of 36)\nNo. 20-3289  Meriwether v. Hartop, et al.  Page 32 \nMeriwether also failed to argue that the policy allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement.  His conclusory assertion that the policy gives officials “unbridled discretion” in \nenforcement does not cut it.  R. 34, Pg. ID 1465.  And to the extent that he developed the point a \nbit more in his reply brief, that does not suffice.  Sanborn v. Parker, 629 F.3d 554, 579 (6th Cir. \n2010).  Thus, Meriwether’s argument that the policy allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory \nenforcement fails as well.   \nIV. \nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court’s due-process holding, reverse \nits free-speech and free-exercise holdings, vacate its dismissal of the state-law claims, and \nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n\n(36 of 36)\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 20-3289 \nNICHOLAS K.

Meriwether, by and through counsel, and for his Verified \nComplaint against Defendants, hereby states as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The cornerstone of higher education is the ability of professors to participate \nfreely in the “marketplace of ideas,” where all viewpoints can be heard and debated \non  their  merits.  That  marketplace  depends  on  free  and  vigorous  debate  among \nprofessors and students, a debate that is often reflected in an individual speaker’s \nchoice of rhetoric. But at campuses throughout the country, this marketplace of ideas \n1 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 2 of 52  PAGEID #: 1458\n \nis under attack. All too often, university officials—including those at Shawnee State \nUniversity (“University”)—use a myriad of different policies to silence, censor, and \nrestrict those who express ideas to which they or others object. \n2.  Seeking to participate in this marketplace, Dr. Nicholas Meriwether became \na philosophy professor at the University. As such, he desires to help students seek \nknowledge, wisdom, and truth; to challenge them to think deeply and critically about \nthe issues of the day; and to gain a more accurate and thoughtful perspective on \nhuman nature, how we should live, and how we should govern ourselves. In the \nprocess, he presents his own views on these issues and communicates consistently \nwith them.  \n3.  In January 2018, a male student demanded that Dr. Meriwether address him \nas a woman because he identified as such and threatened to have Dr. Meriwether \nfired if he declined. To accede to these demands would have required Dr. Meriwether \nto communicate views regarding human nature and gender identity that he does not \nhold, that he does not wish to communicate, and that would contradict (and force him \nto violate) his sincerely held Christian beliefs. Thus, he declined but offered to use \nwhatever proper name the student preferred to accommodate this student and to \nmake him feel as comfortable as possible without violating his own deeply-held beliefs \nand convictions. \n4.  Unsatisfied, the student complained to the University. Rather than allowing \nthe student and Dr. Meriwether to communicate their views as they each chose, the \nUniversity sought to silence Dr. Meriwether and punished him for expressing views \nthat  differ  from  its  own  orthodoxy  and  for  declining  to  express  its  mandated \nideological message. Continuing in their role as the self-appointed grammar police, \nDefendants threaten to punish him again if he continues to express his views. Under \ntheir policies, all professors must refer to each student—both in and out of class—\nusing whatever pronouns the student claims reflect his gender identity. They demand \n2 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 3 of 52  PAGEID #: 1459\n \nthis even though the concept of gender identity is entirely subjective and fluid, even \nthough the number of potential gender identities is infinite (with over one hundred \ndifferent  options  currently  available),  and  even  though  the  number  of  potential \npronouns has likewise multiplied in recent years—all for the purpose of lending \ncredence to cultural ideas Dr. Meriwether does not share or wish to advance.  \n5.  Defendants have retaliated against Dr. Meriwether for exercising his First \nAmendment rights, have violated his First Amendment rights to free speech and free \nexercise of religion, have violated the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, have \ndeprived him of due process and equal protection of law, have denied him his right to \nexercise his religion under the Ohio constitution, and have breached their contract \nwith him. Thus, this action concerns the denial of Dr. Meriwether’s fundamental and \nclearly established rights under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the \nFirst Amendment, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the Due Process and \nEqual Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article I § 7 of the Ohio \nConstitution.  \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n6.  This civil rights action raises federal questions under the United States \nConstitution,  particularly  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments,  and  the  Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n7.  This Court has original jurisdiction over these federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.   \n8.  This Court has authority to award the requested damages pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343; the requested declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02; the \nrequested injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and FED. R. CIV. P. 65; and \ncosts and attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims made \nherein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  \n3 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 4 of 52  PAGEID #: 1460\n \n10.  Venue is proper in this district and division pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nand S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 82.1 because Defendants reside in this district and division \nand/or all of the acts described in this Complaint occurred in this district and division. \nPLAINTIFF \n11.

Each and every Defendant is sued in his or her official capacity.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Defendants’ Unconstitutional Nondiscrimination Policies \n53.  Shawnee State University is a public four-year college in the University \nSystem of Ohio and receives funding from the State of Ohio in order to operate. \n54.  University  officials  are  bound  by  the  policies  adopted  by  the  Trustee \nDefendants and the University president. \n55.  Defendants have adopted and enforced a series of policies that govern faculty \nexpression,  including  the  following  (hereinafter  collectively,  “Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies”), portions of which Dr. Meriwether challenges: \na.  Defendants’ Non-Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy, a true, \naccurate, and correct copy of which is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit \n1; and  \nb.  Defendants’  policy  entitled  Reporting  &  Investigating  Sexual  Assault, \nSexual Misconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination, a true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of which is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 2.  \n56.  Dr.  Meriwether  challenges  as-applied  the  provisions  of  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies that prohibit and define “gender identity” discrimination. \nSee infra ¶¶ 61–85. \n57.  Dr. Meriwether challenges as-applied the disciplinary actions taken against \nhim pursuant to Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n8 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 9 of 52  PAGEID #: 1465\n \n58.  Dr.  Meriwether  challenges  facially  the  inclusion  of  “gender  identity”  in \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies because this results in vague and overbroad \nrestrictions  upon  his  protected  expression  and  grants  Defendants  unbridled \ndiscretion  to  restrict  (or  punish  him  for)  his  protected  expression,  among  other \nconstitutional flaws.  \n59.  The  Trustee  Defendants  approved  and  adopted  the  University’s  Non-\nDiscrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy. See Ex. 1 at 1. \n60.  Defendants’ policy entitled Reporting & Investigating Sexual Assault, Sexual \nMisconduct  &  Other  Forms  of  Discrimination  was  approved  by  the  University \npresident. See Ex. 2 at 1.  \n61.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies “serve[] to ensure that there are \nUniversity structures and processes in place that prohibit discrimination against any \nindividual because of . . . gender identity. . . .” Ex. 1 at 1; accord Ex. 2 at 1 (noting \nthat Defendants’ policy entitled Reporting & Investigating Sexual Assault, Sexual \nMisconduct & Other Forms of Discrimination “serves to implement the . . . provisions \nof Policy 5.01 [i.e., Ex. 1]).  \n62.  If Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies are violated, the University “will \ntake steps, whether individual or systemic, to stop the alleged . . . discrimination, \nprevent  its  recurrence,  eliminate  any  hostile  environment,  and  remedy  the \ndiscriminatory effects on the complainant and others.” Ex. 2 at 11 ¶ 17.0.  \n63.  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  define  “sex  and  gender  based \ndiscrimination” to include “[n]egative or adverse treatment based on . . . gender \nidentity . . . and the treatment denies or limits the individual’s ability to obtain the \nbenefits of Shawnee State’s programs or activities.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.3. \n64.  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  define  “gender  identity”  as  a \n“person’s  innermost  concept  of  self  as  male  or  female  or  both  or  neither—how \nindividuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.4. \n9 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 10 of 52  PAGEID #: 1466\n \n65.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies note that “[o]ne’s gender identity can \nbe the same or different than the sex assigned at birth.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶ 18.4. \n66.  Under  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies,  students  may  select  any \ngender identity they choose because the selection is based entirely on an individual \nstudent’s subjective feelings.  \n67.  Defendants  claim  that  “[t]here  are  a  wide  range  of  gender  identities, \nincluding  man,  woman,  transgender,  genderqueer,  etc.”  A  true,  accurate,  and \ncomplete  copy  of  the  LGBTQIA  webpage  from  Defendants’  Campus  Counseling \nServices Office is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 3.  \n68.  By using the term “genderqueer,” Defendants claim that there are an infinite \nvariety of gender identities because they define this term to mean a person “whose \ngender identity is neither woman or man, both woman and man, somewhere in \nbetween, or is some combination of genders.” Ex. 3 at 4.  \n69.  Defendants note that gender identity is completely subjective, saying that \n“[s]ince gender identity is internal, one’s gender identity is not necessarily visible to \nothers.” Ex. 3 at 4.  \n70.  Currently, some sources say that there are over one hundred different options \nfor one’s gender identity, including ones that “refuse[] to be categorized,” that are \n“affected by mood swings,” or that “change[] depending on which friend you’re with.”1 \n71.  Those sources say that this “is an on-going list of gender identities” and that \neach individual can customize his gender identity by “mix[ing] and match[ing] your \nown prefixes and suffixes to create the identity that best describes you.”2 \n72.  Other sources note that the number of possible gender identities is infinite.3 \n                                                            \n1   See, e.g., Genderfluid Support, available at http://genderfluidsupport.tumblr.com/ \ngender (last visited Jan. 28, 2019). \n2   Id. \n3   See, e.g., Marco A. Hildalgo, Diane Ehrensaft, et al., The Gender Affirmative \nModel:  What We Know and What We Aim to Learn, 56 HUM. DEV. 285, 288 (2013) \n10 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 11 of 52  PAGEID #: 1467\n \n73.  Under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, students may demand that \nprofessors refer to them by any pronoun they choose, from the standard English \npronouns (e.g., “he” or “she”), to the standard pronouns applied in a nonstandard way \n(e.g., “they” used to refer to one person), to those invented within the last few years \n(e.g., “ze,” “zie,” “sie,” “hir,” “hirs,” “zie,” “xe,” “xem,” “xyr,” “xyrs,” “per,” “ve,” “ver,” \n“vis,” “fae,” “faer,” “ae,” “aer,” “e,” “ey,” “em,” “eir,” “eirs,” “tey,” “ter,” “tem,” “ters”),4 \nto any others a student idiosyncratically requests.   \n74.  According  to  some  sources,  the  number  of  possible  pronouns  is  infinite \nbecause “[a]ny combination is possible.”5 \n75.  Under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, professors have two choices \nwhen referring to students:  (1) eliminate all sex-based titles and all pronouns when \nspeaking to all students, which is impossible, impractical, and unreasonable given \nthe way professors speak, particularly in classes that feature significant and frequent \nclass discussion; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s gender identity, even \nthough that gender identity may change from day to day, may change based on which \nfriends the student is with, or may change based on the student’s mood, among other \npossibilities.  \n76.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies specify that “[s]exual harassment \ncan take two forms—quid pro quo or hostile environment.” Ex. 2 at 12 ¶18.6.2. \n77.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies define “hostile environment in the \neducational context” to include “any situation in which there is harassing conduct \nthat limits, interferes with or denies educational benefits or opportunities, from both \n                                                            \n(advocating  for  “self-acceptance  within  an  infinite  variety  of  authentic  gender \nselves”).  \n4   See, e.g., Univ. of Wis., Milwaukee, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Res.

Defendants  use  the  definition  of  “hostile  environment”  from  this  sexual \nharassment provision when assessing claims of gender identity discrimination. \n79.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies specify that the “determination of \nwhether an environment is ‘hostile’ is based on the totality of the circumstances.” Ex. \n2 at 13 ¶ 18.6.2.2. \n80.  Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies define “gender identity” using such \nelusive and subjective terminology that they give professors no notice as to what \nconstitutes gender identity, what constitutes gender identity discrimination, and how \nto avoid charges of such discrimination.  \n81.  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  provide  no  objective  guidelines, \nstandards, or criteria for University officials to use when deciding what constitutes \ngender identity or gender identity discrimination, thereby granting those officials \nunbridled discretion to restrict expression.  \n82.  Defendants, by policy and practice, apply their Nondiscrimination Policies to \nregulate the expression of individual faculty members. \n83.  Defendants, by policy and practice, apply their Nondiscrimination Policies to \nregulate all interactions professors have with students, whether in the classroom or \noutside of it.  \n84.  If  a  full-time  faculty  member  violates  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination \nPolicies, he is subject to discipline under the policies outlined in “the article titled \n‘Complaint  Resolution  and  Disciplinary  Process’  in  the  collective  bargaining \nagreement  between  the  University  and  the  Shawnee  Education  Association \n[hereinafter, ‘Union’].” Ex. 2 at 10 ¶ 16.2.1.1.

Defendants’ Enforcement of Their Unconstitutional Policies  \nA. Dr. Meriwether’s Theological Beliefs \n86.  Dr. Meriwether is a professing evangelical Christian and a member of the \nPresbyterian Church of America, who strives to live out his faith on a daily basis.  \n87.  Dr. Meriwether’s Christian faith governs the way he thinks about human \nnature, marriage, gender, sexuality, morality, politics, and social issues, and it causes \nhim to hold sincerely-held religious beliefs in these areas.  \n88.  Dr. Meriwether’s convictions concerning human nature, the purpose and \nmeaning of life, and ethical standards that are to govern human conduct are drawn \nfrom the Bible.  \n89.  Dr. Meriwether believes that God created human beings as either male or \nfemale, that this sex is fixed in each person from the moment of conception, and that \nit cannot be changed, regardless of an individual’s feelings or desires.  \n90.  Dr. Meriwether also believes he cannot affirm as true ideas and concepts that \nare not true, as this would violate Biblical injunctions against dishonesty and lying.  \n91.  Dr. Meriwether also believes that he is required to treat each person with \ndignity, love, and care, as each is an individual created in the image of God.  \n92.  Because of his sincerely held religious beliefs, Dr. Meriwether objects to \ncommunicating  a  University-mandated  ideological  message  regarding  gender \nidentity that he does not believe, that he does not wish to communicate, and that \ncontradicts (and would force him to violate) his sincerely held religious beliefs. \nB. Dr. Meriwether’s Distinguished Career at Shawnee State University \n93.  In  the  fall  of  1996,  Dr.  Meriwether  joined  the  University  faculty  as  an \nassistant professor in the Department of English and Humanities.  \n94.  In  1999,  Dr.  Meriwether  was  promoted  to  associate  professor  at  the \n13 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 14 of 52  PAGEID #: 1470\n \nUniversity and received a continuing contract, which at the time was the same as \nobtaining tenure. \n95.  In 2011, Dr. Meriwether was promoted to full professor at the University.  \n96.  On three separate occasions between 2010 to the present, Dr. Meriwether has \nalso taught philosophy classes in German as a Gastdozent (i.e., guest lecturer) at the \nPädagogische Hochschule in Ludwigsburg, Germany.  \n97.  In  2017,  Dr.  Meriwether  taught  two  courses  in  Berlin,  Germany  with \nWestern Kentucky University’s Kentucky Institute for International Studies.  \n98.  At the University, Dr. Meriwether has focused his scholarship and teaching \non the intersection of philosophy, ethics, religion, and political theory. \n99.  As a graduate student, Dr. Meriwether specialized in the areas of ethics, \nsocial and political philosophy, and the history of philosophy. \n100. At  the  University,  Dr.  Meriwether  teaches  or  has  taught  a  variety  of \nphilosophy courses, including the following:   \na.  Ethics: focusing on human flourishing, natural law, and the split between \npre-modern and modern approaches to ethics; \nb.  Political Philosophy: surveying the great political ideas from Plato to \nRawls, including a survey of Reformation political thought. \nc.  Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: examining the historical engagement \nof the three religions, the question of religious militancy, and apologetical \nissues. \nd.  Ethics and Technology in the 21st Century: focusing on issues of bioethics \nand biotechnology. \ne.  History of Christian Thought: examining the development of Christian \ndoctrine from the early church to the modern period. \nf.  Introduction  to  Philosophy:    covering  the  major  ideas  of  Western \nphilosophy  chronologically  from  Plato  to  Nietzche,  with  a  special \n14 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 15 of 52  PAGEID #: 1471\n \nemphasis on the development of modern philosophy from Descartes and \nHume to Kant.   \n101. During his career at the University, Dr. Meriwether has also published at \nleast four scholarly articles and a review essay and presented at a minimum of eleven \nscholarly conferences.  \n102. For the past several years, Dr. Meriwether has been researching and writing \na multi-volume work that examines the intersection of philosophy, ethics, religion, \nand political theory from the standpoint of historic Reformed theology. One volume \nis currently under review for publication as a stand-alone work.  \n103. At  the  University,  Dr.  Meriwether  has  served  on  the  Faculty  Senate \n(including serving as its vice president at one time); led multiple study-abroad trips; \ndesigned a baccalaureate degree program in Philosophy and Religion; introduced a \nminor in Philosophy program; served on various committees; and hosted, moderated, \nand spoken at numerous panels and colloquia.  \n104. Over the course of his career, Dr. Meriwether has belonged to the American \nPhilosophical Association, the Society of Christian Philosophers, and the Evangelical \nPhilosophy Society.  \n105. Before the spring of 2018, Dr. Meriwether was never the subject of any \nUniversity disciplinary actions.  \nC. Dr.  Meriwether’s  Unsuccessful  Efforts  in  2016  to  Persuade \nDefendants to Respect First Amendment Rights  \n106. In August 2016, Dr. Meriwether received an e-mail from Union president \nChip Poirot, regarding the U.S. Department of Education’s recent “Dear Colleague” \nletter and how it addressed issues related to transgenderism. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail string is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 5. (In \nFebruary 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education \n15 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 16 of 52  PAGEID #: 1472\n \n“decided to withdraw and rescind” this “Dear Colleague” letter.6) \n107. In these e-mails, Dr. Poirot informed faculty members that they could face \ndisciplinary action from the University if they “refused to use a [student’s] requested \nname or pronoun.” Ex. 5 at 6–7.  \n108. Dr. Poirot also indicated that these restrictions on how professors speak could \napply outside the classroom. Ex. 5 at 7.  \n109. During a presentation on this issue, Dr. Poirot told faculty members that if \nthey did not heed these restrictions, they could be suspended or dismissed.  \n110. Shortly before October 27, 2016, Dr. Meriwether wrote Defendant Milliken, \nasking  what  University  policies  required  of  faculty  on  issues  related  to  gender \nidentity.  \n111. On October 27, 2016, Defendant Milliken visited Dr. Meriwether’s office to \nanswer his questions. \n112. Defendant Milliken stated that Dr. Meriwether must utilize a student’s \npreferred pronoun, regardless of what pronoun the student requested he use and \nregardless of the professor’s convictions or views on the subject.  \n113. Defendant Milliken stated that a professor’s academic freedom and free \nspeech rights has no bearing on whether he must use a pronoun that reflects a \nstudent’s self-asserted gender identity.  \n114. Defendant  Milliken  stated  that  a  professor  would  be  subject  to \nadministrative disciplinary procedures if he refused to use a pronoun that reflects a \nstudent’s self-asserted gender identity.  \n115. Dr. Meriwether asked whether the University had any policies that outlined \nhow professors must respond to a student’s demand to use a pronoun that reflects \n                                                            \n6   U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., “Dear Colleage” Letter, Feb. 22, 2017, \navailable  at  https://www.hlregulation.com/files/2017/02/colleague-201702-title-ix1-\n1.pdf (last visited Jan. 28, 2019).  \n16 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 17 of 52  PAGEID #: 1473\n \nthat student’s self-asserted gender identity.  \n116. Defendant Milliken stated that the University does not need to have policies \non this subject because students have a right to be referred to by their self-asserted \ngender identity and faculty must comply or be disciplined. \n117. Sometime around November 3, 2016, Defendant Pauley discussed issues \nrelated to transgenderism and gender identity with Dr. Meriwether. \n118. During  this  meeting,  Defendant  Pauley  claimed  that  adherents  to  the \nChristian religion are primarily motivated out of fear. \n119. Defendant Pauley also claimed that the Christian doctrines regarding hell \nare harmful and should not be taught and that anyone who believes hell exists should \nnot be allowed to teach these doctrines. \n120. Defendant Pauley also stated that faculty members who adhere to a certain \nreligion should be banned from teaching courses regarding that religion. \n121. Defendant Pauley stated that the purpose of higher education is to liberate \nstudents, that religion oppresses students, and thus, the presence of religion in higher \neducation is counterproductive.  \n122. In saying these things, Defendant Pauley exhibited hostility toward Dr. \nMeriwether and his religious beliefs.  \n123. On November 7, 2016, Dr. Meriwether sent Defendant Milliken an e-mail, \nasking to see the University’s written policies on this subject. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 6.  \n124. That same day, Defendant Milliken e-mailed Dr. Meriwether to say “there is \nno formal policy specific to transgender students, faculty, or staff at the [U]niversity. \nHowever, the [U]niversity does have a non-discrimination policy that includes ‘gender \nidentity.’  (See  policy  5.01  and  its  reporting  procedure  5.01:02  [i.e.,  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies].)” Ex. 6 at 1.   \n   \n17 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 18 of 52  PAGEID #: 1474\n \nD. Dr. Meriwether’s Ill-Fated Efforts to Exercise His First Amendment \nRights in 2018 and Defendants’ Initial Reactions  \n125. In January 2018, Dr. Meriwether returned from a semester-long sabbatical \nand began teaching a new set of classes, including Political Philosophy.  \n126. In his classes, Dr. Meriwether regularly calls on students to answer questions \nabout the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions. In any given class \nperiod, Dr. Meriwether may call upon five to ten students, and he calls on all students \nseveral times over the course of a semester. To him, using the Socratic method of \ninstruction is fundamental to teaching philosophy because it helps students learn to \ndefend their positions, allows flawed reasoning to be identified, and increases the \nlevel of engagement with the concepts being taught.  \n127. However, a student’s grade does not depend on how frequently he or she \nspeaks in class. Rather, a student satisfies the participation component of the course \nsimply by being prepared to give his or her answers to the assigned study questions \nwhen called upon to do so.  \n128. On  January  9,  2018,  during  the  first  class  of  Political  Philosophy,  Dr. \nMeriwether responded to a question from a student, Doe, by saying, “Yes, sir.” \n129. This class was the first time Dr. Meriwether interacted with Doe. \n130. Dr. Meriwether responded in this fashion because Doe is male. \n131. Dr. Meriwether responded in this fashion also because Doe appeared male to \nthe point that, in Dr. Meriwether’s opinion, no one upon seeing Doe would have \nassumed that he was female (i.e., that he was biologically female).  \n132. Before this interaction, Dr. Meriwether had received no information from the \nUniversity indicating Doe’s sex or gender identity. \n133. Since the early 1990s, Dr. Meriwether has referred to all students in his \nclasses by their last names and a title (i.e., “Mr.,” “Ms.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss”) and as “sir” \nor “ma’am.”  \n134. Dr. Meriwether has always used the titles and pronouns that refer to a \n18 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 19 of 52  PAGEID #: 1475\n \nstudent’s biological sex. \n135. Dr. Meriwether has never knowingly used feminine titles and pronouns to \nrefer to men or masculine titles and pronouns to refer to women.  \n136. Dr. Meriwether refers to students in this fashion to foster an atmosphere of \nseriousness and mutual respect that is befitting the college classroom. \n137. Dr. Meriwether believes that this formal manner of addressing students \nhelps them view the academic enterprise as a serious, weighty endeavor. \n138. Dr. Meriwether has also found that addressing students in this fashion helps \nthem learn how to accept and discuss in a respectful fashion the different (and often \nopposing) views many of their fellow students hold on controversial issues.  \n139. Dr. Meriwether has found that addressing students in this fashion is an \nimportant pedagogical tool in all of his classes, but especially in Political Philosophy \nwhere  he  and  students  discuss  many  of  the  most  controversial  issues  of  public \nconcern.  \n140. After class on January 9, 2018, Doe approached Dr. Meriwether, stated that \nhe  was  transgender  (i.e.,  that  he  identified  as  female),  and  demanded  that  Dr. \nMeriwether refer to him as a woman (i.e., with feminine titles and pronouns).  \n141. After a brief hesitation, Dr. Meriwether responded by saying that he was not \nsure he could comply with Doe’s demand and that he was not sure students can \ndictate how professors must refer to them.  \n142. At this point, Doe became belligerent, circling around Dr. Meriwether and \ngetting in his face in a threatening fashion. \n143. While doing this, Doe told Dr. Meriwether, “Then I guess this means I can \ncall you a cunt.”   \n144. Before walking away, Doe promised to see to it that Dr. Meriwether would be \nfired if he did not accede to Doe’s demands.  \n145. That afternoon, Dr. Meriwether reported Doe’s conduct to Defendant Pauley, \n19 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 20 of 52  PAGEID #: 1476\n \nwho found it and his use of profanity appalling. \n146. Defendant Pauley then relayed her conversation with Dr. Meriwether to Dr. \nMarc Scott, a professor at the University and president of the faculty senate. \n147. The next day, fearing that Doe would behave belligerently or even violently \nin class, Dr. Meriwether asked a security guard if security personnel could be in the \nvicinity when his Political Philosophy class met again on January 11, 2018. \n148. After hearing how Doe had misbehaved, the security officer recommended \nthat Dr. Meriwether report the misbehavior to the Dean of Students. \n149. On January 10, 2018, Dr. Scott e-mailed Defendant Shoemaker, informing \nhim of the Doe matter and noting that a Title IX complaint was possible. A true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 7.  \n150. Early on the morning of January 11, 2018, Dr. Meriwether reported the \nincident to the Dean of Students via e-mail, copying Defendant Pauley. A true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 8. \n151. Later that morning, the Dean of Students e-mailed Defendant Shoemaker, \ninforming him of the e-mail she had received from Dr. Meriwether.  \n152. That  same  morning,  Defendant  Shoemaker  met  with  Doe,  apprised \nDefendant Milliken of Doe’s complaint, and advised her on how to proceed. \n153. Just  before  noon  on  January  11,  2018,  Defendant  Milliken  visited  Dr. \nMeriwether’s office to discuss this situation. \n154. Defendant Milliken advised Dr. Meriwether to begin referring to all students \nby their last names only and to eliminate all sex-based references from his expression.  \n155. Dr. Meriwether explained that referring to students by last names alone \nwould undermine the serious pedagogical environment he seeks to create because \nthat is the way people refer to one another in junior high or on an athletic team. It is \nnot the way scholars, engaged in a serious, respectful enterprise, refer to one another.  \n156. In addition, it is unreasonable, impractical, and impossible either to remove \n20 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 21 of 52  PAGEID #: 1477\n \nall pronouns from one’s speech when leading class discussions or to keep track of \nwhich pronouns to use for each student, especially when the possible pronoun options \nare so numerous and a student’s preference could change at any time.  \n157. Dr. Meriwether proposed instead that he would continue referring to all of \nhis students as he had for years, but he would accommodate Doe by referring to him \nby his last name. \n158. At  the  time,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  she  approved  this \narrangement, though she later changed her mind.  \n159. Meanwhile, Doe continued to attend Dr. Meriwether’s Political Philosophy \nclass without incident and frequently contributed to class discussions, often one to \nthree times or more per class period.  \n160. On January 25, 2018, Defendant Milliken again visited Dr. Meriwether’s \noffice to discuss the Doe matter. \n161. Defendant  Milliken  announced  that  Doe  was  not  satisfied  with  the \naccommodation that Dr. Meriwether had proposed on January 11, 2018 and had \nthreatened to file a Title IX grievance over Dr. Meriwether’s expression.  \n162. Defendant  Milliken  then  explicitly  rejected  the  accommodation  Dr. \nMeriwether proposed on January 11, 2018 (i.e., referring to Doe by his last name only \nand referring to all other students the same way Dr. Meriwether had done for years).  \n163. Defendant Milliken threatened Dr. Meriwether, stating that if he did not \ncomply with Doe’s (and now her own) demands, he would be violating Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies.  \n164. In late January or early February 2018, Dr. Eugene Burns, an official with \nthe Union and a faculty member at the University, told Dr. Meriwether that he could \nbe suspended or dismissed if he continued to refuse to refer to students using titles \nand pronouns that reflect each students’ self-asserted gender identity. \n165. During his February 1, 2018, Political Philosophy class, Dr. Meriwether \n21 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 22 of 52  PAGEID #: 1478\n \ninadvertently referred to Doe using the title “Mr.” before immediately correcting \nhimself (i.e., saying something like “Mr. Doe—I mean, Doe”). \n166. In early February 2018, Doe also spoke with Defendant Pierce, indicating \nthat his complaint had not been resolved and threatened to contact a lawyer if it was \nnot resolved quickly to his satisfaction.  \n167. Defendant Pierce then contacted Defendant Shoemaker so that further action \ncould be taken, and ultimately Defendants agreed that Defendant Milliken should \ntake the next steps.  \n168. On February 12, 2018, Defendant Milliken again visited Dr. Meriwether’s \noffice to see if he had decided how he would proceed in light of their January 25th \nconversation.  \n169. During  this  conversation,  Dr.  Meriwether  asked  Defendant  Milliken  to \nclarify what would be allowed under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. \n170. Specifically, he asked whether he would be complying with those policies if \nhe (1) referred to all students by their self-asserted gender identity and (2) placed a \ndisclaimer in his syllabus, noting that he was doing so under compulsion and setting \nforth his personal and religious beliefs about gender identity. \n171. Defendant Milliken informed Dr. Meriwether that this disclaimer approach \nwould still violate Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n172. Dr. Meriwether explained that he was willing to refer to Doe by whatever \nlegal name he preferred (i.e., first or last) without using any titles but that he was \nnot willing to refer to Doe as a woman (i.e., with feminine titles or pronouns). \n173. Dr. Meriwether also explained that he was not willing to stop referring to all \nother students by their last names and sex-based titles.  \n174. Defendant Milliken responded by saying, “Well, you know what this means.” \n175. In  saying  this,  Defendant  Milliken  threatened  Dr.  Meriwether  with \ndisciplinary action under Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n22 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 23 of 52  PAGEID #: 1479\n \n176. During the rest of the semester, Doe remained in Dr. Meriwether’s Political \nPhilosophy class. \n177. During the rest of the semester, Dr. Meriwether called on Doe regularly, \nallowing him to participate in class discussions on the same basis as any other \nstudent.  \n178. During  the  rest  of  the  semester,  Doe  participated  frequently  in  class \ndiscussions in Dr. Meriwether’s Political Philosophy class, expressing freely his views \non whatever topic the class was discussing at each given time. \n179. During the rest of the semester, Doe volunteered to speak in class and \nexpress his views, even when it was not his turn to answer the assigned study \nquestions. \n180. During the rest of the semester, Doe participated in class discussions more \noften than was required and as much as (of not more than) any other student.  \n181. During  the  rest  of  the  semester,  Doe  displayed  no  anxiety,  fear,  or \nintimidation when attending class or participating in class discussions.  \n182. At the end of the semester, Dr. Meriwether awarded Doe a high grade for the \nPolitical Philosophy class, reflecting his very good work in the class and his frequent \nparticipation in class discussions. \n183. Throughout the spring 2018 semester, Doe was never denied any of the \nbenefits of Dr. Meriwether’s Political Philosophy class.  \nE. Defendants’ Unconstitutional Disciplinary Actions & Speech Code \n1.  Defendants Investigate Dr. Meriwether \n184. In short order, Defendant Milliken followed through on her threats, threats \nthat were as old as 2016 and as new as February 12, 2018.  \n185. On February 13, 2018, Defendant Milliken sent Dr. Meriwether a letter \noutlining again her position on this matter. A true, accurate, and complete copy of \nthis letter is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 9. \n23 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 24 of 52  PAGEID #: 1480\n \n186. Defendant Milliken stated that her letter was “a formal notification that you \nare expected to comply with [Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies] by treating all \nstudents the same, irrespective of their gender identity. Ex. 9 at 1.  \n187. Defendant Milliken stated that if Dr. Meriwether continued to refuse to \naccede to Doe’s demands, “the University may conduct an investigation” and he “could \nbe subject to informal or formal disciplinary action.” Ex. 9 at 1.  \n188. On February 16, 2018, before Dr. Meriwether even had a chance to respond \nto this letter, Defendant Milliken informed him via e-mail that she had launched a \nformal investigation against him. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this e-mail \nis attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 10.  \n189. Defendant  Milliken  explained  that  she  was  launching  this  formal \ninvestigation because she had received “another complaint from a student in your \nPolitical Philosophy class.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n190. The student Defendant Milliken referenced was Doe.  \n191. Defendant  Milliken  explained  that  she  was  launching  this  formal \ninvestigation  due  to  “a  potential  violation  of  University  Policy  5.01  REV  [i.e., \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies] that addresses unlawful discrimination and \nharassment.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n192. Defendant Milliken referred the investigation to Defendants Johnson and \nShoemaker. Ex. 10 at 1. \n193. Defendant Milliken then explained that the “potential violation” came in two \nforms. Ex. 10 at 1. \n194. First, Defendant Milliken noted that Dr. Meriwether “continue[d] to address \nthis student differently than others within the class by calling her by her surname \nwhile other students are addressed as Ms. ___ or Mr. ___.” Ex. 10 at 1. \n195. Second, Defendant Milliken noted that Dr. Meriwether continued to use \nmasculine pronouns when referring to Doe. Ex. 10 at 1. \n24 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 25 of 52  PAGEID #: 1481\n \n196. In launching this formal investigation, Defendant Milliken violated several \nprovisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  \n197. The Collective Bargaining Agreement specifies that “[f]ormal actions shall be \nimposed only for just cause.” Ex. 4 at 110. \n198. The  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  then  outlines  nine  instances  that \nqualify as “just cause” for formal disciplinary action. Ex. 4 at 110–11. \n199. None of these nine instances applied to Dr. Meriwether’s expression, and yet \nDefendant Milliken commenced formal disciplinary proceedings anyway. \n200. The Collective Bargaining Agreement outlines professors’ academic freedom \nrights. Ex. 4 at 24. \n201. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes  “[f]reedom  in  their  classroom  when  discussing  subject  matter  that  is \nreasonably related to the relevant course material and established curriculum.” Ex. \n4 at 24. \n202. Many of Dr. Meriwether’s classes, including his Political Philosophy class, \nnaturally touch on controversial issues, such as questions of ethics and human \nnature. His comments about gender identity are thus reasonably related to his \nteaching and scholarship and also address matters of public concern. \n203. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes the freedom to “[c]hoose . . . pedagogical techniques.” Ex. 4 at 24. \n204. Dr. Meriwether’s manner of addressing students is a pedagogical technique \ndesigned to foster an atmosphere of seriousness and respect that is vital when \ndiscussing such controversial and hotly debated issues as gender identity. It also \ncommunicates his own views on these subjects.  \n205. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, professors’ academic freedom \nincludes the “[f]reedom to . . . speak freely . . . on educational and curricular matters \nand on matters of public concern.” Ex. 4 at 24. The issue in question is clearly a matter \n25 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 26 of 52  PAGEID #: 1482\n \nof public concern.  \n206. On February 23, 2018, Dr. Meriwether responded via e-mail to Defendant \nMilliken’s February 13th letter and February 16th e-mail. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of this response is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 11.  \n207. In his response, Dr. Meriwether noted that he was still evaluating how to \nrespond to the investigation and that he could “ultimately conclude that [he] could \nnot comply with [Defendant Milliken’s] directives due to [his] conscience, ethical or \nreligious convictions, or [his] views on free speech.” Ex. 11 at 3–4. \n208. In addition, Dr. Meriwether reminded Defendant Milliken of his sincerely \nheld religious beliefs as a Christian and explained how those beliefs impacted issues \nrelated to gender identity. Ex. 11 at 4. \n209. Dr. Meriwether also summarized the accommodation he had proposed and \nhow Defendant Milliken had rejected it. Ex. 11 at 4. \n210. Dr. Meriwether then inquired whether he would be allowed to refer to all \nstudents by their last names alone and continue to use sex-based pronouns, rather \nthan pronouns reflecting a student’s self-asserted gender identity. Ex. 11 at 4. \n211. Dr. Meriwether explained that he was not sure this accommodation would be \nacceptable to him, as it would undermine the educational environment he strived to \nachieve in his classroom, but he asked if it would comply with University policy. Ex. \n11 at 4.  \n212. On February 26, 2018, Defendant Milliken replied, explaining that under \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, Dr. Meriwether had two choices:  “calling \nevery student in your classes by his/her last name or by his/her first name.” Ex. 11 at \n2. \n213. As Defendant Milliken did not address the use of pronouns, Dr. Meriwether \nreiterated this question on March 1, 2018. Ex. 11 at 1–2. \n214. Specifically, Dr. Meriwether asked:  “Would the policy prevent me from using \n26 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 27 of 52  PAGEID #: 1483\n \nbiologically correct pronouns when referencing other students, as long as I addressed \nthe student in question using first or last name and refrained from using pronouns?” \nEx. 11 at 2. \n215. On March 12, 2018, Defendant Milliken replied:  “Every student needs to be \ntreated the same in all of your classes. In other words, the policy seeks to ensure that \nwhat is done for one student is done for all to avoid issues of discrimination. This \nregards names, pronoun usage, and most any other matter.” Ex. 11 at 1.  \n216. In sum, Defendant Milliken indicated that Dr. Meriwether would violate \nDefendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policy  (1)  if  he  referred  to  Doe  using  masculine \npronouns; or (2) if he stopped using pronouns in reference to Doe but continued to use \nsex-based pronouns for all other students; or (3) if he referred to transgender students \nby their name of choice but continued to refer to all other students by their last names \nand titles (i.e., “Mr.,” “Ms.,” “Miss,” or “Mrs.”).  \n217. Thus,  with  respect  to  names,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  Dr. \nMeriwether  had  only  two  choices  if  he  wanted  to  comply  with  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies: (1) stop referring to students by their last names and \ntitles, thereby altering the pedagogical environment in his classroom; or (2) use titles \nthat refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, which would require him to \nviolate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs. \n218. Thus,  with  respect  to  pronouns,  Defendant  Milliken  indicated  that  Dr. \nMeriwether  had  only  two  choices  if  he  wanted  to  comply  with  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination  Policies:    (1)  stop  using  pronouns  altogether,  which  is \nunreasonable and impossible, especially given the Socratic teaching style that he \nuses; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, \nwhich would require him to violate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n219. On the same day, Dr. Meriwether sent a letter to the University’s president \nand Defendant Bauer, asking them to suspend the investigation. A true, accurate, \n27 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 28 of 52  PAGEID #: 1484\n \nand complete copy of this letter is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 12. \n220. In this letter, Dr. Meriwether recounted Doe’s demands and threatening \nbehavior, his efforts to reach an accommodation with Defendant Milliken, and her \nrefusal to agree to any arrangement that would allow Dr. Meriwether to follow his \nreligious convictions. Ex. 12 at 2–3. \n221.  Dr. Meriwether also explained how launching this investigation violated the \nCollective  Bargaining  Agreement,  as  there  was  no  sufficient  basis  for  the \ninvestigation. Ex. 12 at 3.  \n222. Later  that  day,  Defendant  Bauer  responded,  refusing  to  suspend  the \ninvestigation. Ex. 12 at 1. \n223. Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Bauer  consulted  with  the \nUniversity’s president before responding to Dr. Meriwether. \n224. Upon information and belief, Defendant Bauer acted at the instruction or \nwith the approval of the University’s president when he responded to Dr. Meriwether.  \n225. On  April  12,  2018,  Defendant  Johnson  submitted  the  results  of  her \ninvestigation to Defendant Milliken. A true, accurate, and complete copy of her \ninvestigation report, as updated on May 9, 2018, is attached to this Complaint as \nExhibit 13.  \n226. Defendant Johnson’s investigation involved interviewing just four witnesses, \nincluding Doe and Dr. Meriwether. Ex. 13 at 1–2.  \n227. Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker and their staff never interviewed any \nnon-transgender students from Dr. Meriwether’s class as part of the investigation so \nas to get a more disinterested perspective on the environment in that class.  \n228. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker and their \nstaff interviewed only students that Doe recommended. \n229. Defendants  Johnson  and  Shoemaker  and  their  staff  never  asked  Dr. \nMeriwether to recommend any potential witnesses they could interview.  \n28 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 29 of 52  PAGEID #: 1485\n \n230. Defendant Johnson concluded that Dr. Meriwether’s “disparate treatment \nhas created a hostile environment” for Doe, thereby violating both of Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 13 at 1, 4.  \n231. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker consulted \nwith Defendant Pierce in conducting their investigation and in preparing Defendant \nJohnson’s investigation report. \n232. Upon information and belief, Defendants Johnson and Shoemaker acted at \nthe  instruction  or  with  the  approval  of  Defendant  Pierce  in  conducting  their \ninvestigation and in preparing Defendant Johnson’s investigation report.  \n2.  Defendants Formally Charge Dr. Meriwether \n233. On April 18, 2018, Defendant Milliken notified Dr. Meriwether that she was \npursuing a “formal charge” against him. A true, accurate, and complete copy of \nDefendant Milliken’s charge notice is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 14. \n234. In this charge notice, Defendant Milliken explained to Dr. Meriwether that, \naccording to the investigation, “your disparate treatment of the complainant in your \nclass has caused a hostile environment.” Ex. 14 at 1.  \n235. On  April  21,  2018,  Dr.  Meriwether  e-mailed  Defendants  Shoemaker, \nJohnson, and Milliken, requesting additional documentation and correcting factual \ninaccuracies  in  Defendant  Johnson’s  investigation  report.  A  true,  accurate,  and \ncomplete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 15.  \n236. On  May  8,  2018,  Dr.  Meriwether  sent  Defendant  Milliken  an  e-mail \nresponding to a timeline of events included in Defendant Johnson’s investigation \nreport, which he had not received until April 27, 2018. A true, accurate, and complete \ncopy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 16. \n237. In this e-mail, Dr. Meriwether elaborated further on his beliefs regarding \ngender identity, reiterated his objection to being forced to communicate a message he \ndoes not believe and that conflicts with his religious beliefs, and responded to some \n29 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 30 of 52  PAGEID #: 1486\n \nmisleading statements in Defendant Milliken’s timeline. Ex. 16 at 1.  \n238. On May 29, 2018, Defendant Milliken issued a report, setting forth her \nfindings after the formal investigation of Dr. Meriwether. A true, accurate, and \ncomplete copy of her report is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 17.  \n239. In her report, Defendant Milliken concluded that because Dr. Meriwether \nrefused to refer to Doe as a woman, he had violated Defendants’ Nondiscrimination \nPolicies. See Ex. 17 at 2 (“Because Dr. Meriwether repeatedly refused to change the \nway he addressed Ms. [Doe] in his class due to his views on transgender people, and \nbecause the way he treated Ms. [Doe] was deliberately different than the way he \ntreated others in his class, I found that he effectively created a hostile environment \nfor Ms. [Doe]. This is a direct violation of Policy No. 5.01REV.”). \n240. Defendant Milliken recommended punishing Dr. Meriwether by issuing a \nwritten warning. See Ex. 17 at 2 (“[I]n order to ensure a safe educational experience \nfor all students, I propose the formal action of a written warning being placed in Dr. \nMeriwether’s personnel file.”).  \n241. On June 1, 2018, Dr. Meriwether sent Defendant Bauer an e-mail correcting \nDefendant  Milliken’s  mischaracterizations  of  his  actions  towards  Doe.  A  true, \naccurate, and complete copy of this e-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit \n18. \n242. Dr. Meriwether explained to Defendant Bauer that “this whole controversy \narose because I was treating [Doe] precisely the same as I treat all other students. \nRegardless of his gender identity, [Doe] is biologically male, and I referred to him the \nsame way as I refer to all other biologically male students.” Ex. 18 at 1. \n243. Dr. Meriwether went on to note that he only started to refer to Doe differently \nin an effort to accommodate Doe’s request, that he never treated Doe differently in \nany other way, and that Doe’s “access to educational benefits and opportunities was \nnever jeopardized.” Ex. 18 at 1.  \n30 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 31 of 52  PAGEID #: 1487\n \n244. On June 14, 2018, Defendant Bauer agreed with Defendant Milliken that Dr. \nMeriwether had violated Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. A true, accurate, \nand complete copy of his decision is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 19. \n245. In  agreeing  with  Defendant  Milliken,  Defendant  Bauer  approved  her \nrecommended disciplinary action and asked her to “provide [him] with a letter of \nwarning that will be placed in [Dr. Meriwether’s] personnel file.” Ex. 19 at 2. \n3.  Defendants Sanction Dr. Meriwether & Impose a Speech Code \n246. On June 22, 2018, Defendant Milliken issued the written warning to Dr. \nMeriwether. A true, accurate, and complete copy of her warning is attached to this \nComplaint as Exhibit 20.  \n247. Defendant Milliken’s warning reiterated that Dr. Meriwether had violated \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 20 at 1.  \n248. Defendant Milliken warned Dr. Meriwether to change the way he addresses \ntransgender individuals “to avoid further corrective actions.” Ex. 20 at 1.  \n249. On June 25, 2018, Defendant Bauer formally notified Dr. Meriwether of \nDefendant Milliken’s warning via e-mail. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this \ne-mail is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 21.  \n4.  Defendants Affirm Their Disciplinary Actions & Speech Code \n250. On July 2, 2018, Dr. Meriwether submitted a grievance request to the Union, \noutlining provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that Defendants violated \nin disciplining him for his expression. A true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. \nMeriwether’s grievance request is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 22. \n251. During an August 1, 2018, conversation with Dr. Meriwether, Dr. Poirot \nwarned that if additional students filed complaints with the administration, Dr. \nMeriwether would likely be fired or suspended without pay.  \n252. On  August  16,  2018,  the  Union  submitted  a  formal  grievance  on  Dr. \nMeriwether’s behalf. A true, accurate, and complete copy of this formal grievance is \n31 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 32 of 52  PAGEID #: 1488\n \nattached to this Complaint as Exhibit 23.  \n253. In  this  grievance,  Dr.  Meriwether  asked  the  University  to  vacate  the \ndisciplinary  action  taken  against  him  and  to  allow  him  to  continue  speaking \nconsistent with his religious beliefs. Ex. 23 at 4.  \n254. On August 22, 2018, Dr. Poirot and Dr. Meriwether met with Defendant \nBauer to discuss the grievance.  \n255. Defendant Bauer, as provost, was the first official who would review Dr. \nMeriwether’s grievance.  \n256. At the meeting, Dr. Poirot attempted to explain how Defendants’ disciplinary \naction  against  Dr.  Meriwether  imperiled  his  ability  to  live  consistent  with  his \nsincerely held religious convictions, his academic freedom, and his free speech rights. \nA true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. Poirot’s account of this meeting is attached \nto this Complaint as Exhibit 24. \n257. Defendant Bauer repeatedly interrupted Dr. Poirot, clearly indicating that \nhe had no interest hearing Dr. Meriwether’s grievance. \n258. When Dr. Poirot outlined the religious beliefs that Dr. Meriwether and his \nchurch hold and how Defendants’ disciplinary actions would force Dr. Meriwether to \nviolate those teachings, Dr. Poirot noted that Defendant Bauer “openly laughed.” Ex. \n24 at 1. \n259. By  laughing,  Defendant  Bauer  displayed  open  hostility  towards  Dr. \nMeriwether and his religious beliefs. \n260. During the meeting, Dr. Poirot again inquired as to whether Dr. Meriwether \nwould be complying with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies if he (1) referred to \nall students by their self-asserted gender identity and (2) placed a disclaimer in his \nsyllabus, noting that he was doing so under compulsion and setting forth his personal \nand religious beliefs about gender identity.  \n261. Defendant Bauer dismissed this approach, indicating that even this would \n32 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 33 of 52  PAGEID #: 1489\n \nviolate Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies.  \n262. Defendant Bauer’s conduct throughout the meeting was so uncooperative \nthat Dr. Poirot “was not able to present the grievance.” Ex. 24 at 2.  \n263. Sometime after this meeting, Dr. Poirot again warned Dr. Meriwether that \nhe could be fired if he continued to refuse to refer to Doe as female. Thus, he cautioned \nDr. Meriwether to change his expression while the grievance process unfolded, saying \nthat otherwise Dr. Meriwether was running an unnecessary financial risk.  \n264. On September 5, 2018, Defendant Bauer e-mailed Dr. Meriwether stating, “I \nam denying your grievance.” A true, accurate, and complete copy of this e-mail, \nincluding  the  attached  decision  and  rationale,  is  attached  to  this  Complaint  as \nExhibit 25. \n265. On September 6, 2018, Dr. Meriwether appealed Defendant Bauer’s decision \nto the University’s president.  \n266. Shortly thereafter, the University’s president resigned and Defendant Bauer \nwas appointed interim president.  \n267. As a result, Defendant Bauer would be reviewing as interim president his \nown decision made as provost.  \n268. On September 14, 2018, Dr. Poirot and Dr. Meriwether met with Mr. David \nZender and Mr. Michael McPhillips, Defendant Bauer’s representatives, to discuss \nthe grievance. A true, accurate, and complete copy of Dr. Poirot’s notes from this \nmeeting are attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 26. \n269. On October 4, 2018, Defendant Bauer issued his decision on Dr. Meriwether’s \ngrievance in his role as interim president. A true, accurate, and complete copy of his \ndecision as interim president is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 27. \n270. Defendant  Bauer  denied  Dr.  Meriwether’s  grievance  and  adopted  Mr. \nZender’s recommended decision. Ex. 27 at 11. \n271. Defendant Bauer erroneously claimed that “this is not a hostile environment \n33 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 34 of 52  PAGEID #: 1490\n \nclaim.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n272. In  saying  this,  Defendant  Bauer  contradicted  Defendant  Johnson’s \ninvestigation report, Ex. 13 at 1, 4; Defendant Milliken’s charge notice, Ex. 14 at 1; \nand Defendant Milliken’s report outlining her findings after the investigation, Ex. 17 \nat 2.  \n273. Defendant Bauer erroneously claimed that Dr. Meriwether “refused to stop \nsingling out [Doe] because of her gender identity.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n274. In reality, Dr. Meriwether offered to accommodate Doe by referring to him by \nwhatever name Doe preferred.  \n275. Dr. Meriwether never singled out Doe for any reason, including his self-\nasserted gender identity. \n276. Defendant Bauer concluded that Dr. Meriwether discriminated against Doe \nbased on gender identity. Ex. 27 at 13. \n277. However, Defendant Bauer never explained how Dr. Meriwether’s expression \n“denie[d]  or  limit[ed]  [Doe’s]  ability  to  obtain  the  benefits  of  Shawnee  State’s \nprograms or activities.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n278. Defendant  Bauer  concluded  again  that  Dr.  Meriwether  had  violated \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies. Ex. 27 at 13.  \n279. Defendant  Bauer  concluded  that  he  could  not  grant  Dr.  Meriwether’s \nrequested religious accommodation because “it is conceivable that SSU employs or \nmay in the future employ faculty members with sincerely held religious beliefs that, \ne.g., one national origin is superior to another national origin, or one sex is inferior to \nthe other sex.” Ex. 27 at 13. \n280. That  is,  Defendant  Bauer  dismissed  Dr.  Meriwether’s  request  for \naccommodation of his religious beliefs by equating them with those of hypothetical \nracists and sexists. Ex. 27 at 13. \n281. In  so  doing,  Defendant  Bauer  displayed  open  hostility  to  Defendant \n34 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 35 of 52  PAGEID #: 1491\n \nMeriwether’s religious beliefs.  \n282. Defendant Bauer also concluded that Dr. Meriwether would still violate \nDefendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies if he were to refer to students by their self-\nasserted gender identity and include a disclaimer in his syllabus setting forth his \npersonal and religious beliefs on the subject. Ex. 27 at 13.  \n283. With respect to names, Defendant Milliken had given Dr. Meriwether only \ntwo choices if he wanted to comply with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, and \nDefendant Bauer now gave him the same two choices:  (1) stop referring to students \nby their last names and titles, thereby altering the pedagogical environment in his \nclassroom; or (2) use titles that refer to each student’s self-asserted gender identity, \nwhich would require him to violate his conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs. \n284. With respect to pronouns, Defendant Milliken had given Dr. Meriwether only \ntwo choices if he wanted to comply with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, and \nDefendant  Bauer  now  gave  him  the  same  two  choices:  (1)  stop  using  pronouns \naltogether,  which  is  unreasonable  and  impossible,  especially  given  the  Socratic \nteaching style that he uses; or (2) use pronouns that refer to each student’s self-\nasserted gender identity, which would require him to violate his conscience and \nsincerely held religious beliefs.  \nF. Effect of Defendants’ Unconstitutional Actions on Dr. Meriwether \n285. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies burden Dr. Meriwether’s constitutional rights for multiple reasons. \n286. The warning letter in his personnel file constitutes a formal disciplinary \naction that has been taken against him. Ex. 4 at 109–10. \n287. Multiple individuals familiar with the disciplinary process for faculty at the \nUniversity  have  repeatedly  warned  Dr.  Meriwether  that  he  could  be  fired  or \nsuspended without pay if he does not comply with Defendants’ Nondiscrimination \nPolicies.  \n35 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 36 of 52  PAGEID #: 1492\n \n288. For example, Dr. Burns told Dr. Meriwether that a warning letter is the first \nstep in the Defendants’ disciplinary process, but after that, Defendants do not have \nto use all other disciplinary actions. \n289. Instead, Dr. Burns told Dr. Meriwether that, after issuing a warning letter, \nDefendants could immediately fire Dr. Meriwether for any subsequent violations.  \n290. Now  that  Defendants  have  placed  a warning letter in Dr. Meriwether’s \npersonnel file, any further complaint regarding how he communicates on issues \nrelated to gender identity could result in his immediate suspension without pay or \nhis termination. \n291. Because of this threat, Dr. Meriwether has not discussed issues related to \ngender identity or transgenderism when he otherwise would have done so. \n292. For  example,  Dr.  Meriwether  has  in  the  past  included  a  presentation \nregarding transgenderism and gender identity in his Ethics class. \n293. In addition, issues related to gender identity and transgenderism often arise \nin the class discussion in his Political Philosophy classes. \n294. In addition, issues related to gender identity and transgenderism are serious \nmatters of public concern that interest many students. They also lie at the heart of \nthe distinction between modern and premodern modes of thoughts and our deepest \npolitical divisions. Thus, they would naturally arise in class discussions in many (if \nnot all) of Dr. Meriwether’s classes.  \n295. In all of these settings, Dr. Meriwether has declined to discuss substantively \nissues related to gender identity and transgenderism, has steered class discussions \nto avoid them, and has refused to address these issues when students have raised \nthem. \n296. Dr. Meriwether has assiduously avoided these issues because, now that he \nhas a warning letter in his personnel file, discussing these issues could result in his \nimmediate suspension without pay or termination.  \n36 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 37 of 52  PAGEID #: 1493\n \n297. As a result, Dr. Meriwether cannot address a high profile issue of public \nconcern that has significant philosophical implications (e.g., illustrating how modern \nsociety no longer treats the physical body and its purposes and functions as normative \nfor human behavior and examining whether this philosophical shift is well-grounded \nor beneficial for the individual and society).  \n298. Last, having a letter of warning in his file will make it difficult, if not \nimpossible,  for  Dr.  Meriwether  to  obtain  a  position  as  an  adjunct,  professor, \ninstructor, consultant, or administrator at another institution once he retires from \nthe University. \nSTATEMENTS OF LAW \n299. At all times relevant to this Complaint, each and all of the acts and policies \nalleged herein were attributed to Defendants who acted under color of a statute, \nregulation, or custom of the State of Ohio (i.e., under color of state law and authority). \n300. Defendants  knew  or  should  have  known  that  they  were  violating  Dr. \nMeriwether’s constitutional and contractual rights by: \na.  Subjecting Dr. Meriwether to disciplinary action because he spoke in a \nway that communicated his beliefs regarding gender identity; \nb.  Disciplining Dr. Meriwether by placing a warning letter in his personnel \nfile that threatens further disciplinary action if he engages in “any such \nbehaviors” in the future;  \nc.  Compelling Dr. Meriwether to speak in a way that affirms and recognizes \nas true the idea that a person can change his or her gender or identify \ndifferently than his or her sex;  \nd.  Prohibiting Dr. Meriwether from living and speaking in a way that is \nconsistent with his religious beliefs and punishing him when he tried to \ndo so;  \ne.  Refusing to grant Dr. Meriwether a religious accommodation;  \n37 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 38 of 52  PAGEID #: 1494\n \nf.  Disciplining  Dr.  Meriwether  in  violation  of  the Collective  Bargaining \nAgreement. \n301. The  policies  and  practices  that  led  to  the  violation  of  Dr.  Meriwether’s \nconstitutional and contractual rights remain in full force and effect. \n302. Dr.  Meriwether  is  suffering  irreparable  harm  from  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies and the way those policies have been enforced. \n303. Dr. Meriwether has no adequate or speedy remedy at law to correct the \ndeprivation of his rights by Defendants. \n304. Defendants’  actions  and  policies,  as  set  forth  above,  do  not  serve  any \nlegitimate or compelling state interest and are not narrowly tailored to serve any \nsuch interests. \n305. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are  not \nnarrowly tailored as applied to Dr. Meriwether because Dr. Meriwether’s expression \ndoes not implicate any of the legitimate interests Defendants might have. \n306. Unless the policies and conduct of Defendants are enjoined, Dr. Meriwether \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n307. Under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, Dr. Meriwether is entitled to appropriate \nrelief invalidating Defendants’ challenged policies and related conduct.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nRetaliation \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n308. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n309. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity both in and out of the classroom, Defendants have \nretaliated  and  are  retaliating  against  Dr.  Meriwether  for  exercising  his  First \nAmendment rights.  \n38 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 39 of 52  PAGEID #: 1495\n \n310. When Dr. Meriwether communicated his views regarding transgenderism \nthrough his choice of titles and pronouns in his interactions with students and in his \nclassroom, he was speaking on a matter of public concern, engaging in speech related \nto teaching and scholarship, and engaging in expression the First Amendment protects. \n311. Dr. Meriwether’s interest, as a professor at a public university, in discussing \nmatters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of  teaching  and  scholarship  outweighs \nDefendants’ interest in the efficient provision of services. \n312. Dr.  Meriwether’s  speech  on  matters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of \nteaching  and  scholarship  never  prevented  Defendants  from  efficiently  providing \nservices to the public (or even threatened to do so).  \n313. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies, their enforcement of those policies, \nand their threatened future enforcement of those policies would deter a person of \nordinary firmness from exercising his right to free speech in the future. \n314. Defendants  have  enforced  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  against  Dr. \nMeriwether and threaten to do so in the future at least in part because of the views \nhe  has  expressed  on  matters  of  public  concern  in  the  context  of  teaching  and \nscholarship, expression that the First Amendment protects.  \n315. Defendants subjected Dr. Meriwether to discipline and threaten to do so \nagain in the future due to the content and viewpoint of Dr. Meriwether’s speech. \n316. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nContent & Viewpoint Discrimination \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n317. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n39 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 40 of 52  PAGEID #: 1496\n \n318. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity both in and out of the classroom, Defendants have \nengaged  in  content  and/or  viewpoint  discrimination  in  violation  of  the  First \nAmendment. \n319. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  require  officials  to  evaluate  the \ncontent and viewpoint of faculty expression to determine whether it constitutes \ndiscrimination or harassment and whether it creates a hostile environment.  \n320. Defendants  considered  the  content  and  viewpoint  of  Dr.  Meriwether’s \nexpression when they decided to enforce their Nondiscrimination Policies against him \nand they threaten to do so again if he continues to express his views.  \n321. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  confer  unbridled  discretion  upon \nUniversity officials to discriminate based on content or viewpoint.  \n322. Defendants  exercised  this  unbridled  discretion  when  they  punished  Dr. \nMeriwether for expressing his views regarding gender identity.  \n323. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies are unconstitutionally overbroad because they restrict a significant amount \nof constitutionally protected speech.  \n324. The overbreadth of Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies chills the speech \nof Dr. Meriwether, who seeks to engage in protected expression in his interactions \nwith students on campus and in the classroom.  \n325. Dr. Meriwether’s expression regarding gender identity is protected by the \nFirst Amendment.  \n326. By placing a written warning in his personnel file for allegedly violating their \nNondiscrimination Policies, Defendants have punished Dr. Meriwether for engaging \nin expression the First Amendment protects. \n327. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \n40 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 41 of 52  PAGEID #: 1497\n \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n328. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n329. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for refusing to \ncommunicate a University-mandated ideological message regarding gender identity \nboth in and out of the classroom, Defendants have attempted and are attempting to \ncompel  Dr.  Meriwether’s  speech,  in  violation  of  his  rights  under  the  First \nAmendment. \n330. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies compel Dr. Meriwether to communicate messages about gender identity that \nhe does not hold, that he does not wish to communicate, and that conflict with (and \nfor him to violate) his religious beliefs. \n331. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free speech as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment Right to Free Exercise of Religion \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n332. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n333. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for exercising his \nsincerely held religious beliefs in the way he discusses issues regarding gender \nidentity both in and out of the classroom, Defendants have violated and are violating \nhis right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment. \n334. Dr.  Meriwether’s  views  and  expression  related  to  gender  identity  are \nmotivated by his sincerely held religious beliefs, are avenues through which he \n41 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 42 of 52  PAGEID #: 1498\n \nexercises his religious faith, and constitute a central component of his sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \n335. Expressing the University’s mandated message regarding gender identity \nwould require Dr. Meriwether to violate his sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n336. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are neither \nneutral nor generally applicable but allow Defendants to target religious expression \nand activities specifically and to express hostility to such expression.  \n337. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are neither \nneutral nor generally applicable because they represent a system of individualized \nassessments.  \n338. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunderinclusive, prohibiting some expression while leaving other expression equally \nharmful to the University’s asserted interests unprohibited. \n339. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices burden several \nof  Dr.  Meriwether’s  constitutional  rights,  including  his  rights  under  the  First \nAmendment  (e.g.,  freedom  of  speech,  freedom  from  retaliation,  free  exercise  of \nreligion), the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and the Fourteenth Amendment \n(e.g., due process and equal protection). \n340. Defendants violated Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion when \nthey  applied  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  to  discipline  Dr.  Meriwether  for \ncommunicating his views on issues related to gender identity and to compel him to \ncommunicate views on those same subjects that violate his religious beliefs, and they \ncontinue to do so by threatening to punish him if he continues to communicate his \nbeliefs or if he continues to refuse to communicate views on those same subjects that \nviolate his religious beliefs.   \n341. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed by \n42 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 43 of 52  PAGEID #: 1499\n \nthe First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiffs’ Right to be Free from Unconstitutional Conditions \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n342. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n343. By conditioning Dr. Meriwether’s status as a professor in good standing at \nthe University (and ultimately his employment at the University) on his willingness \nto  surrender  various  constitutional  rights,  Defendants  have  imposed  and  are \nimposing an unconstitutional condition on him in violation of his First Amendment \nrights. \n344. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies impose an unconstitutional condition upon faculty members’ right to free \nspeech and their receipt of state benefits (e.g., avoiding disciplinary actions up to and \nincluding termination, remaining a professor at a public university).  \n345. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies require faculty members to surrender their constitutionally protected rights \nto freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, due process, and equal protection to \navoid disciplinary actions up to and including termination.  \n346. Defendants  enforced  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies  against  Dr. \nMeriwether, making it clear that he can only avoid further disciplinary action if he \nsurrenders his constitutionally protected rights to freedom of speech, free exercise of \nreligion, due process, and equal protection.  \n347. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to be free from unconstitutional conditions.  \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment Right to  \nDue Process of Law \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n348. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \n43 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 44 of 52  PAGEID #: 1500\n \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n349. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether under vague and \noverbroad policies for his expression in and out of the classroom, Defendants have \nviolated and are violating Dr. Meriwether’s right to due process of law under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n350. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices are overbroad \nbecause they encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.  \n351. Dr. Meriwether’s expression regarding gender identity is protected by the \nFirst Amendment.  \n352. By placing a written warning in his personnel file for allegedly violating their \nNondiscrimination Policies, Defendants have punished Dr. Meriwether for engaging \nin expression the First Amendment protects.  \n353. Defendants’ written warning to Dr. Meriwether, issued under the authority \nof their Nondiscrimination Policies, threatens to punish him if he engages in a wide \nvariety  of  constitutionally  protected  expression  in  the  future  in  violation  of  Dr. \nMeriwether’s right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n354. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunconstitutionally vague because they grant University officials unbridled discretion \nin deciding what constitutes “gender identity” and “gender identity discrimination,” \nbecause they utilize terms that are inherently subjective and elude any precise or \nobjective definition that would be consistent from one official, professor, or student to \nanother, because they are incapable of providing meaningful guidance to Defendants \nand other University officials, and because they force professors to guess whether \nexpression that the First Amendment protects is in fact allowed on campus. \n355. The  lack  of  objective  criteria,  factors,  or  standards  in  Defendants’ \nNondiscrimination Policies and related practices renders these policies and practices \nunconstitutionally vague and in violation of Dr. Meriwether’s right to due process of \n44 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 45 of 52  PAGEID #: 1501\n \nlaw under the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment Right to  \nEqual Protection of the Law \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n356. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n357. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for expressing his \nviews regarding gender identity both in and out of the classroom when they would \nnot punish professors who express opposite views on those same subjects, Defendants \nhave violated and are violating Dr. Meriwether’s right to equal protection of the law \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \n358. Dr. Meriwether is similarly situated to other professors at the University. \n359. Defendants take no disciplinary action against professors who support and \nendorse the concepts of gender identity, but they take disciplinary action against \nprofessors, like Dr. Meriwether, who refuse to endorse those concepts.  \n360. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  have  also  been  applied  to \ndiscriminate intentionally against Dr. Meriwether’s rights to freedom of speech, right \nto be free from compelled speech, free exercise of religion, right to be free from \nunconstitutional conditions, and right to due process of law. Thus, discriminatory \nintent is presumed.  \n361. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices burden Dr. \nMeriwether’s fundamental rights, target a suspect class (i.e., religion), and have no \nrational basis.  \n362. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  related  practices  are \nunderinclusive, prohibiting some expression while leaving other expression equally \nharmful to the University’s asserted interests unprohibited. \n363. Defendants applied their Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices to \n45 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 46 of 52  PAGEID #: 1502\n \nDr. Meriwether in a discriminatory and unequal manner, granting other professors \nthe right to express their views on issues related to gender identity while denying \nthat right to Dr. Meriwether, in violation of Dr. Meriwether’s right to equal protection \nof the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Plaintiff’s Rights of Conscience and Free Exercise of Religion \n(Ohio Const. Art. I § 7) \n364. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n365. By punishing and threatening to punish Dr. Meriwether for exercising his \nsincerely held religious beliefs according to the dictates of his own conscience in the \nway he discusses issues regarding gender identity both in and out of the classroom, \nDefendants have violated and are violating his right to free exercise of religion under \nthe Article I § 7 of the Ohio Constitution. \n366. The  religious  convictions  Dr.  Meriwether  expressed  and  with  which  he \nsought to live in accordance are sincerely held religious beliefs. \n367. Defendants have infringed on Dr. Meriwether’s right to engage freely in his \nreligious practices by enforcing their Nondiscrimination Policies to force him to \nexpress views on gender identity that conflict with his religious beliefs and that force \nhim to violate his conscience and religious convictions by expressing their preferred \nviews on gender identity.  \n368. Defendants’ Nondiscrimination Policies and related practices do not serve \nany government interests of sufficient magnitude to override Dr. Meriwether’s right \nto live out the dictates of his faith according to his own conscience.  \n369. Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and  their  enforcement  of  those \npolicies violate Dr. Meriwether’s right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed by \nArticle I § 7 of the Ohio Constitution. \n   \n46 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 47 of 52  PAGEID #: 1503\n \nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nBreach of Contract \n370. Plaintiff  repeats  and  realleges  each  of  the  allegations  contained  in \nparagraphs 1–307 of this Complaint. \n371. Under Ohio law, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Shawnee \nEducation Association and the University represents an enforceable contract between \nthe University and Dr. Meriwether. \n372. Throughout his career at the University, Dr. Meriwether had substantially \nperformed  his  duties  under  the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  and  had  not \nmaterially breached that Agreement.  \n373. By subjecting Dr. Meriwether to a formal investigation even though none of \nthe contractual conditions were met and then subjecting him to disciplinary actions \nunder  their  Nondiscrimination  Policies,  Defendants  breached  the  Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \n374. By  subjecting  Dr.  Meriwether  to  disciplinary  action  under  their \nNondiscrimination Policies for expression that is protected by academic freedom (as \ncontractually defined) and the First Amendment, Defendants breached the Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \n375. Defendants  have  no  legal  excuse  for  these  breaches  of  the  Collective \nBargaining Agreement. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  enter  judgment \nagainst Defendants and provide Plaintiff with the following relief: \nA. A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and \nrelated  practices  violate  Dr.  Meriwether’s  rights  under  the  First  and/or \nFourteenth Amendments as applied; \nB. A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  and \nrelated practices, by including “gender identity” as a protected characteristic, \n47 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 48 of 52  PAGEID #: 1504\n \nviolate Dr. Meriwether’s rights under the First and/or Fourteenth Amendment \nfacially; \nC. A preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants, their agents, \nofficials, servants, employees, and any other persons acting on their behalf \nfrom  enforcing  Defendants’  Nondiscrimination  Policies  to  prohibit  Dr. \nMeriwether from expressing his views regarding gender identity or to punish \nhim for expressing those views, including addressing and referring to students \nbased on their biological sex;  \nD. A preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Defendants, their agents, \nofficials, servants, employees, and any other persons acting on their behalf to \npurge Dr. Meriwether’s personnel file of any reference to the punishment they \nimposed on him for expressing his views regarding gender identity, including \nthe June 22, 2018, written warning;  \nE. Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and other costs and disbursements \nin this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \nF.  All other further relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled.   \n48 \n\nCase: 1:18-cv-00753-SJD-KLL Doc #: 34 Filed: 02/05/19 Page: 49 of 52  PAGEID #: 1505\n \nRespectfully submitted this 5th day of February, 2019.7 \n/s/ Travis C.
