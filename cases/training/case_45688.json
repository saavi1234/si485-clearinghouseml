    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit challenges the enforcement of a rule adopted by the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services on May 6, 2024 (the &ldquo;2024 Rule&rdquo;) interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which prohibits sex discrimination in healthcare programs. The 2024 Rule interpreted Section 1557 of ACA&mdash;which borrows Title IX's definition of sex discrimination&mdash;to encompass protections against discrimination based on gender identity and other sex characteristics. The rule was set to go into effect on July 5, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, 2024, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the HHS Secretary, the Director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the 2024 Rule violated the APA and the US Constitution. Specifically, Plaintiffs argued that the Rule's interpretation of &ldquo;on the basis of sex&rdquo; was contrary to the language of the ACA and Title IX and violated the assumption that Congress will not intrude on states' authority to regulate medicine without a clear statutory directive. They also alleged that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. Plaintiffs also argued that the 2024 Rule violated the US Constitution because conditions on federal funds under the Spending Clause must be imposed unambiguously by Congress, which was not the case here. Further, they argued that the Rule violated the nondelegation doctrine by interpreting HHS to have legislative powers that belong to Congress. Finally, Plaintiffs argued that the 2024 Rule was an invalid federal waiver of state sovereign immunity, in violation of the Eleventh Amendment. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, vacatur of the 2024 Rule, and a preliminary and permanent injunction. The case was assigned to Judge Louis Guirola.</p>\r\n<p>On June 13, 2024, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and expedited consideration. The following month, on July 3, the court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the 2024 Rule as it pertained to gender identity discrimination, holding that Plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on their claim that HHS's interpretation violated the meaning of the ACA. According to the court, the substantial cost of compliance with the 2024 Rule weighed in favor of maintaining the pre-Rule status quo. 2024 WL 3283887.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2024, Defendants appealed the court&rsquo;s order granting the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On September 25, 2024, Defendants filed a motion in the district court to stay proceedings while the appeal was pending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of November 23, 2024, the motion to stay proceedings in the district court and the appeal in the Fifth Circuit remain pending.</p>",

Plaintiffs seek to \nenjoin the following defendants from enforcing a final rule issued by the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) on May 6, 2024:  The \nHHS, Xavier Becerra in his official capacity as Secretary of HHS, Melanie Fontes \nRainer in her official capacity as the Director of the Office for Civil Rights, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Chiquita Brooks-LaSure in her \nofficial capacity as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n\nServices.  See Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 89 Fed. Reg. \n37,522 (May 6, 2024) (hereafter referred to as the “May 2024 Rule”).  Plaintiffs also \nseek a stay of the July 5, 2024, effective date of the May 2024 Rule.  The parties \nhave fully briefed the Motion.   \n  After reviewing the submissions of the parties, the record in this matter, and \nthe applicable law, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated they are \nentitled to a stay of the effective date of the May 2024 Rule, and a preliminary \ninjunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or \notherwise acting pursuant to the May 2024 Rule’s challenged provisions. \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  In the absence of Congressional action addressing discrimination on the basis \nof gender identity, the Executive Branch began publishing regulations and policy \nstatements in 2016 that interpreted Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination on the \nbasis of sex to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  As discussed \nin detail below, this lawsuit and the pending Motion challenges HHS’s latest \nregulation, which purportedly implements the prohibition of discrimination set \nforth in Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), 42 \nU.S.C. § 18116(a).  The ACA incorporates the provisions of Title IX in order to \naddress sex discrimination in the healthcare field.  Id.        \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT \n  Plaintiffs include fifteen individual states that allege HHS is “seek[ing] to \nsupplant [their] health regulations with a regime that sides with HHS’s \n-2- \n \n\ncommitment to gender ideology over medical reality.”  (Compl. at 1-2, ECF No. 1).  \nThe Complaint alleges that HHS’s May 2024 Rule would require Plaintiffs to “use \ntaxpayer funds to pay for unproven and costly gender-transition interventions \nthrough Medicaid and state health plans — even for children who may suffer \nirreversible harms.”  (Id. at 2).  Plaintiffs further allege that the May 2024 Rule \nattempts to outlaw policy decisions “excluding insurance coverage for risky and \ncostly gender-transition surgeries . . . .”  (Id. at 6).  Plaintiffs contend that the Rule \n“unlawfully coerces [their] compliance by threatening to strip billions of dollars in \nfederal funding that assists their most vulnerable populations.”  (Id.).  Since \nPlaintiffs “could not have foreseen” that Section 1557 would be implemented in this \nmanner, they “accepted these federal dollars from HHS and built extensive health \nprograms — with annual budgets in the billions — in reliance on that funding.”  \n(Id.).  Plaintiffs also fear that the May 2024 Rule will subject them to lawsuits by \nemployees and patients, “even though neither Congress nor the States intended to \nwaive the States’ sovereign immunity in these areas.”  (Id.).  \n  Plaintiffs maintain that the May 2024 Rule violates: (1) 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \n(C) by unlawfully defining “on the basis of sex”; (2) 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) by \nunlawfully regulating the practice of medicine; (3) 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) because it is \ncontrary to the Spending Clause, Nondelegation Doctrine, and the Eleventh \nAmendment of the United States Constitution; and (4) 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because \nit is arbitrary and capricious.  (Id. at 64-75).  \n-3- \n \n\n  In the present Motion for § 705 Relief and a Preliminary Injunction, Plaintiffs \nseek an order: \na. Declaring the 2024 Rule’s redefinition of sex discrimination likely \nunlawful under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, and the U.S. Constitution; \n \nb. Staying the effective date of the 2024 Rule, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § \n705, as it pertains to the provisions set forth at 42 C.F.R. §§ 438.3, \n438.206, 440.262, 460.98, 460.112; 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.5, 92.6, 92.7, 92.8, \n92.9, 92.10, 92.101, 92.206-211, 92.301, 92.303, 92.304; and any other \nprovision of the 2024 Rule applied with respect to “sex” discrimination \nthat encompasses gender identity; \n \nc. Preliminarily enjoining HHS, and any other agency or employee of \nthe United States, from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or \notherwise acting pursuant to the 2024 Rule’s challenged provisions; \nand \n \nd. Granting any and all other preliminary relief the Court deems \nproper.  \n \n(Mot. at 2, ECF No. 20).     \n  HHS counters that its May 2024 Rule merely clarifies that “sex \ndiscrimination necessarily includes discrimination” in accord with the rationale of \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  (HHS’s Resp. at 1, ECF No. 24). \nIt claims that “most of Plaintiffs’ arguments . . . suffer from the same fatal flaw: \nthey ask this Court to enjoin a Rule that has not yet been applied by the agency.”  \n(Id.).  It further notes that “a covered entity does not violate § 1557 if it has a \nlegitimate nondiscriminatory reason for denying care or coverage to a transgender \nperson.”  (Id.).    \n \n \n-4- \n \n\nIII.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \n  In 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, which provides, “No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis \nadded).1  The statute excepts certain educational institutions, social fraternities and \nsororities, “voluntary youth service organizations,” “Boy or Girl conferences,” \n“father-son or mother-daughter activities at educational institutions,” and institute \nof higher learning scholarship awards in “beauty” pageants from this prohibition of \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.  Id.   \n  Section 1557 of the ACA, which was enacted in 2010, prohibits discrimination \n“on the ground prohibited by title IX . . . under any health program or activity, any \npart of which is receiving Federal financial assistance . . . or under any program or \nactivity that is administered by an Executive Agency . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  \nThe ACA also adopts the “enforcement mechanisms provided for and available \nunder” Title IX “for purposes of violations of this subsection.”  Id.  The Secretary of \nHHS is responsible for enforcing Section 1557 and promulgating regulations to \nimplement it.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(c).   \n \n1 A detailed history and analysis of the enactment of Title IX can be found in \nTennessee v. Cardona, No. CV 2: 24-072-DCR, 2024 WL 3019146, at **1-5 (E.D. Ky. \nJune 17, 2024) (enjoining HHS from enforcing a recent regulation interpreting Title \nIX to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation \nin education). \n-5- \n \n\n  In 2016, HHS issued its first rule providing that the prohibition of sex \ndiscrimination set forth in Section 1557 includes discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity and termination of pregnancy.  See Nondiscrimination in Health \nPrograms and Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,375 (May 18, 2016).  Soon afterwards, the \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a nationwide \npreliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the 2016 rule.  Franciscan All., \nInc. v. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 696 (N.D. Tex. 2016).2  HHS repealed the 2016 \nRule in 2020.  See Nondiscrimination in Health and Health Education Programs or \nActivities, Delegation of Authority, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020).  The United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York stayed the repeal and \npreliminarily enjoined HHS from enforcing the 2020 repeal.  Walker v. Azar, 480 F. \nSupp. 3d 417, 430 (E.D.N.Y. 2020).   \n  On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court held that an employer who fires a \nperson for being homosexual or transgender violates Title VII because, in that \ncircumstance, the termination is “for traits or actions [the employer] would not have \nquestioned in members of a different sex.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 651.  Although the \nBostock Court assumed that the word “sex,” in Title VII referred to the biological \n \n2 The case styled Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Becerra, 7:16cv108-O (N.D. Tex.), had \na lengthy and complicated procedural history due to the agency and executive \nactions that took place during that time.  See Franciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, 47 \nF.4th 368, 372-74 (5th Cir. 2022).  The Fifth Circuit ultimately found that the \nplaintiff’s APA claim was moot and that the district court’s vacatur of the 2016 Rule \nshould remain in effect.  Franciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, 47 F.4th 372-74, 377 (5th \nCir. 2022).  It reasoned that “[p]ermitting important agency rules to flicker in and \nout of existence is detrimental to the rule of law.”  Id. at 375. \n-6- \n \n\ndistinctions between male and female when Title VII was enacted in 1964, it held, \n“For an employer to discriminate against employees for being homosexual or \ntransgender, the employer must intentionally discriminate against individual men \nand women in part because of sex.”  Id. at 655, 662. \n  In January 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order entitled \nPreventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or \nSexual Orientation, Biden Executive Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 07023-25 (Jan. \n25, 2021).  Two months later, the Department of Justice issued guidance instructing \nfederal agencies to apply Bostock to Title IX.  Pamela S. Karlan, Principal Deputy \nAssistant Att’y Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Justice, C.R. Div., Memorandum re: Application \nof Bostock v. Clayton County to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Mar. \n26, 2021).  And in May of that year, HHS published guidance “inform[ing] the public \nthat, consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock and Title IX, \nbeginning May 10, 2021, [HHS] will interpret and enforce section 1557 of the \nAffordable Care Act prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: \nDiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity.”  Notification of Interpretation and Enforcement of Section 1557 of \nthe Affordable Care Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Fed. \nReg. 27,984 (May 25, 2021) (hereafter referred to as “May 2021 Notification”).  HHS \nexplained that “[t]his interpretation will guide the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in \nprocessing complaints and conducting investigations, but [it] does not itself \ndetermine the outcome in any particular case or set of facts.”  Id.   \n-7- \n \n\n  The May 2021 Notification was challenged by Texas doctors who claimed that \nHHS had “misread Bostock and argued that healthcare providers may continue [to \nmake] sex-specific medical decisions relevant to ‘gender identity’ so long as one does \nnot engage in ‘sex’ discrimination when doing so.”  Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d \n668, 673 (N.D. Tex. 2022).  On November 11, 2022, the Neese court held that the \nMay 2021 HHS notification was unlawful and should be set aside.  Id. at 685-87.3  \n  In March 2022, HHS issued a “Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming \nCare” (the “2022 Notice”).  “The 2022 Notice state[d] that attempts to restrict \ngender-reassignment surgeries are dangerous and covered entities restricting an \nindividual’s ability to receive gender-affirming care likely violate Section 1557.”  \nFranciscan All., Inc., 47 F.4th at 373-74 (citations omitted).  The 2022 Notice also \nprovided that HHS “is investigating and, where appropriate, enforcing Section \n1557” in “cases involving discrimination on the basis of . . . gender identity.”  Id.  On \nOctober 1, 2022, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas \nheld that the 2022 Notice was arbitrary and capricious, and it issued a declaratory \njudgment that the 2022 Notice was unlawful.  State of Texas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. \n3d 824 (N.D. Tex. 2022).4  HHS did not appeal the Texas federal court’s decision.     \n  Prior to entry of the decisions in Neese and State of Texas v. EEOC, HHS \n“propose[d] to address nondiscrimination on the basis of sex, including gender \n \n3 The Neese decision is currently on appeal.  See Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d \n668 (N.D. Tex. 2022), appeal docketed, No. 23-10078 (5th Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \n4 The State of Texas v. EEOC case also concerned an EEOC Notice and Guidance \nthat is not relevant to the present Motion.  See 633 F. Supp. 3d at 828. \n-8- \n \n\nidentity and sexual orientation, consistent with Bostock and related case law, as \nwell as subsequent Federal agency interpretations.”  Nondiscrimination in Health \nPrograms and Activities, 87 Fed. Reg. 47,824-01 (Aug. 4, 2022).  After notice and \ncomment, HHS amended and published the rule, which is now the subject of this \nlawsuit. \nIV.  DISCUSSION \n  A.  Standing \n  In order to preserve the separation of powers, Article III of the United States \nConstitution limits judicial power to cases and controversies.  DaimlerChrysler \nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 341-42 (2006); see also U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  \n“For there to be a case or controversy under Article III, the plaintiff must have a \n“personal stake in the case — in other words, standing.”  TransUnion LLC v. \nRamirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In order to \nestablish standing, “a plaintiff must show (i) that he suffered an injury in fact that \nis concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely \ncaused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by \njudicial relief.”  Id. at 423.  In other words, “[i]f the plaintiff does not claim to have \nsuffered an injury that the defendant caused and the court can remedy, there is no \ncase or controversy for the federal court to resolve.”  Id.   \n  As explained in more detail below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that the May 2024 Rule will cause concrete, imminent injury in the \nform of compliance costs.  See Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \n-9- \n \n\nU.S. 367, 382 (2024) (“Government regulations that require or forbid some action by \nthe plaintiff almost invariably satisfy both the injury in fact and causation \nrequirements.”).  This injury will likely be redressed by the injunctive relief sought \nby Plaintiffs since enjoining enforcement of the May 2024 Rule would prevent the \nPlaintiffs from incurring compliance costs.5 \n  B.  Requirements for Imposing a Preliminary Injunction and a § 705 Stay \n \n  In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must demonstrate the \nfollowing four elements: \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial \nthreat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, (3) that the \nthreatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that \nwill result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an \ninjunction will not disserve the public interest. \n \nJanvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d 585, 595 (5th Cir. 2011).  The first two elements “are the \nmost critical.”  Career Colleges & Schs. of Tex. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 98 F. \n4th 220, 233 (5th Cir. 2024).  “And there is authority that likelihood of success on \nthe merits is the most important [element] . . . .”  Id. (citations omitted).  “A \npreliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should not be granted \nunless the party seeking it has clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four \nrequirements.”  Bluefield Water Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Starkville, Miss., 577 F.3d 250, \n253 (5th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). \n \n5 HHS argues that all of the Plaintiffs except the State of Tennessee lack Article III \nstanding to challenge the May 2024 Rule’s amendments to 45 C.F.R. § 92.206.  \nHowever, if at least one plaintiff has standing, the lawsuit may proceed.  Rumsfeld \nv. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52, n.2 (2006). \n-10- \n \n\n  In addition, the APA provides that a district court “may issue all necessary \nand appropriate process to postpone the effective date of any agency action” to the \nextent necessary to prevent irreparable injury.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The parties agree \nthat the same four requirements for imposing a preliminary injunction also apply to \na § 705 stay.       \n    1.    Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \n  When considering plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, courts look to \n“standards provided by the substantive law.”  Jordan v. Fisher, 823 F.3d 805, 809 \n(5th Cir. 2016), as revised (June 27, 2016).  Plaintiffs base their claims on Section \n706 of the APA, which requires courts reviewing agency action to “decide all \nrelevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and \ndetermine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § \n706. \nThe reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction . . . found to be -- \n(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law;  \n(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; [or] \n(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short \nof statutory right . . . .  \n \n5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A-C).   \n  Plaintiffs raise four general challenges to the May 2024 Rule.  Here, it is only \nnecessary to determine whether Plaintiffs have established a substantially \nlikelihood that HHS exceeded its statutory authority when it applied the Bostock \nholding to interpret the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX.  Given that agencies \n-11- \n \n\nare “mere creatures of statute,” this inquiry requires interpretation of the statute’s \nplain meaning, which involves consideration of the statute’s language as well “as \nthe language and design of the statute as a whole.”  Inhance Techs., L.L.C. v. U.S. \nEnv’t Prot. Agency, 96 F.4th 888, 893 (5th Cir. 2024). \n  The Supreme Court recently held that agencies are no longer entitled to \ndeference pursuant to Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. \n837, 839 (1984), because Chevron “allow[ed] agencies to change course even when \nCongress [had] given them no authority to do so.”  Loper Bright Enters. v. \nRaimondo, No. 22-1219, 2024 WL 3208360, at *21 (U.S. June 28, 2024).  Thus, \nChevron “foster[ed] unwarranted instability in the law, leaving those attempting to \nplan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty.”  Id. at *21 (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Now, courts  \nmust exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an \nagency has acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires. \nCareful attention to the judgment of the Executive Branch may help \ninform that inquiry.  And when a particular statute delegates \nauthority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits, courts \nmust respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts \nwithin it.  But courts need not and under the APA may not defer to an \nagency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is \nambiguous. \n \nId. at *22.   \n  The Supreme Court further held that “statutes, no matter how impenetrable, \ndo — in fact, must — have a single, best meaning.  That is the whole point of having \nwritten statutes; ‘every statute’s meaning is fixed at the time of enactment.’”  Id. at \n*16 (quoting Wisc. Cent. Ltd v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 284 (2018)).  For this \n-12- \n \n\nreason, courts must interpret words included in a statute “consistent with their \nordinary meaning . . . at the time Congress enacted the statute.”  Wisc. Cent. Ltd, \n585 U.S. at 284.  Meanwhile, a statute’s scope is determined by examining its “text \nin light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.”  Exxon Mobil Corp. \nv. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 558 (2005).  If an agency’s interpretation of \nits statutory authority “is not the one the court, after applying all relevant \ninterpretive tools, concludes is best . . . it is not permissible.”  Id. at *16.   \n  42 U.S.C. § 18116 (c) grants the Secretary of HHS authority to promulgate \nregulations implementing Section 1557 of the ACA.  The relevant, substantive \nportion of the statute provides:  \nAn individual shall not, on the ground prohibited under . . . title IX of \nthe Education Amendments of 1972, (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), . . . be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any \npart of which is receiving Federal financial assistance, including \ncredits, subsidies, or contracts of insurance, or under any program or \nactivity that is administered by an Executive Agency or any entity \nestablished under this title (or amendments).  \n \n42 U.S.C. § 18116 (a) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs argue that the May 2024 Rule \nexceeds HHS’s statutory authority because “[n]either Section 1557 nor Title IX \nmention ‘gender identity’ as a protected category.”  (Pl.’s Mem. at 11, ECF No. 21).  \n“Instead,” they point out, “Congress expressly limited the statutes’ coverage to \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.”  (Id.) (emphasis in original).   \n  HHS counters that the meaning of the term “sex” is irrelevant because the \nBostock Court held, “[N]othing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome \nof the parties’ debate” over the definition of “sex.”  (HHS’s Resp. at 9, ECF No. 24) \n-13- \n \n\n(quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655).6  Furthermore the preamble to the May 2024 \nRule states that HHS “determined it is not necessary to define ‘sex’ in this rule[.]”  \n89 Fed. Reg. at 37,575.  The Court finds that HHS’s position is not persuasive.  As \nexplained in more detail infra, Bostock’s holding hinged on the broad “but for” \ncausation standard applicable to Title VII, while the present case pertains to a very \ndifferent statutory scheme, Title IX.7  Furthermore, the Bostock Court expressly \nlimited its holding to Title VII claims when it stated, “[N]one of these other [sex \ndiscrimination] laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial \ntesting about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question \ntoday. . . .”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.     \n  Since the word “sex” is not defined in Title IX, courts must interpret the term \naccording to its meaning in or around 1972, when the statute was enacted.  See \nWisc. Cent. Ltd, 585 U.S. at 284.  The day before Title IX was enacted, the Supreme \nCourt stated, “The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a community made \nup exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both.”  Peters v. \nKiff, 407 U.S. 493, 504 n.12 (1972).  Soon after Title IX’s enactment, the Court \n \n6 The Bostock Court explained, “[B]ecause the employees concede the point for \nargument’s sake, we proceed on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the \nemployers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and \nfemale.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655. \n7 The lack of a definition of the term “sex” in the May 2024 Rule results in \nambiguity that undermines many of HHS’s arguments in the case.  For example, it \nargues, “[N]othing in the Rule ‘prohibits a covered entity from operating sex \nseparated programs and facilities.’” (HHS Resp. at 15, ECF No. 24) (quoting 89 Fed. \nReg. 37,593).  The impact of this statement necessarily depends on what HHS \nmeans by “sex,” i.e., whether it includes “gender identity” in the meaning of that \nterm.     \n-14- \n \n\nexpressed its view that “sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable \ncharacteristic determined solely by the accident of birth.”  Frontiero v. Richardson, \n411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973).   \n  After reviewing definitions of “sex” published in dictionaries contemporary \nwith the enactment of Title IX, the Eleventh Circuit determined that “when \nCongress prohibited discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ in education [in Title IX], it \nmeant biological sex, i.e., discrimination between males and females.”  Adams ex rel. \nKasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 812 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc); \nsee also Neese, 640 F. Supp. at 678 n.6 (determining that, when Title IX was \nenacted, “‘sex’ was commonly understood to refer to physiological differences \nbetween men and women — particularly with respect to reproductive functions.”). \n  In Adams, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed assertions that the term “sex” in \nTitle IX is ambiguous because, “[i]f ‘sex’ were ambiguous, it is difficult to fathom \nwhy the drafters of Title IX went through the trouble of providing an express carve-\nout for sex-separated living facilities, as part of the overall statutory scheme.”  Id. at \n813.  For example, those who identify as transgender “would be able to live in both \nliving facilities associated with their biological sex and living facilities associated \nwith their gender identity.”  Id.  Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit explained: \n[R]eading “sex” to include “gender identity” . . . would result in \nsituations where an entity would be prohibited from installing or \nenforcing the otherwise permissible sex-based carve-outs when the \ncarve-outs come into conflict with a transgender person’s gender \nidentity.  Such a reading would thereby establish dual protection \nunder Title IX based on both sex and gender identity when gender \nidentity does not match sex.  That conclusion cannot comport with the \nplain meaning of “sex” at the time of Title IX’s enactment and the \n-15- \n \n\npurpose of Title IX and its implementing regulations, as derived from \ntheir text. \n \nId. at 814.8   \n  While considering Title VII in Bostock, the Supreme Court noted that the \npertinent question “isn’t just what ‘sex’ meant [when the statute was enacted], but \nwhat [the statute] says about it.”  590 U.S. at 656.  It continued: \nMost notably, the statute prohibits employers from taking certain \nactions “because of ” sex.  And, as this Court has previously explained, \nthe ordinary meaning of ‘because of’ is ‘by reason of’ or ‘on account of.’”  \nIn the language of law, this means that Title VII’s “because of ” test \nincorporates the simple and traditional standard of but-for causation.  \nThat form of causation is established whenever a particular outcome \nwould not have happened “but for” the purported cause.  In other \nwords, a but-for test directs us to change one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.  If it does, we have found a but-for cause. \n \nId.  Since events often have multiple but-for causes, the Bostock Court explained, \n“[s]o long as the plaintiff’s sex was one but-for cause of that decision, that is enough \nto trigger the law.”  Id.  This “sweeping standard” led the Court to hold that an \nemployer who fires a person for being homosexual or transgender violates Title VII \nbecause, in that circumstance, the termination is “for traits or actions [the \nemployer] would not have questioned in members of a different sex.”  Id. at 651-52.  \n  However, Bostock’s ruling concerning Title VII does not apply to Title IX \nbecause Congress used different causation language in Title IX (“on the basis of \n \n8 HHS attempts to distinguish Adams by citing the Eleventh Circuit’s analysis of \nthe equal protection claims asserted by the plaintiff in that case, not the plaintiff’s \nTitle IX claims.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 808-09.  The Eleventh Circuit’s discussion of \nthe meaning of “sex” at the time of Title IX’s enactment is persuasive in the present \ncase.  Id. at 812-15.   \n-16- \n \n\nsex”) and Title VII (“because of . . . sex”).  Neese, 640 F. Supp. 3d at 676-78.  In fact, \nthe Bostock Court appeared to be speaking of Title IX when it stated, “The \nemployers [who oppose interpreting discrimination “because of sex” to include \ngender identity and sexual orientation] might be onto something if Title VII only \nensured equal treatment between groups of men and women or if the statute applied \nonly when sex is the sole or primary reason for an employer’s challenged adverse \nemployment action.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 671 (emphasis added). \n  The Court is aware that some Circuit courts have applied Bostock in Title IX \ncases.  For example, the Fourth Circuit has cited Bostock for the proposition that \n“discrimination against a person for being transgender is discrimination ‘on the \nbasis of sex’” in violation of Title IX.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d \n586, 616 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020).  Therefore, the Fourth Circuit \napplied Title VII’s but for causation standard and held: \n[T]he [School] Board could not exclude Grimm from the boys [sic] \nbathrooms without referencing his “biological gender” under the policy, \nwhich it has defined as the sex marker on his birth certificate.  Even if \nthe Board’s primary motivation in implementing or applying the policy \nwas to exclude Grimm because he is transgender, his sex remains a \nbut-for cause for the Board’s actions. \n \nId. at 616.  Meanwhile, the Seventh Circuit has determined that Bostock provides \n“useful guidance” in a Title IX case, calling Title VII and Title IX “closely related \narea[s]” of law, and noting that both Title VII and Title IX “involve sex stereotypes \nand less favorable treatment because of the disfavored person’s sex.”  Metro. Sch. \nDist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th at 769.  The Seventh Circuit expressed doubt that \n“sex” should be “narrowly” interpreted “as something assigned at birth or a function \n-17- \n \n\nof chromosomal make-up.”  Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th at 770.  \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit “‘construe[s] Title IX’s protections consistently with those \nof Title VII’ when considering a Title IX discrimination claim.”  Grabowski v. Ariz. \nBd. of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116 (9th Cir. 2023) (quoting Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th \n103, 114 (9th Cir. 2022)).   \n  However, in the Court’s view, “Title VII . . . is a vastly different statute from \nTitle IX.”  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 175 (2005).  “Title IX \ncondition[s] federal funding on a recipient’s promise not to discriminate, in what \namounts essentially to a contract between the Government and the recipient.  In \ncontrast, Title VII is framed as an outright prohibition [of discrimination].”  Gebser \nv. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 277 (1998).   \n  Since Title IX and Section 1557 of the ACA were enacted pursuant to \nCongress’s authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Cummings v. \nPremier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 218 (2022), the Supreme Court \n“insists that Congress speak with a clear voice” when imposing conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds, “recognizing that there can, of course, be no knowing \nacceptance of the terms of the putative contract if a State is unaware of the \nconditions imposed by the legislation or is unable to ascertain what is expected of \nit.”  See Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 640 (1999) (cleaned up).  \nThis “clarity requirement is a binding constitutional command, imposing a \nconstitutional bar on ambiguous spending conditions and providing grounds for an \ninjunction against the enforcement of such conditions.”  Texas v. Yellen, No. 22-\n-18- \n \n\n10560, 2024 WL 3159081, at *9 (5th Cir. June 25, 2024) (holding that).  Title VII, on \nthe other hand, was enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause, which grants \nCongress “expansive” regulatory power.  See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, \n567 U.S. 519, 549-50 (2012) (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3)).  \n  Neither Title IX nor Section 1557 contain clear statements prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity; they only refer to “sex.”  Since even \nthe Bostock majority agreed that “homosexuality and transgender status are \ndistinct concepts from sex,” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 669, Plaintiffs would have had no \nway of knowing that sex discrimination would be interpreted as including \ntransgender discrimination when they accepted federal funding and developed their \nhealthcare programs.   \n  The Bostock Title VII analysis is also inapplicable because the Fifth Circuit \n“does not unquestionably apply [Title VII case law] to Title IX.”  Neese, 640 F. Supp. \n3d at 677 (citing inter alia Beasley v. St. Tammany Par. Sch. Bd., No. 94-2333, 1997 \nWL 382056, at *3 (E.D. La. July 9, 1997) (“Unlike other circuits, [the Fifth Circuit] \ndoes not blindly apply Title VII standards to the Title IX context.”)).  While HHS \ncites Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), in support of \nits argument that federal courts “have routinely looked to interpretations of Title \nVII to inform Title IX,” (HHS Mem. at 9, ECF No. 24), the Fifth Circuit has held \nthat “Franklin did not establish any sweeping parallel between Title IX and Title \nVII.”  Rosa H. v. San Elizario Indep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 648, 655 (5th Cir. 1997).  \nIn Rosa, the Fifth Circuit explained:  \n-19- \n \n\n[W]e cannot take liberties with statutory language or with the \nreasoning of the Supreme Court.  Franklin’s single citation to [Meritor \nSav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986),] to support the Court’s \nconclusion that sexual harassment is sex discrimination does not by \nitself justify the importation of other aspects of Title VII law into the \nTitle IX context. \n \nId. at 656.   \n  HHS also relies on Carder v. Cont’l Airlines, Inc., a Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act case where the Fifth Circuit mentioned, \n“Based on its legislative history, this court has interpreted Title IX as being \nintended to prohibit a wide spectrum of discrimination against women in the same \nmanner as Title VII.” 636 F.3d 172, 180 (5th Cir. 2011).  However, that reference to \nTitle VII and Title IX is limited to the employment discrimination context.  Id. \n(citing Lakoski v. James, 66 F.3d 751, 757 (5th Cir. 1995) (“Title IX’s proscription of \nsex discrimination, when applied in the employment context, does not differ from \nTitle VII’s.”) (emphasis added); see also Rosa H., 106 F.3d at 656.  As a result, this \nCourt, like the Neese court, fears that it “would risk amending [Title IX and Section \n1557] outside the legislative process reserved for the people’s representatives” if it \nfailed to acknowledge the different language in Title VII and Title IX.  See Neese, \n640 F. Supp. 3d at 679.      \n  Analysis of the language and provisions of Title IX, as well as its regulations, \nprovides even more support for finding that the Bostock holding does not apply to \nTitle IX and Section 1557.  For example, “Title IX presumes sexual dimorphism in \nsection after section, requiring equal treatment for each ‘sex.’”  Neese, 640 F. Supp. \n3d at 680 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (allowing schools in some cases to change \n-20- \n \n\n“from being an institution which admits only students of one sex to being an \ninstitution which admits students of both sexes”); 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(8) (stating if \nfather-son or mother-daughter activities are provided for “one sex,” reasonably \ncomparable activities must be provided for “the other sex”)).  \n  HHS argues that these provisions of Title IX are irrelevant here because \nSection 1557 only incorporates the ground of discrimination prohibited by Title IX \nand its enforcement provisions.  (HHS’s Resp. at 10, ECF No. 24).  However, “[t]he \ncourt’s job is to interpret the words [in statutes] consistent with their ordinary \nmeaning at the time Congress enacted the statutes unless the context in which the \nwords appear suggests some other meaning.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Priv. Fund Managers v. \nSec. & Exch. Comm’n, 103 F.4th 1097, 1110 (5th Cir. 2024).  Therefore, the context \nin which Congress used the term “sex” in Title IX is relevant to this Court’s \ndetermination of what Congress meant by that term at that time.9  Furthermore, it \nwould be unworkable for courts to hold that “on the basis of sex” under Title IX has \na different meaning in the context of Section 1557 regulations than it does in pure \nTitle IX regulations.   \n  For example, Title IX’s regulations explicitly permit, and sometimes even \nrequire, consideration of sex.  These regulations protect (1) sex-education classes \ndesignated by sex, 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(a)(3); (2) comparable, “separate toilet, locker \n \n9 It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether all of Title IX was \nincorporated into Section 1557.  The May 2024 Rule recognizes that Section 1557 \ncites the entire statute, “20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.,” but the Office of Civil Rights views \ninclusion of “et seq.” [as] simply part of an ordinary citation to the title IX statute.”   \n89 Fed. Reg. 37,532.   \n-21- \n \n\nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” id. § 106.33; (3) separate “physical \neducation classes or activities during participation in . . . sports,” id. § 106.34(a)(1); \nand (4) “separate [sports] teams for members of each sex,” id. § 106.41(b).  The \nregulations further require schools to provide “equal athletic opportunity for \nmembers of both sexes,” in “the selection of sports and levels of competition” for \n“both sexes.”  Id. § 106.41(c).  “Thus, while an employer risks Title VII liability \nwhen it makes distinctions among employees based on sex, an education program \nrisks Title IX liability when it fails to distinguish between student athletes based on \nsex.”  Soule v. Conn. Ass’n of Sch., Inc., 90 F.4th 34, 63 (2d Cir. 2023) (Menashi, J. \nconcurring) (emphasis added).    \nIn summary, the Court has found no basis for applying Bostock’s Title VII \nanalysis to Section 1557’s incorporation of Title IX.  HHS acted unreasonably when \nit relied on Bostock’s analysis in order to conflate the phrase “on the basis of sex” \nwith the phrase “on the basis of gender identity.”  Specifically, the Bostock holding \ndid not “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex \ndiscrimination.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.  Interpreting the word “sex” to include \ngender identity would create contradictions and ambiguity within Title IX and its \nregulations.  And it is impossible to determine what Section 1557 meant by “the \nground prohibited under . . . Title IX” without considering what type of \ndiscrimination was prohibited by Title IX.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that HHS exceeded its \nstatutory authority by applying the Bostock holding to Section 1557’s incorporation \n-22- \n \n\nof Title IX in its May 2024 Rule.  “And to the extent that Congress and the \nExecutive Branch may disagree with how the courts have performed [their] job in a \nparticular case, they are of course always free to act by revising the statute.”  See \nLoper Bright, 2024 WL 3208360 at *17. \n    2.    Substantial Threat of Irreparable Harm \n \n  “An irreparable harm is one for which there is no adequate remedy at law.”   \nBook People, Inc. v. Wong, 91 F.4th 318, 340 (5th Cir. 2024).  “If a plaintiff is an \nobject of a regulation ‘there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction \nhas caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will \nredress it.’”  Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 779 F.3d 258, 264 (5th \nCir. 2015) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)).  The Fifth \nCircuit has recognized that “complying with a regulation later held invalid almost \nalways produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs. . . .  Such \nharm, however, must be more than “speculative.”  Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th \n1017, 1034 (5th Cir. 2022).  These compliance costs do not have to be quantified but \nmust only be more than de minimis.  Id. at 1035.   \n  Plaintiffs argue they will suffer irreparable harm in the form of either \nnonrecoverable compliance costs or the loss of federal funds without the Court’s \nimmediate intervention.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 23, ECF No. 21).  For example, Stephen \nSmith, Director of the Division of TennCare, has testified that Tennessee’s Medicaid \nand CHIP programs do not provide coverage for gender-transition surgeries.  (Pls.’ \nMot., Ex. A at 3, ECF No. 20-1).  Therefore, he explains that the May 2024 Rule \n-23- \n \n\nwould cause Tennessee to endure an “administratively burdensome process” that \nwould take approximately nine months to complete in order to avoid losing \n“significant federal funding.”  (Id.).  He concludes that “if Tennessee’s Medicaid and \nCoverKids programs were required to cover sex-transition surgeries, there would be \nan immediate increase in state and federal expenditures.”  (Id. at 4).   \n  Cody Smith testifies on behalf of the State of Mississippi that the Mississippi \nDepartment of Medicaid is barred from providing coverage for gender transition \nprocedures for children under age eighteen.  (Pls.’ Mot., Ex. B at 3, ECF No. 20-2).  \nHe further explains that Mississippi Medicaid and CHIP programs do not cover \n“operative procedures to treat a mental condition” or “cover services that are \ncosmetic in nature.”  (Id. at 3).  He states that Mississippi would be required to \nimmediately expend resources in order to comply with the May 2024 Rule if it \nrequires coverage for treatment of mental conditions, cosmetic procedures, and \ngender transition procedures for minors.  (Id.).  Louisiana, Nebraska, Virginia, \nOhio, South Carolina, Alabama, and South Dakota have submitted similar \ndeclarations describing the harm that the May 2024 Rule will cause them.  (Pls.’ \nMot., Ex. B-J, ECF Nos. 20-2 through 20-10).   \n  HHS argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged imminent harm because they (1) \nface no credible threat of imminent enforcement under the Rule, let alone injury in \nfact, [and] (2) have failed to establish that their purported financial losses are \n-24- \n \n\nimminent and nonspeculative . . . .”  (HHS Resp. at 22, ECF No. 24).10  However, as \nthe Fifth Circuit has explained, Plaintiffs “are entitled to receive clarification from \nthis court before stifling their constitutional practices or otherwise exposing \nthemselves to punishment or enforcement action.”  See Braidwood Mgmt., Inc. v. \nEqual Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, 70 F.4th 914, 927-28 (5th Cir. 2023).   \n  Also, Plaintiffs have submitted testimony that they will incur compliance \ncosts when the May 2024 Rule goes into effect regardless of whether they are \nsubjected to enforcement actions or lose federal funding.  These compliance costs \nprovide sufficient basis for finding a substantial threat of irreparable harm.   \n  HHS further argues: \n[T]he Neese declaratory judgment undermines Plaintiffs’ claims of \nstanding and irreparable harm, because the Rule states that HHS “is \nnot applying the challenged interpretation”— that is, that \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in § 1557 includes discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity —“to members of the Neese class pending \nthe appeal.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,574 n.118.  Thus, because the Neese \nclass includes all healthcare providers subject to § 1557, any potential \nfuture application of the Rule’s interpretation that sex discrimination \nincludes gender identity discrimination to a healthcare provider could \noccur only if the Neese judgment is overturned on appeal.  Any such \npotential future injury is not sufficiently “imminent,” . . . to establish \nstanding or imminent irreparable harm. \n \n(HHS Mem. at 25, ECF No. 24).  HHS’s argument is based on a footnote, which \nprovides: \nIn Neese v. Becerra . . . the U.S. District Court . . . held that [HHS] \nmisapplied Bostock when it issued a public notice, 86 FR 27984 (May \n \n10 HHS also argues that Plaintiffs “lack standing to invoke the purported interests \nof their citizens.”  (Id. at 22).  It is not necessary for the Court to address this \nargument because the Court has found that Plaintiffs themselves have established \nstanding and a substantial threat of irreparable harm.      \n-25- \n \n\n25, 2021), stating that it would interpret section 1557 and title IX’s \nprohibition on sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation and gender identity. . . . The Department is not \napplying the challenged interpretation to members of the Neese class \npending the appeal. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 37,574 n.118.  In Neese, the court certified “a class of all healthcare \nproviders subject to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.”  Neese, 342 F.R.D. \n399, 405 (N.D. Tex. 2022); (see also HHS Resp., Ex. 1, ECF No. 24-1).  The court \nlater entered a judgment declaring: \n(1) Plaintiffs and members of the certified class need not comply with \nthe interpretation of “sex” discrimination adopted by Defendant \nBecerra in his Notification of Interpretation and Enforcement of May \n10, 2021; and  \n(2) Section 1557 of the ACA does not prohibit discrimination on \naccount of sexual orientation and gender identity, and the \ninterpretation of “sex” discrimination that the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States adopted in Bostock v. Clayton County . . . is inapplicable \nto the prohibitions on “sex” discrimination in Title IX of the Education \nAmendments and in Section 1557 of the ACA. \n \n(HHS Resp., Ex. 2, ECF No. 24-2).  The Neese court denied the plaintiffs’ request for \ninjunctive relief.  (Id.).   \n  Even if Plaintiffs are part of the Neese class, neither the Neese Judgment nor \nthe footnote in the May 2024 Rule prevent Plaintiffs from establishing Article III \nstanding or a substantial threat of irreparable harm.  The Neese Judgment was \nspecifically tied to a general notice of policy issued by HHS, while the present \nlawsuit concerns a different final rule, which is much more detailed and extensive \nin scope.  Moreover, neither the Neese Judgment nor the footnote11 explicitly relieve \n \n11 A vague footnote to a response to a comment to a proposed rule surely provides \ncold comfort to those regulated by the May 2024 Rule.  As the Fifth Circuit has \n-26- \n \n\nthese Plaintiffs from compliance with the May 2024 Rule.  As a result, Plaintiffs \nhave no assurance that they will be excused from incurring compliance costs when \nthe May 2024 Rule goes into effect.  Plaintiffs therefore have established a \nsubstantial threat of imminent irreparable harm.      \n    3.    Balance of Equities and Consideration of the Public Interest \n \n  The last two requirements that Plaintiffs must establish are “(3) that the \nthreatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if \nthe injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunction will not disserve \nthe public interest.”  Janvey, 647 F.3d at 595.  “The balance-of-harms and public-\ninterest factors merge when the government opposes an injunction.”  Career \nColleges & Schs. of Tex., 98 F.4th at 254. \n  A stay of the effective date of the May 2024 Rule will not harm either HHS or \nthe public interest because it will merely preserve the status quo.  See Louisiana v. \nBiden, 55 F.4th at 1035.  Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have shown that they would either \nincur substantial costs in order to implement the May 2024 Rule’s requirements or \nlose federal funding.  As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established all \nfour elements for imposing a preliminary injunction and stay. \n   \n \npresumed, administrative agencies, “no less than Congress, do not ‘hide elephants \nin mouseholes.’”  Ryder v. Union Pac. R.R. Co. , 945 F.3d 194, 203 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress, \nwe have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in \nvague terms or ancillary provisions — it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \nmouseholes.”).   \n-27- \n \n\n  C.  The Proper Scope of the Injunction \n    1.  Stayed Regulations \n  The regulations for which Plaintiffs seek a stay are: 42 C.F.R. §§ 438.3, \n438.206, 440.262, 460.98, 460.112; 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.5, 92.6, 92.7, 92.8, 92.9, 92.10, \n92.101, 92.206-211, 92.301, 92.303, 92.304.  After careful review, the Court finds \nthat the July 5, 2024, effective date should be stayed as to each of these regulations \nin so far as these regulations are intended to extend discrimination on the basis of \nsex to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  Defendants are also \nenjoined from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant to \nthe May 2024 Rule’s provisions concerning gender identity.     \n    2.  Whether Relief Should be Restricted to Plaintiffs \n  “Nothing in the text of Section 705, nor of Section 706, suggests that either \npreliminary or ultimate relief under the APA needs to be limited to” the plaintiff.   \nCareer Colleges & Schs. of Tex., 98 F.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024).  “Instead, . . . the \nscope of preliminary relief under Section 705 aligns with the scope of ultimate relief \nunder Section 706, which is not party-restricted and allows a court to ‘set aside’ an \nunlawful agency action.”  Id.  The court explained:  \nThe Department [of Education’s] protests against nationwide relief are \nincoherent in light of its use of the Rule to prescribe uniform federal \nstandards.  When a reviewing court determines that agency \nregulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are \nvacated — not that their application to the individual petitioners is \nproscribed. \n-28- \n \n\nId. at 255.  The Court therefore finds that a nationwide stay of the effective date of \nthe May 2024 Rule should be imposed.12 \n  D.  Necessity of a Bond \n  “The court may issue a preliminary injunction . . . only if the movant gives \nsecurity in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages \nsustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(c).  However, the court “may elect to require no security at all.”  Kaepa, \nInc. v. Achilles Corp., 76 F.3d 624, 628 (5th Cir. 1996).  Due to the strength of \nPlaintiffs’ case as well as the lack of evidence that an injunction will cause HHS to \nsuffer financial harm, the Court finds that Plaintiffs should not be required to post \nsecurity.   \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  A “statute cannot be divorced from the circumstances existing at the time it \nwas passed, and from the evil which Congress sought to correct and prevent.”  \nUnited States v. Champlin Ref. Co., 341 U.S. 290, 297 (1951).  “In all but the most \nunusual situations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.  \n[Courts] therefore avoid interpretations that would attribute different meanings to \nthe same phrase.”  Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v. U.S. ex rel. Hunt, 587 U.S. 262, 268 \n \n12 HHS cites the Fifth Circuit’s refusal to affirm a universal injunction in \nBraidwood Mgmt., Inc. v. Becerra, No. 23-10326, 2024 WL 3079340 (5th Cir. June \n21, 2024).  However, the Braidwood court determined that “there was no basis for a \nuniversal injunction because “there was no basis for the district court to grant relief \nunder the APA.”  Id. at *13.  The Fifth Circuit cited, and did not overrule, its \npublished decision granting a nationwide stay two months earlier in Career Colleges \n& Schs. of Tex.  See id. (citing 98 F.4th at 255).   \n-29- \n \n\n(2019).  Therefore, “it is never our job to rewrite . . . statutory text under the banner \nof speculation about what Congress might have done.”  Garland v. Cargill, No. 22-\n976, 144 S. Ct. 1613, 1626 (2024) (holding that the ATF exceeded its statutory \nauthority when it issued a final rule providing that the word “machinegun” as it is \nused in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b), includes a “bump-stock-type device”). \nConsequently, this Court cannot accept the suggestion that Congress, with a \n“clear voice,” adopted an ambiguous or evolving definition of “sex” when it acted to \npromote educational opportunities for women in 1972.  Title IX and its regulations \nnot only permit, but at times require, consideration of sex as well as separation on \nthe basis of sex.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1686 (“[N]othing contained herein shall be \nconstrued to prohibit . . . separate living facilities for the different sexes.”); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(b),(c) (allowing funding recipients to maintain separate sports teams based \non sex, provided that the recipient offers equal athletic opportunity for members of \nboth sexes).  For all of the reasons noted above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their \nclaims and that they will suffer irreparable harm in the form of either compliance \ncosts or lost federal funding.  The substantial cost of compliance with the 181-page \nrule weighs in favor of maintaining the status quo.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that they are entitled to a nationwide preliminary injunction \nprohibiting Defendants from enforcing HHS’s May 2024 Rule.  Plaintiffs are also \nentitled to a stay of the rule’s July 5, 2024, effective date pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n-30- \n \n\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the [20] Urgent \nand Necessitous Motion for § 705 Relief, a Preliminary Injunction, and Expedited \nRelief filed by Plaintiffs is GRANTED.   \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the July 5, 2024, \neffective date of the final rule entitled Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and \nActivities, 89 Fed. Reg. 37,522 (May 6, 2024) is STAYED nationwide pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. § 705, in so far as this final rule is intended to extend discrimination on the \nbasis of sex to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity in the following \nregulations: 42 C.F.R. §§ 438.3, 438.206, 440.262, 460.98, 460.112; 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.5, \n92.6, 92.7, 92.8, 92.9, 92.10, 92.101, 92.206-211, 92.301, 92.303, 92.304.   \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendants are \nENJOINED nationwide from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise \nacting pursuant to the May 2024 Rule’s provisions concerning gender identity. \n  SO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this the 3rd day of July, 2024. \n Louis Guirola, Jr.\n            s/  \n            LOUIS GUIROLA, JR. \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE   \n-31- \n ",

      "text": "Case 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 50   Filed 10/02/24   Page 1 of 5\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n   \nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.  No. 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR \n   \nXAVIER BECERRA, in his official capacity   \nas Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human \nServices, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO ORDER REQUIRING ADDITIONAL BRIEFING \nDefendants submit this response in accordance with the Court’s order that the parties \n“submit briefs to the Court concerning whether any part of this case can proceed while the appeal \nof the Court’s [30] Preliminary Injunction is pending.”  ECF No. 44 at 2.  Consistent with \nDefendants’ pending motion to stay proceedings, ECF No. 46, Defendants respectfully submit \nthat, in light of Defendants’ pending appeal to the Fifth Circuit of the Court’s preliminary \ninjunction order (“PI Order”), it would be inefficient and potentially wasteful of the Court’s and \nthe parties’ resources to set a briefing schedule on dispositive motions at this procedural juncture. \nBACKGROUND \nOn May 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action challenging the validity of \nportions of a rule (the “2024 Rule”) promulgated by the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”) to implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).  ECF \nNo. 1.  Plaintiffs then moved for a § 705 stay and a preliminary injunction two weeks later, ECF \nNo. 20, and Defendants opposed that motion on the basis that Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed \non the merits or establish irreparable harm, ECF No. 24.  On July 3, 2024, this Court issued an \norder staying nationwide the effective date of specified provisions of the 2024 Rule and enjoining \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 50   Filed 10/02/24   Page 2 of 5\nDefendants “nationwide from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant \nto the [2024 Rule] to the extent that the final rule provides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses \ngender identity.”  ECF No. 30 at 2. \nSince that PI Order, Plaintiffs have moved for a briefing schedule on dispositive motions, \nECF No. 32, which Defendants have opposed, ECF No. 40, and the Court granted Defendants’ \nfirst request for an extension of time to file a response to the Complaint, extending the deadline to \nSeptember 30, 2024.  On August 30, 2024, Defendants appealed this Court’s PI Order to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  ECF No. 42.  And on September 25, 2024, this Court issued an order \nrequiring the parties to “submit briefs to the Court concerning whether any part of this case can \nproceed while the appeal of the Court’s [30] Preliminary Injunction is pending.”  ECF No. 44 at \n2.  Shortly thereafter, Defendants filed their motion to stay district court proceedings pending the \nfinal resolution of Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s PI Order.  ECF No. 46. \nARGUMENT \nIn response to the Court’s order requiring additional briefing from the parties, ECF No. 44, \nDefendants respectfully submit that the Fifth Circuit, along with other circuit courts, has recently \nclarified that “[a]n appeal from a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction does not inherently \ndivest the district court of jurisdiction or otherwise restrain it from taking other steps in the \nlitigation,” Satanic Temple, Inc. v. Texas Health & Hum. Serv. Comm’n, 79 F.4th 512, 514 (5th \nCir. 2023).  See also 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2962 (3d ed.).  That is, Defendants recognize \nthat this Court “ha[s] jurisdiction to proceed on the merits of the case,” “despite the pendent \nappeal.”  Satanic Temple, 79 F. 4th at 514.  Although Defendants’ appeal of the PI Order does not \ndivest this Court of jurisdiction to proceed to the merits, there are nonetheless significant prudential \nas well as judicial and party economy reasons for staying further district court proceedings in this \ncase until the final resolution of Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s PI Order, as articulated herein \nand in Defendants’ pending motion to stay.   \nAt bottom, Plaintiffs’ motion for entry of a briefing schedule for dispositive motions, ECF \nNo. 32, seeks to convert the Court’s PI Order into a final judgment.  Plaintiffs’ motion concedes \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 50   Filed 10/02/24   Page 3 of 5\nas much, noting that “this case is well positioned to move expeditiously toward final judgment,” \nbecause “[t]he legality of the 2024 Rule turns on issues of law that this Court has already \nthoroughly considered and addressed at length.”  Id. at 2.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ efforts to rush to final \njudgment on the very issues briefed at the preliminary injunction stage—that is, before appellate \nreview—are underscored by Plaintiffs’ alternative suggestion that Defendants brief summary \njudgment  and  stipulate  that  “the  administrative  record  is  not  needed  to  resolve  their  legal \narguments, or that this case can proceed with only the filing of a certified list or relevant portions \nof record contents.”  Id. at 3.  On these submissions alone, the Court should not entertain Plaintiffs’ \nrequest to proceed with summary judgment briefing, because, as Defendants explained in their \nmotion to stay district court proceedings, “‘[i]t makes no sense’ for the same parties to litigate \noverlapping if not identical legal issues before this Court and the Fifth Circuit.”  ECF No. 47 at 4 \n(citing United States v. Abbott, 92 F.4th 570, 571 (5th Cir. 2024) (Mem.) (Jones, J., concurring)).  \nThat is particularly true here, where the Court has repeatedly recognized that all of the regulatory \nprovisions Plaintiffs challenged have been stayed or enjoined, see ECF Nos. 30, 44, and Plaintiffs \nhave yet to explain why “expeditious resolution” to final judgment “would promote much-needed \nclarity,” or “provide the States with full relief from the 2024 Rule,” ECF No. 32 at 2.  See also \nECF No. 47 at 3–4 (explaining that Plaintiffs face no hardship or inequity by preserving the status \nquo).  \nIndeed, proceeding to the merits, as Plaintiffs propose, carries the substantial risk of \ninefficient and piecemeal litigation, with potentially conflicting results.  See ECF No. 47 at 4–5.  \nThat is, a Fifth Circuit ruling on Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s PI Order “will have a significant \nimpact on the litigation going forward,” Electronic Order, Walker, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS \n(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020), and could result in potentially conflicting outcomes, should this Court \nnonetheless proceed to the merits while Defendants’ appeal remains pending, see Boyd v. Am. \nHeritage Ins. Co., 282 F. Supp. 2d 502, 503 (S.D. Miss. 2003) (“If this Court follows the reasoning \nin [a case on appeal] and that case is later vacated . . . , then both this Court and the parties will \nhave wasted valuable time and resources.”).  See also Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 50   Filed 10/02/24   Page 4 of 5\n154–55 (1967) (A stay may address economy concerns arising from “a multiplicity of suits” \nchallenging the same regulation.).  Put simply, “[h]ow the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \nanswers the significant legal questions of this case will likely alter upcoming proceedings” before \nthis Court.  Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Case No. A-16-CA-1300-SS, 2017 WL 5649477, \nat *2 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2017).  “Thus, staying this case avoids duplicative and potentially \nunnecessary litigation, conserving judicial resources.”  Id.  See also ECF No. 47 at 4–5. \nFinally, to the extent Plaintiffs intend to change their position and suggest that their \nsummary judgment motion will address only issues not raised in Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction \nmotion—that too should be rejected.  Plaintiffs’ motion for § 705 relief and a preliminary \ninjunction sought preliminary relief on all five claims alleged in their Complaint—nearly all of \nwhich turn, in part, on the fundamental legal question on appeal, i.e., whether Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), applies to Title IX, and by extension, Section 1557 of the ACA.  In \nother words, the same prudential as well as judicial and party economy reasons for staying district \ncourt proceedings until final resolution of Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s PI Order apply with \nequal force to any remaining claims that may not have been resolved by this Court. \nIn sum, although Defendants’ pending appeal of the PI Order does not divest this Court of \njurisdiction to proceed to the merits, Defendants respectfully submit that it would be inefficient \nand counterproductive to do so at this procedural juncture.  The better course is to stay district \ncourt proceedings pending resolution of Defendants’ appeal of the PI Order, which is likely to \nhave a significant, if not dispositive, impact on the litigation going forward. \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 50   Filed 10/02/24   Page 5 of 5\nDated: October 2, 2024    Respectfully submitted, \n \nBRIAN M.

Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 122 (1889).  But a new rule from the \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 2 of 83\nU.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (“HHS”)  seeks  to  supplant  States’  health \nregulations with a regime that sides with HHS’s commitment to gender ideology over medical \nreality.  See Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and \nActivities, 89 Fed. Reg. 37,522 (May 6, 2024) (“2024 Rule”) (Exhibit A).  Purporting to implement \nthe Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination, HHS’s 2024 Rule threatens States \nand healthcare providers with massive penalties for failing to align their policies, coverage \ndecisions, and even medical care with patients’ subjective gender identities rather than sex.  The \nresults of HHS’s 2024 Rule will be radical:  Hospitals and clinics that limit rooms to members of \nthe same sex will be guilty of unlawful discrimination.  So too will a surgeon who performs \nmastectomies to treat breast cancer yet declines to remove healthy breast tissue from a girl who \nidentifies as a boy.  Even a nurse who discusses health problems more prevalent in males risks \nliability if her patient is a male who identifies as a woman.  States, for their part, must use taxpayer \nfunds to pay for unproven and costly gender-transition interventions through Medicaid and state \nhealth plans—even for children, who may suffer irreversible harms.  Courts have twice struck \ndown similar HHS efforts to govern the Nation’s health providers by administrative fiat.  Plaintiffs \nnow ask this Court to enjoin and invalidate the 2024 Rule’s unlawful attempt to do the same.   \nINTRODUCTION \n2.  HHS’s 2024 Rule is the latest effort by the Biden Administration to enshrine \nsweeping gender-identity mandates without congressional consent.   \n3.  When  Congress  adopted  the  Affordable  Care  Act  in  2010,  it  included  a \nnondiscrimination provision known as Section 1557.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18116.  That provision in \nturn  incorporates  other  longstanding  civil  rights  laws  to  protect  patients  from  unlawful \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 3 of 83\ndiscrimination in the healthcare industry.  Relevant here is Section 1557’s incorporation of Title \nIX of the Educational Amendments Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.    \n4.  Congress passed Title IX in 1972 to remedy historic and persistent mistreatment of \nwomen in education.  The relevant portion of the statute prohibits recipients of federal educational \nfunding from engaging in discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  Id. § 1681(a).     \n5.  Federal courts across the country have recognized that the ordinary public meaning \nof “sex” at the time of Title IX’s enactment referred to the biological distinction between male and \nfemale.  E.g., Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 817 (11th Cir. \n2022) (en banc); Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668, 683 (N.D. Tex. 2022); Franciscan All., \nInc. v. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 687-88 (N.D. Tex. 2016) (Franciscan Alliance I); Texas v. \nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 832-33 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  Accordingly, Title IX consistently \ntreats “sex” as binary.  For example, § 1681(a)(2) delays Title IX’s application to an institution in \nthe process of “changing from being an institution which admits only students of one sex” to being \n“an institution which admits students of both sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (emphasis added).  \nOther similar provisions appear throughout the statute. \n6.  Despite this clear meaning of “sex,” the 2024 Rule reinterprets Section 1557 and \nTitle IX to encompass protections for “gender identity” and other “sex characteristics” that appear \nnowhere in the text of either law.  The upshot is a regime requiring providers to engage in—and \nhealth insurers to cover—so-called “gender-affirming care.”   \n7.  To reach this result, HHS relies heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock \nv. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), regarding Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination \n“because of sex.”  But Bostock did not address Section 1557 or Title IX.  Indeed, Bostock expressly \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 4 of 83\ndeclined to “prejudge” any issues pertaining to bathrooms, healthcare, insurance, “or anything else \nof the kind” under any other nondiscrimination law.  Id. at 681. \n8.  This is not the first time HHS has distorted the meaning of Section 1557.  HHS in \n2016 promulgated a similar rule that attempted to expand Section 1557’s protections against sex \ndiscrimination to include “gender identity.”  A federal district court enjoined that attempt, noting \nthat such a reading “conflict[ed] with Title IX, [Section 1557’s] incorporated statute.”  Franciscan \nAll., Inc. v. Azar, 414 F. Supp. 3d 928, 941-45 (N.D. Tex. 2019).  A few years later, a federal \ndistrict court enjoined HHS’s similar 2021 guidance, finding HHS’s conclusion that “denial of … \ncare solely on the basis of a patient’s sex assigned at birth or gender identity likely violates Section \n1557” to be “arbitrary and capricious.”  Texas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824, 838, 847 (N.D. Tex. \n2022).   \n9.  Like HHS’s prior gender-identity mandates, the 2024 Rule represents a radical \naffront to the physician-patient relationship and States’ sovereign interests.   \n10.  Under the guise of “nondiscrimination,” the 2024 Rule seeks to dictate the details \nof providers’ medical practices and facilities as well as impose a new national standard of care for \naddressing gender dysphoria.  Under the 2024 Rule, healthcare professionals must preference \nHHS’s commitment to gender ideology over both the biological reality that the sexes are different \nin ways that affect health risks and their assessment of the proper approach to and scope of medical \ntreatment.  Even inquiring into a person’s medical history and biological sex characteristics could \nbe enough to trigger a discrimination claim and HHS investigation—even though understanding \nthose issues is often critical to assessing and providing appropriate medical care. \n11.  More than that, the 2024 rule will force many doctors to provide controversial and \npotentially harmful medical intervention—like sterilizing hormones and sex-change surgeries—\n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 5 of 83\non adults and children alike.  So long as a doctor provides medication or surgeries to treat certain \nphysical maladies, the doctor cannot refuse to provide HHS’s list of gender-dysphoria-related \ninterventions.  Doing so, in HHS’s view, would be “sex” discrimination—no matter that the \nprocedures are different, that the conditions being treated are different, or whether providing \ninterventions  to  individuals  with  gender  dysphoria  under  those  circumstances  contradicts  a \ndoctor’s reasonable medical judgment. \n12.  By setting out this mandate, the 2024 Rule overrides Plaintiff States’ limitations on \nproviding gender-dysphoria interventions to minors, which the States have permissibly adopted to \nfurther their longstanding and sovereign interests “‘in protecting the integrity and ethics of the \nmedical profession,’ and ‘preserving and promoting the welfare of the child.’”  L.W. ex rel. \nWilliams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 473 (6th Cir. 2023) (citations omitted).   \n13.  Tennessee, for example, has “ban[ned] certain medical treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria,” including “‘surgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into tissues, \ncavities,  or  organs’  and  ‘prescribing,  administering,  or  dispensing  any  puberty  blocker  or \nhormone’” for the purpose of either “enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported \nidentity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or “treating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.” Id. (citations omitted).  Mississippi \nlikewise prohibits the provision of certain “gender transition procedures” for minors, including \n“gender reassignment surger[ies]” and the “prescri[ption] or “administ[ration]” of “puberty-\nblocking drugs [or] … cross-sex hormones.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 41-141-3(d), (f)(1); see id. § 41-\n141-5.  Many other States maintain similar laws.  See infra pp. 37-40.   \n14.  Yet the 2024 Rule would expose healthcare providers—including those employed \nby the States—to enforcement actions, the loss of patients who rely on federal financial assistance, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 6 of 83\nand civil liability simply for complying with state law.  Indeed, at least one Mississippi pediatric \nclinic has already filed a pre-enforcement challenge seeking to shield its medical practice and its \npatients from HHS’s unlawful new gender-identity mandate.  See McComb Children’s Clinic, Ltd. \nv. Becerra, 5:24-cv-48-KS-LGI (S.D. Miss.). \n15.  The 2024 Rule does not stop there.  It goes on to require that States use taxpayer \nfunds to pay for controversial sex-transition procedures under any state-operated plan that receives \nfederal funding.  This includes state Medicaid programs, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, \nand  health  plans  for  state  employees.    In  doing  so,  the  2024  Rule  purports  to  outlaw  as \nimpermissible “sex discrimination” the choice by policymakers in Tennessee, Mississippi, and \nother States to exclude insurance coverage for risky and costly gender-transition surgeries, among \nother things. \n16.  In addition, the 2024 Rule subjects States to private suits by employees and patients \nfor failing to follow these gender-identity mandates, even though neither Congress nor the States \nintended to waive the States’ sovereign immunity in these areas.   \n17.  Worse still, the 2024 Rule unlawfully coerces States’ compliance by threatening to \nstrip billions of dollars in federal funding that assists their most vulnerable populations.  The \nPlaintiff States could not have foreseen that the Affordable Care Act’s nondiscrimination provision \nwould be wielded in such a way when they accepted these federal dollars from HHS and built \nextensive health programs—with annual budgets in the billions—in reliance on that funding. \n18.  With the 2024 Rule set to take effect on July 5, 2024, the Plaintiff States also face \nimminent, unrecoverable compliance expenses and the risk of liability in private suits.  These \ncompliance costs and efforts will be substantial—as the 2024 Rule itself acknowledges. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 7 of 83\n19.  Tennessee and tens of thousands of other commenters opposed HHS’s approach for \nthese and other reasons.  See, e.g., Tenn. Comment Letter (Exhibit B).  Yet in adopting the 2024 \nRule, HHS failed to respond to many commenters’ critiques—let alone with adequate explanations \nor supporting evidence.  But basic administrative law principles make clear that agencies must \noffer well-reasoned decision-making to support their regulations, not dodge important aspects of \nthe problem or draw arbitrary lines for political reasons.  Nor has Congress vested HHS with \nauthority—let alone using clear language—to resolve these highly controversial and localized \nissues. \n20.  Because HHS overreaches in its attempt to expand federal antidiscrimination law \nfar beyond what the statutory text, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), judicial precedent, \nand the U.S. Constitution permit, the 2024 Rule should be vacated and set aside. \n21.  Plaintiffs—the  States  of  Tennessee,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  Georgia,  Indiana, \nKansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Nebraska,  Ohio,  Oklahoma,  South  Carolina,  South  Dakota, \nVirginia, and West Virginia—accordingly bring this suit to seek preliminary and permanent relief.  \nThey ask this Court to stay the 2024 Rule’s effective date and preliminarily enjoin enforcement \npending judicial review.  Plaintiffs further request that the Court ultimately declare unlawful, \nvacate, and set aside the 2024 Rule. \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \n22.  Plaintiff  State  of  Tennessee  is  a  sovereign  State  with  the  authority  and \nresponsibility to protect its public fisc, as well as the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.  \nFrom “time immemorial,” States have regulated the practice of medicine within their borders, \nL.W., 83 F.4th at 475 (quoting Dent, 129 U.S. at 121-24), and Tennessee has the sovereign \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 8 of 83\nauthority to promulgate standards of care for licensed physicians, to determine what medical \nprocedures are reasonable for purposes of Medicaid coverage, and to decide what medical services \nshould be covered by its employee health insurance policies.  Tennessee, through its state-level \nagencies and political subdivisions, oversees and operates “health program[s] and activit[ies]” that \n“receiv[e] Federal financial assistance” subject to Section 1557 and the 2024 Rule.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 18116(a).  That includes Tennessee’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program \n(“CHIP”) programs, which provide health insurance coverage for nearly 1.5 million Tennesseans \nwith the help of a combined $10.3 billion in federal funding.  Tennessee also has medical facilities \nthat provide hormonal treatment for minors for various physical conditions, but not for the purpose \nof “gender transition” or treating gender dysphoria.  Jonathan Skrmetti, the Attorney General and \nReporter of Tennessee, is authorized by statute to try and direct “all civil litigated matters … in \nwhich the state … may be interested.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-6-109(b)(1). \n23.

Plaintiff Commonwealth of Virginia is a sovereign State with the authority and \nresponsibility to protect its public fisc, as well as the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.  \nVirginia has the sovereign authority to promulgate standards of care for licensed physicians, to \ndetermine what medical procedures are reasonable for purposes of Medicaid coverage, and to \ndecide what medical services should be covered by its employee health insurance policies.  \nVirginia, through its state-level agencies and political subdivisions, oversees and operates “health \nprogram[s] and activit[ies]” that “receiv[e] Federal financial assistance” subject to Section 1557 \nand the 2024 Rule.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  That includes Virginia’s Medicaid and CHIP programs, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 12 of 83\nrun by the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, which provide health insurance \ncoverage for approximately 2 million residents with the help of a combined $17.2 billion in federal \nfunding.   \n30.  Plaintiff  State  of  West  Virginia  is  a  sovereign  State  with  the  authority  and \nresponsibility to protect its public fisc, as well as the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.  \nWest Virginia has the sovereign authority to promulgate standards of care for licensed physicians, \nto determine what medical procedures are reasonable for purposes of Medicaid coverage, and to \ndecide what medical services should be covered by its employee health insurance policies.  West \nVirginia, through its state-level agencies and political subdivisions, oversees and operates “health \nprogram[s] and activit[ies]” that “receiv[e] Federal financial assistance” subject to Section 1557 \nand the 2024 Rule.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  That includes West Virginia’s Medicaid and CHIP \n(“WVCHIP”) programs, which provide health insurance coverage for nearly 530,000 residents \nwith the help of roughly $4 billion in federal funding. \n31.  Plaintiff States of Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and \nSouth Dakota are likewise sovereign States with the authority and responsibility to protect their \npublic fisc, as well as the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens.  They also have the sovereign \nauthority to promulgate standards of care for licensed physicians, to determine what medical \nprocedures are reasonable for purposes of Medicaid coverage, and to decide what medical services \nshould be covered by their employee health insurance policies.  Through their state-level agencies \nand political subdivisions, these States oversee and operate “health program[s] and activit[ies]” \nthat “receiv[e] Federal financial assistance” subject to Section 1557 and the 2024 Rule.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 18116(a).  Combined, these States receive many billions of dollars in federal funding from HHS, \nincluding funds to operate their respective Medicaid and CHIP programs. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 13 of 83\nII.  Defendants \n32.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is an executive agency \nof the federal government charged with promulgating regulations under Section 1557 and with \nenforcing Section 1557 and related agency regulations and rules.   \n33.  Defendant Xavier Becerra is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services and is responsible for the agency’s administration, including the effectuation of \nSection 1557 via rulemaking.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(c).  He is sued in his official capacity only. \n34.  Defendant Melanie Fontes Rainer is the Director of the Office for Civil Rights \nwithin HHS and is responsible for bringing enforcement actions under Section 1557.  She is sued \nin her official capacity only. \n35.  Defendant Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is an agency \nwithin  HHS  that  participated  in  the  promulgation  of  the  2024  Rule  and  will  implement \namendments to the CMS regulations. \n36.  Defendant Chiquita Brooks-LaSure is the Administrator of CMS.  She is sued in \nher official capacity only. \n37.  Collectively, Defendants are referred to as “HHS.” \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n38.  This Court has federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the \nPlaintiff States challenge HHS’s actions under the Administrative Procedure Act’s provision for \njudicial review of agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and other federal laws. \n39.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1346 because this case involves \nclaims against agencies and employees of the federal government.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 14 of 83\n40.  An actual controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201(a). \n41.  This Court has the authority to grant Plaintiff States the relief they request under \nthe  APA,  5  U.S.C.  §§ 705-06;  the  Declaratory  Judgment  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §§ 2201-02;  the \nConstitution; and the Court’s inherent equitable powers. \n42.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants are agencies of \nthe United States and officers thereof sued in their official capacities, and Plaintiff State of \nMississippi is a resident of every judicial district and division within its sovereign territory, \nincluding this judicial district and division.  See, e.g., Texas v. Garland, 2023 WL 4851893, at *3 \n(N.D. Tex. July 28, 2023) (noting a “state resides at every point within its boundaries”) (alteration \nomitted) (quoting Atlanta & F.R. Co. v. W. Ry. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1892)). \n43.  The Southern Division of the Southern District of Mississippi is a proper division \nfor this action because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred in this \ndivision, the Mississippi Attorney General maintains a physical office in this division, and no \nDefendant resides in the State of Mississippi. \n44.  The 2024 Rule purposely regulates medical providers and health insurance plans \nacross the country, including those located in the Plaintiff States.  Therefore, this Court has \npersonal jurisdiction over the HHS Secretary, OCR Director, and CMS Administrator for purposes \nof this action because their immunity has been abrogated by 5 U.S.C. § 702, and they have \n“submit[ted]” to such jurisdiction “through contact with and” regulatory “activity directed at” \nPlaintiff States and their respective medical providers and health plans.  J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. \nv. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 881 (2011). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 15 of 83\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The Affordable Care Act’s Prohibition on Sex Discrimination. \n45.  In 2010, Congress approved, and President Obama signed into law, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Pub. L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010).  As relevant \nhere, the ACA prohibits those receiving federal health funding from engaging in discrimination on \nthe basis of several specified characteristics, including sex. \nA.  The ACA’s Incorporation of Title IX. \n46.  Section 1557 of the ACA provides that an “individual shall not, on the ground[s] \nprohibited under” four existing federal civil rights laws—Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.) (race, color, national origin); Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.) (sex); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. § 6101, \net seq.) (age); and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) (disability)—“be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, \nany health program or activity, any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance …, or \nunder  any  program  or  activity  that  is  administered  by  an  Executive  Agency  or  any  entity \nestablished under [the ACA].”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). \n47.  Section 1557 does not create any new bases of prohibited discrimination.  By \nreferencing  Title  IX  and  three  other  well-established  federal  nondiscrimination  provisions, \n“Congress incorporated the legal standards that define discrimination under each one.”  Doe v. \nBlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, Inc., 926 F.3d 235, 239 (6th Cir. 2019).   \n48.  Section 1557 does not reference sexual orientation or gender identity. \n49.  Section 1557’s sole basis for prohibiting sex discrimination is its cross-reference to \n“the ground prohibited under … title IX (20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.).”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 16 of 83\n50.  Title IX states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) \n(emphasis added).   \n51.  “Reputable dictionary definitions of ‘sex’ from the time of Title IX’s enactment [in \n1972] show that when Congress prohibited discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’ … it meant \nbiological sex, i.e., discrimination between males and females.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 812 (collecting \ndefinitions).   \n52.  Title IX’s text and structure confirm its biological-binary understanding of sex.  \nTitle IX expressly states that it does not prohibit covered entities from “maintaining separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes,” i.e., for males and females.  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  And many of \nTitle  IX’s  exclusions  specifically  preserve  male-only  or  female-only  spaces.    See,  e.g.,  id. \n§ 1681(a)(6) (college fraternity and sorority membership practices and sex-segregated voluntary \nservice organizations like the Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Camp Fire Girls); § 1681(a)(7) (boy or \ngirl conferences); § 1681(a)(9) (scholarships for single-sex beauty pageants).  Senator Bayh \nexplained at the time of Title IX’s enactment that “differential treatment by sex” was permissible \nin certain instances, such as “where personal privacy must be preserved.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5807 \n(1972) (Statement of Sen. Bayh). \n53.  Indeed, Title IX consistently treats sex as a binary, using phrases such as “one sex,” \n“the other sex,” and “both sexes.” See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (delaying Title IX’s application to \nan institution in the process of “changing from being an institution which admits only students of \none sex to being an institution which admits students of both sexes”) (emphasis added); id. \n§ 1681(a)(5) (excepting a public undergraduate institution with a historic “policy of admitting only \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 17 of 83\nstudents of one sex”) (emphasis added); id. § 1681(a)(6) (excepting certain organizations whose \nmembership  “has  traditionally  been  limited  to  persons  of  one  sex”)  (emphasis  added);  id. \n§ 1681(a)(8) (excepting from Title IX’s coverage “father-son or mother-daughter activities” so \nlong as similar opportunities provided for “one sex” are provided for “the other sex”) (emphasis \nadded); id. § 1681(a)(9) (excepting scholarships associated with participation in a beauty pageant \n“limited to individuals of one sex only”); id. § 1681(b) (clarifying that Title IX does not require \n“preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one sex”) (emphasis added).   \n54.  This treatment of “sex” as a male-female binary reflects Title IX’s linguistic \ncontext.    “The  phrase  ‘gender  identity’  did  not  exist”  in  1972  “outside  of  some  esoteric \npsychological publications.”  Ryan T. Anderson, Ph.D, & Melody Wood, Gender Identity Policies \nin Schools: What Congress, the Courts, and the Trump Administration Should Do, at 9, The \nHeritage  Found. (2017).  And the word  “gender” had itself “been coined only  recently in \ncontradistinction to sex.”  Id.  Indeed, “psychiatric literature” at the time “conflated sexual \norientation with gender identity.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 3 F.4th \n1299, 1336 (11th Cir. 2021) (Pryor, C.J., dissenting) (citing Jack Drescher, Transsexualism, \nGender Identity Disorder and the DSM, 14 J. Gay & Lesbian Mental Health 109, 111 (2010)), \nrev’d on reh’g on banc, 57 F.4th 791.  “Even the early users of the term ‘gender identity’ \nrecognized the distinction between ‘sex’ and ‘gender identity.’”  Franciscan Alliance I, 227 F. \nSupp. 3d at 688 (noting that the psychoanalyst who coined term “gender identity” believed “sex \nwas biological but gender was social”). \n55.  The original post-enactment regulations implementing Title IX, see C.F.R. pt. 86 \n(1975) (now codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 106), likewise treat sex as binary, referring multiple times to \n“one sex,” especially versus “the other sex”; using the phrase “both sexes”; referencing “boys and \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 18 of 83\ngirls” and “male and female teams”; and preserving certain sex-segregated spaces.  See, e.g., 34 \nC.F.R.  §§  106.33,  106.34(a)(3),  106.36(c),  106.37(a)(3),  106.41,  106.51(a)(4),  106.58(a), \n106.60(b), 106.61. \n56.  In the decades after Title IX’s enactment, the Department of Education consistently \ninterpreted “sex” as a biological-binary classification—male and female—consistent with the \nstatutory text, structure, and purpose and with the statute’s implementing regulations. \n57.  Thus, it is unsurprising that when the ACA was enacted in 2010, “no federal court \nor agency had interpreted Title IX sex discrimination to include gender identity.”  Franciscan \nAlliance I, 227 F. Supp. 3d at 688.   \n58.  Section 1557 specifically excludes from the scope of its nondiscrimination rule \n“transsexualism” and any “gender identity disorder” “not resulting from physical impairments.” \n42 U.S.C. § 18116(a) (prohibiting discrimination “on the ground prohibited under … section 794 \nof title 29”); 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(F)(i) (providing that “transsexualism” and “gender identity \ndisorders not resulting from physical impairments” are not a “disability” under section 794).   \nB.  The ACA’s Application to States and Other HHS Funding Recipients.   \n59.  Section 1557 applies to what HHS calls “covered entities,” including recipients of \nfederal financial assistance programs, such as Medicaid and CHIP.  Covered entities include \nhospitals, clinics, and doctors that accept patients paying for services through these financial \nassistance programs, as well as certain pharmacies and health insurance issuers. \n60.  An entity “any part of which” participates in HHS financial assistance programs is \nsubject in all respects of its health programs and activities to Section 1557.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  \nThat means that any hospital or doctor’s office that accepts a single Medicaid or CHIP patient \nmust follow Section 1557 for all its patients, no matter how other patients pay for care. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 19 of 83\n61.  The ACA incorporates Title IX’s public and private enforcement mechanisms for \nSection 1557 and HHS’s implementing regulations.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). \n62.  If HHS finds a covered entity in noncompliance with Section 1557, the agency may \nrequire the entity to take remedial action or lose its federal funding. \n63.  Section 1557 also allows members of the public to sue covered entities to require \ncompliance and seek damages through a private right of action.  See Cummings v. Premier Rehab \nKeller, PLLC, 596 U.S. 212, 218 (2022). \nC.  The ACA’s Reservation of States’ and Providers’ Authority.     \n64.  The ACA maintains the States’ power to regulate the medical field, as well as \nproviders’ power to practice medicine consistent with their ethical and evidence-based obligations \nto patients.  \n65.  To begin, the ACA sets out a specific “[r]ule of construction regarding health care \nproviders.”  42 U.S.C. § 18122.  That rule specifies that “the development, recognition, or \nimplementation of any guideline or other standard under any Federal health care provision”—\nincluding any provision of the ACA—“shall not be construed to establish the standard of care or \nduty of care owed by a health care provider to a patient in any medical malpractice or medical \nproduct liability action or claim.”  Id. § 18122(1), (2)(A).  Nor, the provision goes on, shall any \nimplementation of the ACA “be construed to preempt any State or common law governing medical \nprofessional … actions or claims.”  Id. § 18122(3). \n66.  The ACA sets further limits on HHS’s ability to promulgate regulations interfering \nwith healthcare entities’ and professionals’ provision of medical care.  Relevant here, a statutory \nsection entitled “[a]ccess to therapies” states that “[n]otwithstanding any other provision” of the \nACA, the agency “shall not promulgate any regulation” that, inter alia: “impede[s] timely access \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 20 of 83\nto health care services”; “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment \noptions between the patient and the provider”; “restricts the ability of health care professionals to \nprovide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions”; or \n“violates the principles of informed consent and the ethical standards of health care professionals.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 18114(2)-(5). \nII.  Background of Gender-Transition Medical Interventions \nA.  Sex, Gender Identity, and Gender Dysphoria.  \n67.  Over the past several years, debates over the clash between sex and gender identity \nhave divided policymakers, medical professionals, and the public.   \n68.  As the Supreme Court has observed, and as Tennessee, Mississippi, and other \nPlaintiff States’ laws set out, sex “is an immutable characteristic.”  Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 \nU.S.  677,  686  (1973)  (plurality  opinion).    It  refers  to  “male  or  female  according  to  their \nreproductive organs and functions assigned by the chromosomal complement.”  Comment of \nEthics & Public Policy Center, at 12, HHS-OS-2022-0012-74097 (“EPPC Comment”) (citing \nInstitute of Medicine, Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter? \n1 (2001), https://doi.org/10.17226/10028)); see, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 1-3-105(c) (defining \n“sex” as “a person’s immutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics existing at \nthe time of birth and evidence of a person’s biological sex”); Miss. Code Ann. § 41-141-3(a) \n(defining “sex” as “the biological indication of male and female in the context of reproductive \npotential or capacity” as determined “at birth, without regard to an individual’s psychological, \nchosen, or subjective experience of gender”); Ala. Code § 26-26-3 (defining “sex” as “[t]he \nbiological state of being male or female, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromosomes, and \nendogenous hormone profiles”); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 77-207(a) (defining “sex” as an “individual’s \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 21 of 83\nbiological sex, either male or female, at birth,” and further defining “male” and “female” based on \ntheir differing biological reproductive systems). \n69.  The “enduring” physical differences between men and women result in different \nhealth risks and conditions that necessitate distinct treatments based on biological reality.  United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).  Indeed, in the medical field, sex is critical.  Women \nhave ovaries, and thus face risks of ovarian cancer, while men do not, so do not; the opposite goes \nfor  testicular  cancer.    See,  e.g.,  Nat’l  Cancer  Institute,  Reproductive  System, \nhttps://perma.cc/A9LT-PZEX.    The  same  reality  applies  to  many  other  sex-related  or  sex-\ncorrelated risks and conditions in areas ranging across mental health, autoimmune diseases, pain \nprocessing, and musculoskeletal health.  See generally Nat’l Inst. of Health, Sex and Gender \nInfluences in Health and Disease, https://perma.cc/92ND-DV5R.  Biology also affects how \npatients’ symptoms present and their proper drug dosage, among many other things.  See id.; I. \nZucker & B. Prendergast, Sex Differences in Pharmacokinetics Predict Adverse Drug Reactions \nin Women, Biology of Sex Differences (2020), https://perma.cc/6XH6-ADX8.  These biological \ndifferences, by definition, mean there are “medical procedures unique to one sex or the other.”  \nL.W., 83 F.4th 460 at 484.   \n70.  In contrast, the term “gender identity” refers to “an individual’s internal sense of \ngender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.”  81 Fed. Reg. \n31,467.  Unlike sex, gender identity is not ascertainable from observing human anatomy or \nchromosomes.    Nor  is  it  an  immutable  or  stable  characteristic.    According  to  the  World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”), a prominent advocacy group that \npromotes so-called “gender-affirming care,” a person’s gender identity instead can “change … \nover time” and encompass “a huge variety of gender identities and expressions.”  WPATH, \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 22 of 83\nStandards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8, 28 Int’l \nJ. of Transgender Health S15, S41 (2022) (“WPATH 8”).   \n71.  The term “transgender” describes people who “identify as a gender” different from \ntheir sex.  87 Fed. Reg. 47,831 n.75. \n72.  Sometimes, persons report experiencing a “persistent sense of discomfort” caused \nby an incongruence between their sex and gender identity.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 467 (citing Am. Psych. \nAss’n, Diagnostic and Statistcal Manual, 261 (3d ed. 1980) (“DSM-3”)).  Initially, the American \nPsychiatric Association referred to this condition as “gender identity disorder.”  Id. \n73.  In  2013,  the  American  Psychological  Association  replaced  the  term  “gender \nidentity disorder” and defined the psychological condition now known as “gender dysphoria” as a \ndiscomforting or distressing discordance between a person’s biological sex and sense of “gender \nidentity.”  Am. Psych. Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 451-53 (5th ed. 2013) (“DSM-5”). \n74.  Not all transgender individuals experience “dysphoria.”  Id. at 451. \n75.  Historically, reported rates of gender dysphoria have been very low.  In 2013, the \nDSM-5 estimated the incidence of gender dysphoria in adults to be between 0.0002% and 0.014%.  \nId. at 454.  However, these numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, particularly in \nadolescent populations.  Recent surveys estimate that between 2-9% of high school students \nidentify as transgender or “gender non-conforming.”  Expert Report of Stephen B. Levine, M.D., \n35 (Feb. 23, 2022), in Attachments to Comments of Alliance Defending Freedom, Factual \nEvidence, HHS-OS-2022-0012-68192.  Consistent with these surveys, gender clinics around the \nworld have seen the number of referrals for gender dysphoria increase rapidly over the last decade.  \nId. at 35-36. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 23 of 83\n76.  Like gender identity, gender dysphoria is not permanent.  In children, gender \ndysphoria typically resolves over the course of puberty, so long as the child is not subjected to \nsocial transitioning.  Levine, supra, at 40-42.  And desistence has increasingly been observed \namong those who first manifest gender dysphoria during or after puberty.  Id. at 42-45.  “Watchful \nwaiting” has thus long served as the “standard approach” for addressing gender dysphoria in \nminors.  Levine, supra, at 17-19. \n77.  Many of the youth who present with gender dysphoria also present with mental \nhealth comorbidities.  Levine, supra, at 13-14, 49. \nB.  Emergence of New “Gender-Transition” Protocols. \n78.  Physicians did not begin offering to minors “what the medical profession has come \nto call gender-affirming care” until the late 1990s.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 467.  \n79.  Influential  medical  interest  groups  have  since  advocated  for  treating  gender \ndysphoria in both adults and children by “affirming” their incongruence with sex through a \nprotocol of social, chemical, and surgical transition designed to align their physical appearance \nand behavior with their internal sense of gender.  Id.  These groups assert that gender-transition \ninterventions,  referred  to  as  “gender-affirming  care,”  are  medically  necessary  for  many \nindividuals—including minors going through puberty—even though these “treatments” can lead \nto infertility and other harmful side effects. \n80.  WPATH now publishes what it describes as “standards of care” for treating people \nwith gender dysphoria in both children and adults.  See WPATH 8, supra; see also WPATH, \nStandards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming \nPeople, Version 7 (2012), HHS-OS-2022-0012-4074 (“WPATH 7”). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 24 of 83\n81.  HHS has previously described WPATH as an “advocacy group.”  85 Fed. Reg. at \n37,198.  So has WPATH itself.  See Boe v. Marshall, No. 2:22-cv-184-LCB, Doc. 208, at 3 (M.D. \nAla. Dec. 27, 2022).  That label makes sense.  Members of WPATH are required to show a \ncommitment to “trans rights” and need not be medical professionals.  Levine, supra, at 26-27.  \nContrary viewpoints “have been known to be shouted down and effectively silenced by the large \nnumber of nonprofessional adults who attend the organization’s biennial meetings.”  Id. at 26.  \nAnd WPATH has ardently opposed efforts to discover the bases for its “standards.” See Boe v. \nMarshall, No. 2:22-cv-184-LCB, Doc. 263, at 1-3 (M.D. Ala. Mar. 27, 2023).  \n82.  Another leading advocate for so-called “gender-affirming care” is the Endocrine \nSociety, which has published recommendations for treating gender dysphoria in minors and adults.  \nThose recommendations advocate for the use of both hormonal and surgical interventions as \nmedically necessary “treatments”—all while the Society’s members stand to financially benefit \nfrom the use of such treatments for gender dysphoria.  Hembree, et al., Endocrine Treatment of \nGender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent  Persons:  An  Endocrine  Society  Clinical  Practice \nGuideline,  10  J.  Clin.  Endocrinol  Metab.  3869-3896  (2017),  HHS-OS-2022-0012-4060 \n(“Endocrine Society Guideline”).  Yet the Endocrine Society “makes no warranty, express or \nimplied, regarding [its] guidelines,” “nor do they establish a standard of care.”  Id. at 3895. \n83.  The gender-transition protocol embraced by these medical interest groups proceeds \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition with mental health treatment; (2) puberty blockers (for \nthose who have not completed puberty); (3) cross-sex hormones—i.e., hormones associated with \nthe physiological development of the opposite sex; and (4) gender-transition surgery.  Jason \nRafferty, et al., Ensuring Comprehensive Care and Support for Transgender and Gender-Diverse \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 25 of 83\nChildren and Adolescents 6-7, 142 Pediatrics 4 (2018); see WPATH 7, supra, at 57; WPATH 8, \nsupra, at S258, App’x E (non-exhaustive list of gender-transition surgeries).   \n84.  Many  of  these  medical  interventions  carry  with  them  irreversible,  lifelong \nconsequences, including sterilization, loss of sexual function, decreased bone density, increased \nrisks of cardiovascular disease and cancer, negative psychological consequences, and a lifelong \ndependence on hormone drugs.  See infra, ¶¶ 87-104. \n85.  The medical guidelines advocated by WPATH and Endocrine Society have become \nmore aggressive over time.  “Today, these guidelines permit the use of puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones from the early stages of pubertal development.  Therapy or time spent living as the \ndesired gender is no longer required before or along with such treatments.  Many surgical \ntreatments initially restricted to adults have become available to minors in the past six years, often \nwithout any prerequisites for therapy or cross-sex hormone treatments.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 467-68 \n(citations omitted). \n86.  WPATH’s latest set of “standards” removes all minimum-age requirements for \ncross-sex hormones and all gender-transition surgeries except for phalloplasty.  WPATH 8, supra, \nat S43-79.  These standards moreover devote an entire chapter to self-identified “eunuchs”—\nindividuals “assigned male at birth” who “wish to eliminate masculine physical features, masculine \ngenitals, or genital functioning”—and the recommendation of “castration to better align their \nbodies with their gender identity.”  Id. at S88-89.  WPATH’s recommendation for the castration \nof “eunuchs” was based on information it learned from a “large online peer-support community” \nwith thousands of stories that “focus on the eroticization of child castration” and “involve the \nsadistic sexual abuse of children.”  Id. at S88; Genevieve Gluck, Top Trans Medical Association \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 26 of 83\nCollaborated  With  Castration,  Child  Abuse  Fetishists,  REDUXX  (May  17,  2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/5DWF-MLRU. \nC.  Risks of Gender-Transition Interventions. \n87.  “[N]o one disputes” that the above-mentioned interventions for gender dysphoria \n“carry risks or that the evidence supporting their use is far from conclusive.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at \n489. \n88.  The FDA may approve the marketing of drugs as safe and effective to treat a certain \ncondition  based  on  “adequate  and  well-controlled  investigations”—typically  a  double-blind, \nrandomized, clinical trial.  21 U.S.C. § 355(d).  But as WPATH 7 acknowledged, “[t]o date, no \ncontrolled clinical trials of any feminizing/masculinizing hormone regimen have been conducted \nto evaluate safety or efficacy in producing physical transition.”  WPATH 7, supra, at 47.  That \nremains true today.   \n89.  Although the FDA has approved puberty blockers to rectify a hormonal imbalance \nin young children caused by precocious puberty, it has not approved their use as treatment for \ngender dysphoria in either children or adults.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 488.  So, too, for cross-sex \nhormones.  Id.  Thus, the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for the purpose of \ntreating gender dysphoria is considered “off label.” \n90.  The known risks of hormonal gender transition are significant and well known.  \nRisks associated with puberty-blocking drugs include “adverse effects on bone mineralization,” \n“compromised fertility if the person subsequently is treated with sex hormones,” and “unknown \neffects on brain development.”  Endocrine Society Guideline, supra, at 3882.  Recently, the FDA \nrequired drug manufacturers to warn that puberty blockers may cause “pseudotumor cerebri, \nincluding headache, papilledema, blurred or loss of vision, diplopia, pain behind the eye or pain \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 27 of 83\nwith eye movement, tinnitus, dizziness and nausea.” FDA, Risk of Pseudotumor Cerebri Added to \nLabeling for Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist (July 1, 2022). \n91.  While some proponents say puberty blockers act merely as a “pause button,” \nresearch shows that is not the case.  Nearly all minors who start puberty blockers progress to \nsterilizing cross-sex hormones, and the majority of those individuals go on to have gender-\ntransition surgery.  Levine, supra, at 48-49 (UK study found 98% of adolescents who used puberty \nblockers progressed to cross-sex hormones); de Vries et al., Puberty suppression in adolescents \nwith gender identity disorder: a prospective follow-up study, 8 J. Sex Med. 8 (2011) (Dutch study \nfound 100% of adolescents who took puberty blockers progressed to cross-sex hormones); de Vries \net al., Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment, \n134 Pediatrics 4 (2014) (follow-up study found most adolescents who received cross-sex hormones \nwent on to have sex-reassignment surgery). \n92.  Conversely,  without  hormonal  intervention,  most  children  exhibiting  gender \ndysphoria come to align their gender identity with their sex by the time they reach adulthood.  \nDesistence is increasingly observed among teens and young adults who first manifest gender \ndysphoria during or after adolescence.  Levine, supra, at 40-45; Paul Hruz, Deficiencies in \nScientific Evidence for Medical Management of Gender Dysphoria 36, 87 The Lineacre Quarterly \n1 (Feb. 2020), in Attachments to Comments of Alliance Defending Freedom, Factual Evidence, \nHHS-OS-2022-0012-68192 (noting most recent studies reported desistence in nearly 85% of \nchildren before the adoption of the “affirming” model). \n93.  Cross-sex hormone interventions also have physical side effects  and increase \nserious health risks.  See L.W., 83 F.4th at 489 (listing side effects and potential health risks in \ndetail). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 28 of 83\n94.  Giving adolescent girls the high doses of testosterone needed for gender transition \ninduces  hyperandrogenism.    According  to  WPATH  8,  this  causes  “clitoral  enlargement” \n(clitoromegaly), “vaginal atrophy” (atrophy of the lining of the vagina and uterus), “deepening of \nthe voice,” facial/body hair growth” (hirsutism), “acne,” and “scalp hair loss.”  WPATH 8, supra, \nat S254, App’x C, Tbl. 1 (cleaned up); see also WPATH 7, supra, at 37 (similar). The Endocrine \nSociety Guideline further advises that induced hyperandrogenism presents a “[v]ery high risk of” \nerythrocytosis, along with an increased risk of severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, \ncerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and breast or uterine cancer.  Endocrine Society Guideline, \nsupra, at 3886-87. \n95.  Giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hyperestrogenemia.  According to \nWPATH 8, this causes “breast growth,” “decrease in muscle mass and strength,” “softening of \nskin/decreased oiliness,” and various forms of sexual dysfunction.  WPATH 8, supra, at S254, \nApp’x C, Tbl. 1.  The Endocrine Society Guideline adds that this condition can also lead to a \n“[v]ery high risk of” thromboembolic disease and increased risk of macroprolactinoma, breast \ncancer, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, cholelithiasis, and hypertriglyceridemia.  \nEndocrine Society Guideline, supra, at 3886.   \n96.  By suppressing sexual development during puberty, a cross-sex hormone regimen \nfor minors will likely cause lifelong sterility. Levine, supra, at 67; WPATH 8, supra, at S254, \nApp’x C, Tbl. 2 (warning of a “clinically significant” risk of infertility).  That is why WPATH and \nthe Endocrine Society recommend warning adolescents seeking gender-change interventions \nabout the “potential loss of fertility and available options to preserve fertility.” WPATH 8, supra, \nat S57, S156–57 (discussing the risk of infertility from hormone interventions); Endocrine Society \nGuideline, supra, at 3871 (similar). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 29 of 83\n97.  The surgical removal of a person’s reproductive organs, referred to as “bottom \nsurgery,” causes irreversible sterility.  As WPATH acknowledges, these types of surgeries also \nlead  to  an  increased  risk  of  infection  and  other  serious  and  potentially  lifelong  medical \ncomplications.  WPATH 7, supra, at 62-64. \n98.  WPATH,  the  Endocrine  Society,  and  other  groups  assert  that  the  significant \nphysical side effects and increased health risks of medicalized gender-transition—including risks \nto fertility—are outweighed by the purported psychological benefits, including suicide prevention.   \n99.  But no reliable studies demonstrate that medical gender transition lowers suicide \nrates, nor is there reliable evidence that medical transition improves long-term mental health \nrelative to other treatments lacking medical risk.  See Levine, supra, at 49-61; Hruz, supra, at 38 \n(citing 30-year study in Sweden that showed patients who had undergone medical gender transition \nhad a completed suicide rate that was nineteen times higher than that of the general population).  \nSome experts believe that this protocol may actually decrease mental wellbeing and increase \nsuicide by, among other things, preventing desistance.  E.g., Levine, supra, at 70-71.   \n100.  As the First and Fifth Circuits have concluded, “the WPATH Standards of Care \nreflect not consensus, but merely one side in a sharply contested medical debate.”  Gibson v. \nCollier, 920 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. 2019); see Kosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 68-96 (1st Cir. \n2014) (en banc).  Recently leaked internal files from WPATH have only further demonstrated that \nthe organization “is neither scientific nor advocating for ethical medical care.”  Environmental \nProgress, The WPATH Files, Pseudoscientific Surgical and Hormonal Experiments on Children, \nAdolescents, and Vulnerable Adults 3 (Mar. 4, 2024), https://perma.cc/4ZCW-FF23.  WPATH-\naffiliated doctors have violated their “ethical requirement to obtain informed consent,” with \n“members admitting that children and adolescents cannot comprehend the lifelong consequences” \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 30 of 83\nof so-called “gender-affirming care.”  Id.  Internal WPATH communications even revealed \ndiscussions  about  surgeons  performing  “non-binary”  surgeries  aimed  at  “creating  bespoke \nanatomical features that do not exist in nature.”  Id. at 37, 51, 64. \n101.  In sum, the evidence supporting gender-transition interventions is weak, at best.  \nHHS concluded as much in 2016 and again in 2020, when it remarked on the lack of “high quality \nevidence” to support the efficacy of gender-transition surgeries and other treatments.  Tamara S. \nJensen, et al., Decision Memo, CAG #00446N, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servs. (Aug. 30, \n2016),  https://perma.cc/R2ME-YQRA;  85  Fed.  Reg.  at  37,187;  see  also  Endocrine  Society \nGuideline, supra (acknowledging that most of its recommendations regarding gender-transition \ninterventions are based on “low quality” or “very low quality” evidence); Levine, supra, at 22-33, \n50-55. \n102.  The evidence of harm from gender-transition interventions, however, is apparent. \nSee Levine, supra, at 56-71; The Cass Review, Independent Review of Gender Identity Services \nfor  Children  and  Young  People:  Interim  Report  47  (Feb.  2022),  HHS-OS-2022-0012-4075 \n(finding no consensus).  Amplifying these concerns are the fact that adolescents often “lack the \ncapacity to consent to such a significant and potentially irreversible treatment.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at \n488.  With increasing frequency, detransitioners have come forward lamenting the harmful effects \nof these medical interventions and their regret for undergoing them.  Id. at 487; Levine, supra, at \n42-45. \n103.  Citing these concerning dynamics, “some of the same European countries that \npioneered these treatments now express caution about them and have pulled back on their use.”  \nL.W., 83 F.4th at 477.  The “public healthcare entities of Sweden, Finland, France, Australia, New \nZealand, and the United Kingdom have raised concerns about the risks associated with puberty \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 31 of 83\nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment and supported greater caution and/or more restrictive \ncriteria in connection with such interventions.”  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1218; see Levine, supra, \nat 31.  To illustrate: \n•  Sweden:  The Swedish National Board of Health has stated that “the risks of hormonal \ninterventions for gender dysphoric youth outweigh potential benefits.”  Summary of \nKey  Recommendations  from  the  Swedish  National  Board  of  Health  and  Welfare \n(Socialstyrelsen/NBHW),  Society  for  Evidence-Based  Gender  Medicine  (Feb.  27, \n2022), HHS-OS-2022-0012-10295, https://perma.cc/NWB6-3XEU.   \n•  Finland:  Finland’s Council for Choices in Health Care has concluded that gender-\ntransition  interventions  in  minors  are  “an  experimental  practice”  and  that  “no \nirreversible  treatment  should  be  initiated”  before  adulthood.    Medical  Treatment \nMethods  for  Dysphoria  Related  to  Gender  Variance  in  Minors  (2020), \nhttps://perma.cc/PX74-4LBK.  \n•  The United Kingdom:  The United Kingdom has similarly restricted puberty blockers \nafter finding the evidence inadequate to conclude that they are safe and effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  B.P.J. by Jackson v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., 98 F.4th 542, \n570 n.7 (4th Cir. 2024) (Agee, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \n104.  In July 2023, a group of respected clinicians from Finland, the UK, Sweden, \nNorway, Belgium, France, Switzerland, South Africa, and the United States published a letter in \nthe Wall Street Journal reiterating that every systematic review to date “has found the evidence \nfor mental-health benefits of hormonal interventions for minors to be of low or very low quality” \nand  that  there  is  “no  reliable  evidence  to  suggest  that  hormonal  transition  is  an  effective \nsuicide-prevention  measure.”    Kaltiala,  et  al.,  Youth  Gender  Transition  Is  Pushed  Without \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 32 of 83\nEvidence, Wall St. J. (July 14, 2023), https://perma.cc/P9GM-MHF7.  Noting that “the risks are \nsignificant” and highlighting the growing international consensus that psychotherapy should be \nthe “first line of treatment for gender-dysphoric youth,” they urged American medical societies \n“to align their recommendations with the best available evidence—rather than exaggerating the \nbenefits and minimizing the risks.”  Id. \nD.  States’ Regulation of Gender-Transition Interventions. \n105.  Tracking the developing international consensus, more than twenty States have \nrestricted access to gender-transition treatments for children.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 471 (collecting \nstate statutes restricting the provision of gender-transition procedures for minors).  Many States \nalso have adopted limitations on the coverage of gender-transition interventions by their Medicaid \nand CHIP programs, as well as their state health plans.   \n1.  Tennessee \n106.  In  September  2022,  the  Tennessee  public  learned  that  Vanderbilt  University \nMedical  Center  was  engaged  in  a  widespread  and  profit-motivated  practice  of  prescribing \nhormones and conducting surgeries on children for the purpose of treating gender dysphoria.  See \nKruesi, Social media posts spark calls to investigate Tenn.’s VUMC, AP News (Sept. 21, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/K3DN-AV4Z.    Vanderbilt  was  performing  “top  surgery”  (i.e.,  double \nmastectomy)  on  gender  dysphoric  minors  as  young  as  16.    The  founder  of  Vanderbilt’s \nTransgender  Health  Clinic  boasted  that  such  surgeries  would  “make  a  lot  of  money”  for \nVanderbilt,  as  would  “routine  hormone  treatment.”    Amanda  Prestigiacomo,  ‘Huge  Money \nMaker’:  Video  Reveals  Vanderbilt’s  Shocking  Gender  ‘Care,’  Threats  Against  Dissenting \nDoctors, The Daily Wire (Sept. 20, 2022), https://perma.cc/M8YH-DLM3.  Vanderbilt was giving \nhormone drugs to “children as young as 13.”  Id. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 33 of 83\n107.  In response, and in an effort to “protect the health and welfare of minors” from \nunproven and risky gender-transition medical interventions, Tennessee legislators passed and \nGovernor Lee signed SB1.  See S.B.1, 113th Gen. Assem. (2023), codified at Tenn. Code Ann. \n§ 68-33-101, et seq.   \n108.  This law prohibits certain medical procedures on a minor “for the purpose of” either \n(1) “[e]nabling [the] minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the \nminor’s sex” or (2) “[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the \nminor’s sex and asserted identity.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-103(a)(1).  Prohibited procedures \ninclude surgery and the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.  Id. § 68-33-102(5).   \n109.  In adopting these restrictions, the General Assembly noted that the prohibited \nprocedures can lead to “life-altering consequences” for minors, including “becoming irreversibly \nsterile, having increased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse and sometimes fatal \npsychological consequences.”  Id. § 68-33-101(b).  It also determined that the harms of these \ntreatments “are not yet fully known” and, in any case, outweigh any potential near-term benefits \nbecause they “are experimental in nature and not supported by high-quality, long-term medical \nstudies.”  Id.    And it found that “minors lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate the \nlife-altering consequences of such procedures.”  Id. § 68-33-101(h). \n110.  Tennessee also limits access to gender-transition interventions through the State’s \nMedicaid program, which is the “primary federal program” though which States “provide medical \ncare to indigents at public expense.”  Mem’l Hosp. v. Maricopa Cnty., 415 U.S. 250, 262 n.19 \n(1974); see 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1, 1396a.  State Medicaid programs are administered jointly by the \nStates and the federal government through a “contract[ual]” relationship.  NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 577 (2012). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 34 of 83\n111.  Tennessee’s Medicaid program is administered by the Division of TennCare.  Like \nall other insurance plans, TennCare expressly excludes coverage for dozens of categories of \nmedical services, products, and supplies—even when considered medically necessary.  Tenn. \nComp. R. & Regs. 1200-13-13-.10(3).  Among other things, TennCare does not cover treatments \nfor infertility, sexual dysfunction, certain organ and tissue transplants, dental services, and certain \npharmaceuticals.  Id. \n112.  TennCare also does not cover “sex change or transformation surgery.”  Id. 1200-\n13-13-.10(3)(b)(72), -(86).  And subject to exceptions for procedures that address defects caused \nby injury, physical disease, or a congenital condition, TennCare also excludes coverage for \n“cosmetic surgery or surgical procedures [performed] primarily for the purpose of changing the \nappearance of any part of the body to improve appearance or self-esteem.”  Id. 1200-13-13-\n.10(b)(22). \n113.  Tennessee’s  CHIP  program,  referred  to  as  “CoverKids,”  maintains  the  same \nexclusions as TennCare.  See id. 1200-13-21-.06(1). \n114.  Tennessee  also  provides  healthcare  benefits  to  thousands  of  State  employees \nthrough its state health plan (“State Plan”).  The statutorily created State Insurance Committee \ndetermines the Plan’s premiums, benefits package, funding method, and eligibility provisions.  \nTenn. Code Ann. § 8-27-202.  The State Plan is funded, in part, through contributions made by \nstate-agency employers on behalf of their employees using federal funding received from HHS.  \nFor example, the Division of TennCare annually contributes approximately $11.6 million to the \nState Plan on behalf of its employees, including approximately $7.3 million in HHS funds. \n115.  The State Plan excludes over 50 categories of medical and mental health/substance \nabuse services from coverage, as well as coverage for dental expenses, on-the-job injuries, and \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 35 of 83\nnon-behavioral mental health/substance abuse expenses.  See State Plan Document § 12.04 (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/F3BB-2RHR. \n116.  The State Plan has long excluded coverage for “[s]urgery or treatment for, or related \nto,  sex  transformations  …  other  than  psychological  treatment  or  counseling.”    Id.  at \n§ 12.04(A)(28).  It also generally excludes “[c]harges incurred in connection with cosmetic surgery \ndirected toward preserving or improving a patient’s appearance.”  Id. at § 12.04(A)(16). \n2.  Mississippi \n117.  In 2023, Mississippi legislators passed, and Governor Reeves signed, the Regulate \nExperimental Adolescent Procedures Act.  See H.B.1125, 2023 Reg. Sess., codified, in part, at \nMiss. Code Ann. § 41-141-1, et seq.  \n118.  The law prohibits certain medical procedures on a minor “for the purpose of \nassisting [that] individual with a gender transition,” defined as “the process in which a person goes \nfrom identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her sex to identifying with \nand living as a gender different from his or her sex” in certain circumstances.  Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 41-141-3(d)-(f); id. § 41-141-5.  Prohibited procedures include certain surgeries and the use of \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.  Id. § 41-141-3(d), (f)(1); id. § 41-141-5. \n119.  Mississippi also limits access to gender-transition interventions through the State’s \nMedicaid and CHIP programs. \n120.  Mississippi’s Medicaid and CHIP programs are administered through the State’s \nDivision of Medicaid within the Office of the Governor. Like all other insurance plans, these \nprograms  expressly  exclude  certain  coverage  for  dozens  of  categories  of  medical  services, \nproducts, and supplies—even when those services are considered medically necessary.  See 23 \nMiss. Admin. Code Pt. 200, R 5.1(C).  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 36 of 83\n121.  Mississippi’s Medicaid and CHIP programs do not cover any “operative procedure, \nor any portion of a procedure, performed primarily to improve physical appearance and/or treat a \nmental condition through change in bodily form.”  Id. at Pt. 200, R. 2.2(A)(7). Mississippi’s \nMedicaid  and  CHIP  programs  also  exclude  coverage  if  the  service  is  “experimental, \ninvestigational, or cosmetic in nature.” Id. at Pt. 200. R. 5.1(B)(7). \n122.  In addition, the Division of Medicaid is prohibited by statute from “reimburs[ing] \nor provid[ing] coverage” for certain “gender transition procedures” for minors. Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 43-13-117.7; see id. §§ 41-141-3 (definitions), 41-141-7 (prohibition on use of “[p]ublic funds” \nand other resources for provision of certain “gender transition procedures” for minors). \n123.  Mississippi also provides healthcare benefits to thousands of State employees \nthrough its state health plan (“Mississippi State Plan”).  The State School and Employees Health \nInsurance Management Board determines the Plan’s premiums, benefits package, funding, and \neligibility provisions. Id. §§ 25-15-5, 25-15-303. \n124.  The Mississippi State Plan limits or excludes coverage for dozens of categories of \nmedical, dental, and other services and expenses.  See Mississippi’s State and School Employees’ \nLife and Health Insurance Plan, Plan Document, at 33-38 (Rev. Jan. 2024), https://bit.ly/3X0oPQz. \n125.  The Mississippi State Plan excludes coverage for “[s]ex transformations” and \n“[p]uberty-blocking drugs.”  Id. at 36.  It also generally excludes coverage for “cosmetic services,” \nsubject to narrow exceptions.  Id. at 33; see also Miss. Code Ann. § 83-9-36.1 (excluding coverage \nfor certain “gender transition procedures” for minors from coverage in Mississippi health-benefit \nplans). \n \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 37 of 83\n3.  Other Plaintiff States \n126.  Alabama law prohibits providers from performing certain gender-dysphoria-related \nmedical procedures on minors.  See Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, \nAct 2022-289, codified at Ala. Code § 26-26-4; Eknes-Tucker v. Gov. of Ala., 80 F.4th 1205 (11th \nCir. 2023) (reversing preliminary injunction of law). Prohibited procedures include castration, \nvasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy, as well surgeries that \nartificially construct tissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs from the individual’s sex, \nthe removal of any healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue, except for a male circumcision, \nand the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.  Ala. Code § 26-26-4.  Moreover, \nAlabama Medicaid does not provide coverage for (i) sex-change surgeries or (ii) cross-sex \nhormones prescribed as transitioning treatments.   \n127.  Georgia law prohibits providers from performing certain gender-transition medical \ninterventions  on  minors,  including  “(1)  sex  reassignment  surgeries,  or  any  other  surgical \nprocedures,  that  are  performed  for  the  purpose  of  altering  primary  or  secondary  sexual \ncharacteristics; and (2) hormone replacement therapies.”  Ga. Code Ann. § 43-34-15. \n128.  Indiana  law  prohibits  providers  from  knowingly  performing  certain  “gender \ntransition procedures” for minors.  See Ind. Code § 25-1-22-13(a).   Prohibited procedures include: \na.  Genital Gender Reassignment Surgery, which includes but is not limited \nto:  (1)  penectomy,  orchiectomy,  vaginoplasty,  clitoroplasty,  or \nvulvoplasty  for  male  sex  patients,  (2)  hysterectomy,  ovariectomy, \nphalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, or implantation of erection or \ntesticular prostheses for female patients, and (3) urethral reconstruction \nwith or without a metoidioplasty, and for a female patient.

Id. § 25-1-22-8.  \n \nc.  Hormone Therapy, which includes any use of testosterone, estrogen, or \nprogesterone given to an individual greater than would be produced \nendogenously by a healthy individual of that individual’s age and sex. \nId. § 25-1-22-4.  \n \nd.  Puberty  Blocking  Drugs,  which  includes  but  is  not  limited  to: \ngonadotropin releasing hormone analogues and synthetic antiandrogen \ndrugs used to block the androgen receptors.  Id. § 25-1-22-11. \n \n129.  Kansas’  Medicaid  and  CHIPS  programs  are  administered  by  the  Kansas \nDepartment of Health and Environment (“KDHE”) and the Kansas Department of Aging and \nDisability Services (“KDADS”).  Kansas contracts with three managed-care providers (“MCOs”) \nto provide healthcare plans to qualifying individuals: United, Sunflower, and Aetna.  These MCOs \nprovide medically necessary care to enrolled individuals, as described and covered by their \nrespective healthcare plans.  None of the MCOs that administer healthcare benefits under KanCare \ncovers  gender-transition  surgeries.    See  United  Healthcare  Handbook  (2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/X36H-U64B; Sunflower Health Plan Handbook (2024), https://perma.cc/8CX5-\nVF39;  Aetna  Better  Health  Handbook  (2024),  https://perma.cc/C6V9-2ME7.    Additionally, \nKansas state agencies, including KDHE and KDADS, which operate KanCare, must identify \nindividuals by biological sex whenever they collect data on individuals “for the purpose of \ncomplying with anti-discrimination laws or for the purpose of gathering accurate public health, \ncrime, economic or other data.”  Kan. Stat. Ann. § 77-207(c). \n130.  Kentucky law prohibits health care providers from performing certain gender-\ndysphoria-related medical procedures on minors.  See Ky. Rev. Stat. § 311.372.  Prohibited \nprocedures include any surgery that would sterilize or artificially construct tissue having the \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 39 of 83\nappearance of genitalia differing from the minor’s sex, and the prescription or administration of \ndrugs to delay or prevent normal puberty or to produce hormones in amounts greater than would \nbe produced normally in a healthy minor of the same age and sex.  Id. § 311.372(2). \n131.  Louisiana  law  prohibits  providers  from  performing  or  administering  certain \nmedical interventions “that attempt to alter a minor’s appearance in an attempt to validate a minor’s \nperception of the minor’s sex, if the minor’s perception is inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”  La. \nStat. Ann. § 40:1098.2(A).  That includes the prescription or administration of puberty-blocking \ndrugs and cross-sex hormones, and the performance of gender-transition surgeries.  Id. \n132.  Nebraska  law  generally  prohibits  (with  narrow  exception)  providers  from \nperforming certain gender-altering medical procedures on minors.  See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 71-7304, \n-7305.  Prohibited procedures include surgery and the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones.  Id. § 71-7303(6)(a).  Nebraska law further prohibits the use of State funds, directly or \nindirectly, for providing gender-altering procedures to minors.  See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 71-7306.  \nAdditionally, Nebraska’s Medicaid program excludes sex change procedures from coverage.  See \n471 Neb. Admin. Code § 18-006.01. \n133.  Ohio law prohibits providers from performing certain gender-transition medical \nservices  for  minors.    Ohio  Rev.  Code  §  3129.02.    Prohibited  services  include  “gender \nreassignment” surgery and, subject to exceptions, prescribing cross-sex hormones and puberty-\nblocking  drugs.    Id.    Additionally,  Ohio’s  Medicaid  program  does  not  cover  “gender \ntransformation” medical services.  Ohio Admin. Code Rule 5160-2-03(A)(2)(e); see also Ohio \nRev. Code § 3129.06. \n134.  Oklahoma law prohibits healthcare professionals from providing “gender transition \nprocedures” to any person under the age of 18.  See Okla Stat. tit. 63, § 2607.1(B).  That includes \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 40 of 83\n(1) “surgical procedures that alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features that \nare  typical  for  the  individual’s  biological  sex,”  and  (2)  “puberty-blocking  drugs,  cross-sex \nhormones, or other drugs to suppress or delay normal puberty or to promote the development of \nfeminizing  or  masculinizing  features  consistent  with  the  opposite  biological  sex.”    Id.  § \n2607.1(A)(2)(a). \n135.  South Carolina law prohibits healthcare professionals from providing “gender \ntransition  procedures,”  including  puberty-blocking  drugs,  cross-sex  hormones,  and  gender-\ntransition surgeries, to any person under the age of 18.  See Help Not Harm Bill, H.B. 4624, 125th \nLeg. Sess. (S.C. 2024), codified at S.C. Code Ann. § 44-42-310, et seq.  The law further prohibits \nthe use of public funds for any such gender-transition procedures, and it expressly precludes the \nSouth Carolina Medicaid Program from reimbursing or providing coverage for the same.  Id. \n136.  South Dakota law likewise prohibits healthcare professionals from performing or \nprescribing certain gender-transition medical interventions for minors. See S.D. Codified Laws § \n34-24-34.  Prohibited services include puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, and gender-\ntransition surgeries.  Id. \nIII.  HHS’s Prior Failed Attempts to Use Section 1557 to Further Gender Ideology. \n137.  Since Congress enacted the ACA, HHS has twice tried and failed to use Section \n1557’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination as a mandate to provide and pay for gender-\ntransition medical interventions.   \nA.  The Obama Administration’s Vacated 2016 Rule.   \n138.  Well into President Obama’s first term, federal regulators heeded the historical \nunderstanding of Title IX as limited to sex-based discrimination.  In a 2010 “Dear Colleague \nLetter” on bullying, the Obama Department of Education acknowledged that Title IX did not cover \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 41 of 83\nclaims of sex discrimination by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students based on their \n“LGBT status” alone.  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. Rts., Dear Colleague Letter on Bullying, \nat 8 (Oct. 26, 2010) (marked “not for reliance”), https://perma.cc/3AGM-SB8P.  Instead, the letter \nadvised,  any  claims  must  overlap  with  allegations  of  “sexual  harassment  or  gender-based \nharassment.” Id. \n139.  Yet, a few years later, things began to shift.  In 2014, the Department of Education \nperformed an about-face by asserting that “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to \nclaims of discrimination” based solely on “gender identity.” U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civ. \nRts., Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence, at 5 (Apr. 29, 2014) (rescinded in \n2017), https://perma.cc/Y7BD-XHFU.   \n140.  In 2016, HHS followed suit with a rule that dramatically altered the agency’s \nunderstanding of the scope of sex discrimination under Section 1557.  Dep’t of Health & Hum. \nServs., Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,375 (May 18, 2016) \n(“2016 Rule”).  In particular, HHS defined Section 1557’s prohibition of discrimination “on the \nbasis of sex” to include discriminating against an individual “on the basis of … gender identity.”  \nId. 31,467.  The 2016 Rule defined “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of gender, \nwhich may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be \ndifferent from  an individual’s sex assigned at  birth.”  Id.  And HHS defined  “transgender \nindividual” as “an individual whose gender identity is different from the sex assigned to that person \nat birth.”  Id.  \n141.  The  2016  Rule  required  covered  entities—including  “almost  all  licensed \nphysicians”—to perform or refer patients for sex-transition procedures.  See 81 Fed. Reg. 31,445.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 42 of 83\nAnd it prohibited insurers from maintaining “explicit, categorical (or automatic) exclusion[s] or \nlimitation[s] of coverage for all health services related to gender transition.”  Id. at 31,429. \n142.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas preliminarily enjoined \nand later vacated HHS’s rule insofar as it purported to prohibit “discrimination on the basis of \ngender identity.”  Franciscan Alliance I, 227 F. Supp. 3d at 696.   The court concluded that “HHS’s \nexpanded definition of sex discrimination” that included gender identity “exceed[ed] the grounds \nincorporated by Section 1557” because “the meaning of sex in Title IX unambiguously refers to \n‘the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their \nbirth.’”  Id. at 687, 689 (citation omitted); accord Franciscan All., Inc. v. Azar, 414 F. Supp. 3d \n928, 941-45 (N.D. Tex. 2019).        \n143.  The vacatur of the 2016 Rule remains “in effect.” Franciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, \n47 F.4th 368, 377 (5th Cir. 2022). \nB.  The Biden Administration’s Vacated 2022 Guidance.   \n144.  During President Trump’s Administration, HHS issued a rule rescinding the failed \n2016 Rule and returning the agency’s interpretation of sex-based discrimination under Section \n1557 to the plain, longstanding interpretation of Title IX.  See Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \nNondiscrimination  in  Health  and  Health  Education  Programs  or  Activities,  Delegation  of \nAuthority, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,160 (June 19, 2020) (“2020 Rule”).  In so doing, the 2020 Rule \nspecified that “the term ‘on the basis of … sex’ in Section 1557 does not encompass discrimination \non the basis of gender identity.”  85 Fed. Reg. 37,191.   \n145.  Upon taking office, however, President Biden announced his administration’s \ncontrary  view  that  all  laws  prohibiting  sex  discrimination—including  Title  IX—would \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 43 of 83\npresumptively prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.  See \nExec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021). \n146.  As the basis for this view, President Biden’s Executive Order and various agency \npronouncements cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock.  In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination “because of sex” prevents an employer from \nfiring an employee simply “for being homosexual or transgender.”  Id. at 651-52.  The Court \nexplained that an employer who fires a male employee “for no reason other than the fact he is \nattracted to men … discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female \ncolleague,” and vice versa.  Id. at 660.   \n147.  The Bostock Court, though, “proceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’ …  refer[s] \nonly to biological distinctions between male and female.”  Id. at 655.  It also expressly declined to \n“prejudge” whether its decision would “sweep beyond Title VII” to other nondiscrimination laws, \nsuch as Title IX, or affect policies and conduct—like access to bathrooms—other than the \ntermination of employees simply for being homosexual or transgender.  Id. at 681.  Post-Bostock \nguidance issued by the Department of Education’s Office of the General Counsel emphasized that \nBostock did not affect the longstanding meaning of Title IX’s reference to “sex.”  See Reed D. \nRubinstein, Memo. for Kimberly M. Richey, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office for Civil \nRights,  re:  Bostock  v.  Clayton  Cnty.,  140  S.  Ct.  1731  (2020)  (Jan.  8,  2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/Q9YC-Q4Y2.   \n148.  Notwithstanding these limits, in May 2021 HHS published guidance purporting to \ninterpret  Section  1557  “consistent  with  …  Bostock”  by  reading  the  statute  to  prohibit \n“[d]iscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity.”  U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Notification of Interpretation and Enforcement \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 44 of 83\nof Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n86 Fed. Reg. 27,984 (May 25, 2021) (“Bostock Notification”). \n149.  In March 2022, HHS doubled down on this view in a second Section 1557 guidance \nletter.  U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, HHS Notice and Guidance \non Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights, and Patient Privacy, (Mar. 2, 2022) (“March 2022 \nGuidance”), https://perma.cc/R4GJ-9CB3.  This guidance reaffirmed the Bostock Notification’s \n“interpretation” of Section 1557.  Id. at 1-2.  HHS further explained that efforts by covered entities \nto restrict access to “gender affirming care” may be treated as discrimination based on an \nindividual’s “gender identity,” in violation of Section 1557. Id.  \n150.  Shortly after HHS published its March 2022 guidance letter, an HHS sub-agency \ncalled the Office of Population Affairs released a two-page memorandum entitled “Gender-\nAffirming Care and Young People.” See Office of Population Affairs, Gender-Affirming Care and \nYoung People, https://perma.cc/H3CS-94KX. In this brief document, the Office of Population \nAffairs asserted that “[r]esearch demonstrates that” so-called “gender-affirming care improves the \nmental health and overall well-being of gender diverse children and adolescents.”  Id. at 1.  It \nfurther asserted that “[f]or transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-\naffirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being.”  Id.  The two-pager prominently \nhighlighted  the  treatment  guidelines  from  the  Endocrine  Society  and  WPATH.    Id.    HHS \nthreatened to sue anyone who disagreed with this purported “standard of care.”  See March 2022 \nGuidance 1-2. \n151.  A federal district court later vacated and set aside as unlawful the March 2022 \nGuidance, finding HHS’s conclusion that “denial of … care solely on the basis of a patient’s sex \nassigned at birth or gender identity likely violates Section 1557” was “arbitrary and capricious.”  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 45 of 83\nTexas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824, 838, 847 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 1, 2022).  Among other things, the \ncourt held that the March 2022 Letter misread Bostock and did not adequately explain how, despite \nthe specific exclusion of “gender identity disorders” from the definition of disability in the \nRehabilitation Act (and hence in Section 1557, see 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a) (incorporating “section \n794 of title 29”)), failure to provide cross-sex hormones or gender-transition surgeries could \namount to discrimination on the basis of a disability.  Id. at 832-38.  Other federal district courts \nenjoined similar efforts to extend Bostock’s reasoning to the Title IX context.  See, e.g., Tennessee \nv. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 839 (E.D. Tenn. 2022); Neese, 640 F. Supp. 3d at 675-78. \nIV.  HHS’s New Attempt to Distort Section 1557 Through the 2024 Rule.  \nA.  The Proposed Rule.  \n152.  In August 2022, HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Section \n1557.  Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, \n87 Fed. Reg. 47,824 (Aug. 4, 2022) (“Proposed Rule”).  \n153.  The Proposed Rule was largely cribbed from the previously enjoined 2016 Rule.  \nLike the 2016 Rule, the Proposed Rule interpreted  Title IX’s—and by implication Section \n1557’s—ban on sex discrimination to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes; sex \ncharacteristics, including intersex traits; pregnancy or related conditions; sexual orientation; and \ngender identity.” Id. at 47858.  \n154.  According to HHS, Bostock’s reasoning “support[ed] the interpretation that Title \nIX’s prohibition of discrimination ‘on the basis of’ sex” extends to discrimination based on a \n“person’s sexual orientation or transgender status.” Id. at 47859.  \n155.  The Proposed Rule broadly defined a “covered entity” as States and any other \n“recipient[s] of Federal financial assistance,” HHS itself, and “an entity established under Title I \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 46 of 83\nof the ACA.” Id. at 47,912.  Like the 2016 Rule, the Proposed Rule explicitly applied to health \ninsurance issuers and administrators.  Id. at 47,918.   \n156.  The Proposed Rule stated that it would be unlawful for a covered entity to “deny[] \nor limit[] health services sought for the purpose of gender-affirming care that the covered entity \nwould provide to a person for other purposes if the denial or limitation is based on a patient’s sex \nassigned at birth, gender identity, or gender otherwise recorded.”  Id. at 47,867.   \n157.  In  HHS’s  telling,  this  mandate  meant  that  if  a  medical  provider  prescribes \ntestosterone to treat a boy’s hormone deficiency, the provider could not categorically refuse to \nprescribe testosterone to treat a gender dysphoric girl who identifies as a boy.  In the same way, if \na provider performs vaginoplasties to treat congenital defects or trauma to a woman’s vagina, that \nprovider could not refuse to perform a “vaginoplasty” on a gender dysphoric male who desires to \nhave his genitals removed and replaced with repurposed tissue intended to replicate the appearance \nof a vagina.  Similar logic would apply across a range of distinct procedures. \n158.  HHS asserted that the Proposed Rule would not “require[] the provision of any \nhealth service where the covered entity has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying or \nlimiting that service, including where the covered entity reasonably determines that such health \nservice is not clinically appropriate for that individual.”  Id. at 47,867.   \n159.  Yet at the same time, the Proposed Rule warned that “a provider’s view that no \ngender transition or other gender-affirming care can ever be beneficial for such individuals (or its \ncompliance with a state or local law that reflects a similar judgment) is not a sufficient basis for a \njudgment that a health service is not clinically appropriate.”  Id.  In other words, HHS proposed to \noverride state laws prohibiting the provision of gender-transition drugs and surgeries to minors for \nthe purpose of treating gender dysphoria. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 47 of 83\n160.  HHS proposed a similar mandate for health insurers.  Like the 2016 Rule, the \nProposed Rule “prohibit[ed] a covered entity from having or implementing a categorical coverage \nexclusion or limitation for all health services related to gender transition or other gender-affirming \ncare”—regardless of the risks and costs.  Id. at 47,871.  And the Proposed Rule went on to instruct \nthat exclusions deeming all “gender-affirming care for transgender people” as “‘experimental’ \nwould result in prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id. at 47,874. \n161.  The upshot is that HHS proposed to limit the ability of providers to exercise \nindependent medical judgment about the medical necessity and appropriateness of sex-transition \nprocedures, and to foreclose insurers from relying on concerns about the efficacy and long-term \nimpacts of these treatments in assessing coverage. \n162.  HHS further proposed to enforce Section 1557’s prohibition against sex-based \ndiscrimination using the “provisions applicable to Title VI to administrative enforcement actions.”  \nId. at 47,828, 47,886.   Noncompliance with HHS’s Section 1557 mandates can result in the \n“suspension or termination” of federal funding or “other action authorized by law.”  Id. at 47919. \n163.  Consistent with the 2016 Rule, the Proposed Rule also included a private right of \naction against covered entities. Id. at 47885. \n164.  HHS also proposed to amend CMS regulations relating to Medicaid, CHIP, and the \nProgram of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”). \n165.  HHS “propos[ed] to reinstate references to sexual orientation and gender identity \nin the Medicaid managed care regulation … that prohibits Medicaid managed care plans from \ndiscriminating against individuals eligible to enroll and from using any policy or practice that has \nthe effect of discriminating on the basis of … sex.”  87 Fed. Reg. 47,893.  And HHS proposed to \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 48 of 83\n“revise the term ‘sex’ in the current regulation text to ‘sex (including sexual orientation and gender \nidentity).’”  Id. \n166.  The Proposed Rule also sought to amend the Medicaid and CHIP regulations to \nrequire that entities that deliver services must “promote the delivery of services in a culturally \ncompetent manner to all enrollees, … and regardless of sex which includes … gender identity.”  \nId. at 47910. \n167.  The Proposed Rule also required State Medicaid and CHIP programs to “have \nmethods to promote access and delivery of services in a culturally competent manner to all \nbeneficiaries … regardless of sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity).”  Id. \n168.  With respect to its PACE regulations, HHS proposed to change the word “sex” to \n“sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity).”  Id. at 47,894.   \nB.  Commenters’ Widespread Objections to HHS’s Proposal. \n169.  Underlining  the  import  of  and  opposition  to  HHS’s  redefinition  of  sex \ndiscrimination under Section 1557, the Proposed Rule generated more than 80,000 comments.1 \n170.  The State of Tennessee and nineteen co-signing States submitted a public comment \ncriticizing the Proposed Rule as unlawful.  See Tenn. Comment Letter (Exhibit B).  \n171.  The States explained that HHS’s interpretation of “sex” to mean “gender identity” \nor “sexual orientation” does not comport with Title IX’s text or plain meaning, and that “the \nProposed Rule [is] an attempt to stretch HHS’s power beyond the text of the statute Congress \nenacted.” Id. at 1, 12.  Further, Tennessee criticized HHS’s reliance on Bostock as support for its \ninterpretation of Section 1557 and Title IX because “the rule in Bostock extends no further than \n \n1  Comments  on  the  Proposed  Rule  are  available  at \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/HHS-OS-2022-0012-0001/comment.  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 49 of 83\nTitle VII.”  Id. at 7.  And, given that Title IX relies on a “biological binary of sex,” the Proposed \nRule ignored relevant statutory structure and historical practice.  Id. at 8.  \n172.  Tennessee  also  provided  several  reasons  that  the  Proposed  Rule  violated \nConstitutional constraints.  For example, the Proposed Rule encouraged regulated parties “to insert \nthemselves  into  constitutionally  protected  family  affairs,”  threatening  families’  Fourteenth \nAmendment Due Process rights.  Id.  Tennessee also reminded HHS of the limits on Congress’s \nspending power, explaining that Section 1557 did not “unambiguously prohibit discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or ‘gender identity.’”  Id. at 12.  For this reason, Tennessee explained, \nthe Spending Clause would not allow HHS to impose a new condition on federal funds, including \nMedicaid funds.  Id. at 12.  Tennessee also argued that the Proposed Rule’s condition on federal \nfunding was unconstitutionally coercive.  Id.  \n173.  Commenters also objected to the Proposed Rule’s approach of establishing national \nstandards of medical care for gender-transition treatment.  Commenters explained that it was \narbitrary and capricious for HHS to fail to consider effects that innate sex differences have on \nhealth.  See EPPC Comment, supra, at 14-16.  And they objected to the lack of medical consensus \nregarding the appropriate means of treating gender dysphoria—particularly for minors—while \nnoting the irreversible nature of certain treatments and the increased prospects of sterilization as \nwell  as  other  associated  risks.    See,  e.g.,  Comment  of  Florida  Agency  for  Healthcare \nAdministration, HHS-OS-2022-0012-69566; Comment of Society for Evidence-Based Gender \nMedicine, HHS-OS-2022-0012-73218; Comment of American College of Pediatricians, at 3-5, \nHHS-OS-2022-0012-74010; EPPC Comment, supra, at 24-34; ADF Comment, supra, at 17-27. \n \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 50 of 83\nC.  Final 2024 Rule. \n174.  On May 6, 2024, HHS finalized the 2024 Rule, which generally will take effect \nJuly 5, 2024.  The 2024 Rule has two parts.  First, HHS’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) \npromulgated regulations purporting to set out funding recipients’ nondiscrimination obligations \nunder Section 1557.  Second, CMS promulgated amendments to separate regulations for specific \naid programs under both Section 1557 and provisions of the Social Security Act (“SSA”) and the \nPublic Health Act (“PHA”). \n1.  OCR Regulations. \n175.  The OCR regulations require that covered entities “provide individuals equal access \nto [their] health programs and activities without discriminating on the basis of sex.”  89 Fed. Reg. \nat 37,770. \n176.  HHS  declared  that  it  was  “not  necessary  to  define  ‘sex’”  for  purposes  of \nimplementing this requirement.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,575.  HHS instead defined “[d]iscrimination \non the basis of sex” to include discriminating based on “(i) Sex characteristics, including intersex \ntraits; (ii) Pregnancy or related conditions; (iii) Sexual orientation; (iv) Gender identity; and (v) \nSex stereotypes.”  Id. at 37,699. \n177.  HHS’s interpretation of this non-discrimination obligation will have immediate and \nindustry-altering consequences.  Under the 2024 Rule, no health facility may “[a]dopt or apply \nany policy or practice” that “prevents an individual from participating in a health program or \nactivity consistent with the individual’s gender identity.”  Id. at 37,701.  That includes the use of \nsex-separated “intimate space[s].”  Id. at 37,593.  So, for example, a covered entity “will be in \nviolation” of the 2024 Rule for refusing to place a transgender person “in facilities consistent with \ntheir gender identity.”  Id.  That means covered entities will be compelled to allow men who \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 51 of 83\nidentify as women to share a room, bathroom, and other private facilities with women, and vice \nversa.  87 Fed. Reg. 47,866-67. \n178.  The OCR Regulations will also dictate the medical treatments and decisions of \nproviders.  Even while recognizing that sex-based characteristics are relevant to providing medical \ncare,  the  2024  Rule  declares  that  “providers  may  use  sex-based  distinctions  to  administer \nindividualized care, provided those distinctions do not cause more than de minimis harm.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 37,594.  But “de minimis harm” is a low bar: HHS suggests that merely “experiencing … \ndistress” is enough to cross that threshold.  Id. at 37,593. \n179.    HHS  specifies  that  no  covered  provider—meaning  most  doctors  across  the \nnation—can  “[d]eny  or  limit  health  services,  including  those  that  have  been  typically  or \nexclusively provided to, or associated with, individuals of one sex, to an individual based upon the \nindividual’s sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or gender otherwise recorded.”  Id. at 37,700.   \n180.  So too, a provider cannot deny “health services sought for purpose of gender \ntransition or other gender-affirming care that the covered entity would provide to an individual for \nother purposes if the denial of limitation is based on sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or gender \notherwise recorded.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701.     \n181.  To translate:  HHS now deems it sex discrimination if a doctor or other medical \nentity declines to provide persons with gender dysphoria any (purportedly) similar treatments as \nthose given to persons with cancer and other physical ailments.  And this mandate has no age \nlimit—meaning it applies equally to minors for whom such interventions are unproven, risky, and \nlife altering.   \n182.  The mandate in OCR’s Regulations extends to all so-called “gender-affirming \ncare,”  which  “includes  hormone  therapy,  surgery,  and  other  related  services.”    Id.    So  “a \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 52 of 83\ngynecological surgeon may be in violation of the rule if they accept a referral for a hysterectomy \nbut later refuse to perform the surgery upon learning” it was sought for purposes of “gender \ntransition.”  87 Fed. Reg. at 47,867.  Or it would be presumptively discriminatory for a clinic to \nprescribe hormone replacement therapy to treat menopause but refuse to provide the same type of \ntherapy for a “gender transition.” \n183.  The  OCR  Regulations  recognize  that  providers  might  have  a  “legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for denying or limiting” a service, such as where the covered entity \ndetermines that a “health service is not clinically appropriate for a particular individual.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 37,701.  But HHS’s view of this concept is narrow.  As HHS puts it, Section 1557’s \nnondiscrimination  mandate  would  not  require  a  doctor  to  provide  “a  prostate  exam  for  a \ntransgender man who does not anatomically have a prostate.”  Id. at 37,607.   \n184.  Otherwise, HHS will evaluate a covered entity’s decision not to provide services \nfor gender-transition purposes based on “medical necessity standards or guidelines” and “the \nclinical,  evidence-based  criteria  or  guidelines  relied  upon  to  make  the  medical  necessity \ndetermination; and the medical substantiation for the medical necessity determination.”  Id. at \n37,613.  HHS signals that the “medical necessity standards” and “guidelines” it will use to evaluate \nthese decisions come from WPATH and the Endocrine Society.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,868.   \n185.  The OCR regulations require that a provider’s decision not to provide gender-\ntransition treatments “must not be based on unlawful animus or bias[] or constitute pretext for \ndiscrimination.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701.  This means that a provider must rationalize why a \ngender-transition  treatment  “is  not  clinically  appropriate  for  a  particular  individual.”    Id. \n(emphasis added).  \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 53 of 83\n186.  Thus, decisions based on the lack of evidence of efficacy and safety of medical \ngender-transition interventions generally—as described by the comprehensive systematic reviews \nthat  have  recently  come  out  of  Europe—“may  be  considered  evidence  of  pretext  for \ndiscrimination.”  Id. at 37,613.  Along the same lines, a provider’s determination that so-called \n“gender-affirming care” is “experimental or cosmetic would be considered evidence of pretext.”  \n87 Fed. Reg. 47,874.   \n187.  HHS  likewise  views  “categorical  exclusions  for  gender  affirming  care”  as \nsuggestive of pretext, even if required by state law.  Id.  As a result, a provider who declines \ntreatment to minors under state laws prohibiting such treatment would engage in “prohibited \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id.   \n188.  HHS’s enforcement decisions are also informed by “consideration of … whether \n[a] covered entity demonstrated a willingness to refer or provide accurate information about \ngender-affirming care.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,598.  But any provider who deviates from the WPATH \nscript risks being found insufficiently willing to provide “accurate information.”  87 Fed. Reg. \n47,784  (citing  WPATH  to  conclude  that  “[c]haracterizing  [gender-transition  treatments]  as \nexperimental or cosmetic … is not based on current standards of medical care”).  HHS requires \nproviders to parrot controversial positions of gender-transition advocates, even when doing so \nwould give patients a false sense of certainty about the efficacy of these treatments. \n189.  The OCR regulations also apply to entities involved in federally funded health \ninsurance and health-related coverage administered by HHS, such as Medicaid and CHIP.  Such \nentities may not discriminate in healthcare coverage, in insurance benefit design, or in marketing \npractices.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701.  And HHS specifically prohibits limits or restrictions on \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 54 of 83\ncoverage or claims, including cost sharing, “based upon [an] individual’s sex assigned at birth, \ngender identity, or gender otherwise recorded.”  Id. \n190.  HHS also prohibits covered entities from denying or limiting “coverage,” denying \nor limiting “coverage of a claim,” or imposing “additional cost sharing or other limitations or \nrestrictions on coverage, for specific health services related to gender transition or gender-\naffirming care if such denial, limitation, or restriction results in discrimination on the basis of sex.”  \nId. (emphasis added).  Thus, even facially neutral insurance policies that tend to screen out services \nused by transgender individuals may be found discriminatory, even if those policies are not \nmotivated by sex or gender identity. \n191.  HHS purports to provide a safe harbor for insurers.  “Nothing in [the rule] requires \ncoverage of any health service where the covered entity has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason \nfor denying or limiting coverage of the health service or determining that such health service fails \nto meet applicable coverage requirements, including reasonable medical management techniques \nsuch as medical necessity requirements.”  Id.  But categorical exclusions of coverage for gender-\ntransition interventions, including surgeries, would be considered unlawful sex discrimination. \n192.  Failing to comply with the OCR regulations puts the States’ federal funding at risk, \nincluding their Medicaid funding.  45 C.F.R. §§ 80.8, 92.303. \n2.  CMS Regulations. \n193.  In addition to amending HHS’s Section 1557 regulations, the 2024 Rule also \namends CMS regulations relating to Medicaid, CHIP programs designed to provide healthcare for \nchildren and pregnant women, and PACE’s program for providing elderly care.  In addition to \nrelying on its authority under Section 1557, CMS claimed authority to make these changes to \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 55 of 83\nMedicaid under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(4), to CHIP under 42 U.S.C. § 1396aa(a) (CHIP), and to \nPACE under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395eee(f), 1396u-4(f) (PACE). \n194.  Under CMS’s revised Medicaid and CHIP regulations, contracts with entities that \ndeliver services must now include a promise that the entities “will not discriminate against \nindividuals eligible to enroll on the basis of … sex which includes sex characteristics, including \nintersex traits; pregnancy or related conditions; sexual orientation; gender identity; and sex \nstereotypes; and will not use any policy or practice that has the effect of discriminating on the basis \nof … sex which includes discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics, including intersex traits; \npregnancy or related conditions; sexual orientation; gender identity; and sex stereotypes.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 37,691 (emphasis added).  Thus, a managed care organization’s facially neutral policies or \npractices that lack any discriminatory purpose that nonetheless have a discriminatory effect on \ntransgender individuals may now violate its contract. \n195.  Entities that deliver services also must “promote the delivery of services in a \nculturally competent manner to all enrollees, … and regardless of sex which includes … gender \nidentity.”  Id. \n196.  Under the 2024 Rule, States’ Medicaid and CHIP programs “must have methods to \npromote access and delivery of services in a culturally competent manner to all beneficiaries, … \nand regardless of sex which includes sex characteristics, including intersex traits; pregnancy or \nrelated conditions; sexual orientation; gender identity; and sex stereotypes.”  Id. at 37,692. \n197.  With  respect  to  its  PACE  regulations,  CMS  likewise  revised  the  regulatory \nlanguage’s reference to “sex” to include “sex characteristics, including intersex traits; pregnancy \nor related conditions; sexual orientation; gender identity; and sex stereotypes.”  89 Fed. Reg. at \n37,669. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 56 of 83\nPLAINTIFFS’ IMPENDING IRREPARABLE HARM \n198.  The 2024 Rule will inflict significant, irreparable harm on the Plaintiff States that \nonly prompt judicial intervention can redress. \nI.  Nonrecoverable Compliance Costs. \n199.  First,  Plaintiff  States  would  suffer  the  “irreparable  harm  of  nonrecoverable \ncompliance costs.”  R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 194 (5th Cir. 2023) (citation \nomitted).   \n200.  The 2024 Rule acknowledges as much.  HHS estimates that the cost of revising \nrelevant policies and procedures to comply with the 2024 Rule will result in a one-time cost of $65 \nmillion across all covered entities.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,680.  It predicts the initial cost of training \nemployees on the 2024 Rule across all covered entities will be more than $927 million, with \nongoing annual training estimated to cost another $309 million per year.  Id. at 37,679, 37,680.  \nAnd it estimates that required annual recordkeeping will cost millions more.  Id. at 37,682.   \n201.  Because  TennCare’s  administrative  rules  for  the  State’s  Medicaid  and  CHIP \nprograms exclude coverage for gender-transition surgeries, compliance with the 2024 Rule would \nrequire amending those rules through formal rulemaking.  The rulemaking process is governed by \nthe Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act and takes approximately nine months to \ncomplete.  That process includes rule drafting, obtaining the review and approval of the offices of \nthe Governor and Attorney General, posting for public comment, a rulemaking hearing, and a \nhearing before the Joint Government Operations Committee of the Tennessee legislature. \nII.  Derogation of Plaintiff States’ Sovereignty. \n202.  Second,  enforcement  of  the  2024  Rule  would  undermine  Plaintiff  States’ \nsovereignty.  “[T]he State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical profession,” \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 57 of 83\nGonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007), as well as “an interest in protecting the integrity \nand ethics of the medical profession,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997).  This \nincludes “maintaining high standards of professional conduct” in the practice of medicine.  Barsky \nv. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of N.Y., 347 U.S. 442, 451 (1954). \n203.  The State also “has an interest in protecting vulnerable groups … from mistakes,” \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. U.S. at 731, and in “the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric \nmedical procedures,” Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 301 (2022).  It is \nalso “evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State’s interest in ‘safeguarding the physical \nand psychological well-being of a minor’ is ‘compelling.’”  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, \n756-57 (1982) (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)). \n204.  As discussed, Plaintiff States have adopted laws prohibiting healthcare providers \nfrom offering gender-transition treatments to minors.  See supra, ¶¶ 107-09, 117-18, 126, 128, \n130-36.  Tennessee, Mississippi, and other Plaintiff States have likewise chosen not to cover \ncertain  gender-transition  interventions—including  sex-reassignment  surgeries—through  their \nMedicaid or state employee health programs.  See supra, ¶¶ 112-13, 116, 121-126, 129, 132-35.  \nPlaintiff States will be unable to enforce these duly enacted laws and longstanding policies without \ncoming into conflict with the 2024 Rule. \n205.  States  have  “sovereign  interests  in  enforcing  their  duly  enacted  state  laws.”  \nTennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 841.  Thus, “irreparable harm exists when a federal regulation \nprevents a state from enforcing its duly enacted laws.”  Texas v. Becerra, 577 F. Supp. 3d 527, 557 \n(N.D. Tex. 2021) (collecting cases).     \n \n \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 58 of 83\nIII.  Threatened Loss of Federal Funding and Civil Liability. \n206.  Third, enforcement of the 2024 Rule threatens to collectively strip Plaintiff States \nof tens of billions of dollars in federal HHS funds and to impose substantial penalties through \nprivate suits.  This severe financial exposure endangers important health programs that serve some \nof the Plaintiff States’ most vulnerable residents. \n207.  For example, TennCare administers Tennessee’s Medicaid program, as well as \nCoverKids and its PACE program for the elderly.  TennCare annually serves nearly 1.5 million \nTennesseans, including low-income individuals, pregnant women, children, caretaker relatives of \nyoung children, older adults, and those with disabilities.   \n208.  TennCare received approximately $10.3 billion in HHS funding for State Fiscal \nYear 2022-2023.  That includes more than $10.2 billion for Tennessee’s Medicaid program, $109.8 \nmillion for CoverKids (CHIP), and $10.8 million for the State’s PACE program.  \n209.  All are regulated by the 2024 Rule.  Yet Tennessee’s Medicaid and CHIP programs \neach categorically exclude coverage for gender-transition surgeries, which the 2024 Rule prohibits.  \nSee Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1200-13-13-.10(a)(72), 1200-13-21-.06(1). \n210.  Tennessee thus faces a credible threat that HHS will enforce the 2024 Rule against \nit and terminate substantial federal financial assistance to noncomplying state entities.  The 2024 \nRule also subjects Tennessee to civil liability through Section 1557’s private right of action.   \n211.  The same goes for Mississippi and many of the other Plaintiff States.  See supra, \n¶¶ 23-31. \nIV.  Fiscal Costs of Covering Gender-Transition Interventions. \n212.  Fourth, the 2024 Rule’s mandate that health insurers cover gender-transition drugs \nand surgeries will inevitably result in increased costs for each health plan.   \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 59 of 83\n213.  According to WPATH 8, the purportedly medically necessary drug interventions \nfor gender transition include: \na.  Prescribing and administering puberty blockers off-label; and \nb.  Prescribing supraphysiological levels of cross-sex hormones off-label and related \nvisits and tests. \nWPATH 8, supra, at S110. \n214.  According to WPATH 8, the purportedly “medically necessary” so-called “gender-\naffirming surgical procedures,” id. at S18, S128, include the following: \na.  “Hysterectomy” (removal of healthy uterus); \nb.  “Mastectomy” (removal of healthy breasts); \nc.  “Salpingo-oophorectomy” (removal of healthy ovaries and fallopian tubes); \nd.  “Orchiectomy” (removal of healthy testicles); \ne.  “Phalloplasty” (constructing penis-like structure using tissue from skin), including \n“urethral lengthening,” “prosthesis,” “colpectomy” (closure of healthy vagina), \n“colpoclesis” (shortening of healthy vagina), and “scrotoplasty” (creating new \nscrotums); \nf.  “Metoidioplasty” (constructing penis-like structure using tissue from a hormone-\nenlarged clitoris), including “urethral lengthening,” “prosthesis,” “colpectomy” \n(closure of healthy vagina), “colpoclesis” (shortening of healthy vagina), and \n“scrotoplasty” (creating new scrotums); \ng.  “Vaginoplasty” (constructing vagina-like structure), including methods of “[penile] \ninversion”  (using  combination  of  skin  surrounding  penis  and  scrotal  skin), \n“peritoneal  [flaps  pull-through]”  (pulling  down  peritoneum  (inner  lining  of \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 60 of 83\nabdominal wall) into space between rectum and urethra/prostate), and “intestinal” \ntechnique (using section of terminal large intestine); \nh.  “Vulvoplasty” (constructing vulva-like structures); \ni.  “Hair line advancement and/or hair transplant;” \nj.  “Facelift/mid-face lift (following alteration of the underlying skeletal structures);” \nk.  “Platysmaplasty” (neck lift); \nl.  “Blepharoplasty” (eye and lid modification); \nm. “Rhinoplasty” (nose reshaping); \nn.  “Cheek” surgery, including “implant[s]” and “lipofilling;” \no.  “Lip” surgery, including “augmentation” and “upper lip shortening;” \np.  “Lower jaw” surgery, including “augmentation” and “reduction of the mandibular \nangle” (cutting or shaving the corner of the lower jaw);  \nq.  “Chin reshaping” surgery; \nr.  “Chondrolaryngoplasty” (shaving down Adam’s apple); \ns.  “Vocal cord surgery;” \nt.  “Breast reconstruction” and “augmentation” (mammoplasty); \nu.  “Body contouring” surgeries, including “liposuction,” “lipofilling,” and “implants” \n(such as “pectoral, hip, gluteal, [and] calf”); \nv.  “Monsplasty” (reduction of mons pubis tissue around the pubic bone, which is more \npronounced in females); \nw.  “Nipple-areola tattoo;” \nx.  “Uterine transplantation” (uterus from donor); \ny.  “Penile transplantation” (penis from donor); and \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 61 of 83\nz.  “Hair  removal,”  including  “laser  epilation”  (laser  removal)  or  “electrolysis” \n(permanent removal by destroying hair follicles), “from the face, body and genital \nareas.” \nId. at S258, App’x E (cleaned up).  WPATH makes clear that the above list “is not intended to be \nexhaustive.”  Id. \n215.  According to one study used by HHS in its economic-impact analysis of the 2024 \nRule, “the average cost of transition-related care (surgery, hormones, or both) per person needing \ntreatment was $29,929 over 6.5 years,” or approximately $4,600 per year.  Aaron Belkin, Caring \nfor Our Transgender Troops—The Negligible Cost of Transition-Related Care, 373 New Eng. J. \nMed. 1089 (2015).   \n216.  According to the Williams Institute, 0.52% of adults and 0.74% of adolescents in \nTennessee  identify  as  transgender.    See  Williams  Institute,  Transgender  People, \nhttps://perma.cc/2FNL-G3ZP (last visited May 30, 2024). \n217.  As of May 2024, approximately 670,000 adults were enrolled in Tennessee’s \nMedicaid program, and approximately 824,000 minors were enrolled in Tennessee’s Medicaid and \nCHIP programs.  On top of that, roughly 115,000 adults and nearly 30,000 minors are enrolled in \nTennessee’s State Plan for state and higher education employees.   \n218.  Mississippi’s  Medicaid  and  CHIP  programs  are  expected  to  provide  health \ninsurance coverage for nearly 752,000 in Fiscal Year 2024.  Thousands more are enrolled in \nMississippi’s State Plan. \n219.  As  of  May  2024,  approximately  345,000  adults  were  enrolled  in  Alabama’s \nMedicaid program, and approximately 719,000 minors were enrolled in Alabama’s Medicaid and \nCHIP programs.  Thousands more were enrolled in Alabama’s State Plan. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 62 of 83\n220.  As  of  April  2024,  approximately  842,652  adults  were  enrolled  in  Georgia’s \nMedicaid program, and approximately 1,452,001 minors were enrolled in Georgia’s Medicaid and \nCHIP programs.   \n221.  As of April 2024, more than 1 million adults were enrolled in Indiana’s Medicaid \nprogram, and more than 800,000 minors were enrolled in Indiana’s Medicaid and CHIP programs.  \n222.  As of May 2024, approximately 1.5 million adults were enrolled in Kentucky’s \nMedicaid program and almost 530,000 children were enrolled in Medicaid. \n223.  As of December 2023, approximately 3.6 million Ohioans were enrolled in the \nState’s Medicaid program, with approximately 1.5 million children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.  \n224.  As of May 2024, approximately 1,212,000 adults were enrolled in Virginia’s \nMedicaid program, and approximately 782,000 minors were enrolled in Virginia’s Medicaid and \nCHIP programs. \n225.  Covered plans of the remaining Plaintiff States collectively provide health benefits \nto millions more individuals. \n226.  Based on the demographic estimates from the Williams Institute, that means there \nare likely thousands of people enrolled across the Plaintiff States’ covered plans who identify as \ntransgender. \n227.  Thus,  the  2024  Rule’s  gender-transition  mandate  will  undoubtedly  have  a \n“substantial” fiscal effect on Plaintiff States.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,683.  And again, any monies the \nStates expend as a result of the 2024 Rule could not later be recovered—even if the States \nultimately prevail in their legal challenge.    \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 63 of 83\nV.  Threat to the Health and Safety of Vulnerable Citizens. \n228.  Finally, the 2024 Rule will ultimately subject some of Tennessee’s most vulnerable \ncitizens to a gender-transition protocol that will leave them with irreversible side effects—\nincluding sterilization—and increased health risks for the rest of their lives. \n229.  The most recent systematic review of the available evidence, published in April \n2024, only confirms prior concerns of leading national health authorities abroad and in many States \nat home regarding the lack of quality evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of medical gender \ntransition, particularly for minors.  See The Cass Review, Independent review of gender identity \nservices  for  children  and  young  people:  Final  Report  (April  2024),  available  at \nhttps://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/.   \n230.  This evidence review highlighted the “weak evidence” regarding the impact of \npuberty  blockers  on  gender  dysphoria  and  their  still  unknown  effect  on  “cognitive  and \npsychological development.”  Id.  It further noted that the use of cross-sex hormones to treat gender \ndysphoria in minors “presents many unknowns” due to the “lack of long-term follow-up data,” \nwhich leaves “inadequate information about the range of outcomes for this group.”  Id. \n231.  Clinicians are still unable to determine with any certainty which gender dysphoric \nyouth will go on to have an enduring transgender identity.  Id.  That is alarming, given that gender \ndysphoria for most children naturally resolves by the time they reach adulthood if not subjected to \ntransitioning interventions.  Levine, supra, at 40-45. \n232.  Although a growing number of detransitioners have come forward to shed light on \nthe permanent consequences they have endured because of the gender-transition protocol, public \nadvocacy and delayed justice through private lawsuits against their medical providers cannot \nreverse their chemical or surgical sterilization or restore their lost adolescence. \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 64 of 83\nCLAIM I \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \nThe 2024 Rule Unlawfully Defines “on the Basis of Sex” \n \n233.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n234.  HHS is a federal agency within the meaning of the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n235.  The 2024 Rule is “final agency action” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n236.  Plaintiff States lack another adequate remedy in court, and no rule requires that they \nappeal to a superior agency authority before seeking judicial review. \n237.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C); see Data Mktg. P’ship, LP v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 45 \nF.4th 846, 859 (5th Cir. 2022).   \n238.  The 2024 Rule exceeds HHS’s statutory authority because it defines discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” in a manner contrary to Section 1557 and Title IX.   \n239.  The text of neither Section 1557 nor Title IX mentions “sexual orientation” or \n“gender identity” as protected categories.  Instead, Congress expressly limited Title IX’s coverage \nto discrimination “on the basis of sex,” and the ordinary public meaning of “sex” at the time of \nTitle IX’s enactment unambiguously excludes consideration of a person’s gender identity.  See \nAdams, 57 F.4th at 812.  If the plain meaning of Title IX was not enough, the statute’s structure, \nhistory, and purpose confirm that “sex” is limited to the traditional biological binary of male and \nfemale.  Indeed, it makes perfect sense to import Title IX’s understanding of “sex”—and sex \ndiscrimination—into Section 1557 because, much like in the educational context where differential \ntreatment on the basis of sex may be warranted (e.g., facilities, sports teams), healthcare also \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 65 of 83\nrequires different treatment based on biological realities.  Men and women have different health \nneeds based on biological sex.   \n240.  Other structural features of the statute confirm the invalidity of HHS’s reading.  The \nACA elsewhere references “sexual orientation,” see 42 U.S.C. § 294e-1(b)(2), signaling that if \nCongress wished to prohibit LGBTQ+ discrimination in Section 1557, it knew how to do so.  \n241.  Section 1557, moreover, specifically excludes from its scope “transsexualism” and \na “gender identity disorder” “not resulting from physical impairments.”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a) \n(prohibiting discrimination “on the ground prohibited under … section 794 of title 29”); 29 U.S.C. \n§ 705(20)(F)(i) (providing that “transsexualism” and “gender identity disorders not resulting from \nphysical impairments” are not a “disability” under section 794).  Those terms at the time were \nsynonymous with having a transgender identity, so transgender persons that do not have a disorder \nof sex development—a physical impairment—do not have a “disability” and are excluded from \n“section 792 of title 29.”   \n242.  The 2024 Rule nonetheless states that “sex” discrimination prohibited by Title IX—\nand incorporated by Section 1557—includes discrimination based on “sexual orientation” and \n“gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. 37,698-99.   \n243.  The 2024 Rule rests on Bostock for this result.  But Bostock explicitly declined to \n“prejudge” whether other nondiscrimination laws—like Title IX—prohibit discrimination based \non sexual orientation and transgender status, or whether its ruling affected common practices like \nmaintaining sex-separated “bathrooms.”  590 U.S. at 681.  Thus, as many federal courts have held, \n“the rule in Bostock extends no further than Title VII.”  Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d \n318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he Court in Bostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision \nand how it was limited only to Title VII itself.”). And “it does not follow that principles announced \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 66 of 83\nin the Title VII context automatically apply in the Title IX context.”  Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 \nF.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021). \n244.  Nor can Chevron deference save the 2024 Rule’s misinterpretation of Title IX and \nSection 1557.  For starters, HHS’s reading falls outside the range of reasonable interpretations of \nthe statutory text because it purports to resolve a policy issue of major political significance \nwithout clear congressional authority, see West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721-24 (2022), and \nfails to construe “on the basis of sex” “to avoid serious constitutional doubts,” Brawner v. Scott \nCnty., 14 F.4th 585, 592 n.2 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting FCC v. Fox Tel. Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n516  (2009));  see  also  infra  Claim  III.    And  to  the  extent  Chevron  would  permit  HHS’s \ninterpretation, that decision should be reconsidered.  Cf. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, No. \n22-451 (U.S.) (argued Jan. 17, 2024) (presenting question “[w]hether the Court should overrule \nChevron”). \n245.  These problems all infect and render unlawful HHS’s amendments to its OCR \nRegulations.  They also preclude HHS’s amendments to its regulations related to Medicaid, CHIP, \nand PACE to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity under Section 1557 as well as \nprovisions of the Social Security Act.  For the reasons already discussed, Section 1557 does not \nwarrant those changes to the CMS Regulations.   \n246.  Neither does the Social Security Act.  Section 1902(a) of the SSA, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(4)(A), requires State plans to provide “such methods of administration … as are found \nby the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan.”  Non-\ndiscrimination rules are not “methods of administration.”  HHS’s interpretation of Section 1902 as \nproviding carte blanche authority to impose requirements on State Medicaid plans is inconsistent \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 67 of 83\nwith the statutory text and violates the “clear notice” requirements for Spending Clause legislation \nand the major questions doctrine. \n247.  Section 2101(a) of the SSA, id. § 1397aa, also does not authorize HHS’s gender-\nidentity mandate for CHIP.  This provision does not grant HHS rulemaking authority or otherwise \nsupport HHS’s interpretation of “sex” discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.  HHS’s interpretation of this section is inconsistent with the text and statutory context, as \nwell as the “clear notice” required by the Spending Clause and the major questions doctrine. \n248.  Section 1894(f)(A) and 1934(f)(A) of the SSA, 42 U.S.C. § 1395eee(f); id. § 1396u-\n4(f), similarly do not give HHS authority to impose its gender identity mandate.  HHS’s reading \nof these provisions to afford near limitless rulemaking authority is contrary to statutory text and \ncontext, as well as the “clear notice” required by the Spending Clause and the major question \ndoctrine. \n249.  Because the 2024 Rule’s interpretation of Section 1557 and related provisions \ncontravenes the statutory text and bedrock canons of statutory interpretation, it is not entitled to \ndeference and exceeds HHS’s legal authority.  The 2024 Rule should thus be declared unlawful \nand “set aside”—meaning vacated.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); see also Career Colls. & Sch. of Tex. \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (collecting authorities). \nCLAIM II \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C) \nThe 2024 Rule Unlawfully Regulates the Practice of Medicine  \n \n250.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n251.  HHS further exceeds its statutory authority because the 2024 Rule pervasively \nregulates the practice of medicine—a matter within the traditional authority of the States and which \nCongress has not authorized the agency to regulate.  This arbitrary expansion of HHS’s authority \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 68 of 83\nharms providers within Plaintiff States—including those health professionals the States employ \ndirectly. \n252.  Congress does not use “muffled hints” or “obscure” language to give federal \nagencies  “authority  to  regulate  areas  traditionally  supervised  by  the  States’  police  power.”  \nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 274 (2006).  Agencies possess that authority only when \nCongress grants it to them clearly.   \n253.  “There is no question that state and local authorities possess considerable power to \nregulate public health,” and regulate the ethics and standards of medical professionals. NFIB v. \nOSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 121 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  HHS thus must point to “exceedingly \nclear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance between federal and state power” in \nthe field of medical regulation.  See U.S. Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Preservation Ass’n, \n590 U.S. 604, 622 (2020).   \n254.  Applying that principle in Gonzales, the Supreme Court refused to read the federal \nControlled Substances Act to give the U.S. Attorney General the power “to prohibit doctors from \nprescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide.”  546 U.S. at 248-49, 275.  \nReading federal law otherwise would have allowed a federal agency “to effect a radical shift of \nauthority from the States to the Federal Government to define general standards of medical practice \nin every locality”—without any clear grant of authority.  Id. at 275. \n255.  These principles require invalidating the 2024 Rule, which prolifically directs (and \nhampers) health providers’ practice of medicine and ousts States from their traditional role as \nregulators of the medical profession and medical ethics.  Examples of HHS’s improper overreach \nabound.   \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 69 of 83\n256.  First, the 2024 Rule regulates how covered health entities run their facilities.  That \nincludes inhibiting entities from maintaining sex-separated “intimate space[s].”  89 Fed. Reg. at \n37,593.  According to HHS, covered entities will be guilty of sex discrimination if they “refuse to \nplace [a transgender person] in facilities consistent with their gender identity,” i.e., if they maintain \nwomen’s-only or men’s-only spaces.  Id.  That mandate will undermine the medical treatment of \nthose whose intimate spaces have been invaded.  \n257.  Second, the 2024 Rule risks punishing doctors who decline to provide medically \ninappropriate care.  The 2024 Rule declares that “providers may use sex-based distinctions to \nadminister individualized care,” but only if “those distinctions do not cause more than de minimis \nharm.”  Id. at 37,594.  As discussed, “de minimis harm” is a low bar that HHS says even emotional \n“distress” would exceed.  Id. at 37,593. Under the final rule, then, if a male patient seeks OBGYN \nservices from a covered entity, and that entity declines to provide those services on the ground that \nthey are inappropriate for a male, then the entity would face legal liability for sex discrimination \nif that male patient claims to have suffered “distress.”   \n258.  Likewise, the 2024 Rule risks deeming doctors guilty of sex discrimination simply \nfor  hewing  to  well-settled  and  scientifically  grounded  understandings  about  “sex”  and  the \nattendant medical consequences. The 2024 Rule pledges: “There is no part of section 1557 that \ncompels clinicians to provide a service that they do not believe is medically appropriate for a \npatient or that they are not qualified to provide.”  Id. at 37,575.  But that pledge is hollow, and the \nfinal rule elsewhere defies that promise. The 2024 Rule is clear: “Discrimination based on sex \ncharacteristics  is  a  prohibited  form  of  sex  discrimination  because  discrimination  based  on \nanatomical or physiological sex characteristics is inherently sex-based.”  Id. at 37,576; see id. at \n37,575 (“discrimination based on anatomical or physiological sex characteristics is inherently sex-\n69 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 70 of 83\nbased”).  Thus, if a doctor believes that removing cancerous breast tissue can be surgically \nappropriate and is willing to perform such a surgery in line with that medical judgment, the 2024 \nRule requires him also to surgically remove the healthy breast tissue of a patient suffering from \ngender dysphoria—even if that procedure defies the doctor’s medical judgment. \n259.  Third,  the  2024  Rule  also  invades  the  doctor-patient  relationship.    HHS \nacknowledges that “[p]roviders often need to make inquiries about a patient’s sex-related medical \nhistory, health status, or physical traits related to sex in the course of providing care.”  Id. at 37,595.  \nAlthough HHS claims that “this rule does not prohibit or inhibit that,” all the agency is willing to \ncommit to is that such basic health-related inquiries “are not per se discriminatory.” Id.  If a patient \n“makes clear that further inquiries are unwelcome,” however, “the inquiries may rise to the level \nof harassment on the basis of sex.”  Id.  Suppose a doctor sees a patient seeking a life-altering and \npotentially dangerous gender-transition procedure, and the doctor responsibly asks the many \nquestions needed to assess and inform the patient of the soundness of the procedure and dangers \ninvolved.  If the patient declines that line of questioning but the doctor insists on doing her duty to \nassess and inform, the doctor risks liability for sex discrimination. Fears of that sort of liability \nwill chill and undermine the doctor-patient relationship and resulting care.  \n260.  Fourth, the 2024 Rule imposes a national standard of care for gender dysphoria \nwithout congressional authorization.  The 2024 Rule mandates that nearly all doctors nationwide \nprovide treatments pushed by an international organization recently shown to lack scientific and \nethical rigor, see 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,834 n.139 (citing standards from WPATH).  Providers are \nprohibited from exercising their own reasonable medical judgment about the appropriateness and \nsafety of sex-transition procedures generally.  Nor can they decline to provide sex-transition \nprocedures based on the experimental nature of those procedures.  Instead, to receive federal \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 71 of 83\nfunding from Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs, doctors—including employees of Plaintiff \nStates—must perform sex-transition procedures even if those procedures are against their medical \njudgment and the subject of serious dispute in the medical community.   \n261.  Making matters worse, the 2024 Rule’s gender-transition-intervention mandate \npurports  to  nullify  contrary  state  laws  limiting  the  provision  of  gender-transition  medical \ninterventions to minors.  The 2024 Rule openly deems preempted those state laws or regulations \nreflecting the judgment that gender-transition interventions such as hormones and surgeries are \nnot clinically appropriate to treat psychological distress arising from gender dysphoria in minors.  \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,535, 37,598.  These state laws permissibly reflect that the safety, efficacy, \nand  appropriateness  of  “gender-transition”  interventions  are  disputed  matters  on  which \npolicymakers may “reasonably exercise caution.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 477.  Yet the 2024 Rule \noverrides those laws without demonstrating that this result was “the clear and manifest purpose of \nCongress.”  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009) (citation omitted).  General preemption \nprinciples foreclose this result.   \n262.   In short, the 2024 Rule seeks to transform the practice of medicine across the \ncountry by dictating what treatments must be provided, how doctors must interact with patients, \nwhat doctors may say or not say, what doctors must affirm to be true or untrue, and more.  But \nHHS’s cited statutes fail to “effect” this “radical shift of authority from the States to the Federal \nGovernment” on sound medical practice.  Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 275.  And the 2024 Rule flouts \nthe limits of Section 1554 of the ACA, which prohibits HHS from interfering with providers’ \npractice of medicine.  Section 1554 bars HHS from adopting any rule that “impede[s] timely access \nto health care services”; “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment \noptions between the patient and the provider”; “restricts the ability of health care professionals to \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 72 of 83\nprovide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions”; or \n“violates the principles of informed consent and the ethical standards of health care professionals.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 18114(2)-(5).  As discussed, HHS’s 2024 Rule breaches all these limits, and then \nsome. \n263.  Because the 2024 Rule’s nationalization of medical care along HHS’s preferred \nideological lines exceeds HHS’s authority, the 2024 Rule should be declared unlawful, “set aside,” \nand vacated.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nCLAIM III \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) \nThe 2024 Rule Is Contrary to the U.S. Constitution  \n264.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n265.  The APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “contrary to \nconstitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”    5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(B);  see  also  id. \n§ 706(2)(A); Data Mktg. P’ship, 45 F.4th at 859. \n266.  The 2024 Rule is unconstitutional, and thus unlawful, for several reasons. \n267.  Spending Clause.  Congress passed Section 1557 under the Spending Clause of the \nUnited States Constitution.  “[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the \nnature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed \nconditions.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 815 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17). That framework means \nthat “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys [under its Spending \nClause authority], it must do so unambiguously.”  Id. (citation omitted).  This “clear-statement \nrule”  applies  with  special  strength  when  a  federal-funding  condition  “encroache[s]  upon  a \ntraditional state power,” such as the regulation of health care.  Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th 325, \n354 (6th Cir. 2022); see also L.W., 83 F.4th at 473-74. \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 73 of 83\n268.  Nowhere in Section 1557, Title IX, the Social Security Act, or anywhere else has \nCongress permitted HHS to regulate “nondiscrimination” based on gender identity—let alone issue \nrules that contain the 2024 Rule’s sweeping gender-identity mandates.  See supra Claims I-II.  Nor \ncan HHS’s 2024 Rule itself provide notice to satisfy the Spending Clause clear-statement rule.  As \nthe Fifth Circuit has held, the “needed clarity” to satisfy the Spending Clause “cannot be … \nprovided” by “regulations clarifying an ambiguous statute.”  Tex. Educ. Agency v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 992 F.3d 350, 361 (5th Cir. 2021).  Instead, it “must come directly from the statute.”  Id.       \n269.  Independently, Congress is forbidden under the Spending Clause from wielding the \nFederal purse as “a ‘weapon[] of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states.”  \nSee NFIB, 567 U.S. at 579 (quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 586 (1937)).  \nThus, Congress exceeds its Spending Clause authority when it offers a financial inducement that \nis “so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns to compulsion.’”  South Dakota v. \nDole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987) (citation omitted).   \n270.  HHS’s 2024 Rule conditions hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding for \nPlaintiff States—amounts representing large portions of their overall budgets, see supra, ¶¶ 22-\n31—on States’ ceding their longstanding power to regulate permissible medical procedures and \nperforming controversial treatments causing proven, life-long harms.  Just as in NFIB, linking \nStates’ Medicaid funding to their following HHS’s controversial federal mandate for gender-\ntransition interventions is an unlawful “gun to the head” of States that violates the Spending \nClause’s anti-coercion limit.  567 U.S. at 581.  That the “States, not the Federal Government, are \nthe traditional source of authority over safety, health, and public welfare” further compounds the \nfederalism harms inflicted by HHS’s coercive regime.  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 609 (6th \nCir. 2022) (citation omitted). \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 74 of 83\n271.  Nondelegation Doctrine.  To the extent HHS asserts authority to define new \npractices  that  violate  Section  1557,  it  transgresses  “the  Constitution’s  rule  vesting  federal \nlegislative  power  in  Congress,”  not  agencies  acting  by  “pen-and-phone  regulations.”  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. 737, 753 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Reading “sex” as a term capacious enough \nto encompass a controversial gender-identity mandate, among other novel ideas, would shift \n“unfettered” lawmaking power to the Department in a manner the nondelegation doctrine does not \ntolerate.  See Tiger Lily, LLC v. U. S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 672 (6th Cir. \n2021). \n272.  Moreover, to the extent that HHS predicates its new regulations on the “medical \nnecessity standards” and “guidelines” issued by WPATH and the Endocrine Society, they violate \nthe private nondelegation doctrine.  See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936).  \nHanding off regulatory authority to private parties is “legislative delegation in its most obnoxious \nform; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body, presumptively disinterested, \nbut to private persons whose interests may be and often are adverse to the interests of others in the \nsame business”—or the public welfare.  Id.; see also Dep’t of Transp. v. Ass’n of Am. Railroads, \n575 U.S. 43, 60-64 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring). \n273.  Eleventh Amendment.  The Eleventh Amendment provides that the “Judicial power \nof the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or \nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects \nof any Foreign States.”  U.S. Const. amend. XI.  As a result of this limit, there are only two \ncircumstances in which an individual may bring a suit against a State in federal court.  First, a \nState may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to being sued.  See College Sav. Bank v. \nFla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 670 (1999).  Second, Congress may \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 75 of 83\nabrogate a state’s sovereign immunity through legislation enacted pursuant to its Section 5 \nenforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. \n274.  Neither scenario applies here.  As discussed, the statute does not condition—let \nalone do so clearly—States’ HHS funding on their following the 2024 Rule’s gender-identity \nmandates.  See supra Claim I.  Nor could HHS’s attempt to apply 1557 to gender-identity \ndiscrimination  pass  Section  5  muster,  including  because  gender  identity  is  not  a  suspect \ncharacteristic and HHS has offered no evidence that the ACA was passed in response to a \ndocumented history of discrimination against transgender individuals.  See City of Boerne v. \nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 529-36 (1997).  The 2024 Rule thus cannot constitutionally subject States \nto private suits for money damages.   \n275.  Because the 2024 Rule is unconstitutional in the ways described above, it should \nbe declared unlawful, “set aside,” and vacated.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).   \nCLAIM IV \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nThe 2024 Rule Is Arbitrary and Capricious \n276.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n277.  The APA requires courts to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious,” \nor an “abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n278.  A federal agency acts in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it (1) attempts \nto regulate based “on factors … Congress has not intended it to consider”; (2) “entirely fail[s] to \nconsider an important aspect of the [regulatory] problem”; (3) “offers an explanation for” its \nconduct “that runs counter to the evidence before” it; or (4) reaches a determination that “is so \nimplausible … it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or … agency expertise.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 76 of 83\n279.  The 2024 Rule’s gender-identity mandates are arbitrary and capricious. \n280.  First, HHS failed to offer a “reasoned explanation” of the 2024 Rule’s departure \nfrom the historic understanding of “sex” as used in Title IX.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016).  If anything, HHS’s history of shifting positions on the meaning of “sex” \ndemonstrates that HHS’s purported Bostock-based justifications for the 2024 Rule are nothing \nmore than “contrived reasons” offered to support a predetermined result.  Dep’t of Commerce v. \nNew York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2576 (2019).  \n281.  Second, the 2024 Rule never defines “sex.”  But without defining sex, HHS cannot \nreasonably explain what it means to discriminate “on the basis of” sex.  HHS failed to adequately \nconsider that in medical practice, as in education, differences between the sexes are a biological \nreality.  HHS’s 2020 Rule previously conceded as much:  It explained that preferencing ideology \nover science “risk[s] masking clinically relevant, and sometimes vitally important, information”—\nlike potential pregnancy in a transgender male.  85 Fed. Reg. at 37,189-90.  But the 2024 Rule \ndoes not engage with the biological and medical realities that sex has in medical care, or the “life-\nand-death” risks associated with ignoring them.  Id. at 37,190. \n282.  Third, by requiring healthcare professionals to ignore the medical and biological \ndifferences between the sexes at the risk of causing “more than de minimis harm,” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n37,593-94, the 2024 Rule will prevent healthcare professionals from using their reasonable \nmedical judgment and will damage the doctor-patient relationship, thus undermining the provision \nof sound medical treatment on a wide scale. \n283.  Fourth, HHS’s decision to embrace the WPATH Standards and Endocrine Society \nGuideline runs counter to the evidence before the agency.  Commenters presented numerous \nstudies and scholarly reviews showing that the “standards” advocated by these medical interest \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 77 of 83\ngroups  are  based  on  weak  evidence  and  that  there  is  no  consensus  on  gender-transition \ninterventions.  The 2024 Rule instead replaces science-based medicine with ideology-driven \nmandates. \n284.  Fifth, HHS “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43, namely the numerous negative side effects associated with “gender-\naffirming care.”  HHS never acknowledged, for example, that its preferred “standard of care” may \nrender an untold number of minors and adults infertile for the rest of their lives.  HHS needs to \nconsider that disadvantage.  \n285.  Sixth, HHS failed to consider whether requiring providers to “affirm” gender \nideology and to use patients’ preferred pronouns instead of ones that are biologically accurate will \ndrive providers out of Medicaid and CHIP.  The potential shortage of providers and its harm to \nMedicaid and CHIP recipients is an “important aspect of the problem” that HHS failed to consider.  \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nCLAIM V \nRelief Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 5 U.S.C. § 706 \nClaim for Declaratory Judgment Against Defendants \n \n286.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n287.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that in the case of an “actual controversy \nwithin its jurisdiction … any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, \nmay declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). \n288.  This case presents an actual controversy.  The 2024 Rule governs Plaintiff States, \nmeaning its requirements affect their legal rights.  Moreover, the imminent enforcement of HHS’s \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 78 of 83\n2024 Rule threatens to force recipients of federal HHS funding in the Plaintiff States to choose \nbetween violating state law and abandoning consistent policies or losing their federal funding. \n289.  The controversy arises in this Court’s jurisdiction, as it relates to questions of \nfederal law.  Venue is proper, as the State of Mississippi resides in this District.  28 U.S.C. § \n1391(e). \n290.  As set forth throughout this Complaint, the Plaintiff States have filed an appropriate \npleading to have their rights declared.  The Court can resolve this controversy by declaring that \nPlaintiff States have a right to receive HHS funding notwithstanding their respective state laws \nand administrative rules prohibiting gender-transition interventions for minors and excluding \ngender-transition interventions from their state-sponsored health insurance plans. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nAn  actual  controversy  exists  between  the  parties  that  entitles  the  Plaintiff  States  to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \na)  Enter a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Defendants, and any other agency or employee of the United \nStates, from enforcing or implementing the portions of the 2024 Rule that exceed \nHHS’s statutory authority, violate the APA, and violate the U.S. Constitution; \nb)  Enter a judgment declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 5 U.S.C. § 706, that: \n(i) the Final Rule’s gender-identity mandates are unlawful; (ii) the Final Rule is \narbitrary and capricious; and (iii) the Plaintiff States, their political subdivisions, and \ntheir resident healthcare providers may continue receiving federal financial assistance \nnotwithstanding any failure to adhere to the 2024 Rule’s unlawful requirements; \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 1   Filed 05/30/24   Page 79 of 83\nc)  Set aside and vacate the Final Rule, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706, on the basis that it \nexceeds HHS’s statutory authority and violates the APA and the U.S. Constitution; \nd)  Permanently  enjoin  Defendants  and  their  officers,  agents,  servants,  employees, \nattorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nDefendants from withholding federal financial assistance from the Plaintiff States, their \npolitical subdivisions, and their resident healthcare providers and health insurance \nissuers for refusing to comply with the Final Rule’s unlawful requirements; \ne)  Grant any and all other relief the Court deems just and proper. \n   Date: May 30, 2024.

But the text of the rule, not HHS counsel’s \nafter-the-fact rationalization, controls.  And the 2024 Rule expressly requires the steps—like dividing \nmedical spaces by gender identity rather than sex, providing controversial gender-transition interven-\ntions, and subsidizing the same with state funds—the States now challenge.  (If the 2024 Rule is not \nin fact that broad, HHS must clearly say so on remand with reasoning that satisfies the APA.)  HHS’s \neffort to sidestep the 2024 Rule’s plain terms—or to avoid merits review altogether—speaks volumes \nabout the rule’s lack of legal basis.  This Court should grant preliminary relief.         \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs can challenge the 2024 Rule now.   \nStanding.  Standing is “easy to establish” in this case.  Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic \nMed., 602 U.S. 367, 367 (2024).  That is because the “text of the [2024 Rule]” directly regulates the \nStates in their capacity as providers of medical care, facilities, and insurance plans.  Tennessee v. Dep’t of \nEduc., No. 22-5807, 2024 WL 2984295, at *5 (6th Cir. 2024).  The 2024 Rule “proscribes their con-\nduct” with new gender-identity mandates, which impose compliance costs and derogate state sover-\neignty.  W. Va. Ex rel. Morrisey v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1136-38 (11th Cir. 2023).  If \nnothing else, since HHS agrees (at 23) that Tennessee has standing, this Court can review the 2024 \nRule.  Gen. Land Off. v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264, 271 (5th Cir. 2023). \nImplied Preclusion.  Plaintiffs’ challenge is not reserved for agency proceedings.  See Tennessee, \n \n1 HHS, HHS Issues New Rule to Strengthen Nondiscrimination Protections and Advance Civil Rights in Health Care (Apr. 26, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/GRZ6-LAN7. \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 7 of 19\n2024 WL 2984295, *17-21; cf. Opp’n 21 n.14.  None of the “enforcement mechanisms” Section 1557 \nincorporates, 42 U.S.C. § 18116, contains “a special statutory scheme” that forecloses this Court’s \nreview of HHS rules under the APA, e.g., Louisiana v. EPA, No. 2:23-CV-00692, 2024 WL 250798, at \n*19 (W.D. La. 2024) (Title VI); Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, at *18 (Title IX).  To the contrary, the \nincorporated statutes specify that “agency action”—including rules—“shall be subject to such judicial \nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by such department or agency on \nother grounds.”  20 U.S.C. § 1683.  Directing that courts “shall” review rules as “provided by” the \nAPA is the opposite of a preclusive “special statutory review scheme.”  Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 \nU.S. 175, 185 (2023). \nNor does the Social Security Act (“SSA”) implicitly strip this Court of jurisdiction to review \nthe Rule’s new requirements for Medicaid contracts with managed-care organizations.  Opp’n 17-18 \n(invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1316(a), (e)).  The SSA provisions HHS relies on have nothing to do with re-\nviewing managed-care-plan contracts.  HHS’s contrary reading, moreover, “could foreclose all mean-\ningful judicial review,” Axon, 598 U.S. at 190, since a private managed-care entity would need to agree \nto a non-compliant contract with the States to provoke HHS retaliation.  And HHS’s authority to \nissue the challenged gender-identity mandates is “wholly collateral” to the agency process and has \n“nothing to do with the … matters” at issue in CMS’s reimbursement adjudications.  Id. at 193. \nRipeness.  HHS argues (at 7) that “judicial review” should wait until HHS determines that a \nparticular law or policy violates Section 1557 “and completion of … administrative procedures.”  But \nthat would “immunize nearly all agency rulemaking activities from the coverage” of the APA.  Abbott \nLabs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 147 (1967).  That is not the law, and Plaintiffs’ challenge is ripe.  The \nissues are “fit for judicial resolution,” id. at 153, and hinge on a core question of law:  Whether Section \n1557 incorporates Bostock’s reasoning to cover gender-identity discrimination.  The 2024 Rule further \nthreatens Plaintiffs with the loss of billions of dollars in federal funds.  See Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 8 of 19\nat *17 (holding States could pursue pre-enforcement challenge to agency action that risked loss of \nfunding).  Plaintiffs “need not assume such risks while waiting for [HHS] to drop the hammer.” Id. \nNeese v. Becerra.  The decision in Neese, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668 (N.D. Tex. 2022), does not cut off \nreview here.  First, Neese did not issue injunctive relief, id. at 684, so nothing in that case blocks HHS \nfrom enforcing the 2024 Rule against the States.  If HHS disagrees, then the 2024 Rule should be set \naside as arbitrarily ignoring a binding directive that it is unlawful.  Second, Neese addressed only HHS’s \n2021 guidance—not the 2024 Rule.  Third, there is little reason to believe that Neese’s certified class \nof physicians extends to the States.  It certainly does not include the States’ Medicaid, CHIP, or other \nstate-sponsored health plans.  Fourth, HHS’s promise to not apply “the challenged interpretation” of \nSection 1557 (the 2021 guidance) against Neese class members “pending appeal,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,574 \nn.118, is empty since its delayed enforcement does not necessarily permit delayed compliance.  HHS’s “vol-\nuntary cessation” of enforcement must be disregarded.  Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, at *5 n.8.   \nB.  The 2024 Rule is contrary to law and exceeds HHS’s statutory authority. \nContrary to Law.  Section 1557’s prohibition on sex discrimination does not encompass “gender \nidentity.”  PI Br. 11-12.  HHS makes no serious attempt to reconcile the male/female language in Title \nIX and the ACA with “gender identity” in the 2024 Rule.  Opp’n 7-10.  Instead, HHS relies on Bostock \nfor the proposition that sex discrimination equals gender-identity discrimination.  See id.  But Bostock \nneither says nor means that any statutory reference to “sex” likewise prohibits gender-identity discrim-\nination, see PI Br. 12-14, as a raft of courts have recently concluded.2   \nHHS’s reading makes a hash of Title IX, which throughout allows for different treatment of \nmales and females because of biological differences between the sexes, see Compl. ¶¶ 52-53, which are \nrelevant in education and medicine, but not employment, see Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 \n \n2 See, e.g., Tennessee v. Cardona, No. 2:24-cv-0072-DCR, 2024 WL 3019146, at *9-13 (E.D. Ky. 2024); Texas v. Cardona, No. \n4:23-cv-00604-O, 2024 WL 2947022, at *28 (N.D. Tex. 2024); Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:24-CV-00563-TAD, \n2024 WL 2978786, at *11 (W.D. La. 2024); see also Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 n.4 (6th Cir. 2021). \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 9 of 19\nF.4th 791, 814 n.7 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc).  Yet HHS (at 10) asks this Court to ignore the surround-\ning provisions and implementing regulations of Title IX and just pluck out the term “sex.”  But what \nconstitutes “discrimination” for purposes of Title IX (and thus Section 1557) is informed by the Act \nin its entirety.  Section 1557 thus uses “et seq.” when incorporating Title IX, which imports that \nSection 1557 incorporates all of Title IX.  PI Br. 14.  HHS offers no response.   \nHHS’s remaining attempts to square Bostock with Title IX and Section 1557 fail too.  HHS \ninsists (at 3, 10, 15) that covered entities may “operat[e] sex separated programs and facilities.”  At the \nsame time, the Final Rule makes clear that refusing to place a transgender person “in facilities con-\nsistent with their gender identity” is actionable discrimination per se.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,593.  This view \nrenders any allowance for sex-separation “meaningless.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 813.  A “sex-separation” \npolicy that must give way to patients’ gender-identity preferences does not “allow” sex-separation—\njust gender-identity-based separation.  Nor can HHS’s new de minimis harm standard change what \ndiscrimination entails: treatment of a person that is “worse than others who are similarly situated.”  Bostock \nv. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 657 (2020) (emphasis added).  A woman and a man who identifies as a \nwoman are not “similarly situated” for purposes of seeking certain medical treatments, like a vagi-\nnoplasty.  PI Br. 14-16.  The 2024 Rule’s failure to abide this blackletter tenet renders it unlawful.  \nExceeds Authority.  The 2024 Rule exceeds HHS’s authority by requiring doctors to provide and \ninsurers to cover gender-transition treatments.  PI Br. 17-19.  HHS counters (at 4) that “no § 1557 \nviolation occurs where the denial of a service [or coverage] is based on ‘a legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreason,’ and not ‘unlawful animus or bias’ or ‘pretext for discrimination.’”  So, HHS says (at 14), the \nStates are wrong to “presuppose” that the rule directs gender-identity related treatments or coverage.   \nHHS cannot so easily misdirect from what the 2024 Rule plainly requires.  The rule’s text \nmakes clear that a categorical refusal to provide or cover gender-transition treatments—as required by \nthe laws and health plans maintained by many of the Plaintiff States—is prohibited discrimination.  See, \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 10 of 19\ne.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701 (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.206(b)(4), 92.207(b)(4)-(5)) (illegal to \n“[d]eny or limit” services for gender transition “that the covered entity would provide for other pur-\nposes” or to maintain “categorial coverage exclusion” that “results in discrimination based on sex”).  \nHHS’s brief (at 12, 14) confirms this no-categorial-exclusion reading by stressing the need for “par-\nticular patient” determinations.  HHS’s touted revisions (at 12-13) thus accomplish the same result—\noutlawing providers and States from categorically denying treatment—through subtext.  Such a read-\ning not only aligns with the 2024 Rule’s continued directive that it will “preempt” contrary state law,  \nsee 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,535; it also reflects the recent litigation position of the Department of Justice, \nwhich has argued that “categorical exclusion[s] of gender-affirming care” violate Medicaid and Section \n1557.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-25 & 21 n.8, Dekker v. Sec’y, Fla. Agency for Health \nCare Admin., No. 23-12155 (11th Cir. Dec. 4, 2023).  Nor can health plans deny such procedures for \ncertain non-discriminatory reasons—like their being “experimental or cosmetic.”  NPRM, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 47,874.  HHS has already opined that such designations “would be considered evidence of \npretext” and “result in prohibited discrimination.”  Id.  HHS’s brief cannot walk back the 2024 Rule’s \nrequirements now.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).  \nHHS claims (at 17) that because it has rulemaking authority to implement the SSA, its Medi-\ncaid and CHIP rules must be lawful.  That is not how agency authority works.  HHS’s rulemaking \npower is instead constrained by limits Congress placed within the SSA.  See Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014).  For example, HHS must ensure that participants’ “methods of administra-\ntion” are “necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(4), and \nthat States “initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance … in an effective and efficient \nmanner,” id. § 1397aa(a).  But the 2024 Rule’s gender-identity mandates are not “methods of admin-\nistration,” nor are they means of ensuring “effective and efficient” provision of child health assistance.  \nPI Br. 19-20.  They are substantive mandates.  Congress would not have hidden the “elephant[]” of \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 11 of 19\nacross-the-board gender-identity mandates on States in the “mousehole[]” of Medicaid-program mi-\nnutiae.  Chamber of Com. v. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir. 2018).  And parties’ prior failure \nto challenge distinct HHS actions does not short circuit the States’ right to obtain review of HHS’s \nnovel gender-identity mandates through this timely challenge.  Cf. Opp’n 17.   \nC.  The 2024 Rule is contrary to the Spending Clause. \nThe 2024 Rule violates the Spending Clause by unveiling new, extra-statutory gender-identity \nconditions and unlawfully coercing States with billions of dollars in Medicaid funding.  PI Br. 20-22.   \nHHS’s proposed private-suit limit (at 18) on the clear-statement rule defies law and logic—\nand the case HHS cites observed that a spending-program grantee needs to know “what rules it must \nfollow,” not just “what sort of penalties might be on the table.”  Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, \nP.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 220 (2022).  Nor did Section 1557’s limit on “sex” discrimination generally \nput States on notice of HHS’s “gender-identity” rule specifically.  Cf. Opp’n 18-19.  HHS admits as \nmuch by repeating that “[t]he Rule … clarifies § 1557’s scope in light of Bostock.”  Id. at 19.  A provision \nthat “unambiguously condition[s] a federal grant” needs no clarifying.  Tex. Educ. Dep’t v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 992 F.3d 350, 360 (5th Cir. 2021).  Contra HHS (at 19), there is no nondiscrimination exception \nto the clear-statement rule.  The basis for discrimination must be “clear and actionable”—even if what \nactions qualify as discriminatory conduct on that basis requires case-by-case analysis.  See Benning v. \nGeorgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1306 (11th Cir. 2004).  Last, HHS casts off National Federation of Independent \nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), as “one-of-a-kind.”  Opp’n 20.  Maybe it was—but only until \nthe 2024 Rule again threatened billions in States’ Medicaid funding.  PI Br. 21-22.  Here, as in NFIB, \n“[t]he threatened loss” of the States’ Medicaid funding is unlawful “economic dragooning that leaves \nthe States with no real option.”  567 U.S. at 581 (plurality opinion).  These Spending Clause concerns \nunderscore the implausibility of HHS’s interpretation of Title IX and Section 1557.  See Inhance Techs., \nL.L.C. v. EPA, 96 F.4th 888, 893 (5th Cir. 2024) (discussing avoidance). \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 12 of 19\n  D.  The 2024 Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \n  HHS (at 20) continues to insist the Rule imposes no “standard of care” or “attempt to supplant \nthe medical judgment of healthcare professionals.”  The Rule’s plain text disagrees.  Supra at 4-5. \n  HHS’s insistence (at 20) that the Rule’s gender-identity mandates do not implicate WPATH’s \nso-called “standards of care” likewise rings hollow, given the agency’s reliance on those standards to \ndefine “gender transition or gender affirming care,” see NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,867 & n.416, and \nits citation to the same in explaining that “[g]ender-affirming care … should follow clinical practice \nguidelines and professional standards of care,” id. at 47,868 & n.423.   \nLike the Final Rule, HHS’s brief stays mum on the harmful and lifelong effects of gender-\ntransition treatments.  This silence is telling, but not surprising.  After all, discovery in a case involving \nAlabama’s restrictions on transitioning interventions for minors has revealed that HHS itself rushed \nWPATH to publish the latest version of its “standards” in 2022 in order to show “policy progress” \nfor the Biden Administration; HHS further urged WPATH to remove all recommended age mini-\nmums for transitioning treatments.  See Boe v. Marshall, 2:22-cv-184-LCB-CWB (M.D. Ala.), Doc. 619 \nat 19-20.  The APA required HHS to grapple with this contrary evidence, not ignore it.  PI Br. 22. \nII.  Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed Absent Injunctive Relief. \nStarting July 5, the 2024 Rule requires the States—as directly regulated parties—to come into \ncompliance with its gender-identity mandates.  To do so, States will need to expend unrecoverable \ncompliance costs altering policies, PI Br. 22, abandon enforcement of their own contrary laws and \nregulations that fall within HHS’s new definition of sex-based “discrimination,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,699 \n(to be codified at 45 C.F.R. § 92.101), and provide “assurances” of their compliance, id. at 37,696 (to \nbe codified at § 92.5).  Failure to do so risks the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding designed \nto help some of the States’ neediest citizens.  All of this is textbook irreparable harm.  PI Br. 23-25. \nHHS (at 22, 25) argues that any harm to the States is “speculative and not imminent” because \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 13 of 19\nthe States might be able “to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for any law or policy \nthat conflicts with the 2024 Rule during a future investigation or enforcement action.  Of course, the \n“upshot of winning this claim is that the States shouldn’t be subjected to administrative investigations \nor proceedings at all.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, at *20.  Regardless, the 2024 Rule makes the result \nof any future enforcement a foregone conclusion:  It sets a binding HHS mandate that Plaintiff States’ \nlaws prohibiting and categorical coverage exclusions for gender-transition services are unlawful.  See \nsupra at 4-5.  As discussed, the States “need not await enforcement proceedings before challenging \nfinal agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of ‘serious … civil penalties.’”  Tennessee, \n2024 WL 2984295, at *17 (citation omitted).  Because the Final Rule means States “will continue to \nface pressure to change their laws to avoid legal consequences,” it inflicts irreparable injury.  Id. at *25.   \nReality obliterates HHS’s assertion (at 27) that States would not incur any compliance costs \nuntil they are in the throes of an enforcement action.  Compliance with the 2024 Rule’s gender-identity \nmandates will require the States to expend significant, unrecoverable sums now.  See PI Br. 22-23.  The \n2024 Rule concedes the point.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,679-82.  The Rule’s “immediate effects on the States’ \nordering of their own affairs” is a “here-and-now injury.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, at *17 (quoting \nAxon, 598 U.S. at 191.  HHS’s counter (at 27 n. 20) that other provisions may impose additional costs \nin the form of updating policies or providing training does not erase the harm from the gender-identity \nmandates.  HHS’s view would shield any manner of unlawful regulations from challenge so long as \npackaged alongside a few benign provisions.  But “complying with a regulation later held invalid al-\nmost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”  Texas v. EPA, 829 \nF.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (emphasis in original).   \nHHS (at 27) denies that States’ health plans would incur increased coverage costs because the \nRule purportedly does not endorse or impose any “standard of care” for gender transition.  But again, \nthat contradicts the Rule’s plain text, which prohibits the very “categorical coverage exclusions” for \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 14 of 19\ngender-transition services featured in many of the Plaintiffs’ health plans.  Supra at 4-5.  Saying that \nStates cannot maintain exclusions for gender-transition procedures and that States must cover them \nis the flip side of the same coin.  Indeed, that is a key holding of Section 1557 cases on which HHS \nrelies.  E.g., Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, 135-39, 164 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc) (cited at Opp’n 9, 12).   \n  HHS’s assertion (at 23) that only Tennessee has standing to challenge the 2024 Rule’s man-\ndates on “healthcare providers” gets it nowhere, since “only one [State] needs standing for the action \nto proceed.”  Gen. Land Off., 71 F.4th at 271.  In any event, HHS ignores the sovereign harm to all \nPlaintiff States from the 2024 Rule’s stripping them of their traditional authority to establish and en-\nforce their own laws regulating the practice of medicine within their borders.  See Texas, 2024 WL \n2947022 at *49.  Section 92.206 would require doctors to provide gender-transition services in viola-\ntion of laws adopted by most all the Plaintiff States.  Compl. ¶¶ 107-36.  The 2024 Rule’s overriding \nof “statutes enacted by representatives of [the States’] people” inflicts a quintessential “irreparable \ninjury” on States’ sovereignty.  Vote.org v. Callanen, 39 F.4th 297, 308 (5th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).   \nHHS’s last assertion (at 28) that the States “cannot invoke the health and welfare of their \ncitizens” overlooks the States’ “quasi-sovereign interest in the ‘health and well-being … of [their] \nresidents in general.’”  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 599 (6th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).  That \ninterest encompasses safeguarding children from treatments for which there is “uncertainty regarding \nbenefits, recent surges in use, and irreversible effects,” Eknes-Tucker v. Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205, 1225 \n(11th Cir. 2023), and “protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession,” Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 153 (5th Cir. 2015). \nII.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Both Favor Preliminary Relief. \n  The public interest overwhelmingly favors temporarily staying the status quo pending judicial \nreview.  PI Br. 25.  HHS (at 28) insists there is “significant public interest in permitting enforcement \nof the Rule to combat discrimination” by covered entities.  But “the public’s true interest lies in the \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 15 of 19\ncorrect application of the law.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 2984295 at *26.  And the States have shown that \nthe 2024 Rule’s conception of discrimination is unlawful.  The public interest likewise favors address-\ning difficult gender-identity issues through “[e]lected representatives” and state-and-local policy, L.W. \nv. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 491 (6th Cir. 2023), not through an agency-made mandate.  That is particularly \nso when what is at stake are unproven gender interventions with life-long effects.

The APA and Equity Support Entry of the Preliminary Relief Sought. \n  Section 705 of the APA authorizes a reviewing court to “issue all necessary and appropriate \nprocess to postpone the effective date of an agency action” that is pending review.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  \nAnd HHS’s relief argument (at 30) supports enjoining all of the 2024 Rule’s gender-identity mandates, \nwhich the Plaintiff States “actually challenge.” PI Br. 2.  HHS is wrong to suggest Plaintiffs’ argument \nimplicates only § 92.101(a)(2)(iv)—i.e., the provision defining sex discrimination to include gender-\nidentity discrimination.  Rather, gender-identity mandates appear throughout the 2024 Rule.  For ex-\nample, proposed § 92.206 never references § 92.101, yet prohibits doctors from refusing to provide \ngender-transition services if they provide similar treatments “for other purposes.”  Likewise, § 92.207 \nitself prohibits a “categorical coverage exclusion” for gender-transition services in covered health \nplans.  HHS’s gender-identity mandates are embedded in other provisions, too—including the 2024 \nRule’s requirements regarding assurances of compliance, remedial actions, coordinator investigations, \nthe revision of policies and procedures, and training.  Principles of equity counsel in favor of issuing \ntemporary relief from the Rule’s challenged provisions to avoid States and providers’ needing to parse \nthrough piecemeal provisions and engage in multiple rounds of costly compliance activities. That relief \nshould have the breadth appropriate to avoid any harm the Rule may improperly inflict.  Cf. Career \nColls. & Sch. of Tex. v. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024).    \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant Plaintiff States’ motion for a § 705 stay and a preliminary injunction. \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 26   Filed 07/01/24   Page 16 of 19\nDate: July 1, 2024.

DEFENDANTS \n \nORDER TAKING UNDER ADVISEMENT PLAINTIFFS’  \nMOTION FOR ENTRY OF BRIEFING SCHEDULE  \nAND REQUIRING BRIEFS FROM THE PARTIES \n \n  BEFORE THE COURT is the [32] Motion for Entry of Briefing Schedule \nfiled by Plaintiffs in this lawsuit challenging a final rule issued by the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services on May 6, 2024.  See \nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 89 Fed. Reg. 37,522 (May 6, \n2024) (45 C.F.R. pt. 92).   \n  On July 3, 2024, the Court issued a Preliminary Injunction staying the \neffective date of the Rule nationwide in so far as it is “intended to extend \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex to include discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity in the following regulations: 42 C.F.R. §§ 438.3, 438.206, 440.262, 460.98, \n460.112; 45 C.F.R. §§ 92.5, 92.6, 92.7, 92.8, 92.9, 92.10, 92.101, 92.206-211, 92.301, \n92.303, 92.304.”  [30 p. 1].  The Court further enjoined Defendants nationwide “from \nenforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant to the final rule . \n. . to the extent that [it] provides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses gender \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 44   Filed 09/25/24   Page 2 of 2\nidentity.”  Id. at 1–2.  Defendants opposed Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Briefing Schedule, \nand they filed a [42] Notice of Appeal concerning the Preliminary Injunction on \nAugust 30, 2024.   \n  The Fifth Circuit has explained: \nIt is the general rule that a district court is divested of jurisdiction \nupon the filing of the notice of appeal with respect to any matters \ninvolved in the appeal.  However, where an appeal is allowed from an \ninterlocutory order, the district court may still proceed with matters \nnot involved in the appeal. \n \nAlice L. v. Dusek, 492 F.3d 563, 564–65 (5th Cir. 2007).  As a result, the parties are \nordered to submit briefs to the Court concerning whether any part of this case can \nproceed while the appeal of the Court’s [30] Preliminary Injunction is pending. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the [32] Motion \nfor Entry of Briefing Schedule filed by Plaintiffs is TAKEN UNDER \nADVISEMENT. \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that, on or before \nOctober 2, 2024, the parties shall provide the Court with briefs concerning \nwhether any part of this litigation can proceed while the appeal of the Court’s \nPreliminary Injunction is pending. \n  SO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this the 25th day of September, 2024. \n Louis Guirola, Jr.\n              s/  \n              LOUIS GUIROLA, JR. \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n   \n-2- \n ",

      "text": "Case 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 1 of 7\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n   \nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.  No. 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR \n   \nXAVIER BECERRA, in his official capacity   \nas Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human \nServices, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court stay further district court proceedings in this \ncase until Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction is finally resolved.  See Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 42.  As courts of appeals have long \nrecognized, a stay of district court proceedings “to await a federal appellate decision that is likely \nto have a substantial or controlling effect on the claims and issues in the stayed case” is “at least a \ngood, if not an excellent” reason to stay proceedings.  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. S. \nFla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 559 F.3d 1191, 1198 (11th Cir. 2009).  Indeed, such a stay would not \nprejudice Plaintiffs here, as they are already protected by the preliminary injunction and stay order \nissued by this Court, ECF No. 30 (“PI Order”), as well as similar orders issued by district courts \nin Texas.  See, e.g., Order Modifying Stay, Texas v. Becerra, No. 6:24-cv-211 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 30, \n2024), ECF No. 41 (stay order applying to covered entities nationwide); Final Judgment, Neese v. \nBecerra, No. 2:21-cv-00163-Z (N.D. Tex. Nov. 22, 2022), ECF No. 71 (declaratory judgment \napplying to a class of all healthcare providers subject to Section 1557 nationwide).  A stay would \nalso conserve resources of the Court and the parties and minimize the risk of conflicting decisions.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 2 of 7\nDefendants have conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel about this stay request, and Plaintiffs \noppose such relief.  Should the Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, Defendants respectfully \nask, in the alternative, for an extension of time to respond to the Complaint until 14 days after any \nsuch denial.1   \nBACKGROUND \nOn May 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action challenging the validity of \nportions of a rule (the “2024 Rule”) promulgated by the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”) to implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.  ECF No. 1.  \nPlaintiffs then moved for a § 705 stay and a preliminary injunction two weeks later, ECF No. 20, \nand Defendants opposed that motion on the basis that Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits or establish irreparable harm, ECF No. 24.  On July 3, 2024, this Court issued its PI Order, \nwhich stayed nationwide the effective date of specified provisions of the 2024 Rule and enjoined \nDefendants “nationwide from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant \nto the [2024 Rule] to the extent that the final rule provides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses \ngender identity.”  ECF No. 30 at 2. \nSince that PI Order, Plaintiffs have moved for a briefing schedule on dispositive motions, \nECF No. 32, which Defendants have opposed, ECF No. 40, and the Court granted Defendants’ \nfirst request for an extension of time to file a response to the Complaint, extending the deadline to \nSeptember 30, 2024.  On August 30, 2024, Defendants appealed this Court’s PI Order to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  ECF No. 42.   \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case until Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order to the Fifth Circuit is finally resolved, as all three traditional stay factors \nweigh in favor of a stay.  Alternatively, should the Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, \n \n1 As of this filing, Defendants have received notice of the Court’s most recent order, which requests briefing on \n“whether any part of this case can proceed while the appeal of the Court’s [30] Preliminary Injunction is pending.”  \nECF No. 44 at 2.  Defendants intend to address that separate question in a separate filing by the Court’s deadline of \nOctober 2, 2024.  See id. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 3 of 7\nDefendants respectfully seek an extension of time to respond to the Complaint until 14 days after \nany such denial. \nI.  The Traditional Stay Factors Justify a Stay. \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case pending Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order because a ruling by the appellate court is likely to provide substantial, if not \ndispositive, guidance to the Court and the parties in resolving the merits issues presented here.  \nMoreover, a stay will not prejudice Plaintiffs because they are protected by the nationwide stay \nand injunction issued by this Court. \nWhen determining whether to grant a stay, courts generally consider whether (1) the stay \nwould prejudice the non-moving party, (2) the proponent of the stay would suffer hardship or \ninequity if forced to proceed, and (3) granting the stay would further judicial economy.  Arch Ins. \nCo. v. Clark Constr., Inc., No. 5:22-cv-100-KS-BWR, 2023 WL 2762025, at *1 (S.D. Miss Apr. \n3, 2023).  Weighing these factors confirms that a stay is warranted here.   \nAs an initial matter, a stay of district court proceedings—including a stay of any proposed \nsummary judgment briefing—will not prejudice Plaintiffs because this Court has already issued a \nruling which, among other things, enjoins Defendants “nationwide from enforcing, relying on, \nimplementing, or otherwise acting pursuant to the [2024 Rule] to the extent that the final rule \nprovides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses gender identity.”  ECF No. 30 at 2.  In other words, \nDefendants’ proposed stay would not impose any hardship or inequity upon Plaintiffs because it \nwould merely preserve the status quo until the Fifth Circuit weighs in on potentially dispositive \nquestions of law to be raised in Defendants’ appeal.  See, e.g., Latta v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 653 F. \nSupp. 3d 435, 440–41 (S.D. Ohio 2023) (no prejudice to Plaintiff from stay because challenged \nprogram “is currently enjoined”); Electronic Order, Walker v. Azar, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS \n(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020) (granting stay pending appeal of preliminary injunction and finding that \nthe “possibility of further irreparable harm to the plaintiffs pending appeal is mitigated by the \nextant preliminary injunction”); Washington v. Trump, No. C17-0141JLR, 2017 WL 1050354, at \n*4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 17, 2017) (finding that any prejudice to plaintiffs from stay would be \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 4 of 7\n“minimal—if there is any at all” in light of the preliminary injunctive relief already in effect); \nHawaii v. Trump, 233 F. Supp. 3d 850, 853–54 (D. Haw. 2017) (same); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood \nGrp., No. 1:15-108-CL, 2015 WL 13744253, at *2 (D. Or. Aug. 6, 2015) (same); see also \nWhitman-Walker Clinic v. HHS, No. 20-1650 (JEB), 2021 WL 4033072, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, \n2021) (finding that prejudice to plaintiffs from a stay of proceedings was minimal where the \nprovisions of the Rule “that form the heart of Plaintiffs’ objections are currently—and will \nremain—enjoined”). \nBy contrast, requiring Defendants to litigate this action further in district court before the \nFifth Circuit weighs in on overlapping if not dispositive questions of law would likely prove to be \na wasteful exercise.  See, e.g., Whitman-Walker, 2021 WL 4033072, at *3 (“In the interim, a \nsubstantial amount of the parties’ and the Court’s resources would have been expended and \npotentially for little gain.”).  “[I]t makes no sense” for the same parties to litigate overlapping if \nnot identical legal issues before this Court and the Fifth Circuit.  See United States v. Abbott, 92 \nF.4th 570, 571 (5th Cir. 2024) (Mem.) (Jones, J., concurring).  See also McGregory v. 21st Century \nIns. & Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 1:15-CV-00098-DMB-DAS, 2016 WL 11643678, at *3 (N.D. Miss. \nFeb. 2, 2016) (possibility of defendant expending substantial resources in litigation only for \nappellate decision to resolve issue “weighs in favor of a stay”).  Put simply, a Fifth Circuit ruling \non appeal of the Court’s PI Order could prove fully or partially dispositive of the issues in this \ncase, and, at the very least, “will have a significant impact on the litigation going forward.”  See \nElectronic Order, Walker, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020); Lincoln Gen. \nIns. Comp. v. Autobuses Tierra Caliente, Inc., No. 3:04-CV-1535-L, 2006 WL 2474096, at *2 \n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 28, 2006) (“judicially prudent to stay this action until the Fifth Circuit rules” \nwhen “the pertinent issues in this case are also the issues before the Fifth Circuit”).  Defendants \nsee no reason why the same parties should exhaust resources to fight the same legal battles in \noverlapping legal forums. \nFor similar reasons, there are obvious benefits to judicial economy in awaiting further \nguidance from the Fifth Circuit.  See Order, Jordan v. Hall, No. 3:15-cv-00295-HTW-LGI (S.D. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 5 of 7\nMiss. July 27, 2018), ECF No. 175 (holding “that it would not be an effective use of judicial \nresources to try this case” before further appellate guidance); Boyd v. Am. Heritage Ins. Co., 282 \nF.

Miss. 2003) (“If this Court follows the reasoning in [a case on appeal] \nand that case is later vacated . . . , then both this Court and the parties will have wasted valuable \ntime and resources.”).  As noted above, a Fifth Circuit ruling on Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s \nPI Order may prove dispositive, and, at the very least, provide guidance on relevant legal issues \nand facilitate further proceedings in this case.  See, e.g., Coker v. Select Energy Servs., 161 F. \nSupp. 3d 492, 495 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (“interest in judicial economy favors a stay because [litigation \nresources] may be needlessly incurred if the Fifth Circuit and/or Supreme Court rules” on pending \nissues).  And as one district court within this circuit explained: “How the Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit answers the significant legal questions of this case will likely alter upcoming \nproceedings.  Thus, staying this case avoids duplicative and potentially unnecessary litigation, \nconserving judicial resources.”  Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Case No. A-16-CA-1300-\nSS, 2017 WL 5649477, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2017).  See also Order at 2, Leachco, Inc. v. \nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, No. CIV-22-232-RAW (E.D. Okla. Dec. 8, 2022), ECF No. 58 \n(appeal of preliminary injunction decision “may implicate the same issues that will be addressed \nhere in future proceedings, and a stay would avoid potentially duplicative briefing and conserve \nthe resources of both the parties and the court”); Bahl v. N.Y. Coll. of Osteopathic Med. of N.Y. \nInst. of Tech., No. CV 14-4020, 2018 WL 4861390, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (finding that \na stay will serve the court’s interests because it will “minimize the possibility of conflicts between \ndifferent courts”) (citing cases).   \nFinally, Defendants note that this Court has recently denied a motion to stay district court \nproceedings in a separate case.  Order Denying Motion to Stay Proceedings, McComb v. Becerra \net al., No. 5:24CV48-LG-ASH (S.D. Miss. Sept. 18, 2024), ECF No. 34.  While Defendants \nrespectfully disagree with that ruling, it ultimately has no bearing on whether a stay is warranted \nhere.  Unlike the McComb plaintiff, the Plaintiffs here represent the same parties that will be \nlitigating potentially dispositive questions of law before the Fifth Circuit on appeal.  In other \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 45   Filed 09/25/24   Page 6 of 7\nwords, the apparent concerns this Court had in that case—that the McComb plaintiff would be \n“compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the \nrights of both”—is absent here.  Id. \nAccordingly, because all three factors weigh in favor of a stay, the Court should stay further \ndistrict court proceedings in this case until the appeal of the Court’s PI Order is finally resolved. \nII.  In the Alternative, the Court Should Extend the Deadline to Respond to the \nComplaint. \nAlternatively, if the Court decides to deny a stay of proceedings, Defendants respectfully \nrequest  an  extension  of  the  current  September  30,  2024  deadline  to  respond  to  Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint until 14 days after any such denial.  Good cause supports the requested extension.  Such \nan extension would allow Defendants to obtain a Court ruling on their request for a stay, which \nDefendants have sought in good faith and which, in their view, is supported by good cause and the \ninterests of judicial and party economy.  Defendants further submit that 14 days is a reasonable \namount of additional time to respond to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which asserts 5 claims and is 79 \npages and 290 paragraphs long.  Defendants have requested only one prior extension of time to \nrespond to the Complaint, which was granted. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court stay further \ndistrict court proceedings in this case until Defendants’ appeal from this Court’s PI Order is finally \nresolved.

      "text": "Case 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 47   Filed 09/27/24   Page 1 of 7\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n   \nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.  No. 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR \n   \nXAVIER BECERRA, in his official capacity   \nas Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human \nServices, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF  \nDEFENDANTS’ AMENDED MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court stay further district court proceedings in this \ncase until Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction is finally resolved.  See Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 42.  As courts of appeals have long \nrecognized, a stay of district court proceedings “to await a federal appellate decision that is likely \nto have a substantial or controlling effect on the claims and issues in the stayed case” is “at least a \ngood, if not an excellent” reason to stay proceedings.  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. S. \nFla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 559 F.3d 1191, 1198 (11th Cir. 2009).  Indeed, such a stay would not \nprejudice Plaintiffs here, as they are already protected by the preliminary injunction and stay order \nissued by this Court, ECF No. 30 (“PI Order”), as well as similar orders issued by district courts \nin Texas.  See, e.g., Order Modifying Stay, Texas v. Becerra, No. 6:24-cv-211 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 30, \n2024), ECF No. 41 (stay order applying to covered entities nationwide); Final Judgment, Neese v. \nBecerra, No. 2:21-cv-00163-Z (N.D. Tex. Nov. 22, 2022), ECF No. 71 (declaratory judgment \napplying to a class of all healthcare providers subject to Section 1557 nationwide).  A stay would \nalso conserve resources of the Court and the parties and minimize the risk of conflicting decisions.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 47   Filed 09/27/24   Page 2 of 7\nDefendants have conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel about this stay request, and Plaintiffs \noppose such relief.  Should the Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, Defendants respectfully \nask, in the alternative, for an extension of time to respond to the Complaint until 14 days after any \nsuch denial.1   \nBACKGROUND \nOn May 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action challenging the validity of \nportions of a rule (the “2024 Rule”) promulgated by the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”) to implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.  ECF No. 1.  \nPlaintiffs then moved for a § 705 stay and a preliminary injunction two weeks later, ECF No. 20, \nand Defendants opposed that motion on the basis that Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits or establish irreparable harm, ECF No. 24.  On July 3, 2024, this Court issued its PI Order, \nwhich stayed nationwide the effective date of specified provisions of the 2024 Rule and enjoined \nDefendants “nationwide from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant \nto the [2024 Rule] to the extent that the final rule provides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses \ngender identity.”  ECF No. 30 at 2. \nSince that PI Order, Plaintiffs have moved for a briefing schedule on dispositive motions, \nECF No. 32, which Defendants have opposed, ECF No. 40, and the Court granted Defendants’ \nfirst request for an extension of time to file a response to the Complaint, extending the deadline to \nSeptember 30, 2024.  On August 30, 2024, Defendants appealed this Court’s PI Order to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  ECF No. 42.   \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case until Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order to the Fifth Circuit is finally resolved, as all three traditional stay factors \nweigh in favor of a stay.  Alternatively, should the Court deny Defendants’ request for a stay, \n \n1 As of this filing, Defendants have received notice of the Court’s order, which requests briefing on “whether any part \nof this case can proceed while the appeal of the Court’s [30] Preliminary Injunction is pending.”  ECF No. 44 at 2.  \nDefendants intend to address that separate question in a separate filing by the Court’s deadline of October 2, 2024.  \nSee id. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 47   Filed 09/27/24   Page 3 of 7\nDefendants respectfully seek an extension of time to respond to the Complaint until 14 days after \nany such denial. \nI.  The Traditional Stay Factors Justify a Stay. \nThe Court should stay further district court proceedings in this case pending Defendants’ \nappeal of the PI Order because a ruling by the appellate court is likely to provide substantial, if not \ndispositive, guidance to the Court and the parties in resolving the merits issues presented here.  \nMoreover, a stay will not prejudice Plaintiffs because they are protected by the nationwide stay \nand injunction issued by this Court. \nWhen determining whether to grant a stay, courts generally consider whether (1) the stay \nwould prejudice the non-moving party, (2) the proponent of the stay would suffer hardship or \ninequity if forced to proceed, and (3) granting the stay would further judicial economy.  Arch Ins. \nCo. v. Clark Constr., Inc., No. 5:22-cv-100-KS-BWR, 2023 WL 2762025, at *1 (S.D. Miss Apr. \n3, 2023).  Weighing these factors confirms that a stay is warranted here.   \nAs an initial matter, a stay of district court proceedings—including a stay of any proposed \nsummary judgment briefing—will not prejudice Plaintiffs because this Court has already issued a \nruling which, among other things, enjoins Defendants “nationwide from enforcing, relying on, \nimplementing, or otherwise acting pursuant to the [2024 Rule] to the extent that the final rule \nprovides that ‘sex’ discrimination encompasses gender identity.”  ECF No. 30 at 2.  In other words, \nDefendants’ proposed stay would not impose any hardship or inequity upon Plaintiffs because it \nwould merely preserve the status quo until the Fifth Circuit weighs in on potentially dispositive \nquestions of law to be raised in Defendants’ appeal.  See, e.g., Latta v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 653 F. \nSupp. 3d 435, 440–41 (S.D. Ohio 2023) (no prejudice to Plaintiff from stay because challenged \nprogram “is currently enjoined”); Electronic Order, Walker v. Azar, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS \n(E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020) (granting stay pending appeal of preliminary injunction and finding that \nthe “possibility of further irreparable harm to the plaintiffs pending appeal is mitigated by the \nextant preliminary injunction”); Washington v. Trump, No. C17-0141JLR, 2017 WL 1050354, at \n*4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 17, 2017) (finding that any prejudice to plaintiffs from stay would be \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 47   Filed 09/27/24   Page 4 of 7\n“minimal—if there is any at all” in light of the preliminary injunctive relief already in effect); \nHawaii v. Trump, 233 F. Supp. 3d 850, 853–54 (D. Haw. 2017) (same); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood \nGrp., No. 1:15-108-CL, 2015 WL 13744253, at *2 (D. Or. Aug. 6, 2015) (same); see also \nWhitman-Walker Clinic v. HHS, No. 20-1650 (JEB), 2021 WL 4033072, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, \n2021) (finding that prejudice to plaintiffs from a stay of proceedings was minimal where the \nprovisions of the Rule “that form the heart of Plaintiffs’ objections are currently—and will \nremain—enjoined”). \nBy contrast, requiring Defendants to litigate this action further in district court before the \nFifth Circuit weighs in on overlapping if not dispositive questions of law would likely prove to be \na wasteful exercise.  See, e.g., Whitman-Walker, 2021 WL 4033072, at *3 (“In the interim, a \nsubstantial amount of the parties’ and the Court’s resources would have been expended and \npotentially for little gain.”).  “[I]t makes no sense” for the same parties to litigate overlapping if \nnot identical legal issues before this Court and the Fifth Circuit.  See United States v. Abbott, 92 \nF.4th 570, 571 (5th Cir. 2024) (Mem.) (Jones, J., concurring).  See also McGregory v. 21st Century \nIns. & Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 1:15-CV-00098-DMB-DAS, 2016 WL 11643678, at *3 (N.D. Miss. \nFeb. 2, 2016) (possibility of defendant expending substantial resources in litigation only for \nappellate decision to resolve issue “weighs in favor of a stay”).  Put simply, a Fifth Circuit ruling \non appeal of the Court’s PI Order could prove fully or partially dispositive of the issues in this \ncase, and, at the very least, “will have a significant impact on the litigation going forward.”  See \nElectronic Order, Walker, No. 1:20-cv-02834-FB-VMS (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2020); Lincoln Gen. \nIns. Comp. v. Autobuses Tierra Caliente, Inc., No. 3:04-CV-1535-L, 2006 WL 2474096, at *2 \n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 28, 2006) (“judicially prudent to stay this action until the Fifth Circuit rules” \nwhen “the pertinent issues in this case are also the issues before the Fifth Circuit”).  Defendants \nsee no reason why the same parties should exhaust resources to fight the same legal battles in \noverlapping legal forums. \nFor similar reasons, there are obvious benefits to judicial economy in awaiting further \nguidance from the Fifth Circuit.  See Order, Jordan v. Hall, No. 3:15-cv-00295-HTW-LGI (S.D. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 47   Filed 09/27/24   Page 5 of 7\nMiss. July 27, 2018), ECF No. 175 (holding “that it would not be an effective use of judicial \nresources to try this case” before further appellate guidance); Boyd v. Am. Heritage Ins. Co., 282 \nF. Supp. 2d 502, 503 (S.D. Miss. 2003) (“If this Court follows the reasoning in [a case on appeal] \nand that case is later vacated . . . , then both this Court and the parties will have wasted valuable \ntime and resources.”).  As noted above, a Fifth Circuit ruling on Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s \nPI Order may prove dispositive, and, at the very least, provide guidance on relevant legal issues \nand facilitate further proceedings in this case.  See, e.g., Coker v. Select Energy Servs., 161 F. \nSupp. 3d 492, 495 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (“interest in judicial economy favors a stay because [litigation \nresources] may be needlessly incurred if the Fifth Circuit and/or Supreme Court rules” on pending \nissues).  And as one district court within this circuit explained: “How the Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit answers the significant legal questions of this case will likely alter upcoming \nproceedings.  Thus, staying this case avoids duplicative and potentially unnecessary litigation, \nconserving judicial resources.”  Whole Woman’s Health v.

N.Y. Coll. of Osteopathic Med. of N.Y. \nInst. of Tech., No. CV 14-4020, 2018 WL 4861390, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (finding that \na stay will serve the court’s interests because it will “minimize the possibility of conflicts between \ndifferent courts”) (citing cases).   \nFinally, Defendants note that this Court has recently denied a motion to stay district court \nproceedings in a separate case.

See HHS, Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 89 Fed. Reg. 37,522 (May \n6, 2024) (“2024 Rule”).  As explained in Plaintiffs’ Complaint [ECF 1] and in the accompanying \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 20   Filed 06/13/24   Page 2 of 7\nmemorandum, HHS’s 2024 Rule—set to take effect July 5, 2024—is contrary to law, beyond the \nagency’s statutory authority, unconstitutional, and violates the Administrative Procedure Act. \nThe Plaintiff States bring this motion to seek preliminary relief from the unlawful 2024 Rule \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 705, which allows courts to stay the effective date of a challenged rule pending judicial \nreview, as well as under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  Without preliminary relief, the 2024 Rule \nwill impose unrecoverable compliance costs, interfere with States’ longstanding authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine within their borders, require compliance with regulations that conflict with \nStates’ duly enacted laws protecting vulnerable citizens from risky and unproven medical interven-\ntions, and force States to subsidize those costly interventions through their state-sponsored insurance \nplans.  If a State or healthcare provider balks at HHS’s gender-identity agenda, they risk losing all \nfederal funding.  For the States, that could amount to a loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for \nsome of their most vulnerable citizens.  Both the balance of the equities and the public interest also \nfavor temporarily maintaining the status quo pending judicial review of the 2024 Rule. \nAccordingly, the Plaintiff States request the entry of an order: \na.  Declaring the 2024 Rule’s redefinition of sex discrimination likely unlawful under \nSection 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and \nthe U.S. Constitution; \n \nb.  Staying the effective date of the 2024 Rule, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, as it pertains \nto the provisions set forth at 42 C.F.R. §§ 438.3, 438.206, 440.262, 460.98, 460.112; \n45 C.F.R. §§ 92.5, 92.6, 92.7, 92.8, 92.9, 92.10, 92.101, 92.206-211, 92.301, 92.303, \n92.304; and any other provision of the 2024 Rule applied with respect to “sex” \ndiscrimination that encompasses gender identity; \n \nc.  Preliminarily enjoining HHS, and any other agency or employee of the United \nStates, from enforcing, relying on, implementing, or otherwise acting pursuant to \nthe 2024 Rule’s challenged provisions; and \n \nd.  Granting any and all other preliminary relief the Court deems proper. \n \n  In support of the instant motion, the Plaintiff States rely on their Complaint [ECF 1], the \naccompanying memorandum of law, and the following exhibits attached hereto: \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 20   Filed 06/13/24   Page 3 of 7\nExhibit A – Declaration of Stephen Smith (Tennessee); \nExhibit B – Declaration of Cody Smith (Mississippi); \nExhibit C – Declaration of Kimberly Sullivan (Louisiana); \nExhibit D – Declaration of Jeremy Brunssen (Nebraska); \nExhibit E – Declaration of Cheryl Roberts (Virginia); and \nExhibit F – Declaration of Steven Voigt (Ohio); \nExhibit G – Declaration of Robert Kerr (South Carolina); \nExhibit H – Declaration of Wanda Davis (Alabama);  \nExhibit I – Declaration of Michael Althoff (South Dakota); and \nExhibit J – Declaration of Stephanie Azar (Alabama). \n  Given the 2024 Rule’s effective date of July 5, 2024, the Plaintiff States respectfully request \nexpedited consideration of their motion pursuant to Local Rule 7(b)(8).  The Plaintiff States would \npropose the following briefing schedule, which would align the preliminary-motions schedule in this \ncase with that of a related case pending before this Court, McComb Children’s Clinic, Ltd. v. Becerra, Civil \nAction No. 5:24-cv-48: \n•  June 13, 2024  Plaintiff States’ Motion for § 705 Stay and Preliminary  \nInjunction Filed \n \n•  June 24, 2024  Defendants’ Response Due \n \n•  June 26, 2024  Plaintiff States’ Reply Brief Due \nCounsel for the Plaintiff States has conferred with Counsel for the Defendants, Sarah M. Su-\nwanda, who represented that the Defendants oppose this Motion and expedited consideration of the \nsame.  The Plaintiff States further requested that Defendants agree to a temporary stay of any enforce-\nment of the 2024 Rule against the Plaintiff States until the end of July to provide additional time for \nbriefing of the instant motion, but Defendants object to any such stay. \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 20   Filed 06/13/24   Page 4 of 7\n \n \n \nDated: June 13, 2024                      Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nLYNN FITCH  JONATHAN SKRMETTI \n  Attorney General  Attorney General & Reporter \n \n/s/ Scott G.

In recent years, the De-\npartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has twice tried to extend that prohibition to en-\ncompass gender identity.  Courts ruled both attempts unlawful.  Hoping the third time is the charm, \nHHS issued a new rule that (again) interprets Section 1557 to include several gender-identity mandates.  \n89 Fed. Reg. 37,522 (May 6, 2024) (“2024 Rule”).  But this rule is as legally flawed as its predecessors, \nand then some.  The States now seek preliminary relief to prevent the significant and irreparable fallout \nfrom HHS’s unlawful power grab. \nThe States satisfy the factors for preliminary relief.  The States are likely to succeed on the \nmerits because the 2024 Rule is plainly unlawful.  Neither Section 1557 nor Title IX’s protection for \n“sex” confers protections for gender identity, period—let alone in the unprecedented manner the \n2024 Rule suggests.  Nor do those statutes allow HHS to usurp the States’ role as the primary regulator \nof medicine by saddling States and medical providers with an obligation to permit and provide risky \ntreatments against the weight of medical evidence and judgment.  At minimum, HHS’s new mandates \ncannot pass Spending Clause muster, since the ACA does not unambiguously authorize HHS’s new \ngender-identity mandates and cannot constitutionally coerce States’ compliance by threatening to \nwithhold significant portions of their budgets.  And HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by, among \nother things, failing to adequately consider the extent to which its gender-affirming-care mandates \nundermine the provision of sound medical treatment.   \nThe irreparable-harm implications of HHS’s 2024 Rule are staggering.  The Rule will inflict \nunrecoverable compliance costs and unlawful displacement of the States’ duly enacted laws protecting \nchildren.  The rule overrides the States’ regulation of medical care—a core sovereign function.  It \nprohibits healthcare facilities from maintaining sex-segregated spaces.  It requires healthcare providers \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 9 of 36\nto engage in unproven and risky treatments for gender dysphoria, even if the treatment is against their \nbest medical judgment.  It forces States and other insurers to subsidize experimental procedures.  And \nif a State or healthcare provider balks at HHS’s gender-identity agenda, they risk losing all federal \nfunding.  For the States, the funding loss could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. \nThe equities and public interest likewise favor temporarily maintaining the status quo pending \nreview of HHS’s Rule.  HHS cannot credibly claim a need to rush through a mandate based on argu-\nments courts have twice rejected as legally unsound.  If anything, the balance of equities favors per-\nmitting Plaintiff States to continue enforcing laws that protect vulnerable citizens from risky medical \nprocedures that can inflict life-long harms, including infertility, loss of sexual function, and increased \nrisks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.  This Court should grant preliminary relief. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Affordable Care Act Prohibits Sex Discrimination. \nIn 2010, Congress enacted the ACA.  That law includes a nondiscrimination provision, com-\nmonly referred to as Section 1557, that prohibits discrimination in “any health program or activity, \nany part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a).  Rather than cre-\nating any new bases of unlawful discrimination, “Congress incorporated [into Section 1557] the legal \nstandards that define discrimination under” existing federal laws.  Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., \nInc., 926 F.3d 235, 238 (6th Cir. 2019).  For sex discrimination, Section 1557 cross-references the \nprovisions of Title IX.  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (prohibiting discrimination \n“on the basis of sex” in education context).  No other provision in the ACA bars sex discrimination, \nand nothing in Section 1557 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity.   \nSection 1557’s nondiscrimination mandate applies to what HHS calls “covered entities.”  Cov-\nered entities include hospitals, clinics, and doctors that accept patients paying for services through \nfederal financial assistance programs, as well as state-sponsored health programs that receive federal \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 10 of 36\nfinancial assistance—like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”).  See 89 \nFed. Reg. at 37,694.  According to HHS, if “any part” of an entity participates in these financial assis-\ntance programs, then the entire entity must comply with Section 1557’s restrictions.  Id. at 37,693.   \nWhen enacting the ACA, Congress explicitly maintained the States’ traditional power to regu-\nlate the medical field.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 18122(1) (specifying that nothing in the Act “shall be \nconstrued to preempt any State or common law governing medical professional … actions or claims” \nor “to establish the standard of care or duty of care owed by a health care provider to a patient”).  It \nfurther limited HHS’s ability to interfere with providers’ power to practice medicine consistent with \ntheir ethical and evidence-based obligations.  For example, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision” \nof the ACA, HHS “shall not promulgate any regulation” that, inter alia: “impede[s] timely access to \nhealth care services”; “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment options \nbetween the patient and provider”; “restricts the ability of health care professionals to provide full \ndisclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions”; or “violates the prin-\nciples of informed consent and the ethical standards of health care professionals.”  Id. § 18114(2)-(5). \nII.  Unproven and Risky Gender-Transition Medical Interventions Stir Debate. \nSex “is an immutable characteristic,” Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality), \nthat refers to “male or female according to their reproductive organs and functions assigned by the \nchromosomal complement,” Institute of Medicine, Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: \nDoes Sex Matter? 1 n.1 (2001), https://doi.org/10.17226/10028.  By contrast, “gender identity” refers \nto an “individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of \nmale and female.”  81 Fed. Reg. 31,376, 31,467 (May 18, 2016) (“2016 Rule”) (emphasis added).   \nIn rare cases, a person’s gender identity does not align with his or her sex.  See 87 Fed. Reg. \n47,824, 47,831 n.75 (Aug. 4, 2022) (“NPRM”).  And in a subset of those few cases, individuals report \na “persistent sense of discomfort” caused by that incongruence.  L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 11 of 36\nF.4th 460, 466-67 (6th Cir. 2023).  This condition is now known as “gender dysphoria.”  Id. at 466.  \nWhile reported rates of gender dysphoria historically have been very low, they have spiked in recent \nyears—particularly among teens.  See Report of Dr. Stephen Levine 13-14, 35, 49 (Feb. 23, 2022) in \nAttach. to Cmts. of Alliance Defending Freedom, Factual Evidence, HHS-OS-2022-0012-68192.  For \nchildren not started down the path to transitioning, gender dysphoria typically resolves during pu-\nberty.  Id. at 40-42.  Thus, “[w]atchful waiting” has long served as the “standard approach” for ad-\ndressing the condition in minors.  Id. at 17-19.  Physicians did not offer to minors “what the medical \nprofession has come to call gender-affirming care” until the late 1990s.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 467. \nA.  New “gender-transition” protocols emerge. \nMedical interest groups—like the World Professional Association for Transgender Health \n(“WPATH”) and the Endocrine Society—recently have advocated for treating gender dysphoria in \nboth adults and children through a protocol of social, chemical, and surgical transition designed to \nalign their physical appearance and behavior with their gender identity:  so-called “gender-affirming \ncare.”1  The gender-transition protocol embraced by these groups proceeds in four escalating steps: \n(1) social transition with mental health treatment; (2) puberty blockers (for those who have not com-\npleted puberty); (3) cross-sex hormones; and (4) gender-transition surgery.  See Jason Rafferty, et al., \nEnsuring Comprehensive Care and Support for Transgender and Gender-Diverse Children and Adolescents, 142 Pe-\ndiatrics 1, 6-7 (2018); see WPATH 7 at 57; WPATH 8 at S258, App’x E.   \nThe “standards” pushed by WPATH have become more aggressive over time.  Compl. ¶¶ 85-\n86.  Indeed, WPATH’s latest set of “standards” removes all minimum-age requirements for cross-sex \nhormones  and  all  gender-transition  surgeries  except  for  phalloplasty  (constructing  a  penis-like \n \n1 See WPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8, 28 Int’l J. of \nTransgender Health S1 (2022) (“WPATH 8”); WPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, \nand Gender-Nonconforming People, Version 7 (2012), HHS-OS-2022-0012-4074 (“WPATH 7”); Hembree, et al., \nEndocrine Treatment of Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, 10 \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 3869, 3896 (2017), HHS-OS-2022-0012-4060 (“Endocrine Society Guideline”).   \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 12 of 36\nstructure using skin tissue).  WPATH 8, at S43-79.  According to WPATH, “medically necessary” \n“gender-affirming surgical procedures,” include “[m]astectomy” (removal of breasts), “[o]rchiectomy” \n(removal of testicles), and “vaginoplasty” (replacing male genitalia with a neovagina constructed from \nrepurposed tissue), to name only a few.  WPATH 8 at S18, S128.  These medical interventions, coupled \nwith other components of WPATH’s “gender-affirming” protocol, pose significant health risks and \ncarry lifelong consequences, including sterilization, loss of sexual function, decreased bone density, \nincreased risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer, negative psychological consequences, and a life-\nlong dependence on hormone drugs.  Compl. ¶¶ 87-104.   \nB.  Clinicians and researchers raise concerns about the risks of these interventions. \n“[N]o one disputes” that the above-mentioned treatments for gender dysphoria “carry risks \nor that the evidence supporting their use is far from conclusive.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 489.  As WPATH \nhas acknowledged, “no controlled clinical trials of any feminizing/masculinizing hormone regimen \nhave been conducted to evaluate the safety or efficacy in producing physical transition.”  WPATH 7 \nat 47.  No reliable studies demonstrate that medical gender transition lowers suicide rates, nor is there \nreliable evidence that medical transition improves long-term mental health relative to other treatments \nlacking medical risk.  See Compl. ¶ 99 (collecting sources).  Even HHS has acknowledged the lack of \n“high quality evidence” to support the efficacy of gender-transition interventions.  See id. ¶ 101. \nGiven the inherent risks of medical gender transition, researchers and health professionals \nhave expressed increasing concern about allowing adolescents to access these interventions because \nthey often “lack the capacity to consent to such a significant and potentially irreversible treatment.”  \nL.W., 83 F.4th at 488.  With increasing frequency, detransitioners have come forward describing their \nregret for undergoing irreversible transitions.  Id. at 487; Levine, supra, at 42-45.  And recently leaked \ninternal files from WPATH have only further demonstrated that the group “is neither scientific nor \nadvocating for ethical medical care.”  Environmental Progress, The WPATH Files, Pseudoscientific \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 13 of 36\nSurgical  and  Hormonal  Experiments  on  Children,  Adolescents,  and  Vulnerable  Adults  (Mar.  4,  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/4ZCW-FF23.  WPATH-affiliated doctors have violated their “ethical requirement \nto obtain informed consent,” with “members admitting that children and adolescents cannot compre-\nhend the lifelong consequences” of “gender-affirming care.”  Id. \nCiting these concerning dynamics, some of the same “countries that pioneered these treat-\nments now express caution about them and have pulled back on their use.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 477.  \nThe “public healthcare entities of Sweden, Finland, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the United \nKingdom have raised concerns about the risks associated with puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmone treatment and supported greater caution and/or more restrictive criteria in connection with \nsuch interventions.”  Eknes-Tucker v. Gov. of Ala., 80 F.4th 1205, 1218 (11th Cir. 2023).  For example, \nthe United Kingdom has restricted puberty blockers after finding the evidence inadequate to conclude \nthey are safe and effective to treat gender dysphoria.  B.P.J. ex rel. Jackson v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., \n98 F.4th 542, 570 n.7 (4th Cir. 2024) (Agee, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).   \nC.  States regulate gender-transition interventions to protect their citizens. \nTracking the developing international consensus, more than twenty States have restricted \naccess to gender-transition interventions for children.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 471 (collecting state stat-\nutes).  For example, in 2023, Tennessee adopted SB1, which prohibits certain medical procedures—\nincluding surgeries and hormone treatments—on a minor “for the purpose of” either (1) “[e]nabling \na minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or \n(2) “[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and \nasserted identity.”  Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 68-33-102(5), 68-33-103(a)(1).  Mississippi similarly prohibits \nsuch medical procedures on a minor “for the purpose of assisting [that] individual with a gender \ntransition.”  Miss. Code Ann. § 41-141-3(d)-(f); see id. § 41-141-5.  And other Plaintiff States have \nadopted similar restrictions for minors.  See Compl. ¶¶ 126-28, 130-36. \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 14 of 36\nStates also have adopted limitations on the coverage of gender-transition interventions in their \nMedicaid programs and other state-sponsored health plans.  For instance, Tennessee’s Medicaid pro-\ngram and its CHIP program do not cover “sex change or transformation surgery.”  Id. ¶¶ 111-13.  \nSubject to limited exceptions, those programs also exclude coverage for “cosmetic surgery or surgical \nprocedures [performed] primarily for the purpose of changing the appearance of any part of the body \nto improve appearance or self-esteem.”  Id. ¶¶ 112-13.  Tennessee’s state-employee health plan has \nalso long excluded coverage for gender-transition procedures.  Id. ¶¶ 114-16. \nMississippi likewise limits access to gender-transition interventions through its state-spon-\nsored health plans.  Mississippi’s Medicaid and CHIP programs do not cover procedures “performed \nprimarily to improve physical appearance and/or to treat a mental condition through change in bodily \nform.”  Id. ¶¶ 120-21.  They also exclude coverage if the service is “experimental, investigational, or \ncosmetic in nature.”  Id.  And the Division of Medicaid is prohibited by statute from “reimburs[ing] \nor provid[ing] coverage” for certain “gender transition procedures” for minors.  See id. ¶ 122.  Addi-\ntionally, Mississippi’s state-employee health plan excludes coverage for “[s]ex transformations” and \n“[p]uberty-blocking drugs,” as well as most “cosmetic services.”  See id. ¶¶ 123-25.  And other Plaintiff \nStates implement similar exclusions.  See id. ¶¶ 126, 129, 132-33, 135. \nIII.  HHS Imposes Federal Gender-Identity Mandates in Healthcare. \nIn 2016, HHS issued a rule interpreting sex discrimination under Section 1557 to encompass \ndiscrimination based on “gender identity.”  2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 31,387-88.  But a federal district \ncourt found that interpretation unlawful, concluding that Title IX did not allow HHS’s expanded \ndefinition of sex discrimination.  See Franciscan All., v. Burwell, 227 F. Supp. 3d 660, 687, 689 (N.D. \nTex. 2016).  After Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), HHS rolled out a series of \nguidance documents again interpreting Section 1557 to prohibit discrimination based on “gender iden-\ntity” and promoting treatment guidelines from the Endocrine Society and WPATH for “children and \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 15 of 36\nadolescents.”  See Compl. ¶¶ 148-50.  That effort was also set aside as unlawful after a court recognized \nthat Bostock did not support HHS’s interpretation.  See Neese v. Becerra, 640 F. Supp. 3d 668, 675-84 \n(N.D. Tex. 2022); see also Texas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824, 838, 847 (N.D. Tex. 2022).   \nUndeterred, on May 6, 2024, HHS finalized the 2024 Rule, renewing its efforts to interpret \nSection 1557 to protect “gender identity.”  Without defining “sex,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,575, HHS \ninterprets “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex” to include, among other things, discriminating based \non “[g]ender identity.”  Id. at 37,699.  Threatening the loss of HHS funding for noncompliance, the \n2024 Rule also dictates healthcare-facility operations, imposes a national standard of care for gender \ndysphoria, and requires insurers—including States—to cover so-called “gender-affirming care.”  Id. \nat 37,701.  The 2024 Rule likewise adds controversial prohibitions against discriminating based on \ngender identity in the Medicaid and CHIP regulations.  Id. at 37,667-68.  \nUnder the 2024 Rule, no health facility may “[a]dopt or apply any policy or practice” that \n“prevents an individual from participating in a health program or activity consistent with the individ-\nual’s gender identity,” if doing so causes that individual more than de minimis harm.  Id. at 37,701.  And \n“de minimis harm” is a low bar: HHS suggests that merely “experiencing … distress” is enough to cross \nthat threshold.  Id. at 37,593.  For example, according to HHS, refusing to place a male who identifies \nas a woman in an “intimate space,” like a hospital room, with a female “would result in more than de \nminimis harm” and trigger a “violation.”  Id.; NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. 47,866-67 (same). \nAnd despite the raging debate over the efficacy of gender-transition interventions, the 2024 \nRule establishes WPATH’s protocol as the federal standard of medical care.  See NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. \nat 47,868 & n.423 (asserting covered entities “should follow clinical practice guidelines and profes-\nsional standards of care” and citing WPATH).  The 2024 Rule makes it presumptively discriminatory \nfor covered entities, such as hospitals, clinics, medical practices, and pharmacies, to “[d]eny or limit” \npuberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgeries “sought for purpose of gender transition,” so long \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 16 of 36\nas those entities provide the services for “other purposes.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701.  For example, if a \nsurgeon performs a mastectomy to treat breast cancer, he is presumptively required to remove healthy \nbreasts for the purpose of “gender transition.”  Id.; see also NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,867. \nA covered entity that refuses to further a patient’s gender transition may avoid sanctions only \nif HHS deems a refusal “clinically appropriate for a particular individual.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,701 (em-\nphasis added).  But HHS views this exception narrowly.  See id. at 37,607 (suggesting HHS would not \nrequire a doctor to provide “a prostate exam for a transgender man who does not anatomically have \na prostate”).  And the rule’s requirement of “individualized clinical judgment,” id. at 37,575, 37,595-97 \n(emphasis added), precludes any general policy against gender-transition interventions based on con-\ncerns about the efficacy and safety of those procedures.  See id. at 37,613 (suggesting that non-WPATH \nstandards “may be considered evidence of pretext for discrimination”).  Providers may not even refer \nto gender-transition interventions as “experimental or cosmetic … because this characterization is \nnot based on current standards of medical care,” as established by WPATH.  NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n47,874 c.f. id. at 47,868 & n.423 (citing WPATH’s standards as “clinical practice guidelines and pro-\nfessional standards of care”).  Even a provider who declines treatment to minors under state laws \nprohibiting such treatment would engage in “prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex” under the \nrule.  Id.; see 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,535 (purporting to “preempt” any conflicting state law). \nThe 2024 Rule also requires States and insurers to subsidize gender transitions.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. at 37,701.  According to HHS, it is presumptively discriminatory for covered insurers—including \nStates—to deny or limit “coverage of a claim,” or impose “additional cost sharing or other limitations \nor restrictions on coverage, for specific health services related to gender transition” if doing so “results \nin discrimination on the basis of sex.”  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 37,691 (requiring Medicaid \nservice contracts to prohibit policies or practices with a discriminatory “effect” on “gender identity”).  \nAnd while an insurer or State may avoid sanctions by showing that there was no “medical necessity” \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 17 of 36\nin a particular case, the 2024 Rule prohibits a “categorical coverage exclusion … for all health services \nrelated to gender transition.”  Id. at 37,701.  Failing to comply with the 2024 Rule puts the States’ \nfederal funding at risk, including Medicaid funding.  45 C.F.R. §§ 80.8, 92.303. \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction and relief pending review under 5 U.S.C. § 705.  Both \nroutes to relief allow a court to “preserve status or rights pending” completion of the proceedings by \npausing the effect of an agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 705; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  Courts consider \nfour factors in determining whether preliminary relief is appropriate: (1) whether the moving party \nhas shown a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the moving party will be irreparably \ninjured absent an injunction; (3) whether issuing an injunction will harm other parties to the litigation; \nand (4) whether an injunction is in the public interest.  United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, 274 (5th \nCir. 2024) (citation omitted); see also Career Colleges & Schs. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, \n233, 255-56 (5th Cir. 2024) (granting relief under 5 U.S.C. § 705).  Each factor supports relief here. \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nA.  The 2024 Rule is contrary to law and exceeds HHS’s statutory authority. \nA federal agency’s “power to act and how [it is] to act is authoritatively prescribed by Con-\ngress.”  City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013).  Thus, “an agency may not rewrite clear \nstatutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.”  Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 328 (2014).  Nor may an agency “confer power upon itself.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \nFCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  Yet, in the 2024 Rule, HHS attempts to shoehorn “gender identity” \ninto Section 1557’s prohibition against sex discrimination, and it attempts to pervasively regulate the \npractice of medicine—a matter within the traditional authority of the States—without congressional \nauthorization.  Because the 2024 Rule exceeds HHS’s “statutory jurisdiction [or] authority” and is \n“otherwise not in accordance with law,” it should be set aside.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 18 of 36\n1.  The 2024 Rule unlawfully defines “on the basis of sex.” \n1. The 2024 Rule exceeds HHS’s statutory authority because it regulates based on the view \nthat “on the basis of sex” protects gender identity.  Neither Section 1557 nor Title IX mentions “gen-\nder identity” as a protected category.  Instead, Congress expressly limited the statutes’ coverage to \ndiscrimination “on the basis of sex.”  42 U.S.C. § 18116(a) (incorporating 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.).  \nAnd “traditional tools of statutory interpretation” uniformly confirm that conflating “gender identity” \nwith “sex” is “contrary to the clear meaning of” Title IX.  Arangure v. Whitaker, 911 F.3d 333, 336 (6th \nCir. 2018) (quotations omitted).  As evidenced by dictionary definitions at the time of Title IX’s en-\nactment—coupled with the novelty of the term “gender identity” in the early 1970’s, see Compl. ¶¶ 51, \n54—the “ordinary meaning” of “sex” in Title IX clearly refers to the biological binary of “male” and \n“female.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 812 (11th Cir. 2022) (collecting \ndefinitions); see also Artis v. District of Columbia, 583 U.S. 71, 83 (2018) (requiring courts interpreting a \nstatutory provision to “giv[e] the words used their ordinary meaning”).   \nAs numerous courts have recognized, Title IX allows sex-based distinctions when the sexes \nare not similarly situated and allows the application of sex-based policies to transgender persons.  Ad-\nams, 57 F.4th at 812-15; D.H. ex rel A.H. v. Williamson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 638 F. Supp. 3d 821, 835-36 \n(M.D. Tenn. 2022).  It makes perfect sense to import that understanding of “sex”—and sex discrimi-\nnation—into Section 1557 because, much like in the educational context where differential treatment \nbased on sex may be warranted (e.g., facilities, sports teams), healthcare also implicates different risks \nand treatments based on biological realities that differ between men and women.   \nConsider Adams.  The transgender plaintiff there argued that separating bathrooms based on \nsex, and thus denying access to a bathroom consistent with an individual’s “gender identity,” was \ndiscriminating based on sex under Title IX.  57 F.4th at 811.  But the court explained that “the statu-\ntory context of Title IX” required a different result.  Id. at 813.  For example, conflating “sex” with \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 19 of 36\n“gender identity” would “render[] meaningless” Title IX’s express allowance of “‘separate living facil-\nities for the different sexes’” because “transgender persons—who are members of the female and \nmale sexes by birth—would be able to live in both living facilities associated with their biological sex \nand living facilities associated with their gender identity or transgender status.”  Id. (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686).  “That conclusion cannot comport” with Title IX.  Id. at 814.  The same would go for the \nmany sex-based distinctions appearing throughout Title IX and the original implementing regulations.  \nSee, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6)-(9); 34 C.F.R. § 106.33-.34 (2023).       \nStructural features of the ACA further undermine HHS’s interpretation.  For example, the \nstatute elsewhere references “different genders and sexual orientations,” see 42 U.S.C. § 294e-1(b)(2), \nsignaling that if Congress wished to prohibit gender-identity discrimination in Section 1557, it knew \nhow to do so.2  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“Where Congress includes particular \nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally \npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”). \n2. The 2024 Rule nonetheless states that “sex” discrimination prohibited by Title IX—and \nincorporated into Section 1557—includes discrimination based on “gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. \n37,698-99.  HHS relies on Bostock for this result.  But Bostock was a narrow decision limited to Title \nVII that expressly declined to “prejudge” other nondiscrimination laws, like Title IX and Section 1557, \nor whether its ruling affected common practices like sex-separated “bathrooms.”  590 U.S. at 681.  \n“[T]he Court in Bostock was clear on the narrow reach of its decision and how it was limited only to \nTitle VII itself.”  Pelcha v. MW Bancorp, Inc., 988 F.3d 318, 324 (6th Cir. 2021) (declining to apply Bostock \n \n2 Having flunked every traditional tool of statutory interpretation, HHS’s misinterpretation of Title IX and \nSection 1557 cannot be saved by Chevron deference.  HHS’s reading falls outside the range of reasonable inter-\npretations of the statutory text because it purports to resolve a policy issue of major political significance with-\nout clear congressional authority, see West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721-24 (2022), and it fails to construe \n“on the basis of sex” “to avoid serious constitutional doubts,” Brawner v. Scott Cnty., 14 F.4th 585, 592 n.2 (6th \nCir. 2021) (citation omitted).  Also, Chevron was wrongly decided.  See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo (U.S., No. \n22-451) (argued Jan. 17, 2024) (reconsidering Chevron). \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 20 of 36\nto the “because of” nondiscrimination provision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).  \nThus, courts have declined to extend Bostock beyond its narrow holding.  See, e.g., id.; L.W., 83 F.4th at \n484; Neese, 640 F. Supp. 3d at 676. \nThat makes sense.  The legal theory of Bostock is inapposite to the “discrimination” inquiry \npresented in Title IX.  Whereas Title VII prohibits certain actions “because of … sex,” full stop, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2, Title IX explicitly permits separation “on the basis of sex” in numerous circumstances, \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1)-(9).  Indeed, Title IX states that its prohibition on “discrimination” “on the \nbasis of sex,” id. § 1681(a), shall not be construed to prohibit the “maintain[ance of] separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes,” id. § 1686.  And Title IX’s implementing regulations specifically allow \ninstitutions to “operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such \nteams is based upon competitive skill,” like golf, “or the activity is a contact sport.”  34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(b).  “Title IX is clear that not all differentiation based on sex is impermissible discrimination.”  \nD.H., 638 F. Supp. 3d at 835 (emphasis added). \nHHS cannot avoid this outcome by arguing that by referencing “the ground prohibited under \n… title IX,” Section 1557 adopts only the provision barring sex discrimination, divorced from the \nbevy of surrounding provisions that allow for differential treatment of the sexes, see Compl. ¶¶ 52-53 \n(collecting cites), defining what sex discrimination means in context.  See NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n47,839 (emphasis added).  For one, by using “et seq.” when incorporating Title IX, Congress clearly \nintended Section 1557 to incorporate all of Title IX.  Et seq., Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) \n(“And those (pages or sections) that follow”).  Second, Title IX’s separate provisions (like 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1686) inform how courts construe what constitutes sex discrimination under the statute.  And third, \nHHS acknowledges that Section 1557 “incorporate[s] existing interpretations or what constitutes sex \ndiscrimination under title IX, including … case law,” like Adams, Neese, and D.H., that have concluded \nthat gender identity is not covered by Title IX.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,638.   \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 21 of 36\nHHS also errs in invoking Bostock’s proposition that “discrimination based on … transgender \nstatus necessarily entails discrimination based on sex.”  590 U.S. at 669; 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,573-75.  \nHHS’s position actually rests on the inverse of Bostock: Their argument is not that “discrimination \nbased on … transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex,” id., but that recogni-\ntion of biological sex differences “necessarily entail[]” discrimination based on transgender status.  \nUnder basic logic, the fact that B follows A (A→B) does not mean that A follows B (B→A).  And \nnothing in Bostock—or in Title IX—supports the logically distinct and clearly flawed theory that any \naction that takes into account biological sex differences necessarily takes cognizance of gender identity.  \n3. But even if Section 1557 incorporates only Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination “on \nthe basis of sex” and not its other provisions, and even if Bostock bore on the meaning of that statutory \nphrase, the 2024 Rule would still fail.  Bostock reiterated what blackletter discrimination law holds:  “To \n‘discriminate against’ a person” is “treating that individual worse than others who are similarly situated.”  \n590 U.S. at 657 (emphasis added).  There, the Court assessed an employee’s termination “simply for \nbeing … transgender.”  Id. at 650.  Being fired is a quintessential form of worse treatment, so “dis-\ncrimination” was a given.  The “similarly situated” prong was likewise satisfied, given the Court’s \nconclusion that “[a]n individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment \ndecisions” about hiring and firing.  Id. at 660.   \nBy contrast, a State plainly does not “discriminate” based on sex—i.e., treat any person worse \nthan a similarly situated comparator—when it forbids hormonal treatments and surgeries for the pur-\npose of gender transition.  See L.W., 83 F.4th at 480-83; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228; see also Lange \nv. Houston Cnty., 101 F.4th 793, 803 (11th Cir. 2024) (Brasher, J., dissenting); Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th \n122, 171-74, 177 n.19 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., dissenting).  The availability of these interven-\ntions instead turns on “the risk-reward assessment of treating this medical condition (as opposed to \nanother) with these procedures.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 483.  A restriction on access to gender-transition \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 22 of 36\ninterventions does not “establish an unequal regime for males and females” because it “applies equally \nto both sexes.”  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228.     \nFor example, a provider who performs a mastectomy to treat breast cancer but refuses to \nremove healthy breast tissue from a woman who identifies as a man is acting based on the patient’s \ndifferential medical condition or diagnosis, not sex.  Put differently, removing cancer tissue is not “to \n[the doctor’s mind], materially identical in all respects” to removing healthy tissue for the purpose of \ngender transition.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660.  That is because in medicine, as in pharmacy, the “thera-\npeutic purpose” is material to a course of treatment.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 \nU.S. 120, 142-43 (2000).  Because the medical diagnoses are different, not materially identical, there is \nno intentional sex discrimination.  See Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1228.  For purposes of these medical \ntreatments, females who identify as males are not “similarly situated” to males, and males who identify \nas females are not “similarly situated” to females, so there is no discrimination.   \nInsurers may have another reason to refuse to cover gender-transition interventions.  “Sex \nchange surgeries are a suite of medical procedures that can vary in their purpose, cost, and complex-\nity.”  Lange, 101 F.4th at 802 (Brasher, J., dissenting).  Given the high costs of these procedures—\nparticularly when performed for the purposes of gender transition—insurers, including States, can \nmake the rational decision to “cover[] medically necessary treatments but exclude[] particularly expen-\nsive, top-of-the-line procedures.”  Id.  In that case, an individual’s “sex is not relevant to the [State’s] \ninsurance at all.  All that matters is whether [the individual] is asking the insurer to pay for a constel-\nlation of medical procedures known as a ‘sex change.’”  Id. at 804.  Moreover, the “constellation of \nprocedures that are needed for a male-to-female sex change are unique and not medical procedures \nthat a natal woman could ever undergo.”  Id. at 806 (explaining a “vaginoplasty” performed on a natal \nman is different in kind from a vaginoplasty performed on a natal woman).  So “changing the [indi-\nvidual’s] sex” would not “yield[] a different” coverage choice by the insurer—meaning such a policy \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 23 of 36\npasses Bostock’s “simple test” for discrimination.  See id. (citations omitted). \nNor is it relevant that “transgender individuals [purportedly] are the only individuals who seek \ntransition-related care.”  NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,871.  Title IX prohibits only “intentional sex \ndiscrimination.”  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 173 (2005).  “[T]he regulation of a \ncourse of treatment that only gender nonconforming individuals can undergo” does not discriminate \nbased on “sex” “unless the regulation were a pretext for invidious discrimination against such individ-\nuals.”  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1229-30; see also Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236 \n(2022).  But gender-transition interventions are not “such an irrational object of disfavor” that there \nmust be intentional discrimination on the basis of gender nonconformity.  Bray v. Alexandria Women’s \nHealth Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993); see United States v. Des Moines Nav. & Ry. Co., 142 U.S. 510, 544 \n(1892) (recognizing presumption of good faith).  \n“The unsettled, developing, in truth still experimental, nature of treatments in this area surely \npermits more than one policy approach.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 488.  That is even more true as evidence \nmounts against the safety and efficacy of these interventions.  Compl. ¶¶ 87-104.  And where, as here, \nState health plans cover certain treatments for gender dysphoria—e.g., psychological treatment—there \nis “a reasonable inference that there is a ‘but for’ cause other than transgender status for the plan to decline \ncoverage” for expensive and risky interventions.  Lange, 101 F.4th at 805 (Brasher, J., dissenting).  In \nother words, “the plan draws the line between sex-change [interventions]” and other procedures, not \n“between procedures transgender people need and procedures that other people need.”  Id.   \nIn sum, the 2024 Rule’s redefinition of sex discrimination in Section 1557 to encompass “gen-\nder identity” has no basis in the statutory text.  Bostock lends HHS no support.  And the 2024 Rule’s \n“sex-classification argument … does not work on its own terms.”  L.W., 83 F.4th at 483.  Thus, the \n2024 Rule can only be understood as promoting the Biden Administration’s policy priority to read \n“gender identity” protections into nondiscrimination provisions at all costs.  See also, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 24 of 36\n40,066, 40,068-69 (May 9, 2024) (HHS rule holding that gender dysphoria constitutes a disability under \nthe Rehabilitation Act (which is also incorporated into Section 1557), even though that statute explicitly \nexcludes from its scope “transsexualism” and “gender identity disorders not resulting from physical \nimpairments,” 42 U.S.C. § 12211).  But “an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its \nown sense of how the statute should operate,” Util. Air Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 328.  The States are thus \nlikely to succeed in invalidating the 2024 Rule.   \n2.  The 2024 Rule unlawfully regulates the practice of medicine. \n“[F]rom time immemorial,” the States have maintained primary responsibility for regulating \nthe medical field through constitutionally reserved powers to protect their citizens’ health and welfare.  \nDent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 122 (1889); see NFIB v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 121 (2022) (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring).  So, if Congress “wishes to significantly alter the balance between federal and state \npower” to regulate medicine, it must use “exceedingly clear language,” U.S. Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture \nRiver Preservation Ass’n, 590 U.S. 604, 622 (2020), not “muffled hints,” Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, \n274 (2006).  But Section 1557—a nondiscrimination provision—does not clearly grant HHS authority \nto impose the 2024 Rule’s edicts regulating how covered health entities run their facilities or how \nproviders care for their patients.  Instead, HHS has unlawfully “confer[red] power upon itself,” La. \nPub. Serv. Comm’n, 476 U.S. at 374. \nWith no statutory hook whatsoever, the 2024 Rule purports to superintend key aspects of \nmedical practice while ousting States from their traditional role as regulators of the medical profession \nand medical ethics.  For example, the rule imposes a de minimis harm standard malleable enough that \nproviders cannot “refuse to place [a transgender person] in facilities consistent with their gender iden-\ntity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,593.  In other words, the 2024 Rule prohibits hospitals from maintaining sex-\nseparated “intimate space[s],” id., preferencing alleged harm to transgender patients over any adverse \nimpact to those individuals whose intimate spaces have been invaded, and despite Title IX’s explicit \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 25 of 36\nauthorization of sex-separated spaces, 20 U.S.C § 1686.  The rule’s lax de minimis harm standard also \nrisks punishing doctors who decline to give medically unsound care if that refusal causes the patient \n“distress.”  See Compl. ¶ 257.   \nThe upshot is that the 2024 Rule imposes a national standard of care for gender dysphoria \nwithout congressional authorization.  Id. ¶ 260.  It mandates that nearly all doctors nationwide provide \ntreatments pushed by an international organization recently shown to lack scientific and ethical rigor.  \nId.  Providers are prohibited from exercising their own reasonable medical judgment about the appro-\npriateness and safety of sex-transition procedures generally, nor can they decline to provide sex-tran-\nsition procedures based on the experimental nature of those procedures.  Id.  Instead, the 2024 Rule \nwould deem doctors guilty of sex discrimination simply for hewing to well-settled and scientifically \ngrounded understandings about “sex” and the attendant medical consequences.  Id. ¶¶ 257-58.  And \nby chilling providers from engaging in lines of inquiry with patients necessary to provide effective \ncare, the 2024 Rule also invades the doctor-patient relationship.  Id. ¶ 259.   \nMaking matters worse, the 2024 Rule’s gender-transition mandate purports to nullify contrary \nstate laws limiting the provision of gender-transition medical interventions to minors.  See 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 37,535, 37,598.  At the same time, the ACA explicitly protects state tort laws from preemption.  42 \nU.S.C. § 18122(3).  This puts providers in an impossible position.  If they adhere to their medical \njudgment that gender-transition interventions are inappropriate, they will lose HHS funding, but if \nthey accede to the 2024 Rule’s gender-affirming-care mandates, they open themselves to extensive \nmalpractice liability.  So, providers will be forced to pick their poison: lose HHS funding, or funnel \nthe funding they receive to a team of civil defense lawyers.  \nNothing in Section 1557 authorizes this “radical shift of authority from the States to the Fed-\neral Government” on what constitutes sound medical practice.  Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 275.  If anything, \nthe 2024 Rule contradicts Section 1554 of the ACA, which prohibits HHS from interfering with \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 26 of 36\nproviders’ practice of medicine.  Section 1554 bars HHS from adopting any rule that “impede[s] timely \naccess to health care services”; “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment \noptions between the patient and the provider”; “restricts the ability of health care professionals to \nprovide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions”; or “vio-\nlates the principles of informed consent and the ethical standards of health care professionals.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 18114(2)-(5).  Yet, the 2024 Rule would require providers to cede their reasoned medical \njudgment to the controversial positions of gender-transition advocates like WPATH, even if doing so \nwould mislead patients about the efficacy of these treatments.  Compl. ¶¶ 178-88. \nThe 2024 Rule cannot permissibly commandeer medical care along HHS’s preferred ideolog-\nical lines.  The States are likely to succeed in invalidating the 2024 Rule on this independent basis. \n3.  The Social Security Act does not authorize rules prohibiting disparate \nimpacts on gender identity. \nIn addition to purporting to implement Section 1557, the 2024 Rule also amends the standard \ncontract requirements under Medicaid and CHIP to require prohibiting any policy or practice that has \nthe “effect of discriminating” based on an individual’s “gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,691.  \nAccording to HHS, these changes to the CMS regulations are authorized by the Social Security Act \n(“SSA”), another Spending Clause statute.  Not so.  \nThe SSA requires State plans to provide “such methods of administration … as are found by \nthe Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(4).  Nothing in that statute’s plain text supports HHS’s gender-identity rules.  The phrase \n“methods of administration” surely does not do so.  The 2024 Rule’s gender-identity mandates are \nnothing like the administrative tasks identified in Section 1396a(a)(4), like setting “personnel stand-\nards,” providing for “utilization of professional medical personnel,” and “ensur[ing] necessary trans-\nportation for beneficiaries.”  A word is known by the company it keeps, Gustafen v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. \n561, 575 (1995), and the company of “methods of administration” confirms the absence of statutory \n19 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 27 of 36\nauthority.  At minimum, States lacked “clear and unmistakable” notice that HHS could impose its \ngender-identity mandate on contractors through language on “methods.”  Kentucky v. Yellen, 54 F.4th \n325, 354 (6th Cir. 2022). \nNor does 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa authorize HHS’s gender-identity mandate for CHIP.  This pro-\nvision merely states that the “purpose of” the CHIP program “is to provide funds to States to enable \nthem to initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance … in an effective and efficient \nmanner.”  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa(a).  It does not grant HHS rulemaking authority or otherwise support \nHHS’s interpretation of “sex” discrimination to include gender identity—certainly not clearly.  Adams, \n57 F.4th at 815.  Nor has HHS articulated how its gender-identity mandates would make the CHIP \nprogram more “effective and efficient.”  42 U.S.C. § 1397aa(a).  Logic suggests that added layers of \nbureaucracy and disparate-impact requirements have the opposite effect.  Because the 2024 Rule’s \ninterpretations of the relevant provisions contravene the statutory text and bedrock canons of statu-\ntory interpretation, it should be declared unlawful and set aside.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nB.  The 2024 Rule is contrary to the Spending Clause. \nThe APA requires courts to set aside and vacate agency action that is “contrary to constitu-\ntional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  And if Section 1557 allows what \nthe 2024 Rule says, then there is a serious Spending Clause problem.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.   \nSpending Clause legislation—like Section 1557—“is much in the nature of a contract: in return \nfor federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.”  Adams, 57 F.4th at \n815 (citation omitted).  But “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys \n[under Spending Clause authority], it must do so unambiguously.”  Id. (citation omitted).  This “clear-\nstatement rule” applies with special strength when a federal-funding condition “encroache[s] upon a \ntraditional state power,” such as the regulation of healthcare.  Yellen, 54 F.4th at 354.   \nNowhere in Section 1557, Title IX, the SSA, or anywhere else has Congress set out “clear and \n20 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 28 of 36\nunmistakable” authorization for HHS to regulate “nondiscrimination” based on gender identity.  Id.  \nNor does that legislation “unambiguously” condition the grant of federal money on acceptance of the \n2024 Rule’s sweeping gender-identity mandates.  See Adams, 57 F.4th at 815.  Congress did not prohibit \nhealthcare facilities from maintaining sex-segregated spaces by incorporating Title IX—which explic-\nitly permits sex-segregated spaces, see, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1686.  It did not mandate that the vast majority \nof the country’s doctors follow the non-evidence-based WPATH standards.  See 42 U.S.C. § 18114 \n(prohibiting HHS from imposing any such requirement).  And it did not command States to abandon \ntheir traditional sovereign authority over the practice of medicine, let alone affirmatively undermine \nthat authority by subsidizing treatments that a State has determined are harmful.  See id. § 18122(1), \n(3) (prohibiting HHS from establishing standards of care or preempting “State or common law gov-\nerning medical professional … liability actions or claims”).   \nHHS’s 2024 Rule itself cannot provide notice to satisfy the Spending Clause clear-statement \nrule, as the necessary “clear statement … must come directly from the statute.”  Tex. Educ. Agency v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ., 992 F.3d 350, 361 (5th Cir. 2021).  Courts throughout the country have rejected \nattempts by the federal government to modify the terms of the Spending Clause “contract” by impos-\ning new obligations on States found nowhere in statutory text.  See id.; West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 59 F.4th 1124, 1147 (11th Cir. 2023); Yellen, 54 F.4th at 353-54. \nIn any event, the 2024 Rule separately violates the Spending Clause by placing a “gun to the \nhead” of the States.  NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 581 (2012) (plurality opinion).  The Supreme Court \nhas recognized that the Spending Clause prevents Congress from offering a “financial inducement” \nthat is “so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’”  Dole v. South \nDakota, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987) (citation omitted).  If that anti-coercion limit prevents anything, it \nprevents the conditioning of more than $100 billion in federal funding for Plaintiff States—amounts \nrepresenting large portions of their overall budgets, see infra p. 23—on their ceding their longstanding \n21 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 29 of 36\npower to regulate permissible medical procedures and, indeed, facilitating controversial treatments \ncausing proven, life-long harms.  See NFIB, 567 U.S. at 581 (plurality opinion). \nC.  The 2024 Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \nThe 2024 Rule is also “arbitrary” and “capricious” on several grounds.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \nsee Compl. ¶¶ 279-85.  Chief among them:  HHS failed to adequately consider—or offer a reasoned \nexplanation addressing—the reality that their rule would prevent healthcare professionals from using \ntheir reasonable medical judgment to treat patients, undermining the provision of sound medical treat-\nment on a wide scale.  Without explanation, HHS pivoted from its prior position that preferencing \nideology over science “risk[s] masking clinically relevant, and sometimes vitally important, infor-\nmation.”  85 Fed. Reg. 37,160, 37,189-90 (June 19, 2020).  It now mandates that medical professionals \nembrace the WPATH Standards and Endocrine Society Guideline.  See NPRM, 87 Fed. Reg. at 47,868 \n& n.423.  And it does so without “respond[ing] to significant comments” pointing out that these \nstandards rest on weak evidence, Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015); see Compl. ¶ 173 \n(collecting comments), without acknowledging the lack of medical consensus on gender-transition \ninterventions or side-effects associated therewith, Compl. ¶¶ 87-104, and without addressing the po-\ntential tort liability that healthcare providers face for following unproven standards, 42 U.S.C. § \n18122(3) (stating that malpractice claims not preempted).  This is exactly the type of arbitrary decision-\nmaking that the APA protects against.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983). \nII.  Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed Absent Injunctive Relief.   \nWithout immediate intervention, HHS’s 2024 Rule will inflict significant irreparable harm on \nthe Plaintiff States, their medical providers, and their citizens.3  First, the States will suffer the \n \n3 The Complaint includes paragraphs specific to each of the Plaintiff States.  See generally ECF 1 ¶¶ 106-36, 199-\n232.  To offer additional details about the irreparable harm the Plaintiff States are likely to suffer, nine States \nhave submitted declarations.  See Exhibits A-J. \n22 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 30 of 36\n“irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.”  R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, \n194 (5th Cir. 2023) (citation omitted).  States will need to expend significant financial and personnel \nresources to comply with HHS’s mandates.  See Stephen Smith Decl. ¶¶ 13-14 (Ex. A); Cody Smith \nDecl. ¶¶ 11-12 (Ex. B); Kimberly Sullivan Decl. ¶¶ 12-13 (Ex. C); Jeremy Brunssen Decl. ¶¶13-14 \n(Ex. D).  The 2024 Rule acknowledges as much.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 37,679-82 (estimating hundreds \nof millions of dollars in costs to revise policies and procedures, train employees, and implement rec-\nord-keeping requirements); see also Compl. ¶¶ 200-01.  And HHS’s sovereign immunity guarantees \nthat Plaintiffs could not later recover those costs, even if the Rule is held unlawful. \nSecond, the 2024 Rule derogates the States’ sovereign interests in enforcing their duly enacted \nlaws and regulations.  See Texas v. Becerra, 577 F. Supp. 3d 527, 557 (N.D. Tex. 2021); see also Cameron \nv. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 595 U.S. 267, 277 (2022) (describing the power to enforce state \nlaws as “[p]aramount among the States’ retained sovereign powers”).  For instance, many of the \nPlaintiff States have adopted laws prohibiting healthcare providers from offering gender-transition \ninterventions to minors.  Compl. ¶¶ 107-09, 117-18, 126, 128, 130-36.  Many of the Plaintiff States \nhave also declined to cover certain gender-transition interventions through their Medicaid, CHIP, or \nstate-employee health programs.  Id. ¶¶ 112-13, 116, 121-26, 129, 132-35.  Compliance with the 2024 \nRule would “prevent[] the State[s] from effectuating the[ir] Legislature[s’] choice[s] and hence im-\npose[] irreparable injury.”  Valentine v. Collier, 956 F.3d 797, 803 (5th Cir. 2020) \nThird, enforcement of the 2024 Rule threatens to collectively strip Plaintiff States of more \nthan $100 billion in federal funds and to impose substantial penalties through private suits.  Id. ¶¶ 206-\n11.  The 2024 Rule makes clear that its gender-identity mandates and other provisions displace con-\ntrary state policies.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,667-68.  Because the Plaintiffs have conflicting policies, they \nface funding losses that endanger important health programs serving some of their most vulnerable \nresidents.  As one example, Tennessee annually receives more than $10 billion in HHS funding to \n23 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 31 of 36\nadminister its Medicaid and CHIP programs, which collectively serve nearly 1.5 million Tennesseans, \nincluding low-income individuals, pregnant women, children, caretaker relatives of young children, \nolder adults, and the disabled.  S. Smith Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.  But Tennessee’s Medicaid and CHIP programs \ndo not cover gender-transition surgeries.  Id. ¶¶ 9-10.  Tennessee thus faces a credible threat that HHS \nwill enforce the 2024 Rule against it and terminate its federal funding for those programs, not to \nmention the State’s exposure to civil liability under Section 1557’s private right of action.  The same \ngoes for Mississippi and the other Plaintiff States.  See, e.g., C. Smith Decl. ¶¶4-8; Brunssen Decl. ¶¶ \n4-7, 16; Roberts Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 8-9; Steven Voigt Decl. ¶¶ 5-7 (Ex. F); Robert Kerr Decl. ¶¶ 5-8, 10-11 \n(Ex. G); Wanda Davis Decl. ¶¶ 5-7 (Ex. H); Matthew Althoff Decl. ¶¶ 9-10 (Ex. I); Stephanie Azar \nDecl. ¶¶ 4-8 (Ex. J). \n  Fourth, the 2024 Rule’s mandate that health insurers cover gender-transition drugs and surger-\nies will inevitably result in increased costs for Plaintiff States’ health plans.  In addition to puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormones, WPATH lists a non-exhaustive suite of “medically necessary” so-\ncalled “gender-affirming surgical procedures”—like facelifts, lip augmentation, and hair removal.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 213-14 (citing WPATH 8 at S110, S258 App’x E).  The cost of covering these treatments \nwould be significant.  See id. ¶¶ 215-27; see, e.g., S. Smith Decl. ¶ 15; C. Smith Decl. ¶ 13; Sullivan Decl. \n¶ 14; Brunssen Decl. ¶ 16; Roberts Decl. ¶ 11-12; Kerr Decl. ¶ 11; Davis Decl. ¶¶ 11; Althoff Decl. ¶ \n14; Azar Decl. ¶ 10.  Thus, the 2024 Rule’s gender-transition mandate will have a “substantial” fiscal \neffect that Plaintiffs cannot later recover.  89 Fed. Reg. at 37,683.  \nFinally, the 2024 Rule will subject some of the Plaintiff States’ most vulnerable citizens to a \ngender-transition protocol that will leave them with irreversible side effects—including steriliza-\ntion—and life-long health risks.  Compl. ¶¶ 228-32.  The latest systematic review of the available \nresearch confirms the lack of quality evidence regarding the efficacy of medical gender transition, \nparticularly for minors.  See id. ¶ 229.  The harm from gender-transition interventions, however, is \n24 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 32 of 36\nevident.  See Compl. ¶¶ 87-104.  That adolescents often “lack the capacity to consent to such a \nsignificant and potentially irreversible treatment” amplifies these concerns.  L.W., 83 F.4th at 488.  \nWith increasing frequency, detransitioners have come forward lamenting the harmful effects of these \ninterventions and their regret for undergoing them. Id. at 487.   \nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Both Favor Preliminary Relief. \nPreliminary relief will not harm HHS or the public interest.  A stay will merely “maintain[] \nthe status quo while the court considers the issue.”  Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 768 (5th Cir. \n2015).  HHS will be able to continue enforcing Section 1557 to prevent actual “sex” discrimination, \nas well as prohibited discrimination based on race, disability, national origin, and age.  It simply will \nnot be able to enforce the misreading of Section 1557 embodied by the 2024 Rule.    \n“Any interest [the government] may claim in enforcing an unlawful [rule] is illegitimate.” BST \nHoldings v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, 618 (5th Cir. 2021).  Indeed, “our system does not permit agencies \nto act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. 758, 766 \n(2021).  Instead, the public interest lies in a correct application of the law.  See Freedom from Religion \nFound., Inc. v. Mack, 4 F.4th 306, 317 (5th Cir. 2021).  And “[e]nforcing the Spending Clause’s limita-\ntions” further advances the public interest by “help[ing] preserve state sovereignty and the ‘two-gov-\nernment system establish by the Framers.’”  West Virginia, 59 F.4th at 1149 (citation omitted).   \nMore still, the public has overwhelming interests in protecting youth and other vulnerable \ncitizens from unproven and often harmful gender-transition interventions, preventing limited state \nresources from being used to fund them, and continuing to enforce State laws that reflect the will of \nthe people without risking the loss of significant federal funding and exposure to civil liability. Pre-\nliminary relief would advance each of those interests. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant Plaintiff States’ motion for a § 705 stay and a preliminary injunction.   \n25 \n \n\n \nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 21   Filed 06/13/24   Page 33 of 36\nDate: June 13, 2024.

      "text": "Case 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 22   Filed 06/14/24   Page 1 of 4\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPI \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n \n   \nSTATE OF TENNESSEE, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n   \nv.  No. 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR \n   \nXAVIER BECERRA, in his official capacity   \nas Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human \nServices, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’  \nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED BREIFING \nOn June 13, 2024—two weeks after the filing of their Complaint—Plaintiffs filed their \nmotion to stay the effective date of, and preliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing, a newly \npromulgated nondiscrimination rule implementing Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act \n(“ACA”).  See ECF No. 20.  Within that motion for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs concurrently seek \nan expedited briefing schedule that would truncate Defendants’ response deadline by three days, \nfrom June 27 to June 24, 2024.  See Local Civil Rule 7(b)(4) (allowing fourteen days for \nDefendants’ response).  Defendants file this opposition for the limited purpose of opposing \nPlaintiffs’ request for a prejudicial, expedited briefing schedule.1   \nPlaintiffs offer no persuasive reason why expedited briefing on the merits of their motion \nshould occur at the expense of Defendants here.  Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief raises \nimportant and complex issues of national significance, as it seeks, inter alia, to preclude the U.S. \n \n1 Defendants intend to file their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay and preliminary injunction in \naccordance with the schedule established by the Court. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 22   Filed 06/14/24   Page 2 of 4\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) from enforcing portions of a significant \nnondiscrimination  rule  that  had  been  subject  to  more  than  a  year  of  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  Defendants’ response will require significant review and coordination within the \nExecutive Branch.  And truncating Defendants’ response deadline, even by three days, would \nlikely  force  Defendants  to  provide  the  Court  with  rushed  views  on  Plaintiffs’  motion  for \npreliminary relief, which, among other things, includes at least ten declarations submitted by the \nvarious Plaintiff States in support thereof.  See ECF No. 20 at 3.   \nThe Court should deny Plaintiffs’ request for expedited consideration for another reason: \nPlaintiffs should not be able to prejudice Defendants with a truncated response deadline based \nmerely on the suggestion that their proposed schedule would “align the preliminary-motions \nschedule in this case” with the briefing schedule in McComb Children’s Clinic, Ltd. v. Becerra, et \nal., No. 5:24-cv-00048 (S.D. Miss.), also pending before the Court.  See ECF No. 20 at 3.2  Not \nonly does this case present differing legal issues from McComb—stemming, among other things, \nfrom the fact that the Plaintiffs are States—but, as the Court is aware, the McComb motion for a \npreliminary injunction was filed ten days earlier, on June 3, 2024.  And even there, the Court \ngranted the McComb defendants two extra days (for a total of sixteen days) to file their response, \non June 19, 2024.  Plaintiffs should not be able to skip the line when they (1) filed their motion for \ninjunctive relief ten days after the McComb plaintiffs, and (2) filed their motion for injunctive \nrelief fourteen days after the filing of the instant Complaint.  In other words, Defendants are \nhard-pressed to see what benefit “align[ed]” schedules would provide the Court, save for limiting \nDefendants’ ability to provide a fulsome response to the issues raised in Plaintiffs’ motion.  Given \nthe nationwide import of the issues at stake and the need for review of Defendants’ response within \n \n2 No hearing date has been set in McComb as of this filing. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00161-LG-BWR   Document 22   Filed 06/14/24   Page 3 of 4\nthe Executive Branch, Defendants respectfully submit that Plaintiffs’ proposed truncating of \nDefendants’ response deadline would unfairly prejudice Defendants. \nBy contrast, Plaintiffs cannot plausibly claim (nor have they) that they will be prejudiced \nby a briefing schedule that abides by Local Civil Rule 7(b)(4).  For starters, Plaintiffs’ proposed \nbriefing schedule states that they would be willing to file a reply within two days of Defendants’ \nresponse.  See ECF No. 20 at 3.  Should Defendants file their response on June 27, 2024, in \naccordance with Local Civil Rule 7(b)(4), Plaintiffs appear to be ready to file their reply by June \n29, 2024—almost one week before the challenged HHS rule is set to take effect on July 5, 2024.  \nBut even without that concession, Plaintiffs’ implicit demand that the Court resolve the pending \nmotion before July 5, 2024, to stave off alleged irreparable harm and/or prejudice should be \nconsidered artificial at best.  At bottom, Plaintiffs seek to prevent potential enforcement actions \nthat may occur under HHS’s challenged rule.  Yet they have not shown that any enforcement \nproceeding is certainly impending on or immediately after July 5, 2024.   Nor can they.  The \nmandatory procedures for enforcement before any covered entity is threatened with a loss of \nfederal funds are lengthy.  They include notice of a potential violation, a mandatory attempt to \nmediate the potential violation, formal adjudication and administrative hearings, notice to House \nand Senate committees, and the opportunity for judicial review by an Article III judge.  See, e.g., \n42 U.S.C. § 18116(a) (Section 1557 incorporates the “enforcement mechanisms provided for and \navailable under” the referenced civil rights statutes, including Title IX.); 20 U.S.C. §§ 1682–83 \n(Title IX).  Put differently, “[a]t each point in any putative enforcement process, Plaintiffs would \nbe able to raise the same claims they now raise (well before any enforcement action has been \ntaken).”  Am. College of Pediatricians v. Becerra, 2022 WL 17084365, at *15 (E.D. Tenn.
