    "summary": "<p>This case is a follow-up to a case brought by Texas against the EEOC about its similar 2022 workplace harassment guidance regarding transgender employees; in that case, District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk ruled that the EEOC exceeded its statutory rulemaking by &ldquo;...conflat[ing] protected class status with all correlated conduct.&rdquo; Texas v. EEOC, 2022 WL 4835346 at *13 (N.D. Tex. 2022).</p>\r\n<p>This case challenges the EEOC&rsquo;s April 2024 guidance under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act about workplace harassment of transgender employees. Represented by the Heritage Foundation, Texas contested the EEOC&rsquo;s interpretation of Title VII; in particular, Texas alleged, the parts of the Guidance about pronouns, bathrooms, and dress codes conflicted with the U.S. Supreme Court's carefully limited holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and with Title VII, which (Texas argued) does not require employers to accommodate sex, but merely requires non-discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>Texas filed the case on August 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking an injunction to stop implementation and enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, because it was not (as it should have been) published in the Federal Register, was contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and exceeded EEOC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In October and November 2024, both parties moved for summary judgment. In January 2025, the newly inaugurated President Trump issued several Executive Orders stating there is no federal obligation to avoid discrimination against transgender people. On January 27, 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk ordered the parties to submit a joint brief detailing how new Executive Orders bear on the disposition of the litigation. Pursuant to the court's order, parties submitted the joint brief on February 10, 2025. In this brief, the parties agreed that plaintiffs retained standing and that, even in light of prior Executive Orders, the case was not moot.</p>\r\n<p>On May 15 2025, Judge Kacsmaryk granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that denial of accommodations for gender non-conforming employees did not constitute actionable discrimination by an employer under <em>Loper Bright. </em>2025 WL 1414332. Judge&nbsp;Kacsmaryk further stated that Congress reserved the exclusive authority to define its definition of \"sex\" under Title VII, holding that the EEOC had overstepped its authority. The decision effectively vacated relevant portions of the updated EEOC guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>This outcome was precisely the one desired by the Trump Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

BURROWS, in her \nofficial capacity as Chairman of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission; \nMERRICK B. GARLAND, in his official \ncapacity as Attorney General of the United \nStates, \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  On April 29, 2024, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), by a 3-2 \nvote,  issued  “enforcement  guidance”  purporting  to  interpret  employers’  obligations  under \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See EEOC-CVG-2024-1, Enforcement Guidance on \nHarassment in the Workplace (April 29, 2024) (the 2024 Guidance)1, attached as Exhibit 1. \n2.  The 2024 Guidance purports to interpret Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination in \nemployment in light of Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644 (2020). \n3.  In particular, the 2024 Guidance reads Title VII to require employers—including the State \nof Texas (Texas) and The Heritage Foundation (Heritage)—to make certain accommodations to \nany male employee who says that he believes he is female and any to female employee who says \n \n1  U.S.  Equal  Emp’t  Opportunity  Comm’n,  EEOC-CVG-2024-1,  Enforcement  Guidance  on \nHarassment  in  the  Workplace  (2024),  https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-\nguidance-harassment-workplace  (last visited Aug. 14, 2024). \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 2 of 31   PageID 2\nthat she believes she is male (so-called “transgender” employees)—in the name of prohibiting \ndiscrimination based on sex. \n4.  The 2024 Guidance reads Title VII to require employers to require employees to refer to \nany male employee who says he believes he is female using female pronouns, and to any female \nemployee who says she believes she is male using male pronouns (the Pronoun Accommodation.) \n5.  It also reads Title VII to require employers to allow any male employee who says he believes \nhe is female to use the female bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers, and any female employee \nwho says she believes she is male to use the male bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers (the \nBathroom Accommodation). \n6.  And it reads Title VII to require employers to allow any male employee who says he \nbelieves he is female to wear clothes complying with the dress code for females, and any female \nemployee who says she believes she is male to wear clothes complying with the dress code for males \n(the Dress Code Accommodation). \n7.  But  Bostock  explicitly  refused  to  “prejudge”  whether  Title VII  requires  such \naccommodations. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681. \n8.  The Bostock majority very carefully limited its holding—that Title VII prohibits firing a \nmale employee who says he believes he is female or a female employee who says she believes she \nis male—and did not discuss how such employers must accommodate such employees in the \nworkplace. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681–83. \n9.  Moreover, Title VII does not require employers to make accommodations for sex. \n10. It  follows  that,  under  Bostock,  Title VII  does  not  require  employers  to  make \naccommodations—that is, exemptions from workplace policies that are concededly lawful in \ngeneral—for a male employee who says he believes he is female or a female employee who says she \nbelieves she is male. \n11. Thus, EEOC may not interpret Title VII to require employers to comply with the Pronoun \nAccommodation, the Bathroom Accommodation, or the Dress Code Accommodation. \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 3 of 31   PageID 3\n12. They are accommodations because they excuse certain male employees from work rules for \nmales and exclude certain female employees from work rules for females. \n13. EEOC claims that the Pronoun Accommodation, the Bathroom Accommodation, and the \nDress  Code  Accommodation  are  not  accommodations,  but  instead  result  from  Title VII’s \nprohibition of sexual harassment in the workplace. \n14.  That is completely wrong. An employee’s statutory right to be free from sexual harassment \nis not an “accommodation” to certain employees, such that some employees may be harassed, and \nothers may not. \n15. EEOC defines workplace policies making all male employees comply with the same rules \ncovering pronouns, bathrooms, and dress code, and not allowing some males to violate those rules, \nas unlawful “discrimination based on sex.” The opposite is true. \n16. Likewise, EEOC defines making all female employees comply with the same rules covering \npronouns, bathrooms, and dress code, and not allowing some females to violate those rules, as \nunlawful “discrimination based on sex.” The opposite is true. \n17. The Court should declare unlawful, vacate, and set aside the 2024 Guidance’s Pronoun \nAccommodation, Bathroom Accommodation, and Dress Code Accommodation. \nI.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n18.  The Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this suit \nconcerns the scope of EEOC’s authority under federal law, and it also arises under the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 702–703. Further, the Court has jurisdiction to compel an officer or employee of EEOC \nto perform a duty under 28 U.S.C § 1361. Finally, the Court has the authority to award the \nrequested  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  5 U.S.C.  § 706,  28 U.S.C.  § 1361,  and \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202. \n19.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Texas is a resident of \nthis judicial district, the State and its constituent agencies have employees in this District, and a \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 4 of 31   PageID 4\nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the State’s claims against the unlawful \nagency actions of EEOC occurred in this District. \n20.  This Court is authorized to award the requested relief under the APA, the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, and its general equitable powers. \nII.  Parties \n21.  Plaintiff Texas  is  a  sovereign  State  and an  employer subject to the requirements of \nTitle VII. Through its constituent agencies, the State employes hundreds of thousands of people. \n22.  Plaintiff Heritage is a non-profit public policy think tank and expressive association that \nstands for, among other values, individual freedom and traditional American values. Heritage \nemployees approximately 300 individuals and is subject to the requirements of Title VII. \n23.  Defendant EEOC is a federal agency empowered to bring civil enforcement actions against \nemployers for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-6. EEOC \nalso may issue “right-to-sue” letters that allow private individuals to sue their employers for \nviolating EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII. See id. § 2000e-5(f). \n24.  Defendant Charlotte A. Burrows is the Chairman of EEOC. She voted to issue the \nGuidance. She is sued in her official capacity. \n25.  Defendant Merrick B. Garland is the Attorney General of the United States. The Attorney \nGeneral  is  empowered  to  bring  civil  enforcement  actions  against  governmental  employers, \nincluding Texas, for alleged violations of Title VII. The Attorney General may also issue “right-\nto-sue” letters that allow private individuals to sue their governmental employers, including \nTexas, for violating EEOC’s interpretation of Title VII. He is sued in his official capacity. \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 5 of 31   PageID 5\nIII. Background \nA.  The Statute \n1.  Title VII prohibits discrimination “because of sex.” \n26.  Title VII provides that it is “an unlawful employment practice for an employer” to \ndiscriminate against employees and applicants for employment or to deprive any individual of \nemployment opportunities “because of such individual’s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), (2). \n27.  “Employer” means “a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e(b). \n28.  “Industry affecting commerce” means “any activity, business, or industry in commerce or \nin which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce and \nincludes  any  activity  or  industry  ‘affecting  commerce’  within  the  meaning  of  the  Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 [29 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], and further includes \nany governmental industry, business, or activity.” 43 U.S.C. § 2000e(h). \n29.  Consequently, Heritage and Texas, along with the latter’s agencies, and subdivisions, are \n“employers” subject to Title VII. \n2.  Title VII does not require accommodations based on sex. \n30.  Federal law requires employers to make certain accommodations to employees. \n31.  Title VII defines religion to require employers to make some accommodations for their \nemployees’ religious beliefs. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j); Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 453 (2023). \n32.  The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to make some accommodations \nfor employees with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–32; US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, \n393 (2002). The same holds for the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). \n33.  The  Pregnant  Workers  Fairness  Act  requires  employers  to  make  reasonable \naccommodations for an employee’s pregnancy and childbirth, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000gg-1. \n34.  But  neither  Title VII  nor  any  other  federal  statute  requires  employers  to  make  any \naccommodations based on sex. \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 6 of 31   PageID 6\n3.  Discrimination “because of sex” can include workplace harassment. \n35.  The Supreme Court also reads Title VII to prohibit certain kinds of workplace harassment \nand abusive working environments. “When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory \nintimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of \nthe victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.” Oncale \nv. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998). \n36.  But courts “have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men \nand women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have \nsexual content or connotations. The critical issue, Title VII’s text indicates, is whether members \nof one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members \nof the other sex are not exposed.” Id. at 80 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n4.  EEOC and DOJ have statutory enforcement authority. \n37.  EEOC may investigate state employers for violations of Title VII. The Attorney General \nmay sue state employers to enforce Title VII. Both EEOC and the Attorney General may issue \naggrieved individuals “right-to-sue” letters, allowing those persons to sue a state employer for \nviolating Title VII. Texas v. Equal emp. Opportunity Comm’n, 933 F.3d 433, 439 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(f), 2000e-6). \n5.  EEOC has limited statutory rulemaking authority. \n38.  EEOC has the “authority from time to time to issue, amend, or rescind suitable procedural \nregulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-12(a). \n39.  In other words, EEOC has limited rulemaking power with respect to Title VII and may not \npromulgate substantive rules implementing Title VII. Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 439. \n40.  An administrative agency “literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress \nauthorizes it to do so by statute.” Fed. Election Comm’n v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 301 (2022) \n(quotations omitted). \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 7 of 31   PageID 7\nB.  Bostock v. Clayton County \n41.  On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court held Title VII’s “because of ... sex” terminology \nprohibits an employer from firing an individual for being transgender.2 Bostock, 590 U.S. at 651–52. \n42.  The Bostock Court defined “transgender” as “persons with one sex identified at birth and \nanother today.” Id. at 669. \n43.  Thus, under Bostock, Title VII prohibits firing someone for being male but identifying \nhimself as female or for being female but identifying herself as male. See id. at 681–83. \n44.  The Bostock majority emphasized that the only issue before the Court was firing someone \n“simply for being . . . transgender.” Id. at 681 (emphasis added). \n45.  It also emphasized that the issues of “sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress \ncodes” were not before the Court, and expressly declined to “prejudge any such question today,” \nand “[did] not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.” Id. \n46.  Bostock did not address harassment of “persons with one sex identified at birth and another \ntoday.” Id. at 669. \nC.  EEOC’s 2021 Guidance, Texas’s Previous Lawsuit, and this Court’s Order \nVacating the 2021 Guidance \n47.  One year after the Supreme Court decided Bostock, Defendant Burrows issued a “technical \nassistance document” (2021 Guidance),3 “professedly explaining ‘what the Bostock decision \nmeans for LGBTQ+ workers (and all covered workers) and for employers across the country’ and \n‘the  [EEOC's]  established  legal  positions  on  LGTBQ+-related  matters,  as  voted  by  the \nCommission.’” Texas v. EEOC, 633 F.Supp.3d 824, 828 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (Kacsmaryk, J.). \n \n2  Bostock  addressed  firing  employees  “for  being  homosexual  or  transgender  but  the  2024 \nEnforcement  Guidance’s  Accommodations  for  “transgender”  employees  have  no  obvious \napplication to homosexual employees. \n3 U.S. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n, Protections Against Employment Discrimination Based on \nSexual Orientation or Gender Identity, https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/protections-against-\nemployment-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-or-gender (last visited Aug. 14, 2024). \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 8 of 31   PageID 8\n48.  The 2021 Guidance stated: “Prohibiting a transgender person from dressing or presenting \nconsistent  with  that  person’s  gender  identity  would  constitute  sex  discrimination.”  2021 \nGuidance, item 9. \n49.  It also stated that “employers may not deny an employee equal access to a bathroom, locker \nroom, or shower that corresponds to the employee’s gender identity. In other words, if an employer \nhas separate bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers for men and women, all men (including \ntransgender men [i.e. women who say that they believe they are men]) should be allowed to use the \nmen’s facilities and all women (including transgender women [i.e. men who say that they believe \nthey are women]) should be allowed to use the women’s facilities.” Id., item 10 (footnote omitted). \n50.  And it stated that “intentionally and repeatedly using the wrong name and pronouns to \nrefer to a transgender employee could contribute to an unlawful hostile work environment.” Id., \nitem 11. \n51.  Texas sued EEOC to have the 2021 Guidance declared unlawful. Texas v. EEOC, 633 \nF.Supp.3d at 829. \n52.  The district court agreed with Texas and declared the 2021 Guidance unlawful and vacated \nand set aside the 2021 Guidance. Id. at 847. \n53.  Judge Kacsmaryk noted that “the crux of the parties’ disagreement distills down to one \nquestion: is the non-discrimination holding in Bostock cabined to ‘homosexuality and transgender \nstatus’  or  does  it  extend  to  correlated  conduct—specifically,  the  sex-specific:  (1) dress; \n(2) bathroom;  [and]  (3) pronoun . . . practices  underlying  the  Guidance[]?”  Id.  at  829–30 \n(emphasis in original). \n54.  The court further described the dispute as being over “the meaning of [the Bostock \nmajority’s] repeated phrase, ‘for being . . . transgender.’ The ‘for’ refers back to the discriminatory \nemployer’s actions or intentions, but what does [the Bostock majority] Gorsuch mean by ‘being’?” \nId. at 833 (emphasis in original). \n55.  The court agreed with Texas “that ‘being’ means the . . . identification (transgender) \nexpressly referenced in [the Bostock] majority opinion—but not necessarily all associated actions, \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 9 of 31   PageID 9\nwhich remain subject to case-by-case Title VII analysis, and that “the State of Texas may not \ndiscriminate against an employee . . . ‘for being transgender’—i. e., . . . ‘persons with one sex \nidentified at birth and another today’—but may regulate correlated conduct via sex-specific dress, \nbathroom, [and] pronoun . . . policies, if otherwise consistent with Title VII case law.” Id. \n56.  Similarly,  it  held  that  Bostock’s  “non-discrimination  holding”  was  “cabined  to \n‘transgender status,’” and therefore rejected EEOC’s argument that Title VII “extend[s] to \ncorrelated  conduct—specifically,  the  sex-specific:  (1) dress;  (2) bathroom;  [and] \n(3) pronoun . . . practices underlying the [2021] Guidance[].” Id. at 829. \n57.  The  court  also  denied  any  “‘false  distinction’  between  status  and  conduct,”  citing \nBostock’s repeated presumption that “there will be Title VII cases where the protected class ‘sex’ \nmay not reach particular conduct,” id. at 834; distinguished the Supreme Court’s decisions in \nChristian Legal Society v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661 (2010), and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), \nid. at 834–35; and explained that Title VII decisions from the Supreme Court and the federal \nappellate courts “reveal[] that ‘status’ and ‘conduct’ do not necessarily merge every time an \nemployee plausibly pleads a ‘closely associated’ trait,” id. at 836. \n58.  Further, the court held that the 2021 Guidance was a substantive rule because it “imposes \nnew duties and chang[ed] the text of the statute it professed to interpret. [It] imposes dress-code, \nbathroom, and pronoun accommodations as existing requirements under the law and established \nlegal positions in light of Bostock and prior EEOC decisions interpreting Title VII. But Title VII—\nas interpreted in Bostock—does not require such accommodations.” Id. at 840. \n59.  Consequently, Judge Kacsmaryk also found that EEOC had no authority to issue the \nGuidance because EEOC may only issue “procedural regulations.” Id.at 841–42 (citing U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-12(a)). \n60.  Finally, because the 2021 Guidance was substantive, Judge Kacsmaryk also found that \nEEOC was required to publish it in the Federal Register but did not, and that “even if the [2021 \nGuidance  was]  not  [a]  substantive  rule[],  FOIA’s  publication  requirement  also  applies  to \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 10 of 31   PageID 10\n‘statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by \nthe agency,’” which the 2021 Guidance is. Id. at 842. \n61.  For these reasons and others, Judge Kacsmaryk declared the 2021 Guidance unlawful and \nvacated and set aside the 2021 Guidance. \n62.  EEOC did not appeal. \nD.  The 2024 Guidance \n63.  In  October  2023,  EEOC  proposed  new enforcement  guidance  on  harassment  in  the \nworkplace.4 \n64.  EEOC published an announcement of the proposed guidance (but not the proposed \nguidance itself) in the Federal Register and requested comments. Proposed Enforcement Guidance \non Harassment in the Workplace, 88 Fed. Reg. 67,750 (Oct. 2, 2023). \n65.  On April 29, 2024, EEOC published the 2024 Guidance on the internet.5 Ex. 1. \n66.  EEOC did not publish the 2024 Guidance in the Federal Register. \n1.  The stated purpose of the 2024 Guidance reinforces its importance. \n67.  The purpose of the 2024 Guidance is stated as: “This transmittal issues the Commission’s \nguidance on harassment in the workplace under EEOC-enforced laws. It communicates the \nCommission’s position on important legal issues.” Ex. 1 at 2. \n68.  Further, according to EEOC, the Guidance “provide[s] clarity to the public regarding \nexisting requirements under the law or agency policies.” Id. \n69.  Its effective date is “[u]pon issuance”—that is, April 29, 2024. Id. \n \n4 U.S. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n, Proposed Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the \nWorkplace, https://www.eeoc.gov/proposed-enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace (last \nvisited Aug. 14, 2024). \n5Enforcement  Guidance  on  Harassment  in  the  Workplace, \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace (last visited \nAug. 14, 2024). \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 11 of 31   PageID 11\n70.  It “addresses how harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, \ndisability, or genetic information is defined under EEOC-enforced statutes and the analysis for \ndetermining whether employer liability is established.” Ex. 1 at 1. \n71.  Moreover,  “[t]his  guidance  serves  as  a  resource  for  employers,  employees,  and \npractitioners; for EEOC staff and the staff of other agencies that investigate, adjudicate, or litigate \nharassment claims or conduct outreach on the topic of workplace harassment; and for courts \ndeciding harassment issues.” Ex. 1 at 8. \n72.   The 2024 Guidance “supersedes Compliance Manual Section 615: Harassment (1987); \nPolicy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (1990); Policy Guidance on Employer Liability \nunder Title VII for Sexual Favoritism (1990); Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. \n(1994); and Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by \nSupervisors (1999).” Ex. 1 at 1–2. \n73.  In  other  words,  the  2024  Guidance  is  EEOC’s  first  new  enforcement  guidance  on \nharassment in the workplace in decades. \n2.  The  2024  Guidance  Reads  Title VII  to  impose  the  same  Dress  Code \nAccommodation, Bathroom Accommodation, and Pronoun Accommodation as \nthe 2021 Guidance. \n74.  The 2024 Guidance has substantively the same Dress Code Accommodation, Bathroom \nAccommodation, and Pronoun Accommodation as the 2021 Guidance that Judge Kacsmaryk \nfound unlawful. \n75.  Much more than the 2021 Guidance, the 2024 Guidance asserts that the Dress Code \nAccommodation, Bathroom Accommodation, and Pronoun Accommodation necessarily result \nfrom a supposed prohibition on harassment based on “gender identity”: “Sex-based discrimination \nincludes  discrimination  based  on . . . gender  identity  [citing  Bostock].  Accordingly,  sex-based \nharassment includes harassment on the basis of . . . gender identity, including how that identity is \nexpressed.” Ex. 1 at 17. \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 12 of 31   PageID 12\n76.  In contrast to EEOC’s characterization of the Accommodations as combatting unlawful \nharassing  conduct,  Judge  Kacsmaryk  characterized  the  Accommodations  as  “dress-code, \nbathroom, and pronoun accommodations.” Texas v. EEOC, 633 F.Supp.3d at 840. \n77.  The 2024 Guidance lists examples of “harassing conduct” based in gender identity. Ex. 1 \nat 17. \n78.  One example is “repeated and intentional use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with the \nindividual’s known gender identity (misgendering).” Id. \n79.  Another is an employer’s “denial of access to a bathroom or other sex-segregated facility \nconsistent with the individual’s gender identity.” Id. \n80.  The 2024 Guidance also asserts that it is unlawful to act against an employee for not \n“present[ing] in a manner that would stereotypically be associated with that person’s sex.” Id. \n81.  These correspond to the same Dress Code Accommodation, Bathroom Accommodation, \nand Pronoun Accommodation as the 2021 Guidance that Judge Kacsmaryk found unlawful. The \n2024 Guidance provides the following examples of supposedly unlawful harassment based on \ngender identity: \nExample 15: Harassment Based on Gender Identity. \nChloe, a purchase order coordinator at a retail store warehouse, is approached by \nher supervisor, Alton, who asks whether she was “born a man” because he had \nheard a rumor that “there was a transvestite in the department.” Chloe disclosed \nto Alton that she is transgender and asked him to keep this information confidential. \nAfter this conversation, Alton instructed Chloe to wear pants to work because a \ndress would be “inappropriate,” despite other purchase order coordinators being \npermitted to wear dresses and skirts. Alton also asks inappropriate questions about \nChloe’s anatomy and sexual relationships. Further, whenever Alton is frustrated \nwith Chloe, he misgenders her by using, with emphasis, “he/him” pronouns, \nsometimes in front of Chloe’s coworkers. Based on these facts, Alton’s harassing \nconduct toward Chloe is based on her gender identity. \nId. at 17–18. \nExample 46: Harassment Based on Gender Identity Creates an Objectively \nHostile Work Environment. \nJennifer, a female cashier who is transgender and works at a fast-food restaurant, is \nregularly and intentionally misgendered by supervisors, coworkers, and customers \n12 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 13 of 31   PageID 13\nover a period of several weeks. One of her supervisors, Allison, intentionally and \nfrequently uses Jennifer’s prior male name, male pronouns, and “dude” when \nreferring to Jennifer, despite Jennifer’s requests for Allison to use her correct name \nand  pronouns.  Other  managers  also  intentionally  refer  to  Jennifer  as  “he” \nwhenever they work together. In the presence of customers, coworkers ask Jennifer \nquestions about her sexual orientation and anatomy and assert that she is not \nfemale. After hearing these remarks by employees, customers also intentionally \nmisgender Jennifer and make offensive comments about her transgender status. \nBased on these facts, which must be viewed in the context of Jennifer’s perspective \nas a transgender individual, Jennifer has been subjected to an objectively hostile \nwork  environment  based  on  her  gender  identity  that  includes  repeated  and \nintentional misgendering. \nId. at 46. \n82.  The 2024 Guidance thus directly contradicts Judge Kacsmaryk’s unappealed ruling that \nTitle VII does not require accommodations based on gender identity in bathrooms, dress codes, or \npronoun usage. See Texas v. EEOC, 633 F.Supp.3d at 840. \n83.  The  2024  Guidance  acknowledges  that  “Bostock  itself  concerned  allegations  of \ndiscriminatory discharge,” but nevertheless asserts that “the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the \ndecision logically extends to claims of harassment.” Ex. 1 at 110 n.37. \n84.  EEOC acknowledged that “commenters [had] contended that . . . the proposed guidance \nexceeded the scope of Title VII as interpreted” in Bostock. \n85.  But  EEOC  denied  that  “the  guidance  exceed[s]  the  scope  of  the  Supreme  Court’s \ndecision.” Ex. 1 at 92–94. \n86.  While Bostock dealt only with “failing or refusing to hire,” EEOC asserted that the Court’s \nreasoning and Title VII’s text necessarily protect employees from discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation or gender identity with respect to other “terms, conditions, or privileges of \nemployment.” Ex. 1 at 94. \n87.  EEOC also acknowledged Bostock’s refusal to address “bathrooms, locker rooms, or \nanything else of the kind.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681; Ex. 1 at 92. \n88.  Nevertheless, EEOC cited past administrative appeals decisions and district court cases to \ndetermine that so-called “misgendering” and denying individuals access to sex-segregated spaces \n13 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 14 of 31   PageID 14\nthat correspond with their gender identity, “viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances, \n[are] potentially supportive of a hostile work environment claim.” Ex. 1 at 92–94. \n89.  EEOC made similar arguments in defense of the 2021 Guidance. But Judge Kacsmaryk \nruled that “these decisions are irrelevant because they interpret Title VII provisions applicable to \nfederal employers—not private-sector and state employers. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) \n(declaring it unlawful for private-sector and state employers to ‘fail or refuse to hire or to discharge \nany  individual,  or  otherwise  to  discriminate  against  any  individual . . . because  of  such \nindividual’s . . . sex’), with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a) (‘All personnel actions affecting employees \nor applicants for employment . . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on . . . sex . . .’). \nThese differences ‘hold the Federal Government to a stricter standard than private employers or \nstate or local governments.’” Texas v. EEOC, 633 F.Supp.3d at 836 (citing Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. \n399, 411 (2020)). \n90.  In short, the 2024 Guidance purports to extend Bostock to situations that the Bostock Court \nexplicitly declined to “prejudge”—dress codes, bathrooms/locker rooms, and pronouns—on the \ngrounds that “the Supreme Court’s reasoning logically extends” to those situations. \n91.  Under the 2024 Guidance, an employer must take affirmative steps to prevent harassment \n(defined  as  including  allowing  “transgender”  employees  the  Dress  Code  Accommodation, \nBathroom Accommodation, and Pronoun Accommodation), including monitoring the workplace \nand developing “anti-harassment polic[ies], complaint procedures, and training[s].” Ex. 1 at 67. \n92.  The 2024 Guidance requires employers with notice of harassing behavior (again, defined \nas including allowing “transgender” employees the Dress Code Accommodation, Bathroom \nAccommodation, and Pronoun Accommodation) by a non-employee to take corrective actions, \npotentially requiring the non-employee to vacate the workplace. Ex. 1 at 60, 76–85. \n14 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 15 of 31   PageID 15\n93.  The 2024 Guidance did not have unanimous support among Commissioners, passing by a \nsplit vote of 3-2 with Chairman Burrows, Vice Chair Samuels, and Commissioner Kotagal voting \nto approve.6 \nIV. Legal Analysis \nA. The Guidance is Final Agency Action \n94.  “The APA allows judicial review only of a “final agency action,” meaning an action that \n(1) mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process and (2) by which rights or \nobligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d at 441 (footnotes and quotation marks omitted). \n95.  The  2024  Guidance  is  self-evidently  the  consummation  of  EEOC’s  decisionmaking \nprocess. \n96.  An “agency’s guidance documents binding it and its staff to a legal position produce legal \nconsequences or determine rights and obligations.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 441. \n97.  EEOC describes the 2024 Guidance as “Commission-approved enforcement guidance \n[which] presents a legal analysis of standards for harassment and employer liability applicable to \nclaims of harassment under the equal employment opportunity (EEO) statutes enforced by the \nCommission,  which  prohibit  work-related  harassment  based . . . sex  (including . . . sexual \norientation[] and gender identity).” Ex. 1 at 7. \n98.  The purpose of the 2024 Guidance is stated as: “This transmittal issues the Commission’s \nguidance on harassment in the workplace under EEOC-enforced laws. It communicates the \nCommission’s position on important legal issues.” Ex. 1 at 2. \n99.  Further, according to EEOC, the 2024 Guidance “provide[s] clarity to the public regarding \nexisting requirements under the law or agency policies.” Id. \n \n6  U.S.  Equal  Emp’t  Opportunity  Comm’n,  Commission  Votes:  April  2024, \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/commission-votes-april-2024 (last visited Aug. 14, 2024) \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 16 of 31   PageID 16\n100. It “addresses how harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, \ndisability, or genetic information is defined under EEOC-enforced statutes and the analysis for \ndetermining whether employer liability is established.” Ex. 1 at 1. \n101. The document says that “[t]his guidance serves as a resource for employers, employees, \nand practitioners; for EEOC staff and the staff of other agencies that investigate, adjudicate, or \nlitigate harassment claims or conduct outreach on the topic of workplace harassment; and for \ncourts deciding harassment issues.” Ex. 1 at 8. \n102. “This guidance serves as a resource for . . . EEOC staff,” id., who will be expected to \ninvestigate employers who do not make pronoun, bathroom, and dress code accommodations for \nemployees claiming a different gender than their biological sex. \n103. Thus, the 2024 Guidance binds EEOC staff. \n104. Therefore, the 2024 Guidance is a final agency action. Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 441. \nB.  EEOC Lacks Statutory Authority to impose the Accommodations. \n1.  EEOC misreads Bostock. \n105. Bostock was a narrow decision, holding only that terminating an employee “simply for \nbeing . . . transgender” constitutes discrimination “because of…sex” under Title VII. 590 U.S. at \n650–51 (emphasis added). \n106. The  Bostock  majority  “proceed[ed]  on  the  assumption  that  ‘sex’ . . . refer[s]  only  to \nbiological distinctions between male and female,” and did not include “norms concerning gender \nidentity.” Id. at 655. \n107. The Supreme Court expressly declined to “prejudge” issues like “bathrooms, locker \nrooms, and dress codes” under Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination based on sex. Id. at 681. \n108. The 2024 Guidance attempts to extend Bostock to situations that the Supreme Court \nexplicitly declined to “prejudge.” \n109. Bostock’s narrow holding does not support the agency’s expanded application of Title VII \nto other “transgender”-related employment issues. \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 17 of 31   PageID 17\n110. Bostock’s  “non-discrimination  holding”  was  “cabined  to  ‘transgender  status,’”  and \ntherefore EEOC’s argument that Title VII “extend[s] to correlated conduct—specifically, the sex-\nspecific:  (1) dress;  (2) bathroom;  [and]  (3) pronoun . . . practices  underlying  the”  [2021] \nGuidance[],” Texas v. EEOC, 633 F.Supp.3d at 829. The same applies to the Accommodations in \nthe 2024 Guidance. \n111. Bostock did not prohibit all sex-based distinctions in employment. \n112. Bostock repeatedly cited the Supreme Court’s earlier decision in Oncale,  523 U.S. 75, as \nauthority. \n113. Oncale explained that Title VII “does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the \nways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex,” \nand “requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace.” Onccale, 523 U.S. at 81. \n114. The Oncale Court noted the central concern of Title VII was not every aspect of interaction \nin the workplace but “whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or \nconditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.” Id. at 80 (quoting \nHarris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). \n115. Bostock  did  not  nullify  the  Supreme  Court’s  longstanding  acceptance  of  differences \nbetween the sexes. It did not question any longstanding precedent beyond the narrow question \nbefore it: whether “[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being . . . transgender defies the \nlaw.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 683 (emphasis added). \n116. The analysis of Bostock (and its several hypotheticals) in Bear Creek Bible Church v. EEOC, \n571 F. Supp. 3d 571 (N.D. Tex. 2021), aff’d on other grounds, Braidwood Mgmt., Inc., v. EEOC, 70 \nF.4th 914 (5th Cir. 2023), is the one that makes the most sense of the opinion. The Bear Creek Bible \nChurch court pointed to “[t]wo diverging tests [that] have emerged in Title VII sex discrimination \nlitigation: favoritism and blindness.” Id. at 618 (citing Wittmer v. Phillips 66 Co., 915 F.3d 328, 333–\n34  (5th  Cir.  2019)  (Ho,  J.,  concurring)).  “Under  the  [favoritism  test],  ‘Title VII  prohibits \nemployers from favoring men over women, or vice versa. By contrast, under [the blindness test], \nTitle VII does more than prohibit favoritism toward men or women—it requires employers to be \n17 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 18 of 31   PageID 18\nentirely blind to a person’s sex.’” Id. (quoting Wittmer, 915 F.3d at 333–34). Thoroughly examining \nthe language of Bostock and its hypotheticals, the Bear Creek Bible Church court concluded that \n“Bostock did not explicitly endorse one or the other,” id., but a hybrid of the two: “the proper test \nmust be favoritism, plus blindness to sex if the secondary trait is . . . transgenderism.” Id. at 619.  \n117. The favoritism aspect relating to sex makes sense of Bostock’s repeated reliance on Oncale, \nwhich explained that Title VII “does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men \nand women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex,” and \n“requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81. Thus, \nTitle VII does not require a disregard of sex differences where neither sex is disadvantaged. \n118. And the blindness aspect relating to the subcategories of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity prevents other aspects of Title VII from being undermined by the subjectivity of these \nsocial constructs. Since context determines meaning, it makes sense to consider the entire context \nof the language under construction. With statutory construction, that means looking not only to \nthe provision in question, but also to “the language and design of the statute as a whole.” K Mart \nCorp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988). Courts construe statutes so one provision does not \ncontradict another. The “task is to fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.” Roberts v. \nSea-Land Servs., Inc., 566 U.S. 93, 100 (2012) (quoting FTC v. Mandel Bros., Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 389 \n(1959)). \n119. By requiring total disregard of the concept of gender identity in employment decisions, the \nblindness  approach  prevents  several  provisions  of  Title VII  from  becoming  incoherent.  For \nexample, under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973), a plaintiff must show that he (1) is a member of a protected group; (2) was qualified for the \nposition at issue; (3) was discharged or suffered some adverse employment action by the employer; \nand (4) was replaced by someone outside his protected group or was treated less favorably than \nother similarly situated employees outside the protected group.” Harrison v. Brookhaven Sch. Dist., \n82 F.4th 427, 429 (5th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). If the replacement employee were able to be \nclassified as a member of the same sex of the plaintiff based solely the replacement employee’s \n18 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 19 of 31   PageID 19\nunchallengeable assertion to be a member of that sex, Congress’s intention to protect employees \nagainst sex discrimination would be undermined. See Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed. 2013) (defining “transgender” to include \n“individuals who transiently” identify one way). \n120. Consider also the allowance in Title VII for positions where sex is a bona fide employment \nqualification, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c)(1), including for accommodating patients’ privacy interests \nin the healthcare setting, Everson v. Michigan Dep’t of Corr., 391 F.3d 737, 756–60 (6th Cir. 2004); \nJones v. Hinds Gen. Hosp., 666 F.Supp. 933, 937 (S.D. Miss. 1987) (addressing privacy concerns \nbetween male patients and female nurses). This provision could not serve its purpose if a man could \nclaim  qualification  for  such  a  position  by  his  subjective  identification  as  a  woman. \n“[I]nterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative \ninterpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.” Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, \nInc., 458 U.S. 564, 575 (1982). \n121. The 2024 Guidance does not challenge the right of employers to have sex-specific dress \ncodes, bathrooms, and pronoun usage policies as a general matter. But it requires employers to \nallow exceptions for employees who subjectively identify as the opposite sex, which destroys the \nwhole point of the policies. If employers may have sex-specific dress codes, bathrooms, and \npronoun usage policies, then they may also require their employees to comply with that policy. Cf. \nA. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 192–93 (2012) (“[W]henever \na power is given by a statute, everything necessary to making it effectual or requisite to attaining \nthe end is implied.”) (citation omitted). Sex-specific dress codes, bathrooms, and pronoun usage \npolicies do not classify based on the “gender identity” of employees but disregard that concept \naltogether, exactly as Bostock requires. Indeed, to allow employers to have sex-specific workplace \npolicies, but then require them to allow exemptions only for “transgender” employees, is contrary \nto the law as specified in Bostock. \n19 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 20 of 31   PageID 20\n2.  Federal law does not require employers to make accommodations based on sex. \n122. The 2024 Guidance reads Title VII to contain an accommodation requirement for sex, at \nleast with respect to the Dress Code, Bathroom, and Pronoun Accommodations. \n123. They are accommodations because they excuse certain males from complying with work \nrules applicable to all males, and certain females from complying with work rules applicable to all \nfemales. \n124. But  while  Title VII  requires  employers  to  make  accommodations  for  an  employee’s \nreligion, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j) (mandating religious accommodations), and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act requires employers to make accommodations for an employee’s disability, see \n42 U.S.C. § 12131–32 (mandating accommodations for disabilities), and the Pregnant Workers \nFairness  Act  requires  employers  to  make  reasonable  accommodations  for  an  employee’s \npregnancy  and  childbirth,  see 42 U.S.C.  § 2000gg-1,  no  statute  requires  employers  to  make \naccommodations for an employee’s sex generally—let alone for an employee’s “transgenderism” \nor “gender identity.” \n125. For  all  categories  in  Title VII  (other  than  religion),  courts  have  repeatedly  rejected \nattempts to conflate volitional behavior or attributes that are associated with protected classes. See \nEspinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88, 95 (1973) (rejecting conflation of citizenship or alienage \nstatus with Title VII category of national origin); EEOC v. Catastrophe Mgmt. Sols., 852 F.3d 1018, \n1032 (11th Cir. 2016) (noting “every court to have considered the issue has rejected the argument \nthat Title VII protects hairstyles culturally associated with race”) (collecting cases); In re Union \nPac.  R.R.  Emp.  Pracs.  Litig.,  479  F.3d  936,  942–45  (8th  Cir.  2007)  (rejecting  conflation  of \ncontraception use with Title VII category of sex); cf. Hazen Paper Co., v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 614, \n608–14 (1993) (rejecting conflation of age discrimination under ADEA with seniority or pension \nstatus). \n126. Consider the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that explicitly added to the definition of \n“because of sex” discrimination to include “because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or \nrelated medical conditions.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-(k). This was adopted after the Supreme Court \n20 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 21 of 31   PageID 21\nhad held that such discrimination was not covered by the general prohibition on discrimination \n“because of sex” in Title VII. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 136–38 (1976). There is \nno  such  statute  relating  to  traits  or  attributes  “associated  with”  transgenderism,  so  their \ninterpretation is doomed by the “Negative-Implication Canon[:] The expression of one thing \nimplies  the  exclusion  of  others  (‘expressio  unius  est  exclusio  alterius’).”  Reading  Law:  The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 107. \n127. While Bostock interprets Title VII to prohibit an employer from discriminating against \nemployees based on transgender status, the employer is not required to treat “transgender” \nemployees more favorably than other employees. See Tex. Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 \nU.S. 248, 259 (1981) (employers not required to give preferential treatment to minorities or \nwomen). By requiring employers to make exceptions to concededly lawful policies for practices \n“associated with” a particular “gender identity,” the 2024 Guidance turns Title VII’s prohibition \non sex discrimination into an accommodation mandate. There is no textual warrant for requiring \naccommodations  for  any  aspect  of  sex  discrimination—unlike,  for  example,  religious \naccommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). \n128. It is helpful to see how the Americans with Disabilities Act defines the term: \nThe term “reasonable accommodation” may include— \n(A)  making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable \nby individuals with disabilities; and \n(B)  job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a \nvacant  position,  acquisition  or  modification  of  equipment  or  devices, \nappropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials \nor policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other \nsimilar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. \n42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). \n129. The 2024 Guidance similarly requires the alteration—for transgender employees—of the \nordinary work rules, facilities, terms, and conditions that apply to all other employees. Cf. Doe 2 v. \nShanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Williams, J., concurring in the result) (describing \n21 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 22 of 31   PageID 22\nthe  requirement  that  all  servicemembers  serve  in  their  biological  sex  as  “declining  to \nmake . . . accommodations for gender transition,” rather than “a transgender ban”). But “[f]ailure \nto provide a reasonable accommodation is a type of unlawful discrimination . . . not generally \napplicable to all the protected status groups under Title VII and has been reserved to issues of \ndiscrimination on the basis of religion and disability.” B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment \nDiscrimination Law 265 (4th ed. 2007). \n130. The  2024  Guidance’s  accommodation  requirements  are  similar  to  Title VII’s \naccommodation requirement for religion. Title VII defines “religion” broadly to include “all \naspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that \nhe is unable to reasonably accommodate an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious \nobservance or practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j) (emphasis added). Title VII’s accommodation \nrequirement,  unlike  the  norm  of  neutrality for most anti-discrimination  provisions, requires \npreferential treatment for employees based on religious practices: \nTitle VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices—that \nthey be treated no worse than other practices. Rather, it gives them favored \ntreatment, affirmatively obligating employers not “to fail or refuse to hire or \ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individual’s” “religious observance \nand practice.” An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear \npolicy as an ordinary matter. But when an applicant requires an accommodation as \nan  “aspec[t]  of  religious . . . practice,”  it  is  no  response  that  the  subsequent \n“fail[ure] . . . to hire” was due to an otherwise-neutral policy. Title VII requires \notherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation. \nEEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 775 (2015). \n131. Bostock, on the other hand, forbids “favored treatment” based on transgender status, and \nthus  precludes  any  requirement  of  accommodation.  None  of  the  other  Title VII  protected \ncharacteristics require accommodation of employees’ voluntary “observance[s] or practice[s],” \nincluding dress, bathroom usage, or customized language demands. The religious accommodation \nrequirement “reinforce[es] the conclusion that Congress acted deliberately when it omitted” any \naccommodation requirement from the sex discrimination provision in the same section of the \nstatute. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. V. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 354 (2013). \n22 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 23 of 31   PageID 23\n132. Gender  dysphoria  and  other  gender-identity  disorders  (as  well  as  homosexuality  or \nbisexuality)  are  not  a  “disability”  that  must  be  accommodated  under  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act, see 42 U.S.C. § 12211(a), (b)(1), or the Rehabilitation Act, see 29 U.S.C. § \n705(20)(c), (F)(i). But EEOC seeks to overcome Congress’s deliberate choice to not require \naccommodations based on these concepts in the 2024 Guidance. \n133. Unlike with religion, Title VII does not protect “observance[s] or practice[s].” “[F]ailing \nor refusing to hire” based on “transgender” status alone is protected. “[T]there is nothing in \nTitle VII which requires an employer to allow employees to express their cultural identity.” Garcia \nv. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d 1480, 1487 (9th Cir. 1993). \n134. Moreover, the 2024 Guidance essentially requires employers to grant the Accommodations \nto anyone who asks for them. \n135. EEOC’s position that “transgender men” and “transgender women” are entitled to the \nAccommodations is exactly equivalent to a position that employers must allow every male and every \nfemale to choose their own male or female dress code, bathrooms, or pronouns. \n136. Thus, the 2024 Guidance treats Title VII’s term “sex” as subjective, contrary to the \nBostock court’s assumption to the contrary, contrary to the meaning of “sex” (as opposed to \n“gender”), and contrary to science. \nC.  The 2024 Guidance is a Substantive Rule  \n137. The 2021 Guidance was a substantive rule because it “imposes new duties and chang[ed] \nthe text of the statute it professed to interpret. [It] imposes dress-code, bathroom, and pronoun \naccommodations as existing requirements under the law and established legal positions in light of \nBostock  and  prior  EEOC  decisions  interpreting  Title VII.  But  Title VII—as  interpreted  in \nBostock—does not require such accommodations.” Texas v. EEOC, 663 F.Supp.3d at 840. \n138. Consequently, Judge Kacsmaryk also found that EEOC had no authority to issue the \nGuidance because EEOC may only issue “procedural regulations.” Id. at 841–42 (citing U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-12(a)). \n23 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 24 of 31   PageID 24\n139. The same applies to the Accommodations in the 2024 Guidance. \n140. The Accommodations are a substantive rule—EEOC has no power to adopt such rules. \nD.  The 2024 Guidance was not Published in the Federal Register \n141. Judge Kacsmaryk held that that even if the 2021 Guidance were not a substantive rule, \nFOIA’s publication requirement also applies to “statements of general policy or interpretations of \ngeneral applicability formulated and adopted by the agency,” id., which the 2021 Guidance was. \n142. Likewise, the 2024 Guidance was required to be published in the Federal Register even if \nit were not a substantive rule because it is a statement of general policy, or interpretations of general \napplicability, formulated and adopted by the agency. \nE.  The Effect of the 2024 Guidance on Plaintiffs \n143. Texas employes hundreds of thousands of people.  \n144. The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) requires its employees to dress tastefully and \nprofessionally and be well-groomed. If any employee dressed as a member of the opposite sex, \nTDA would consider such conduct to be a violation of its policy. \n145. TDA has both unisex and single-occupancy bathrooms and bathrooms that are designated \nby sex. It interprets “sex” as referring to biological sex rather than “gender identity”. If any \nemployee wanted to use the bathrooms designated for the opposite sex, TDA would reject such a \nrequest. \n146. TDA does not have a policy of directing its employees to use pronouns based on “gender \nidentity” to refer to other employees. It also does not discipline employees based on any use of \npronouns based on biological sex rather than the gender identity of other employees. If any \nemployee wanted TDA to require other employees to use pronouns based on gender identity, TDA \nwould reject such a request. \n147. The Guidance has a direct and immediate impact on the day-to-day business of the State, \nits agencies, and its political subdivisions, including TDA. \n24 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 25 of 31   PageID 25\n148. Texas faces imminent injury for noncompliance with the Guidance in the form of EEOC \ninvestigations, Justice Department enforcement actions, and suits by “private attorneys general,” \nTrafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211 (1972), authorized by the Justice \nDepartment. State employers, including TDA, no less than private ones, are susceptible to \n“charges” of discrimination based on EEOC’s unlawful interpretation of Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-5(b). \n149. The only difference between EEOC’s authority regarding state employers and private ones \nis that the Commission generally does not have the authority to directly initiate a civil enforcement \naction against the former. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). When it is a state employer that allegedly \ncommitted an unlawful employment practice, EEOC must refer the charge of discrimination to the \nAttorney General. Id. The Attorney General, in turn, can either sue the State or authorize the \nemployee to do so. Id. \n150. But EEOC does have the authority to investigate and adjudicate Title VII claims against a \nstate employer where the claim is on behalf of certain high-level state employees. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-16c; 29 C.F.R. §§ 1603.109, .304. \n151. The State and its agencies often face lawsuits under Title VII including on the basis of sex \ndiscrimination. \n152. EEOC has issued a substantive interpretation of Title VII that purports to preempt the \nState’s sovereign power to enact and abide by its workplace policies. The State must analyze, \nagency by agency, the risk of EEOC investigations arising from the Guidance’s standards, facing \nthe forced choice of either changing their policies at taxpayer expenses or ignoring the Guidance \nand accepting impending enforcement actions and increased costs of litigation and liability under \nTitle VII. \n153. Heritage employs approximately 300 individuals and is headquartered in Washington, DC. \n154. Heritage enforces a Dress Code that requires employees to “come to work in professional \ndress, consistent with the mission, culture, business functions, and purpose of Heritage.” \n25 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 26 of 31   PageID 26\n155. Heritage employees dress in a manner traditionally befitting their biological sex. Similarly, \nemployees use Heritage’s on-site bathroom, shower, and nursing facilities according to biological \nsex, and use pronouns that correspond to people’s biological sex in the workplace and in their work \nproduct. \n156. Heritage  provides  sex-specific  intimate  facilities  (including  bathrooms,  showers,  and \nnursing facilities) for many reasons, including to protect the privacy and safety of its employees, \nespecially women. \n157. Barring any applicable legal defenses, to avoid the liability imminently threatened by \nEEOC’s current understanding of what Title VII requires (as reflected in the 2024 Guidance), \nHeritage would need to devote significant time and resources to creating or updating policies, \ncustoms, or training programs. \n158. For example, Heritage would need to revise its existing policies to account for the myriad \nof new workplace discrimination and harassment examples the 2024 Guidance believes amount to \ndiscrimination or harassment. Heritage would also have to update or develop new materials and \ntraining programs to reflect those policy changes. \n159. All of this would require Heritage to expend up-front and ongoing resources that Heritage \nwould never recover. \n160. Heritage also would have to spend resources investigating whether it must convert all \nexisting sex-specific intimate facilities into single-occupancy units consistent with Heritage’s \nexpressive mission. In the event Heritage concludes such a project is required to comply with the \n2024 Guidance, Heritage would have to spend significant financial resources on the conversions. \nHeritage’s headquarters is in downtown Washington, D.C., just a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol, \nand available space is extremely limited, making any such conversions even costlier. \n161. The 2024 Guidance is broad, wide-ranging, and asserts various philosophical, moral, and \nideological value judgments. Some of the value judgments motivating the 2024 Guidance are \ndirectly contrary to Heritage’s own values. Fully implementing the 2024 Guidance forces Heritage \nto  affirm  certain  philosophical,  moral,  and  ideological  beliefs  with  which  Heritage  strongly \n26 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 27 of 31   PageID 27\ndisagrees. If Heritage were forced to fully implement all aspects of the 2024 Guidance, it would \nlikely damage Heritage’s message, mission, values, reputation, and culture. Such damage will \nimpose further costs on Heritage, including substantial brand and reputational damage, resource \ncosts (such as staff resignations, fewer applications for staff openings, and lost donor support) and \nmoral costs (such as lower employee morale, loss of employee privacy and safety, and forced \naffirmation of philosophical, moral, and ideological beliefs). This is unacceptable to Heritage \nbecause, as an expressive association, Heritage is one of the most prominent public voices against \nthe very gender ideology being imposed by much of the 2024 Guidance. \nV.  Claims for Relief \nCOUNT 1 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C): \nThe 2024 Guidance Contrary to Law and Exceeding Statutory Authority \n162. All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n163. Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law” or in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n164. EEOC is a federal agency within the meaning of the APA. \n165. The 2024 Guidance constitutes a final agency action reviewable under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 704. \n166. It is a “rule” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(2). \n167. The 2024 Guidance is not in accordance with law because it contradicts Title VII. \n168. Title VII, as interpreted by Bostock, forbids discrimination based on “transgender status.” \n169. Title VII’s sex-discrimination provision—unlike its religion-discrimination provision—\nhas no accommodation requirement. \n27 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 28 of 31   PageID 28\n170. The 2024 Guidance requires employers to treat employees of the same sex differently \nbased  on  the  employee’s  “gender  identity”  by  mandating  accommodations  for  transgender \nemployees with regard to generally applicable workplace policies that do not consider the concept \nof “gender identity.” \nCOUNT 2 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C): \nThe 2024 Guidance in Excess of EEOC’s Statutory Rulemaking Authority \n171. All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n172. Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law” or in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n173. The 2024 Guidance exceeds EEOC’s statutory authority because it is a substantive rule \nthat EEOC is powerless to promulgate. \n174. An administrative agency, “literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress \nauthorizes it to do so by statute.” FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. at 301 (quotation omitted). \n175. EEOC “may issue only ‘procedural regulations’ implementing Title VII and may not \npromulgate substantive rules.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 439 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-12(a)). \n176. There  are  “two  criteria  [that]  distinguish  [procedural  rules]  from  substantive  rules: \nwhether the rule (1) impose[s] any rights and obligations and (2) genuinely leaves the agency and \nits decisionmakers free to exercise discretion.” Texas v. United States (DAPA), 809 F.3d 134, 151–\n55 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted). \n177. Under those criteria, the 2024 Guidance is a substantive rule. \n178. “Because the Guidance is a substantive rule, and the text of Title VII and precedent \nconfirm that EEOC lacks authority to promulgate substantive rules implementing Title VII,” \nTexas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 451, it is unlawful and must be set aside. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n179. Because the 2024 Guidance is not in accordance with the law, it is invalid and must be set \naside. Id. \n28 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 29 of 31   PageID 29\nCOUNT 3 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A): \nThe 2024 Guidance is Arbitrary and Capricious \n180. All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n181. Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be . . .  arbitrary and capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n182. The 2024 Guidance is arbitrary and capricious because it does not account for key aspects \nof sex-segregated workplace policies.  \n183. Most notably, EEOC failed to consider or address the long-recognized privacy and safety \njustifications for sex-segregated spaces, which have long been recognized by courts as valuable and \nlawful. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.10 (1996). Sex-separate restrooms \nand changing facilities  reduces  the potential for harassment, voyeurism, and even violence, \nespecially against women. See id. at 533 (recognizing the “enduring” “[p]hysical differences \nbetween men and women”). Yet EEOC disregarded those justifications.  \n184. Relatedly, EEOC disregarded that the 2024 Guidance very well may expose employers to \nTitle VII liability by increasing the potential for harassment, voyeurism, and even violence, \nespecially against women.  \n185. EEOC also ignored the heavy implementation burdens on employers, for whom it is nearly \nimpossible to discern and verify gender identity, especially given that some individuals claim to \nchange their gender identity over time or identify as genderless. The end result is that the 2024 \nGuidance allows every male and every female to choose their own male or female dress code, \nbathrooms, or pronouns. \n186. EEOC also failed to account for the 2024 Guidance’s disruption to federalism. Texas and \nother Staters have enacted laws and policies that cannot co-exist with the 2024 Guidance, yet \nEEOC ignored this “[i]ntrusive federal oversight of State administration.” E.O. 13132, § 3(c) \n(requiring that federal agencies consider federalism implications of a rule). \n29 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 30 of 31   PageID 30\nCOUNT 4 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(l)(D): \nFailure to Publish in the Federal Register \n187. All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n188. The 2024 Guidance is a substantive rule, so EEOC was required to publish it in the Federal \nRegister, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(l)(D)—but did not. \n189. Even if the 2024 Guidance were not a substantive rule, EEOC was still required to publish \nit in the Federal Register because it is a “statement[] of general policy or interpretation[] of general \napplicability formulated and adopted by the agency.” Id. \nVI. Demand for Relief \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \na.  Declare that the 2024 Guidance is unlawful; \nb.  Vacate and set aside the 2024 Guidance; \nc.  Issue a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing or implementing the \n2024  Guidance  and  from  interpreting  Title VII  to  require  employers  to  provide  the \nAccommodations; \nd.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees; and \ne.  Award such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \n   \n30 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/15/24    Page 31 of 31   PageID 31\nDated: August 15, 2024.

Case No. 2:24-cv-173-Z \nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY \nCOMMISSION, et al., \nDefendants. \nJOINT BRIEF ON EFFECT OF RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER  \nThe Parties submit this joint brief pursuant to the Court’s Order of January 27, 2025. ECF \nNo. 52.  \nPlaintiffs’ Position: \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that directed “[e]ach \nagency head [to] promptly rescind” a number of “guidance documents,” including “the Equal \nEmployment Commission’s ‘Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace’ (April 29, \n2024).” Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the \nFederal  Government,  White  House  (Jan.  20,  2025),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \npresidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring \n-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/. That document is the agency action that is the \nsubject of this lawsuit. However, the Defending Women executive order does not affect this case \nand the Court should rule on the pending cross-motions for summary judgment. \nThe document challenged in this case now has a note appended to it that it “was approved \nby the Commission on April 29, 2024, by a 3-2 vote” and “[a]ny modification must be approved \nby a majority vote of the Commission.” See Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace, \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 2 of 12     PageID 853\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/ \nguidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace. Such a vote is not currently possible. \nEEOC has published a post-Defending Women explainer on its website. See The State of the \nEEOC:  Frequently  Asked  Questions,  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity \nCommission, https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/state-eeoc-frequently-asked-questions. The State of \nthe EEOC explains that “Title VII provides that the EEOC’s Commission leadership panel is \ncomprised of five Commissioners, one of whom is designated by the President as Chair or Acting \nChair [and] also states that three Commissioners constitute a quorum at the agency,” but “[a]s of \nJanuary 28, 2025, the Commission has two Commissioners and thus no longer has a quorum.” The \nState of the EEOC at Answer to Question No. 3. Answering whether “the EEOC need[s] a quorum \nto vote on rulemaking, issue new policies, or rescind guidance documents,” the Commission \nresponds: “Yes.” The State of the EEOC at Answer to Question No. 12.  \nThus, the agency action challenged in this case remains in place and is unlikely to be \nrescinded any time soon, as no replacement Commissioners have even been announced, let alone \nnominated and confirmed. \nBut doesn’t the loss of a quorum eliminate the harms of potential enforcement to Plaintiffs? \nNo, because “[i]n the absence of a quorum of Commissioners, the EEOC remains open for \nbusiness” and “continues to enforce federal antidiscrimination laws.” Id. at Answer to Question \nNo. 4. Answering whether “EEOC [can] file lawsuits without a quorum,” the Commission \nresponds “Yes” and explains that “in the case of a loss of quorum, [existing policy] provides \nlimited authority for the filing of lawsuits by the EEOC General Counsel, after providing five days’ \nnotice to Commissioners before filing suit.” Id. at Answer to Question No. 10. Also, “[t]he \nEEOC’s field offices have authority to issue subpoenas.” Id. at Answer to Question No. 11. \nAs explained by Plaintiffs, EEOC has authority to bring enforcement actions against private \nemployers (such as Plaintiff The Heritage Foundation) and against state employers for certain \nemployees under the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991 (GERA) and can refer additional \nmatters to the Department of Justice for litigation against States and localities. See ECF No. 30 at \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 3 of 12     PageID 854\n12–13.∗ Plaintiffs therefore face the same injury as before issuance of the Defending Women \nexecutive order. \nEven if there were no longer a threat of enforcement by Defendants in this case, imminent \ninjury for standing would be satisfied because “[t]he existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily \ndepends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n571 n.4 (1992) (emphasis in original; citation omitted); Carr v. Alta Verde Indus., Inc., 931 F.2d \n1055, 1061 (5th Cir. 1991) (“As with all questions of subject matter jurisdiction except mootness, \nstanding is determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint, and subsequent events do not \ndeprive the court of jurisdiction.”). \n“While the proof required to establish standing increases as the suit proceeds, the standing \ninquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the \noutcome when the suit was filed.” Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (citation omitted); see \nalso Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2019) (“‘In identifying an injury that confers standing, \ncourts look exclusively to the time of filing.’”) (citing Loa-Herrera v. Trominksi, 231 F.3d 984, 987 \n(5th Cir. 2000); Pederson v. Louisiana State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 870 (5th Cir. 2000) (“[A fact \nconcerning injury in existence] at the time of trial, however, implicates mootness; it has no bearing \non the particular litigant’s standing at the time the suit was filed.”). No facts after the date of the \nfiling of the Complaint can serve to defeat standing retroactively. See GLO v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264, \n272 n.12 (5th Cir. 2023) (“As this action was filed in October 2021, developments since then, such \nas the issuance of DHS’s June 2022 border wall plan, will not be considered” in evaluating \nstanding).  \nBut what about mootness? “[T]he burden of proving mootness is higher than simply \nshowing a lack of standing.” Franciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, 47 F.4th 368, 377 n.40 (5th Cir. 2022). \nA case is moot if “it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing \nparty.” Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 (2012) (emphasis added; \n \n∗ Page number references to docket materials refer to the number appearing at the bottom \nof the page, not the ECF-stamped PageID number at the top. \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 4 of 12     PageID 855\nquotation omitted). “[A]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the \noutcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.” Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435, 442 (1984). \nAnd even where wrongful behavior has ceased entirely, a defendant asserting mootness must \ndemonstrate it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be \nexpected to recur.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000). This standard applies equally to government defendants. See Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at \n449 (quoting and applying the “absolutely clear” standard to federal government); McKinley v. \nAbbott, 643 F.3d 403, 406 (5th Cir. 2011) (applying standard to defendant State of Texas). The only \n“lighter burden” enjoyed by sovereign governments in the Fifth Circuit is that they are afforded a \n“presumption of good faith” when they have actually repealed a challenged policy. Stauffer v. \nGearhart, 741 F.3d 574, 581-82 (5th Cir. 2014) (challenged rule already “replaced” that all agreed \ndid not “violate [Plaintiff’s]—or anyone else’s—rights”) (citations omitted).  \nThe Fifth Circuit has also extended this presumption to a government defendant’s new \nconclusion that a challenged rule “does not apply to Plaintiff’s desired activity” once the activity \nwas “explicitly spelled out.” Moore, 868 F.3d at 407. But mootness was found in Moore because \nthe government “made clear that its public event rule does not apply to Plaintiff’s desired activity” \nonce the desired activity was “explicitly spelled out” and the government “had the opportunity to \ndetermine whether that speech actually violated the public event rule.” Id. (emphasis added). \nHere, by contrast, there is no question that the challenged agency action here applies to the conduct \nPlaintiffs seek to engage in. A case is not moot where the “authority to enforce” a challenged rule \nremains despite a “change of position” as to the propriety of enforcement, and that the harm of \nlooming enforcement authority “would be redressed” by an injunction. Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d \nat 450.The Fifth Circuit has found that a challenge from a State to EEOC guidance was not moot \neven where “current DOJ policy bar[red] it from enforcing the Guidance” against the State. Id. at \n448–49. \nFinally, the relief sought by Plaintiffs extends beyond the particular agency action taken in \nEnforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace, as explained in the summary-judgment \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 5 of 12     PageID 856\nbriefing. See ECF No. 30 at 34–36; ECF No. 48 at 23. The Court should order the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief  set  forth in  Plaintiffs’ proposed order, which properly extends beyond the \nparticular document regardless of whether it is ever rescinded pursuant to the implementation of \nthe Defending Women executive order. See Proposed Order, ECF No. 30-1.  \nEven a repeal of the Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace would not \nprevent EEOC from attempting to enforce Title VII in this way in the future. The Fifth Circuit has \ntermed a “false dichotomy” the notion that “a lawsuit challenging a regulation and a lawsuit \nchallenging the underlying statute are different.” Franciscan All., Inc., 47 F.4th at 378. This is \nbecause “a challenge to an agency regulation is necessarily a challenge to the underlying statute as \nwell[] … because an agency literally has no power to act—including under its regulations—unless \nand until Congress authorizes it to do so by statute.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). As a result, \nany argument against this relief “rests on the faulty premise that [Plaintiffs were] ‘suing’ a \nregulation” as opposed to “the right way to view [this] suit [] as challenging ‘one Government \naction that causes their harm: the [EEOC’s] threatened enforcement of [Title VII], through its \nimplementing regulation.’” Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting FEC v. Cruz, 142 S. Ct. 1638, 1650 \n(2022)). “Since injunctive relief looks to the future,” Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 485 \n(1965), a plaintiff seeking prospective relief need only show that future injury is “fairly likely” at \nthe time the suit was commenced. Crawford v. Hinds Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 1 F.4th 371, 376 (5th \nCir. 2021). \nNo action regarding the guidance challenged in this case affects that likelihood. “Given \nthat the [agency] has enacted similar guidance in the past and may attempt to do so again as an end-\nrun to the Court’s relief, a broader injunction is necessary to provide complete relief.” Texas v. \nCardona, No. 4:23-CV-604-O, 2024 WL 3658767, at *50 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 5, 2024) (O’Connor. \nJ.); see also Cath. Benefits Ass’n v. Burrows, No. 1:24-CV-142, 2024 WL 4315021, at *11 (D.N.D. \nSept. 23, 2024) (in challenge to the same 2024 Guidance challenged here, granting injunction \nagainst  agency  “interpreting  or  enforcing”  Title  VII  as  requiring  pronoun  or  bathroom \naccommodations against certain employers). Thus, the availability of future injunctive relief \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 6 of 12     PageID 857\nremains even if Defendants rescind the agency action challenged in this case (which is not likely to \nhappen any time soon), and Defendants cannot meet their burden to show that “it is impossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.” Knox, 567 U.S. at 307. \nDefendants’ Position:1 \nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order, “Defending \nWomen  from  Gender  Ideology  Extremism  and  Restoring  Biological  Truth  to  the  Federal \nGovernment.” Exec. Order No. 14,168, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615 (Jan. 20, 2025). The position stated in \nthe President’s executive order is the position of the United States, notwithstanding any prior \nposition taken by the Defendants in this case. Among other items, Executive Order 14,168 directs \nthe EEOC to rescind the Guidance document Plaintiffs here challenge or such portions of it that \nare inconsistent with the interpretation expressed in the executive order. See Exec. Order 14,168 \n§ 7(c)(iv).2  \nOn the same day that he issued Executive Order 14,168, the President designated a new \nActing Chair of the EEOC, Andrea Lucas. See President Trump Designates Chairmen and Acting \nChairmen  (Jan.  20,  2025),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ \ndesignation-of-chairmen-and-acting-chairmen/.  In  addition,  on  January  27,  2025,  President \nTrump fired two EEOC Commissioners who had voted in favor of the Guidance. See Alexandra \nOlson & Claire Savage, Trump Fires Two Democratic Commissioners of Agency That Enforces Civil \nRights Laws in The Workplace, AP, (Jan. 29, 2025), https://apnews.com/article/trump-eeoc-\ncommissioners-firings-crackdown-civil-rights-c48b973cb32bad97e9da9e354ba627db.  Those \nterminations left the EEOC with only two Commissioners. See id. The EEOC thus currently lacks \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), the official capacity Defendants who \nno longer hold office have been automatically substituted by their successors. \n2  Section  7(c)(iv)  provides  “[e]ach  agency  head  shall  promptly  rescind  all  guidance \ndocuments inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General’s guidance \nissued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such \nmanner.  Such  documents  include,  but  are  not  limited  to . . . (iv)  the  Equal  Employment \nOpportunity Commission’s ‘Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace’ (April 29, \n2024).”  \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 7 of 12     PageID 858\na quorum. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4(c) (providing that “three members” of the Commission “shall \nconstitute a quorum”). \nOn January 28, 2025, Acting Chair Lucas announced a series of actions she had taken \npursuant to Executive Order 14,168. Removing Gender Ideology and Restoring the EEOC’s Role \nof  Protecting  Women  in  the  Workplace  (Jan.  28,  2025),  https://www.eeoc.gov \n/newsroom/removing-gender-ideology-and-restoring-eeocs-role-protecting-women-workplace. \nActing Chair Lucas explained her continued opposition to the portions of the Guidance that \nPlaintiffs here challenge. She acknowledged, however, that because the “Commission acts by \nmajority vote” when issuing or revising certain documents, “[b]ased on her existing authority, \n[she] cannot unilaterally remove or modify certain ‘gender-identity’-related documents subject to \nthe President’s directives in the executive order . . . includ[ing] the Commission’s Enforcement \nGuidance on Harassment in the Workplace (issued by a 3-2 vote in 2024)” and “the EEOC \nStrategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028 (issued by a 3-2 vote in 2023),” which sets out \nthe  Commission’s  official  enforcement  priorities.  Id.;  see  29  C.F.R.  § 1695.2(d)  (requiring \nCommission to approve any significant guidance document by majority vote); see also EEOC, The \nState of the EEOC: Frequently Asked Questions, Question 12, https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/state-\neeoc-frequently-asked-questions (reiterating that the “EEOC need[s] a quorum to . . . rescind \nguidance documents”). The Acting Chair has indicated that she intends the Commission to \nreconsider the portions of the Guidance at issue in this case once a quorum is established, although \nit is uncertain when a quorum will be established. To rescind or revise portions of the Guidance, \nthe Commission will have to follow the notice and comment procedures for significant guidance \ndocuments set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1695.6 which, except in limited circumstances, requires the \nCommission to put the document out for a period of notice and public comment of at least 30 days \nand to prepare and post a public response to any major concerns raised in the comments received. \nPursuant to Title VII, the EEOC is obligated to accept, and serve to the relevant employer, \nall charges of discrimination, including any charges that might be brought against plaintiff State of \nTexas and plaintiff Heritage that might contain allegations implicating the challenged portions of \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 8 of 12     PageID 859\nthe Guidance. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(b). Title VII also requires the EEOC to issue notices of \nright to sue to charging parties. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). The requirement to accept and serve \ncharges,  and  issue  notices  of  right  to  sue,  applies  even  to  charges  which  the  Commission \ndetermines fail to state a claim. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. § 1601.18(a). \nIn light of Executive Order 14,168 and her inability to rescind the Guidance at this time due \nto the lack of a quorum at the EEOC, Acting Chair Lucas has directed that all charges that implicate \nExecutive Order 14,168 be elevated for review at EEOC headquarters to determine how to comply \nwith the executive order prior to the recission or revision of the Harassment Guidance. As noted, \npursuant to Title VII, all charges continue to be accepted for filing and service. To the extent that \na charging party requests a notice of right to sue for one of those charges, EEOC will issue that \nnotice of right to sue, as statutorily required. \nOn February 4, 2025, President Trump appointed Andrew Rogers as the acting general \ncounsel of the EEOC. See Andrew Rogers Named Acting EEOC General Counsel (Feb. 4, 2025), \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/andrew-rogers-named-acting-eeoc-general-counsel. \nThe Department of Justice similarly has new leadership. Attorney General Pamela Bondi \nwas confirmed on February 4, 2025. The Department of Justice intends to fully comply with \nExecutive Order 14,168. See Memorandum from the Acting Attorney General, Compliance with \nExecutive Order on Defending Women Message for All Department of Justice Employees (Jan. 31, \n2025) (attached as Ex. 1). \nThe Court may rule on the pending cross-motions for summary judgment based on the \narguments made in the papers previously submitted in this case. See ECF No. 35 at 7–22; ECF No. \n51 at 2–12. For the reasons explained in Defendants’ prior briefing, this Court lacks jurisdiction \nover Plaintiffs’ claims and therefore Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment should be denied \nand Defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment should be granted. \nThe subsequent events listed above are fully consistent with—and, indeed, bolster—\nDefendants’ jurisdictional arguments. As noted above, under Title VII, the EEOC is obligated to \naccept and serve charges against Defendants. However, even assuming Plaintiffs had previously \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 9 of 12     PageID 860\nfaced any threat of litigation from Defendants based on the challenged statements in the Guidance, \nthat threat is now eliminated. With respect to the plaintiff State of Texas, the Department of Justice \nis the only federal agency with authority to bring a Title VII enforcement civil action against the \nState of Texas or its political subdivisions. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) (providing that if the \nCommission is unable to obtain a conciliation agreement with a government, governmental agency, \nor political subdivision, “the Commission shall take no further action and shall refer the case to \nthe Attorney General who may bring a civil action against such respondent in the appropriate \nUnited States district court”). The executive order—and DOJ’s intention to fully comply with \nit—ensures  no  action  in  alignment  with  the  challenged  Guidance  statements  will  be  filed, \nnotwithstanding any vestigial contrary statement in the Guidance. See Ex. 1. \nAs to plaintiff Heritage, the EEOC itself determines whether to bring a civil action against \nprivate employers. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). Plaintiffs argue that existing policy provides \nlimited authority for the filing of lawsuits by the EEOC General Counsel during periods in which \nthe EEOC itself lacks a quorum. But that limited authority does not extend to “cases that implicate \nareas of the law that are not settled and cases that are likely to generate public controversy.” \nEEOC, Resolution Concerning the Commission’s Authority to Commence or Intervene in Litigation and \nthe  Commission’s  Interest  in  Information  Concerning  Appeals  ¶¶ 1(e),  4  (Jan.  13,  2021), \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/resolution-concerning-commissions-authority-commence-or-intervene-\nlitigation-and-commissions-0. Plaintiffs also claim that EEOC has authority under GERA to bring \nan action against Texas; that is incorrect. ECF No. 35 at 16 n.3. Especially given those explicit \nlimitations on the EEOC’s authority to act in the absence of a quorum, Plaintiffs identify no basis \nto conclude that the EEOC would file a lawsuit based on the challenged Guidance statements. And \nPlaintiffs do not otherwise establish that the new EEOC leadership is likely to file a lawsuit against \nthem based on Title VII interpretations to which they would object. In light of these circumstances, \nPlaintiffs do not meet their burden of demonstrating they face an enforcement threat. See Neese v. \nBecerra, 123 F.4th 751, 754 (5th Cir. 2024) (vacating district court judgment because plaintiffs had \nfailed to show “that they face a credible threat of enforcement”). The possibility that a private \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 10 of 12     PageID 861\nparty might bring a lawsuit against Texas or Heritage also cannot create jurisdiction. Joint Heirs \nFellowship Church v. Akin, 629 F. App’x 627, 631 (5th Cir. 2015) (“The possibility of private \nlitigation does not constitute a credible threat of enforcement by the Commission.”). \nFinally, Plaintiffs are mistaken in asserting that their claims do not depend on the existence \nof the Guidance. “The APA allows judicial review only of a ‘final agency action[.]’” Texas v. \nEEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 704); see also ECF No. 35 at 14–22. \nPlaintiffs have identified no purported final agency action other than the Guidance that could be \nthe basis for jurisdiction under the APA. And for the reasons stated in Defendants’ summary \njudgment papers, any relief in this case must be limited to the portions of the Guidance found to \nbe unlawful. See ECF No. 35 at 37–38; ECF No. 51 at 24–25. \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 53     Filed 02/10/25      Page 11 of 12     PageID 862\nDated: February 10, 2025  Respectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON  DANIEL D.

See Texas v. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (Kacsmaryk, J.). This \nCourt concluded that Title VII does not require accommodations for the conduct that is often \nassociated with transgender status. Id. at 829–30. As a result, this Court held that requiring \nbathroom, dress code, and pronoun accommodations for transgender employees contravened Title \nVII. Id. at 829–36. \nInstead of appealing this Court’s ruling or going back to the drawing board, EEOC issued \na new guidance document that repeats the agency’s errors in every relevant respect. Just like the \n2021 Guidance, the guidance under review here requires employers to provide bathroom, dress \ncode, and pronoun accommodations for transgender-identifying employees. As EEOC sees it, an \nemployer that failed to provide such accommodations for such employees creates a hostile work \nenvironment with harassment that discriminates based on sex. Even if everyone else must use \nrestrooms, dress codes, and pronouns that correspond to their sex, the EEOC guidance forces \nemployers to permit transgender-identifying employees to do the opposite. But as this Court has \nalready held, Title VII requires no such thing.  \nThe EEOC still claims that its policy follows from Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 \n(2020), which held that Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination necessarily reaches firing an \nemployee solely “for being homosexual or transgender.” Id. at 651–52. But—as this Court has \nalready recognized—Bostock expressly declined to “prejudge” bathroom, dress code, or pronoun \nissues. Id. at 681. Moreover, the decision is best read to prohibit discriminating on the basis of \ntransgender status, not associated conduct. Finally, the logic of Bostock is that firing an employee \nbecause he identifies as transgender necessarily discriminates on the basis of sex. But declining to \naccommodate a transgender-identifying employee’s desire to use the opposite sex’s bathroom does \n1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 9 of 44     PageID 308\nnot discriminate on the basis of sex. In fact, it ensures that all employees are treated equally by \nrequiring everyone to use the bathroom that corresponds to his sex.  \nIn addition, the new EEOC guidance is arbitrary and capricious as the agency failed to \nconsider several important aspects of the problem. The guidance exceeds EEOC’s authority to \nonly issue procedural regulations. And the guidance was never published in the Federal Register, \neven though the Freedom of Information Act requires it.  \nBACKGROUND \nA. Title VII \nTitle VII makes it illegal for employers to “discriminate against” an employee “with \nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such \nindividual’s … sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Sometimes, “a plaintiff may establish a violation of \nTitle VII by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work \nenvironment.” Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66 (1986). “When the workplace is \npermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or \npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working \nenvironment, Title VII is violated.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998).  \nBecause Title VII “is directed only at discrimination because of sex,” however, it does not \nreach “all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace.” Id. (cleaned up). To show a Title VII \nviolation on a workplace harassment theory, “the critical issue … is whether members of one sex \nare exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other \nsex are not exposed.” Id. at 80 (quotation omitted).  \nWhile Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex, it does not require employers to \naffirmatively accommodate or “give preferential treatment” based on sex. Tex. Dept. of Cmty. Affairs \nv. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 259 (1981); see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(j). In this regard, Title VII treats sex \ndifferently than religion. When it comes to religion, employers must “reasonably accommodate” \nan employee’s “religious observance or practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j).  \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 10 of 44     PageID 309\nCongress limited EEOC’s authority to issue regulations under Title VII. EEOC only has \nauthority “to issue, amend, or rescind suitable procedural regulations to carry out” Title VII. 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-12(a) (emphasis added).  \nB.  The 2021 Guidance \nIn  June  2021,  EEOC  Chairman  Charlotte  Burrows  issued  a  “technical  assistance \ndocument” purportedly explaining “the EEOC’s established legal positions on LGTBQ+-related \nmatters, as voted by the Commission.” Texas, 633 F.Supp.3d at 828 (quoting the guidance). The \n2021 Guidance announced three notable positions. First, it stated EEOC’s view that “[p]rohibiting \na transgender person from dressing or presenting consistent with that person’s gender identity \nwould constitute sex discrimination.” EEOC, Protections Against Discrimination Based on Sexual \nOrientation  or  Gender  Identity,  at  Item  9  (June  15,  2021) \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/protections-against-employment-discrimination-based-\nsexual-orientation-or-gender. Second, it stated EEOC’s view that “employers may not deny an \nemployee equal access to a bathroom, locker room, or shower that corresponds to the employee’s \ngender identity.” Id. at Item 10. Third, it stated EEOC’s view that “intentionally and repeatedly \nusing the wrong name and pronouns to refer to a transgender employee could contribute to an \nunlawful hostile work environment.” Id. at Item 11.  \nTexas sued EEOC, seeking a declaration that the 2021 Guidance was unlawful and should \nbe vacated. This Court viewed the “crux” of the case as whether Bostock’s holding that Title VII \nprohibited discrimination based on “homosexuality and transgender status” also extended to \nrequire accommodations for “correlated conduct,” such as “dress-code, bathroom, and pronoun \naccommodations.” Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 829–30, 840 (emphasis added).  \nThis Court declared the 2021 Guidance unlawful and vacated it. Id. at 847. As relevant \nhere, it first held that, under Bostock, “Title VII prohibits employment discrimination because of \nsexual orientation and gender-identity status — i.e., ‘being homosexual,’ ‘being transgender’ — \nbut not necessarily all correlated conduct.” Id. at 830. As a result, the 2021 Guidance exceeded \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 11 of 44     PageID 310\nTitle VII by requiring employers to accommodate conduct associated with transgender status, such \nas “dress codes, bathrooms, and pronouns.” Id. at 832. The Court then held that EEOC had \nexceeded its statutory authority to issue only procedural rules because the 2021 Guidance was a \nsubstantive rule. Id. at 840–42. Finally, the Court held that the 2021 Guidance violated the APA \nbecause EEOC failed to publish it in the Federal Register. Id. at 842. EEOC did not appeal. \nC. The 2024 Guidance \nIn October 2023, EEOC proposed new enforcement guidance reflecting essentially the \nsame interpretation of Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination set forth in the agency’s \nvacated 2021 Guidance, this time presenting examples of what the agency considers “sex-based \nharassment”  and  requesting  public  comments.  EEOC,  Proposed  Enforcement  Guidance  on \nHarassment in the Workplace, 88 Fed. Reg. 67,750 (Oct. 2, 2023) (“Proposed Guidance”). The \nProposed Guidance was published on EEOC’s website. See https://www.eeoc.gov/proposed-\nenforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace.  The  Proposed  Guidance  asserted  that  under \nBostock’s reasoning, Title VII prohibits as “sex-based harassment” the denial of accommodations \nfor bathroom and pronoun use based on gender identity. Thus, the Proposed Guidance again \nattempted to extend Bostock to situations that the Court explicitly declined to “prejudge”—e.g., \nbathrooms and pronouns—while also proposing to impose liability on employers for the conduct \nof their customers or other third parties. \nTexas and nineteen other States commented on the Proposed Guidance, highlighting \nstatutory, constitutional, and APA flaws in EEOC’s new interpretation of Title VII. Most relevant \nhere, the States explained that the Proposed Guidance contravened EEOC’s statutory authority. \nStates’ Comment Letter at 3–4, App.007–08. The States argued that Bostock’s narrow holding \ndoes  not  support  the  agency’s  expanded  application  of  Title  VII  to  all  transgender-related \nemployment issues, such as sex-segregated bathrooms and use of pronouns. The States further \nclaimed that EEOC proposed essentially to amend Title VII to create a de facto accommodation \nrequirement for gender identity—requiring employers to exempt transgender employees from \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 12 of 44     PageID 311\ntraditional workplace policies (e.g., men use the men’s bathroom; women use the women’s \nbathroom) when they conflict with their gender identity—even though Bostock did not address this. \nAs the States explained, Congress knew how to require accommodations for certain protected \nclasses in Title VII, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j) (mandating religious accommodations), yet has \nthus far declined to do so for transgenderism or gender identity, or even sex. States’ Comment \nLetter at 4, App.008; see also Texas Comment Letter at 3, App.003. \nThe States also pointed out several policy problems with the EEOC’s approach: (1) \nallowing men who identify as women into women’s restrooms and locker rooms puts women at \nrisk; (2) the accommodation mandate will be difficult for employers to implement; and (3) the \nguidance raised significant federalism concerns.  \nOn  April  29,  2024,  EEOC  published  the  2024  Guidance  on  the  internet.  EEOC, \nEnforcement  Guidance  on  Harassment  in  the  Workplace,  App.019–207,  available  at \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace  (“2024 \nGuidance”). EEOC did not  publish the 2024 Guidance in the Federal Register.  The 2024 \nGuidance did not have unanimous support among Commissioners, which passed it by a split vote \nof 3-2. EEOC, Commission Votes: April 2024, https://www.eeoc.gov/commission-votes-april-2024 \n(last visited October 22, 2024). \nThe 2024 Guidance’s stated purpose was to “communicate[] the Commission’s position \non important legal issues” and “provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under \nthe law or agency policies. App.020. It addressed “harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  age,  disability,  or  genetic  information.”  App.019.  Citing  Bostock,  the  2024 \nGuidance  provides  that  “[s]ex-based  discrimination  under  Title  VII  includes  employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity,” and thus, “sex-based harassment \nincludes harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including how that identity is \nexpressed.” App.035.  \nThe 2024 Guidance reimposed similar dress code, bathroom, and pronoun accommodation \npolicies  as  the  2021  Guidance.  The  2024  Guidance  announced  that  “[h]arassing  conduct” \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 13 of 44     PageID 312\nincludes failure to provide a bathroom accommodation (or the “denial of access to a bathroom or \nother sex-segregated facility consistent with the individual’s gender identity”), the failure to \nprovide a pronoun accommodation (or the “repeated and intentional use of a name or pronoun \ninconsistent with the individual’s known gender identity”) to transgender employees, and the \nfailure to provide a dress code accommodation to transgender employees (or “harassing  conduct \nbecause an individuial does not present in a manner that would stereotypcially be associated wiuth \nthat person’s sex”). App.035. The 2024 Guidance then shed light on this prohibition with an \nexample that instructed.  \nExample 46: Harassment Based on Gender Identity Creates an Objectively \nHostile Work Environment. \nJennifer, a female cashier who is transgender and works at a fast-food restaurant, is \nregularly and intentionally misgendered by supervisors, coworkers, and customers \nover a period of several weeks. One of her supervisors, Allison, intentionally and \nfrequently uses Jennifer’s prior male name, male pronouns, and “dude” when \nreferring to Jennifer, despite Jennifer’s requests for Allison to use her correct name \nand  pronouns.  Other  managers  also  intentionally  refer  to  Jennifer  as  “he” \nwhenever they work together. In the presence of customers, coworkers ask Jennifer \nquestions about her sexual orientation and anatomy and assert that she is not \nfemale. After hearing these remarks by employees, customers also intentionally \nmisgender Jennifer and make offensive comments about her transgender status. \nBased on these facts, which must be viewed in the context of Jennifer’s perspective \nas a transgender individual, Jennifer has been subjected to an objectively hostile \nwork  environment  based  on  her  gender  identity  that  includes  repeated  and \nintentional misgendering. \nApp.064–065.  \nAnd the 2024 Guidance further explained that Title VII is violated by “harassing conduct \nbecause an individual does not present in a manner that would stereotypically be associated with \nthat person’s sex.” App.035. The 2024 Guidance then shed light on this statement by providing \nan example of “harassing conduct,” in which an employer “instructed” a male employee who \nidentified as female to “wear pants to work because a dress would be in ‘inappropriate.’” App.036. \nIn full, the EEOC instructed: \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 14 of 44     PageID 313\nExample 15: Harassment Based on Gender Identity. \nChloe, a purchase order coordinator at a retail store warehouse, is approached by \nher supervisor, Alton, who asks whether she was “born a man” because he had \nheard a rumor that “there was a transvestite in the department.” Chloe disclosed \nto Alton that she is transgender and asked him to keep this information confidential. \nAfter this conversation, Alton instructed Chloe to wear pants to work because a \ndress would be “inappropriate,” despite other purchase order coordinators being \npermitted to wear dresses and skirts. Alton also asks inappropriate questions about \nChloe’s anatomy and sexual relationships. Further, whenever Alton is frustrated \nwith Chloe, he misgenders her by using, with emphasis, “he/him” pronouns, \nsometimes in front of Chloe’s coworkers. Based on these facts, Alton’s harassing \nconduct toward Chloe is based on her gender identity. \nApp.035–036. \nThat  example  confirms  that  the  2024  Guidance  also  announced  a  dress-code-\naccommodation requirement: Even if the employer has a sex-specific dress code, the employer \nmust excuse men who identify as women (or women who identify as men) from that general policy \nto avoid liability for “harassing conduct.” App.035. \nThe 2024 Guidance never addressed this Court’s earlier ruling setting aside the 2021 \nGuidance. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA court “shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). A fact is “material” if its existence or non-existence “might affect the outcome of \nthe suit under the governing law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). “[T]he \nsubstantive law will identify which facts are material.” Id. at 248. A genuine issue of material fact \nexists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.” Id. The movant must inform the court of the basis of the motion and show from the record \nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986). “The \nparty opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to \narticulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim.” Ragas v. Tenn. Gas \nPipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998).  \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 15 of 44     PageID 314\nWhen reviewing summary-judgment evidence, the court must resolve all reasonable doubts \nand draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant. Walker v. Sears, \nRoebuck & Co., 853 F.2d 355, 358 (5th Cir. 1988). If enough evidence supports a disputed allegation \nthat “reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence,” the court must deny the \nmotion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe 2024 Guidance is unlawful because it contravenes Title VII, is arbitrary and capricious, \nexceeds EEOC’s authority because it is a substantive rule, and violates the Freedom of Information \nAct because it was not published in the Federal Register.  It should be declared unlawful, vacated, \nand Defendants should be permanently enjoined from interpreting or enforcing Title VII as \nincluding mandates similar to those in the 2024 Guidance. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to the 2024 Guidance is justiciable. \nA. Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the 2024 Guidance. \nTo  have  standing  to  sue,  plaintiffs  must  “[(1)]  present  an  injury  that  is  concrete, \nparticularized,  and  actual  or  imminent;  [(2)]  fairly  traceable  to  the  defendant’s  challenged \nbehavior; and [(3)] likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.” Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 733 \n(2008). This Court already held that Texas had standing to challenge the 2021 Guidance, Texas v. \nEEOC, No. 2:21-CV-194-Z, 2022 WL 22869778, at *8–12 (N.D. Tex. May 26, 2022), and the same \nresult should obtain for the 2024 Guidance. \nBoth Texas and the Heritage Foundation have standing as employers directly regulated by \nthe 2024 Guidance. “[T]here is ordinarily little question” that the “object of the action … at \nissue” is injured by the agency’s decision, or “that a judgment” setting aside “the action will \naddress” that injury. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62. The 2024 Guidance directly applies to both Texas \nand Heritage. Texas employs hundreds of thousands of people. Thwe Texas Department of \nAgriculture alone employs about 650. Miller Decl. ¶ 1, App.210; Heritage employs about 300. \nKorsvall Decl. ¶ 4, App.216. Title VII applies to both employers, and the 2024 Guidance expressly \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 16 of 44     PageID 315\nstates that it applies to both private employers and state governments. App.119. As a result, both \nemployers have standing as “the object[s] of the Guidance.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 446.  \nIf the 2024 Guidance remains in place, both Texas and Heritage face an imminent risk of \ninjury. A Texas agency (the Texas Department of Agriculture) relies on sex-specific bathroom and \ndress policies, and it does not require its employees to use pronouns based on “gender identity” \nwhen that diverges from an employees’ sex. Miller Decl. ¶¶ 6–9, App.211–212.Heritage has a dress \ncode that requires employees to “come to work in professional dress, consistent with the mission, \nculture, business functions, and purpose of Heritage,” and historically employees have dressed in \na manner traditionally befitting their biological sex. Korsvall Decl. ¶9, App.217.  \nEEOC can directly investigate and sue a private employer like Heritage, and it can refer a \ncharge of discrimination against Texas to the U.S. Attorney General, who can sue Texas or \nauthorize the aggrieved employee to do so. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b); id. § 2000e-5(f)(1). EEOC \nalso has authority to investigate certain Title VII claims against Texas. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16c; 29 \nC.F.R. §§ 1603.109, .304. \nEEOC means business: it recently sued an employer for allegedly subjecting transgender \nemployees to sexual harassment in the workplace, including by providing “unequal access to \nbathrooms.”  EEOC,  EEOC  Sues  Two  Employers  for  Sex  Discrimination, \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-two-employers-sex-discrimination-0 (Oct. 1, 2024).  \nFurther, Texas and Heritage would bear “an increased regulatory burden” from trying to \ncomply with the 2024 Guidance, if it remained in place. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 446. Texas must \nanalyze, agency by agency, the risk of EEOC investigations arising from the Guidance’s standards, \nfacing the forced choice of either overriding the State’s interest in adhering to longstanding \nemployment policies and changing them at taxpayer expense or ignoring the Guidance and \naccepting impending enforcement actions and increased costs of litigation and liability under Title \nVII. The Texas Department of Agriculture would have to devote signifcant time and resources to \nupdate or develop new training materials and treain its personnel. Miller Decl. ¶¶ 10–13, App.212. \nAnd Heritage would have to develop new materials and training programs to reflect the 2024 \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 17 of 44     PageID 316\nGuidance’s policy changes. Korsvall Decl. ¶¶ 6–9, App.217. Heritage would also have to spend \nresources investigating whether to convert all existing sex-specific intimate facilities into single-\noccupancy units. Korsvall Decl. ¶ 10, App. 217–18.  \nFinally, Texas will suffer an additional injury to its sovereignty. The 2024 Guidance will \n“pressure” Texas to “change state law,” infringing upon its “sovereign interest in the power to \ncreate and enforce a legal code.” EEOC, 933 F.3d at 447. Through the structure of its government, \nand  the  character  of  those  who  exercise  government  authority,  a  State  defines  itself  as  a \nsovereign.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991). It is a sovereign interest of a State to \ndetermine how its agencies perform their duties under state law, and how its employees conduct \nthemselves.  \nTexas law empowers  the Commissioner of the Texas Department of  Agriculture to \n“employ personnel as the duties of the department require” and to determine “their qualifications \nfor employment and their responsibilities under applicable laws relating to standards of conduct \nfor state employees.” Tex. Agric. Code § 12.013(a); id. at § 11.001. Through that authority, the \nDepartment maintains longstanding workplace policies of sex-segregated bathrooms, dress codes, \nand pronoun usage to “express certain values.” Id.; Miller Decl. passim, App.210–214. Texas’s \n“inability to enforce its duly enacted” laws “inflicts irreparable harm on the State.” Abbott v. Perez, \n138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018); see also, e.g., Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227 (10th \nCir. 2001) (irreparable harm where agency action put its “sovereign interests and public policies \nat stake”); see also Bowen v. Pub. Agencies Opposed to Soc. Sec. Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41, 50 & n.17 \n(1986) (finding “no question” that a state’s sovereignty is “diminished” and standing therefore \nexists when federal law alters the state’s ability to “structure its relationship with its employees”) \n(cleaned up). The continued existence of the 2024 Guidance will impinge on that sovereign right.  \nB.  The 2024 Guidance is final agency action. \nThe APA allows judicial review of “final agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. Agency action is \n“final” for the purposes of judicial review if two conditions are met: “First, the action must mark \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 18 of 44     PageID 317\nthe consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process—it must not be of a merely tentative \nor interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have \nbeen determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–\n78 (1997) (cleaned up). “The Supreme Court has long taken a pragmatic approach to finality, \nviewing the APA’s finality requirement as ‘flexible.” EEOC, 933 F.3d at 441 (cleaned up).  \nThis Court already held that the 2021 Guidance is final agency action; the same result \nobtains for the 2024 Guidance, which is substantively identical. Texas, 2022 WL 22869778, at *2–\n6.  \nConsummation. The first requirement of finality is easily satisfied here. See Texas, 633 F. \nSupp. 3d at 838–41; see also Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 830 (E.D. Tenn. \n2022)  (vacating  the  2021  Guidance).  Because  it  was  promulgated  after  formal  notice-and-\ncomment,  the  2024  Guidance  cannot  fairly  be  characterized  as  preliminary,  procedural,  or \nintermediate. See Toilet Goods Ass’n, Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 162 (1967). Indeed, the purpose \nof the 2024 Guidance is to “communicate[] the Commission’s position on important legal issues” \nand “provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency \npolicies.” App.020. \nLegal Consequences. An “agency’s guidance documents binding it and its staff to a legal \nposition produce legal consequences or determine rights and obligations,” satisfying the second \nrequirement. Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019). The 2024 Guidance announces \nitself  as  “Commission-approved  enforcement  guidance  [which]  presents  a  legal  analysis  of \nstandards of harassment and employer liability applicable to claims of harassment … enforced by \nthe Commission.” App.025. The 2024 Guidance further holds itself out “as a resource for \nemployers, employees, and practitioners, for EEOC staff and the staff of other agencies that \ninvestigate, adjudicate, or litigate harassment claims.” App.026 (emphasis added). And the 2024 \nGuidance gives mandatory commands to these audiences: It states authoritatively that “sex-based \nharassment includes harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including how that \nidentity is expressed.” App.035. And it provides definitive examples of factual scenarios that \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 19 of 44     PageID 318\nwould create liability for harassing conduct based on gender identity. App.035–036, Examples 14 \n& 15.  \nLike the 2021 Guidance, the 2024 Guidance “binds agency staff and the public because of \nits mandatory language.” Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 840. Through specific examples, the 2024 \nGuidance “broadly condemns” specific employment practices, leaving “no room for EEOC staff \nnot to” act “when an employer implements the condemned practice.” Id. (quotation omitted). By \nbroadly condemning employers who require employees to use restrooms, pronouns, and dress that \ncorrespond to their sex, the 2024 Guidance leaves EEOC staff no discretion about whether to \npermit such longstanding practices. The 2024 Guidance is final agency action.  \nThe 2024 Guidance’s disclaimer that it is “not meant to bind the public in any way” does \nnot change things. App.020. As this Court has explained, such “boilerplate provisions” do “not \nrender a guidance non-final where legal consequences still flow from it, as they do here.” Texas, \n2022 WL 22869778, at *5. Thus, courts ask whether the practical effects of an agency’s decision \nmake it final agency action, not whether it is “label[ed]” as such. Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 949 \n(5th Cir. 2021), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785 (2022). As EEOC \nCommissioner Andrea Lucas aptly explained in her dissent, a “rule called by any other name is \nstill a rule.” App.209.  \nA second reason that the 2024 Guidance has legal consequence is that it sets forth norms \nor safe harbors by which employers can avoid EEOC enforcement actions and public employers \ncan avoid EEOC referrals to DOJ. When, as here, “the language of the agency document is such \nthat private parties can rely on it as a norm or safe harbor by which to shape their actions, it can be \nbinding as a practical matter.” EEOC, 933 F.3d at 442 (cleaned up).  \nEEOC has the power to bring its own enforcement actions against private employers. See \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f). There is also a limited circumstance where EEOC has the authority to \ninvestigate and adjudicate Title VII claims against a state employer: where the claim is on behalf of \ncertain high-level State employees pursuant to the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991 \n(“GERA”). See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16c; 29 C.F.R. §§ 1603.109, 1603.304. This further undercuts \n12 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 20 of 44     PageID 319\nEEOC’s claims against justiciability here. EEOC and DOJ share enforcement responsibilities \nconcerning claims of discrimination against state and local governments. EEOC investigates and, \nif it finds reasonable cause that there is a violation of Title VII, attempts to a reach a settlement \nwith the State or local employer. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5. If no settlement is reached, EEOC refers \nthe matter to DOJ, which then pursues litigation. See id. § 2000e-5(f)(1). DOJ has never disavowed \nan intention to pursue enforcement of EEOC referrals pursuant to the 2024 Guidance.  \nHad EEOC reached different conclusions—by concluding that Title VII did not require \nemployers  to  adopt  dress  code,  bathroom,  or  pronoun  accommodations  in  their  workplace \npolicies—it would have “narrow[ed] the field of potential plaintiffs and limit[ed] the potential \nliability” that employers face. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs v.Hawkes, 578 U.S. 590, 599 (2016). Those \nrevised conclusions would undoubtedly result in legal consequences and “[i]t follows that” \ndenying those potential safe harbors has “legal consequences as well.” Id. “This conclusion tracks \nthe ‘pragmatic’ approach [the Supreme Court has] long taken to finality.” Id.  \nIf the 2024 Guidance had, for example, deemed policies such as those of the Texas \nDepartment of Agriculture consistent with Title VII, it would bind EEOC to find no reasonable \ncause and it could not bring an enforcement action against private employers, against State \nemployers under GERA, or refer the case to DOJ.  \nThat EEOC has no power to bring an enforcement action against Texas, see EEOC, 933 \nF.3d at 439, does not alter this conclusion. The 2024 Guidance at all times either is or is not a final \nagency action. Its status does not change based on the identity of the plaintiff challenging the \naction. See id. at 444 (“Finality, however, cannot vary depending on who sued the agency; it \ndepends on the rule itself.”). And while DOJ may still be able to bring a “pattern or practice” claim \nwithout a referral, EEOC, 933 F.3d at 439 n.5, this does not change the fact that an entire category \nof  claims  by  DOJ  would  be  eliminated.  Under  Hawkes,  denying  that  safe  harbor  is  a  legal \nconsequence.  \nThe Rule does contain three norms or safe harbors on which EEOC expects employers to \nrely in shaping their behavior: (1) the dress code accommodation provides a safe harbor for \n13 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 21 of 44     PageID 320\nemployers to avoid liability if they allow transgender employees to dress according to their gender \nidentity rather than their biological sex; the bathroom accommodation provides a safe harbor for \nemployers to avoid liability if they allow transgender employees to use bathrooms according to \ntheir gender identity rather than their biological sex; and the pronoun accommodation provides a \nsafe harbor for employers to avoid liability if they enforce any employees’ demands that co-workers \nrefer to them by pronouns according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex. That \nthese “safe harbors” are phrased in the negative (“don’t do this or you will be liable”) rather than \nin the affirmative (“do this and you will avoid liability”) is of no consequence. See EEOC, 933 F.3d \nat 442 (discussing “affirmative” versus “negative” jurisdictional determinations as safe harbors \nin Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 598–99). The 2024 Guidance is thus “binding as a practical matter because \nprivate parties can rely on it as a norm or safe harbor by which to shape their actions” “thus \nopening the field of potential plaintiffs.”  EEOC, 933 F.3d at 444 (cleaned up).  \nII.  The 2024 Guidance is contrary to law because it contravenes Title VII.  \nThe 2024 Guidance states that an employer unlawfully “discriminates” on the basis of sex \nif  it  adheres  to  sex-specific  bathroom,  dress,  or  pronoun  policies  without  accommodating \ntransgender employees. This Court already held that the 2021 Guidance contravenes Title VII, \nand the Court should do the same for the 2024 Guidance, which is substantively the same.  \nA. EEOC misreads Bostock.  \nIn Bostock, the Supreme Court was only concerned with—and thus its holding only \naddresses—allegations of discriminatory termination. See 590 U.S. at 651. It was a narrow decision, \nholding  only  that  terminating  an  employee  “simply  for  being … transgender”  constitutes \ndiscrimination “because of…sex” under Title VII. Id. at 650–51. The Court expressly declined to \n“prejudge” issues like “bathrooms, locker rooms, dress codes.” Id. at 681. And it never addressed \npronoun usage.  \nAs this Court already concluded, the best reading of Bostock is that “Title VII prohibits \nemployment discrimination against an individual ‘for being homosexual,’ ‘for being transgender’” \n14 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 22 of 44     PageID 321\nbut does not reach “all correlated conduct.” Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 831. Thus, the 2024 \nGuidance “misread[s] Bostock by melding ‘status’ and ‘conduct’ into one catchall protected class \ncovering all conduct correlating to ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity.’” Id. Just because \nBostock prevents firing an employee for being transgender does not mean it requires allowing \ntransgender employees to engage in conduct, such as using the opposite sex’s bathroom, that is \notherwise prohibited. The 2024 Guidance never addresses this Court’s previous opinion. \nThe 2024 Guidance does concede that “Bostock itself” only “concerned allegations of \ndiscriminatory  discharge,”  but  it  then  claims  that  “the  Supreme  Court’s  reasoning  in  the \ndecision … logically extends” to other employment activities, like bathroom and pronoun policies. \nApp.128 at n. 37. Not so.  \nBostock did not prohibit all sex-based distinctions in employment. Bostock repeatedly cited \nthe Court’s earlier decision in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), as \nauthority. Oncale explained that Title VII “does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in \nthe ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite \nsex,” and “requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace.” Id. at 81. \nOncale noted the central concern of Title VII was not every aspect of interaction in the \nworkplace but only “whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or \nconditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.” Id. at 80 (quoting \nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). The Second \nCircuit—in one of the cases consolidated with and affirmed in Bostock—also favorably cites Oncale \nas “arguably” supporting the view that “sex-specific bathroom and grooming policies [do not] \nimpose disadvantageous terms or conditions” because not all distinctions of “‘sexual content or \nconnotations’ rise to the level of discrimination.” Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 119 \n& n.16 (2d Cir. 2018) (en banc) (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79–80)); see also West v. Radtke, 48 \nF.4th 836, 849 (7th Cir. 2022) (finding Title VII would not be violated by preventing transgender \nprison guard from performing strip searches of opposite-sex inmates because it did not constitute \nan adverse employment action). \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 23 of 44     PageID 322\nRelatedly, Bostock also cautioned that “Title VII does not concern itself with everything \nthat happens ‘because of’ sex,” 590 U.S. at 657—only discrimination that is “inextricably” related \nto sex is forbidden; distinctions “related to sex in some vague sense” or having only “some \ndisparate impact on one sex or the other” are not reached by the statute. Id. at 660–61. \nBostock also did not overturn any Supreme Court precedents, instead resting on those \ndating to the 1970s. It also did not disturb lower-court precedent that has long applied those same \nprecedents. “[T]the Court relied in Bostock on the same well established Title VII principles that \nanimated  the  outcome  in  those  prior  decisions  [of  lower  courts  that applied  the  same key \nprecedents, so those courts] effectively anticipated Bostock’s rationale.” Maner v. Dignity Health, \n9 F.4th 1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2021) (Bea, J.) (explaining Bostock did not overturn decades of lower-\ncourt precedents rejecting “paramour preference” theory of liability). \nThis is consistent with Willingham v. Macon Tel. Publ’g Co., 507 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1975) \n(en banc), which upheld sex-specific grooming codes under Title VII. Willingham applied Phillips \nv. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971), one of the key cases the Supreme Court relied on in \nBostock. The Second Circuit in Zarda— which relied on the same key precedents that the Supreme \nCourt would later adopt in Bostock (Martin Marietta and L.A. Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, \n435 U.S. 702 (1978))—favorably cited Willingham as consistent with its analysis, 883 F.3d at 118–\n19. \nIn  short,  Bostock  did  not  nullify  the  Supreme  Court’s  longstanding  acceptance  of \ndifferences between the sexes. It did not question any longstanding precedent beyond the narrow \nquestion  before  it:  whether  “[a]n  employer  who  fires  an  individual  merely  for  being  gay  or \ntransgender defies the law.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 683 (emphasis added). \nIn  fact,  an  employer  that  follows  the  2024  Guidance  will  effectively  provide \naccommodations to transgender-identifying employees. But, as explained next in more detail, Title \nVII does not require accommodations. \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 24 of 44     PageID 323\nB.  Title VII does not require employers to accommodate conduct associated with \ntransgender status. \nThe 2024 Guidance does not challenge employees’ right to have sex-specific dress codes, \nbathrooms, or pronoun-usage policies as a general matter. But it reads Title VII to require \nemployers to accommodate transgender employees by excusing them from longstanding work rules \napplicable to all employees. In particular, the 2024 Guidance requires employers to excuse \nemployees from three rules—that (1) men use the men’s restroom, women use the women’s \nrestroom; (2) men wear professional men’s clothes, women wear professional women’s clothes; \nand (3) men are referred to by masculine pronouns, women are referred to be feminine pronouns—\nwhenever following those rules would subject the employee to practices that conflict with his \ngender identity.  \nThis Court has already concluded that Title VII does not require accommodating conduct \ncorrelated  with  transgender  status  including,  “specifically,  the  sex-specific  (1)  dress;  (2) \nbathroom; [and] (3) pronoun … practices underlying” the 2024 Guidance. Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d \nat 830. For good reason. While federal law requires employers to make reasonable accommodations \nfor conduct associated with an employee’s religion, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j), disability, see id. § \n12131–32, and pregnancy, see id. § 2000gg-1, it does not require accommodations from general \nworkplace rules based on an employee’s sex, let alone on transgender status.  \nBy finding Title VII to prohibit discrimination based on transgender status because it is sex \ndiscrimination, Bostock forbids employers from discriminating against an employee based on that \nindividual’s internal sense of being male or female. See Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 708 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (Williams, J., concurring in the result) (“Transgender individuals have a gender \nidentity—an internalized, felt sense of who they are as male or female—that does not align with \ntheir sex assigned at birth.”) (cleaned up). \nBostock does not allow any expansion of this concept to conduct that may be “associated \nwith” transgender status. Any such conduct would only be “related [to transgender status] in \n‘some vague sense,’” or merely have “some disparate impact” on transgender employees. Bostock, \n17 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 25 of 44     PageID 324\n590 U.S. at 661. Given that many transgender persons make no attempt to socially transition by \nusing bathrooms, pronouns, or dress of the opposite sex, such behavior is not “inextricably” \nrelated to transgender status, and thus not sufficiently related to sex to be reached by Title VII. Id. \nBostock’s treatment of sex discrimination is consistent with longstanding judicial precedent \nrelating to other protected categories in Title VII and other anti-discrimination laws. As a result, \neven if “social transitioning” relating to bathroom usage, pronoun usage, or dress is correlated with \ntransgender status, it is not protected. For example, Title VII permits employers to limit the \nlanguages spoken in the workplace, even though an employee’s native language is closely bound \nup with his national origin and he may have a strong cultural connection with his native language. \nSee, e.g., Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 268 (5th Cir. 1980); Garcia v. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d \n1480, 1489–90 (9th Cir. 1993). \nFor  all  categories in  Title VII (other than religion), courts have repeatedly rejected \nattempts to conflate volitional behavior or attributes that are associated with protected classes. See \nEspinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88, 95 (1973) (rejecting conflation of citizenship or alienage \nstatus with Title VII category of national origin); EEOC v. Catastrophe Mgmt. Sols., 852 F.3d 1018, \n1032 (11th Cir. 2016) (noting “every court to have considered the issue has rejected the argument \nthat Title VII protects hairstyles culturally associated with race”) (collecting cases); In re Union \nPac. R.R. Emp. Pracs. Litig., 479  F.3d 936, 942– 45 (8th Cir. 2007) (rejecting  conflation  of \ncontraception use with Title VII category of sex); cf. Hazen Paper Co., v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 614, \n608–14 (1993) (rejecting conflation of age discrimination under ADEA with seniority or pension \nstatus). \nConsider the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that explicitly added to the definition of \n“because of sex” discrimination to include “because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or \nrelated medical conditions.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-(k). This was adopted after the Supreme Court \nhad held that such discrimination was not covered by the general prohibition on discrimination \n“because of sex” in Title VII. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 136–38 (1976). There is \nno such statute relating to traits or attributes “associated with” transgenderism, so the 2024 \n18 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 26 of 44     PageID 325\nGuidance’s interpretation is doomed by the “Negative–Implication Canon[:] The expression of \none thing implies the exclusion of others (expressio unius est exclusio alterius)”). Scalia & Garner, \nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 107. \nEven if there were a high correlation between (1) particular “gender expression” relating \nto bathrooms, pronoun usage, or dress, and (2) transgender status, even perfect correlation is not \nenough to constitute discrimination. See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, \n2245–46 (2022) (citations omitted).  \nWhile Bostock prohibits an employer from discriminating against employees based on sexual \norientation or gender identity, the employer is not required to treat homosexual or transgender \nemployees more favorably than other employees. See Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 \nU.S. 248, 259 (1981) (employers not required to give preferential treatment to minorities or \nwomen). By requiring employers to make exceptions to concededly lawful policies for practices \n“associated with” a particular gender identity, the 2024 Guidance turned Title VII’s prohibition \non sex discrimination into an accommodation mandate. There is no textual warrant for requiring \naccommodations  for  any  aspect  of  sex  discrimination—unlike,  for  example,  religious \naccommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). The 2024 Guidance did not address discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity as aspects of sex discrimination, as did Bostock. \nInstead,  it  attempted  to  require  employers  to  accommodate  practices  that  are  purportedly \n“associated with” transgender status, even though it is well established that “apply[ing] a neutral, \ngenerally applicable” policy “can, in no way, be said to have been motivated by” a protected \nclassification and constitute illegal disparate treatment. Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 55 \n(2003). \nIt is helpful to see how the Americans with Disabilities Act defines the term:  \nThe term “reasonable accommodation” may include-- \n(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by \nindividuals with disabilities; and \n(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a \nvacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate \n19 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 27 of 44     PageID 326\nadjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the \nprovision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for \nindividuals with disabilities. \n42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). \nThat is exactly what the 2024 Guidance was attempting to do: to require the alteration of \nthe ordinary work rules, facilities, terms, and conditions that apply to all other employees. Cf. Doe \n2, 917 F.3d at 708 (Williams, J., concurring in the result) (describing the requirement that all \nservicemembers serve in their biological sex as “declining to make … accommodations for gender \ntransition,”  rather  than  “a  transgender  ban”).  But  “[f]ailure  to  provide  a  reasonable \naccommodation is a type of unlawful discrimination … not generally applicable to all the protected \nstatus groups under Title VII, and has been reserved to issues of discrimination on the basis of \nreligion and disability.” 1 Barbara T. Lindemann & Paul Grossman, Employment Discrimination \nLaw 265 (4th ed. 2007). \nCompare the 2024 Guidance’s accommodation mandates with Title VII’s well-known \naccommodation requirement for religion. Title VII defines “religion” broadly to include “all \naspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that \nhe is unable to reasonably accommodate an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious \nobservance or practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j) (emphasis added). And Title VII’s accommodation \nrequirement,  unlike  the norm  of neutrality for most anti-discrimination provisions,  requires \npreferential treatment for employees based on religious practices: \nTitle VII does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices—that \nthey be treated no worse than other  practices. Rather, it gives them favored \ntreatment, affirmatively obligating employers not “to fail or refuse to hire or \ndischarge any individual … because of such individual’s” “religious observance \nand practice.” An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear \npolicy as an ordinary matter. But when an applicant requires an accommodation as \nan  “aspec[t]  of  religious  … practice,”  it  is  no  response  that  the  subsequent \n“fail[ure] … to hire” was due to an otherwise-neutral policy. Title VII requires \notherwise-neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation. \nEEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 775 (2015).  \n20 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 28 of 44     PageID 327\nBostock, on the other hand, forbids “favored treatment” based on sexual orientation and \ngender identity, and thus precludes any requirement of accommodation. None of the other Title \nVII protected characteristics require accommodation of employees’ voluntary “observance[s] or \npractice[s],” including dress, bathroom usage, or customized language demands. The religious \naccommodation requirement “reinforce[es] the conclusion that Congress acted deliberately when \nit omitted” any accommodation requirement from the sex discrimination provision in the same \nsection of the statute. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 354 (2013). Indeed, \nCongress has explicitly precluded gender dysphoria or transgender status (or homosexuality) as a \nbasis for an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 12211(a), \n(b)(1). Through the 2024 Guidance, EEOC seeks to overcome Congress’s deliberate choice to not \nrequire accommodations based on these concepts. \nConsider pronouns. Standard English usage is that individual pronouns are based on sex, \nnot gender identity—a usage that existed long before the latter concept existed. EEOC does not \nassert that standard English is forbidden in workplaces in general, but the 2024 Guidance requires \nthat an exception be made when referring to transgender employees. But it is difficult to think of \nanything more of a “genuine but innocuous difference[] in the ways men and women routinely \ninteract with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex,” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81, than the \nstandard use of the English language. \nUnlike with religion, Title VII does not protect “observance[s] or practice[s]” related to \nsexual orientation or gender identity nor require employers to accommodate such volitional \npractices—transgender status or homosexual status alone are protected. “[T]there is nothing in \nTitle VII which requires an employer to allow employees to express their cultural identity.” Spun \nSteak Co., 998 F.2d at 1487. \nDefendants have previously attempted to distinguish the 2024 Guidance from the 2021 \nGuidance on the theory that the 2024 Guidance supposedly allows refusals to accommodate to be \nused only as evidence of status-based discrimination. But that view is belied by the 2024 Guidance \nitself,  which  says  that  “[h]arassing  conduct  based  on  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity \n21 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 29 of 44     PageID 328\nincludes” conduct against employees not “present[ing] in a manner that would stereotypically be \nassociated with that person’s sex,” App.035, or “denial of access to a bathroom or other sex-\nsegregated  facility  consistent  with  [an]  individual’s  gender identity,”  id.,  or  “repeated  and \nintentional use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with [an] individual’s known gender identity \n(misgendering).” Id. The 2024 Guidance thus imposes the same kinds of bathroom, dress code, \nand pronoun rules that the 2021 Guidance did. \nC. Regardless,  sex-segregated  bathrooms,  dress  codes,  and  pronouns  are  not \ndiscriminatory. \nTitle VII only prohibits sex-based discrimination. Workplace harassment, the purported \nsubject of the 2024 Guidance, only violates Title VII if it exposes “members of one sex … to \ndisadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not \nexposed.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80 (quotation omitted). To discriminate in violation of Title VII, an \nemployer must “intentionally treat[] a person worse because of sex—such as by firing the person \nfor actions or attributes it would tolerate in an individual of another sex.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 658.  \nBut maintaining sex-segregated bathrooms, dress codes, and pronoun usage does not treat \ntransgender individuals worse than others because of sex; it treats similarly situated individuals the \nsame regardless of any gender identity: all men must use male facilities, and all women must use \nfemale facilities, and all facilities are generally equal. Similarly, all men must wear male clothing \nand be called by masculine pronouns, and all women must wear female clothing and be called by \nfeminine pronouns. And while these policies do classify based on sex, those classifications simply \nreflect the “genuine but innocuous differences” between the sexes without preferencing one sex \nor distinguishing between members of the same sex. Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81. The 2024 Guidance \nexceeds  Title  VII  by  announcing  that  employers  can  face  liability  even  when  they  do  not \ndiscriminate on the basis of sex.  \nThe implications of EEOC’s unlawful power grab are far-reaching. Commissioner Lucas \nissued a statement warning that the 2024 Guidance “effectively eliminates single-sex workplace \nfacilities and impinges on women’s (and indeed, all employees’) rights to freedom of speech and \n22 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 30 of 44     PageID 329\nbelief.” App.208. She explained that “[i]t is not harassment to acknowledge” biological sex or the \n“enduring” differences between men and women. Id. (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. \n515, 533 (1996) (Ginsburg, J.)). She also rejected the 2024 Guidance’s conclusion that Bostock \nforbids  businesses  from  “draw[ing]  distinctions  between  the  sexes  in  providing  single-sex \nbathrooms or other similar facilities which implicate … significant privacy and safety interests.” \nId. She argued that maintaining sex-segregated spaces has historically been viewed as “exercising \nreasonable care to prevent harassment of female workers,” but the 2024 Guidance now treats this \n“reasonable and necessary step to protect women” as “evidence of harassment against any \nbiological male who self-identifies as having a female ‘gender identity.’” Id. (emphases in original). \nBostock itself cautioned that:  \nAs sweeping as even the but-for causation standard can be, Title VII does not \nconcern itself with everything that happens “because of” sex. The statute imposes \nliability on employers only when they “fail or refuse to hire,” “discharge,” “or \notherwise … discriminate against” someone because of a statutorily protected \ncharacteristic like sex.  \nBostock, 590  U.S. at  657.  To  “discriminate against”  a person “mean[s] mean treating that \nindividual worse than others who are similarly situated,” and “the difference in treatment based \non sex must be intentional.” Id.  \nJustice Gorsuch’s concurring opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights \nComm’n, 584 U.S. 617, 643–54 (2018), illuminates what he means by this in Bostock. There, he \nreasoned that Jack Phillips had no intent to discriminate based on sexual orientation when he \nrefused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. Id. at 644–48 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Justice \nGorsuch noted a distinction between the foreseeable effects of Mr. Phillips’ conduct on the same-\nsex couple and “actual proof of intent to discriminate on the basis of membership in a protected \nclass.” Id. at 648. Bostock, of course, notes that Title VII requires actual intent to discriminate. \nJustice Gorsuch also previews his use of “inextricably tied” to a protected trait to describe conduct \n23 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 31 of 44     PageID 330\ntowards a protected class,1 id. at 647–48, a test which he finds Mr. Phillips’s actions did not meet \nand thus did not constitute discrimination based on a protected characteristic. Id. at 646 (“But \nthere’s no indication the bakers actually intended to refuse service because of a customer’s protected \ncharacteristic”) (emphases in original). This illustrates the status-conduct distinction that would \ncome later in Bostock.  \nBostock’s analysis with respect to employment termination does not extend to decisions \nconcerning bathrooms. Discrimination requires treating certain individuals “worse than others \nwho are similarly situated.” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 657. Providing separate but “comparable,” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.33, restrooms for the different sexes does not treat members of one sex worse than \nmembers of the other sex. Counsel for the plaintiffs in Bostock agreed, stating at oral argument that \nsex-separated  bathrooms  are  “not  discriminatory  because”  no  one  is  “subjected  to  a \ndisadvantage.” Tr. of Oral Arg. at 12-13, Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644 (2020) (Nos. 17-\n1618, 17-1623); see also Reply Br. for Resp’ts at 19-21, Altitude Express, Inc. v.

While “[a]n \nindividual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions” about \nhiring and firing, Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660 (emphasis added), sex is relevant in contexts such as \nbathrooms where physiological differences between the sexes matter. “A sign that says ‘men only’ \nlooks very different on a bathroom door than a courthouse door.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \n \n \n1 Compare Justice Gorsuch’s use of this phrase with “inextricably bound up with sex” to \ndescribe the traits protected from intentional discrimination in Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660–61. \n24 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 32 of 44     PageID 331\nLiving Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 468-69 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment in part and \ndissenting in part); see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996) (admitting \nwomen to the Virginia Military Institute “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to \nafford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements”).  \nAs to pronoun usage, the 2024 Guidance did not mandate that employers use a gender-\nneutral (but awkward and confusing) “they” at all times in the workplace. As Defendants don’t \nthink biologically based pronoun usage is inherently discriminatory, it cannot constitute harassing \nbehavior. See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25 (1993) (“When the workplace is permeated \nwith “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult” Title VII is violated) (citation omitted). \nD. EEOC’s other authorities do not justify the 2024 Guidance. \nIn addition, EEOC points to its own “federal sector cases,” where the Commission has \n“concluded that sex-based harassment includes harassment based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.” App.128–29 at n.37 (citing Lusardi v. Dep’t of the Army, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133395, \n2015 WL 1607756, at *10–13 (Apr. 1, 2015) and Baldwin v. Dep’t of Transp., EEOC Appeal No. \n0120133080, 2015 WL 4397641, at *5, *10 (July 15, 2015)). “But these decisions are irrelevant \nbecause they interpret Title VII provisions applicable to federal employers—not private-sector and \nstate employers.” Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 836; compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (declaring it \nunlawful for private-sector and state employers to “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any \nindividual,  or  otherwise  to  discriminate  against  any  individual … because  of  such \nindividual’s … sex”), with 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a) (“All personnel actions affecting employees \nor applicants for employment … shall be made free from any discrimination based on … sex … .”). \nEEOC also invokes a handful of nonbinding cases. App.128–131 at nn.37-43. But those cases \ndo not move the ball. For instance, consider Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, LLC, 472 F. Supp. 3d 115 \n(E.D. Pa. 2020). There, the district court merely held that the plaintiff’s alleged pattern of \nharassment stated a claim for a hostile work environment under Title VII. Id. at 129–30. Although \nso-called “misgendering” and bathroom use were among the many allegations of harassment, it is \n25 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 33 of 44     PageID 332\nnot clear that those allegations governed the court’s determination that the complaint there stated \na claim under Title VII. See id. The same is true of Eller v. Prince George’s County Public Schools, \nwhere the alleged harassment also included comments that were “explicitly sexual in nature,” like \nthreats of “rape.” 580 F. Supp. 3d 154, 172 (D. Md. 2022). The decision in Tudor v. Southeastern \nOklahoma State Univ., Case No. CIV-15-324, 2017 WL 4849118, at *1 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 26, 2017), \nis of a piece. The court in Tudor noted long-standing restrictions on bathroom use and extensive \n“misgendering” among multiple factors by which it determined a jury could find harassment. 2017 \nWL 4849118, at *1. But that theory was ultimately rejected by a jury. See Tudor v. Southeastern \nOklahoma State Univ., 13 F.4th 1019, 1027 (10th Cir. 2021). \n*   *   * \nThe Court should declare the 2024 Guidance unlawful, vacate it, and enjoin Defendants \nfrom implementing it and the interpretation of Title VII it implements. \nIII.  The 2024 Guidance is arbitrary and capricious. \nThe APA instructs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n“The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be reasonable and \nreasonably explained.” FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021). Agency action \nruns afoul of this standard when the agency “entirely fails to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983). The 2024 Guidance failed to address three important factors: women’s safety, the \ndifficulty of implementing EEOC’s scheme, and federalism concerns. \nA. EEOC failed to consider women’s safety. \nSociety has long recognized the need for sex-segregated restrooms to protect women from \nsexual harassment and sexual assault. See generally W. Burlette Carter, Sexisim in the “Bathroom \nDebates”: How Bathrooms Really Became Separated by Sex, 37 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 227 (2018). \nUnsurprisingly, the Supreme Court recognized the need for—and lawfulness of—sex-segregated \n26 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 34 of 44     PageID 333\n“living arrangements” to protect women’s “privacy” too. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, \n550 n.19 (1996); see also Faulkner v. Jones, 10 F.3d 226, 232 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting “society’s \nundisputed  approval  of  separate  public  rest  rooms  for  men  and  women  based  on  privacy \nconcerns”). \nUnfortunately, the country has been reminded of the need for sex-segregated bathrooms in \nrecent years. At least one study has found a link between policies that permit transgender \nindividuals to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity are linked to sexual incidents, \nin particular voyeurism-related offenses.

And central to the nationwide debate over gender identity and \nbathroom policies has been whether and to what extent women are put at risk by permitting men \nwho identify as women to use women’s intimate spaces. \nYet, EEOC never even addressed this important consideration—the risk to women’s \nsafety—in its 2024 Guidance. That failure alone justifies setting aside the 2024 Guidance as \narbitrary and capricious. See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  This failure is even more damning in view \nof a comment letter signed by the Texas Attorney General and 19 other States that raised this exact \nconcern to EEOC. States’ Comment Letter at 9–10, App.013–14. EEOC has no excuse for failing \nto address this “important aspect of the problem.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nRelatedly, EEOC never considered that the 2024 Guidance could potentially expose \nemployers to even further Title VII liability when female employees suffer harassment at work \nfrom men entering their restrooms and locker rooms.  \nB.  EEOC failed to consider implementation burdens. \nTo comply with the 2024 Guidance, employers must ascertain their employees’ gender \nidentity. Only by doing so can the employer ensure that its employees are referred to by pronouns \nthat correspond to their gender identity and are permitted to dress and use restrooms that \ncorrespond to their gender identity.  \n27 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 35 of 44     PageID 334\nBut that creates a serious implementation hurdle. It is often difficult for employers to tell \nthe gender identity of their employees. As one advocacy group put it, “[t]here is no way to \ndetermine if someone  is  transgender or non-binary unless they share their personal gender \nidentity.”  Human  Rights  Campaign,  Transgender  and  Non-Binary  People  FAQ, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5f9jvs4c. Even then, gender identity is not fixed, as some individuals may \n“embrace a fluidity of gender identity,” or “may identify as being both a man and a woman, \nsomewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories.” See, e.g., HRC Glossary, \nhttps://perma.cc/4UYM-ZW3Q. According to those on the cutting edge of transgender theory, \nthere are some 80 types of genders and gender identities, ranging from “aliagender” to “bigender” \nto “demiboy” to “genderqueer” to “transfeminine” and many more. Chris Drew, 81 Types of \nGenders  &  Gender  Identities  (A  to  Z  List),  HELPFULPROFESSOR.COM  (Mar.  26,  2022), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc3xajrj.  Yet,  the  2024  Guidance  makes  employers  responsible  for \ndetermining and then monitoring the gender identities of their employees, so that the employer \ncan accommodate the conduct associated with those gender identities. \nThe 2024 Guidance never gave employers any guidance on how to do this, and indeed, \nnever considered this important aspect of the problem. Once again, this concern had been pointed \nout in comments, States’ Comment Letter at 10–11, App.014–15—yet EEOC pressed on without \neven addressing it. This provides an additional basis for setting aside the 2024 Guidance. \nC. EEOC failed to consider effects on federalism. \nThe 2024 Guidance has several clear implications for federalism. For one, numerous state \nand local government agencies and departments have 15 or more employees, and therefore are \ndirectly affected by Title VII. For another, a number of States—including Texas, see Miller Decl \npassim, App.210–14—have laws or policies that the 2024 Guidance purports to preempt. For \nexample, many States have laws requiring sex-segregated bathrooms. See, e.g., Tennessee, 615 F. \nSupp. 3d at 823 n.9 (noting laws in Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia); Ark. \nCode Ann. § 6-21-120; Idaho Code Ann. § 33-6601, et seq.  \n28 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 36 of 44     PageID 335\nThe effects of the 2024 Guidance on federalism should have been a significant factor in the \ndecision-making process. Indeed, Executive Order 13,132 requires agencies to consider the impacts \nof their actions on federalism. Yet, EEOC never considered federalism, despite the States raising \nthis issue in a comment. States’ Comment Letter at 12, App.016. \nIV.  The 2024 Guidance is an invalid substantive rule. \nThe Fifth Circuit has held that EEOC “has limited rulemaking and enforcement power \nwith respect to Title VII [and] may issue only ‘procedural regulations’ implementing Title VII and \nmay not promulgate substantive rules.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 439 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n12(a)). “Substantive” or “legislative rules” are rules that have the “force and effect of law.” Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015). Echoing the “final agency action” inquiry, courts \nmust consider “whether the rule (1) imposes any rights and obligations and (2) genuinely leaves \nthe agency and its decision-makers free to exercise discretion,” Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 171 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal marks omitted). \nThe 2024 Guidance, like the 2021 Guidance, satisfies both prongs. First, it creates “new \nduties” by altering employers’ obligations under Title VII and “impos[ing] dress-code, bathroom, \nand pronoun accommodations” that Title VII does not require, just like the 2021 Guidance did. \nId.; see also Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 832. Second, the 2024 Guidance “binds agency staff and \nthe public because of its mandatory language.” Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 840. \nBecause “EEOC is not authorized to promulgate substantive rules to implement Title \nVII,” EEOC, 933 F.3d at 450, the 2024 Guidance is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nV.  The 2024 Guidance was required to be published in the Federal Register. \nThe Freedom of Information Act requires that agencies publish “substantive rules of \ngeneral applicability” and “statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability” \nin the Federal Register. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D). The 2024 Guidance was never published in the \nFederal Register. \n29 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 37 of 44     PageID 336\nAs already established, the 2024 Guidance imposes rights and obligations and binds agency \nactors and is therefore a substantive rule. See Texas, 809 F.3d at 151–155. One reason the APA was \nadopted was “to avoid the inherently arbitrary nature of unpublished ad hoc determinations.” \nMorton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 (1974). To further advance that interest, FOIA requires that \n“substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law” be published in the \nFederal Register. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D). But it goes further, even making “statements of general \npolicy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency”—and no \none could dispute that the 2024 Guidance is at least a statement of that kind —subject to the \npublication requirement. Id.  \nThere is no dispute that EEOC never published the 2024 Guidance in the Federal Register. \nBy violating FOIA’s publication requirement, the agencies have violated the APA’s ban on agency \naction taken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). This \nCourt previously held the 2021 Guidance was unlawful for the same reason. See Texas, 633 \nF.Supp.3d at 842.  \nVI.  The Court should issue declaratory relief. \nThe Declaratory Judgment Act allows courts to “declare the rights and other legal relations \nof any interested party.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201. “The existence of another adequate remedy does not \npreclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. The APA ex-\npressly contemplates declaratory relief: “The form of proceeding for judicial review … includ[es] \nactions for declaratory judgments or writs of prohibitory or mandatory injunction[.]” 5 U.S.C. § \n703. \nVII.  The Court should vacate the 2024 Guidance. \n“[V]acatur of an agency action is the default rule in this Circuit.” Cargill v. Garland, 57 \nF.4th 447, 472 (5th Cir. 2023) (en banc). Indeed, “[v]acatur is the only statutorily prescribed \nremedy for a successful APA challenge to a regulation.” Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Becerra, 47 \nF.4th 368, 374–75 (5th Cir. 2022). The Fifth Circuit does not “require consideration of the various \n30 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 38 of 44     PageID 337\nequities at stake before determining whether a party is entitled to vacatur” because “Section 706, \nafter all, provides that a reviewing court shall set aside unlawful agency action.” Braidwood Mgmt., \nInc. v. Becerra, 104 F.4th 930, 952 (5th Cir. 2024). \nVIII.  The Court should issue permanent injunctive relief. \nA permanent injunction is proper when a plaintiff has prevailed on the merits, there is no \nadequate remedy at law for the plaintiff’s injury, the balance of the harms favors the plaintiff, and \nan injunction would serve the public interest. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 \n(2006). “[T]he standard for a permanent injunction is essentially the same as for a preliminary \ninjunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits.” Dresser-\nRand Co. v. Virtual Automation, Inc., 361 F.3d 831, 847–48 (5th Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs have satisfied \neach of these elements.  \nA. Plaintiffs succeed on the merits. \nAs explained above, the 2024 Guidance is unlawful. \nB.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm. \nNot only is the 2024 Guidance unlawful, but it also will impose irreparable harm on \nPlaintiffs. Generally, it is “well established that an injury is irreparable only ‘if it cannot be undone \nthrough monetary remedies.’” Dennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 279 (5th \nCir. 2012) (quoting Interox Am. v. PPG Indus., Inc., 736 F.2d 194, 202 (5th Cir. 1984)).  \n“Whether someone is an object of a regulation is a flexible inquiry rooted in common \nsense.” Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). “That common sense \ninquiry  is  easy  here  [because  the  2024  Guidance]  explicitly  states  that  it  applies  to  state \nemployers[;] … [t]hus, by its own terms, the [2024 Guidance] covers Texas.” Id.; see App.025, \n119 n.4. The 2024 Guidance is aimed squarely at Plaintiffs and other employers with workplace \npolicies based on biological sex rather than gender identity. Defendants cannot now pretend that \nthey have no consequences, and that Plaintiffs are unaffected by them. \n31 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 39 of 44     PageID 338\nFirst, Plaintiffs would suffer the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs. \nCareer Colleges & Sch. of Texas v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 235 (5th Cir. 2024); \n“[C]omplying with a regulation later held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of \nnonrecoverable compliance costs.” Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting \nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220–21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in \nthe judgment)).  \nA  critical  factor  in  assessing  both  hostile-work-environment  claims,  generally,  and \nemployers’ vicarious Title VII liability, in particular, is whether the employer has adequate training \nmaterials and procedures for reporting unlawful harassment. See, e.g., Faragher v. City of Boca \nRaton, 524 U.S. 775, 806–09 (1998). Plaintiffs therefore will need to review discrimination policies, \nrevise and reissue policies that conflict with the 2024 Guidance, draft new policies, and develop \nand distribute training and educational materials for supervisors and employees. See Miller Decl. \n¶¶ Miller Decl. ¶¶ 10–13, App.212. And Heritage would have to develop new materials and \ntraining programs to reflect the 2024 Guidance’s policy changes; Korsvall Decl. ¶¶ 6–910, \nApp.217–18. \nTexas has shown imminent injury because it “has opted to express certain values [in its \nworkplace policies] and the [2024 Guidance] imposes a regulatory burden on Texas to comply with \n[them] to avoid enforcement actions and, consequently, pressures it to abandon its laws and \npolicies.” Id.; see also Texas v. EEOC, 827 F.3d 372, 379 (5th Cir. 2016) (injury-in-fact requirement \nsatisfied where “the Guidance does, at the very least, force Texas to undergo an analysis, agency \nby  agency,  regarding  whether  the  certainty  of  EEOC  investigations  stemming  from  the \nEnforcement Guidance’s standards overrides the State’s interest in not hiring felons for certain \njobs”). The same is true for the burden on Heritage. \nSecond,  on  top  of  unrecoverable  compliance  costs,  EEOC’s  gender-identity-\naccommodation mandate fundamentally infringes on the sovereignty of Texas. See ECF No. 53, \nOrder at 18–19 (discussing harms to Texas sovereignty from 2021 Guidance). The 2024 Guidance \nstrips Texas of its sovereign interest and ability to create and enforce its own laws and policies. \n32 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 40 of 44     PageID 339\nTexas’s “inability to enforce its duly enacted” laws “inflicts irreparable harm on the State.” \nAbbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018); see also, e.g., Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d \n1213, 1227 (10th Cir. 2001) (irreparable harm where agency action put its “sovereign interests and \npublic policies at stake”); see also Bowen v. Pub. Agencies Opposed to Soc. Sec. Entrapment, 477 U.S. \n41, 50 & n.17 (1986) (finding “no question” that a state’s sovereignty is “diminished” and \nstanding therefore exists when federal law alters the state’s ability to “structure its relationship \nwith its employees”) (cleaned up). \nTexas  has  employment  policies  that  are  not  consistent  with  the  2024  Guidance’s \nbathroom, dress code, and pronoun requirements.  See Miller Decl. passim, App.210–214. Because \nit is the object of the mandates in the 2024 Guidance, Texas suffers an increased regulatory burden \nbecause “it deems unlawful” its current workplace policies and “warns the [S]tate that … it will \nbe able to show that its current policies … are lawful under Title VII only if it abandons those \npolicies.” EEOC, 933 F.3d at 447. “Texas [thus] faces the possibility of investigation by EEOC \nand referral to the Attorney General for enforcement proceedings if it fails to align its laws with the \n[2024 Guidance].” Id. \nHere, Plaintiffs suffer both substantial financial injuries and injuries that cannot be undone \nthrough  monetary  means.  As  discussed  above,  an  injury  to  Texas’s  sovereign  interests  is \nirreparable. Moreover, because the federal government “generally enjoy[s] sovereign immunity \nfor any monetary damages,” Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. FDA, 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 (5th \nCir. 2021), Plaintiffs cannot compel the federal government to reimburse them for any harms. \nTogether, therefore, the injuries to Plaintiffs’ financial—and Texas’s sovereign—interests \nare irreparable and should be protected with a permanent injunction. \nC. The balance of equities and public interest favor an injunction. \nFinally, the remaining injunction factors—the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest—tilt in Plaintiffs’ favor. These two considerations “merge when the Government is the \nopposing party,” as is the case here. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). While the \n33 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 41 of 44     PageID 340\nDefendants may contend that eliminating discrimination is in the public interest, any such claimed \ninterest in carrying out the 2024 Guidance is “illegitimate,” as the federal government has no \ninterest “in enforcing an unlawful” agency action. BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604, \n618 (5th Cir. 2021).  \nFor the reasons given above, Plaintiffs succeeded on the merits and confront substantial, \nimminent irreparable harm—the two most important factors in the analysis for injunctive relief. \nSee Career Colleges & Sch. of Texas., 98 F.4th at 239 (likelihood of success on the merits in similar \npreliminary-injunction context); see also Mock v. Garland, 75 F.4th 563, 587 n.60 (5th Cir. 2023) \n(same); Spectrum WT v. Wendler, 693 F.Supp.3d 689, 711 (N.D. Tex. 2023) (Kacsmaryk, J.) \n(irreparable harm). The EEOC Defendants thus “face[] a high hurdle” in establishing that the \nremaining two factors weigh against granting relief. Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th Cir. \n2023). Granting a permanent injunction would serve the public interest by ensuring that Texas and \nHeritage may continue to enforce their laws and policies without risking enforcement by EEOC. \nRedressing Plaintiffs’ injuries serves the public interest and does not harm the Defendants. \nAccordingly, the balance of equities and the public interest weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. \nD. The scope of injunctive relief properly extends beyond the 2024 Guidance. \nThe Court should issue permanent injunctive relief against the Defendants—enjoining not \nonly enforcement of the 2024 Guidance, but also preventing them from interpreting, applying, or \nenforcing (including by denying federal financial assistance or by otherwise pursuing, charging, or \nassessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or other enforcement actions) the \nprovision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applicable to private and State employers, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), as requiring Plaintiffs to allow employees to: comply with dress or \ngrooming policies based on gender identity rather than biological sex; or use bathrooms, locker \nrooms, or showers based on gender identity rather than biological sex; or demand that they be \nreferred to by pronouns, names, titles, or honorifics based on gender identity rather than biological \nsex.  \n34 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 42 of 44     PageID 341\nThe Court should also enjoin the Defendants from relying on decisions of the Commission \napplying the provision of Title VII applicable to federal employers, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a), to \npursue, charge, or assess any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or other enforcement \nactions (including by denying federal financial assistance) against Plaintiffs. \nThis broader relief against interpreting Title VII in a way that contradicts the statute is \nappropriate.  The Fifth  Circuit  has  termed a “false dichotomy” the notion that “a lawsuit \nchallenging a regulation and a lawsuit challenging the underlying statute are different.” Franciscan \nAll., Inc. v. Becerra, 47 F.4th 368, 378 (5th Cir. 2022). This is because “a challenge to an agency \nregulation is necessarily a challenge to the underlying statute as well[] … because an agency \nliterally  has  no  power  to  act—including  under  its  regulations—unless  and  until  Congress \nauthorizes it to do so by statute.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). As a result, any argument \nagainst this relief “rests on the faulty premise that [Plaintiffs were] ‘suing’ a regulation” as \nopposed to “the right way to view [this] suit [] as challenging ‘one Government action that causes \ntheir  harm:  the  [EEOC’s]  threatened  enforcement  of  [Title  VII], through its  implementing \nregulation.’” Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting FEC v. Cruz, 142 S. Ct. 1638, 1650 (2022)). \nSeveral cases within the Northern District of Texas illustrate the propriety of such relief \nagainst an agency interpreting a statute in a way contrary to law. In a previous challenge to the \nDepartment of Education’s issuance of a guidance document on this subject, Judge O’Connor \ngranted injunctive relief against the Department interpreting Title IX as including discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity: \nDefendants are enjoined from enforcing the Guidelines against Plaintiffs and their \nrespective  schools,  school  boards,  and  other  public,  educationally-based \ninstitutions.  Further,  while  this  injunction  remains  in  place,  Defendants  are \nenjoined from initiating, continuing, or concluding any investigation based on \nDefendants’ interpretation that the definition of sex includes gender identity in \nTitle IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. Additionally, \nDefendants are enjoined from using the Guidelines or asserting the Guidelines carry \nweight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order.  \n35 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 43 of 44     PageID 342\nTexas v. United States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 836 (N.D. Tex. 2016). Similarly, Judge O’Connor \ngranted injunctive relief against the Department of Health and Human Services interpreting a \nprovision of the Affordable Care Act in this way: \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for a permanent \ninjunction  and  PERMANENTLY  ENJOINS  HHS,  Secretary  Becerra,  their \ndivisions, bureaus, agents, officers, commissioners, employees, and anyone acting \nin concert or participation with them, including their successors in office, from \ninterpreting or enforcing Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n18116(a), or any implementing regulations thereto against Plaintiffs, their current \nand future members,  and  those  acting in  concert or participation with them, \nincluding  their  respective  health  plans  and  any  insurers  or  third-party \nadministrators in connection with such health plans, in a manner that would require \nthem to perform or provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures or \nabortions, including by denying Federal financial assistance because of their failure \nto perform or provide insurance coverage for such procedures or by otherwise \npursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or \nother enforcement actions. \nFranciscan All., Inc. v. Becerra, 553 F. Supp. 3d 361, 378 (N.D. Tex. 2021), and aff’d in relevant part, \n47 F.4th 368 (5th Cir. 2022); see also Religious Sisters of Mercy v. Azar, 513 F. Supp. 3d 1113, 1153–\n54 (D.N.D. 2021), aff’d in relevant part, remanded in part sub nom. Religious Sisters of Mercy v. \nBecerra,  55  F.4th  583  (8th  Cir.  2022)  (applying  similar  scope  of  injunctive  relief  against \ninterpretation of Title VII). Most recently, Judge O’Connor entered a similar scope of injunctive \nrelief against any future attempt to apply Bostock to Title IX. See Texas v. Cardona, ---F.Supp.3d---\n, No. 4:23-cv-606, 2024 WL 3658767, *52 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 5, 2024), appeal filed, No. 24-10910 \n(5th Cir. Oct. 7, 2024). \nThe harm done to Plaintiffs arises from the Defendants’ wrongful interpretation and \napplication of Title VII.  The Court should grant full relief by enjoining such actions, whether \nthrough the specific challenged guidance document or otherwise. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should declare that the 2024 Guidance is unlawful; \nvacate it and set aside; and issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the EEOC from enforcing or \ninterpreting Title VII as requiring acommodations based on gender identity. \n36 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 30     Filed 10/23/24      Page 44 of 44     PageID 343\nDated: October 23, 2024  Respectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON  DANIEL D.

The Guidance summarizes the relevant standards applicable to harassment claims \narising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and other statutes, with citations to relevant authority.  \nAs such, it covers myriad topics that might arise in connection with such a claim, and provides \nexamples in order to demonstrate how the EEOC and courts analyze whether harassment is based on \na protected status, when that harassment may rise to a sufficiently severe or pervasive level to affect \nemployment, and the circumstances in which an employer may be held liable depending on the \nparticular facts and circumstances at hand, among other issues.  As the Guidance itself makes plain, it \nis not a legally operative document.  It creates no legal obligations and does not bind the public or \nEEOC staff to a specific outcome in any given charge. \nPlaintiffs the State of Texas and the Heritage Foundation (“Heritage”) apparently take no issue \nwith the majority of the Guidance.  The small portion of the Guidance that Plaintiffs challenge \nexpresses the EEOC’s view, consistent with relevant case law cited therein, that Title VII’s prohibition \nagainst sex discrimination extends to claims of unlawful harassment based on transgender status.  On \nPlaintiffs’ view, the Guidance is no different than a Technical Assistance document this Court vacated \nin a 2022 opinion.  That challenge, however, rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the \nGuidance says.  The challenged portion of the Guidance does not state that any specific employment \npractice related to dress codes, pronouns, or sex-separated bathrooms is per se unlawful under Title \nVII, which differentiates it from this Court’s analysis of the Technical Assistance document.  Rather, \nthe Guidance merely summarizes the types of conduct courts have found may contribute to a hostile \nwork environment in particular circumstances, which may create Title VII liability when other factors \nare met.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 11 of 47     PageID 583\n   \n \nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment should be denied, and Defendants’ cross-motion for \nsummary judgment should be granted.  As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a pre-\nenforcement challenge to the Guidance, and their claim is unripe.  Plaintiffs fail to establish that the \nGuidance causes them any injury because the Guidance does not require or prohibit any specific \nconduct.  Plaintiffs have not established that they maintain employment policies that would give rise \nto liability under the standards summarized in the Guidance.  Plaintiffs also do not establish that the \nGuidance imposes any implementation costs, and the Guidance does not conflict with any Texas law \nthat Plaintiffs invoke in their effort to establish a sovereign injury.  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ claims are \nunripe,  because  they  have  identified  only  purported  fears  of  hypothetical  federal  government \nenforcement against them in the future.  As the Guidance makes explicit, any assessment of a gender \nidentity harassment charge is necessarily fact-specific, and therefore any charge against Plaintiffs would \ndepend on facts that have not materialized (and may never materialize).  Even if they had standing, \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable because the Guidance is not final agency action under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \nEven if Plaintiffs’ claims could proceed, they fail on the merits.  First, the Guidance is a correct \nstatement of the law.  It explains that harassing conduct based on an employee’s gender identity may \ncontribute to a hostile work environment based on sex under Title VII if other factors are met.  \nSecond, the Guidance was well within the EEOC’s authority.  It is at most an interpretive rule that is \nconsistent with the EEOC’s long-recognized authority to issue guidance expressing its views on Title \nVII.  Because the challenged portion of the Guidance is merely a summary of the agency’s view of \nTitle VII, supported by the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020) \nand other relevant case law, Plaintiffs’ arguments that the document is arbitrary and capricious and \nrequired publication in the Federal Register necessarily fail.  Summary judgment should be granted to \nthe Defendants. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 12 of 47     PageID 584\n   \n \nIn the event that the Court disagrees, however, Plaintiffs do not establish that they are entitled \nto the expansive relief they seek.  Rather, consistent with traditional equitable principles and Fifth \nCircuit precedent, any relief should be limited in scope to any party that has established standing and \nto any portion of the Guidance that the Court concludes is unlawful.   \nBACKGROUND \nI.  STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from “discriminat[ing] against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s . . . sex.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).  Harassment based on sex may give \nrise to Title VII liability.  A plaintiff seeking to establish such must prove either that acceptance or \nrejection of the harassment resulted in a tangible employment action or that the harassment created a \nhostile work environment.  Wallace v. Performance Contractors, Inc., 57 F.4th 209, 220–21 (5th Cir. 2023).  \nTo prevail on a hostile work environment claim, plaintiffs must prove not only that they were \nsubjected to harassment, but also that “the harassment was based on a protected characteristic” and \n“affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment.”  EEOC v. Boh Bros. Constr. Co., 731 F.3d 444, \n453 (5th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (cleaned up).  “To affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment, \nthe harassing conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment.”  Id. (cleaned up).  Courts in this circuit “use \nan objective ‘reasonable person’ standard to evaluate severity and pervasiveness.”  Id. (citation \nomitted).  As those tests suggest, hostile work environment claims “depend[] on the totality of \ncircumstances” and require a fact-specific analysis.  Id.  And even then, an employer’s liability depends \non the status of the harasser and, if the harasser was a co-worker or other third party, whether the \nemployer “was negligent in controlling working conditions” or, if the harasser was a supervisor, \nwhether the employer “exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any harassing behavior” and \nwhether  the  plaintiff  “unreasonably  failed  to  take  advantage  of  the  preventive  or  corrective \nopportunities that the employer provided.”  Id. at 452 (citation omitted).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 13 of 47     PageID 585\n   \n \nThe EEOC is tasked with implementing Title VII.  Individuals who believe their rights have \nbeen violated under Title VII must first file a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC within a \nstatutorily defined time from the alleged unlawful practice. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b).  The EEOC \nnotifies the employer of the charge within ten days, investigates the charge—which may include \nsoliciting a position statement from the employer—and then determines whether “reasonable cause” \nexists to believe discrimination occurred.  Id.  If the EEOC does not find “reasonable cause” or \ndetermines that a defense applies, the charge is dismissed, and the employee may file suit within 90 \ndays of receiving a Notice of Right to Sue.  Id. at § 2000e-5(b), (f)(1).  If reasonable causes exists, the \nEEOC will attempt to conciliate the charge; if conciliation fails, the EEOC will either file suit against \nthe employer or inform the charging party they may bring suit.  The process is generally the same for \nState employers, except, if conciliation fails, the EEOC refers the matter to the Department of Justice \n(“DOJ”) to make its own determination whether to file suit or issue a notice of right to sue.  A civil \naction filed by the EEOC, a charging party, or the DOJ is a de novo proceeding, see McDonnell Douglas \nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 799 (1973), and any relief due the aggrieved person can be awarded only \nby the court. \nII.  THE 2021 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DOCUMENT \nIn 2021, the EEOC published a ten-page Technical Assistance document that “briefly \nexplain[ed] what the Bostock decision means for LGBTQ+ workers (and all covered workers) and for \nemployers across the country.”  EEOC, Protections Against Employment Discrimination Based on Sexual \nOrientation or Gender Identity 2 (June 15, 2021), https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/protections-\nagainst-employment-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-or-gender  (“Technical  Assistance \ndocument”).  As relevant here, the Technical Assistance document stated: “May a covered employer \nrequire a transgender employee to dress in accordance with the employee’s sex assigned at birth? No”; \n“[I]f an employer has separate bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers for men and women, all men \n(including transgender men) should be allowed to use the men’s facilities and all women (including \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 14 of 47     PageID 586\n   \n \ntransgender women) should be allowed to use the women’s facilities”; and “Could use of pronouns \nor names that are inconsistent with an individual’s gender identity be considered harassment?  Yes, in \ncertain circumstances.”  Id. at 6–7. \n  Texas challenged the Technical Assistance document in this Court.  See Texas v. EEOC, No. \n2:21-CV-194-Z  (N.D.  Tex.).    This  Court  concluded  that  Texas  had  standing  to  challenge  the \nGuidance;  that  the  Guidance  was  final  agency  action  because  it  \n“use[d] mandatory language” and “create[d] safe harbors”; and that the substance of the Technical \nAssistance document was inconsistent with Bostock, although it was not arbitrary and capricious.   Texas \nv. EEOC, No. 2:21-CV-194-Z, 2022 WL 22869778, at *5–6, *8–12 (N.D. Tex. May 26, 2022); Texas \nv. EEOC, 633 F. Supp. 3d 824, 829–38 (N.D. Tex. 2022).  Accordingly, the Court declared the \nTechnical Assistance document unlawful and set it aside universally.  Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 845–\n47. \nIII.  THE 2024 GUIDANCE \nThe Guidance is a 189-page document that “addresses how harassment based on race, color, \nreligion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information is defined under EEOC-enforced \nstatutes and the analysis for determining whether employer liability is established.”  App. 19.  It is \ndesigned to “communicate[ ] the Commission’s position on important legal issues,” but is not a \n“survey of all legal principles that might be appropriate in a particular case.”  App. 20, 26.  Instead, it \nfocuses on “the three components of a harassment claim” under EEOC-enforced statutes: (1) whether \nthe harassing conduct was based on an individual’s legally protected characteristic; (2) whether the \nharassment resulted in discrimination with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment; \nand (3) whether there is a basis for holding the employer liable for the conduct.  App. 26. \nThe Guidance is akin to a legal hornbook.  It “presents the overarching legal standards that \nare applied to particular circumstances in evaluating whether the EEO laws have been violated and \nthe employer is liable.”  App. 113.  Its contents “do not have the force and effect of law, are not meant \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 15 of 47     PageID 587\n   \n \nto bind the public in any way, and do not obviate the need for the EEOC and its staff to consider the \nfacts of each case and applicable legal principles when exercising their enforcement discretion.”  App. \n26.  The EEOC was clear that it would not “prejudge the outcome of a specific set of facts presented \nin a charge filed with the EEOC.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs’ challenge here is limited to a portion of one subsection of the Guidance that explains \nthat harassment based on an individual’s gender identity is sex-based harassment.  See Pls.’ Mem. in \nSupp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 1, ECF No. 30 (“Br.”).  That discussion is presented in a section of the \nGuidance that describes “conduct that can, but does not necessarily always, constitute or contribute \nto unlawful harassment.”  App. 27.  “[W]hether specific harassing conduct violates the law,” the \nGuidance explains, “must be assessed on a case-by-case basis” to determine if all elements of a \nharassment claim are satisfied.  Id.  The challenged portion of the Guidance cites the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), to explain that “[s]ex-based discrimination \nunder Title VII includes employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.”  \nApp. 35.  The Guidance goes on to explain that, while Bostock was itself limited to “allegations of \ndiscriminatory discharge,” other “courts have readily found post Bostock that claims of harassment \nbased on one’s sexual orientation or gender identity are cognizable under Title VII.”  App. 128 (citing \ncases).  It then provides examples of “harassing conduct” that courts have found may, in certain \ncircumstances,  contribute  to  unlawful  harassment,  including  among  other  examples  “harassing \nconduct because an individual does not present in a manner that would stereotypically be associated \nwith that person’s sex,” “repeated and intentional . . . misgendering,” and “the denial of access to a \nbathroom or other sex segregated facility consistent with the individual’s gender identity.”  App. 35.  \nEach of those examples is supported by citation to a Title VII case in which the court cited that \nconduct in connection with its larger analysis of a plaintiff’s harassment claim.  See App. 129–30.  \nConsistent with its internal procedures for issuance of significant guidance documents, the \nEEOC adopted the Guidance after notice and comment.  App. 108–09; see 29 C.F.R. § 1695.6; \nProposed Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace, 88 Fed. Reg. 67,750 (Oct. 2, \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 16 of 47     PageID 588\n   \n \n2023).  As did the final Guidance, that notice explained that the “contents of the final guidance \ndocument will not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way.”  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 67,751.  Rather, the EEOC explained its intent that the final document would “provide \nclarity to the public regarding Commission policies and existing requirements under the law.”  Id. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nWhen the record establishes “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,” summary judgment is appropriate.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing \nlaw will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 248 (1986). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Justiciable \nA.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing and Their Claims Are Unripe \nAs  the  Supreme  Court  has  recently  emphasized,  Article  III  standing  is  “a  bedrock \nconstitutional requirement,” “not merely a troublesome hurdle to be overcome if possible so as to \nreach the ‘merits’ of a lawsuit which a party desires to have adjudicated.”  United States v. Texas, 599 \nU.S. 670, 675 (2023) (citation omitted).  “For a plaintiff to get in the federal courthouse door and \nobtain a judicial determination of what the governing law is, the plaintiff . . . must have a ‘personal \nstake’ in the dispute.”  FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 379 (2024) (citation omitted).  \nThis foundational requirement applies even when a plaintiff’s “legal objection is accompanied by a \nstrong moral, ideological, or policy objection.”  Id. at 381.  “[T]he standing requirement [thus] \nimplements ‘the Framers’ concept of the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a \ndemocratic society,’” whereby “courts do not opine on legal issues in response to citizens who might \n‘roam the country in search of governmental wrongdoing.’”  Id. at 379–80 (citations omitted).   \n“Standing requires a plaintiff to satisfy three basic elements: injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability.”  Adams v. City of Harahan, 95 F.4th 908, 912 (5th Cir. 2024) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 17 of 47     PageID 589\n   \n \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)), cert. denied sub nom. Adams v. Harahan, LA, No. 24-102, 2024 WL \n4427225 (U.S. Oct. 7, 2024) (Mem.).  “The burden of establishing standing always rests with \nplaintiffs.”  NAACP v. Tindell, 95 F.4th 212, 216 (5th Cir. 2024).  At the summary judgment stage, \nplaintiffs must provide evidence to support their claim of standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Standing \nis particularly difficult to establish in a pre-enforcement challenge like this one.  There is no \n“unqualified right to pre-enforcement review.”  Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 49 (2021).  \nInstead, many statutory and constitutional rights “are as a practical matter asserted typically as \ndefenses,” not in “pre-enforcement cases.”  Id. at 49–50.   \nApplying these standards here, Plaintiffs fail to establish that they face any injury-in-fact that \nis traceable to the Guidance.  Plaintiffs argue that they have established standing to challenge the \nGuidance for the same reasons this Court held that Texas had standing to challenge the Technical \nAssistance document in Texas v. EEOC.  See Br. at 8.  But that contention overlooks significant, \nmaterial differences between the Technical Assistance document and the Guidance.  In particular, this \nCourt concluded that Texas had Article III standing to challenge the Technical Assistance document \nbecause, the Court determined, the challenged guidance “proscribed” Texas’s “present and intended \nfuture conduct” of maintaining “workplace policies that enforce[d] sex-specific dress codes, sex-\nsegregated bathrooms, and pronoun usage based on biological sex.”  Texas, 2022 WL 22869778, at \n*10, *13.  This Court relied on the Technical Assistance Document’s “mandatory language” to reach \nthat conclusion.  Id. at *5.  The Technical Assistance document stated definitively: “May a covered \nemployer require a transgender employee to dress in accordance with the employee’s sex assigned at \nbirth? No”; “[I]f an employer has separate bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers for men and women, \nall men (including transgender men) should be allowed to use the men’s facilities and all women \n(including transgender women) should be allowed to use the women’s facilities”; and “Could use of \npronouns  or  names  that  are  inconsistent  with  an  individual’s  gender  identity  be  considered \nharassment?  Yes, in certain circumstances.”  Technical Assistance document at 6–7; see Texas, 2022 \nWL 22869778, at *5. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 18 of 47     PageID 590\n   \n \nBy  contrast,  and  as  further  explained  below,  the  2024  Guidance  does  not  purport  to \n“command[], require[], order[], [or] dictate” any particular conduct by employers.  Texas, 2022 WL \n22869778, at *5.  Rather, the Guidance explains at the outset that “harassment (or harassing conduct) \nis only covered by federal [equal employment opportunity] laws if it is based on one (or more) of the \nindividual’s characteristics that are protected by these laws.”  App. 27.  But “[n]ot all harassing conduct \nviolates the law, even if it is because of a legally protected characteristic.” Id.  Rather, “whether specific \nharassing conduct violates the law must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.”  Id.   \nAs noted, the limited portions of the Guidance that Plaintiffs challenge appear in the section \naddressing eight protected characteristics that may give rise to a harassment claim under Title VII: \nrace; color; national origin; religion; sex; age; disability; and genetic information.  See Br. at 5–7.  Within \nthe subsection on sex-based harassment, the Guidance states:  \nHarassing conduct based on sexual orientation or gender identity includes epithets \nregarding  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity; physical  assault  due  to  sexual \norientation or gender identity; outing (disclosure of an individual’s sexual orientation \nor gender identity without permission); harassing conduct because an individual \ndoes not present in a manner that would stereotypically be associated with that \nperson’s sex; repeated and intentional use of a name or pronoun inconsistent \nwith the individual’s known gender identity (misgendering); or the denial of \naccess to a bathroom or other sex segregated facility consistent with the \nindividual’s gender identity.  \nApp. 35 (emphasis added and footnotes omitted).  For each enumerated example, the Guidance cites \none or more cases holding that such conduct could support a finding that the plaintiff was harassed \nbased on a protected characteristic (sex)—though not necessarily that the plaintiff had established a \nprima facie harassment case, much less an entitlement to relief.  The cases cited in the Guidance further \nunderscore that none of the conduct described automatically gives rise to a meritorious harassment \nclaim.  For example, in explaining that repeated misgendering can be a form of sex-based harassment, \nthe Guidance cites Versace v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., No. 6:14-cv-1003-Orl-31KRS, \n2015 WL 12820072, at *7 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2015), and notes that the case “consider[ed] alleged \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 19 of 47     PageID 591\n   \n \nmisgendering to support the plaintiff’s hostile environment claim, but f[ound] the alleged incidents to \nbe insufficiently frequent or severe to constitute a violation.”  App. 130.   \nIn sum, there is no basis for Plaintiffs’ contention that the Guidance interprets any conduct—\nincluding sex-specific bathroom policies, sex-specific dress codes, or misgendering of transgender \nemployees—as a per se Title VII violation.  Because the Guidance does not proscribe any conduct, \nPlaintiffs cannot establish that they face any injury-in-fact traceable to the Guidance.  Cf. Texas, 2022 \nWL 22869778, at *9 (“[A] plaintiff can articulate pre-enforcement standing when it can show ‘an \nintention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed \nby a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.’” (quoting Susan B. Anthony \nList v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014)) (emphasis added)). \nMoreover, Plaintiffs also fail to establish Article III standing for the separate, independent \nreason that they have not shown that they engage in any conduct that conflicts with the legal principles \nsummarized in the Guidance.  In their brief, Plaintiffs assert that “Texas has employment policies that \nare not consistent with the 2024 Guidance’s bathroom, dress code, and pronoun requirements.”  Br. \nat 33 (citing Decl. of Sid Miller, ECF No. 31 (App. 210–12) (“Miller Decl.”)).  But their cited \ndeclaration  belies  that  claim—even  setting  aside  that  the  Guidance  does  not  establish  any \n“requirements” with respect to these issues, as explained above.  Plaintiffs’ declaration states that the \nTexas Department of Agriculture has a policy of “evaluat[ing] on a case-by-case basis” “[w]hether an \nemployee’s manner of dress is unprofessional or inappropriate.”  Miller Decl. ¶ 6.  The Department \n“formalized” its standards in a “Dress Code and Grooming Policy” it adopted on April 13, 2023, id. \n¶ 7, Exh. A, but the case-by-case method of applying this policy, id. ¶ 6, renders it speculative whether \nthe Policy, as applied, conflicts with anything in the Guidance.  Likewise, regarding bathroom use, the \ndeclaration states that “[a]ny complaint regarding restroom usage would be evaluated on a case-by-\ncase basis.”  Id. ¶ 8.  And, similarly, “[a]ny workplace conflicts over pronoun usage would be handled \non a case-by-case basis.”  Id. ¶ 9.   At most, the declarant speculated that he “would consider” an \nemployee’s conduct “to be a violation of [the agency’s dress code] standards” if the employee “dressed \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 20 of 47     PageID 592\n   \n \nas a member of the opposite sex”; “would reject” any request by an employee “to use the restrooms \ndesignated for the opposite sex”; and “would reject” any request by an employee “to require other \nemployees to use pronouns based on gender identity.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 8, 9.  But the declarant cited no State \nlaw or policy that would require those results.  Indeed, to suggest otherwise would be inconsistent \nwith the State’s professed policy of applying case-by-case consideration to such requests.  And, \nnotably, the declarant cites no instance in which the application of its case-by-case standards has \nresulted in disciplinary action against any employee for conduct related to the portions of the Guidance \nchallenged by the Plaintiffs.1 \nThus, even if the Guidance established per se requirements with respect to bathrooms, dress \ncodes, or pronoun use that employers must satisfy to comply with Title VII—which it does not—\nPlaintiffs have not established that Texas’s employment policies conflict with that requirement.  This \ncase accordingly is distinguishable from Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2019), on which \nPlaintiffs attempt to rely.  See Br. at 9–10.  There, the Fifth Circuit found standing to consider a pre-\nenforcement challenge to EEOC guidance with respect to the use of criminal history in hiring.  Texas, \n933 F.3d at 437–38.  The court of appeals held that Texas faced a credible threat of enforcement \nbecause various State agencies “categorically exclude[d] all convicted felons” or “categorically exclude[d] \napplicants convicted of specified felonies” from employment, including as a matter of State law.  Id. \nat 439; see id. at 446–47.  By contrast, as explained above, Texas avers that employment decisions \nrelevant to the issues in this case are left to case-by-case, discretionary consideration.   \n \n1   Defendants recognize that in Texas v. EEOC, this Court credited for purposes of the EEOC’s \nmotion to dismiss Texas’s allegations that it “ha[d] created . . . workplace policies that enforce sex-\nspecific dress codes, sex-segregated bathrooms, and pronoun usage based on biological sex.”   2022 \nWL 22869778, at *13 (emphasis added); see Compl. ¶¶ 30-32, Texas v. EEOC, No. 2:21-cv-00194-Z \n(N.D. Tex. Sept. 20, 2021), ECF No. 1.  However, on a motion for summary judgment, “the plaintiff \ncan no longer rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by affidavit or other evidence ‘specific \nfacts’” establishing Article III standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  Here, \nTexas has merely alleged a conflict between its employment policies and the Guidance—but it has not \nproven that any such conflict exists, as it must to satisfy the summary judgment standard. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 21 of 47     PageID 593\n   \n \nStated differently, standing in Texas v. EEOC was predicated on a clear conflict between what \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded was inflexible agency guidance and inflexible Texas law with respect to \nemployment eligibility.  Here, by contrast, there is no conflict between the Guidance and any legal or \npolicy requirement that Texas has cited with respect to its treatment of transgender employees, both \nof which explicitly require “case-by-case” consideration of all relevant facts.  App. 27; Miller Decl. \n¶¶ 6, 8, 9. \nHeritage likewise fails to establish any conflict between its employment policies and the \nchallenged Guidance.  With respect to attire, Plaintiffs’ declarant avers that “Heritage has a dress code \nthat requires employees to ‘come to work in professional dress, consistent with the mission, culture, \nbusiness functions, and purpose of Heritage,’ and historically employees have dressed in a manner \ntraditionally befitting their biological sex.”  Decl. of Eric Korsvall ¶ 9, ECF No. 31 (App. 217) \n(“Korsvall Decl.”).  But Heritage cites no evidence that a transgender employee would violate the \ndress code by wearing attire traditionally associated with his or her gender identity.  Likewise, Heritage \ncites no evidence of any policy that would prohibit a transgender employee from using a restroom \nconsistent with his or her gender identity or from using pronouns consistent with his or her gender \nidentity.  See generally id.  That may be because Heritage is located in Washington, D.C., where District \nlaw separately prohibits employers from “denying access to restrooms and other gender specific \nfacilities that are consistent with the employee’s gender identity or expression”; prohibits employers \nfrom “requir[ing] individuals to dress or groom themselves in a manner inconsistent with their sex or \ntheir  gender  identity  or  expression”;  and  provides  that  “[d]eliberately  misusing  an  individual’s \npreferred name form of address or gender-related pronoun” “may constitute evidence of unlawful \nharassment and hostile environment,” depending on “the totality of the circumstances.”  D.C. Mun. \nRegs. tit. 4, §§ 801.1(a), 804.1, 808.2(a); see Korsvall Decl. ¶ 10 (“Heritage’s headquarters is in \ndowntown Washington, D.C.”).  Even assuming Heritage’s policies conflict with the Guidance in the \nway they argue, they still could not enforce that policy for the independent reason that it would violate \nDC law.  Any injury to Heritage would not be traceable to the Guidance or redressable through this \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 22 of 47     PageID 594\n   \n \naction because a judgment in their favor would net them nothing.  See McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm’n, \n540 U.S. 93, 229 (2003) (holding that a plaintiff lacked standing when a favorable ruling “would not \nremedy the . . . alleged injury” because the “limitations imposed by” a separate, unchallenged provision \n“would remain unchanged”), overruled on other grounds by Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. \n310 (2010); KH Outdoor, LLC v. Clay Cnty., 482 F.3d 1299, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007). \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiffs also fail to establish that they have incurred or will incur any \nimplementation costs traceable to the Guidance.  Plaintiffs contend that they would need to spend \ntime developing training materials and procedures “to reflect the 2024 Guidance’s policy changes,” \nBr. at 32.  But, as explained, the Guidance does not mandate any policy changes.  Rather, the \nchallenged portions of the Guidance summarize forms of conduct that courts have held can support \na claim that a plaintiff was harassed on the basis of sex.  See App. 35, 130–31.  To the extent Plaintiffs \nthink it necessary or appropriate to update their training materials and procedures in light of those \njudicial decisions (or, in the case of Heritage, the law of the District of Columbia), any associated costs \nflow from the decisions (or laws) themselves, not from the publication of a document correctly \nsummarizing the decisions.  \nRelatedly,  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  Guidance  invades  Texas’s  sovereign  interests  is \nmistaken.  See Br. at 32–33.  Because the Guidance imposes no new legal obligations on any employers \n(public or private), it imposes no new legal obligations on States in their capacity as employers, \nsovereign or otherwise.   \nFinally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because they are unripe.  A “case is \nnot ripe if further factual development is required” or if the “issue presents purely legal questions” \nbut the plaintiff has not shown “hardship.” Choice Inc. of Tex. v. Greenstein, 691 F.3d 710, 715 (5th Cir. \n2012) (citations omitted).  Because the Guidance makes clear that any sex-based harassment claim \nrequires  case-by-case  consideration  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  the  outcome  of  any \nenforcement action that might apply the legal principles set forth in the Guidance would depend on \nfacts not before this Court.  See, e.g., Boh Bros., 731 F.3d at 460 (noting that an inquiry into whether “a \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 23 of 47     PageID 595\n   \n \nreasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would find” an instance or pattern of conduct “severely \nhostile or abusive” for purposes of a Title VII harassment claim “is necessarily fact-specific” (citation \nomitted)).    Again, the challenged Guidance is materially distinct from the Technical Assistance \ndocument.  This Court held that Texas’s challenge to the Technical Assistance document was ripe \nbecause that document “[m]ade Plaintiff’s policies unlawful.”  Texas, 2022 WL 22869778, at *13.  By \ncontrast, as explained above, the Harassment Guidance does not render any particular conduct on the \npart of an employer per se unlawful, much less any conduct in which Plaintiffs prove they have engaged.  \nIn sum, because the record currently before the Court does not permit the “fact-specific analysis” \nnecessary to resolve a Title VII harassment claim, including under the precedents summarized in the \nGuidance, Plaintiffs’ claims are “unripe.”  Walters v. Holder, No. 2:10-CV-76-KS-MTP, 2012 WL \n3644816, at *7 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 23, 2012).   For all of these reasons, the Court lacks jurisdiction over \nPlaintiffs’ claims. \nB.  The 2024 Guidance Is Not Final Agency Action \nThe APA gives federal courts jurisdiction to review final agency action, which is agency action \nthat is (1) “the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and that (2) also determines \n“rights or obligations.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (citations omitted); see also U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 596–600 (2016).  An agency action that “does not of itself \nadversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future \nadministrative action” is not a final agency action for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 704.  Peoples Nat’l \nBank v. Off. of Comptroller of Currency of the U.S., 362 F.3d 333, 337 (5th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  \nAnd “[i]f there is no ‘final agency action,’ a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.” Id. at 336 \n(citation omitted).  Here, the Guidance is not final agency action because it does not impose legal \nconsequences and is, indeed, non-binding on Plaintiffs or anyone else.   \nNothing about the Guidance itself imposes legal consequences on Texas, Heritage, or any \nother party.  Start with the language of the Guidance itself.  The Harassment Guidance imposes no \nrule of law; it merely explains “existing requirements under the law.”  App. 20.  It is not “meant to \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 24 of 47     PageID 596\n   \n \nbind the public in any way” and does not limit staff “enforcement discretion,” which must be applied \n“on a case-by-case basis.”  App. 26.  It specifically states that “[n]othing in this document should be \nunderstood to prejudge the outcome of a specific set of facts presented in a charge filed with the \nEEOC.”  Id.; see Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 388 (6th Cir. 2022) (finding agency guidance that “leaves \nthe exercise of prosecutorial discretion to [agency staff] judgment” was likely unreviewable (citation \nomitted)).   Further, it reiterates that EEOC enforcement staff must make a case-specific assessment \nto determine “whether specific harassing conduct violates the law.”  App. 27.  Nor does the Guidance \npurport to establish comprehensive standards of liability.  Indeed, it does not “survey . . . all legal \nprinciples that might be appropriate in a particular case.”  App. 26.  Likewise, the Guidance does not \ndiscuss all potential defenses that may be raised in response to a harassment claim, and notes that the \nsame should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Id.  \nThe process by which the Guidance was issued is also consistent with the EEOC’s view that \nit is non-binding.  The Guidance was promulgated through procedures designed to “better ensure that \nguidance will be treated as non-binding.”  Procedural Regulations for Issuing Guidance, 85 Fed. Reg. \n69,167, 69,167 (Nov. 2, 2020); see 29 C.F.R. § 1695.2 (requiring EEOC guidance to include prominent \ndisclaimers and avoid using language implying that guidance documents are binding).2  The Federal \nRegister notice seeking public comment on the proposed Guidance similarly made clear to interested \nparties that its contents were not establishing new legal requirements but rather attempting to aid in \npublic clarity about existing requirements imposed by Title VII itself.  88 Fed. Reg. at 67,751.   \nAny legal consequence related to a harassment claim would come from Title VII or other \nstatute itself, not the Guidance.  If the EEOC were to investigate a charge or bring an enforcement \naction against a private employer, or the DOJ were to bring an enforcement action against Texas, they \nwould be doing so for alleged violations of Title VII directly, not any provision of the 2024 \n \n2   The Court’s prior decision involved a Technical Assistance document issued through other \nprocedures.  See Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 843. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 25 of 47     PageID 597\n   \n \nHarassment Guidance.3  The challenged guidance “create[s] no new legal obligations beyond those \nthe [statute] already imposed.”  Rhea Lana, Inc. v. Dept. of Lab., 824 F.3d 1023, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \nAnd it “has force only to the extent the agency can persuade a court to the same conclusion.”  AT&T \nCo. v. EEOC, 270 F.3d 973, 976 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Because the Guidance leaves ample room for EEOC \nstaff to evaluate conduct on a case-by-case basis applying a Title VII analysis, it does not “tell[] EEOC \nstaff and all employers what sort of policy is unlawful” or otherwise necessarily “commit the \nadministrative agency to a specific course of action,” Texas, 933 F.3d at 445 (citation omitted).  It is \ntherefore not reviewable final agency action. \nPlaintiffs’ assertion that the Guidance imposes legal consequences reflects a misunderstanding \nof its scope.  Plaintiffs repeatedly assert that the challenged portions of the Guidance “require[] \nemployers to provide bathroom, dress code, and pronoun accommodations” based on gender identity, \nand that an employer who fails to do so “creates a hostile work environment with harassment that \ndiscriminates based on sex.”  Br. at 1; see also id. at 5 (contending that the Guidance “reimposed similar \ndress code, bathroom, and pronoun accommodation policies as the 2021 Guidance”); id. at 7 \n(contending that the Guidance requires employers to create exceptions to “sex-specific dress code[s] \n. . . to avoid liability”); id. at 14 (asserting that the Guidance “states that an employer unlawfully \n‘discriminates’ on the basis of sex if it adheres to sex-specific bathroom, dress, or pronoun policies”).  \nThat is not what the Guidance says.  As discussed above, the Guidance nowhere declares that any \nactions by an employer automatically are unlawful, nor does it state that such actions, without more, \n \n3   While the EEOC investigates charges against State respondents, Title VII provides that the \nEEOC cannot file suit against a State but must refer such charges to the DOJ to determine whether \nto bring a civil action.  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1).  Under the Government Employee Rights Act of \n1991 (“GERA”), the EEOC also has jurisdiction to administratively adjudicate, subject to judicial \nreview,  claims  brought  by  individuals  involving  certain  State  elected  officials’  personal  staff, \npolicymaking staff, and immediate advisors.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16c(a).  In GERA cases, the matter is \nbrought by the individual, and the EEOC (through an Administrative Law Judge with review by the \nCommission) adjudicates the claim.  See generally 29 C.F.R. §§ 1603.100–1603.306   \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 26 of 47     PageID 598\n   \n \nautomatically create Title VII liability for sex harassment.4  Rather, the Guidance addresses potential \nemployer liability for claims of harassment.   \nCorrectly interpreted, the portions of the Guidance Plaintiffs challenge merely reflect that \ncertain types of conduct directed at employees because of their gender identity may, depending on the \ncircumstances, constitute evidence in support of a hostile work environment claim.  Indeed, the \nportion of the Guidance that addresses gender identity—Section II.A.5.c—falls within the portion of \nthe  Guidance  identifying  “the  legally  protected  characteristics  covered  by  the  federal  [equal \nemployment opportunity] laws enforced by the EEOC.”  App. 27.  That portion of the Guidance \nexplains that such conduct “can, but does not necessarily always, constitute or contribute to unlawful \nharassment, including a hostile work environment.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The Guidance further \nexplains that not “all harassing conduct violates the law, even if it is because of a legally protected \ncharacteristic.”  Id.  The statements in Section II, therefore, do not bind anyone to the view that the \nspecific examples therein establish liability under Title VII because “whether specific harassing \nconduct violates the law must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.”  The specific examples do not \nestablish liability unless a charge establishes that the workplace harassment was so severe or pervasive \nthat it affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment and there is a basis for holding the \nemployer liable.  Id. (“Section II does not address whether such conduct reaches the point of creating \na hostile work environment.”).  Because Section II only addresses when potentially harassing conduct \nis based on a protected basis—and does not address these other required elements—it cannot establish \nthe per se rule of liability for failure to provide pronoun, dress code, or bathroom accommodations \nthat Plaintiffs claim it does.   \n \n4   In fact, in its only express statement on that issue, the Guidance simply states that “denial of \naccess to a bathroom consistent with one’s gender identity may be a discriminatory action in its own \nright and should be evaluated accordingly.”  App. 131.  A statement that a certain policy may be \ndiscriminatory is not conclusive as to the EEOC’s view as to whether it is violative of Title VII in all \ncircumstances.  On the contrary, the fact that the EEOC felt the need to raise such a possibility itself \ndemonstrates that the remainder of the Guidance does not say that such policies necessarily violate \nTitle VII, as Plaintiffs contend.      \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 27 of 47     PageID 599\n   \n \nIn arguing to the contrary, Plaintiffs assert that the Guidance “gives mandatory commands” \nand “provides definitive examples of factual scenarios that would create liability for harassing conduct \nbased on gender identity.”  Br. at 11–12 (citing App. 35–36 and Examples 14 & 15).  Those examples, \nhowever, are merely explanations of when “[h]arassing conduct” is “based on” an employee’s gender \nidentity.  App. 35.  The Guidance “does not address whether” the conduct set forth in those examples \n“reaches the point of creating a hostile work environment” and is therefore unlawful.  App. 27.5  \nNotably, Plaintiffs do not contend that the remainder of the Guidance or the dozens of examples \naddressing,  for  example,  race-based  harassment  or  employer  liability  determine  any  rights  or \nobligations. \nTexas cites Example 46 to argue that the Guidance requires employers to provide bathroom, \npronoun, and dress code “accommodations.”  Br. at 6.  But that example does not express—much \nless bind the EEOC to—any view that an employer’s failure to permit employees to use bathrooms, \ndress, and adopt pronouns in accordance with their gender identities is always unlawful harassment \nunder Title VII.  Example 46 is situated within a discussion of “some significant aspects of context \nthat can be relevant in determining whether harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create \na hostile work environment,” and the Guidance makes clear that “[o]ther considerations also may be \n \n5   Example 14 addresses harassment based on sexual orientation and therefore the substance of \nthat example appears to be outside the scope of Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Guidance, which is focused \non their perception that the Guidance “requires employers to provide bathroom, dress code, and \npronoun accommodations” based on gender identity.  Br. at 1.  As the 2024 Harassment Guidance \nexplains, Example 15 was “adapted from the facts in Cunningham v. Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse \nCorp., No. 1:18-cv-11266, 2024 WL 863236 (D.N.J. Feb. 29, 2024).”  App. 131.  The district court in \nCunningham denied a private employer’s motion for summary judgment on a Title VII hostile work \nenvironment claim based on testimony that the plaintiff had been “misgendered between thirty and \nforty percent of the time,” had been “asked by a coworker if she was born a man” and “was instructed \n. . . to wear pants as opposed to skirts, while other employees were permitted to wear dresses and \nskirts.”  2024 WL 863236, at *6.  Example 15 does not include facts regarding the use of bathrooms. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 28 of 47     PageID 600\n   \n \nrelevant in evaluating harassment in light of the totality of the circumstances.”  App. 61.  In other \nwords, further fact-specific analysis on a case-by-case basis is required.6    \nFor all these reasons, the Guidance under review here differs markedly from the Technical \nAssistance document this Court concluded was final agency action in a prior case.  See Texas, 2022 WL \n22869778, at *2–6.  There, the Court concluded that the document used “mandatory language” \nconcluding that specific employer practices related to dress codes and bathroom usage were not \npermitted.  Id. at *5.7  For the reasons explained, the Guidance at issue here does not do that. \nNor does the Guidance bind EEOC staff to any legal position.  See Texas, 933 F.3d at 443.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the Guidance is intended to be used “as a resource” for employers, employees, \nEEOC staff, and courts considering “harassment claims.”  App. 26; see Br. at 11.  But the fact that \nagency staff may refer to the Guidance in exercising their duty to make a case-specific assessment does \nnot make it a binding source of legal consequences.  If anything, it only confirms that the Guidance is \njust what it purports to be: a general resource to aid staff that does not “obviate the need for the \nEEOC and its staff to consider the facts of each case and applicable legal principles when exercising \n \n6   Example 46 was “adapted from the facts in Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, LLC, 472 F. Supp. 3d \n115 (E.D. Pa. 2020).”  App. 163.  That court denied a motion to dismiss a Title VII hostile work \nenvironment claim where the plaintiff alleged that she had been “misgendered” and “prevented from \nusing the women’s bathroom, had her duties changed so as to be kept out of the view of customers, \nwas asked probing questions about her anatomy and gender identity, was subject to a stricter dress \ncode than other female and cisgender employees, and was ultimately terminated.”  Doe, 472 F. Supp. \n3d at 129; see also Copeland v. Ga. Dep’t of Corr., 97 F.4th 766, 779 (11th Cir. 2024) (holding that a \nreasonable jury could conclude that calling the plaintiff, a transgender man, “ma’am,” “it,” and “that” \nand intentionally and repeatedly using incorrect pronouns over a facility-wide radio system, along with \nother harassment, constituted unlawful harassment based on sex).  Example 46 does not include facts \nwith regard to dress codes or bathroom use. \n7   This Court’s earlier decision also cited as an example of “mandatory language” a statement \nthat the use of pronouns or names that are inconsistent with an individual’s gender identity could in \nsome circumstances constitute harassment.  Texas, 2022 WL 22869778, at *5.  The Guidance here uses \ndifferent language and includes a fuller explanation of the required elements that must be shown \nbefore an employer may be held liable for a hostile work environment.  The inclusion of those \nadditional elements in the Guidance makes it even clearer that misgendering alone is not always a Title \nVII violation, as Plaintiffs here suggest.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 29 of 47     PageID 601\n   \n \ntheir enforcement discretion.”  App. 26; see Texas, 933 F.3d at 442 (citing Syncor Int’l Corp. v. Shalala, \n127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). \nThe Guidance here thus differs from the EEOC action at issue in the Fifth Circuit’s decision \nin Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 443–46.  The EEOC in that case did “not dispute that the Guidance” \nwas binding on “EEOC staff,” id. at 443, which is not the case here, see App. 26.  The document at \nissue  there,  moreover,  told  “EEOC  staff”  that  specific  employment  practices  were  inherently \n“unlawful,” forbade “staff from considering certain evidence . . . when deciding whether an employer \nhas satisfied Title VII’s requirements,” and “direct[ed] their decisions about which employers to refer \nfor enforcement actions.”  Texas, 933 F.3d at 443.  The challenged portions of the Harassment \nGuidance at issue here, in contrast, do not “broadly condemn[]” any specific employment practice \nwithout further analysis.  Id.  Those challenged portions merely explain that some types of conduct \nmay in appropriate circumstances be considered as part of the analysis in determining whether \nharassment is based on sex.  Because those portions of the Guidance do not mandate any finding with \nrespect to any particular conduct or in any specific case, the Guidance leaves ample “room for EEOC \nstaff not to issue referrals to the Attorney General” or not to find reasonable cause following the \ninvestigation of a charge.  Id.  For example, in any particular case, the investigator might conclude that \nthe challenged conduct might not be sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work \nenvironment, or that the employee did not find the conduct subjectively offensive, or there is not a \nsufficient basis for holding the employer liable.  Further, even if all those elements were met, a \nreasonable cause determination was issued, and conciliation failed, EEOC staff or DOJ would still \nhave further discretion to issue a right-to-sue notice to the aggrieved individual or file a civil action.       \nFor the same reason, Plaintiffs are also wrong to argue that the Guidance creates “norms or \nsafe harbors” by which employers can avoid enforcement or referral.  Br. at 12.  The Guidance does \nnot say that EEOC staff must pursue enforcement of employers who lack any particular policies \nrelated to bathrooms, dress codes, or pronouns, nor does it say that employers could avoid liability \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 30 of 47     PageID 602\n   \n \nfor an otherwise hostile work environment merely because it had such a policy.8  Simply put, the \nGuidance does not require EEOC staff to pursue an employer because it maintains “sex-specific \nbathroom and dress policies” or policies related to pronoun usage, id. at 9, and Plaintiffs point to no \nlanguage of the Guidance that requires employers to adopt such policies.   \nPlaintiffs’ reference to the Supreme Court’s decision in Hawkes is similarly inapt.  Br. at 13–\n14.  In that case, determinations by the Army Corps of Engineers triggered a regulation generally \nbinding the Corps to those determinations for five years.  Hawkes, 578 U.S. at 593.  They also bound \nthe  Federal  Government  “in  any  subsequent  Federal  action  or  litigation  concerning  that  final \ndetermination.”  Id. at 598.  The Guidance, in contrast, takes no position on any specific employer’s \npractices, and no separate regulation binds the EEOC to any view expressed in the Guidance in \nsubsequent  enforcement  actions.    For  example,  a decision  by  an  EEOC  investigator  that  the \nharassment alleged in a specific charge was not severe or pervasive would not create immunity for the \nsame employer in a different charge because harassment cases are, by their nature, fact specific, and \neven if the EEOC found no reasonable cause, an individual plaintiff could still bring a lawsuit.  Nor \ndoes the Guidance preclude EEOC staff from exercising discretion not to pursue enforcement even \nwhen a charge credibly asserts that an employee was subject to extensive and intentional misgendering \nor was prohibited from complying with a dress code or using a bathroom consistent with that \nemployee’s gender identity.  Moreover, any later enforcement action would be based on Title VII, not \nthe Guidance.  And, for the same reasons, the Guidance does not bind DOJ.  Indeed, Plaintiffs do \nnot even contend that DOJ is bound by the Guidance.  Br. at 13 (arguing only that DOJ has “never \ndisavowed an intention to pursue enforcement of EEOC referrals pursuant to the 2024 Guidance”).  \nNone  of  Plaintiffs’  remaining  characterizations  of  the  Guidance  establish  that  legal \nconsequences flow from it.  See Br. at 4.  That an “employer may be liable for a hostile workplace \n \n8   While the Guidance explains that an effective anti-harassment policy can factor into whether \nan affirmative defense applies, it also states that “even the best anti-harassment policy . . . will not \nnecessarily establish that the employer has exercised reasonable care to prevent harassment.”  App. \n85. \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 31 of 47     PageID 603\n   \n \ncreated by its customers” is not a novel construction adopted by the Guidance, but a long-standing \nprinciple of Title VII.  Siddiqui v. AutoZone W., Inc., 731 F. Supp. 2d 639, 647 n.11 (N.D. Tex. 2010); \nsee  also  Gardner  v.  CLC  of  Pascagoula,  LLC,  915  F.3d  320,  322  (5th  Cir.  2019)  (observing  that \n“nonemployees can be the source of the harassment” in a hostile work environment claim if the \nplaintiff can “show that the employer knew or should have known about the hostile work environment \nyet allowed it to persist”); App. 78 & nn.246–50 (collecting cases in which courts have held that \nemployers may be liable for acts of harassment committed against employees by non-employees).  And \nwhile the Guidance cites caselaw establishing an affirmative defense to a hostile work environment \nclaim based on an employer’s exercise of reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment, it notes \nthat “Federal EEO law does not specify particular steps an employer must take to establish that it \nexercised reasonable care.”  App. 84; see Hockman v. Westward Commc’ns, 407 F.3d 317, 329 (5th Cir. \n2004) (stating that “[w]hat constitutes prompt remedial action depends on the facts of the case”).  \nBecause Texas has not established that the 2024 Harassment Guidance has any “actual legal effect,” \nthis Court lacks jurisdiction to review it under the APA.  Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, \n252 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nII.  The 2024 Guidance Does Not Violate the APA \nA.  The 2024 Guidance Is Not Contrary to Law \nTitle VII makes it unlawful for an employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any \nindividual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a)(1).  In Bostock, the Supreme Court construed this provision to prohibit discrimination against \nemployees for being gay or transgender, because for an employer to discriminate against an employee \non those bases “the employer must intentionally discriminate against individual men and women in \npart because of sex.”  590 U.S. at 662; see also id. at 660 (explaining that an “employee’s sex plays an \nunmistakable and impermissible role” when an employer “intentionally penalizes a person identified \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 32 of 47     PageID 604\n   \n \nas male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth.” \n(emphasis added)) \n“[A] plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that discrimination based on \nsex has created a hostile or abusive work environment.”  Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, \n66 (1986).  In the four years since the Bostock decision, various courts have recognized that a plaintiff \nmay state a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII by alleging sufficiently severe or pervasive \nharassment based on the plaintiff’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  See, e.g., Doe v. City of Detroit, \n3 F.4th 294, 300 n.1 (6th Cir. 2021) (“Harassment on the basis of transgender identity is sex \ndiscrimination under Title VII because ‘it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being . . . \ntransgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.’” (quoting Bostock, 590 U.S. \nat 660)); Goings v. Lopinto, No. 22-2549, 2023 WL 2709826, at *5 (E.D. La. Mar. 30, 2023) (holding \nthat plaintiff adequately pleaded that the basis of the harassment by the defendant was his perceived \nsexual orientation); cf. Newbury v. City of Windcrest, 991 F.3d 672, 677 (5th Cir. 2021) (observing that \nBostock’s clarification that Title VII prohibits sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination did \nnot “alter[] the preexisting legal standard for sexual harassment.”).  Several courts, including one in \nthis district, have also concluded that allegations of repeated and intentional misgendering,  and \nrequirements to comply with sex-specific dress codes or use sex-separated bathroom facilities that do \nnot align with the plaintiff’s gender identity may support a hostile work environment claim assuming \nthe other required elements are met.  See, e.g., Copeland, 97 F.4th at 771–72, 779 (citing misgendering \nallegations); T.D.H. v. Kazi Foods of N.J., Inc., Civ. No. 5:23-cv-00634-JMG, 2023 WL 4567722, at *9–\n10 (E.D. Pa. July 17, 2023) (citing questions about “preferred pronouns in front of customers and \nemployees despite having allegedly already known them” as supporting hostile work environment \nclaim); Eller v. Prince George’s Cnty. Pub. Schs., 580 F. Supp. 3d 154, 172–73 (D. Md. 2022); Doe, 472 F. \nSupp. 3d at 129–30 (citing fact that plaintiff was misgendered, “prevented from using the women’s \nbathroom,” and “was subject to a stricter dress code” among other factors to conclude plaintiff had \nsufficiently pleaded a hostile work environment claim); Parker v. Strawser Constr., Inc., 307 F. Supp. 3d \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 33 of 47     PageID 605\n   \n \n744, 748 (S.D. Ohio 2018); cf. Roberts v. Glenn Indus. Grp., Inc., 998 F.3d 111, 121 (4th Cir. 2021) (“[T]he \nSupreme Court’s holding in Bostock makes clear that a plaintiff may prove that same-sex harassment is \nbased on sex where the plaintiff was perceived as not conforming to traditional male stereotypes.”); \nSmith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 571–75 (6th Cir. 2004) (“Sex stereotyping based on a person’s \ngender non-conforming behavior is impermissible discrimination, irrespective of the cause of that \nbehavior”); Garrett v. Kohls Distrib. eFulfillment Ctr., No. 3:23-cv-2525, 2024 WL 3237184, at *4, *6 (N.D. \nTex. June 7, 2024) (concluding that allegations that an employees’ coworkers “fail[ed] to use correct \npronouns,” that the employee felt uncomfortable “in either bathroom,” and that the employee was \nsubjected to derogatory comments were sufficient to state a prima facie claim that adverse employment \naction was based on sex discrimination), report and recommendation adopted, 2024 WL 3240656 (N.D. Tex. \nJune 28, 2024). \nThe challenged portions of the Guidance correctly reflect the holdings of these cases.  \nPlaintiffs may disagree with those courts’ conclusions, but they concede (as they must) that cases cited \nin the Guidance identified factors that could support a finding of harassment.  See Br. at 25–26.  \nPlaintiffs, however, ignore that the Guidance reflects the legal principles laid out in those cases, \nprinciples that are consistent with the well-settled legal standard that dictates when harassment based \non sex can create liability under Title VII.  That same standard has been upheld by the Supreme Court \nand applied in this Circuit.  See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998); Boh Bros., \n731 F.3d at 453.    \nThe Guidance does not purport to require specific employment practices; rather it expressly \nacknowledges that “whether specific harassing conduct violates the law must be assessed on a case-\nby-case basis” in accordance with these well-settled legal standards.  App. 27.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ \nclaim,  neither  the  Guidance  nor  the  cases  it  relies  on  state  that  Title  VII  requires  specific \n“accommodations” based on sex related to dress codes, pronouns, or bathrooms.  Br. at 17–22.  \nRather, the challenged portion of the Guidance merely conveys, with citation to appropriate cases, \nthat courts may consider conduct such as repeated and intentional misgendering, forcing an employee \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 34 of 47     PageID 606\n   \n \nto  dress  inconsistently  from  their  gender  identity,  and  requiring  employees  use  sex-separated \nbathroom facilities that do not align with their gender identity are among the constellation of factors \nthat may support a finding that harassment was so severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of \nemployment.   \nPlaintiffs’ contrary interpretation of the Guidance again reflects a misreading of what it says.  \nPlaintiffs contend that the Guidance “claims that ‘the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the [Bostock] \ndecision . . . logically extends’ to other employment activities, like bathroom and pronoun policies.”  \nBr. at 15 (quoting App. 128).  The cited language, however, does not suggest Bostock extends to specific \nemployment activities that were not at issue in that case.  In fact, the cited portion of the Guidance \nsays that Bostock’s reasoning about discriminatory discharge “logically extends to claims of harassment \nthat change the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”  App. 128 (emphasis added).   \nPlaintiffs’ citation of several cases concluding that certain sex-specific policies do not “rise to the level \nof discrimination,” Br. at 15 (citation omitted), are consistent with the Guidance, which requires a fact \nspecific analysis for each case, rather than deciding that certain conduct would always or never be \nharassment.  Plaintiffs similarly assert that the “Guidance did not address discrimination based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity as aspects of sex discrimination, as did Bostock.”  Br. at 19.  But \nthat is also incorrect.  The portion of the Guidance discussing sexual orientation and gender identity \nis a subsection of the Guidance discussing sex discrimination.  App. 32, 35.  As the Guidance notes, \n“Sex-based discrimination under Title VII includes employment discrimination based on sexual \norientation or gender identity.”  App. 35.  \nThese misinterpretations of the Guidance lead Plaintiffs to incorrectly assert that the Guidance \nrequires  specific  accommodations  for  certain  employees.    The  Guidance  does  not  require \naccommodations based on sex, including gender identity, any more than Title VII’s prohibition of \nharassment requires accommodations in connection with any other protected characteristic, including \nsex.  No one would argue that under a hostile-work environment theory a man is provided an \n“accommodation” because his co-workers abstain from calling him insufficiently masculine, yet those \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 35 of 47     PageID 607\n   \n \ntypes of verbal attacks may be considered in assessing whether a male employee has established \nsufficiently severe or pervasive harassment.  See Oncale, 523 U.S. at 77.  A transgender employee \nsimilarly receives no “accommodation” when they are not subjected to harassment because they are \ntransgender.   \nIndeed, Plaintiffs cannot dispute that sexual harassment claims may include harassment based \non failure to adhere to sex stereotypes.  See e.g., Boh Bros., 731 F.3d at 449, 453, 457, 461 (explaining \nthat plaintiff presented evidence that male employee suffered “sufficiently severe or pervasive” sex-\nbased harassment where he was repeatedly called “princess” by a supervisor who perceived him as \n“not a manly-enough man”); Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 256 F.3d 864, 873–74 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(finding “sufficiently severe” harassment where a supervisor and coworkers called a male employee \n“she,” “her,” and a “female whore” because he “did not conform to their gender-based stereotypes”).  \nThey point to no principled reason for why transgender people should be treated any differently.  \nUnder Plaintiffs’ reasoning, if a hospital had a policy of referring to all male nurses with the title “Ms.” \nbecause they work in a “woman’s job,” Title VII could not prohibit that policy because the choice of \nwhat title to use is “volitional.”  Br. at 18.  Even if there was a “perfect correlation” between the use \nof the title “Ms.” and the female gender, under Plaintiffs’ reasoning, that still would not be enough \nfor this misgendering of male nurses to violate Title VII.  Br. at 18–19.  The male nurse in such a work \nenvironment would not be requesting an “accommodation,” id. at 19, if he complained about being \nmisgendered and neither are transgender people who complain about misgendering—they are just \nasking their employer to remedy harassment. \nThe Guidance is consistent with this Court’s decision that the EEOC’s prior Technical \nAssistance document was contrary to law for the same reason.  In determining that Bostock’s holding \nwas limited to discrimination based on status, the Court acknowledged that a Title VII complainant \ncould  rely  on  harassment  directed  at  associated  conduct  to  make  out  a  claim  of  status-based \ndiscrimination.  Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 835–36.  As this Court noted, “the Fifth Circuit held evidence \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 36 of 47     PageID 608\n   \n \nof harassment arising out of a plaintiff’s failure to conform to sex-stereotypes ‘can certainly be evidence \nthat gender played a part.’”  Id. (quoting Boh Bros., 731 F.3d at 454). \nPlaintiffs also wrongly assert that discrimination based on gender identity should not be \nencompassed by Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination based on sex because some “transgender \npersons” may “make no attempt to socially transition,” Br. at 18.  This argument misses the point and \nis directly contrary to Bostock.  As the Supreme Court explained, regardless of any social transition, \n“sex is necessarily a but-for cause” of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity \n“because  it  is  impossible  to  discriminate  against  a  person  for  being  . . . transgender  without \ndiscriminating  against  that  individual  based  on  sex.”    Bostock,  590  U.S.  at  660-61;  id.  at  669 \n(“[D]iscrimination based on . . . transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex.”).   \nPlaintiffs’ analysis of the cases referenced in the Guidance underscores that the agency’s \ninterpretation of Title VII is well founded.  For example, Plaintiffs note that in Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, \nLLC, 472 F. Supp. 3d 115 (E.D. Pa. 2020), the court held that “the plaintiff’s alleged pattern of \nharassment stated a claim for a hostile work environment under Title VII” where “misgendering and \nbathroom use were among the many allegations of harassment.”  Br. at 25 (citation omitted).  Similarly, \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the Court in Tudor v. Southeastern Oklahoma State University, No. 15-cv-324, \n2017 WL 4849118 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 26, 2017), aff’d, 13 F.4th 1019 (10th Cir. 2021), cited “restrictions \non bathroom use and extensive misgendering among multiple factors by which it determined a jury \ncould find harassment.”  Br. at 26 (citation omitted).   That the jury determined that the plaintiff failed \nto prove his allegations in that specific case, id., does not undermine the court’s conclusion that the \nclaim was legally sufficient.  Plaintiffs’ acknowledgement that these courts concluded that the specific \nactions at issue in this case can in appropriate contexts contribute to a hostile work environment aligns \nwith the challenged portion of the Guidance.  App. 128.  And those cases are inconsistent with \nPlaintiffs’ position that such actions can never contribute to a hostile work environment claim.  In any \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 37 of 47     PageID 609\n   \n \nevent, Plaintiffs simply ignore the many additional Title VII cases cited in the Guidance and that have \nbeen decided since its publication.  See App. 128, 130.9  \nIn contrast with the cases cited by the EEOC, none of Plaintiffs’ cases support their argument \nthat the EEOC may never consider repeated and intentional misgendering, requirements to comply \nwith sex-specific dress codes, and requirements to use sex-separated bathrooms inconsistent with an \nemployee’s gender identity, in analyzing a harassment claim.  See Br. at 14–26.  Plaintiffs’ request for \nsuch a per se rule is flatly inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s instruction that “the objective severity \nof harassment should be judged . . . considering ‘all the circumstances.’”  Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81 (quoting \nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).  That “inquiry requires careful consideration of the \nsocial context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target.”  Id.  Harassing \nconduct that is severe or pervasive in one context might not be so in another.  Id. (“A professional \nfootball player’s working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, if the coach \nsmacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field—even if the same behavior would reasonably \nbe experienced as abusive by the coach’s secretary (male or female) back at the office.”); cf. Ash v. Tyson \nFoods, Inc., 546 U.S. 454, 456 (2006) (per curiam) (explaining “context, inflection, tone of voice, local \ncustom,  and  historical  usage”  are  relevant  in  assessing  evidence  of  discriminatory \nintent).   Determining the “real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation \nof surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships” that cannot be reduced to the bright-\nline rule Plaintiffs seek.  Oncale, 523 U.S. at 82.   \nAs these cases establish, Plaintiffs’ argument that specific conduct “cannot constitute harassing \nbehavior” when it is not “inherently discriminatory” is simply incorrect.  Br. at 25.  Whether that \n \n9   Plaintiffs also cite a recent EEOC civil enforcement complaint filed in federal district court as \nan example of overreach.  Br. at 9.  The EEOC alleged in that complaint that an employer subjected \na class of transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment including repeatedly subjecting the \ntransgender employees to misgendering, graphic sexual comments, unequal access to bathrooms, \nintrusive questions from supervisors about their genitalia and sexual activity, and other degrading \nconduct based on gender identity.  See generally Compl., EEOC v. Starboard Grp., Inc., No. 3:24-cv-2260 \n(S.D. Ill. Oct. 1, 2024).  Nothing in the complaint cites or relies on the Guidance challenged here.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 38 of 47     PageID 610\n   \n \nconduct is harassing will depend on the circumstances presented.  Oncale, 523 U.S. at 82–83; Harris, \n510 U.S. at 23; App. 27 (noting that the term “harassing conduct” as used in the Guidance refers to \n“conduct that can, but does not necessarily always, constitute or contribute to unlawful harassment”). \nPlaintiffs also criticize the EEOC for citing its federal section administrative appeal opinions \naddressing the provision of Title VII that applies to federal employees.  See Br. at 25.  This Court has \nalready concluded that it was not arbitrary and capricious for the EEOC to rely on those opinions and \nthat they may be cited as persuasive authority in court.  Texas, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 838, 836.  Defendants \nacknowledge that this Court concluded that the federal sector authorities cited in the Guidance in \ninterpreting Title VII’s provision that applies to State and private employers were unpersuasive in \nconnection with the Technical Assistance document.  Id.  (noting that “the Court cannot assume these \nprovisions  should  be  interpreted  synonymously”).    Defendants  respectfully  disagree  with  that \nconclusion, as the substantive provisions of Title VII do not vary when the complainant is a federal \nemployee.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k) (defining the terms “because of sex” and “on the basis of sex” \nidentically); Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U.S. 840, 841 (1976) (stating that Congress intended to extend \nto “[a]ggrieved [federal] employees or applicants . . . the full rights available in the courts as are granted \nto individuals in the private sector under title VII” (citation omitted)); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, \n547 (1974) (“[i]n general, it may be said that the substantive anti-discrimination law embraced in Title \nVII was carried over and applied to the Federal Government”).  Even were the Court to adhere to its \nprior analysis, however, the EEOC cited many additional State- and private-employer cases to support \nits analysis.  See App. 128, 130.  Plaintiffs offer no support for their requested order declaring that \nEEOC decisions “are not applicable” to State or private employers or for an injunction prohibiting \nthe EEOC from relying on them even as persuasive authority.  See Proposed Order at 2–3, ECF No. \n30-1. \nBecause the Guidance is not contrary to law, the Court should grant Defendants’ summary \njudgment on Count 1 of Plaintiffs’ Complaint. \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 39 of 47     PageID 611\n   \n \nB.  The EEOC Had Authority to Issue the Guidance \nPlaintiffs contend that the Guidance exceeds the EEOC’s limited rulemaking power under \nTitle VII because it is a substantive rule.  See Compl. ¶¶ 171–79 (Count 2).  It is not.  At most, the \nGuidance is an interpretive rule within the EEOC’s authority because it lacks “the force and effect of \nlaw.”  See Cal. Cmtys. Against Toxics v. EPA, 934 F.3d 627, 634–35 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (noting that the \n“finality analysis is distinct from the test for whether a rule is legislative”). \n“Legislative” or “substantive” rules are defined as agency actions which have the “force and \neffect of law.”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 \nU.S. 281, 302–03 (1979)).  Such rules are distinct from “interpretative rules, general statements of \npolicy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice,” which are exempt from notice and \ncomment procedures.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  “[T]he critical feature of interpretive rules is that they \nare ‘issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s construction of the statutes and rules \nwhich it administers.’”  Perez, 575 U.S. at 97 (citation omitted); see also Shell Offshore Inc. v. Babbitt, 238 \nF.3d 622, 628 (5th Cir. 2001) (“[I]nterpretive rules are statements as to what the administrative officer \nthinks the statute or regulation means.” (quoting Brown Express Inc. v. United States, 607 F.2d 695, 700 \n(5th Cir. 1979)).   \nThe Fifth Circuit has stated that, to distinguish “substantive rules from nonsubstantive rules,” \nthe primary issue is whether the rule constitutes a “binding norm,” by creating a “binding effect on \nagency discretion or severely restrict[ing] it.”  See Pros. & Patients for Customized Care v. Shalala, 56 F.3d \n592, 595 (5th Cir. 1995).  In examining whether a rule is sufficiently binding to qualify as legislative, \n“the starting point is ‘the agency’s characterization of the rule,” which is afforded “deference.”  Id. at \n596 (quoting Metro. Sch. Dist. of Wayne Twp., Marion Cnty. v. Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 489 (7th Cir. 1992)).  \nThen, in examining the text of the rule at issue, “[t]he key inquiry . . . is the extent to which the \nchallenged policy leaves the agency free to exercise its discretion to follow or not follow that general \npolicy in an individual case.”  Id. (quoting Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 716 F.2d 1369, 1377 \n(11th Cir. 1983)).  “As long as the agency remains free to consider the individual facts in the various \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 40 of 47     PageID 612\n   \n \ncases that arise, then the agency action in question has not established a binding norm.”  Id. at 596–\n97 (quoting Ryder Truck Lines, 716 F.2d at 1377). \nUnder this test, the Guidance does not qualify as a substantive rule.  The Guidance does not \nitself impose any rights or obligations, but rather explains the EEOC’s “position on important legal \nissues” arising under Title VII.  App. 20.  To the extent the challenged statements in the Guidance \nPlaintiffs challenge are consistent with employees’ rights or employers’ obligations under anti-\ndiscrimination laws within the EEOC’s jurisdiction, those rights and obligations are created by the \nunderlying statutes, not the Guidance itself.  And for the reasons already explained, the Guidance \nexpressly requires EEOC staff to consider whether the specific facts of a charge meet the standards \nfor liability imposed by Title VII and relevant precedent, regardless of the Guidance.  The Guidance \nis, therefore, non-binding. \nEven if the Court were to conclude that the Guidance is binding in some sense on the agency \nitself, the Guidance would still qualify as a permissible interpretive rule within the EEOC’s authority.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the Guidance must be a substantive rule because it “binds agency staff and the \npublic because of its mandatory language,” Br. at 29 (citation omitted), but this “argument misapplies \nthe proper legal standard,” Flight Training Int’l, Inc. v. FAA, 58 F.4th 234, 242 (5th Cir. 2023).  The \nFifth Circuit has “reject[ed] the proposition that a rule cannot be interpretive if it limits discretion or \nuses binding language.”  Id.  Indeed, mandatory language may be appropriate in an interpretive rule \nthat “explain[s] what an agency thinks a statute or regulation actually says.”  Id.  “If the law is \nmandatory, then it is natural for an agency’s restatement of the law to speak in mandatory terms as \nwell.”  Id. \nThat is exactly the case here.  The Guidance informs the public “of existing requirements \nunder the law.”  App. 20.  As explained above, the Guidance does not itself mandate anything.  The \nGuidance “presents a legal analysis of standards for harassment and employer liability applicable to \nclaims  of  harassment  under  the  equal  employment  opportunity  . . .  statutes  enforced  by  the \nCommission.”  App. 25.  And it cites relevant precedent for each legal assertion Plaintiffs here \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 41 of 47     PageID 613\n   \n \nchallenge.  That language does not suggest that the Commission was promulgating a document with \nindependent legal force such that it becomes a substantive, legislative rule.  Such rules are created \n“only when the agency seeks to make substantive law” pursuant to “the agency’s congressionally-\ndelegated powers” to do so, which the Commission here does not claim.  Flight Training Int’l, 58 F.4th \nat 241 n.5 (explaining that legislative “rules bind courts, not because they are entitled to deference, but \nbecause they actually are law”). \nThe Guidance, moreover, fits squarely within the EEOC’s long history of issuing guidance \nexplaining its views on Title VII and the other statutes within its jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Meritor Sav. \nBank, 477 U.S. at 64–65 (citing “EEOC issued Guidelines” on Title VII issue Supreme Court had yet \nto opine); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 430–31 (1975) cf. Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 471 \n(2023) (discussing EEOC guidance with approval); EEOC Guidance, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-\nguidance (including numerous documents informing the public regarding EEOC’s processes and \nestablished rights and responsibilities under the laws it enforces).  To be sure, “Congress, in enacting \nTitle VII, did not confer upon the EEOC authority to promulgate rules or regulations pursuant to \nthat Title.”  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 141 (1976).  Yet courts have never questioned the \nEEOC’s authority to issue its non-binding views interpreting Title VII.  Though such guidance \ndocuments are “entitled to consideration,” id., courts routinely recognize that they lack the force of \nlaw, see EEOC v. SunDance Rehab. Corp., 466 F.3d 490, 500 (6th Cir. 2006); In re Union Pacific R.R. Emp. \nPracs. Litig., 479 F.3d 936, 943 (8th Cir. 2007); McMenemy v. City of Rochester, 241 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir. \n2001); see Gen Elec. Co., 429 U.S. at 141 (noting that “interpretative rulings such as the EEOC \nguidelines” are eligible only for deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Other APA Claims Also Fail \nBecause the Guidance is not a legislative rule, Plaintiffs’ other APA claims necessarily fail.  In \nCount 3, Plaintiffs argue that the Guidance is arbitrary and capricious because, in their view, it did not \nadequately account for safety, implementation, or federalism concerns.  See Compl. ¶¶ 180–81; Br. at \n26–29.    Those  arguments  are  misplaced  as,  again,  the  Guidance  merely  summarizes  existing \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 42 of 47     PageID 614\n   \n \nharassment law and does not “attempt to . . . impose new legal obligations on employers with respect \nto any aspect of workplace harassment law, including gender identity discrimination.”  App. 110.  To \nthe extent Plaintiffs have safety, implementation, or federalism concerns about the legal positions cited \nin the Guidance, those concerns stem from the underlying judicial decisions, not the Guidance. \nThe final version of the Guidance also need not have been published in the Federal Register.  \nSee Compl. ¶¶ 187–89 (Count 4); Br. at 29–30 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D)).  The “courts have \nconsistently required that agencies publish their rules and policy statements only if they constitute a \nchange from the existing law, policy or practice.”  Knutzen v. Eben Ezer Lutheran Hous. Ctr., 815 F.2d \n1343, 1351 (10th Cir. 1987).   The Guidance here does not reflect a change in policy; it is merely a \nnon-comprehensive resource that describes (with citations) how Title VII has been interpreted and \napplied  with  respect  to  elements  of  a  hostile  work  environment  claim,  and  that  conveys  the \nCommission’s position on those issues.  See App. 110–12.  The “proposed guidance did not attempt \nto—nor does the final guidance attempt to—impose new legal obligations on employers with respect \nto any aspect of workplace harassment law, including gender identity discrimination.”  App. 110.  The \nfinal version therefore need not have been published in the Federal Register. \nEven assuming the Guidance were subject to a publication requirement, Plaintiffs do not \njustify their assertion that the Guidance itself is unlawful as a result.  The Freedom of Information \nAct supplies its own remedy when a “matter required to be published in the Federal Register” is “not \nso published.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1).  In such a circumstance, “a person may not in any manner be \nrequired to resort to, or be adversely affected by,” the matter “[e]xcept to the extent that a person has \nactual and timely notice of the terms thereof.”  Id.  For all the reasons previously explained, the \nGuidance cannot “adversely affect[]” any person because it is merely explanatory of legal duties \nimposed by Title VII.  But even if the Court were to disagree with that, the statute plainly contemplates \ncircumstances in which a rule may be applied even though it did not meet a publication requirement.  \nSee Tearney v. Nat’l Transp. Safety Bd., 868 F.2d 1451, 1454 (5th Cir. 1989) (explaining that a rule was \n“enforceable against” pilots “despite any failure of publication of the rule in the Federal Register” \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 43 of 47     PageID 615\n   \n \nbecause they had “actual notice of [the] rule”).  Although the APA did not require it, the Commission \nsubmitted the proposed Guidance to notice and comment by publishing a notice in the Federal \nRegister pursuant to its internal regulations governing the promulgation of guidance documents.  88 \nFed. Reg. 67,750; see 29 C.F.R. § 1695.6.  Texas submitted a comment.  See Br. at 5; App. 3.  Plaintiffs \ncannot, therefore, seriously contend that they lack “actual and timely notice of the terms” of the \nGuidance.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1); see also United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 933 (5th Cir. 2011) (finding \nagency’s adoption of rule without notice and comment constituted harmless error).  \nIII.  The Court Should Reject Plaintiffs’ Requests for Overbroad Relief \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiffs’  claims  lack  merit,  and  the  Court  should  grant \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.  But if the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiffs prevail on any of their claims, the Court should tailor any relief appropriately.  Under \nArticle III, a court’s “constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people \nappearing before it.” Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 72 (2018).  Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit has recently \nemphasized that “[a] plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury,” \nincluding where the plaintiff prevails on an APA claim.  Cargill v. Garland, 57 F.4th 447, 472 (5th Cir. \n2023) (quoting Gill, 585 U.S. at 73), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 374 (2023) (Mem.), and aff’d, 602 U.S. 406 \n(2024).  Consistent with these principles, if the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have prevailed on any \nof their claims, it should limit relief—whether pursuant to the APA, the Declaratory Judgment Act, \nor equitable authority to grant injunctive relief—to any party that has established standing and to any \nportions of the Guidance the Court concludes are invalid.   \nA.  Any Relief Should Be Limited to Parties That Have Established Standing \nPlaintiffs do not argue that universal relief is necessary to redress their alleged injuries.  To the \nextent they suggest that relief pursuant to Section 706 of the APA must always extend beyond the \nparties, see Br. at 30–31 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 706), they are mistaken.  It is well established that Congress’s \nauthorization for courts to issue a remedy “hardly suggests an absolute duty” to grant such relief \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 44 of 47     PageID 616\n   \n \n“under any and all circumstances.”  Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944).  Rather, a statutory \nremedial provision should be construed consistent with “the traditions of equity practice,” “[t]he \nessence” of which reflects “the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the \nnecessities of the particular case.”  Id.  The Supreme Court recently reinforced this principle of \ninterpretation, instructing that, “[w]hen Congress empowers courts to grant equitable relief, there is a \nstrong presumption that courts will exercise that authority in a manner consistent with traditional \nprinciples of equity.”  Starbucks Corp. v. McKinney, 144 S. Ct. 1570, 1576 (2024).  And the Court \nexplained in Starbucks that even seemingly mandatory statutory language—such as a directive “that an \ninjunction ‘shall be granted’ if” certain conditions are met—will not “supplant the traditional equitable \nprinciples” governing relief.  Id. at 1577.  “[S]uch an abrupt departure from traditional equity practice” \nas requiring relief no matter the equities would require “plain[er]” language than that.  Id. \nAccordingly, when Congress provided in the APA that “[t]he reviewing court shall . . . hold \nunlawful and set aside [unlawful] agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), it did not compel courts to abandon \n“the bedrock practice of case-by-case judgments with respect to the parties in each case.”  United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 695 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judgment).  Plaintiffs’ cited cases are \nnot to the contrary.  See Br. at 30–31.  Cargill, in particular, forecloses any argument that any substantive \nAPA violation automatically warrants universal relief.  There, the en banc Fifth Circuit held that an \nagency rule exceeded the agency’s statutory authority and remanded the case to the district court to \n“determine what remedy—injunctive, declarative, or otherwise—is appropriate to effectuate that \njudgment,” including “a more limited remedy” than universal vacatur.  Cargill, 57 F.4th at 450, 472.  If \nuniversal vacatur were the automatic remedy for any substantive APA violation, then remand would \nhave been improper.  In Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Becerra, the Fifth Circuit stated in dicta that “[v]acatur \nis the only statutorily prescribed remedy for a successful APA challenge to a regulation.”  47 F.4th \n368, 374–75 (5th Cir. 2022).  But the court of appeals subsequently held squarely in Cargill that APA \nrelief may operate only as to the parties.  Finally, in Braidwood Management, Inc. v. Becerra, the court of \nappeals again addressed the scope of APA relief in dicta and acknowledged that the Cargill court had \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 45 of 47     PageID 617\n   \n \nremanded to district court for briefing on the appropriate scope of any relief under the APA.  104 \nF.4th 930, 952 n.102 (5th Cir. 2024), petition for cert. filed, No. 24-475 (U.S. Oct. 30, 2024).  As noted, \nplaintiffs’ insistence that automatic, universal relief is required for violations of Section 706 cannot be \nsquared with Cargill, even for substantive violations.  Thus, taken together, these cases stand for the \nproposition that in an APA case—no less than any other case—a court should grant relief no broader \nin scope than necessary to vindicate the particular injuries at issue. \nIn this action, equitable principles counsel strongly in favor of limiting relief to any Plaintiff \nthat has established standing.   The practical problems associated with overbroad, universal relief—\nwhether in the form of a nationwide injunction or universal vacatur—are by now well known.  Such \noverbroad remedies “circumvent normal judicial processes,” including the requirements of joinder or \nclass certification to “seek relief for a larger group of persons.”  Labrador v. Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 927 \n(2024) (Mem.) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  They “effectively transform[] a limited dispute between a \nsmall number of parties . . . into a far more consequential referendum on the law’s every provision as \napplied to anyone.”  Id.  Moreover, overbroad remedies “take a toll on the federal court system” as a \nwhole, by “preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum \nshopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.”  \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 713 (2018) (Thomas J., concurring); see also Arizona, 40 F.4th at 396 \n(Sutton, C.J., concurring) (noting that universal remedies “short-circuit the decisionmaking benefits \nof having different courts weigh in on vexing questions of law and allowing the best ideas to percolate \nto the top”).  Thus, even to the extent that such remedies are permissible, courts “would be wise to \ntake heed” of the problems they create and to “return to a more piecemeal and deliberative judicial \nprocess.”  Labrador, 144 S. Ct. at 927–28 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nUniversal relief would be particularly harmful here, because it would forestall meaningful \nreview in a separate challenge to the Guidance that currently is pending in another court, depriving  \nany decision in that case of practical effect.  See Tennessee v. EEOC, No. 3:24-cv-00224 (E.D. Tenn.).  \nIt likewise would disincentivize any other actions that may be filed with respect to the Guidance.  By \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 46 of 47     PageID 618\n   \n \ncontrast, properly limited relief allows percolation of “competing views” to continue, which in turn \n“aids th[e] [Supreme] Court’s own decisionmaking process.”  DHS v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 \n(2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  This Court should not effectively “freeze[] the debate” over the \nGuidance’s validity “for all lower court judges” by invalidating it universally, notwithstanding that \n“[r]easonable jurists may sometimes reach different outcomes on the merits of tough questions.”  \nArizona, 40 F.4th at 396 (Sutton, C.J., concurring).   \nPlaintiffs’ request for a declaration that sex harassment under Title VII can never include claims \nregarding misgendering, dress codes, or bathroom use is contradicted by the very cases cited in the \nGuidance and in this brief.  Those cases demonstrate that different jurists have reached different \nconclusions on the issues in this case.  And at least one court of appeals has held that harassment \nagainst a transgender individual includes some of the conduct that is the subject of Plaintiffs’ challenge \nin this case. See Copeland, 97 F.4th at 779.  “Principles of comity require that, once a sister circuit has \nspoken to an issue, that pronouncement is the law of that geographical area.”  United States v. AMC \nEnt., Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 773 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Feller v. Brock, 802 F.2d 722, 728 (4th Cir. 1986) \n(district court abused discretion in issuing injunction that frustrated “underlying policy of judicial \nadministration which counsels against the creation of conflicts” between courts).  Moreover, one judge \nin the Northern District of Texas has found that a case involving harassment of a transgender \nemployee that included misgendering could make out a prima facie case of harassment under Title \nVII.  See Garrett, 2024 WL 3237184, at *4, *6.  Accordingly, any relief involving Title VII itself would \nbe inappropriate.   \nB.  Any Relief Should Be Limited to Any Invalid Portions of the Guidance  \nAny relief also should be limited to any portion or portions of the Guidance that the Court \nconcludes are unlawful.  As noted, the Guidance is a 189-page document that addresses harassment \nbased on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information and the \nstandards for determining whether a defendant is liable for violating the statutes that the EEOC \n37 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 35     Filed 11/13/24      Page 47 of 47     PageID 619\n   \n \nadministers.  Plaintiffs challenge only a few phrases of the Guidance, namely its statements (with \ncitations to supporting case law) that harassing conduct, which may or may not give rise to a Title VII \nviolation depending on the totality of circumstances, may include: “harassing conduct because an \nindividual does not present in a manner that would stereotypically be associated with that person’s \nsex; repeated and intentional use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with the individual’s known \ngender identity (misgendering); or the denial of access to a bathroom or other sex-segregated facility \nconsistent with the individual’s gender identity.”  App. 35 (footnotes omitted).  If the Court grants \nany relief, it should be limited in scope to any challenged statement or example in the Guidance that \nthe Court concludes is unlawful.  See, e.g., Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. EPA, 920 F.3d 999, 1033 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(vacating only “the portions of the final rule” that the court decided were unlawful). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied, and \nDefendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted. \n \n Dated: November 13, 2024  Respectfully submitted, \n \nBRIAN M.

Amici routinely participate in cases before federal district and appellate courts to \nadvance the rights and protections of women, girls, and LGBTQI+ people. The relief Plaintiffs \nseek in this case would undermine efforts to combat widespread workplace discrimination \nagainst transgender and nonbinary individuals that causes them direct and devastating harm. \nAmici thus submit this brief in support of Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ shortsighted \nrequest. A listing of amici curiae and their statements of interest is attached as Appendix A. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn its April 2024 Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace (“Harassment \nGuidance”), ECF No. 31 (App. 19),1 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(“EEOC”) reminds employers across the country to do something both simple and totally free: \nnot disrespect the basic humanity of their employees and not allow coworkers to do so either. \nThis request—well within bounds of the agency’s authority and Supreme Court precedent—\nextends to all workers of every color, creed, and sex. In asking this Court to single out \ntransgender and nonbinary workers for lesser treatment, Plaintiffs seek to deny them the same \nbasic respect and humanity afforded their coworkers. This Court should deny that request. \nTitle VII’s broad remedial mandate prohibits sex discrimination against “any individual” \nin hiring, firing, or the “terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a)(1). The Supreme Court has long recognized that this prohibition includes sex-based \n \n1 Also available at https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-\nworkplace. \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 7 of 37     PageID 732\nharassment, including same-sex harassment and “harassing conduct [not] motivated by sexual \ndesire.” Meritor Sav. Bank FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64-66 (1986); Oncale v. Sundowner \nOffshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78, 80 (1998).  \nIn Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court confirmed that Title VII’s prohibitions \nextend to transgender and nonbinary people because an individual’s gender identity is \n“inextricably bound up with sex.” 590 U.S. 644, 655, 658, 660-61, 669 (2020). The EEOC’s \nHarassment Guidance operationalizes that mandate, providing that “sex-based harassment \nincludes harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including how that identity is \nexpressed,” and detailing examples to guide Title VII enforcement efforts. Dkt. No. 1-1 at 17. \nDespite Title VII’s plain language and the Supreme Court’s holding in Bostock, \ntransgender and nonbinary workers endure widespread and severe workplace harassment because \nof their gender identity. By one measure, 70% of transgender workers reported experiencing \ndiscrimination or harassment in the past year alone.2 This harassment can take a variety of forms, \nincluding but not limited to intentional misgendering, epithets, physical and sexual assault, \nthreats, property damage, stereotyping, and denial of access to bathrooms and other facilities. As \nnumerous recent court decisions illustrate, transgender and nonbinary workers frequently \nexperience gender-identity-based harassment in multiple forms, often at the same time and for an \nextended period. The widespread and severe harassment these workers suffer harms not only \ntheir access to employment opportunities, but also their mental, physical, and financial \nwellbeing.  \n \n2 Caroline Medina & Lindsay Mahowald, Discrimination and Barriers to Well-Being: The State \nof the LGBTQI+ Community in 2022, CTR. FOR AM. PROGRESS (Jan. 12, 2023), \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/discrimination-and-barriers-to-well-being-the-state-of-\nthe-lgbtqi community-in-2022/. \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 8 of 37     PageID 733\nGranting Plaintiffs’ requested relief by vacating the Harassment Guidance and issuing a \npermanent injunction would exacerbate these harms by singling out transgender and nonbinary \nworkers for greater risk of continued and increased harassment. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment (Dkt. No. 29) should be denied. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Harassment Guidance Reflects Title VII’s Guarantee of Protection Against \nGender-Identity-Based Workplace Harassment. \nIn Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held that Title VII’s ban on sex-based \ndiscrimination applies to discrimination based on gender identity. 590 U.S. at 683. Writing for \nthe majority, Justice Gorsuch observed, “discrimination based on … transgender status \nnecessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.” Id. \nat 669. The EEOC’s Harassment Guidance seeks only to implement Bostock by giving \nemployers concrete guidance as to when gender-identity-based harassment is actionable under \nTitle VII. It explains, citing Bostock, that “sex-based harassment includes harassment based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity, including how that identity is expressed.” Harassment \nGuidance at 17. It lists specific forms of “[h]arassing conduct based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity” and provides two detailed examples, including one illustrating “Harassment \nBased on Gender Identity.” Id. at 17-18. \nThe Plaintiffs’ arguments that the Harassment Guidance conflicts with Title VII and \nBostock, or otherwise exceeds the agency’s authority, are meritless. Plaintiffs’ efforts to restrict \nBostock’s holding only to the firing of workers, see Dkt. No. 30 at 14-15, are irreconcilable with \nthe decision’s broad holding, which rested on Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in the \n“terms, conditions, and privileges of employment” and recognized no such limitation. See \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 670 (“As enacted, Title VII prohibits all forms of discrimination because of \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 9 of 37     PageID 734\nsex, however they may manifest themselves or whatever other labels might attach to them.”) \n(emphasis added).  \nNor is it remotely correct that the Harassment Guidance “turned Title VII’s prohibition \non sex discrimination into an accommodation mandate” and requires employers to treat \ntransgender employees more favorably than other employees (Dkt. No. 30 at 19-21). Far from \nrequiring Plaintiffs to make exceptions to “longstanding work rules” related to the use of \npronouns, dress codes, and access to restrooms (Dkt. No. 30 at 17), the Harassment Guidance \nexplains how the failure to apply these policies consistently to all employees, regardless of their \ngender identity, could contribute to a hostile work environment. The Harassment Guidance \npatently does not treat transgender employees more favorably than other workers—it makes clear \nthat Title VII’s protection against sex-based discrimination extends equally to all workers, \nregardless of their gender identity. See Harassment Guidance at 93 (“As a form of sex \ndiscrimination, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity therefore \nviolates section 703(a)(1) on the same terms as any other form of sex discrimination, including \nfailing or refusing to hire, or otherwise discriminating against an individual with respect to \ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”). \n Simply put, the EEOC’s Harassment Guidance creates no new substantive rights for \ntransgender and nonbinary workers; it merely explains the proper application of Title VII, per \nBostock, to guide enforcement efforts. The Harassment Guidance falls well within the EEOC’s \nstatutory authority and represents a crucial effort by the agency to effectuate Title VII’s promise \nof a harassment-free workplace for everyone, including the many transgender and nonbinary \nworkers who continue to endure unlawful harassment based on their gender identity. \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 10 of 37     PageID 735\nII.  The Plaintiffs’ Requested Relief Would Harm the Public Interest by Creating \nConfusion About the Application of Title VII and Leaving Workers More \nVulnerable to Harassment. \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to vacate and enjoin the entire Harassment Guidance. Granting \nthe requested relief would cause serious, long-lasting harm to workers, and therefore to the \npublic interest. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (factors of hardship and public \ninterest merge when the Government is the non-moving party).  \nThe EEOC issued its Harassment Guidance to help protect all employees from unlawful \nworkplace discrimination, including harassment on the basis of gender identity. EEOC data \nmakes clear that workplace harassment remains a pervasive problem. For example, the EEOC \nreceived 31,354 charges alleging harassment in Fiscal Year 2023 alone, representing a \nsignificant uptick in complaints from previous years.3  Within this context, the Harassment \nGuidance—which had not been updated since 1999—is an important resource for workers and \nemployers seeking to understand Title VII’s application to the modern workplace, and for agency \nstaff enforcing Title VII’s protections. See Harassment Guidance at 8. Granting the relief \nPlaintiffs seek would deprive workers and employers of this needed resource. And it would leave \nmany workers, especially transgender and nonbinary workers, more vulnerable to discrimination. \nA.  The Harassment Guidance provides practical advice about the application of \nTitle VII and Bostock. \nThe Harassment Guidance protects workers’ rights by helping employers and employees \nunderstand how Title VII applies to real-life situations. It provides detailed explanations and \nexamples of the various legally protected characteristics under federal equal employment \n \n3 Enforcement and Litigation Statistics, U.S. EQUAL EMP. OPPORTUNITY COMM’N, \nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/data/enforcement-and-litigation-statistics-0. EEOC received 31,354 \ncharges alleging harassment in FY2023, as compared with 24,430 in FY2022, 21,720 in FY2021, \n24,221 in FY2020, and 26,221 in FY 2019.  \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 11 of 37     PageID 736\nopportunity law, which are intended to reflect the diversity of the country’s workforce. It \nillustrates how unlawful harassment may manifest in the workplace, including in cases of \nintersectional harassment, harassment that occurs online, harassment by third parties, and \nharassment that occurs outside of the workplace but nonetheless creates a hostile work \nenvironment. It also explains the legal standards for assessing when harassment may violate \nfederal law. Employers can use the information in the Harassment Guidance to help prevent, \nidentify, and address unlawful workplace harassment. \nIn its discussion of sex harassment, the Harassment Guidance addresses Bostock and \nprovides examples of prohibited harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \nHarassment Guidance at 17-18. The Harassment Guidance’s explanation of Bostock’s practical \napplication plainly benefits both employers and employees, given the widespread and harmful \neffects of gender-identity-based discrimination on transgender and nonbinary workers. The \nclarity the Guidance provides is particularly important because many states look to Title VII for \nguidance in interpreting their state anti-discrimination laws, so its value will extend to clarifying \nstate-law EEO protections for workers in these states. See, e.g., Henderson v. Simmons Foods, \nInc., 217 F.3d 612, 615 n.3 (8th Cir. 2000) (“Claims premised under the Arkansas Civil Rights \nAct of 1993 are analyzed in the same manner as Title VII claims. See Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-\n103(c).”); Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 400 F.3d 341, 347 (6th Cir. 2005) (“A sexual \nharassment claim brought under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act (‘KRCA’) is to be analyzed in \nthe same manner as a claim brought under Title VII, its federal counterpart.”) (citing Ammerman \nv. Bd. of Educ. of Nicholas Cnty., 30 S.W.3d 793, 797-98 (Ky. 2000)); Stennis v. Bowie State \nUniv., 236 F. Supp. 3d 903, 910 (D. Md. 2017) (observing Maryland’s Fair Employment \nPractices Act “is the ‘state law analogue of Title VII and its interpretation is guided by federal \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 12 of 37     PageID 737\ncases interpreting Title VII.’”), aff’d in relevant part, 716 F. App’x 164 (4th Cir. 2017) (citation \nomitted); Shiyan Jiang v. Tex. Comm’n on Env’t Quality, 321 F. Supp. 3d 738, 745 n.3 (W.D. \nTex. 2018) (noting that the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act  (‘TCHRA’) “was modeled \nafter federal civil rights law and has as an express purpose to provide for the execution of the \npolicies of Title VII,” and “Texas courts look to analogous federal precedent for guidance when \ninterpreting the TCHRA.”) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \nB.  The Harassment Guidance is critically needed because discrimination, including \nharassment, against transgender and nonbinary workers is widespread. \nAs both data and individuals’ experiences reflect, gender-identity-based workplace \nharassment is widespread, takes many forms, and causes serious, long-lasting harm to \ntransgender and nonbinary workers. Within this context, the Harassment Guidance is critical to \nensuring that these workers receive the full measure of Title VII’s protection from unlawful \ndiscrimination, especially in light of growing animus toward the LGBTQI+ community.  \n1.  Workplace harassment remains widespread even after Bostock. \nDespite Bostock’s clear rejection of gender-identity-based discrimination, transgender \nand nonbinary workers continue to be subjected to workplace harassment based on gender \nidentity at staggering rates, demonstrating the critical need for the EEOC’s clear explanation of \nprohibited behavior in its Harassment Guidance.   \nIn a 2022 survey, 70% of transgender respondents reported experiencing some form of \nworkplace discrimination or harassment in the past year because of their sexual orientation, \ngender identity, or intersex status.4 In another survey conducted one year after Bostock, 43.8% of \ntransgender respondents reported verbal harassment at work, 26.3% reported sexual harassment \n \n4 Medina & Mahowald, supra note 2. \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 13 of 37     PageID 738\nat work, and 28.2% reported physical harassment at work.5 These survey results mirror a 2015 \nsurvey in which 23% of transgender respondents who held a job in the past year reported that \ntheir employer, boss, or coworkers had taken specific negative actions against them in the past \nyear because they were transgender. These include (i) their boss or coworker sharing their \nprivate, personal information, such as their transgender status (16%), (ii) their boss giving them a \nnegative review (6%), (iii) being told to present as a gender different from their gender identity \n(4%), (iv) not being allowed to use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity (4%),6 and \n(v) being forced to transfer to a different position or department at their job because they were \ntransgender (2%).7 \nAdditionally, data suggest transgender and nonbinary workers of color and disabled \ntransgender and nonbinary workers are particularly vulnerable to discrimination. LGBTQI+ \nworkers of color and LGBTQI+ workers with disabilities surveyed in 2022 consistently reported \nexperiencing workplace discrimination at higher rates than LGBTQI+ workers who do not \nidentify as people of color or people with disabilities.8 \n2.  Workplace harassment on the basis of gender identity takes a variety of \nforms. \nGender-identity-based workplace harassment can take many forms that may occur \nseparately or, often, in combination. Here, we illustrate just some of the forms harassment can \n \n5 Brad Sears et al., LGBT People’s Experiences of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment, \nTHE WILLIAMS INST., 12 (Sept. 2021), https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Workplace-Discrimination-Sep-2021.pdf. \n6 In a more recent survey from 2022, 23% of transgender respondents reported being denied \naccess to restrooms or other facilities.

Sadly, much workplace \nharassment goes unreported or underreported.9 Transgender and nonbinary workers may be \nparticularly hesitant to report discrimination,10 including harassment, because they may fear \nretaliation or other consequences even from raising concerns with their coworkers or supervisors, \nmuch less reporting them to the media or in legal proceedings. \nTransgender and nonbinary workers are often subjected to intentional misgendering, \nwhich is the purposeful and repeated use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with that individual’s \ngender identity. See, e.g., Copeland v. Ga. Dep’t of Corr., 97 F.4th 766, 771 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(plaintiff, a transgender man and sergeant employed by the Georgia Department of Corrections, \nwas misgendered on a daily basis by supervisors and subordinates over the prison-wide radio \nsystem so that all employees at the facility could hear it; in addition, he was repeatedly \nmisgendered and subjected to inappropriate comments about his gender in interactions off the \nradio); Eller v. Prince George’s Cnty. Pub. Sch., 580 F. Supp. 3d 154, 162-65 (D.

In a recent case, James Lammers, a nonbinary \nindividual working as a mental health counselor, experienced invasive questioning and \nharassment at the residential treatment facility where they worked. Lammers v. Pathways To a \nBetter Life, LLC, No. 18-C-1579, 2021 WL 3033370, at *1 (E.D. Wisc. 2021). Lammers’s \nofficemate “frequently asked [] questions about various aspects of [Lammers’s] gender \nnonconformity, including [their] physiology, [their] clothing, [their] relationship with [their] \nwife, and [their] family life in general.” Id. at *2. Staff “regularly gossiped and frequently made \njokes about how Lammers was weird and … would regularly treat Lammers differently than \nother staff.” Id. Residents frequently made crude and offensive jokes about Lammers’ gender \nidentity. Id. Lammers made complaints about their officemate and the comments from residents, \nbut their employer never did anything to address the gender-identity-based harassment Lammers \nsuffered—and instead fired Lammers. Id. \nGender-identity-based harassment can also take the form of physical assault, including \nshoving, grabbing, unwanted touching, hitting, and sexual assault. For example, in one survey, a \nnonbinary individual reported that their former boss and co-workers sexually abused them to \n“prove [they’re] not into guys.”17 In another instance, a transgender woman was beaten and had \nher head hit against a trash can when she was taking out the trash at work.18 In another, a \ntransgender firefighter’s coworkers barricaded her in a burning room so hot it melted her \nprotective gear and gave her second- and third-degree burns, and as she burned, her coworkers \ncalled her a “freak” and said her she was not welcome in the fire department.

The \nphysical harassment that transgender and nonbinary workers suffer in the workplace reflects the \nheightened rates of physical and sexual violence against such individuals in general. One study \nfound that transgender individuals are over four times more likely than cisgender people to \nexperience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple \nassaults.19 \nTransgender and nonbinary workers additionally face express threats of physical and \nsexual violence. In one recent case, students physically assaulted a transgender teacher on \nmultiple occasions and threatened her with sexual assault. A student also threatened to burn her \nhouse down “because she was ‘not really a person.’” See Eller, 580 F. Supp. 3d at 163-65, 173. \nIn another case, a coworker confronted a transgender correctional officer, blocked the prison’s \nentrance, and threatened to fight him because he had corrected colleagues who misgendered him. \nCopeland, 97 F.4th at 772.

Some workers are forced to use a bathroom that is inconsistent with their \naffirmed gender—a situation so uncomfortable it can cause transgender people to avoid using the \nbathroom at all.20 This can lead to immediate physical consequences. For example, as the Third \nCircuit has explained, workers may “avoid going to the bathroom by fasting, dehydrating, or \notherwise forcing themselves not to use the restroom throughout the day,” which can then cause \nurinary tract infections and other health problems. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d \n518, 523 (3rd Cir. 2018); see also Membreno v. Atlanta Rest. Partners, 517 F. Supp. 3d 425, 431 \n(D. Md. 2021) (plaintiff, a transgender woman working at a restaurant, was prohibited from \nusing the women’s restroom and “berated” when she did use it, leading her to avoid using the \nrestroom and “limit the amount of water she drank while working”). Others are refused access to \nany bathroom or are restricted to using only single-stall or gender-neutral bathrooms. For \nexample, a human resources manager required “Jane,” a transgender woman from Missouri, to \nuse the single-stall restroom rather than the women’s restroom at her workplace. Because there \nwas only one single-stall restroom in her workplace, Jane was forced to wait when the restroom \nwas occupied, being cleaned, or under maintenance, while other women at the company were \nable to use any of the twenty-eight women’s restrooms without waiting.21 This is a pernicious \nform of discrimination because beyond the physical consequences of having to wait a long time \n \n20 Meredith Russo, What It Feels Like to Use the Wrong Bathroom, N.Y.

See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, \n490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989) (plurality opinion) (“In the specific context of sex stereotyping, an \nemployer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must \nnot be, has acted on the basis of gender.”); E.E.O.C. v.

For example, in one case, a transgender \nwoman working as a truck driver was harassed by a co-worker on multiple occasions because \nshe wore clothing considered to be traditionally feminine. The co-worker told her “I wish you \nwouldn’t do that because you are making us look bad,” asked, “Can’t you just dress like a \nman?”, and told her, “You make for an ugly woman.” Parker v.

Growing animus and rising violence against transgender and nonbinary \npeople underscore the importance of the Harassment Guidance. \nThe EEOC’s Harassment Guidance is particularly important in light of the overall climate \nof hostility and violence that transgender and nonbinary people now face in their daily lives. \nBlocking the Harassment Guidance could further fuel this animus and undermine efforts to \nenforce Title VII’s prohibition against workplace harassment. \nHate crimes based on gender identity have risen dramatically in recent years. The FBI \nrecorded 469 hate crimes motivated by gender identity in 2022 alone, a nearly 32% increase \nfrom the previous year.24 Growing animus is also reflected in the increase in anti-LGBTQI+ bills \nintroduced in state legislatures around the country.25 More than 550 anti-LGBTQ bills were \n \n23 Lily Zheng, Transgender, Gender-Fluid, Nonbinary, and Gender-Nonconforming Employees \nDeserve Better Policies, HARVARD BUS.

Cisgender women have been “questioned, verbally assaulted, \nfollowed, and even forcibly removed from facilities” because they were mistaken for transgender \nwomen or were perceived as too masculine to use the spaces.27 In this landscape of heightened \nviolence and backlash, the Harassment Guidance provides essential clarification for businesses \nand employees alike.  \nC.  Gender-identity-based harassment harms transgender and nonbinary workers’ \nmental and physical well-being and can force them out of the workplace. \nInstances of discrimination and harassment like those described in Section II.B.2—such \nas misgendering, the use of epithets, physical and sexual assault, and other differential treatment \nfrom cisgender employees—have measurably negative effects on transgender workers.28 In a \n \n26 Mapping Attacks on LGBTQ Rights in U.S. State Legislatures in 2024, AM.

Covering is a form of forced assimilation and \n“refers to refers to ways in which individuals downplay known disfavored identities to blend into \nthe mainstream.”33 In one study, 68% of transgender and nonbinary workers reported covering in \nthe workplace.34  For example, transgender and nonbinary workers may cover by “changing their \nphysical appearance; changing when, where, or how frequently they use the bathroom; and \navoiding talking about their personal families or social lives while at work.”35 But covering \ncomes at a cost. Seventy-four percent of workers of any identity who engaged in covering \nbehaviors reported that the need to cover at work negatively impacted them, including 60% who \nreported it negatively impacted their overall well-being and 54% who reported it negatively \naffected their ability to perform their job to the best of their ability.36   \nDiscrimination also forces some transgender and nonbinary workers out of their jobs \nentirely. One study found that 15% of transgender respondents who held a job in the past year \nreported that they quit their job to avoid workplace discrimination.37 Ensuring that transgender \nand nonbinary workers are safe at work and can maintain their employment without confronting \nthe risk of gender-identity-based harassment is particularly important, given that transgender and \n \n33 Joanne Stephane et al., Uncovering culture: A call to action for leaders, DELOITTE  DEV.

The Balance of Equities Weighs Against the Requested Relief. \nThe Plaintiffs will suffer no harm if the Harassment Guidance remains in effect. The \ndocument simply provides guidance on the application of Title VII and Bostock in the \nworkplace. It does not impose any new obligations or costs on the Plaintiffs. It merely asks them \nto comply with existing federal law and explains how to do so. \nNor does the Harassment Guidance cause any harm to other workers. Plaintiffs argue that \nEEOC’s failure to consider “the risk to women’s safety” posed by allowing transgender workers \nto access restrooms and other facilities consistent with their affirmed gender is grounds for \n“setting aside the 2024 Guidance as arbitrary and capricious” (Dkt. 30 at 27). But the \nHarassment Guidance poses no threat to the safety of women in the workplace.

Special Sch. Dist., No. 1, 294 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that a school \ndistrict’s policy of allowing a transgender teacher to use the women’s faculty restroom did not \ncreate a hostile work environment for other teachers). And it certainly poses no risk to the safety \nof other workers to refer to their coworkers using the correct names and pronouns, or to refrain \nfrom harassing their coworkers based on how they dress. To the contrary, the Harassment \nGuidance helps ensure a safe and productive working environment for all workers. \nNotwithstanding all of the foregoing, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants will suffer no \nharm if the requested relief is granted. They could not be more wrong. Enjoining the Harassment \nGuidance would cause tremendous harm—it would create widespread confusion about the scope \nof employers’ obligations and workers’ protections under Title VII, undermine the EEOC’s \nefforts to prevent and address workplace harassment, make transgender and nonbinary workers \nmore vulnerable to harassment, and discourage workers from reporting harassing behavior by \ncreating uncertainty about their rights and legal protections. Moreover, insofar as the Plaintiffs \nask this Court to enjoin enforcement of Title VII against them with respect to gender-identity-\nbased harassment, such relief would leave Plaintiffs’ employees without clear recourse for \nharassment based on gender identity. Plaintiffs have no legitimate interest in denying any \nworker, including transgender and nonbinary workers, the protection of an existing federal anti-\n \nd27fbbcb.pdf; see also Julie Moreau, No link between trans-inclusive policies and bathroom \nsafety, study finds, NBC News (Sept. 19, 2018),  \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/no-link-between-trans-inclusive-policiesbathroom-\nsafety-study-finds-n911106. \n41 Hasenbush et al., supra note 40; see also Am.

For the foregoing reasons, amici respectfully ask this Court to deny Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Summary Judgment and refuse to enjoin enforcement of the Harassment Guidance. \n \nDated: November 20, 2024  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/Elizabeth E.

Since its founding in 1972, NWLC has worked to advance educational opportunities, \nworkplace justice, health and reproductive rights, and income security. This work has included \nparticipating in numerous cases before all levels of federal and state courts to ensure that rights \nand opportunities are not restricted based on sex. Given that discrimination based on transgender \nstatus is necessarily linked to harmful sex stereotypes, NWLC has a particular interest in \nensuring that discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals, including against transgender and \nnonbinary individuals, is not perpetuated in the name of women’s rights. \nActors’ Equity Association: Actors’ Equity Association (“Equity”), a labor organization \nthat represents live theatrical actors and stage managers, is devoted to protecting live theatre as \nan essential component of a thriving civil society and the basis of its members’ livelihoods. Since \nl913, Equity has fought to win its members a dignified workplace at the theatre, from pay \nguarantees and pension and welfare benefits to the rules governing auditions. With more than \n51,000 members across the nation, Equity is among the oldest and largest labor unions in the \nperforming arts in America. Broadway tours of America’s favorite musicals come to every major \nmarket in the United States. Equity members live and work in every state in the United States \nand many members travel frequently throughout the country for work. Preserving protections for \ntransgender and non-binary workers is critical to the ability of Equity’s diverse membership to \nwork in live theatre throughout the country.  \nA-1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 31 of 37     PageID 756\nAdvocates for Transgender Equality Education Fund: Advocates for Transgender \nEquality Education Fund (“A4TE”) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for the \nrights of transgender and nonbinary individuals across the United States. A4TE, through its \npredecessor organizations National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and Transgender \nLegal Defense and Education Fund (TLDEF), has appeared as amici in cases regarding \ntransgender rights in a wide range of state and federal courts at all levels. A4TE seeks to achieve \nfull lived equality for the transgender and nonbinary community through impact litigation, policy \nadvocacy, and education. A4TE’s efforts focus on critical areas such as employment, healthcare, \nhousing, conditions of confinement, education, identity documents, and public accommodations.  \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union: The American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”) is a \nnationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization with more than three million members dedicated \nto defending the principles of liberty and equality embodied in the Constitution and the civil \nrights laws. As an organization that advocates for First Amendment liberties as well as equal \nrights for LGBTQ+ people, the ACLU has a strong interest in protecting those individuals from \non-the-job harassment and abuse, and has appeared as counsel-of-record or amici in many cases \ninvolving the application of nondiscrimination protections to transgender and LGBQ people, \nincluding as counsel for Aimee Stephens in Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO: \nAmicus American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO \n(“AFSCME”) advocates for fairness in the workplace, excellence in public services and freedom \nand opportunity for all working families. We are a membership association and labor union of \n1.4 million members who serve in hundreds of occupations across the nation—from nurses and \nA-2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 32 of 37     PageID 757\nEMTs, to corrections officers, childcare providers, sanitation workers and more—providing the \nvital services that make America happen.  \nEqual Rights Advocates: Equal Rights Advocates (ERA) is a national non-profit civil \nrights advocacy organization dedicated to protecting and expanding economic and educational \naccess and opportunities for women and girls.  Since its founding in 1974, ERA has sought to \nend gender discrimination and advance equal opportunity for all by litigating high-impact and \nhistorically significant cases, engaging in policy reform and legislative advocacy campaigns, \nconducting community education and outreach, and providing free legal assistance to individuals \nexperiencing unfair treatment at work or in school through our national Advice & Counseling \nprogram. ERA has filed hundreds of suits and appeared as amicus curiae in numerous cases to \ndefend and enforce civil rights in state and federal courts, including before the United States \nSupreme Court.  ERA views discrimination against transgender people – particularly harassment \nand exclusionary policies justified by the very sex stereotypes that have held women back in the \nworkplace and elsewhere – as a pernicious and legally impermissible form of sex discrimination \nthat is harmful to the transgender community, to women, and to our society at large.  \nLambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc.: For 50 years, Lambda Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, Inc. (“Lambda Legal”) has striven to ensure that courts recognize \nand enforce the employment protections LGBTQ workers have under existing federal and state \nlaw. Of special relevance here, Lambda Legal was not only an amicus curiae in Bostock v. \nClayton County, Georgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), it also successfully represented the plaintiff-\nappellant in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, 853 F.3d 339 (7th Cir. 2017) (en \nbanc), and argued as amicus curiae in both Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. \n2018) (en banc), aff’d sub nom. Bostock, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), and Wittmer v. Phillips, 66 Co., \nA-3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 33 of 37     PageID 758\n915 F.3d 328 (5th Cir. 2019). Most recently, Lambda Legal served as counsel for a transgender \nteacher asserting employment sex discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964. See Eller v. Prince George’s Cnty. Pub. Schs., 580 F. Supp. 3d 154 (D. Md. 2022). \nThus, the issues before the Court are of acute concern to Lambda Legal and the community it \nrepresents, who stand to be directly affected by the Court’s ruling.  \nLatinoJustice PRLDEF: For more than fifty years, LatinoJustice PRLDEF \n(“LatinoJustice”), a national civil rights organization, has championed the civil rights of Latinos \nin the workplace, litigating sexual harassment and other employment discrimination cases. \nLatinoJustice regularly engages in impact litigation, representing Latinx and other communities \nin areas including economic justice, immigrant rights, and voting rights. LatinoJustice has \nworked to eliminate barriers that disproportionately burden women and their economic security.   \nLegal Momentum, the Women’s Legal Defense and Education Fund: Legal \nMomentum, the Women’s Legal Defense and Education Fund, is a national non-profit civil \nrights organization that for over 50 years has used the power of the law to define and defend the \nrights of girls and women. Legal Momentum has worked for decades to ensure that all \nemployees are treated fairly in the workplace, regardless of their gender, or sexual orientation. \nLegal Momentum has litigated cutting-edge gender-based employment discrimination cases, \nincluding Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), and has participated as amicus \ncuriae on leading cases in this area, including Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 \n(1998), Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998), and Harris v. Forklift \nSystems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17 (1993).  \nNational Center for Law and Economic Justice: The National Center for Law and \nEconomic Justice (NCLEJ) advances economic justice for low-income families, individuals and \nA-4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 34 of 37     PageID 759\ncommunities across the country through impact litigation, policy advocacy and support of \ngrassroots organizing. NCLEJ works to build systems that provide economic security and full \nparticipation in society for all, including the ability of workers to be free from discrimination and \nretaliation. NCLEJ litigates extensively in state and federal courts to secure the rights of low-\nwage workers, including under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and represents workers in front \nof city and federal agencies in workplace anti-discrimination complaints.  \nNational Council of Jewish Women: National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) is a \ngrassroots organization of 210,000 advocates who turn progressive ideals into action. Inspired by \nJewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, \nchildren, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. NCJW’s Principles \nstate that “Equal rights and equitable opportunities for all people must be guaranteed, and all \nforms of discrimination must be eliminated” and in our Resolutions, we resolve to work for “The \ninclusion and acceptance of all individuals no matter their gender self-identification.” Consistent \nwith our Principles, Resolutions, and longstanding commitment to ending workplace harassment \nand affirming equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, NCJW joins this brief.  \nThe National Employment Lawyers Association and the National Institute for \nWorkers’ Rights: The National Employment Lawyers Association (“NELA”) is the largest \nprofessional membership organization in the country comprising lawyers who represent workers \nin labor, employment and civil rights disputes. Founded in 1985, NELA advances employee \nrights and serves lawyers who advocate for equality and justice in the American workplace. \nNELA and its 69 circuit, state, and local affiliates have a membership of over 4,000 attorneys \nwho are committed to working on behalf of those who have been illegally treated in the \nworkplace. This membership includes residents of Texas who would be adversely impacted by a \nA-5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 35 of 37     PageID 760\nruling against Plaintiffs-Appellants. NELA’s members litigate daily in every circuit, affording \nNELA a unique perspective on how the principles announced by the courts in employment cases \nactually play out on the ground. NELA strives to protect the rights of its members’ clients and \nregularly supports precedent-setting litigation affecting the rights of individuals in the workplace. \nThe mission of the National Institute for Workers’ Rights (“the Institute”) is to advance workers’ \nrights through research, thought leadership, and education for policymakers, advocates, and the \npublic. The Institute aspires to a future in which all workers are treated with dignity and respect; \nworkplaces are equitable, diverse, and inclusive; and the wellbeing of workers is a priority in \nbusiness practices. As the nation’s employee rights advocacy think tank, the Institute influences \nthe broad, macro conversations that shape employment law.  \nNational Employment Law Project: The National Employment Law Project (“NELP”) \nis a national non-profit with over 50 years of experience advocating for the employment and \nlabor rights of low-wage and unemployed workers. NELP seeks to ensure that all employees, and \nespecially the most vulnerable ones, receive access to good jobs and the full protection of labor \nand employment laws. NELP’s community-based partners, including worker centers, unions, and \nother worker-support organizations in communities across the 50 states, have seen the kinds of \nimpacts raised in this case, and would be harmed if the Court rules against the EEOC in this case. \nNELP has litigated and participated as amicus curiae in countless cases in federal circuit and \nstate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court addressing the importance of compliance with \nworkplace protections.  \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence: The National Network to End Domestic \nViolence (NNEDV) represents the 56 U.S. state and territorial coalitions against domestic \nviolence. NNEDV is dedicated to creating a social, political, and economic environment in \nA-6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 36 of 37     PageID 761\nwhich domestic violence no longer exists. NNEDV works to make domestic violence a national \npriority, change the way society responds to domestic violence, and strengthen domestic violence \nadvocacy at every level. NNEDV was instrumental in the passage and implementation of the \nViolence Against Women Act. NNEDV has a strong interest in upholding protections against \ndiscrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, as these protections can allow \npeople of all genders to earn a living and receive protection and support when dealing with \nabuse.   \nThe National Partnership for Women & Families: The National Partnership for \nWomen & Families is a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy group that has over 50 years of \nexperience in combating barriers to equity and opportunity for women. The National Partnership \nworks for a just and equitable society in which all women and families can live with dignity, \nrespect, and security; every person has the opportunity to achieve their potential; and no person \nis held back by discrimination or bias. Our organization has a long history of combating \nworkplace harassment, including successfully litigating Barnes v. Costle, the first sexual \nharassment case in the country; contributing amicus briefs in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, \nthe landmark Supreme Court case recognizing sexual harassment as sex discrimination; and \ntestifying before the Senate on the issue of sexual harassment. As a result of this history, we have \na strong understanding of the history, details and legislative intent informing the law and are \ndeeply invested in ensuring that the promise of the law is comprehensively enforced. In line with \nour mission and expertise, the National Partnership believes that fair labor and employment \npractices, like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s April 2024 Enforcement \nGuidance on Harassment in the Workplace, are critical to women’s ability to succeed and thrive \nin our economy and to building an economy that benefits workers, businesses and the nation as a \nA-7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 46     Filed 11/26/24      Page 37 of 37     PageID 762\nwhole. This is particularly true for women of color, disabled women, LGBTQI+ people, and \nwomen living at the intersection of multiple identities more broadly.  \nService Employees International Union: Amicus Curiae Service Employees \nInternational Union (SEIU) is a labor organization representing approximately two million \nworking people in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico in healthcare, property services, \nand public services. SEIU is committed to the fair and equal treatment of all workers, including \nLGBTQI+ individuals. SEIU strives to ensure that all workers are protected from discrimination \nbecause of sex, including discrimination based on gender identity. SEIU members rely on Title \nVII to enforce their rights to a safe workplace free of discrimination, and therefore have a strong \ninterest in ensuring that EEOC guidance protects all workers from workplace harassment.  \n \n \nA-8 ",

Amici submit this brief to highlight the importance to employers of \nhaving greater clarity regarding their obligations under Title VII and analogous \nfederal workplace-anti-discrimination laws, something that is particularly helpful \nto small businesses like Amici’s members. Amici provide the following statements of \ninterest:  \nSmall Business Majority is a national small business organization that \nempowers America’s diverse entrepreneurs to build a thriving and equitable \neconomy. Small Business Majority engages a network of more than 85,000 small \nbusinesses and 1,500 business and community organizations to deliver resources to \nentrepreneurs and advocate for public policy solutions that promote inclusive small \nbusiness growth. Small Business Majority’s work is bolstered by extensive research \nand deep connections with the small business community. \nMain Street Alliance is a national network of small businesses, which \nrepresents approximately 30,000 small businesses across the United States. MSA \n \n1 No party’s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and no party, party’s \ncounsel, or other person—besides Amici and their counsel—contributed money to the \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 7 of 23     PageID 769\n \nhelps small business owners realize their full potential as leaders for a just future \nthat prioritizes good jobs, equity, and community through organizing, research, and \npolicy advocacy on behalf of small businesses. MSA also seeks to amplify the voices \nof its small business membership by sharing their experiences with the aim of \ncreating an economy where all small business owners have an equal opportunity to \nsucceed. \nThe American Sustainable Business Council is a multi-issue membership \norganization comprised of the business and investor community, which collectively \nrepresents over 200,000 businesses, the majority of which are small and midsized \nbusinesses. ASBC advocates for solutions and policies that support a just, \nsustainable stakeholder economy. Its mission is to educate, connect, and mobilize \nbusiness leaders and investors to transform the public and private sectors and the \noverall economy.2 \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issues guidance to \nensure that employers are aware of their obligations, and employees are aware of \ntheir rights, under the federal workplace civil-rights laws that the EEOC enforces. \nThese include Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title I of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the \nPregnant Workers Fairness Act of 2022, among others.3 Together, these statutes \n \n2 Thousands of Amici’s small-business members are covered by the EEOC’s Guidance. \n3 See EEOC, What Laws Does EEOC Enforce?, https://tinyurl.com/3jtmvpp7. \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 8 of 23     PageID 770\n \nprohibit workplace discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions, sexual \norientation, and gender identity), national origin, disability, genetic information, \nand age.4  \nIn April 2024, following a notice-and-comment period, the EEOC finalized its \nEnforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace—an update of earlier \nenforcement-guidance documents that were more than 25 years old.5 The Guidance \ncovers a range of helpful topics regarding the parameters of the law. For example, \nthe Guidance explains what conduct amounts to unlawful harassment, including \nhow harassment may be based on the expression of traits related to an employee’s \nrace, sex, or other protected characteristic. The Guidance also provides reminders \nregarding employers’ responsibility to address harassment by third parties, like \ncustomers and vendors. And it reminds employers that implementing EEO policies \nand training, including providing multiple avenues for complaints, can help them to \navoid liability in the context of harassment claims.  \nOne key update—and the subject of Plaintiffs’ challenge in this case—is that \nthe Guidance includes now-longstanding federal legal protections for LGBTQ+ \nemployees, and it provides examples of prohibited harassment based on sexual \norientation and gender identity. Plaintiffs reject the Guidance’s reminders that, for \n \n4 Id. \n5  See  EEOC,  Enforcement  Guidance  on  Harassment  in  the  Workplace  (2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3x8efapr.  As  the  Anti-Harassment  Guidance  explains,  it \nconsolidates and supersedes several earlier EEOC policy and enforcement documents \nissued between 1987 and 1999. Id. \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 9 of 23     PageID 771\n \nexample, purposefully and repeatedly misgendering an employee with the wrong \nname or pronouns can be a form of unlawful sex-based harassment, and that \ndenying an employee access to a bathroom or changing room consistent with the \nemployee’s gender identity could amount to unlawful sex-based harassment. See \nPls.’ Br. 14-17, 22-25.   \nPlaintiffs are wrong as a matter of law because, as the EEOC explains, the \nGuidance imposes no new obligations on regulated entities but merely provides \nexamples of harassment that may create hostile work environments, so that \nemployers can work to prevent and address them consistent with Title VII and \nanalogous statutes and relevant precedents. See EEOC Br. 5-7, 22-25. \nAmici write to provide several additional points from the regulated business \ncommunity. First, small businesses benefit from the Anti-Harassment Guidance, \nwhich helps them understand and comply with their obligations under federal civil-\nrights laws. Next, the Guidance is good for business. Complying with civil-rights \nlaws, particularly those that guard against sexual-orientation and gender-identity \nharassment in the face of widespread harassment against LGBTQ+ workers, fosters  \nmore inclusive workplaces. Maintaining a workplace that addresses and prevents \nharassment helps to attract, hire, and retain workers of diverse backgrounds,6 \nimprove worker performance, and reduce turnover—all of which, in return, \nimproves bottom lines, drives business success, and boosts the economy. Further, \n \n6  Amici  use  the  terms  “diverse”  and  “diversity”  herein  to  refer  to  a  range  of \nbackgrounds and identities, including racial, gender, disability, age, and LGBTQ+ \nidentities.    \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 10 of 23     PageID 772\n \ncontrary to Plaintiffs’ arguments, the costs of implementing the Anti-Harassment \nGuidance are minimal. But the costs of enjoining the Guidance are substantial. \nBusinesses appreciate clear guidance, which the Anti-Harassment Guidance \nprovides, to help them comply with the laws by which they are bound. And \nPlaintiffs’ interpretation would lead to the bizarre conclusion that harassment on \nthe basis of a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity would somehow be \nallowed whereas harassment on the basis of any other legally protected class, like \nrace, disability, or religion, would not. Enjoining the Anti-Harassment Guidance \nwould confuse employers about their obligations under federal civil-rights laws. \n Amici urge the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, grant \nthe EEOC’s cross-motion for summary judgment, and allow small businesses and \nemployers around the nation to benefit from the helpful clarifications and examples \ncontained in the Anti-Harassment Guidance. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Anti-Harassment Guidance helps small businesses ensure that \nthey are complying with their obligations under federal workplace \ncivil-rights laws. \nEEOC’s Anti-Harassment Guidance provides—for the first time in 25 years—\nupdated guidance for employers regarding the current legal standards and scope of \nliability applicable to workplace-harassment claims.7 The Guidance reflects several \nadvancements in the law in the intervening decades.  \n \n7 See Anti-Harassment Guidance, supra note 5. \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 11 of 23     PageID 773\n \nIt explains, for example, that race-based harassment may include \nharassment based not just on the fact of an employee’s race, but also “traits or \ncharacteristics linked to an individual’s race,” including an employee’s “name, \ncultural dress, accent or manner of speech, and physical characteristics, including \n. . . hair textures and hairstyles.”8 It provides updates on pregnancy-related \nharassment, including harassment based on things like morning sickness and \nlactation.9 The Guidance explains that employers face liability for harassing \nconduct perpetrated by non-employees and third parties, including that carried out \nby an employer’s independent contractors, clients, or customers.10 And, recognizing \nthe prevalence of remote and hybrid work environments, the Guidance clarifies the \ncontours of harassing conduct that is conveyed via videoconferencing platforms, \nsocial media, and other digital-media sources.    \nThe subject of Plaintiffs’ challenge in this case is the guidance related to \nharassment against LGBTQ+ people in the workplace. In Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty,11 the Supreme Court held that Title VII’s protections against sex  \ndiscrimination includes protections against discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity. Additionally, the EEOC’s history of enforcing Title \nVII to protect LGBTQ+ persons in the workplace goes back to at least 2011 and long \npredates the Supreme Court’s confirmation of these protections in 2020 in \n \n8 Id. \n9 Id. \n10 Id. \n11 590 U.S. 644 (2020). \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 12 of 23     PageID 774\n \nBostock.12 And the EEOC was hardly out on a limb; long before Bostock, federal \ncourts—including in this District—held that Title VII prohibits discrimination \nagainst LGBTQ+ workers.13 In so doing, both the EEOC and courts interpreted \nTitle VII to encompass not just discrimination and harassment based on the fact of \na person’s gender identity or sexual orientation, but also sex harassment stemming \nfrom the expression of those characteristics, including the intentional use of names \nor pronouns inconsistent with the employee’s gender; exclusion from bathrooms, \nchanging rooms, or other sex-segregated facilities that align with the employee’s \ngender; and adherence to dress codes.14 The updated Guidance reflects those \nimportant applications of Title VII’s prohibition on sex harassment against \nLGBTQ+ workers in line with federal court precedents around the nation.  \n \n12 See, e.g., Macy v. Dep’t of Justice, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120821, 2012 WL 1435995 \n(Apr. 20, 2012) (discrimination based on employee’s transgender identity is sex-based \ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII); Baldwin v. Dep’t of Transp., EEOC Appeal \nNo. 0120133080, 2015 WL 4397641 (July 15, 2015) (discrimination based on sexual \norientation is sex-based discrimination in violation of Title VII); see also EEOC, \nFederal-Sector EEO Cases Involving Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity (SOGI) \nDiscrimination, https://tinyurl.com/476w7ah7 (cataloging EEOC decisions from 2011 \nto the present holding that sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination \nviolate Title VII).  \n13 See, e.g., Baker v.

Jan. 20, 2016) (pronoun use); Lusardi v. Dep’t of the Army, \nEEOC Appeal No. 0120133385, 2015 WL 1607756 (Apr. 1, 2015) (pronoun use). \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 13 of 23     PageID 775\n \nThe Guidance addresses each element of a workplace-harassment claim, \nincluding whether and when conduct qualifies as harassing conduct based on an \nemployee’s legally protected characteristic; whether it resulted in a change in the \nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment or created a hostile work \nenvironment; and whether the employer is liable for the conduct. And, crucially, \nthroughout the Guidance, the EEOC has provided 77 examples of hypothetical \nscenarios (including some pertaining to LGBTQ+ workers specifically) to \ndemonstrate the contours of the protections, the type of conduct that rises to the \nlevel of actionable harassment, or not, and remedial or corrective actions that an \nemployer should take in response to a given situation.15   \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ insistence, the Guidance breaks no new legal ground. \nThe Guidance is just that—explanatory guidance to help employers ensure that \nthey are complying with existing federal workplace civil-rights laws and to help \nemployees understand their rights and protections under these laws. Employers, \nincluding many of Amici’s members, use this information to inform their workplace \nanti-harassment policies and to understand how the EEOC makes enforcement \ndeterminations under Title VII and other analogous civil-rights laws by which they \nare bound. \n \n15 See Anti-Harassment Guidance, supra note 5. \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 14 of 23     PageID 776\n \nSmall businesses, like many of Amici’s members, value the Anti-Harassment \nGuidance.16 Our members often lack the resources to retain counsel for compliance \nassistance, sometimes lacking even Human Resources personnel to track and shift \npractices based on evolving employment law and related litigation risks given the \noverall landscape.17 Easy-to-understand guidance that recounts the rules of the \nroad and provides explanatory examples reduces the costs and burden on small \nbusinesses and helps employers comply with legal requirements. And, for a small \nbusiness, anything that reduces risk and increases stability and predictability \nmakes opening, survival, and growth more possible. Any decrease in costs can be \nbeneficial to a small business, where margins can be slim and incomes modest.  \nII.  The Anti-Harassment Guidance is good for businesses’ bottom lines \nand overall success and is supportive of a healthy economy. \nAlongside the harms to workers themselves,18 harassment in the workplace—\nspecifically harassment against LGBTQ+ workers—has enormous ramifications for \n \n16 Indeed, research by Amicus Small Business Majority shows that “an overwhelming \nmajority of small employers” value regulation as a means to even the playing field, \nand do not view it as a hindrance to business success.

Nearly half of LGBTQ+ workers \nreport that they have experienced mistreatment in the workplace based on their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. See, e.g., Brad Sears et al., Williams Inst., \nLGBT People’s Experiences of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment 5 (2021), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/34rzrya5. These experiences affect the nature and trajectory of \nLGBTQ+ workers’ participation in the workforce: LGBTQ+ employees have reported \nstaying in jobs for which they are overqualified, declining to seek promotions, quitting \n \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 15 of 23     PageID 777\n \nemployers, resulting in higher rates of turnover, people leaving the workforce, and, \nultimately, less diverse workplaces. Mitigating workplace harassment, including \nthrough reliance on guidance from the EEOC, attracts people from a range of \nbackgrounds into the workforce, improves employee performance, reduces turnover, \nand reduces the monetary and reputational costs of charges of discrimination and \nrelated litigation. Workforces that draw employees from a range of racial, gender, \nLGTBQ+, disability, and other backgrounds drive business success and bolster \neconomic growth. Amici and their members understand that the Anti-Harassment \nGuidance is not just a helpful tool to ensure their compliance with federal law; it’s \ngood for business.  \nThe business advantages of mitigating harassment and fostering diversity \nare many. Critically, employers’ ability to cultivate a workplace free of harassment \nand other forms of discrimination is crucial to bringing LGBTQ+ people into the \nworkplace and to reducing turnover. Workers are more willing to enter and stay in \nthe workforce when they do not fear discrimination and harassment at every corner. \nAnd surveys show that people want to work for employers who prioritize diversity \nand inclusion in the workplace—it is a “business-critical investment” for \nemployers.19 Moreover, the importance of reducing employee turnover and \n \njobs  in  response  to  harassment,  and  removing  themselves  from  the  workforce \naltogether. See id. \n19 Benevity Impact Labs, The State of Workplace DEI: How DEI Commitments \nImpact the Employee Experience 3 (2023), https://tinyurl.com/rpywhdrh (finding that \n“95% of employees now weigh a prospective employer’s DEI efforts when choosing \nbetween job offers with similar salary and benefits” and that “78% . . . would not \n \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 16 of 23     PageID 778\n \npromoting employee retention can scarcely be overstated. Businesses today—\nparticularly small businesses—are grappling with persistent worker shortages.20 \nIncentivizing worker retention is therefore a critical goal for all businesses. And \nwhen employers are able to retain their existing employees, it saves employers \nmoney on recruiting and training new employees.21 Amici believe that the Guidance \nwill serve that aim, promoting employee retention, reducing absenteeism, and \nsolidifying strong equity values in jobseekers pursuing healthy workplace \ncultures.22 \nFurther, as Amici know, workplaces free of harassment will not just foster \nemployee retention, but will lead to healthier, more productive, and better-\nperforming employees able to participate fully and freely in the workplace.23   \nAnd finally, having greater clarity around workplace civil-rights protections, \nincluding for LGBTQ+ workers, saves employers costs associated with employee \n \nconsider  working  for  a  company  that  fails  to  commit  significant  resources  to \nprioritizing DEI initiatives”). \n20  See  Ramsey  Sols.,  The  Small-Business  Labor  Crisis:  2023  Report  3  (2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5z2pau62 (noting that 11.3 million small-business owners report \nstruggling to find the employees they need); Giulia Carbonaro, America’s Labor \nShortage  is  Most  Severe  in  These  13  States,  Newsweek  (Aug.  10,  2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4fz773je. \n21 Shane McFeely & Ben Wigert, This Fixable Problem Costs U.S. Businesses $1 \nTrillion, Gallup.com (Mar. 13, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/4tr8zva2 (noting that “[t]he \ncost of replacing an individual employee can range from one-half to two times the \nemployee's annual salary”). \n22 Ahva Sadeghi, Building a Diverse, Equitable and Inclusive Culture for Gen-Z, \nForbes (Sept. 5, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/2deb69rh. \n23 See, e.g., Matt Krentz et al., Boston Consulting Grp., Inclusive Cultures Have \nHealthier and Happier Workers (Sept. 14, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/a465naaf; Brad \nSears et al., Williams Inst., LGBT People’s Experiences of Workplace Discrimination \nand Harassment, supra note 18, at 23-24.  \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 17 of 23     PageID 779\n \ncomplaints, enforcement actions, and litigation.24 Aside from incurring legal fees, \nemployers face reputational and publicity costs stemming allegations of \nharassment, which in turn may “driv[e] away customers, investors, and potential \ntalent.”25  As described above, the Anti-Harassment Guidance is a valuable resource \nto help employers make sense of legal developments over the last several decades \nand, in turn, fulfill their obligations under Title VII and related civil-rights laws to \nprevent and address harassment. The reduction of enforcement-related costs is all \nthe more important for many of Amici’s members, small businesses without \ndisposable resources to pour into legal and compliance tracking, and margins that \ncan ill-accommodate costly enforcement proceedings. \nUltimately, workplaces composed of employees from across a range of \nbackgrounds—made possible only by, among other things, employers’ ability to \nprotect their employees from workplace harassment—benefit from improved \ncollaboration, creativity, and innovation in the workplace and, in turn, promote \neconomic growth.26 Diversity in the workplace, meaning the inclusion of workers \nfrom a range of backgrounds and lived experiences, helps drive business success. \n \n24 Lacey Conner, The High Cost of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, Axcet HR \nSols.

Plaintiffs’  arguments  regarding  the  burdens  imposed by  the  Anti-\nHarassment Guidance are unfounded. \nPlaintiffs contend that the Anti-Harassment Guidance would burden \nemployers and create irreconcilable tension between federal and state law. They \nclaim that enforcing the mandates of Title VII as explained by the Guidance “makes \nthem responsible for determining and then monitoring the gender identities of their \nemployees.” Pls.’ Br. 27-28. They argue that the Guidance subjects employers to \nworkplace challenges and saddles them with the task of “review[ing] and revis[ing]” \ntheir compliance and training materials and workplace-harassment protocols.

Hence, employers around the country are already required to \ncomply with them. And insofar as Plaintiffs have state laws, or employment policies \nor guidance of their own, that are inconsistent with the Guidance’s explanation of \nthe contours of Title VII, those inconsistencies would not be remedied by enjoining \nthe Guidance. They will continue to exist because federal law through Title VII and \nthe body of case law pre- and post-dating Bostock interpreting Title VII continues to \nexist and govern the actions of these and other employers. \nIV.  Enjoining the Anti-Harassment Guidance would sow confusion among \nemployers. \nAllowing the Guidance to remain in effect will not burden employers; \nenjoining it stands to harm and confuse them, particularly small businesses like \nAmici’s members. As an initial matter, employers appreciate guidance that helps \nthem ensure that they are not running afoul of their legal obligations, including \ntheir obligations to prevent and address workplace harassment.33 \n \n33 See, e.g., Small Bus. Majority, Scientific Opinion Poll, supra note 16.  \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 21 of 23     PageID 783\n \n  Moreover, Plaintiffs push a confused, dual-track legal framework for \ninterpreting Title VII and the other relevant civil-rights statutes that treats the \nharassment of LGBTQ+ workers differently than members of other protected \nclasses. In the ordinary course, if a worker is protected against discrimination based \non a protected characteristic—whether race, color, religion, sex, national origin, \ndisability, age, or genetic information—it is also illegal under the civil-rights laws to \nharass them based on that protected characteristic. But under Plaintiffs’ \ninterpretation, the standard for what may constitute cognizable gender-identity or \nsexual-orientation harassment under Title VII does not mirror what constitutes \ncognizable discrimination under Title VII more broadly. Under Plaintiffs’ theory of \nTitle VII, for example, harassment on the basis of a person’s sexual orientation or \ngender identity, even when severe or pervasive, may be legal, while harassment tied \nto all of the other protections named in the law is not. That is not how civil-rights \nlaws work. \nSuch a carve-out is not just legally incorrect but also burdensome on the \ngood-faith efforts of employers, particularly small businesses, to comply with the \nrequirements of the federal employment civil-rights laws. And because, as described \nabove, the Anti-Harassment Guidance does not create new law or change existing \nlaw, enjoining the law would only leave employers like Amici’s members confused \nabout their legal obligations. Plaintiffs’ proffered interpretation of the civil-rights \nlaws only serves to sow confusion and add compliance costs, imposing an \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00173-Z     Document 47     Filed 11/26/24      Page 22 of 23     PageID 784\n \nunnecessary burden on employers, particularly small businesses that lack a range \nof employment-law experts at their command. \nEmployers desire and deserve the helpful information contained in the Anti-\nHarassment Guidance to help ensure that they are complying with federal civil-\nrights mandates, and workers likewise deserve the benefits of clearly articulated \nguidance regarding these protections. Accepting Plaintiffs’ arguments and enjoining \nthe Anti-Harassment Guidance would undermine both of these worthy interests.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Amici urge the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment and grant the Defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment. \n \nDated: November 20, 2024  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  s/ Sarah R.
