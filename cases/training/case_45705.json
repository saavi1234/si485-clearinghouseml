    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit brought by four states&mdash;Kansas, Alaska, Utah, and Wyoming&mdash;individuals, and nonprofit organizations challenging U.S. Department of Education regulations extending Title IX protections to prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender identity (the &ldquo;Final Rule&rdquo;). The plaintiffs, represented by the state Attorneys General, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and the Mountain States Legal Foundation, filed suit against the Department of Education and the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas on May 14, 2024. The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the Final Rule was contrary to Title IX, was in excess of statutory jurisdiction, was arbitrary and capricious, and violated separation of powers principles, the Spending Clause, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and attorneys' fees. District Judge John W. Broomes was assigned to the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Final Rule interpreted Title IX&rsquo;s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity and transgender status. In addition, the Final Rule stated that a school may be liable for discrimination under Title IX if it carried out any otherwise permissible distinction or separation based on sex in a manner that results in more than minimal harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs levied a number of statutory and constitutional claims against the Final Rule. They argued that the Final Rule was contrary to Title IX&rsquo;s text and history, which permitted schools to maintain sex-separate activities and athletics. The plaintiffs distinguished the Supreme Court's decision in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17313/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bostock v. Clayton County</a></em>, which held that Title VII&rsquo;s prohibition on sex discrimination protects employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The plaintiffs argued that the holding was limited to the facts and text and history of Title VII.</p>\r\n<p>Among other constitutional concerns, the complaint alleged that the Final Rule was an unconstitutional act of legislative power by an independent agency (in violation of the major questions doctrine), and chilled speech on the viewpoint that sex is immutable. In addition, the plaintiffs also asserted that the rule violated constitutional limits on the Spending Clause because it left States with no real power to decline enforcement, as the Final Rule was tied up with a significant amount of federal funding.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted a preliminary injunction on July 2, 2024, prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the Final Rule against the four plaintiff states and the schools attended by the members of the plaintiff organizations or their minor children. The court determined that the plaintiffs had adequately shown they were harmed, and were likely to prevail on the claims that the Final Rule conflicted with Title IX, was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the major questions doctrine, the Spending Clause, and the First Amendment. 739 F.Supp.3d 902.</p>\r\n<p>On July 10, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On July 19, 2024, the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to expand the injunction to cover any school where one of the organizational plaintiffs had a member was denied for lack of jurisdiction, due to the ongoing appeal. The court also denied the defendants' motion for a partial stay pending appeal, which sought to limit the scope of the injunction to cover only a specific part of the Final Rule, and to limit the schools to which the injunction applied. 2024 WL 3471331.</p>\r\n<p>On March 13, 2025, the Tenth Circuit granted the defendants' request to dismiss the appeal. Later that month, on March 21, the court ordered the parties to show cause why the case should not be dismissed as moot, as the new Trump Administration had declared it would enforce the old 2020 Title IX Rule rather than the rule challenged here. The defendants responded a few days later, on March 26, indicating that the case was not technically moot due to ongoing litigation in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/45612/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tennessee v. Cardona</a></em> but that it might soon become moot.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing as of April 19, 2025.</p>",

As of April 19, 2025, the case was ongoing, though the US had indicated it could soon become moot due to the Trump Administration's change in enforcement policy.",

      "text": "Case 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 1 of 10\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS \n \n   \nSTATE OF KANSAS et al.,   \n   \n  Plaintiffs,   \n   \nv.   \n  No. 24-4041-JWB \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF   \nEDUCATION et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR A PARTIAL STAY PENDING APPEAL \nDefendants respectfully request that this Court issue a partial stay pending appeal of its \nJuly 2, 2024, preliminary injunction, which enjoined Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule \nagainst the Plaintiff States, Plaintiff K.R.’s school, and the schools attended by the members (or \nchildren thereof) of the associational Plaintiffs.  See ECF No. 53 (Prelim. Inj.); ECF No. 54 (Mem. \nOp.).  The Court enjoined the Rule in full, even though Plaintiffs’ claims focused overwhelmingly \non the Rule’s treatment of gender identity discrimination, and this Court held that Plaintiffs were \nlikely to prevail in establishing that only one provision of the Rule—34 C.F.R. § 106.10—is \nactually unlawful.  See Mem. Op. 40 (finding that § 106.10 “is unlawful” without “explicitly \naddress[ing]” other provisions).  And even as to that provision, no Plaintiff asserts any harm \nstemming from the basic prohibition on denying students educational opportunities “simply for \nbeing . . . transgender.”  Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 651 (2020).   \nThe Court also enjoined the Rule with respect to all members of the associational Plaintiffs.  \nConsistent with bedrock principles of equity, the Defendants understand the Court’s injunction to \nextend no further than to schools attended by members (or children of members) who joined the \n1 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 2 of 10\norganizations prior to the suit being filed or, at a minimum, prior to the Court’s injunction.  The \nassociational Plaintiffs, however, are now treating the injunction as if it can extend to individuals \nwho were not even members of their organizations when this action was filed—indeed, they are \nactively using the injunction to recruit new members by representing that anyone who joins \nautomatically becomes a beneficiary of the injunction.   \nDefendants request that this Court stay the injunction insofar as it extends beyond the \nfollowing provisions of the 2024 Rule, from which Plaintiffs’ asserted harms stem: 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.31(a)(2), and the hostile environment harassment definition in 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 as applied \nto discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  And in light of the associational Plaintiffs’ \naggressive efforts to expand their ranks, Defendants further request that this Court stay the \ninjunction to the extent it applies to schools attended by members (or children of members) who \njoined the associational plaintiffs after the filing of this suit (or, at minimum, after entry of the \ninjunction). \nLEGAL STANDARD \nIn determining whether to grant a stay pending appeal, a court considers (1) likelihood of \nsuccess on appeal; (2) whether the applicant will suffer irreparable injury; (3) the balance of \nhardships to other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) the public interest.  Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  Each of these factors weighs in favor of a partial stay pending appeal. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants  Are  Likely  to  Succeed  in  Establishing  that  the  Injunction  Is \nOverbroad. \n \nThe injunction reaches provisions of the Rule that Plaintiffs did not challenge and that were \nnot held unlawful by the Court, as well as provisions that did not form the basis of any alleged \nirreparable injury underlying Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief.  Based on well-established \n2 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 3 of 10\nremedial principles and the Rule’s express severability provisions, Defendants are therefore likely \nto establish that the injunction is overbroad, and should be stayed to the extent it extends beyond \nthe following provisions of the 2024 Rule: (i) 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2), and (ii) the hostile \nenvironment harassment definition in 34 C.F.R. § 106.2, as applied to discrimination on the basis \nof gender identity.1  Defendants are also likely to establish that the injunction would be overbroad \nto the extent it applies to members of associational Plaintiffs who were not members of the Plaintiff \norganizations at the time the complaint was filed or, at a minimum, the injunction issued.   \nA.  The Injunction Is Overbroad Because It Reaches Provisions Not Challenged \nby Plaintiffs or Held Unlawful by the Court.  \n \nAs  Plaintiffs’  filings  make  clear,  their  principal  claims—and  the  purported  harms \nunderlying those claims—are grounded in objections to the Rule’s treatment of gender identity. \nSee Mem. In Supp. Of Pls.’ Mot for a Stay/Prelim Inj. 1 (PI Mot.), ECF No. 25 (complaining that \nthe Rule would “institutionalize gender ideology in every aspect of K-12 education”); PI Mot. at \n51 (complaining that “schools would have to reconfigure their bathrooms/locker rooms in order to \nfollow the Final Rule”).  And while Plaintiffs advanced a handful of other theories, see, e.g., PI \nMot. at 24-25 (contending that the Rule conflicts with 20 U.S.C. § 1688), the Court did not reach \nthem, holding only that § 106.10 “is unlawful” while declining to “explicitly address all of the \nprovisions in the Final Rule.”  Mem. Op. 40.  The Court also suggested that “DOE’s rulemaking \nwas arbitrary and capricious,” id., but its arbitrary-and-capricious analysis addressed only gender \nidentity issues.  See Mem. Op. 33-38. \n \n1 On appeal, Defendants will show that the entirety of the Court’s injunction cannot be \nsquared with Title IX’s plain text and Supreme Court precedent.  See Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. \nfor a Stay or Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 38.  In this stay motion, Defendants seek only narrower relief, \nasking that this Court stay the injunction to the extent it cannot be reconciled with long-established \nequitable principles governing the scope of preliminary relief. \n3 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 4 of 10\nThe Rule, however, promulgates many amendments to Title IX’s regulations entirely \nunrelated to gender identity.  These include, for example, provisions regarding the role of Title IX \ncoordinators, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474, 33,885 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(a)); \nfunding recipients’ notice of nondiscrimination and record-keeping obligations, id. at 33,885-86 \n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(c), (f)); access to lactation spaces, id. at 33,888 (to be codified \nat 34 C.F.R. § 106.40(b)(3)(v)); a recipient’s response to sex discrimination, id. at 33,888-91 (to \nbe codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.44); and grievance procedures for claims of sex discrimination, id. \nat 33,891-95 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.45, 106.46).  Plaintiffs did not challenge most of \nthese provisions in their requests for preliminary injunctive relief, nor did the Court find a single \none of them unlawful. The Court’s injunction was overbroad insofar as it reached these other \nportions of the Rule. \nThe Court’s suggestion that § 106.10 “permeates the entire rule,” such that “it is difficult \nto excise the remaining regulations without also eliminating those regulations that involve sex \ndiscrimination,” Mem. Op. 40, cannot be squared with the actual content of these unchallenged \nprovisions of the Rule, which have nothing to do with gender identity.  Nor does anything in the \nRule suggest that the Department’s decision to adopt those provisions turned on its conclusions \nabout  gender  identity  discrimination.    Quite  the  contrary:  as  the  Court  acknowledged,  the \nDepartment crafted a “severability clause . . . in each subsection in the current regulations which \nprovides: ‘If any provision of this subpart or its application to any person, act, or practice is held \ninvalid, the remainder of the subpart or the application of its provisions to any person, act, or \npractice shall not be affected thereby.’”  Id. (quoting 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.9, 106.18, 106.48).  The \nseverability determination resolves any doubt that the Department would have adopted the Rule’s \nprovisions addressing grievance procedures, lactation accommodations, and other issues not \n4 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 5 of 10\nrelated to gender identity on their own.  See Am. Fuel & Petrochemical Mfrs. v. EPA, 3 F.4th 373, \n384 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (explaining that severability of regulations “depends on the issuing agency’s \nintent,” and whether the “agency would have adopted the severed portion on its own” to “operate[] \nindependently”  (citations  omitted)),  cert.  denied  sub  nom.  Growth  Energy  v.  Am.  Fuel  & \nPetrochemical Mfrs., 142 S. Ct. 759 (2022); see also, e.g., Barr v. Am. Ass’n of Pol. Consultants, \nInc.,  591  U.S.  610,  624  (2020)  (“When  Congress  includes  an  express  severability  or \nnonseverability clause in the relevant statute, the judicial inquiry is straightforward.  At least absent \nextraordinary  circumstances,  the  Court  should  adhere  to  the  text  of  the  severability  or \nnonseverability clause.”).  Insofar as the Court found only that the Court’s treatment of gender \nidentity was unlawful, it erred in enjoining anything else. \nB.  Even as to Gender-Identity-Related Provisions, the Injunction Is Overbroad.  \nEven as to the gender identity issues upon which the Court focused, the injunction is \noverbroad.  Most notably, the injunction is overbroad in extending to § 106.10, rather than only \nthe definition of hostile environment harassment in § 106.2 as applied to gender identity and to \n§ 106.31(a)(2).  Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex,” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), and \n§ 106.10 sets out the scope of that general prohibition, explaining that “[d]iscrimination on the \nbasis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy \nor related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886.  Plaintiffs \nallege no harm from the Rule’s recognition that prohibited discrimination includes discrimination \non such bases  as sexual orientation; indeed, Plaintiffs nowhere suggest that they intend to engage \nin discrimination against students simply for being gay.  Plaintiffs thus offer no reason to enjoin \nthis and other aspects of § 106.10. \n5 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 6 of 10\nEven as to § 106.10’s inclusion of gender identity, Plaintiffs do not suggest that an \ninjunction  is  necessary  because  they  intend  to  treat  transgender  students  worse  for  being \ntransgender.  They do not, for instance, claim that they will be irreparably harmed if they cannot \nbar transgender students from participating in the science fair or student government simply for \nbeing transgender, quintessential forms of sex discrimination that the Department’s Title IX \nregulations would not expressly bar if § 106.10’s definition were to be enjoined.  Rather, Plaintiffs \nobject to the Rule’s provisions regarding gender identity as applied to sex-separate facilities like \nbathrooms and the use of pronouns when addressing transgender students.  See PI Mot. 30-42 \n(constitutional claim premised on pronoun usage and related gender identity issues); PI Mot. at 51 \n(suggesting that “schools would have to reconfigure their bathrooms/locker rooms in order to \nfollow the Final Rule”).  But § 106.10 is not the cause of Plaintiffs’ claimed harms in those \nrespects, which flow from the provisions of § 106.31(a)(2) regarding permissible sex-separation \nand § 106.2’s definition of hostile environment harassment.  \nSection 106.10, like Bostock, simply recognizes that discrimination on the basis of gender \nidentity is necessarily a form of prohibited sex discrimination, without “purport[ing] to address \nbathrooms, locker rooms,” 590 U.S. at 681, or other contexts in which different treatment or \nseparation on the basis of sex may be permitted under Title IX.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs offer no \nrationale that could support enjoining § 106.10, which the Department also specifically explained \nshould operate independently if other provisions of the Rule were invalidated.  See 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,848 (identifying § 106.10 in its severability discussion as an example of a provision “intended \nto operate independently” of other provisions in the Rule, and in particular noting that it is \n“distinct”  from  the  Rule’s  definition  of  “sex-based  harassment  .  .  .  and  the  prevention  of \nparticipation consistent with gender identity, which are addressed in §§ 106.2 and 106.31(a)”). \n6 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 7 of 10\nThe injunction is also overbroad insofar as it bars all applications of § 106.2’s definition \nof hostile environment harassment.  Plaintiffs object to the application of the 2024 Rule’s hostile \nenvironment harassment standard as applied to gender identity discrimination.  PI Mot. at 30-42.  \nBut § 106.2’s hostile environment standard applies beyond that limited context.  Indeed, it protects \nall students from “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884.  Plaintiffs did not \nidentify any way in which they face irreparable harm from § 106.2’s applications outside the \ncontext of discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  Thus, there is no basis for enjoining \nthose applications, which are not an asserted cause of Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries.   \nC.  The Injunction Would Be Overbroad If It Extended to Individual Members of \nAssociational Plaintiffs Who Joined After This Suit Was Filed.  \nSeparately, Defendants are likely to prevail in showing the injunction is overbroad if it \nextends beyond schools attended by members (or children of members) who were part of the \nassociational Plaintiffs at the time the suit was filed—or, at a minimum, at the time the Court \nentered the injunction.  As explained, Defendants understand the injunction to be so limited.  But \nthe associational Plaintiffs are treating the injunction as if it extends to individuals who were not \nmembers at the time the complaint was filed or even at the time this Court entered the injunction.  \nIndeed, in an apparent attempt to expand their ranks, the plaintiff Associations appear to be actively \nshopping the injunction to potential members ahead of the Court’s deadline to file a notice \nidentifying the schools covered by the decision.  See, e.g., @Moms4Liberty, X, (July 8, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SMH2-RLHP (inviting anyone to “[e]xempt your child’s school from the Biden \nAdministration’s radical rewrite of Title IX by becoming a member” of Moms for Liberty); \n@Moms4Liberty, X, (July 5, 2024), https://perma.cc/7JNE-XXLB (similar); @YAF, X, (July 4, \n2024), https://perma.cc/27ZM-23S2 (inviting the public to “Exempt Your School from the Biden \nAdministration’s Radical Rewrite of Title IX By Joining YAF!”); cf. Students for Fair Admissions, \n7 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 8 of 10\nInc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 201 (2023) (concluding that an \norganization had associational standing where it had “identified members and represent[ed] them \nin good faith”).   \nThe Plaintiff Associations’ treatment of the Court’s injunction contravenes longstanding \nequitable principles requiring that a party has one opportunity for relief and that the effect of any \njudgment should be bidirectional.  See Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \n367, 399 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring).  Plaintiffs would render the injunction a one-way \nratchet, allowing individuals to join the plaintiff Associations and enjoy the benefit of the Court’s \nruling after already knowing how the Court would rule.  Courts have long warned against the \ninequity of such “asymmetric” suits.  Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 397 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, \nC.J., concurring) (explaining the equitable and historical problems with “asymmetric” suits); see \nalso  Am. Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 547 (1974) (explaining that the rule against \none-way intervention under Rule 23 prevents potential parties from “await[ing] developments in \nthe trial or even final judgment on the merits in order to determine whether participation would be \nfavorable to their interests”).  At a minimum, then, the Court should stay the injunction to the \nextent it extends to  individuals who were not members of the plaintiff Associations when this \naction was filed—or, at a minimum, who were not members when the Court ordered preliminary \nrelief.   \nII.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor a Partial Stay.  \nThe remaining stay factors tilt decisively toward the Department.  Every time the federal \ngovernment “is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its \npeople, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) \n(Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (citation omitted).  The harm is particularly pronounced here because \n8 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 9 of 10\nthe Rule effectuates Title IX’s twin goals of “avoid[ing] the use of federal resources to support \ndiscriminatory practices [and] provid[ing] individual citizens effective protection against those \npractices.”  Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979).  Moreover, the overbroad injunction \ncould impair the rights of individuals with respect to the Rule’s provisions that are entirely \nunrelated to Plaintiffs’ claims by precluding the Department from taking steps to ensure that, inter \nalia, students who are new mothers have access to lactation spaces or that students are not being \npunished for being gay or transgender.  \nBy contrast, Plaintiffs suffer no harm from the Department’s limited request for a stay. As \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs plainly suffer no cognizable harm from the many provisions of the Rule \nthat they did not challenge or that the Court did not hold unlawful.  As to the limited provisions \nPlaintiffs have challenged, the allegations of harm underpinning Plaintiffs’ claims concerned only \nthe application of two discrete provisions—34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) and the definition of hostile \nenvironment harassment within 34 C.F.R. § 106.2—governing factual contexts in which recipients \nmay differentiate students based on sex, such as by providing sex-separated bathrooms and using \nsex-specific pronouns.  And Plaintiffs certainly suffer no harm from this Court ensuring that the \ninjunction’s scope is properly limited to those members of plaintiff Associations who were \nmembers at the time the action was filed or, at a minimum, at the time the Court issued its \ninjunction.  Accordingly, the harms that formed the basis for the Court’s issuance of preliminary \nrelief are not implicated here, and, in any event, do not outweigh the harm to the Department from \nan overbroad injunction.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should stay the preliminary injunction to the extent it extends beyond the \nfollowing provisions of the 2024 Rule: 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2), and the “hostile environment \n9 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 59   Filed 07/10/24   Page 10 of 10\nharassment” definition in 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 as applied to gender identity discrimination.  Further, \nDefendants request that the Court stay the injunction to the extent it applies to schools attended by \nmembers (or children of members) who joined the associational plaintiffs after the filing of this \nsuit (or, at minimum, after entry of the injunction). \n  Defendants respectfully request a ruling on this motion by noon on July 16; after that point, \nand absent relief from this Court, Defendants anticipate seeking relief from the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. \n  Defendants conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs regarding this request. Plaintiffs oppose a \nstay in all respects and intend to provide a response to the Court by close of business on Friday, \nJuly 12. \n \n Dated: July 10, 2024  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  BRIAN M.

Instead of focusing on the true mission of Title IX, which is to \nprotect women and girls from discrimination in education and to protect and promote women’s \nand girls’ sports, the Defendants attempt to rewrite it entirely to (1) institutionalize the left-wing \n \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 2 of 85\n \nfad of transgender ideology in our K-12 system and tie school funding to it, (2) mandate that \ncolleges and universities punish students who refuse to comply with these views through a \ncampus grievance process that is akin to “kangaroo courts,” and (3) require schools to provide \nbenefits to students and employees seeking voluntary abortions (even in states where it is \noutlawed) in direct conflict with Title IX’s abortion neutrality provision.  None of this has \nanything to do with Title IX.  This is not only wrong, it is unlawful because the Final Rule \n(1) violates the text of Title IX, the statute it claims to interpret, (2) attempts to unilaterally settle \nmatters subject to profound debate without clear authorization from Title IX or Congress, \n(3) violates the Constitution’s Spending Clause, and the First, Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and (4) is arbitrary and capricious.  \nThis unlawful rule also robs girls and women of their opportunity to participate in their \nschool’s education programs and activities, especially athletics, by forcing them to compete with \nbiological males.  It forces both boys and girls, in their most formative years, to sacrifice their \nprivacy in personal spaces such as restrooms, locker rooms, and even overnight \naccommodations.  Finally, it takes an explicit state function (the creation and administration of \npublic schools) and warps it by conditioning federal education funding on schools violating the \nconstitutional rights of their students and employees.  Rather than allow schools to fulfill their \neducational functions, it transforms them into ideological centers where only the Defendants’ \nviews are allowed to be heard.  Plaintiffs sue to prevent this from becoming reality. \nIn 1972, in response to serious concerns about discrimination against women and girls \nwith regard to educational opportunities, Congress passed, and President Nixon signed, Title IX \nof the Education Amendments of 1972.  Title IX specifically prohibits schools that receive \nfederal funding from discriminating on the basis of sex.  But the law and its regulations have \n \n  2 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 3 of 85\n \nalways recognized that providing students with sex-separated facilities, such as restrooms, locker \nrooms, and overnight sleeping accommodations, ensures the dignity and privacy for both boys \nand girls and is not “discrimination.”  Title IX guarantees that women and girls have equal \naccess to education programs and activities—especially athletic programs—and other school-\nrelated activities.  To that end, the law also permits schools to maintain sex-separate activities, \nincluding athletics, for students. \nCongress charged the Department of Education (“DoEd”) with promulgating regulations \nto ensure this access, opportunity, and privacy.  See, e.g., Education Amendments of 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93–380, § 844 (1974) (directing the Secretary of Education to promulgate rules “relating \nto the prohibition of sex discrimination . . . with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities”).  \nDoEd did so, promulgating regulations that include, for example, those that prohibit sex-based \ndiscrimination “in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a \nrecipient” of federal funding.  45 C.F.R. § 86.41.  This and other regulations have withstood \nscrutiny in the federal courts.  States, schools, parents, students, volunteers, women, and girls \nhave relied on the plain text of Title IX and on these regulations for decades. \nOn June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, \n590 U.S. 644 (2020).  In Bostock, the Court held that employers violate Title VII’s prohibition on \nsex discrimination by firing homosexual and transgender employees.  Id. at 682–83.  \nSpecifically, the Court held that an employer could not fire a biological male employee for \ncertain conduct while permitting a biological female employee to engage in the same conduct \nunrestricted.  Id. at 659.  Neither may an employer fire a biological male employee because he \ndid not sufficiently adhere to masculine stereotypes.  Id.  But Bostock did not hold that “sex” \nincludes “gender identity.”  Rather, the “Court [] explained that ‘sex’ refers to the biological \n \n  3 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 4 of 85\n \ndistinctions between males and females.”  Tennessee v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 615 F. \nSupp. 3d 807, 816 (E.D. Tenn. 2022).  Nor did Bostock equate transgender status, “gender \nidentity,” or homosexuality with “sex.”  In fact, the Court said, “homosexuality and transgender \nstatus are distinct concepts from sex,” Bostock, 590 U.S. at 669, and discrimination based on \nthose traits is not discrimination “because of sex” within the meaning of Title VII unless the \ndiscrimination is actually “on the basis of” the person’s biological sex.  In other words, it is \nemphatically not discrimination within the meaning of Title VII merely to recognize and take \naccount of sex.  Additionally, the Court specifically limited its holding to the facts of the case \nand the text and history of Title VII.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681. \nNotwithstanding the limited holding of Bostock, in 2021, President Biden ordered federal \nagencies to rewrite federal law and remove access and protections for women and girls as well as \nprivacy protections for all students to accommodate a new interest in “prevent[ing] and \ncombat[ing] discrimination on the basis of gender identity.”  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7023-25 (Jan. 20, 2021).  DoEd complied, publishing a Notice of Interpretation on June 22, \n2021 (“NOI”).1  To solidify the NOI, the DoEd is now attempting to rewrite Title IX to prohibit \nfederally funded schools from separating biological males and females in any educational \nprogram, including athletic programs based on the undefined concept of gender identity.  DoEd’s \nrewrite enshrines into federal regulations the elimination of the dignity and privacy protections \nfor boys and girls and the equal opportunity protections for girls by unilaterally proclaiming that \ntreating a person according to his or her biological sex rather than his or her “gender identity” \n                                                 \n1 This interpretation was enjoined on July 15, 2022 as to several states, including Kansas and \nAlaska, which are parties to this lawsuit.  Tennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 3:21-cv-00308 \n(E.D. Tenn.) (Order entering preliminary injunction filed on July 15, 2022), appeal pending in \nTennessee v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 22-5807 (6th Cir.) \n \n  4 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 5 of 85\n \nconstitutes “discrimination on the basis of sex” under Title IX.  This sleight of hand effectively \nreplaces the word “sex” in the statute with “gender identity.” And any treatment of a person \naccording to his or her biological sex, rather than his or her “gender identity” is presumed to \nconstitute more than de minimis harm.  Causing more than de minimis harm opens a school up to \ninvestigation by DoEd, which is an onerous process that consumes school resources, energy, and \ntime, and which separately could result in loss of federal funding.  In addition, it opens the \nschool up to a separate civil lawsuit under Title IX’s implied cause of action. \nThe new regulations are contrary to Title IX’s text and history.  They prohibit schools \nfrom maintaining sex-separate programs for males and females.  They prohibit schools from \nmaintaining sex-separate restrooms or locker rooms.  They open the door for biological males to \ncompete on female-only sports teams by prohibiting schools from making decisions based on \n“sex-stereotypes,” including “stereotypes” based on actual, physiological differences in athletic \nability.  And they remove dignity and privacy protections for boys and girls. \nAlong with the Department of Education, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) enforces \nTitle IX regulations.  Exec. Order No. 12,250, 28 C.F.R. part 41, app. A (1980).  The States of \nKansas, Alaska, Utah, and Wyoming (collectively, “the States” or “Plaintiff States”)—sue to \ndefend their interest in the continued receipt of federal education funds based on a reliance on \nbiological reality and Title IX, a reliance on the fact that biological males are different from \nbiological females and a reliance on the fact that Title IX was always explicit in its protection of \nbiological females in educational programs and activities, including sports.  The States sue to \nensure that women and girls can enjoy the benefits, opportunities, and other rewards from these \nprograms and activities that they are entitled to under the law.  The States also sue to prevent all \nstudents, parents, teachers, volunteers, and school staff from having their privacy invaded by \n \n  5 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 6 of 85\n \nhaving to share restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight accommodations with those of the \nopposite sex.  Finally, the States sue to ensure that they are not coerced by DoEd and DOJ into \nviolating the First Amendment rights of students, teachers, and other school employees who \ndisagree with the dictates of the Final Rule. \nPlaintiff K.R. has already suffered many of the harms the Final Rule will inflict. K.R. is a \n13-year-old female and student at an Oklahoma public school.  She has suffered the \nembarrassment and indignity of encountering males who identify as females in her school \nrestroom.  To avoid this harm and maintain her privacy, she stopped using the restroom at her \nschool entirely—until an Oklahoma law restored sex-designated restrooms in public schools.  \nAfter the Oklahoma law was enacted, she resumed using the restroom at school.  But the Final \nRule would override that law, requiring schools to admit males who identify as females into \ngirls’ locker rooms and restrooms, subjecting her once again to embarrassment and indignity \nwhen using the restrooms at school, and causing her to avoid those facilities altogether. \nK.R. also wants to continue exercising her right to speak freely.  She wishes to stay true \nto her religious beliefs and avoid using inaccurate pronouns that contradict someone’s sex.  And \nshe wants to express her views about gender identity at school, sharing with her friends that boys \ncannot become girls (or vice versa), that boys should not access the girls’ restrooms, and that \ngirls’ privacy from the opposite sex should be respected.  But the Final Rule threatens all these \nrights and protections, demanding that K.R.’s school punish her for her protected speech and \nreligious exercise.  89 Fed. Reg. 33,888 (“A recipient with knowledge of conduct that reasonably \nmay constitute sex discrimination in its education program or activity must respond promptly \nand effectively.”) (Final Rule, 34 C.F.R § 106.44(a)(1)).  K.R. challenges the Final Rule to \n \n  6 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 7 of 85\n \nensure that she and other girls maintain their rights to privacy, safety, free speech, and religious \nliberty. \nPlaintiff Moms for Liberty is a national organization with chapters across the country, \nwith members whose children attend schools that receive federal funding and are subject to Title \nIX regulations.  Moms for Liberty seeks to unify, educate, and empower parents to defend their \nparental rights at all levels of the government.  It is comprised of parents who seek to defend \ntheir fundamental right to raise their children in accordance with their values and beliefs, protect \ntheir children from indoctrination on social issues in schools, and protect their children from \nbeing forced to affirm ideas they do not believe in.  \nMembers of Moms for Liberty have deeply held beliefs on issues involving biological \nsex, gender identity, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics.  Included in these beliefs is that an \nindividual’s sex is determined at birth and that individuals should use restrooms and locker \nrooms matching their biological sex.  Moms for Liberty members and the children of Moms for \nLiberty members have engaged in speech advancing these values and wish to continue doing so.  \nAbsent the threat of discipline, their children, within the school setting, plan to continue using \npronouns consistent with a transgender individual’s biological sex and expressing their views on \nissues of gender identity and transgenderism, including that there are only two sexes.  If the Final \nRule is permitted to take effect, the speech of their members and of their members’ children will \nbe chilled and they will be compelled to affirm beliefs and views on sex, sex stereotypes, and \ngender identity that contradict their beliefs and values. \nPlaintiff Young America’s Foundation is a national organization devoted to promoting \ntraditional values and providing students on college campuses with resources to advance these \nvalues.  Young America’s Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with thousands of student \n \n  7 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 8 of 85\n \nmembers on college campuses across the country, including at Kansas State University, the \nUniversity of Wyoming, and the University of Utah.  Its mission is to ensure that young \nAmericans are inspired by the ideas of individual freedom, a strong national defense, free \nenterprise, and traditional values. \nMembers of Young America’s Foundation believe that sex is determined at birth by \nbiology, there are only two genders based on biological sex, and an individual cannot change his \nor her sex or gender.  Young America’s Foundation members frequently host speakers on college \ncampuses that discuss topics involving gender identity, transgenderism, and detransitioning.  If \nallowed to go into effect, the Final Rule will impede Young America’s Foundation’s \norganizational mission by chilling its members’ speech on topics regarding issues involving \ngender identity and transgenderism and will deter its college chapters from hosting speakers who \ndiscuss topics regarding gender identity, transgenderism, and detransitioning.  Furthermore, its \nmembers will be compelled to affirm individuals’ so-called gender identity, contrary to their \nbeliefs and values. \nDoEd’s new rules also affect female athletes, like members of Plaintiff Female Athletes \nUnited (“FAU”).  FAU is a nonprofit organization created to protect women’s sports, to support \nfairness and equal opportunity for female athletes, and to ensure that women and girls are not \nforced to compete against biological males who identify as female.  Many FAU members are \nfemale athletes who currently compete on girls’ sports teams at schools governed by Title IX.  \nAnd some of these members live in Plaintiff States—including Kansas, Wyoming, and Utah—\nthat have passed laws or regulations designating women’s sports as being open to biological \nwomen only.  Because of these state protections, some of these FAU members have not had to \ncompete against male athletes and have benefited enormously from fairness in sports and equal \n \n  8 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 9 of 85\n \nathletic opportunity.  But the Final Rule threatens to override these laws, taking away the right of \nFAU members to equal athletic opportunity and subjecting them to future competitions against \nmales with natural physiological advantages.  The Final Rule strips these women of their chance \nto be champions and to compete on a level playing field in their own sports. It also threatens to \ndeny them the very collegiate scholarship opportunities that Title IX created. \nThese FAU members also want to protect privacy and safety in school restrooms, locker \nrooms, overnight team trips, and showers.  Yet the Final Rule would force these female students \nto use restrooms, to change in locker rooms, to sleep in hotel rooms, and to share showers with \nbiological males who “identify” as females.  In pursuing that goal, the Final Rule purports to \npreempt state laws (like Utah’s) that protect women’s privacy in intimate spaces like locker \nrooms.  In this way, the Final Rule exposes these women to embarrassment and humiliation, \nplacing individuals’ subjective feelings over the objective biological differences between the \nsexes.  Likewise, some FAU members wish to advocate at school in favor of women’s sports and \nwomen’s privacy and to use pronouns consistent with others’ sex.  They wish to express the view \nthat males who identify as female are in fact males and that these males should not access \nwomen’s-only spaces.  But the Final Rule punishes and chills this protected speech by branding \nit harassment.  FAU and its members seek to stop the Final Rule so that its members and other \nwomen can continue to benefit from Title IX’s promise made—equal opportunity in education. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this case concerns whether the DoEd acted in compliance with the United States \nConstitution and federal law, including Title IX and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n2.  This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to the judicial review provisions of the \nAPA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06, and 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (empowering district courts to “compel an \n \n  9 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 10 of 85\n \nofficer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the \nplaintiff”). \n3.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(1) because: Plaintiff State \nof Kansas resides in this judicial district and real property is not involved in this action. \n4.  There is a present and actual controversy between the parties. \n5.  Plaintiffs are challenging a final agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(13), \nand 704. \n6.  This Court may grant Plaintiffs the relief they request under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 705-06, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \n7.  Plaintiffs request that a jury trial, if any, will be held in the Topeka Division of the \nDistrict of Kansas. \nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n8.  Plaintiff State of Kansas is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n9.  Kansas sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests, \nincluding its interests in protecting its citizens, schools, and interest in federal education funds. \n10.  Kansas law mandates that schools “separate overnight accommodations [] for \nstudents of each biological sex during school district sponsored travel that requires overnight \nstays by students.”  Kan. Stat. Ann. 72-6286(a) (Supp. 2023). \n11.  Kansas law also mandates sex-separation in sports in its public schools and state-\nsanctioned athletic programs.  Kan. Stat. Ann. 60-5603 (Supp. 2023). \n \n  10 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 11 of 85\n \n12.  Finally, Kansas protects its citizens’ free speech and religious liberty rights both \nin its constitution and by statute.  See Kan. Const. Bill of Rts. §§ 7, 11; Kan. Stat. Ann. 60-5301–\n22. \n13.  Kansas brings this suit through its attorney general Kris W. Kobach.  He is the \nchief legal officer of the State of Kansas and has the authority to represent Kansas in federal \ncourt.  Kan. Stat. Ann. 75-702(a). \n14.  Plaintiff State of Alaska is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n15.  Alaska sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests, \nincluding its interests in protecting its citizens, schools, and interest in federal education funds. \n16.  Alaska law mandates equal opportunity for “both sexes” in athletics and in \nrecreation in a manner that is commensurate with the general interested of the members of “each \nsex.”  It further mandates that schools provide showers, toilets, and training-room facilities “for \nboth sexes.”  AS 14.18.040. \n17.  Alaska protects its citizens’ free speech and religious liberty in its state \nconstitution.  Alaska Const. art. I, §§ 4, 5. \n18.  Alaska brings this suit through its attorney general Treg R. Taylor.  He is the legal \nadvisor to the governor and other state officers and has the authority to represent Alaska in all \ncivil actions in which the state is a party.  AS 44.23.020(a), (b)(3). \n19.  Plaintiff State of Utah is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n20.  Utah sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary interests, \nincluding its interests in protecting its citizens, schools, and interest in federal education funds. \n \n  11 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 12 of 85\n \n21.  Utah law generally provides that male students may not compete on school \nathletic teams that are “designated for students of the female sex in an interscholastic athletic \nactivity.”  Utah Code Ann. § 53G-6-902. \n22.  Finally, Utah protects its citizens’ free speech and religious liberty rights both in \nits state constitution and by statute.  See Utah Const. art. I, §§ 1, 4, 15; Utah Code Ann. § 53G-1-\n203; see also S.B. 150 (Utah 2024) (passed both houses of legislature, awaiting governor’s \nsignature). \n23.  Sean D. Reyes is the Attorney General of Utah.  He is authorized by Utah law to \nsue on Utah’s behalf. \n24.  Plaintiff State of Wyoming is a sovereign State of the United States of America. \n25.  Wyoming sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and proprietary \ninterests, including its interest in protecting its citizens, schools, and interest in federal education \nfunds. \n26.  Wyoming law provides that “[a] public school or a private school that competes \nagainst a public school shall expressly designate school athletic activities and teams as one (1) of \nthe following based on sex: (i) Designated for students of the male sex; (ii) Designated for \nstudents of the female sex; or (iii) Coed or mixed.”  Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 21-25-102(a). \n27.  Wyoming law also provides that “[a] student of the male sex shall not compete, \nand a public school shall not allow a student of the male sex to compete, in an athletic activity or \nteam designated for students of the female sex.”  Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 21-25-102(b).  \n28.  “‘Sex’ means the biological, physical condition of being male or female, \ndetermined by an individual’s genetics and anatomy at birth.”  Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 22-25-\n101(a)(iv). \n \n  12 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 13 of 85\n \n29.  Wyoming also protects its citizens’ free speech and religious liberty rights in its \nstate constitution. \n30.  Wyoming brings this suit through its attorney general Bridget Hill.  She is the \nchief legal officer of the State of Wyoming and has the authority to represent Wyoming in \nfederal court.  Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 9-1-603(a).  \n31.  Plaintiff K.R. is a 13-year-old female and resident of Stillwater, Oklahoma in \nPayne County.  K.R. attends Stillwater Middle School, a public school in Oklahoma for 6th and \n7th graders.  Stillwater Middle School is a recipient of Title IX funding. \n32.  In the past, K.R. encountered males who identify as females in the girls’ restroom \nat her school.  These encounters made K.R. feel intensely uncomfortable, embarrassed, and \nunsafe using the restroom at school.  Those restrooms at her school provide minimal privacy \nprotections because the stalls have large cracks between the door and the wall panels. \n33.  If K.R. entered the women’s restroom and a male was in the restroom, she would \nturn around and leave.  She eventually decided to stop using the school restrooms altogether to \navoid the loss of privacy and feelings of embarrassment.  So, from around 7:00 a.m. when she \nleft home to around 4:00 p.m. when she returned home, K.R. frequently would not use the \nrestroom at school at all.  This was extremely uncomfortable for K.R.  \n34.  K.R. feels intensely uncomfortable using the bathroom with males regardless of \nwhether they personally identify as male or female. \n35.  For a time, K.R. did not even tell her parents about not using the restrooms at \nschool because her school made the situation feel normal and she felt that she could not object.  \n \n  13 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 14 of 85\n \n36.  Eventually, Oklahoma passed a state law requiring every multiple occupancy \nrestroom in K-12 public schools to be designated by sex and accessible only to members of that \nsex.  See Okla. Stat. 70, § 1-125. \n37.  Since that law was passed, K.R. has returned to using the female restrooms at her \nschool, and she feels safe doing so because of the state law. \n38.  K.R. is also a Christian.  She believes that all people should be treated with \ndignity and respect, that God created every person male or female, and that people should accept \ntheir God-given sex and not seek to reject or change it.  K.R. believes it would be a lie and a \nviolation of her faith for her to falsely affirm that someone is a member of the opposite sex.  For \nexample, it would violate K.R.’s religious beliefs to use inaccurate pronouns of someone else—\nmeaning pronouns that do not accurately reflect the person’s sex. \n39.  K.R. knows some of her classmates want K.R. to refer to them by pronouns that \nindicate they are the opposite sex, but K.R. has refused to do so because that would violate her \nreligious beliefs.  Some of K.R.’s classmates have been offended by K.R.’s decision to avoid \nusing inaccurate pronouns. \n40.  K.R. has also discussed with her friends at school that having male students in the \ngirls’ restroom makes her extremely uncomfortable and anxious.  And she has talked to friends at \nschool about her religious beliefs that there are only two sexes and that people cannot change \ntheir sex. \n41.  K.R. desires to keep using the restroom without members of the opposite sex \npresent.  She also wants to continue to share her beliefs and not be forced to speak in ways that \nviolate her faith. For example, she wants to continue to share with her friends at school that she \nbelieves there are only two sexes and that people cannot change their sex.  And she doesn’t want \n \n  14 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 15 of 85\n \nto be forced to refer to people in a way that violates her religious beliefs by using inaccurate \npronouns.  She also wants to express her discomfort and disagreement with males using the girls’ \nrestrooms. \n42.  Moms for Liberty is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization with chapters in forty-\neight states and over 130,000 nationwide.  Moms for Liberty is dedicated to organizing, unifying, \neducating, and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of \ngovernment.  The core principles of Moms for Liberty include defending the fundamental right \nof parents to raise their children in accordance with their values and morals and protecting \nchildren from political and social indoctrination by schools.  Moms for Liberty engages in efforts \nto assure that schools maintain policies that respect these principles. \n43.  Young America’s Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with \napproximately 140 chapters on college campuses across the country.  Young America’s \nFoundation’s mission is to ensure that young Americans are inspired by the ideas of individual \nfreedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values.  Consistent with its \nmission, Young America’s Foundation provides college students with access to educational \nresources, campus flyers and tabling materials, and speakers. \n44.  Plaintiff Female Athletes United (“FAU”) is an Internal Revenue Code Section \n501(c)(3) membership organization formed for the purpose of defending women and girls’ \nsports, ensuring that women and girls have equal opportunities, and guaranteeing that women \ncompete on a fair and safe playing field. Simply put, FAU promotes girls’ and women’s right not \nto compete against biological males who identify as females on girls’ and women’s sports teams. \n45.  FAU is a coalition of current and former female athletes and anyone, whether \nmale or female, who wants to ensure women’s sports remain a place for only women. \n \n  15 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 16 of 85\n \n46.  FAU has members in states across the county and at least five members located in \nthe Plaintiff States.  These members participate on their girls’ and women’s sports teams at \nschools governed by Title IX.  These members compete on their women’s teams at their schools \nand benefit from competing against only women and girls in athletic competitions.  And many of \nthese members attend schools with classmates who identify as transgender or non-binary. \n47.  A.B.S. is a 17-year-old female, FAU member, and resident of Topeka, Kansas.  \nShe attended and will soon graduate from Washburn Rural High School where she competed on \nthe girls’ powerlifting, volleyball, wrestling, softball, and track and field teams.  Washburn Rural \nHigh School is a public school and recipient of Title IX funding. \n48.  A.B.S. has a scholarship to play volleyball at MidAmerica Nazarene University in \nOlathe, Kansas next year.  MidAmerica participates in the National Association of Intercollegiate \nAthletics, which has a policy that protects female athletes by allowing only biological female \nathletes onto women’s and girls’ sports teams. \n49.  During her senior year, A.B.S. was invited to compete with the top 24 male and \nfemale javelin throwers in all of Kansas.  She broke a school record for the javelin throw that had \nbeen in place for 10 years. \n50.  A.R.S. is a 13-year-old, FAU member, and resident of Topeka, Kansas.  She \nattends Washburn Rural Middle School where she competes on the girls’ volleyball team.  \nWashburn Rural Middle School is a public school and recipient of Title IX funding. \n51.  A.R.S. is a seventh-grade student and plans to compete in volleyball next year at \nRossville Middle School.  She plans to play softball at Rossville High School, and she hopes to \nplay softball in college. \n \n  16 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 17 of 85\n \n52.  A.R.S. grew up in a sports family and watched her sister, A.B.S., earn a \nscholarship to play volleyball in college.  She started playing softball when she was four and has \nplayed travel softball most of her life.  A.R.S. currently plays softball on a city club team and \nplans to continue until she can play softball in high school.  She hopes to continue playing in \ncollege.  \n53.  T.P. is a 15-year-old, FAU member, and resident of Park County, Wyoming.  She \nattends Powell High School where she competes on the junior varsity girls’ tennis team.  Powell \nHigh is a public school and recipient of Title IX funding. \n54.  T.P. is a freshman and plans to play on her school tennis team throughout high \nschool.  She expects to join the varsity team in the coming years. \n55.  Elizabeth Zwahlen is an 18-year-old, FAU member, and resident of Summit \nCounty, Utah.  She attends Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, where she just completed her \njunior year and competes on the girls’ track and cross-country teams.  Utah Valley University is \na public university and recipient of Title IX funding. \n56.  Zwahlen grew up in a family of runners.  Her dad competed in collegiate track, \nher mom ran in high school, and her grandmother has finished multiple marathons.  Zwahlen has \ncompeted on school track and cross-country teams since high school.  She currently competes in \nthe 800 meter and 1500 meter and sometimes in the 5K or 10K. \n57.  Zwahlen has a full athletic scholarship and has competed every season since she \nstarted college. \n58.  T.Z. is a 17-year-old , FAU member, and resident of Summit County, Utah.  She \nattends North Summit High School where she competes on the girls’ cross country and track \nteams.  North Summit High School is a public school and recipient of Title IX funding. \n \n  17 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 18 of 85\n \n59.  T.Z. is a high-school junior and plans to continue competing in cross country and \ntrack for the remainder of her time at North Summit. \n60.  T.Z. grew up in a family that loved sports. Her father and sister both competed in \ncollegiate-level track. T.Z. runs the 3200, 1600, and 800 meter on her high-school track team. \n61.  Each of these FAU members identified above uses the women’s restrooms and \nchanges in the women’s locker rooms at their schools.  Some of them shower in the women’s \nlocker rooms, and some go on overnight trips with their schools. \n62.  For example, T.Z.’s school team participates in multiple meets throughout the \nyear that require the team to stay overnight.  For these competitions, the students on the team \nwill share a room and often a bed with their teammates. \n63.  Zwahlen’s track and cross-country teams at Utah Valley go on numerous \novernight trips to attend meets.  On these trips, she shares a room and sometimes a bed with her \nteammates. \n64.  None of the FAU members identified above would feel comfortable using the \nwomen’s restrooms at their schools with a male or using the girls’ locker room with a male, or \nshowering with a male nearby, or sharing the same hotel room or bed with a male during an \novernight trip.  Doing any of this would make these members feel embarrassed, humiliated, \nunsafe, exposed, and vulnerable.  The intimate spaces at their schools do not have sufficient \nprivacy protections for them to feel comfortable sharing these spaces with a male. \n65.  For example, Zwahlen changes and showers in the locker room area at her school.  \nShe does not want to do that in the presence of a male or with a male nearby. \n \n  18 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 19 of 85\n \n66.  T.Z. also regularly changes in the school locker room for practice and when \ngetting ready for track and cross country meets, and she does not want to do that in the presence \nof males. \n67.  None of the FAU members identified above wants to compete against biological \nmales in their school sports, regardless of how those male competitors personally identity \nthemselves.  These members think that competing against males in their sports would be unfair \nand would deter and discourage them from pursuing sports and from enjoying the value of \nparticipating in competitive sports.  Some of the members identified above also fear being \ninjured if they have to compete against males who are typically bigger, faster, and stronger. \n68.  Some of the FAU members identified above want to advocate in favor of fairness \nin women’s sports at their schools to their friends and coaches, express their belief that there are \nonly two sexes, and express their belief that biological males who identify as females are in fact \nmales and should not be allowed to compete on women’s sports teams.  As part of this advocacy \nand to affirm the view that people cannot change their sex, some of the FAU members refuse to \nuse inaccurate pronouns that contradict someone’s sex. \n69.  For example, A.B.S. and T.P. want to advocate for fairness in women’s sports at \nschool and want to share their discomfort with competing against or sharing intimate spaces with \nmales who identify as females.  In addition, T.P. wants to express at school the view that there \nare only two sexes.  T.P. had a teacher request that she refer to a classmate inaccurately as \n“they/them,” and T.P declined to use those inaccurate pronouns because they did not reflect the \nclassmate’s sex.  T.P. believes she will likely have classmates in the future who request to be \naddressed with inaccurate pronouns like this because some students at her school identify as \ntransgender or non-binary. \n \n  19 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 20 of 85\n \n70.  T.Z. has also spoken with her friends at school about her belief that only females \nshould compete in girls’ sports, that there are only two sexes, and that people cannot change their \nsex.  She wants to have similar conversations and express her beliefs in the future even though \nshe knows other people may disagree with her. \n71.  Many FAU members identified above compete in sports in states with laws that \nensure only biological women and girls can join women’s sports teams.  Because of these \nprotections, these FAU members have not been forced to compete with or against male athletes. \n72.  T.Z. also competes in a state with a law that requires restrooms, locker rooms, \nshowers, and changing rooms in public schools to be designated by sex except in limited \ncircumstances.  Because of these protections, she has not yet encountered a male attempting to \nutilize these spaces.  She feels safe knowing she can utilize these areas without a male present. \n73.  Zwahlen competes in a state with a law that requires locker rooms and attached \nshowers and restrooms in government-owned buildings to be designated by sex in most \ncircumstances.  Because of these protections, she has not yet encountered a male attempting to \nutilize these spaces.  She feels safe knowing she can utilize these areas without a male present. \n74.  The FAU members identified above felt relieved and safe when their respective \nstates passed laws protecting women’s sports.  These FAU members fear that without their \nstates’ laws ensuring fairness in women’s sports teams, they will have to compete against males \nwho identify as female and lose possible scholarship opportunities to these males. \nB.  Defendants \n75.  The DoEd is an executive agency of the federal government responsible for \nenforcement and administration of Title IX. 20 U.S.C. §§ 3411, 3441. \n \n  20 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 21 of 85\n \n76.  Defendant Miguel Cardona is the United States Secretary of Education and is \nresponsible for the operation of DoEd.  20 U.S.C. § 3411.  He is sued in his official capacity.  \n77.  Defendant DOJ is an executive agency of the United States.  DOJ has the \nauthority to enforce Title IX.  Exec. Order No. 12,250, 28 C.F.R. part 41, app. A (1980). \n78.  Defendant Merrick B. Garland is the Attorney General of the United States and is \nresponsible for the operation of the DOJ.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n79.  The fundamental declaration of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is \nthat “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n80.  Title IX frequently refers to “sex” and recognizes a biological male-female \ndichotomy.  See, e.g., id. § 1681(a)(7) and (8). \n81.  Title IX never refers to “gender identity” (or any similar or related concept).  See \nid. § 1681. \n82.  Members of Congress, recognizing that Title IX currently refers to “sex” and not \n“gender identity,” have introduced legislation to change the law so that it includes protections for \n“gender identity” on more than one occasion.  See, e.g., Fairness for All Act, H.R. 1440, 117th \nCongress (2021).  All of these attempts have failed. \n83.  Congress has recognized that Title IX allows schools to recognize and consider \nsex in numerous situations. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(6) and (7) (exempting fraternities, \nsororities, YMCAs, YWCAs, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, American Legion conferences \nrelated to Boys State conferences and Boys Nation conferences, among other examples). \n \n  21 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 22 of 85\n \n84.  Separately, DoEd promulgates regulations to fulfill the promise of Title IX.  Its \nprogram and activities regulation largely tracks the fundamental declaration: \n[N]o person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  academic, \nextracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or \nactivity operated by a recipient which receives Federal financial assistance. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (2023). \n \n85.  The prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex is not a prohibition on \nclassification or separation on the basis of sex.  To the contrary, DoEd permits educational \ninstitutions to provide separate housing for males and females, provided that the  \n[h]ousing provided by a recipient to students of one sex, when compared to that \nprovided to students of the other sex, shall be as a whole: (i) Proportionate in \nquantity to the number of students of that sex applying for such housing; and \n(ii) Comparable in quality and cost to the student. \n \nId. § 106.32(a)–(b); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1686. \n86.  DoEd also permits federal financial assistance recipients to “provide separate \ntoilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for \nstudents of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.”  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n87.  DoEd’s athletics regulation is similar: \n[N]o person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe  benefits  of,  be  treated  differently  from  another  person  or  otherwise  be \ndiscriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural \nathletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics \nseparately on such basis. \n \nId. § 106.41(a). \n88.  DoEd’s athletics regulation also allows a federal financial assistance recipient to \nseparate the sexes in the context of athletics under certain circumstances: \n \n  22 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 23 of 85\n \nNotwithstanding the requirements of [34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a)], a recipient may \noperate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such \nteams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.  \nHowever, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for \nmembers of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other \nsex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been \nlimited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try-out for the team \noffered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.  For the purposes of this part, \ncontact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and \nother sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact. \n \nId. § 106.41(b).  \n89.  Thus, Title IX authorizes sex-separate sports as long as men and women have \nequal opportunities. \n90.  Overall, DoEd’s regulations repeated references to “sex” recognize a male-female \ndichotomy.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b) (referring to “one sex” and “the other sex”). \n91.  DoEd did not promulgate formal regulations requiring schools to adopt grievance \nprocedures for students who had been subject to discrimination (which includes hostile \nenvironment harassment), whether from an employee of the institution or a fellow student until \nMay of 2020.  See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities \nReceiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, 2020) (the “2020 \nAmendments”). \n92.  Before this, schools could, and often did, base their internal grievance procedures \non DoEd’s 2001 Guidance and separately on a 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2016 Dear \nColleague Letter.  None of these guidance documents were formal regulations and none have the \nforce of law.  U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., Off. for Civil Rts., Sexual Harassment Guidance: \nHarassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties,62 FR 12034 \n(Mar. 13, 1997), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/sexhar01.html#skipnav2; U.S. \nDep’t. of Educ., Off. for Civil Rts., Revised Guidance on Sexual Harassment: Harassment of \n \n  23 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 24 of 85\n \nStudents by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties (Jan. 19, 2001), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.pdf.; U.S. Dep’t. of Educ, Off. for Civil \nRts., Dear Colleague Letter: Sexual Violence (April 4, 2011), https://www2.ed.gov/about/\noffices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf, withdrawn by, U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., Off. for Civil \nRts., Dear Colleague Letter (Sept. 22, 2017), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/\ncolleague-title-ix-201709.pdf; U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., Off. for Civil Rts, Dear Colleague Letter: \nSexual Violence (2014), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf, \nwithdrawn by, U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., Off. for Civil Rts., Dear Colleague Letter (2017), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-title-ix-201709.pdf. \n93.  Among other things, the 2020 Amendments require schools to “[e]stablish \nprocedural due process protections that must be incorporated into a recipient’s grievance process \nto ensure a fair and factual determination on when a recipient investigates and adjudicates a \nformal complaint of sexual harassment.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 30,030. \n94.  The 2020 Amendments require, among other things, (a) notice to the accused; \n(b) an opportunity for the accused to examine and respond to evidence; (c) an opportunity for \nboth the accused and accuser to “present expert witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory \nevidence”; (d) a live hearing with cross-examination of witnesses at colleges and postsecondary \ninstitutions; (e) a neutral decision maker who was not the Title IX coordinator.”  85 Fed. Reg. at \n30,054.  These procedures are intended to effectuate due process for the accused. \n95.  The 2020 Amendments also codify the Gebser / Davis framework for determining \nwhat constitutes sexual harassment.  85 Fed. Reg. at 30,033 (citing Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. \nSch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998) & Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., \n \n  24 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 25 of 85\n \n526 U.S. 629 (1999)).  DoEd adopted “verbatim” the definition of “sexual harassment” from \nDavis.  85 Fed. Reg. at 30,030. \n96.  “Sexual harassment” is currently defined by reference to three standards: (1) quid \npro quo harassment; (2) sexual violence offenses; and, most prominently, (3) as “conduct that is \nso severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to \neducation.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 30,030, 30,036; 34 C.F.R. § 106.30 (definitions). \n97.  This definition applies to administrative enforcement, when federal funding is put \nat risk, 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,033, and to enforcement in court proceedings. \n98.  Congress also passed a special provision related to abortion.  The provision is \noften called a neutrality clause.  20 U.S.C. § 1688.   \n99.  Unlike any other form of disability, illness, pregnancy, or related condition or \nmedical procedure, Congress has specifically clarified that “Nothing in this chapter shall be \nconstrued to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any \nbenefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.  Nothing in this section \nshall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or individual because such \nperson or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion.”  \nId. \n100.  Schools may, therefore, provide benefits related to an abortion (if otherwise \nconsistent with law), but DoEd cannot condition the receipt of federal funds on the provision of \nany such benefit.  \n101.  Additionally, by including these provisions in a statue prohibiting sex \ndiscrimination, Congress has recognized that pregnancy is inherently tied to biological sex. \n \n  25 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 26 of 85\n \nB.  The Proposed Rule \n102.  On July 12, 2022, DoEd published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled \n“Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal \nFinancial Assistance” (the “Proposed Rule”).  The Proposed Rule was published in the Federal \nRegister at 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390–579. \n103.  The Proposed Rule supposedly “clarified” DoEd’s opinion that “sex \ndiscrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  87 Fed. Reg. 41,391. \n104.  Further, the Proposed Rule prohibited “sex-based harassment,” which DoEd \nasserted included a “broader range of sexual misconduct than that covered under the definition of \n‘sexual harassment’ in the current regulations.”  Id. at 41,413.  \n105.  DoED did, however, correctly recognize that its proposed definition was “more \nsimilar to the definition of ‘hostile environment’ under Title VII than the definition of ‘sexual \nharassment’ under the current Title IX regulations.”  Id. at 41,415. \nC.  Comment on the Proposed Rule \n106.  DoEd opened the Proposed Rule for public comment to address the scope of the \nregulation and on whether additional regulations would be required. \n107.  The Proposed Rule invited comment on the scope of the regulation and on \nwhether additional regulations would be required. \n108.  Plaintiff State of Kansas along with other states timely submitted multiple \ncomment letters on the Proposed Rule via the federal rulemaking portal.  True and correct copies \nof those comments are attached hereto as Exhibits 2–3. \n \n  26 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 27 of 85\n \n109.  The comments explained in detail why DoEd should re-adopt the position it took \nin an enforcement matter on August 31, 2020 that when a school provides separate teams for \nmembers of each sex under 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), the school should separate those teams on the \nbasis of biological sex, not on the basis of gender identity.  See generally Exs. 2 & 3.2 \n110.  FAU’s and K.R.’s counsel—Alliance Defending Freedom—submitted numerous \ncomment letters addressing how the Rule violates rights to individual privacy and dignity, \njeopardizes fairness in women’s sports, and burdens free speech and religious liberty.  True and \ncorrect copies of these comments are attached.  See Exs. 4–6. \n111.  As these comments discuss, students suffer harm when forced to allow members \nof the opposite sex into their intimate spaces like restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight \naccommodations.  They explain that having sex-designated intimate spaces protects individuals \nfrom exposing their bodies to members of the opposite sex and from being exposed to members \nof the opposite sex.  The need for privacy and the harm from non-consensual exposure is \nparticularly acute for female students. \n112.  These comments also address the Proposed Rule’s adverse effect on women’s \nathletics and highlight the scientific basis for designating sports by sex and the physiological \nadvantages that males, including males who identify as female, have over female athletes. \n113.  Southeastern Legal Foundation’s comment letters asserted that the proposed \nchanges to Title IX “would chip away at parents’ rights, making the government their children’s \nultimate caregiver.”  Ex. 7, at 2.  The comment letters went on to contend that the changes \n                                                 \n2 DoED’s 49-page comprehensive analysis of the Title IX problems with biological males competing in female \nathletics, issued on August 31, 2020, is available here: \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/01194025-a2.pdf It was withdrawn, however, \nby the Biden Administration, on February 23, 2021, see \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/01194025-a5.pdf \n \n  27 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 28 of 85\n \n“would do away with student’s freedom of expression” while “impos[ing] a nationwide \northodoxy on all parents, students, and teachers in any school receiving federal funds.”  Id.  The \ncomment letters further contended that the rule would “chill” speech for fear of being charged \nwith harassment and being disciplined for making comments on issues such as gender identity, \nsex stereotypes, and sex characteristics.  Id. at 4−5. \n114.  Mountain States Legal Foundation submitted a comment in opposition to the \nproposed changes to Title IX.  A true and correct copy of that comment is attached hereto as \nExhibit 8.  MSLF’s comment letter explained how the then-proposed regulatory changes to the \nimplementation of Title IX would trigger a cascade of negative effects for schools, including \ndamaging due process rights, impairing the right to free speech, and destabilizing what is \ncurrently a settled Title IX regime that will have been in place for nearly 4 years.  Id. at 1 (“[T]he \nproposed regulations would confuse stakeholders, cause unneeded expenses for schools and \nstudents, and create regulatory whiplash as the regulations are either struck down or rescinded \nsoon after their enactment.”).  Most especially, MSLF addressed the severe consequences that \nwould result if schools had a duty to suppress “misgendering” or compel students and teachers to \nuse “preferred pronouns.”  Id. at 17-18 (describing a host of neo-pronouns that are laid out by \ncolleges such as “xemself” and “per”).  Similarly, MSLF is concerned with compelling the use of \nneo-honorifics for teachers and administrators (spoken by students and parents) such as “Mx.” \ninstead of Mr. or Ms. \nD.  The Final Rule \n115.  Despite extensive criticism in the public comments, the Final Rule nevertheless \namends 34 C.F.R. § 106 in numerous identical ways to those that the Proposed Rule previously \ninitially proposed.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,474.  The Final Rule purports to “provide greater clarity \n \n  28 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 29 of 85\n \nregarding: the definition of ‘sex-based harassment’; the scope of sex discrimination, including \nrecipients’ obligations not to discriminate based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, \npregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity; and recipients’ \nobligations to provide an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex.”  \nId. at 33,476. \n116.  On April 29, 2024, DoEd issued a final administrative rule titled \n“Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal   \nFinancial Assistance” (the “Final Rule”).  The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register \nat 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474–778.  A true and correct copy of the Final Rule is attached hereto as \nExhibit 1. \n117.  As is relevant here, this part of the Final Rule makes three major changes, none of \nwhich are authorized by Title IX: (1) it essentially changes the definition of “sex” to include \n“gender identity”; (2) it changes the standard for what constitutes sexual harassment; and (3) it \nchanges the person to whom a school may be liable for discrimination. \n118.  First, the Final Rule “interprets” Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination on the \nbasis of sex to include discrimination on the basis of “gender identity.”  Id. at 33,477. \n119.  The DoEd considers “gender identity” to mean “an individual’s sense of their \ngender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned at birth” and finds it \notherwise “unnecessary to articulate a specific definition of ‘gender identity.’”  Id. at 33,809. \n120.  The Final Rule recognizes there is a difference between sex and “gender identity.” \n121.  The Final Rule assumes that there are more than two “gender identities.”  See id. \nat 33,804–05 (removing references to “both sexes”). \n \n  29 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 30 of 85\n \n122.  DoEd included an unexhaustive list of categories that could be considered when \ndetermining whether discrimination is “sex-based”: “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, \nquestioning, asexual, intersex, nonbinary, or describe their sex characteristics, sexual orientation, \nor gender identity in another similar way.”  Id. at 33,803.  None of these terms are specifically \ndefined.  Id.  Even sexual orientation disorders are fairly included within the broad language of \nthe April 29 rule. \n123.  Additionally, the Final Rule relies on the World Professional Association for \nTransgender Health, Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse \nPeople, Version 8, 23 Int’l J. Transgender Health S1 (2022), which recognizes dozens of “gender \nidentities” including “eunuch,” “nonbinary,” “transgender,” “gender nonconforming,” “gender \nqueer or diverse,” “gender diverse,” “third gender lying beyond the gender binary,” “two spirit,” \nand many others that are not widely recognized in the United States.  The Final Rule does not \naccount for, provide guidance concerning, or limit liability with respect to, any “gender identity” \noutside the “gender binary.” \n124.  The Final Rule would require educational institutions to take a person at their \nword as to their “gender identity” without documentation or questioning.  Id. at 33,819. \n125.  The Final Rule provides no guidance for ascertaining a person’s “gender identity” \nif the information is not volunteered.  In fact, “requiring a student to submit to invasive medical \ninquiries or burdensome documentation requirements to participate in a recipient’s education \nprogram or activity consistent with their gender identity imposes more than de minimis harm.”  \nId. at 33,819 (emphasis added).  The Final Rule considers requesting a birth certificate to be a \n“burdensome documentation requirement.”  Id. \n \n  30 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 31 of 85\n \n126.  The Final Rule acknowledges that “gender identity” may not be known or readily \nknowable.  Id. at 33,809.  Nevertheless, the Final Rule states “a recipient must not treat \nindividuals more or less favorably based on their gender identity” and “may not prevent a person \nfrom participating in its education program or activity consistent with the person’s gender \nidentity,” id., which, again, may not be known or readily knowable.  Thus, an educational \ninstitution may “discriminate” against a student—risking federal funding and civil liability—\nwithout even knowing it is discriminating, especially considering that the Final Rule assumes \nthere are multiple “gender identities.” \n127.  Currently, a school is not liable for discrimination under Title IX unless the \nschool has actual notice of the discrimination.  Forth v. Laramie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 85 F.4th \n1044, 1053 (10th Cir. 2023).  Under the Final Rule, a school could be liable for “discrimination” \nif it knows it has male-only and female-only restrooms (and knows males cannot use the female \nrestroom and vice versa) even if it does not know if any student, applicant, visiting student, \nparent, teacher, staff member, or other visitor has a “gender identity” that does not match his or \nher biological sex. \n128.  Second, the Final Rule states that it “clarifies” that a school may be liable for \n“discrimination” if it “carr[ies] out any otherwise permissible different treatment or separation on \nthe basis of sex in a way that would cause more than de minimis harm, including by adopting a \npolicy or engaging in a practice that prevents a person from participating in an education \nprogram or activity consistent with their gender identity.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,818 (emphasis \nadded). \n129.  This would be a change from the courts’ current interpretation of \n“discrimination,” which requires a showing of “unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person \n \n  31 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 32 of 85\n \nwould determine is ‘so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive’ that it effectively denies a \nperson equal access to education.”  85 Fed. Reg. 30,065.  This definition currently applies to \nboth civil liability and administrative enforcement.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 (defining “Hostile \nenvironment harassment”). \n130.  The Final Rule acknowledges that, even if the standards for administrative \nenforcement can be or are different than those used for civil liability, that “does not mean [] that \nadministratively imposed remedial actions can never have financial consequences.”  Id. at 33,474 \nn.10. \n131.  Third, the Final Rule “clarifies” the definition of “person” to whom the school \nmay be liable for discrimination.  It now “clarifies” that “person” as any student, employee, or \nany other person who “was participating or attempting to participate in the recipient’s education \nprogram or activity at the time of the alleged sex discrimination.”  Id. at 33,846. \n132.  Schools may be liable for “discriminating” against students, parents of students, \napplicants for admission, parents of applicants, parent chaperones, visiting students, parents of \nvisiting students, teachers, employees, coaches, visiting coaches, independent contractors, guests \nof the school, and others.  Id. \n133.  The Final Rule declines to define “specific conduct and practices that constitute \n. . . gender identity discrimination,” id. at 33,808, but does provide some instances in which a \nschool would likely be found to be discriminating if it treats a person according to his or her sex \nrather than “gender identity.”  These instances reveal how broad and vague these conduct or \npractices could be. \n \n  32 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 33 of 85\n \n134.  For example, the Final Rule acknowledges that students have a “legitimate \ninterest” in “safety and privacy” of sex-separate facilities (such as restrooms, locker rooms, and \novernight accommodations).  Id. at 33,820. \n135.  However, it goes on to state these “concerns” are “unsubstantiated and \ngeneralized.”  Id. at 33,820.  Further, “students experience sex-based harm that violates Title IX \nwhen a recipient bars them from accessing sex-separate facilities [including restrooms, locker \nrooms, and overnight accommodations] or activities consistent with their gender identity.”  Id. at \n33,818.  Any “such harm cannot be justified or otherwise rendered nondiscriminatory merely by \npointing to the fact that, in general, there are physical differences between the sexes.”  Id. at 33, \n819. \n136.  The Final Rule repeatedly refers to prior “Dear Colleague” Letters, including the \n2016 Dear Colleague Letter, where DoEd advised recipients that they must treat a transgender \nfemale-identifying student the same as a biological female student for the purposes of \naccommodations on overnight school trips.  2016 Dear Colleague Letter at 4.3 \n137.  Thus, if it is allowed to go into effect, the Final Rule would require that schools \npermit biological males (including students, visiting students, applicants, their parents, teachers, \nstaff, contractors, visitors, and others) to access female-only facilities (including restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and overnight accommodations) without question (and vice versa), or else the \nschool risks losing its federal funding. \n138.  As another example, the Final Rule would make clear that schools can no longer \nseparate students based on biological sex for “classes or portions of classes.”  Id. at 33,819.  This \nwould include gym class and health and sexual education classes. \n                                                 \n3 https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf \n \n  33 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 34 of 85\n \n139.  As another example, while the Final Rule claims to maintain First Amendment \nprotections, id. at 33,803 (suggesting nothing in the Final Rule requires an educational institution \nto violate free speech rights), DoEd has already taken the position that educational institutions \nare at risk of losing federal funding (and at risk of civil liability) if a teacher does not use a \nstudent’s “preferred pronouns” for any reason, including if the teacher did not know that the \nstudent’s “gender identity” differed from his or her biological sex or if the teacher had a free \nspeech or religious liberty objection.  See 2016 Dear Colleague Letter at 3.  The Final Rule \nwould likely also apply to completely innocuous speech such as the statement that “there are \nonly two genders.” \n140.  As evidence of this, the Final Rule would lower the standard for harassment to \ninclude “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is \nsubjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a \nperson’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,884 (emphasis added). \n141.  This position would chill students’ and teachers’ speech.  Female students who \nraise concerns about having to share a locker room with a male athlete or a restroom with a male \nvisiting parent are at risk of facing investigation and disciplinary proceedings for “hostile \nenvironment harassment” because their words could be seen as offensive and severe or pervasive \nand no longer need to meet the current “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive standard” in \norder to amount to harassment. \n142.  Similarly, the Final Rule is so vague and broad that students would self-censor for \nfear that their speech on topics such as gender identity, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics \ncould fall within its new definitions and standards. \n \n  34 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 35 of 85\n \n143.  The Final Rule would also compel speech from teachers, school employees, \nparents, and students, in that it would require students to use an individual’s “preferred \npronouns” and names of choice, forcing students to affirm gender identity and transgender \nideology contrary to their personal beliefs and values.  \n144.  The Final Rule would also compel speech from students and parents, in that it \nwould require students and parents to use teachers’ and school staffs’ honorifics that do not \nmatch their sex, or use “neo-honorifics” such as “Mx.”  \n145.  The Final Rule ostensibly would maintain “current regulations on athletics,” \nwhich do allow female-only and male-only sport teams.  Id. at 33,817. \n146.  However, the Final Rule would also apply to all “discrimination” (as the Final \nRule now defines it) “except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the \ncorresponding regulations at [34 C.F.R.] §§ 106.12 through 106.15, 20 U.S.C. 1686 and its \ncorresponding regulation [34 C.F.R.] § 106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b).”  Id. at 33,817.  The Final \nRule would not except 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a), which prohibits discrimination “in any \ninterscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient,” and says “no \nrecipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.” \n147.  Defendants have already taken the position that “the Title IX regulation \npermitting schools to separate certain athletic teams by sex does not authorize categorical bans \non transgender girls’ participation in girls’ sports.”  Brief of Amicus United States of America, \nB.P.J. v. West Virginia, 98 F.4th 542 (4th Cir. 2024) at 21; cf. U.S. Dept. of Justice and DoED \n2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students at 3.   \n148.  In fact, according to Defendants, any “categorical ban” on biological males’ \nparticipation in female-only sports “is inconsistent with Title IX’s overarching goal of ensuring \n \n  35 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 36 of 85\n \nequal opportunity.”  Brief of Amicus United States of America, B.P.J., 98 F.4th 542, at 12.  They \nhave said that “prohibiting [biological males] from participating on girls’ sports teams because \ntheir sex assigned at birth was male” causes “harm” and constitutes discrimination on the basis \nof sex.  Id. \n149.  The Final Rule’s assertion that a separate regulation will address athletics is a red \nherring because, “[DoEd] has indicated that it would consider in a forthcoming notice of \nproposed rulemaking (NPRM) what criteria, if any, recipients should be permitted to use to \nestablish students' eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletic team.”  Id. at \n29.  (emphasis added). \n150.  Therefore, DoEd’s default position is that no separation based on athletics is \npermitted on the basis of sex but further guidance may provide some criteria for limited \nexceptions to that general rule.  The lack of separate guidance identifying such exceptions \nnaturally means that there are no exceptions based on the Final Rule. \n151.  The Final Rule also says that DoEd considers it a violation of Title IX when a \nschool engages in “impermissible” “sex-stereotyping” by making decisions “based on \n‘paternalism and stereotypical assumptions about women’s interests and abilities,’ and a \n‘remarkably outdated view of women and athletics.’”  Id. at 33,811 (quoting Pederson v. La. \nState Univ., 213 F.3d at 858, 880 (5th Cir. 2000)). \n152.  The Final Rule does not explain why sports are exempted if the relative difference \nin boys’ and girls’ athletic abilities is only a “sex-stereotype” which cannot be relied on to \nseparate students based on biological sex. \n \n  36 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 37 of 85\n \n153.  Defendants would likely use the Final Rule to prohibit blanket bans on biological \nmales competing on and against female-only athletics teams, requiring schools to allow men to \nplay on women’s teams. \n154.  The Final Rule does not provide any guidance as to how schools are to decide \nwhich men must be permitted to play on women’s teams or how to avoid “sex-stereotyping” in \nthis area. \n155.  The Final Rule does not provide any guidance as to whether female athletes are \npermitted to withdraw or otherwise decline to compete against male athletes if they reasonably \nfear bodily injury, or if such conduct would constitute discrimination. \n156.  The Final Rule does not provide any guidance to schools as to how to maintain \ncompetitive fairness for female athletes when other schools field male athletes with an obvious \ncompetitive advantage.  (Such as a male 18-year old male Senior in High School who abruptly \nbegins to identify as female). \n157.  The Final Rule does not provide any guidance to schools as to how to classify \n“gender-fluid” or “two-spirited” athletes who wish to compete on both male and female teams. \n158.  The Final Rule does not provide any guidance to schools as to how to classify, for \nathletics purposes, “non-binary” students who decline to participate as either male or female, \nbecause they insist that they fall into neither category. \n159.  Like the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule notes only in passing DoEd’s prior \ncontrary position.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,804.  \n160.  The Final Rule acknowledges that DoEd is currently enjoined from enforcing this \ninterpretation against twenty states, including Plaintiff States Kansas and Alaska, but simply says \n \n  37 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 38 of 85\n \nthat DoEd “disagrees” with the Court’s reasoning in that case.  Id. at 33,804, citing Tennessee v. \nU.S. Dep't of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d 807, 842 (E.D. Tenn. 2022). \n161.  While the Final Rule does acknowledge that DoEd cannot interfere with a \nperson’s religious liberty rights or rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of \n1993,  PL 103–141, November 16, 1993, 107 Stat 1488, it does not provide any exemption for \nreligious students, teachers, staff, administrators, coaches, etc., and instead says DoEd “will \ninvestigate” all complaints and make individual determinations when a person cannot comply \nwith the Final Rule due to his or her religious belief.  Id. at 33,809. \n162.  These changes (and the constitutional concerns they raise) implicate the Spending \nClause contract that the States made with the federal government when they accepted federal \nfunding in exchange for providing equal opportunities for women and girls and for ensuring \nprivacy protections for all students.   \n163.  The Final Rule fails to adequately address comments made by Plaintiff States \nregarding the Spending Clause and their contract with the federal government.  See id. at 33,516–\n17. \n164.  Instead, the Final Rule suggests “Federal agencies have authority to define the \ncontours of the Spending Clause contract with recipients through their regulations.”  See id. at \n33,517. \n165.  The Final Rule clashes with other parts of Title IX as well.  The Final Rule \nrequires that educational institutions “treat pregnancy or related conditions as any other \ntemporary medical conditions for all job-related purposes, including commencement, duration \nand extensions of leave; payment of disability income; accrual of seniority and any other benefit \nor service; and reinstatement; and under any fringe benefit offered to employees by virtue of \n \n  38 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 39 of 85\n \nemployment.”  Id. at 33,796  \n166.  The Final Rule defines “pregnancy or related conditions” to mean pregnancy, \nchildbirth, termination of pregnancy.”  Termination of pregnancy includes voluntary abortion.  \nId. at 33,575. \n167.  Employees must also be allowed a leave of absence to obtain an abortion, even \nwhen the educational institution does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, as well as “in \nthe case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave \nunder such a policy.”  Id. at 33,798. \n168.  The Final Rule also requires educational institutions to provide a woman who has \nhad or who is recovering from an abortion access to all education programs and activities which \ncould include access to online or homebound instruction during recovery from an abortion, \nproviding a student additional time to complete an exam or coursework if a student travels out of \nstate for the abortion.  Id. at 33, 777. \n169.  The Final Rule requires educational institutions to offer women obtaining \nabortions “Reasonable Modifications” of policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal \naccess (i.e. to facilitate their abortions), including “intermittent absences to attend medical \nappointments; access to online or homebound education; changes in schedule or course \nsequence; extensions of time for coursework and rescheduling of tests and examinations.”  Id. \n170.  Women obtaining abortions must also be allowed a voluntary leave of absence, \nalong with reinstatement “to the academic status and, as practicable, to the extracurricular status \nthat the student held when the voluntary leave began.”  Id. \n171.  Students obtaining an abortion must be treated “in the same manner and under the \nsame policies as any other temporary medical conditions with respect to any medical or hospital \n \n  39 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 40 of 85\n \nbenefit, service, plan, or policy the recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with \nrespect to students admitted to the recipient’s education program or activity.  Id. \n172.  “Fringe benefit offered to employees by virtue of employment,” leave—especially \nmandatory provision of leave when leave is not available under existing policies or when the \nemployee has no accrued leave time available, “payment of disability income,” “accrual of \nseniority,” “benefit[s] of service,” “access to online or homebound instruction,” and “extra time \nto complete exams” are all benefits provided by the educational institutions. \n173.  Thus, the Final Rule requires educational institutions to provide leave, disability, \nand other benefits in connection with abortions in direct conflict with Title IX’s neutrality clause. \n174.  In addition to rewriting Title IX to change the definition of “sex” and to requiring \nschools to provide benefits for abortion, the Final Rule changes current regulations in \nproblematic ways.   \n175.  The Final Rule eliminates many of the grievance procedure due process \nprotections that were put in place by the 2020 Amendments.  See id. at 33,876–77.   \n176.  Prior to the 2020 Amendments, schools across the country had implemented \ngrievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints in conformance with the procedural \nrecommendations contained in DoEd’s 2011 Dear Colleague Letter.   \n177.  Often, these procedures violated the due process rights of accused students and \nemployees.  “As of August 16, 2019, no fewer than 298 of the post-Dear Colleague letter \nlawsuits (191 in federal court) have yielded substantive decisions, at various stages of the legal \nprocess… Of the 298 decisions in state and federal court, colleges have been on the losing side in \n151.”  Samantha Harris & KC Johnson, Campus Courts in Court: The Rise in Judicial \n \n  40 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 41 of 85\n \nInvolvement in Campus Sexual Misconduct Adjudications, 22 N.Y.U. J. LEGIS. & PUB. POL’Y 49, \n65-66 (2019).   \n178.  As of 2024, more than five hundred state and federal lawsuits are estimated to \nhave been filed challenging procedural due process deficiencies in Title IX grievance \nprocedures.4  See Norris v. Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, 362 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1020 (D. Colo. \n2019) (“The Tenth Circuit has not so opined, but several district courts have found that a lack of \nmeaningful cross-examination may contribute to a violation of due process rights of an accused \nstudent in a disciplinary hearing regarding sexual assault.”); Doe v. Baum, 903 F.3d 575, 581 \n(6th Cir. 2018) [denying motion to dismiss] (“our circuit has made two things clear: (1) if a \nstudent is accused of misconduct, the university must hold some sort of hearing before imposing \na sanction as serious as expulsion or suspension, and (2) when the university's determination \nturns on the credibility of the accuser, the accused, or witnesses, that hearing must include an \nopportunity for cross-examination”). \n179.  The Final Rule would largely revert to the grievance process that was in effect \nprior to the 2020 Amendments.  Section 106.45 & .46 (involving students at post-secondary \ninstitutions), pg. 1540, 1550.  \n180.  Rather than an opportunity to examine the evidence, the accused is given access \nto an “an equal opportunity to access either the relevant and not otherwise impermissible, or the \nsame written investigative report that accurately summarizes the evidence ” (106.46(c)(1)(iii), \n106.46(e)(6)); rather than an opportunity to question and cross-examine witnesses, “[a] recipient \nmust provide a process that enables the decisionmaker to question parties and witnesses” \n106.45(g); the accused may be denied an attorney (“the postsecondary institution may establish \n                                                 \n4 https://www.chronicle.com/article/were-making-the-same-title-ix-mistakes-again. \n \n  41 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 42 of 85\n \nrestrictions regarding the extent to which the advisor may participate in the grievance \nprocedures, as long as the restrictions apply equally to the parties”) (106.46(e)(2)); no live \nhearing is required (106.46(e)(6)(2),106.46(g)); and the decisionmaker in any grievance may be \nthe same person as the investigator (106.45(b)(2)). \n181.  The Final Rule extends beyond the United States.  Id. at 33,853. see contra 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681(a) (“No person in the United States shall …”) (emphasis added). \nE. “Gender Identity” \n182.  “Gender identity” is not a statutorily cognizable identity category. \n183.  “Gender identity” is subjective. See Doe ex rel. Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., \n897 F.3d 518, 522 (3d Cir. 2018). \n184.  The sole criterion used to determine “gender identity” apparently is whether one \nsays one is transgender.  See, e.g., Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 F.3d 694, 722 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(Williams, S.J., concurring); B.P.J., 2023 WL 111875, at *8; cf. Cal. Health & Safety Code \n§ 103426; Wash. Admin. Code § 246-490-075. \n185.  Unlike biological sex, “gender identity” is not a static or an immutable \ncharacteristic “determined solely by accident of birth.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd., 57 \nF.4th 791, 807 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc).  And the Final Rule would require schools to take \npeople at their word as to their “gender identity.” \n186.  There is also “the issue of gender fluidity in which students may switch between \ngenders with which they identify.”  Id. at 798. \n187.  Lastly, “gender identity” is not limited to a male/female dichotomy.  Depending \non whom you ask, gender identity covers people who identify with any of the following gender \nidentities: “boygirl,” “girlboy,” “genderqueer,” “eunuch,” “bigender,” “pangender,” \n \n  42 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 43 of 85\n \n“androgyne,” “genderless,” “gender neutral,” “neutrosis,” “agender,” “genderfluid,” “third \ngender,” and others.  See generally World Professional Association for Transgender Health, \nStandards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8, 23 Int’l \nJ. Transgender Health S1 (2022).5 \n188.  Indeed, a third of the respondents to the 2015 National Transgender \nDiscrimination Survey (a survey in which all respondents “identif[ied] as transgender”) reported \ntheir “primary gender identity” as either “part time as one gender, part time as another” or some \ngender other than male or female.  Jamie M. Grant et al., Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the \nNational Transgender Discrimination Survey 16 (2015).  Each and every time a student’s \n“gender identity” changes, the school is once again at risk of discriminating by treating the \nstudent according to his or her biological sex (or according to his or her former “gender \nidentity”), regardless of whether the school is aware of the change. \nF. The Rule Irreparably Harms Plaintiffs \n189.  The Final Rule would irreparably harm Plaintiffs. \n190.  Plaintiff States operate education programs and activities that are subject to Title \nIX’s requirements. \n191.  The Kansas Legislature has created or authorized educational institutions such as \nK–12 public school districts, schools for the blind and deaf, and state universities that \ncollectively received around $1.5 billion in federal financial assistance for fiscal year 2022 and \nare projected to receive around $1.6 billion in federal financial assistance during fiscal year \n2023.

On information and belief, \nthese numbers have not been substantially diminished for FY2024. \n192.  Plaintiff State of Alaska operates educational programs and activities that are \nsubject to Title IX’s requirements. \n193.  The Alaska Legislature has established and maintained a system of public schools \nopen to all children of the State, such as K-12 public schools, the state board school, and other \nspecial schools. It has further established the state university.  In fiscal year 2022, the federal \ngovernment provided $237 million for K-12 schools and $198 million for the University of \nAlaska, not including Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds.  In fiscal year \n2023, the federal government provided $225 million for K-12 school and $177 million for the \nUniversity of Alaska, again not including ESSER funds.  On information and belief, these \nnumbers have not been substantially diminished for FY2024. \n194.  The State of Utah has created or authorized educational institutions such as K–12 \npublic school districts, schools for the blind and deaf, and state universities that receive federal \nfinancial assistance.  For FY 2025, federal funding is projected to account for approximately \n8 percent of Utah’s total base public education revenue of $7.7 billion.  See LEGIS.

Plaintiff State of Wyoming operates educational programs and activities that are \nsubject to Title IX’s requirements. \n196.  The Wyoming Legislature has established and maintained a system of public \nschools open to all children of the State, such as K-12 public schools. It has further established \n \n  44 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 45 of 85\n \nthe state university.  In fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 the federal government provided \nmillions of dollars in federal financial assistance for K-12 schools and the University of \nWyoming. On information and belief, the federal government will provide millions of dollars in \nfederal financial assistance for K-12 schools and the University of Wyoming for fiscal year \n2025. \n197.  The Final Rule says that DoEd’s Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) would address \ncomplaints of sex discrimination and discrimination based on “gender identity,” consistent with \nOCR’s jurisdiction under Title IX and the final regulations, even in religious institutions.  89 \nFed. Reg. 33, 837; id. at 33,847–848. \n198.  The Final Rule also states that “OCR [will] evaluate and, if appropriate, \ninvestigate and resolve consistent with these regulations’ requirement that a recipient not \ndiscriminate against parties based on sex,” including gender identity.  Id.  \n199.  Plaintiff State of Kansas has enacted and maintains laws or policies relating to \neducational institutions that conflict with the Final Rule, as discussed supra. \n200.  Other laws and state policies do not apply solely to educational institutions but \nnonetheless conflict with the Final Rule insofar as they apply to educational situations in certain \nsituations.  For example, the state’s Women’s Bill of Rights defines the terms “sex,” “female,” \n“male,” “woman,” “girl,” “man,” “boy,” “mother,” and “father” strictly in connection with \nbiology and requires school districts, as well as other state and local entities that collect vital \nstatistics for certain purposes, to identify each individual person in the collected data set as either \nmale or female at birth.  K.S.A. 77-207. \n201.  Kansas and the federal Constitution protect citizens’ right to religious liberty and \nfreedom of expression, which includes protecting those who recognize that there are only two \n \n  45 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 46 of 85\n \nsexes and who refuse to use a person’s “preferred pronouns.”  See Green v. Miss U.S.A., LLC, 52 \nF.4th 773, 783 (9th Cir. 2022); Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 511 (6th Cir. 2021). \n202.  Other Plaintiff States have also enacted and maintain laws (or policies) that also \nconflict with the Final Rule.  See AS 14.18.040; Utah Code Ann. § 53G-6-902; Utah Code Ann. \n§ 63G-31-301(1); Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 21-25-101, et al. \n203.  Private parties have relied on prior DoEd action to challenge similar laws enacted \nand maintained by other states.  Private parties would almost certainly rely on the Final Rule to \nchallenge Plaintiff State’s laws regarding sex and clubs and organizations (including athletics), \nlocker rooms, restrooms, and overnight travel. \n204.  There therefore is a credible threat that private parties would seek to have the \nDoEd and DOJ enforce, and that DoEd and DOJ would enforce, the Final Rule against Plaintiffs. \n205.  Therefore, there is also a credible threat that DoEd and DOJ would enforce the \nFinal Rule against Plaintiff States. \n206.  Completed enforcement of the Final Rule could cost Plaintiff States significant \nfederal financial assistance, since the laws of several states prohibit compliance with portions of \nthe Rule. \n207.  Plaintiff States adopted their laws and policies, and established sex-separated \nrestrooms, locker rooms, showers, residence halls, and other living facilities, in reliance on their \nunderstanding that Title IX does not prohibit such laws, policies, or practices.  This \nunderstanding was based on longstanding DoEd regulations and prior guidance, including initial \npost-Bostock guidance from DoEd and DOJ. \n208.  The Final Rule undermines Plaintiff States’ reliance interests and create \nregulatory uncertainty for Plaintiffs and other regulated entities. \n \n  46 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 47 of 85\n \n209.  The Final Rule interferes with Plaintiff States’ sovereign right to “create and \nenforce” their own laws.  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. \n592, 601 (1982); see also Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986) (“[A] State clearly has a \nlegitimate interest in the continued enforceability of its own statutes.”); Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. \n3d at 821 (“States suffer a cognizable injury for purposes of constitutional standing when they \nallege an intrusion on their ability to enforce their own legal code, whether by way of direct \ninterference or interference analogous to substantial pressure to change state laws.”). \n210.  The Final Rule imposes administrative costs and burdens on Plaintiff States and \nother regulated entities because it forces them to offer training regarding the effect of students’ \nand staffs’ “gender identities.” \n211.  Indeed, the Final Rule estimates that compliance would cost an additional $3,090-\n$8,986 per year per school.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,850. \n212.  The Final Rule would also require Plaintiff States to redesign or reconfigure the \nphysical facilities they have set up.  Schools today have girls’ and boys’ (or men’s and women’s) \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities.  The Final Rule would require schools to carve out \na separate “gender neutral” option.  And a student who identifies as two-spirited, for instance, \nmay contend that a gender-neutral option is inadequate, given that males and females have \ndedicated intimate facilities such as restrooms. Schools could be forced to create a new restroom \nfor every gender identity, in order to avoid DoED’s definition of discrimination. \n213.  The Final Rule would also require administrative changes from Plaintiff States, \nincluding making changes to application forms for admission or employment, appearance codes, \nand parental and guardian paperwork. \n \n  47 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 48 of 85\n \n214.  These changes would be required even if there were no transgender students or \nstaff at the school, because the Final Rule would extend liability to “students, employees, \napplicants for admission or employment, and other individuals participating in or attempting to \nparticipate in the recipient education program or activity, which could also include parents of \nminor students, students from other institutions participating in events in the resident’s campus, \nvisiting lecturers, to other community members whom the recipient invites to campus.” \n215.  The Final Rule would require Plaintiff States to make these changes even before it \ntakes effect on August 1, 2024, because training and updating forms, codes, and policies take \ntime. \n216.  The Final Rule requires administrative changes because educational institutions \nmust update their sexual assault policies (including literature, public policies, fact sheets, internal \npolicies, handouts, etc.), which would cost money. \n217.  The Final Rule will lead to an increase in the number of investigations \neducational institutions must undertake by as much as ten percent. See 89 Fed. Reg.  33,474. \n218.  The Final Rule requires Plaintiff States to provide leave and other educational and \nemployment benefits to students related to abortions in violation of 20 U.S.C. § 1688. \n219.  The Final Rule would require administrative changes from Plaintiff States to \nupdate leave policies to allow students and employees to take leave related to abortions. \n220.  The Final Rule threatens irreparable harm to K.R, FAU, and FAU members. \n221.  The Final Rule threatens irreparable harm to K.R.’s and FAU members’ right to \nprivacy because (1) Oklahoma law currently ensures that school restrooms will be designated by \nbiological sex and (2) Utah law ensures, with limited exceptions, that private spaces in k-12 \npublic schools and changing rooms in government-owned buildings will be designated by \n \n  48 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 49 of 85\n \nbiological sex. But the Final Rule says that it preempts these state laws and allows males who \nidentify as females to access these sex-designated spaces. \n222.  K.R. and some FAU members want to continue to access girls’ restrooms, locker \nrooms, overnight stays, and showers without the presence of males, but the Final Rule will force \ntheir schools to admit biological males who identify as female to girls-only spaces, causing them \nto feel embarrassment and humiliation. As for K.S. in particular, the Final Rule will cause her to \nstop using girls’ restrooms at school entirely, as she did in the past. \n223.  The Final Rule threatens FAU members’ right to equal athletic opportunities \nbecause FAU has some female members in Kansas, Utah, and Wyoming; those states have laws \nthat require girls’ sports teams to be designated by biological sex. But the Final Rule says it \npreempts these state laws and allows males who identify as females to compete on these \nwomen’s sports teams, causing FAU members who compete on these teams to lose their state \nlegal protections and to risk competing against males. \n224.  The Final Rule also threatens irreparable harm to K.R.’s and some FAU \nmembers’ right to free speech and religious liberty. K.R., and some FAU members (including \nT.P.) want to continue to express their views about gender identity at school as they have done in \nthe past, and want to continue to use pronouns that accurately reflect people’s sex, but they fear \nthat the Final Rule would cause their school to punish them for speaking consistent with their \nbeliefs, particularly for K.R. because other students at her school have already been offended by \nher decision not to use inaccurate pronouns that contradict people’s sex.  Some FAU members \nalso want to continue to express their views that males who identify as female are in fact males, \nthat there are only two sexes, and that males should not access women’s sports and intimate \nspaces, but they fear that the Final Rule would cause their schools to punish them for speaking \n \n  49 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 50 of 85\n \nconsistent with their beliefs. To avoid punishment, starting August 1, some FAU members \n(including T.Z. and Zwahlen) will stop expressing at school their views about gender identity, \nincluding that there are only two sexes and that men who identify as women are in fact men and \nshould not participate in women’s sports.  \n225.  Final Rule also irreparably harms the organizational plaintiffs: Moms for Liberty \nand Young America’s Foundation. \n226.  Moms for Liberty has members across the country whose children currently \nattend schools that receive federal funding and are subject to Title IX regulations. Transgender \nindividuals also attend these schools. \n227.  The Final Rule would result in those schools adopting policies that compel speech \ncontrary to the values and beliefs of Moms for Liberty’s members and their children. \n228.  For example, Merianne Jensen is a member who lives in Virginia and has four \nchildren, D.J., T.J., E.J., and A.J. in public school. Her children are in the 9th, 6th, 6th, and 4th \ngrades respectively. \n229.  Ms. Jensen is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and \nhas raised her children to believe that all human beings—male and female—are created in the \nimage of God and that gender is an essential characteristic of each individual’s premortal, mortal, \nand eternal identity and purpose. Her children believe that biology controls an individual’s sex, \nand that a person’s sex is determined at birth. \n230.  T.J. and E.J. have a peer at their middle school who is biologically a girl but now \nself-identifies as a boy. To date, T.J. and E.J. have continued to call their peer by her girl name \nand continue to use she/her pronouns when referring to their friend. \n \n  50 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 51 of 85\n \n231.  At T.J.’s and E.J.’s school, the principal has already given an assembly that \ninstructed students on the view that some boys identify as girls and some girls identify as boys. \nThe principal counseled the children that everyone should get used to this and accept it because it \nis the future. However, to date, neither T.J. nor E.J. have been reprimanded or disciplined for \nusing biologically accurate pronouns and the transgender student’s birthname.  \n232.  Consistent with their beliefs, T.J. and E.J., in the absence of the threat of \ndiscipline, would continue to use biologically accurate pronouns and their friend’s birthname. \nFurthermore, T.J. and E.J. do not wish to be forced to affirm that an individual born as a female \nis a male. However, out of fear of being disciplined because of the changes to Title IX laid out in \nthe Final Rule, T.J. and E.J. are left with the choice of not expressing themselves in accord with \ntheir beliefs and affirming something contrary to their beliefs. \n233.  Ms. Jensen's children, D.J. and A.J., would also use biologically correct pronouns \nand speak out about issues related to gender identity, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics; \nhowever, they are afraid of being disciplined if the Final Rule is permitted to take effect. Thus, \nbecause of the Final Rule, Ms. Jensen's children D.J. and A.J. will self-censor their views. \n234.  As a second example, Tricia Plank is a member of Moms for Liberty who lives in \nPennsylvania. She has two children, P.M.P. in 9th grade and P.P.P. in 7th grade. She also serves \nas an elected member on her local school board.  \n235.  Ms. Plank’s children attend schools where transgender students are also enrolled. \n236.  Ms. Plank and her two children believe that biology and God determine an \nindividual’s sex and that an individual cannot change his or her sex. \n \n  51 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 52 of 85\n \n237.  Presently, Ms. Plank’s children express views about gender identity and \ntransgenderism while in school. To date, they have received scrutiny from teachers and \nadministration but have not received any reprimands or been disciplined for their speech.  \n238.  Absent the Final Rule becoming effective, Ms. Plank’s children would continue to \nexpress views on these matters. However, out of fear of punishment following the effective date \nof the Final Rule, Ms. Plank’s children would stop expressing views on matters of gender \nidentity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, and transgenderism. \n239.  The impact and irreparable injury of the chill on the First Amendment rights of \nMs. Plank’s children is heightened by recent events in their community.  \n240.  Ms. Plank’s oldest daughter plays tennis on her school’s team. A coach for a team \nagainst which Ms. Plank’s daughter’s team has played and could play again is transgender. This \ncoach, a biological male who seemingly has not undergone transition surgery, has used the \nwomen’s bathroom and changed in a women’s locker room at a tennis tournament that Ms. \nPlank’s daughters attended. He did this in front of young girls.  \n241.  This puts the key issues of gender identity and school locker room and bathroom \npolicies front and center at Ms. Plank’s children’s school. Ms. Plank’s children have expressed \nviews on these matters and would continue to do so absent the Final Rule taking effect. But, due \nto a fear of discipline, Ms. Plank’s children will stop expressing their views about biological \nmales using female restrooms and locker rooms if the Final Rule takes effect. \n242.  As a third example, Debbie Lochner is a chapter chair for Moms for Liberty. She \nlives in New York and has a daughter K.L. who will be attending 9th grade in the fall. \n \n  52 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 53 of 85\n \n243.  Ms. Lochner and her daughter hold strong views on gender identity, including on \npronoun usage and on an individual using a locker room and a dressing room that aligns with the \nperson’s biological sex. \n244.  Ms. Lochner’s daughter is involved in theater, which would require her to use a \ndressing room at school. Furthermore, the high school that Ms. Lochner’s daughter will be \nattending has a mandatory swimming class, requiring her daughter to change in a locker room. \n245.  Ms. Lochner’s daughter would speak out against transgender individuals using \ndressing rooms and locker rooms of their choosing; however, her daughter is a rule follower and \nis afraid of being disciplined and receiving a negative mark on her record if the Final Rule is \npermitted to take effect. Thus, because of the Final Rule, Ms. Lochner’s daughter would censor \nher views. \n246.  As a fourth example, Rebekah Koznek is a vice chair of a chapter of Moms for \nLiberty. Ms. Koznek lives in California and is the mother of E.K. and T.K. E.K. is in 8th grade \nand T.K. is in 5th grade. \n247.  Ms. Koznek and her children believe God created men and women and that \nindividuals cannot change their biological sex. \n248.  Ms. Koznek’s children attend public school. Transgender students are enrolled in \nthe school. One of the transgender students, who is a biological male, used the girls’ locker room \nduring the 2023-24 school year.  \n249.  While doing so, the individual “twerked” in the faces of female students and \nengaged in other attention seeking behaviors that made female students uncomfortable in the \nlocker room. \n \n  53 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 54 of 85\n \n250.  E.K. has been diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum and has speech and \ndevelopmental limitations. \n251.  As a result of E.K.’s disabilities, the presence of a biological male sharing a girls’ \nbathroom or locker room with E.K. would create great confusion for E.K. E.K. is unable to \nprocess such a situation and is unable to modify her use of pronouns to conform to the \nrequirement of the Final Rule.  \n252.  As a result, Ms. Koznek is concerned that a “hostile environment harassment” \ncomplaint will be filed against E.K. and that E.K. will face investigatory and disciplinary action \nif the Final Rule is permitted to take effect \n253.  Ms. Kozek's son T.K. would speak out against girls using the boys’ locker rooms; \nhowever, he is afraid of being disciplined if the Final Rule is permitted to take effect. Thus, \nbecause of the Final Rule, Ms. Koznek’s son would censor his own speech. \n254.  In sum, members of Moms for Liberty and their children would be subject to \npolicies that their schools, which receive federal funding, adopt to conform to the Final Rule. \nTheir children, in turn, out of a reasonable fear that their current speech qualifies as “hostile \nenvironment harassment,” would self-censor their speech. \n255.  Young America’s Foundation has chapters with student members on college \ncampuses around the country, including at Kansas State University and the University of \nWyoming.  \n256.  If the Final Rule takes effect, colleges and universities, including Kansas State \nUniversity and the University of Wyoming, would be forced to adopt policies that chill the First \nAmendment rights of Young America’s Foundation’s members.  \n \n  54 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 55 of 85\n \n257.  Through these policies, universities and colleges would compel students to affirm \nindividuals’ “preferred pronouns” and preferred names. This, in turn, would force Young \nAmerica’s Foundation’s members to espouse and affirm values and beliefs related to issues of \ngender identity with which they strongly disagree and which contradicts their religious beliefs. \n258.  For example, Thomas Adcock is a student at Kansas State University in his Junior \nyear, Mr. Adcock is the Chairman of his university’s Young America’s Foundation chapter. \n259.  Mr. Adcock is also an Army veteran who is attending college with assistance \nfrom the G.I. Bill. \n260.  As a student at Kansas State University, Mr. Adcock has had numerous \ninteractions with individuals identifying as transgender, including interactions within the \nclassroom setting. \n261.  Mr. Adcock is Christian and holds strong views on issues of gender identity, sex \nstereotypes, and sex characteristics. He believes that a person’s sex is determined at birth by \nbiology such that an individual cannot change his sex.  \n262.  In furtherance of these views, in the classroom setting, Mr. Adcock has refused to \nidentify preferred pronouns for himself and has refused to use preferred pronouns of other \nstudents when the preferred pronouns do not match the student’s biological sex. \n263.  To date, Mr. Adcock has not been investigated, given a reprimand, disciplined, or \nforced to attend any educational or training session because of his refusal to use preferred \npronouns. \n264.  Absent the Final Rule taking effect, Mr. Adcock would continue to refuse to use \npreferred pronouns because using preferred pronouns would run contrary to his deeply held \nbeliefs. \n \n  55 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 56 of 85\n \n265.  If the Final Rule is permitted to take effect, Mr. Adcock fears discipline and \nlosing his G.I. Bill funding if he refuses to use another individual’s “preferred pronouns” and \nhonorifics. \n266.  In his role as Chairman of Young America’s Foundation, Mr. Adcock has also \norganized events implicating issues related to gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex \ncharacteristics, and de-transitioning. For example, Mr. Adcock organized movie watch parties \nfor his chapter, at which he played movies such as “What is a Woman” and “Lady Ballers.” Mr. \nAdcock plans to host future movie watch parties featuring films on similar topics and plans to \nhold some of these parties on campus. Mr. Adcock further plans to advertise these parties on his \nuniversity’s grounds. If the Final Rule is permitted to take effect, Mr. Adcock would be deterred \nfrom advertising and hosting movie watch parties featuring films touching on gender identity \nissues out of fear of facing investigatory and disciplinary action. \n267.  Mr. Adcock plans to host future movie watch parties featuring films on similar \ntopics. Mr. Adcock further plans to advertise these parties on his university’s grounds. If the \nFinal Rule is permitted to take effect, Mr. Adcock would, out of fear of facing investigatory and \ndisciplinary action, refrain from advertising and hosting movie watch parties featuring films \ntouching on gender identity issues. \n268.  Mr. Adcock also helped to host a speech by Chloe Cole, an individual who has \nde-transitioned. Mr. Adcock and other members of Kansas State University’s Young America’s \nFoundation’s chapter advertised the speech by writing in chalk on school grounds. Some of the \nmessages included, “Men are not women,” “Protect real women,” “Detransitioner lives matter,” \nand a depiction of the “trans flag” with an x across it. \n \n  56 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 57 of 85\n \n269.  Mr. Adcock did not receive any reprimand or discipline from Kansas State \nUniversity for his role in advertising Chloe Cole’s speech. To the contrary, when complaints \nwere presented to Kansas State University’s Dean of Student Life, the Dean affirmed \nMr. Adcock’s and other Young America’s Foundation members’ right to free speech and used \nthe incident as an opportunity to teach complaining individuals about free speech rights. \n270.  Mr. Adcock reasonably fears that if the Final Rule is permitted to take effect, his \nuniversity’s administration would be forced to investigate the complaints and bring sex \nharassment charges against him for writing messages like “Men are not women” in a location on \nthe university’s grounds.  \n271.  Because of this fear, although Mr. Adcock and his chapter want to host similar \nspeakers and events, including a talk by Matt Walsh called “What is a Woman,” Mr. Adcock is \ndeterred from engaging in these expressive activities. \n272.  Furthermore, because Mr. Adcock and his chapter are deterred from continuing to \nengage in speech on topics involving gender identity, sex stereotypes, and sex characteristics, he \nfears that his chapter will not attract as many new members. \n273.  As a second example, Kailee Verdeyen is a Freshman at the University of \nWyoming. Ms. Verdeyen is a member of her university’s Young America’s Foundation chapter \nand a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. \n274.  Ms. Verdeyen considers herself to be an “old school feminist” and has deeply-\nheld beliefs about women’s rights and supports Title IX’s intent to protect biological women. \nWhile at the University of Wyoming, she has publicly expressed views consistent with these \nbeliefs. \n \n  57 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 58 of 85\n \n275.  Ms. Verdeyen has expressed views on these matters partially because she has had \nuncomfortable experiences with sharing a bathroom with a biological male and because she is \nconcerned that a biological male will join her sorority. Ms. Verdeyen’s concern about her \nsorority is validated by the fact that a biological male joined another sorority at the University of \nWyoming. \n276.  Ms. Verdeyen intends to continue speaking on these issues, including publicly \nprotesting incidents on campus that advance positions contrary to her views and values.  \n277.  However, Ms. Verdeyen reasonably fears that if the Final Rule takes effect, she \nwould face investigatory and disciplinary proceedings for expressing views of this nature.  \n278.  Ms. Verdeyen’s fear of repercussions for expressing her views is heightened \nbecause she anticipates that she would be removed from her position as a student government \nsenator. Accordingly, Ms. Verdeyen plans to engage in self-censorship if the Final Rule takes \neffect. \n279.   Furthermore, Ms. Verdeyen attended her Young America’s Foundation’s chapter \nDe-Transition Day event this year. Ms. Verdeyen had planned to be an active member in the \nchapter during the 2024-25 academic year, with the goal of helping to bring speakers such as \nChloe Cole, Paula Scanlan, or Abby Roth to campus.  \n280.  These three speakers are associated with Young America’s Foundation’s national \norganization, with Ms. Roth offering a speech entitled “Welcome to 2024: Where Men Suck and \nWomen Don’t Exist.”  \n281.  If the Final Rule is permitted to take effect, Ms. Verdeyen is concerned that her \nuniversity would not permit speakers of this nature on campus and that she would face \ninvestigatory and disciplinary proceedings were she to advertise events hosting these speakers. \n \n  58 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 59 of 85\n \nAccordingly, Ms. Verdeyen would no longer pursue efforts to have her chapter of Young \nAmerica’s Foundation host these speakers. \n282.  As a third example, Rachel Flynn is a Freshman at the University of Utah. \nMs. Flynn is a member of her university’s Young America’s Foundation chapter.  \n283.  Ms. Flynn has had numerous interactions with transgender individuals at her \nuniversity. \n284.  Ms. Flynn is of the Christian faith, which informs her belief in the importance of \nbiological sex. Ms. Flynn believes sex is determined at birth and has refused to use preferred \npronouns when in the university setting. Ms. Flynn has not been the subject of any investigatory \nor disciplinary action for refusing to use preferred pronouns.  \n285.  Ms. Flynn wishes to continue to refuse to use preferred pronouns because she \nviews the use of preferred pronouns as an endorsement of the idea that sex is fluid and can \nchange. However, if the Final Rule takes effect, Ms. Flynn will feel compelled to use preferred \npronouns out of fear of being reported for harassment and facing investigatory and disciplinary \nproceedings.  \n286.  Ms. Flynn also believes women deserve private spaces on campus where they do \nnot have to worry about men entering restrooms and locker rooms. Ms. Flynn places great \nweight on her right to free speech and has voiced opinions on these matters. Additionally, Ms. \nFlynn might confront a biological male if she encountered one in the women’s restroom. \n287.  However, if the Final Rule takes effect, Ms. Flynn will feel compelled to stop \nspeaking on these issues for fear of being reported for harassment and facing investigatory and \ndisciplinary proceedings. \n \n  59 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 60 of 85\n \n288.  As a member of Young America’s Foundation, Ms. Flynn attended events hosted \nby the organization, including a speech by Chloe Cole on detransitioning, a speech by Michael \nKnowles on transgenderism, and a screening of the movie “Damaged.” Ms. Flynn and her Young \nAmerica’s Foundation chapter are considering bringing speakers to campus who would talk \nabout gender identity issues during the 2024-25 academic year, including Matt Walsh, who gives \na speech entitled “What is a Woman.” If the Final Rule is permitted to take effect, Ms. Flynn is \nconcerned that her university would not permit Mr. Walsh to give his speech and that she would \nface investigatory and disciplinary proceedings were she to distribute advertisements for Mr. \nWalsh’s speech. Accordingly, Ms. Flynn is deterred from pursuing efforts to host Mr. Walsh. \n289.  Also, as a member of her Young America’s Foundation chapter, Ms. Flynn has \ntabled and distributed flyers about gender identity issues, including flyers with the slogans “Men \ncannot become women.” Ms. Flynn planned to engage in these activities during the 2024-25 \nacademic year. However, if the Final Rule takes effect, Ms. Flynn is deterred from engaging in \nthese activities for fear of facing investigatory and disciplinary proceedings.  \n290.  The injury to Ms. Flynn’s First Amendment rights by the chilling of this speech is \nexacerbated by the fact that proponents of gender identity are very active on her campus. In the \npast, other students have chalked messages like “Trans lives matter” and “Men can become \nwomen.”  \n291.  As a result of the Final Rule, Ms. Flynn reasonably believes that while her \nmessage of “Men cannot become women” would qualify as hostile environment harassment, the \ncounter message of “Men can become women” would not qualify as hostile environment \nharassment. \n \n  60 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 61 of 85\n \n292.  In sum, members of Young America’s Foundation would be subject to policies \nthat their schools, which receive federal funding, adopt to conform to the Final Rule if it takes \neffect. Their members, in turn, out of a reasonable fear that their current speech qualifies as \n“hostile environment harassment,” would self-censor their speech. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nAgency Action That Is Contrary to Law \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n \n293.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n294.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) . . . not in accordance with law; . . . [or] (C) in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n295.  The Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds DoEd’s statutory authority because \nit violates the plain language of Title IX and because Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 is inapplicable to Title IX’s materially different language and a \nmaterially different purpose. \n296.  The Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds DoEd’s statutory authority because \nBostock’s interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—even if it were somehow \ninstructive—recognizes and rests on two biological sexes, not “gender identity.” \n297.  The Final Rule is contrary to law because Title IX nowhere refers to “gender \nidentity,” the Title IX term “sex” does not include “gender identity,” and Title IX’s prohibition \nof discrimination “on the basis of sex” does not encompass discrimination based on “gender \nidentity.” \n298.  The Final Rule is contrary to law because Title IX and longstanding DoEd \nregulations explicitly permit distinctions based on biological sex in certain circumstances. \n \n  61 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 62 of 85\n \n299.  The Final Rule is contrary to law because the purpose of Title IX was to protect \nequal opportunities for women and girls in education, which in 1972 would have been \nunderstood to refer to biological women and girls, not a biological male who “identified” as a \nwoman.  \n300.  The Final Rule is contrary to law because the purpose of Title IX was to protect \nequal opportunities for women and girls in education and the Final Rule deprives some FAU \nmembers, K.R., and other students of the equal opportunity to enjoy educational benefits and \nfacilities such as access to sex-specific facilities like restrooms and locker rooms.  \n301.  The Final Rule is contrary to law because the purpose of Title IX was to protect \nequal opportunities for women and girls in athletics and the Final Rule erases protections for \nwomen and girls in athletics. \n302.  20 U.S.C. § 1688 states “Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or \nprohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit, including use of \nfacilities, related to an abortion” (emphasis added).  The Final Rule is contrary to this section \nbecause it requires educational institutions to provide leave and other employment or educational \nbenefits in connection with any condition related to pregnancy, which the Final Rule defines to \ninclude termination of pregnancy (i.e. abortion). \n303.  Title IX does not have grant extraterritorial jurisdiction.  It does not authorize \nDoEd to withhold federal funding from a school just because someone associated with the school \ndid not accommodate any person’s “gender identity” anywhere in the world.  \n304.  The Final Rule is also contrary to law because it violates the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993.  \n305.  RFRA provides that the “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s \n \n  62 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 63 of 85\n \nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.” 42 U.S.C. \n2000bb-1(a). “If the Government substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion, under the \nAct that person is entitled to an exemption from the rule unless the Government “demonstrates \nthat application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental \ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental \ninterest.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 694–95 (2014). RFRA applies to \nany “department or agency” of the United States, including the DoEd. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb–2(1). \n306.  By requiring students like K.R. and school staff to speak or use pronouns in a \nmanner that violates their religious beliefs or restricts their religiously motivated speech about \ngender identity, the Final Rule violates RFRA. DoEd has no compelling interest in requiring or \nrestricting such speech, and DoEd’s construction of “sex-based” harassment is not the least \nrestrictive means of furthering that interest. \n307.  The Final Rule is contrary to Title IX and RFRA and therefore is unlawful and \nshould be set aside. \n \nCOUNT II \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction and in Violation of Separation of Powers  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 1 \n \n308.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n309.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] \n(D) without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n \n  63 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 64 of 85\n \n310.  The Final Rule is final agency action subject to judicial review under the APA.  \nId. § 704. \n311.  The Final Rule is a “rule[]” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(2). \n312.  The DoEd and DOJ are “agencies” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(1). \n313.  Under the constitutional separation of powers, each branch of government has \nbeen vested with different powers.  “All legislative Powers” granted by the Constitution “shall be \nvested in . . . Congress.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  The Constitution does not vest executive \nagencies with legislative powers. \n314.  Separation of powers principles prohibit an agency from deciding an issue of \ngreat economic or political significance, or issues traditionally governed by state or local law, \nabsent clear authorization from Congress to do so.  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 724 \n(2022) (discussing the “major questions” doctrine); id. at 743 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \nDeparture from longstanding past practice (without new authorization from Congress) is strong \nevidence the agency is acting without Congressional authorization.  See Nat’l Fed’n Indep. Bus. \nv. Dep’t of Lab., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) [hereinafter NFIB]. \n315.  The Final Rule invokes the major questions doctrine because questions regarding \nthe relationship between “gender identity,” biological sex, and First Amendment freedoms are \nissues of vast political significance, subject to “‘earnest and profound debate across the \ncountry.’”  Id. at 743 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (quoting Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 267–\n68 (2006)). \n316.  Parents, teachers, and school boards can all reasonably disagree about how to \naccommodate students’ “gender identities” and how to balance the privacy and dignity needs of \nall their students, within the confines of state law and the Constitution.  The Final Rule removes \n \n  64 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 65 of 85\n \nall of that discretion.  It effectively turns schools into indoctrination factories that push DoEd’s \npreferred progressive viewpoint. \n317.   The Final Rule also greatly departs from DoEd’s fifty-year-long interpretation of \n“sex,.” \n318.  The role that biological sex plays in educational programs and activities \n(including women’s and girls’ sports)—and, indeed, the relative importance of gender identity as \nopposed to biological sex in many areas of daily life—is likewise an issue of political \nsignificance that is subject to extensive debate across the country. \n319.  DoEd must therefore show Congress “plainly authorize[d]” the Final Rule.  NFIB, \n595 U.S. at 117. \n320.  Nothing in the Title IX Amendments to the Civil Rights Act clearly authorizes \nDoEd to resolve this debate by unilaterally deciding “harassment on the basis of sex” now \nincludes “gender identity.” \n321.  Nothing in Title IX gives DoEd clear authorization to replace “sex” with “gender \nidentity.” \n322.  The Final Rule harms students by opening up women’s locker rooms and \nrestrooms to biological males and men’s restrooms and locker rooms to biological females.  It \nrequires schools to place students in rooms consistent with their “gender identity,” rather than \nbiological sex, during overnight stays or trips. \n323.  Nor does Title IX clearly authorize DoEd to change the conditions on which \nStates have relied for decades (namely, that biological males and biological females should be \ntreated equally). \n \n  65 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 66 of 85\n \n324.  While Congress is no doubt aware of the issue, it has chosen not to rewrite Title \nIX’s definition of “sex” as DoEd attempts to do.  Members of Congress have introduced \nlegislation that would accomplish this, see, e.g., H.Res. 269 (2023), but Congress has chosen not \nto act.  By acting unilaterally, Defendants have “seiz[ed]he power of the Legislature.”  Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2023). \n325.  DoEd therefore has no clear authorization to replace the word “sex” with concepts \nof “gender identity,” nor can it reinterpret Title IX in such a broad, unreasonable way.  DoEd \nexceeded its authority when it issued the Final Rule. \n326.  In addition to making these changes, the Final Rule makes major changes to \ncampus sexual assault investigations and to how educational institutions must accommodate \nstudents and employees regarding their abortions.   \n327.  All three of these issues are the subject of national debate, are politically \nimportant, and are subjects Congress should debate and decide.  Nothing in Title IX clearly \nauthorizes DoEd to end that debate and decide it for themselves.  The Final Rule, taken as a \nwhole, implicates and violates the major questions doctrine and should be set aside. \n328.  The Final Rule also implicates the major questions doctrine because DoEd seeks \nto intrude into education which is a domain of the state.  See West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 744 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring).  “When an agency claims the power to regulate vast swaths of \nAmerican life, it not only risks intruding on Congress’s power, it also risks intruding on powers \nreserved to the States.”  Id. (internal citation omitted). \n329.  Education has always been a particular domain of state law and DoEd’s power in \nthat domain has traditionally been limited.  This Final Rule seeks to intrude upon “vast swaths of \n \n  66 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 67 of 85\n \nAmerican life” through trying to remake the American education system.  Furthermore, the Final \nRule would pre-empt multiple laws in each of the Plaintiff States.   \n330.  The “longstanding clear-statement rule-the federalism canon-also applies in these \nsituations.”  Id.  “To preserve the ‘proper balance between the States and the Federal \nGovernment’ and enforce limits on Congress’s Commerce Clause power, courts must ‘be certain \nof Congress’s intent’ before finding that it ‘legislate[d] in areas traditionally regulated by the \nStates.’”  Id. (citing Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 459-60 (1991)).   \n331.  Nothing in Title IX (or any other law) gave the Defendants clear authorization to \nintrude upon this domain of state law through fundamentally remaking the education system and \npre-empting state laws along the way.   \n332.  Even if the Final Rule does not implicate the major questions doctrine, it still \nviolates the separation of powers.  DoEd’s new interpretation of Title IX is so far afield from any \nreasonable interpretation of the statute that the Final Rule amounts to an unconstitutional act of \nlegislative power.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. \n333.  Thus, the Final Rule violates separation of powers and should be set aside. \nCOUNT III \nAgency Action That Violates the Spending Clause \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 \n \n334.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n335.  The Final Rule is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the Spending Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. \n336.  The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to “attach conditions on the receipt of \n \n  67 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 68 of 85\n \nfederal funds,” but the “spending power is of course not unlimited.”  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 \nU.S. 203, 206-07 (1987). \n337.   “[I]f Congress desires to condition the States’ receipt of federal funds, it ‘must do \nso unambiguously . . . , enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the \nconsequences of their participation.’”  Id. at 207 (citation omitted). \n338.  Any condition placed on the receipt of such funds must relate directly to the \ncentral purpose of Congress in creating the spending program. Id. at 208-9. \n339.  Also, Congress may not use its spending power to “indirectly coerce[] a State to \nadopt a federal regulatory system as its own.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 578 (2012) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). \n340.  Defendants’ interpretation of Title IX in the Final Rule violates the Spending \nClause because it purports to impose obligations on Plaintiff States that Congress did not clearly \nimpose in Title IX, which is contrary to the requirement that Congress must “unambiguously” \ncondition the receipt of federal financial assistance.  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207. \n341.  In addition, the purposes of the Final Rule bear no direct relationship to the \npurposes of Title IX as outline by Congress. This violates the constitutional limits of the \nSpending Clause. Id. \n342.  The Final Rule would change the conditions on which states accepted federal \nfunding. \n343.  The Final Rule would change to whom educational institutions are liable for sex-\ndiscrimination by incorporating “gender identity” in sex and by including people other than \nstudents and staff in the definition of “person.” \n344.  The Final Rule would change what educational institutions are liable for by \n \n  68 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 69 of 85\n \nincorporating “gender identity” in sex and by lowering the bar on what constitutes discrimination \nto include de minimis harm. \n345.  The Final Rule would require Plaintiff States to set policies (or risk losing federal \nfunding) based on nebulous terms for which DoEd does not provide any definitions.  \n346.  Even if DoEd could change the conditions attached to receipt of federal funds, the \nchange proposed in the Final Rule is impermissibly vague and contradictory.   \n347.  A school may run afoul of the Final Rule if it incorrectly assumes a student’s \n“gender identity” (or “perceives” the student as male or female based on the student’s \nappearance), but it may not ask what the student’s “gender identity” or biological sex is.   \n348.  The school may have sex-separate sports’ teams, but the separation cannot be \nbased on “sex-stereotypes” about athletic ability.  If the school does away with sex-separation \naltogether, it may violate women and girls’ rights by denying them equal opportunities.  In any \nscenario, the school would run the risk of losing federal funding because it cannot comply with \nthe Final Rule and Title IX. \n349.  The Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because it jeopardizes Plaintiffs’ \nreceipt of billions of dollars of education-related federal funding if they were to refuse or \notherwise fail to comply with the Final Rule, resulting in Plaintiffs having “no real option but to \nacquiesce” to the Final Rule.  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 582 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.); see also \nTennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at 828. \n350.  At a minimum, if it is ambiguous whether the Final Rule comports with Title IX, \nthe Court should find it does not because it raises these serious constitutional concerns. \n351.  The Final Rule is unlawful and should be set aside because it violates the \nconstitutional limits on the Spending Clause. \n \n  69 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 70 of 85\n \nCOUNT IV \nAgency Action That Violates the First Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, U.S. Const. amend. I \n \n352.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein.  \n353.  Defendants’ interpretation of Title IX in the Final Rule is “not in accordance with \nlaw,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the \nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and conditions the receipt of federal funds on \nrecipients violating the First Amendment rights of others. \n354.  Defendants’ interpretation of Title IX in the Final Rule conflicts with the First \nAmendment’s protection of religious liberty.  In Bostock, the Court did not consider whether its \ninterpretation of Title VII violated the religious liberty protections of the First Amendment \nbecause the employers had not raised the issue.  140 S. Ct. 1731, 1754 (2020).  It left open the \npossibility that a federal law that required employers to treat employees consistently with their \ngender identities, rather than their biological sex, could raise free exercise concerns.  Id. \n355.  The Final Rule would require individual teachers, coaches, and school \nadministrators to acknowledge, affirm, and validate students’ “gender identities” regardless of \nthe speakers’ own religious beliefs on the matter in violation of the First Amendment.  303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 596 (2023).  The Final Rule would require schools to \nadopt policies concerning this. \n356.  The Final Rule would require K.R., some FAU members, and students like them \nto speak Defendants’ message on gender identity in violation of their religious liberty and \nfreedom of expression under the First Amendment.  The Final Rule also precludes K.R., some \nFAU members, and other students from sharing certain beliefs about gender identity in violation \n \n  70 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 71 of 85\n \nof their religious liberty and freedom of expression under the First Amendment. The Final Rule \nalso chills and deters the protected expression of some FAU members who will stop expressing \ncertain views at school in violation of their religious liberty and freedom of expression under the \nFirst Amendment.  \n357.  Schools and school districts would be required to adopt policies related to “gender \nidentity”—including polices related to restrooms, locker rooms, pronoun, and honorific use—\neven if there are no transgender students enrolled, because the Final Rule extends to guests of the \nschool or visitors to campus.  Therefore, the Final Rule imposes unconstitutional conditions on \nPlaintiffs’ receipt of federal education-related funds.  Dole, 483 U.S. at 210. \n358.  Further, Plaintiff States have laws protecting freedom of speech, freedom of \nconscious, and freedom of religion that arguably conflict with the Final Rule.  They will likely \nnot be able to enforce these laws if the Final Rule takes effect.  Tennessee, 615 F. Supp. 3d at \n828. \n359.  The Final Rule is unlawful and should be set aside because it violates the First \nAmendment and imposes unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funds. \n360.  At a minimum, if it is ambiguous whether the Final Rule comports with Title IX, \nthe Court should find that it does not because DoEd’s interpretation of Title IX (if accepted) \nwould raise serious constitutional doubt as to whether Title IX violates the First Amendment.  \nCOUNT V \nViolation of First Amendment \n(Compelled Speech) \n \n361.  Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation reallege all the \nabove paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n362.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that “freedom of thought and expression \n \n  71 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 72 of 85\n \n‘includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.'” Harper & \nRow, Publishers v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985) (quoting Wooley v. Maynard, 430 \nU.S. 705, 714 (1977)).  \n363.  To this end, “[t]here is necessarily, and within suitably defined areas, a . . . \nfreedom not to speak publicly, one which serves the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in \nits affirmative aspect.” Id. (quoting Estate of Hemingway v. Random House, Inc., 244 N.E.2d \n250, 255 (N.Y. 1968)). \n364.  “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, \nhigh or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other \nmatters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” Janus v. \nAFSCME, Council 31, 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2463 (2018) (quoting W. Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, \n319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943)). “Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find \nobjectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such \neffort would be universally condemned.” Id. \n365.  “When speech is compelled . . . additional damage is done. In that situation, \nindividuals are coerced into betraying their convictions. Forcing free and independent individuals \nto endorse ideas they find objectionable is always demeaning, and for this reason, one of our \nlandmark free speech cases said that a law commanding ‘involuntary affirmation’ of objected-to-\nbeliefs would require ‘even more immediate and urgent grounds’ than a law demanding silence.” \nId. at 2464 (quoting Barnette, 319 U.S. at 633). \n366.  The Final Rule forces the children of members of Moms for Liberty and members \nof Young America’s Foundation to, at the risk of investigation and discipline upon refusal, \naffirm a transgender student’s selected sex by using preferred pronouns even though the member \n \n  72 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 73 of 85\n \nor child has a deeply held belief that sex is determined by God and/or biology. \n367.  Courts have held that requiring individuals to use preferred pronouns violates the \nprotection against compelled speech afforded by the First Amendment. See Meriwether v. \nHartop, 992 F.3d 492, 510 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that forced preferred pronoun usage violated \nthe First Amendment and stating, “the premise that gender identity is and idea ‘embraced and \nadvocated by increasing numbers of people is all the more reason to protect the First Amendment \nrights of those who wish to voice a different view’” (quoting Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. \n640, 660 (2000)); Darren Patterson Christian Acad. v. Roy, No. 1:23-cv-01557-DDD-STV, \n2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198528, at 48−54 (D. Colo. Oct. 23, 2023) (granting preliminary \ninjunction against state anti-discrimination provision requiring preferred pronoun usage). \n368.  It is irrelevant that the Final Rule would not literally force any student to engage \nin speech. The use of pronouns is a “‘virtual necessity’” for engaging in any conversation, \nespecially since Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation have members \nwho have engaged in discussions about gender identity and desire to do so in the future. Doe 1 v. \nMarshall, 367 F. Supp. 3d 1310, 1325 (M.D. Ala. 2019) (quoting Wooley, 430 U.S. at 715).  \n369.  The Final Rule would prohibit students “from speaking in accordance with [their] \nbelief that sex and gender are conclusively linked,” and trying not to “use any pronouns” would \nbe “impossible to comply with.” Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 517. The Final Rule “cannot force \n[students] to choose between carrying a government message” and remaining silent in another \nstudent’s presence at school. Doe 1, 367 F. Supp. 3d at 1326. \n370.  Also, the Final Rule would require students to make statements that they believe \nto be false and affirm ideologies that violate their deeply-held beliefs. See also Wooley, 430 U.S. \nat 715 (state cannot require message on license plates, even though no one is required to drive); \n \n  73 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 74 of 85\n \nHurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos., 515 U.S. 557, 575-76 (1995) (parade \norganizers cannot be forced to include certain groups in a parade, even though no one is required \nto hold a parade). \n371.  In announcing the Final Rule, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the DoEd \naffirmatively stated the Office for Civil Rights’ view that instances “Deadnaming” or \n“misgendering” with respect to gender identity would give rise to hostile environment \ndiscrimination in some instances.  \n372.  The Final Rule cannot compel affirmance of Defendants’ preferred viewpoint \n(e.g., that a human can change genders, hold multiple genders, or no gender at all) and ban the \nopposing viewpoint (e.g., that sex is immutable, and assigned by God). “To hold differently \nwould be to treat religious [or traditionally conservative] expression as second class speech and \neviscerate this Court’s repeated promise that [students] do not ‘shed their constitutional rights to \nfreedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.’” Kennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2425 (quoting \nTinker, 393 U.S. at 506). \n373.  Allowing the Final Rule to take effect would, therefore, violate the First \nAmendment’s protection against compelled speech. \nCOUNT VI \nViolation of First Amendment, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment \n(Vagueness and Overbreadth Resulting in Chilled Speech) \n \n374.  Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation reallege \nParagraphs 1- ____ as if fully set forth herein. \n375.  The First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit restrictions that are \nunconstitutionally vague. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972) (“It is a basic \nprinciple of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly \n \n  74 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 75 of 85\n \ndefined.”.) This requirement furthers two purposes: (1) to provide fair notice to the citizenry of \nwhat is outlawed and (2) to provide standards for enforcement to officials. \n376.   A restriction is unconstitutionally vague if it “either forbids or requires the doing \nof an act in terms so vague that [individuals] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at \nits meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.” \nConnally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1925)). “With respect to the second goal, … ‘if \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit \nstandards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters \nto [officials] for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.’” (Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09) \n(emphasis added). \n377.  Vague policies raise due process concerns because they force individuals to guess \nat their meaning. Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108–09. As a result of this vagueness, individuals “steer \nfar wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly \nmarked.” Id. at 109 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).    \n378.  “[C]onstitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ effect of \ngovernmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First \nAmendment rights.” Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 11 (1972) (citing Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., \n401 U.S. 1 (1971); Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Lamont v. Postmaster \nGen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964)). \n379.  And when policies by their reach “prohibit[] constitutionally protected conduct” \nand chill speech as a result, they are unconstitutionally overbroad on their face. Grayned, 408 \nU.S. at 114; accord Forsyth Cnty. v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129-130 (1992). \n380.  Vague and overbroad policies are also unconstitutional because they give officials \n \n  75 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 76 of 85\n \nunfettered discretion to approve or censor speech based on its viewpoint or content. Forsyth \nCnty., 505 U.S. at 130–33. \n381.  If a restriction “interferes with the right of free speech,” then a stringent test for \nvagueness applies. Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, \n499 (1982); Scull v. Va. ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform & Racial Activities, 359 U.S. 344, 353 \n(1959) (“Certainty is all the more essential when vagueness might induce individuals to forego \ntheir rights of speech, press, and association for fear of violating an unclear law.”). \n382.  The Final Rule lacks any precise definitions, detail, context, or notice to students \nabout what constitutes sexual harassment, sex, gender identity, or what sorts of statements are \ncan create sex-based discrimination or hostile environment harassment. This provision fails to \ndeliver adequate notice, guarantees arbitrary enforcement and is therefore unconstitutional. \n383.  For this reason, Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation \nhave members who fear penalties for engaging in discussions that that they have had and would \ncontinue to have, but for the Final Rule. \n384.  Allowing the Final Rule to take effect would, therefore, violate the First and \nFourteenth Amendment’s protections against vagueness and overbreadth. \nCOUNT VII \nViolation of First Amendment \n(Content and Viewpoint Discrimination Resulting in Chilled Speech) \n \n385.  Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation reallege all the \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n386.  The Final Rule’s revised definition of harassment is a classic restriction that \nregulates based on content and viewpoint. See, e.g., Saxe, 240 F.3d at 206 (bans on \n“‘harassment’” that include speech impose “‘content-based’” and “‘viewpoint-discriminatory’” \n \n  76 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 77 of 85\n \nrestrictions on that speech); Meriwether, 992 F.3d at 507-09 (requiring affirmance of a person’s \ngender identity that is inconsistent with the person’s biological sex is viewpoint discrimination). \n387.  Chilled speech is a recognized First Amendment injury. See Laird, 408 U.S. at 11 \n(1972) (citing Baird, 401 U.S. 1; Keyishian, 385 U.S. 589; Lamont, 381 U.S. 301; Baggett, 377 \nU.S. 360). \n388.  Both Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation have \nmembers who have spoken critically on gender identity, and wish to speak, or hold critical \nspeakers on gender identity in the future. \n389.  Both Plaintiffs Moms for Liberty and Young America’s Foundation have \nmembers who will refrain from speech because they are concerned about a credible threat of \nenforcement of the Final Rule should they continue speaking. \n390.  Because the Final Rule discriminates based on viewpoint, it is presumptively \nunconstitutional.  \n391.  Regardless, under any balancing test, the Final Rule violates the First \nAmendment. Defendants cannot show that they have a compelling interest to justify restricting \nspeech. Even if they did, Defendants cannot show that any such interest is narrowly tailored. See \nKennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2421 (Once speech is impinged, “the focus then shifts to the defendant to \nshow that its actions were nonetheless justified and tailored consistent with the demands of … \ncase law.”). \n392.  Allowing the Final Rule to take effect would, therefore, violate the First \nAmendment. \nCOUNT VII \nAgency Action That Violates the Tenth Amendment \n5 U.S.C. § 706, U.S. Const. amend. X \n \n \n  77 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 78 of 85\n \n393.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n394.  The Final Rule is “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C), because it violates the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  \n395.  The Final Rule interprets and applies Title IX in a way that intrudes on the States’ \nhistoric and traditional authority to safeguard privacy expectations in educational settings and \nprovides no evidence Congress intended that result.  The Tenth Amendment provides that “[t]he \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, \nare reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  Federal law does not preempt State law \nin areas traditionally reserved to the States unless Congress expressed a “clear and manifest” \nintent to do so.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). \n396.  Under the Spending Clause, only Congress, and not an executive agency, has the \nconstitutional power to preempt a contrary state law (U.S. Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2)—and only then \nin the exercise of a power clearly delegated by the Constitution to Congress. \n397.  The “management of public schools” and institution-level decisions are powers \ntraditionally reserved to the States.  See Tennessee v. United States Dep’t of Agric., 665 F. Supp. \n3d 880, 918 (E.D. Tenn. 2023). \n398.  The Rule has no basis in Title IX, so the statute does not evidence a clear and \nmanifest intent of Congress to redefine “sex.”  And it goes further than requiring the States to \nadminister a federal program in a uniform way.  It regulates schools at an institution-level \n(requiring them to change their single-sex restrooms and locker rooms) and at a team level \n(requiring them to accept certain players). \n \n  78 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 79 of 85\n \n399.  The Final Rule purports to preempt state laws that protect the privacy of K.R., \nsome FAU members, and other students like them, requiring schools to force students to share \nrestrooms and other intimate spaces with members of the opposite sex. \n400.  The Final Rule purports to preempt state laws that protect the equal athletic \nopportunities of some FAU members and other students like them, requiring schools to force \nfemale athletes to compete against members of the opposite sex.  \n401.  The Rule is unlawful and should be set aside because it violates the Tenth \nAmendment. Relatedly, it attempts to exercise preemptive power held only by Congress. \nCOUNT IX \nAgency Action that is Arbitrary and Capricious  \n5 U.S.C. § 706 \n \n402.  All of the above paragraphs are realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n403.  The Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider the reliance \ninterests of the Plaintiffs and their entities.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCalifornia, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020). \n404.  Since the dawn of human history, it has been widely recognized that there are two \nsexes: male and female, which, in nearly all cases, can be determined at birth. \n405.  The Final Rule ignores this, in place codifying new theories on “gender identity.” \n406.  Since the passage of Title IX, schools have designed their educational programs, \nactivities, sports teams, and very structures with this in mind.  They have invested time, money, \nstaff, and resources in building, developing, and maintaining these programs. \n407.  The Final Rule would require Plaintiffs and their entities to completely change \nthese to accommodate this radical new thinking. \n \n  79 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 80 of 85\n \n408.  The Final Rule would require Plaintiffs and their entities to establish new \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities for individuals who do not identity as either male or \nfemale, such as separate bathrooms for two-spirited and agender individuals.  \n409.  With respect to schools’ responsibility to investigate claims of sex discrimination \nand assault, the Final Rule acknowledges that “some reports regarding occurring in a recipient’s \neducation program or activity may be handled under these final regulations while other [those \nthat occurred before the August 1, 2024 effective date] will be addressed under the requirements \nof the 2020 amendments.”  89 Fed. Reg. 33,841.   \n410.  DoEd claims this is not “arbitrary” because overlap occurs “any time regulatory \nrequirements are amended prospectively,” but it fails to consider the cost to educational \ninstitutions in maintaining dual investigative and quasi-judicial systems. \n411.  The Final Rule changes and greatly expands the definition of “sexual harassment” \nwith respect to hostile environment discrimination, drawn from the Gebser/Davis definition in \nthe 2020 Amendments.   \n412.  While the Final Rule expresses DoEd’s opinion that it can set a different standard \nfor administrative enforcement than for judicial enforcement, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,842, it does not \naddress the State reliance interest on the 2020 definition in the administrative enforcement \ncontext.  Failure to address an important concern makes the Final Rule arbitrary and capricious. \n413.   The Final Rule does not address the State’s reliance interest in the definition of \n“sexual harassment” from the 2020 Amendments, which applied to administrative enforcement \nas well as civil liability. \n414.  The Final Rule expressly declines to define key terms.  \n \n  80 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 81 of 85\n \n415.  The Final Rule’s new “interpretation” of Title IX is so convoluted and \nimplausible it cannot be ascribed to a difference in agency expertise. \n416.  The Final Rule is also arbitrary and capricious because it departs sharply from \npast practice without reasonable explanation and with no legal basis.  See Dep’t of Homeland \nSec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020). \n417.  Throughout Title IX’s history, DoEd enforced Title IX to protect girls and women \nfrom discrimination in education.  This makes sense since that is why Title IX exists in the first \nplace. \n418.  The Final Rule seeks to upend that prior practice by incorporating a definition of \nsex-based harassment that includes gender identity.   \n419.  Rather than provide a reasonable explanation for this sharp departure from past \npractice, DoEd denies such a departure at all. \n420.  Instead the Final Rule states that that its amendments, “clarify the scope and \napplication of Title IX and the obligations of recipients of Federal financial assistant from the \nDepartment.” 89 Fed. Reg. 33474.   \n421.  By stating the Final Rule’s purpose is to “clarify,” DoEd is effectively denying \nthat a sharp departure from past practice is occurring at all.  Consequently, they did not provide a \nreasonable explanation for such a departure. \n422.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious and should be set aside. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF AND DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \n(1)  A declaratory judgment holding the Final Rule unlawful;  \n(2)  A declaratory judgment holding that Plaintiff States are not bound by the Final Rule; \n \n  81 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 82 of 85\n \n(3)  A declaratory judgment affirming that Plaintiff States and Title IX recipients located \ntherein may continue to separate students by biological sex in appropriate circumstances \nin accordance with Title IX’s statutory text and longstanding DoEd regulations; \n(4)  A declaratory judgment that Title IX does not prohibit Plaintiff States and Title IX \nrecipients located therein from maintaining showers, locker rooms, restrooms, residential \nfacilities, and other living facilities separated by biological sex or from regulating each \nindividual’s access to those facilities based on such individual’s biological sex; \n(5)  A declaratory judgment that Title IX does not require a Title IX recipient’s employees or \nstudents to use an  individual’s preferred pronouns or honorifics;  \n(6)  A declaratory judgment that Title IX does not prohibit Plaintiff States and Title IX \nrecipients located therein from maintaining athletic teams separated by biological sex or \nfrom assigning an individual to a team based on such individual’s biological sex; \n(7)  A declaratory judgment holding that DoEd lacked authority to issue the Final Rule; \n(8)  A judgment setting aside the Final Rule; \n(9)  A preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, \nservants, employees, attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or \nparticipation with those individuals from enforcing the Final Rule; and \n(10)  A stay of the effective date of the Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705 prohibiting \nDefendants and their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and any other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with those individuals from enforcing \nthe Final Rule during the pendency of this litigation. \n(11)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements, including \nattorney’s fees, associated with this litigation; and \n \n  82 \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041   Document 1   Filed 05/14/24   Page 83 of 85\n \n(12)  Grant Plaintiffs such additional and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted this fourteenth of May, 2024, \n \n \n \nKRIS W.

The motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for decision.  (Docs. 25, 38, 43, 45, 47.)  \nPlaintiffs seek an injunction forbidding the “Final Rule”—as that term is defined herein—from \ngoing into effect on August 1, 2024.  (Doc. 24 at 1.)  The court held a hearing on the motion on \nJune 20, 2024.  For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is \nGRANTED. \nI.  Facts and Procedural History \n  At its core, this case involves statutory interpretation of the word “sex” as that term is used \nin Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et. seq.  The court begins \nwith the history of Title IX and a review of the previous regulations issued by Defendant United \nStates Department of Education (the “DoE”). \n  In short, Title IX’s text mandates that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \nof  sex,  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \nassistance . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Title IX was enacted on June 23, 1972, after a lengthy \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 2 of 47\nbattle.  See Tennessee v. Cardona, 2024 WL 3019146, at *2 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024) (discussing \nthe history of Title IX).  Title IX was “patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  \nCannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 684–85 (1979).  When the provisions were introduced \nin the Senate for debate, Senator Bayh commented that the “heart of this amendment is a provision \nbanning sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds.  The amendment \nwould  cover  such  crucial  aspects  as  admissions  procedures,  scholarships,  and  faculty \nemployment.”  N. Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 524 (1982) (quoting 118 Cong. Rec. \n5,803 (1972)).  He stressed that “one of the great failings of the American educational system is \nthe continuation of corrosive and unjustified discrimination against women.”  118 Cong. Rec. at \n5,803.  He urged the passage of the amendment to “root out . . . the social evil of sex discrimination \nin education.”  Id. at 5,804.  It was clear to all that “Title IX was enacted in response to evidence \nof pervasive discrimination against women with respect to educational opportunities.”  McCormick \nex rel. McCormick v. Sch. Dist. of Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 286 (2d Cir. 2004). \nThere are exemptions to Title IX, including those for religious organizations, military \ninstitutions, and social fraternities.  § 1681.  Also, institutions of undergraduate higher education \nwhich  traditionally  and  continually  only  admitted  students  “of  one  sex”  were  exempt.  \n§ 1681(a)(5).  Further, § 1686 states that “nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit \nany educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living \nfacilities for the different sexes.”  Congress also passed legislation authorizing federal agencies \nwhich are empowered to extend federal financial assistance to an education program or activity to \nissue rules or regulations that are consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute.  20 \nU.S.C. § 1682. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 3 of 47\n  The United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare promulgated final \nregulations in 1975 concerning Title IX.1  Bell, 456 U.S. at 515.  The Title IX regulations included \nregulations in the area of athletics.  High schools and colleges were given three years to comply \nwith the regulation on athletics which required equal opportunities for “members of both sexes” \nto participate in athletics.  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c), (d).  The regulations also provided that a recipient \n“may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such \nfacilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for \nstudents of the other sex.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.33. \n  Amendments to the regulations became effective on November 24, 2006, to “clarify and \nmodify Title IX regulatory requirements pertaining to the provision of single-sex schools, classes, \nand extracurricular activities in elementary and secondary schools.” Nondiscrimination on the \nBasis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 71 Fed. \nReg. 62530-01 (Oct. 25, 2006) (codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.34).  The third major amendment to \nthe regulations occurred in 2020.  These amendments addressed sex-based harassment as a form \nof sex discrimination, a recipient’s obligation to address sexual harassment, grievance procedures, \nand implemented remedies for victims.  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education \nPrograms or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 85 Fed. Reg. 30026-01 (May 19, \n2020) (codified in Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations).  This was the first time that the \nregulations addressed sexual harassment and included a definition for that term.  § 106.30. \n  On June 15, 2020, the United States Supreme Court issued Bostock v. Clayton County, \nGeorgia, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  The Court held that an employer violates Title VII of the Civil \n \n1 “HEW’s functions under Title IX were transferred in 1979 to the Department of Education by § 301(a)(3) of the \nDepartment of Education Organization Act, Pub. L. 96-88, 93 Stat. 678, 20 U.S.C. § 3441(a)(3) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).”  \nBell, 456 U.S. at 516, n.4. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 4 of 47\nRights Act of 1964 by firing an individual for being homosexual or transgender.  Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 683.  On January 8, 2021, the DoE issued a memorandum regarding Bostock.  See U.S. \nDep’t of Educ., Memorandum Re: Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) at 1 (Jan. 8, \n2021) (rescinded in 2021), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/correspondence/other/ogc-\nmemorandum-01082021.pdf.  Notably, DoE stated that Bostock did not “construe Title IX,” and \nthat the “Title IX text is very different from Title VII text in many important respects,” including \nthat Title IX “contains numerous exceptions authorizing or allowing sex-separate activities and \nintimate facilities to be provided separately on the basis of biological sex or for members of each \nbiological sex.”  Tennessee v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 22-5807, ---F.4th---, 2024 WL 2984295, at *2 \n(6th Cir. June 14, 2024) (quoting the January 8, 2021, memorandum).  As the Sixth Circuit has \nnoted, however, the new Biden administration has an “opposite take” on Bostock.  Id. \n  On March 8, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order tasking the Secretary of \nEducation to review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and other similar \nagency actions to determine whether they were inconsistent with the Administration’s policy that \nall students be guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex \nand discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  See Exec. Order No. \n14,021, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803 (Mar. 8, 2021).  On June 22, 2021, the DoE published its interpretation \nof Title IX in the Federal Register.  Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light \nof Bostock v. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021).  Notably, this document is \ncurrently enjoined from being applied to several States, including Plaintiffs Alaska and Kansas.  \nTennessee, 2024 WL 2984295, at *26–27.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 5 of 47\nOn July 12, 2022, the DoE published the proposed regulations in the Federal Register.  The \nDoE received more than 240,000 comments on the proposed regulations.   See Nondiscrimination \non the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, \n89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33477 (Apr. 29, 2024), the “Final Rule.”  The Final Rule slightly modified \nsome of the proposed regulations based on the comments and is set to take effect on August 1, \n2024.  According to the Final Rule, the DoE amended the regulations to “better align the Title IX \nregulatory requirements with Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,474.  The \nFinal Rule’s main changes identified by the DoE include a change in the grievance procedures for \ncomplaints of sex discrimination, clarifying that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination \nincludes different forms of sex-based harassment and a modification to the definition of that term, \nand clarifying that sex discrimination “includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex \ncharacteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  Id. at \n33,476. \n  With respect to the expansion of what constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, DoE \nbelieves that its definition of sex discrimination is “consistent with the Department’s statutory \nauthority under Title IX, prior and current Department guidance, various Executive Orders, and \nFederal case law precedents.”  Id. at 33,804.  In support, DoE repeatedly references the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Bostock throughout the Final Rule.  DoE acknowledges that the Supreme Court \nexpressly stated that its decision in Bostock was only applicable to Title VII but relies on that \ndecision for authority to promulgate the new regulations. \n  The new regulations also amend § 106.31 to add a provision related to differential treatment \nor separation on the basis of sex which is permitted under the statute or regulations.  A recipient \nmust not carry out “such different treatment or separation in a manner that discriminates on the \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 6 of 47\nbasis of sex by subjecting a person to more than de minimis harm.”  Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. 106.31(a)(2).  The regulation defines “more than de minimis harm” as \n“[a]dopting a policy or engaging in a practice that prevents a person from participating in an \neducation program or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity.”  Id.  The regulation \nstates that § 106.31(a)(2) is not applicable to the aforementioned statutory exemptions to Title IX \nand the corresponding regulations to those exemptions.  Id.  DoE contends that the new regulation \nwould not apply to sex-separate athletic teams permitted under § 106.41(b) as that regulation is \ncarved out in § 106.31(a)(2).  Fed. Reg. at 33,819.  Section 106.31(a)(2) would apply to bathrooms \nand shower facilities.  Id. at 33,819.  Further, it would also apply to single-sex classes or portions \nof classes, such as physical education, that are allowed under the current regulations.  Id.   \nThe term “gender identity” is not defined in the new regulations.  The DoE determined that \nit was not necessary to define the term.  But the term is understood as “an individual’s sense of \ntheir gender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned at birth.”  Id. at 33,809.  \nThe DoE did not specify how a school should determine a student’s gender identity.  Id. at 33,819.  \nHowever,  requiring  a  “student  to  submit  to  invasive  medical  inquiries  or  burdensome \ndocumentation requirements to participate in a recipient’s education program or activity consistent \nwith their gender identity imposes more than de minimis harm.”  Id.   \nFurther, the Final Rule amends the definitions for sexual harassment.  The previous version \nof  § 106.30  in  which  sexual  harassment  was  addressed  has  been  removed  and  there  are \namendments  to  the  definition  section  (§ 106.2)  which  include  a  definition  for  “sex-based \nharassment.”  Id. at 33,884.  The Final Rule also changes the grievance procedures with respect to \nthe process that is required after a sex discrimination complaint is filed. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 7 of 47\nPlaintiffs filed this complaint on May 14, 2024.  (Doc. 1.)  Plaintiffs include the States of \nKansas,  Alaska,  Utah,  and  Wyoming.    Plaintiffs  also  include  K.R.,  a  minor,  and  three \norganizations: Moms for Liberty, Young America’s Foundation, and Female Athletes United (the \n“Plaintiff Organizations”).  Plaintiffs allege that the Final Rule is contrary to law, in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, arbitrary and capricious, violates separation of powers principles, violates \nthe Spending Clause, and violates the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment \nholding the Final Rule unlawful and other related declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs also seek a \npreliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule, as \nwell as a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date.  Plaintiff States all receive federal funding for their \nschools and are thus required to comply with the Final Rule.  A failure to comply with Title IX \nmay result in termination of federal funding.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Plaintiff States assert that the \nFinal Rule conflicts with laws passed in their states such as laws regarding separate facilities and \nrestrooms for both sexes and prohibiting males from competing against females in sports.  (Doc. \n25 at 25–26.)   \nPlaintiff K.R. attends a public middle school in Oklahoma.  K.R. has submitted an affidavit \nin support of the motion.  K.R. states that she has encountered biological males using the girls’ \nrestroom in her school.  (Doc. 25-4 at 3.)  She was very uncomfortable using the restroom with a \nbiological male and did not feel safe. Because she didn’t feel safe, she remarkably refused to use \nthe restroom at school during this time period in which transgender students were allowed to use \nthe restroom which corresponded with their gender identity.  Although most of the biological males \nusing the girls’ restroom identified as females, K.R. attested that on some occasions biological \nmales who did not identify as female used the girls’ bathroom because they knew they could get \naway with it.  (Id.)  Oklahoma passed a law which prohibits students from using a bathroom that \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 8 of 47\ndoes not align with their biological sex.  Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, § 1-125.  After the passage of this \nlaw, K.R. returned to using the school bathroom.  She fears, however, that the Final Rule will allow \nbiological males to use the girls’ bathroom.   \nAdditionally, K.R. is a Christian who believes that God created two sexes, male and female.  \nShe also believes that a person cannot change their sex.  K.R. believes that it violates her religious \nbeliefs to use a pronoun for an individual when that pronoun does not accurately reflect their sex.  \nShe has spoken on her beliefs at school.  K.R. fears that she will be punished under the Final Rule \nfor declining to use a student’s preferred pronouns and for expressing her religious beliefs.  (Doc. \n25-4 at 6.) \n   Plaintiff Moms for Liberty is a national organization.  (Doc. 43-6.)  Its members’ children \nattend schools that receive federal funding.  Its members include Merianne Jensen, Tricia Plank, \nDebbie Lochner, and Rebekah Koznek, who have all submitted declarations in support of the \nmotion for injunctive relief.  Ms. Jensen lives in Virginia and has minor children in the Prince \nWilliam County School District.  (Doc. 25-12 at 3.)  Ms. Plank lives in Pennsylvania and has minor \nchildren in the Upper Adams School District.  (Doc. 25-15.)  Ms. Lochner lives in New York and \nhas a minor student in the Newark Central School District.  (Doc. 25-16.)  Ms. Koznek lives in \nCalifornia and has minor children in the Atascadero Unified School District.  (Doc. 25-13.)  The \nmembers declare that they and their children have deeply-held religious beliefs regarding gender \nidentity and transgender issues similar to the beliefs of K.R.  They also share the belief that \nindividuals should use the bathroom that aligns with their biological sex.  (Docs. 25-13 at 2; 25-\n15 at 2; 25-16 at 2.)  The members further state that their children share those views and have \nexpressed them at their schools.  (Docs. 25-12, 25-13, 25-15, 25-16.)  Similar to K.R., their \nchildren have continued to use pronouns that align with biological sex based on their religious \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 9 of 47\nbeliefs.  They fear, however, that the Final Rule will subject them to school discipline for \nexpressing statements related to gender identity.  Moms for Liberty has set also forth evidence that \nits mission would be impeded by the Final Rule by deterring its members and their children from \nexpressing their viewpoints about gender identity and transgenderism in schools and by placing \nthem in uncomfortable and unsafe positions in private places such as restrooms and locker rooms.   \n(Doc. 43-6.) \n  Plaintiff Young America’s Foundation is a national organization devoted to promoting \ntraditional values and providing students with resources to advance such values on college \ncampuses.  (Docs. 1 at 7; 43-7 at 2.)  Young America has chapters on campuses across the country \nand including Kansas State University, the University of Utah, and the University of Wyoming.  \n(doc. 43-7 at 2.)  Young America’s members at these schools include declarants Thomas Adcock, \nRachel Flynn, and Kailee Verdeyen.  All three have similar beliefs to K.R.  They plan to bring \nspeakers to campus to discuss these issues with similar viewpoints and to personally engage in \ndiscussion on their views.  (Docs. 25-11, 25-10, 25-14.)  They are concerned that the Final Rule \nwill subject them to investigatory or disciplinary proceedings and are afraid that they will be \ndeterred from organizing events and speaking their views. \n  Plaintiff Female Athletes United (“FAU”) is an organization that was formed to defend \nequal opportunity, fairness, and safety in women’s and girls’ sports.  (Doc. 25-5.)  FAU members \nA.R.S., T.P., and T.Z. attend public schools in Kansas, Wyoming, and Utah.  All three are minor \nstudents and play girls’ sports at their schools and they currently do not have to play against \nbiological males because of current state laws.  They also want to continue to speak freely about \ntheir views on women’s sports, sharing intimate spaces with biological males, and issues related \nto gender identity.  They are concerned that they will be forced to express messages that they do \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 10 of 47\nnot agree with and want to continue speaking about their opinions on these issues in school.  They \nare also concerned about having to share private places such as bathrooms and locker rooms with \nbiological males.  Sharing these intimate places make them feel uncomfortable and unsafe.  (Docs. \n25-7, 25-8, 25-17.) \nOn May 24, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs seek a stay of \nthe Final Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705 prohibiting enforcement of the Final Rule during the pendency \nof this litigation.  Defendants oppose the motion.  The court held a hearing on the matter on June \n20.  At the hearing, the court heard oral argument from the parties and took the matter under \nadvisement.  The court has also reviewed an amici brief in support of Defendants filed by the \nAttorney General of New Jersey on behalf of several States that are not parties.  (Doc. 41.)  These \nStates oppose the relief requested by Plaintiffs. \nThe court notes that there are several actions pending throughout the United States in which \nthe plaintiffs in those cases raise similar claims and most of which have also sought injunctive \nrelief.  (See Doc. 36 at 3) (citing cases).  At this time, two courts have issued decisions granting \ninjunctive relief to the plaintiffs in those cases and enjoining the DoE from enforcing the Final \nRule.  See Louisiana, et al. v. Dep’t of Ed., et al., No. 3:24-CV-00563, 2024 WL 2978786, at *2 \n(W.D. La. June 13, 2024); Tennessee v. Cardona, No. CV 2: 24-072-DCR, __ F. Supp.3d __, 2024 \nWL 3019146, at *1 (E.D. Ky. June 17, 2024).  Those courts limited injunctive relief to the plaintiff \nStates in those cases.  This court joins those courts in granting injunctive relief to Plaintiffs as set \nforth herein. \nII.  Standard \nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), a reviewing court shall hold unlawful \nand set aside agency actions when the court finds such actions to be “(A) arbitrary, capricious, an \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 11 of 47\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, \npower, privilege, or immunity; or (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nFurther, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, a court reviewing a final rule may stay the effective \ndate of agency action pending conclusion of the review proceedings.  In determining whether to \nstay the effective date of the final rule, the court applies the same four factors traditionally used to \nanalyze a request for a preliminary injunction.  Colorado v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 989 F.3d 874, \n883 (10th Cir. 2021); cf. Winkler v. Andrus, 614 F.2d 707, 709 (10th Cir. 1980) (explaining that a \n§ 705 stay is a provisional remedy in the nature of a preliminary injunction).  The four factors \nwhich must be shown by the movant to obtain preliminary injunctive relief include: (1) the movant \nis substantially likely to succeed on the merits; (2) the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the \ninjunction is denied; (3) the movant’s threatened injury outweighs the injury the opposing party \nwill suffer under the injunction; and (4) the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  \nId.  The third and fourth factors “merge” when the government is the party opposing the injunction.  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nBecause a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the movant’s right to relief \nmust be clear and unequivocal.  First Baptist Church v. Kelly, 455 F. Supp. 3d 1078, 1084 (D. \nKan. 2020); see also Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  “Additionally, \nsome preliminary injunctions are disfavored and require a stronger showing by the movant—viz., \nmovants must satisfy a heightened standard.  They are ‘(1) preliminary injunctions that alter the \nstatus quo; (2) mandatory preliminary injunctions; and (3) preliminary injunctions that afford the \nmovant all the relief that it could recover at the conclusion of a full trial on the merits.’”  Fish v. \nKobach, 840 F.3d 710, 723–24 (10th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted.)  “In seeking such an injunction, \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 12 of 47\nthe movant must make a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on the merits \nand with regard to the balance of harms.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nIII.  Analysis \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction staying the effective date of the Final Rule.  In \nsupport, Plaintiffs contend that they will prevail on all of their claims.  Plaintiffs contend that the \nFinal Rule is contrary to Title IX, violates the major questions doctrine, violates the Spending \nClause and the individual Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and is arbitrary and capricious.2  The \ncourt begins with the issue of standing and then turns to the arguments on the merits.  Ultimately, \nthe court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on several claims and, as such, are entitled to \ninjunctive relief. \nA.  Standing \nThe court has a duty to determine whether a party has standing if the court believes that \nthere is an issue or if standing is raised by the parties.  See Nova Health Sys. v. Gandy, 416 F.3d \n1149, 1154 (10th Cir. 2005).  In their response brief, Defendants only challenge standing with \nrespect to Plaintiffs’ claim that the regulation violates RFRA.  (Doc. 38 at 44–46.)  Constitutional \nstanding requires (i) that the plaintiff suffer an “injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury \nwould likely be redressed by judicial relief.”  TransUnion v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) \n(citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–561 (1992)).  These requirements ensure \nthat “the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant \n[the] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.”  Laufer v. Looper, 22 F.4th 871, 876 (10th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)).  Where, as here, a \n \n2 While Plaintiffs raise additional arguments, the court declines to address those at this time in light of its finding that \nPlaintiffs will prevail on the issues addressed herein. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 13 of 47\nplaintiff seeks prospective relief such as an injunction, “the plaintiff must be suffering a continuing \ninjury or be under a real and immediate threat of being injured in the future.” Tandy v. City of \nWichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1283 (10th Cir. 2004). “The threatened injury must be certainly impending \nand not merely speculative.”  Id. (quotations and citation omitted).  Plaintiffs have the burden to \nestablish standing.  See Gandy, 416 F.3d at 1154. \nThe court has no trouble finding that Plaintiffs have established standing with respect to \ntheir claims.3  The Plaintiff States have laws pertaining to students’ privacy and separation of \nstudents by their biological sex.  The Plaintiff States allege that the Final Rule interferes with their \nsovereign right to create and enforce their own laws, imposes administrative costs and burdens, \nand requires Plaintiff States to redesign or reconfigure their physical facilities.  (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 209, \n210, 212.)  States have an interest in “the exercise of sovereign power over individuals and entities \nwithin the relevant jurisdiction—this involves the power to create and enforce a legal code, both \ncivil and criminal.”  Texas v. Cardona, No. 4:23-CV-00604-O, ---F. Supp. 3d.---, 2024 WL \n2947022, at *11 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2024) (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, \nex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982)).  Here, Plaintiffs contend that DoE seeks to regulate Title \nIX in a manner that is not compatible with their state laws.  See K.S.A. § 72-6286(a) (requiring \nthat overnight accommodations on school travel be separated by sex of the student); Alaska Stat. \n§ 14.18.040 (requiring that schools provide showers, toilets, and training-room facilities for both \nsexes for athletic or recreational purposes): Utah Code Ann. § 63G-31-301(1) (restrooms and \nchanging  rooms  must  correspond  to  the  student’s  sex);  and  Wyo.  Stat.  Ann.  §  21-25-102 \n \n3 In any event, even if the individual Plaintiffs do not have standing on their RFRA claim, standing as to the other \nclaims addressed herein has been plausibly alleged and this court’s decision to grant preliminary injunctive relief is \nbased on Plaintiffs’ claims as addressed herein.  Further, “the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to \nsatisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.”  Rocky Mountain Peace & Just. Ctr. v. United States Fish & \nWildlife Serv., 40 F.4th 1133, 1153, n.19 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst. Rts., Inc., 547 \nU.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)). \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 14 of 47\n(separating athletic activities by sex).  Recipients of federal education funding in Utah are faced \nwith having to either comply with Title IX or state law regarding bathroom use.  As a result, those \nschools would have to reconfigure all bathrooms to comply with both state law and the Final Rule.  \n(Doc. 25-3 at 3.)   \nFurther, new duties are imposed under the Final Rule that were not required under the prior \nregulations.  The States must now investigate allegations of sex discrimination based on gender \nidentity  discrimination.    The  States  must  comply  with  the  requirement  of  new  policies  in \naccordance with the Final Rule and hire Title IX coordinators to make sure the policies are carried \nout.  (Docs. 25-2, 25-3.)  This is sufficient to show an injury for standing purposes.  Further, \nPlaintiff States have standing due to the alleged injuries to their state universities.  See Tennessee, \n2024 WL 2984295, *4 (quoting Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 370, 371 (1953) (holding that \nArkansas had Article III standing to represent the interests of the University of Arkansas because \nunder Arkansas law “the University of Arkansas is an official state instrumentality” and “any \ninjury . . . to the University is an injury to Arkansas”).  They are also threatened with a loss of \nfederal funding if they fail to comply with the Final Rule.  Id. at *5.  The States have further \nsufficiently alleged that their injury is traceable to Defendants and redressable by a favorable \nruling.  See id. at *7; see also Texas, 2024 WL 2947022 at *18–19. \nNext, K.R. and the Plaintiff Organizations have put forth evidence by way of declarations \nas discussed herein.  In those declarations, K.R. and the Plaintiff Organizations’ members attest to \ntheir religious beliefs that there are two sexes, a person’s sex cannot be changed, and that they \nbelieve that they must use pronouns which align with a person’s biological sex.  They have all \nespoused these views at their schools.  In light of the Final Rule, however, they are fearful that \nthey would be subject to investigation and potential discipline for continuing to speak their views.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 15 of 47\nThe court finds that K.R. has standing to challenge the Final Rule.  See Kansas Judicial Review v. \nStout, 519 F.3d 1107, 116–17 (10th Cir. 2008) (discussing standing with respect to a First \nAmendment claim). \nTurning to the Plaintiff Organizations, they have standing to sue on behalf of their members \nwhen (1) their members have standing in their own right; (2) the interests at stake are relevant to \nthe organization's purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the \nindividual members to participate in the lawsuit.  See Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv., \n528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000).  Based on the affidavits submitted by the members of the Plaintiff \nOrganizations, the court finds that those members have established standing to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the Final Rule based on a potential chilling of their speech in violation of the \nFirst Amendment.  See Parents Defending Educ. v. Linn Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 83 F.4th 658, 666 \n(8th Cir. 2023) (“Parents have standing to sue when the practices and policies of a school threaten \nthe rights and interests of their minor children.”) (citing Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle \nSch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 718–19 (2007)).  In their supplemental briefing, Defendants contend \nthat the affidavits fail to show that the members face imminent, irreparable injury outside of the \nPlaintiff States.  (Doc. 47 at 3.)  This argument, however, is focused on the scope of relief.  It does \nnot suggest that this deprives the Plaintiff Organizations of standing. \nNext, the interest at stake must be relevant to the organization’s purpose.  All three Plaintiff \nOrganizations have submitted declarations setting forth their purpose.  Moms for Liberty is a \nnationwide organization with chapters across the country.  Moms for Liberty’s mission is to defend \nthe fundamental right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their values and morals.  \n(Doc. 43-6.)  Its mission would be impeded if the Final Rule went into effect by deterring its \nmembers  and  their  children  from  expressing  their  viewpoints  about  gender  identity  and \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 16 of 47\ntransgenderism in schools and by placing them in uncomfortable and unsafe positions in private \nplaces such as restrooms and locker rooms.  Id.  YAF is a national organization with “thousands \nof student members on college campuses across the country” and in all fifty states.  (Doc. 43-7.)  \nTheir mission is to ensure that young Americans are inspired by the ideas of individual freedom, \na strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values.  Id.  Those values include the \nbelief that sex is determined at birth, “there are two sexes/genders, and an individual cannot change \nhis or her sex/gender.”  Id. at 2.  If the Final Rule goes into effect, it will impede the mission by \ndeterring their members from engaging in discussion about gender identity and transgenderism \nand it will deter students from hosting speakers who discuss these issues.  Id. at 3.  Finally, one of \nFAU’s purposes and goals is that its members can “freely advocate in favor of fairness in women’s \nsports at their schools.”  (Doc. 25-5 at 9.)  This includes empowering its members to express views \nthat males should not be permitted on women’s teams or in private spaces such as restrooms and \nlocker rooms.  FAU members also want to express their beliefs that male athletes who identify as \nfemale are in fact males.  Id. at 8.  FAU is concerned that its members will lose their scholarships, \nprivacy, and freedom of speech.  Based on this review, the court finds that the interests at stake \nare relevant to the Plaintiff Organizations’ purposes. \nFinally, neither the claim nor the relief sought requires that the individual members \nparticipate.  Plaintiffs are merely seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  (Doc. 1 at 81–83.)  As \nsuch, the individual members do not need to participate.  See New Mexico ex rel. Richardson v. \nBureau of Land Mgmt., 565 F.3d 683, 696 n.13 (10th Cir. 2009). \nBased on the foregoing, the court finds that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Final \nRule. \nB.  Preliminary Injunction Element One: Prevail on the Merits \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 17 of 47\ni.  Contrary to Law \nPlaintiffs argue that the final regulation is contrary to the plain language of Title IX in \ndefining sex discrimination as discrimination on the basis of gender identity.  The court must first \nlook to the statute to determine its meaning.  “After all, only the words on the page constitute the \nlaw adopted by Congress and approved by the President.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 654.  Further, the \ncourt is to interpret a statute “in accord with the ordinary public meaning of its terms at the time \nof its enactment.”  Id.  The Supreme Court recently held that the court “need not and under the \nAPA may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.”  \nLoper Bright Enter. v. Raimondo, ---S. Ct.---, 2024 WL 3208360, *22 (June 28, 2024).  The court \nmust exercise its “independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its \nstatutory authority, as the APA requires.”  Id. \nTitle IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \nAt issue here is Title IX’s command that an individual not be discriminated against “on the basis \nof sex.”  Therefore, the court must determine the ordinary meaning of this command.  Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 654.  After review, the court finds that the unambiguous plain language of the statutory \nprovisions and the legislative history make clear that the term “sex” means the traditional concept \nof biological sex in which there are only two sexes, male and female.  See Nat’l Ass’n of Home \nBuilders v. Defs. of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 666 (2007) (discussing that the “words of a statute must \nbe read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.”) \nDefendants do not dispute that at the time Title IX was enacted in 1972, the term “sex” was \nunderstood to mean the biological distinctions between males and females and conceded as such \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 18 of 47\nduring the hearing.  Tr. at 27–28; see Bostock, 590 U.S. at 655 (assuming that “sex” in Title VII \nreferred only to the “biological distinctions between male and female”); see also Grimm v. \nGloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 632–33 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) \n(Niemeyer, J. dissenting) (collecting dictionary definitions) (discussing that in 1972, “virtually \nevery dictionary definition of ‘sex’ referred to the physiological distinctions between males and \nfemales—particularly  with  respect  to  their  reproductive  functions.”);  Tennessee,  2024  WL \n3019146, at *9 (citing The American College Dictionary 1109 (1970) and Webster’s Third New \nInternational Dictionary 2081 (1971) (sex was defined as “one of the two divisions of organic \n[sic] esp. human beings respectively designated male or female”). \nThe legislative history also supports a finding that the term “sex” referred to biological sex.  \nAs discussed, one of the principal purposes of the statute was to root out discrimination against \nwomen in education.  The legislative history shows that Congress was concerned about the unequal \ntreatment between men and women for admissions opportunities, scholarships, and sports.  The \nlegislative history provided statistics on the number of women and men being included in various \nprograms and activities.  118 Cong. Rec. at 5,804–06.  The legislative history is clear that Congress \nwas referring to the biological sex of both males and females. \nThe text of the statute also supports a finding that the term “sex” meant biological sex and \nnot  gender  identity  or  sexual  orientation.    Title  IX  explicitly  provides  exceptions  to  the \nnondiscrimination mandate.  In one exception, the statute discusses that Title IX will not apply for \na period of time to an institution which “admits only students of one sex” while that institution \ntransitions to “being an institution which admits students of both sexes.”  § 1681(a)(2).  In another \nexception discussing “father-son” and “mother-daughter” activities, the statute states that such \nactivities, if provided for “one sex,” shall not be precluded for the “other sex” as long as the “other \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 19 of 47\nsex” has opportunities for “reasonably comparable activities.”  § 1681(a)(8).  Therefore, it is clear \nfrom the statutory language that the term “sex” refers to the traditional binary concept of biological \nsex.  That is also supported by the ordinary meaning of the word “sex” at the time Congress enacted \nTitle IX.  Given this background, the plain language of “sex” in Title IX does not mean “gender \nidentity.” \nDefendants do not make much effort to dispute that the term “sex” in Title IX means \nbiological sex.  Rather, Defendants argue that this makes no difference because discrimination on \nthe basis of gender identity is discrimination on the basis of biological sex.  (Doc. 38 at 19.)  \nTherefore, the final regulation is not contrary to Title IX.  In support of their position, Defendants \nrely on Bostock and other cases citing Bostock in support, including the Tenth Circuit’s recent \ndecision applying Bostock to the Equal Protection clause.  See Fowler v. Stitt, No. 23-5080, ---\nF.4th---, 2024 WL 3035712 (10th Cir. June 18, 2024).4 \nThe “only question” in Bostock, however, was “whether an employer who fires someone \nsimply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that \nindividual ‘because of such individual's sex’” in violation of Title VII.  590 U.S. at 681.  First and \nforemost, Bostock involved a different statute, Title VII, which prohibits sex discrimination in \nemployment.  Although the statutes are similar in that they both prohibit sex discrimination, there \nare notable differences.  Significantly, Title IX includes several carve outs to the prohibition on \nsex discrimination that are not present in Title VII.  See § 1681(a)(1)–(9).  Further, Title IX is \nabout schools, and “the school is not the workplace.”  Adams by & through Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of \n \n4 The court also notes that in an unpublished opinion the Tenth Circuit assumed for purposes of an appeal “that under \nTitle IX, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is sex-based discrimination.”  Dimas v. Pecos Indep. Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Educ., No. 23-2064, 2024 WL 1881076, at *8, n.9 (10th Cir. Apr. 30, 2024).  This statement was contained \nin a footnote without discussion.  Because the issue here was not presented to the court of appeals for review and the \ndecision was unpublished, Dimas is neither binding nor helpful.  United States v. Austin, 426 F.3d 1266, 1274 (10th \nCir. 2005) (“[U]npublished orders are not binding precedent . . . .”) \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 20 of 47\nSt. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 808 (11th Cir. 2022) (citing Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., \n526 U.S. 629, 651 (1999) (“Courts, moreover, must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adult \nworkplace.”); id. at 675 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting the “differences between children and \nadults, peers and teachers, schools and workplaces” and that “schools are not workplaces and \nchildren are not adults”).  The Supreme Court also explicitly declined to address any other laws \nand the meaning of their terms or whether its holding would be applicable to “bathrooms, locker \nrooms, or anything else of the kind.”  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 681.   \nIf Bostock expressly disavowed its application to bathrooms and showers under Title VII, \nit certainly has no application to bathrooms and showers under Title IX.  Moreover, Bostock arose \nin a situation where the plaintiffs were employees of private businesses who were fired because of \ndecisions they made as consenting adults regarding their private lives, and those decisions caused \nno harm to their employers, coworkers, or anyone else for that matter.  In that sense, Bostock can \nfairly  be  described  as  a  live-and-let-live  decision  where  employers  were  prohibited  from \ninterfering with their employees’ personal lifestyle choices when those choices had no bearing on \nthe employees’ abilities to perform their jobs.  By contrast, this case involves the government’s \ndecision to interpose itself into the field of education, an area traditionally left to state and local \ngovernments and the schools, themselves, and in which the government’s edicts result in the \nsubordination of the interests of non-transgender students (many of whom are minors) in free \nspeech, privacy, and safety to the interests of transgender students in expressing and conducting \nthemselves in accordance with their individual notions of gender identity.  These differences, \namong others, demonstrate why the reasoning from Bostock does not automatically transfer to the \nTitle IX context, nor does Bostock compel the changes to the Title IX regulations encompassed by \nthe Final Rule. \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 21 of 47\nNotwithstanding these differences, Defendants assert that the Final Rule’s definition of sex \ndiscrimination is not contrary to law because “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for \nbeing transgender ‘without discriminating against that individual based on sex.’” (Doc. 38 at 12)( \nquoting Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660).  In repeating this quote throughout their brief, however, \nDefendants are ignoring Title IX’s carve outs which explicitly allow discrimination based on \n(biological) sex.  These carve outs show that Congress recognized that recipients could properly \ndiscriminate on the basis of sex under certain circumstances.  Therefore, not all differential \ntreatment based on biological sex is discrimination under Title IX.  Rather, Title IX “prohibits \ndifferential treatment that disfavors, denies, excludes, or otherwise treats one biological sex worse \nthan the other.  But Title IX does not prohibit differential treatment that allows for sex-separation \nor sex-specific benefits, provided that one biological sex is not treated as inferior to the other in \nthe process.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *31. \nSpecifically, Title IX provides that a recipient may maintain “separate living facilities for \nthe different sexes.”  20 U.S.C. § 1686.  This “instruction is the authoritative expression of \nCongress’s view that separating the two sexes ‘where personal privacy must be preserved’ is not \nthe type of discrimination prohibited by the statute.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *32 (citing 118 \nCong. Rec. 5,807 (Feb. 28, 1972)).  The Final Rule essentially renders meaningless the exemptions \nin Title IX.  Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *11.  The DoE argues that the Final Rule protects \nthose exemptions because they are excepted from the new discrimination standard which provides \nthat  \na recipient must not carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner \nthat discriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than de \nminimis harm, except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) through (9) and the \ncorresponding regulations §§ 106.12 through 106.15, 20 U.S.C. 1686 and its \ncorresponding regulation § 106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b). Adopting a policy or \nengaging in a practice that prevents a person from participating in an education \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 22 of 47\nprogram or activity consistent with the person’s gender identity subjects a person \nto more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \n  DoE explains that this provision continues to allow sex separation based on biological sex \nwith respect to the statutory exceptions and the regulations regarding housing and athletics.  \nEssentially, under DoE’s interpretation, a recipient may deny the request of a male student who \nidentifies as female to live in a female dormitory because that is a living facility.  By contrast, a \nrecipient may not deny that same male student access to the girls’ restroom, shower, or locker \nroom because the regulation that allows sex separate facilities for restrooms and locker rooms will \nnow be subject to the new rule under which such conduct is categorically deemed to result in more \nthan de minimis harm to a transgender person.  DoE’s justification is that Congress has allowed \nsex segregation in, and only in, those limited circumstances identified in the statutory text.  DoE’s \nexplanation does not pass muster because the “comparable facilities,” i.e. bathrooms and locker \nrooms, impacted by the Final Rule appear to fall under the statutory category of living facilities.  \n34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  The statute does not define “living facilities.”  However, the implementing \nregulations enacted after the passage of Title IX and §§ 106.32 and 106.33 directly correspond \nwith § 1686.  Section 106.32 deals with “housing,” and § 106.33 with “comparable facilities.”  \nAlthough the final regulations were “published without public comment,” § 106.33 “was meant to \ncover” § 1686.  A.C. by M.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760, 770 (7th Cir. 2023).  \nBathrooms and locker rooms would be facilities that are used for activities of daily living such as \nbathing and dressing.  Given Congress’s stated concern about privacy for students, it would be \ncounterintuitive if that privacy only extended to students who lived in student housing. \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the Final Rule is contrary to Title IX in that it would allow \nbiological men to play on women’s sports teams.  Defendants, however, argue that the athletics \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 23 of 47\nregulation is not impacted by the new rule.  The Final Rule’s proposed § 106.31(a)(2) does include \nthe athletics regulation as a circumstance in which a policy may lawfully cause more than de \nminimis harm to students.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887.  There is also a proposed rule that will \namend the athletics regulation.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,839 (citing 88 Fed. Reg. 22,862.)  Because \nthe proposed rule is not final and the Final Rule carves out an exception for the athletics regulation, \nthe court has not considered the arguments on athletics in ruling on whether the agency acted \nwithout statutory authority in promulgating the Final Rule.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at \n*14 (declining to consider the effect of the Final Rule on sports at the preliminary injunction stage \ndue to the proposed rule). \nSignificantly,  the  purpose  of  Title  IX  was  to  protect  “biological  women  from \ndiscrimination in education[;] [s]uch purpose makes it difficult to sincerely argue that, at the time \nof enactment, ‘discrimination on the basis of sex’ included gender identity, sex stereotypes, sexual \norientation, or sex characteristics.”  Id., at *12.  The DoE’s reinterpretation of Title IX to place \ngender identity on equal footing with (or in some instances arguably stronger footing than) \nbiological sex would subvert Congress’ goals of protecting biological women in education.  The \nFinal Rule would, among other things, require schools to subordinate the fears, concerns, and \nprivacy interests of biological women to the desires of transgender biological men to shower, dress, \nand share restroom facilities with their female peers.  Moreover, to expand sex discrimination to \nencompass “self-professed and potentially ever-changing gender identity is inconsistent with Title \nIX’s sex-separation dictates.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *38 (citing Doe 2 v. Shanahan, 917 \nF.3d 694, 723 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Williams, J., concurring in the result).  Because of these significant \ndifferences between Title IX and Title VII, uniformly applying Bostock to Title IX  is not \nappropriate and would contradict the purpose of Title IX.  Although not briefed by the parties, the \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 24 of 47\nTenth Circuit’s decision in Fowler does not compel a different decision for the same reasons.  \nThere, the question was whether purported discrimination based on transgender status was sex-\nbased discrimination that implicated the Equal Protection clause.  2024 WL 3035712, at *13.  Here, \nthe sex-based categories of Title IX are explicit—and the question is what the text of Title IX \nrequires as a result. \n  The Final Rule’s interpretation of sex and discrimination are therefore contrary to the \nstatute and historical context of Title IX.  The court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \ntheir  claim  that  the  DoE  exceed  its  statutory  authority  in  expanding  the  definition  of  sex \ndiscrimination in the Final Rule.  See Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, *13; Louisiana, 2024 WL \n2978786, *12. \nii.   Major Questions Doctrine \n  As discussed herein, the term “sex” is unambiguous as used in Title IX.  Moreover, under \nRaimondo,  even  if  that  term  was  ambiguous,  it  no  longer  results  in  deference  to  DoE’s \ninterpretation of the meaning of “sex” under Title IX.  2024 WL 3208360, at *22.  The court \ntherefore does not defer to the agency’s interpretation of Title IX with regard to the Final Rule.  \nThe  DoE  simply  lacks  authority  to  expand  sex  to  mean  gender  identity.    The  DoE  is  an \nadministrative agency created by statute and, as such, only possesses “the authority that Congress \nhas provided.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022).  In issues of “vast \neconomic and political significance,” the Supreme Court has held that Congress must speak clearly \nif “it wishes to assign” such issues to an agency.  Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. E.P.A., 573 U.S. 302, 324 \n(2014).  This is because agencies “have only those powers given to them by Congress, and enabling \nlegislation is generally not an open book to which the agency [may] add pages and change the plot \nline.”  W. Virginia v. Env’t Prot. Agency, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (internal quotations and citation \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 25 of 47\nomitted).  Therefore, if DoE’s regulatory action in formulating the Final Rule “bring[s] about an \nenormous and transformative expansion in [the DoE’s] regulatory authority,” then there must have \nbeen “clear congressional authorization” for those actions.  Util. Air. Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324.  \nHere, Congress did not authorize the DoE to rewrite Title IX or “render any statutory provisions \nmeaningless,” which is the result of the Final Rule.  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *36. \n  In response to Plaintiff’s argument, Defendants merely state that this is not a major \nquestions case and that the DoE “does not contend that Congress gave it the authority to decide as \na matter of policy whether Title IX prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.”  (Doc. 38 \nat 55.)  Rather, Defendants argue that the Final Rule is justified in light of Bostock and that the \nmajor questions doctrine should not be invoked because it was not invoked in Bostock.  Id.  \nDefendants’ argument fails to grasp that the major questions doctrine is applicable to agency action \nthat exceeds its authority.  The major questions doctrine could not have been raised in Bostock \nbecause that case involved a claim of individual discrimination under Title VII; it was not a \nchallenge to agency action.  Therefore, Defendants’ argument is not persuasive and they make no \nattempt to address Plaintiffs’ arguments that this issue is a major question.  Their bedrock position \nthat the Final Rule is justified in light of Bostock carries no weight for the reasons stated herein. \n  The  Final  Rule  clearly  decides  major  questions  involving whether  to  force  schools, \nstudents, and teachers to accept an individual’s subjective gender identity regardless of biological \nsex.  Further, it determines whether biological males who identify as females are allowed in female \nbathrooms and locker rooms.  It further prohibits requiring any medical documentation or other \ndocuments to determine whether those beliefs are sincere and there are no limits on how “many \ntimes a person may change their gender identity.”  Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *13.  The \nFinal Rule is applicable to “every public elementary school, middle school, high school, and \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 26 of 47\ncollege in the United States that receives federal financial assistance.”  Id.  The reach of the Final \nRule is clearly significant.  Further, States are threatened with hundreds of millions, or even \nbillions, of dollars of lost funding if they fail to comply with the Final Rule.  Moreover, States who \nhave conflicting state laws will be required to spend significant sums to make improvements to \nfacilities to comply with the Final Rule and their own laws.  Id. \n  In deciding these questions, DoE has essentially taken it upon itself to answer questions \nthat have prompted significant debate at both the state and federal levels in recent years.  See Texas, \n2024 WL 2947022, at *36 and n.126 (citing authority).  In Congress, several proposals that would \nexpand  “Title  IX’s  anti-discrimination  provisions  to  include  sexual  orientation  and  gender \nidentity” have been repeatedly rejected.  Id. (citing Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, H.R. \n1652, 113th Cong. (2013); Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2015, S. 439, 114th Cong. (2015); \nTitle IX Take Responsibility Act of 2021, H.R. 5396, 117th Cong. (2021); Equality Act, H.R. 5, \n117th Cong. § 9(2) (2021)).  Further, the Final Rule represents an enormous invasion into the \nsphere of education, which has traditionally been an area where States have been sovereign.  \nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 564 (1995). \n  In sum, the court finds that the Final Rule involves issues of both vast economic and \npolitical significance and therefore involves a major question.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, \n*14; Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *14; Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *40.  As such, Congress \nmust have given the agency “clear statutory authorization” to promulgate such a Final Rule.  W. \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 723.  The court finds that Congress did not give such clear statutory \nauthorization to the DoE.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, *14–15; Tennessee, 2024 WL \n3019146, at *14; Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *40.  Therefore, Defendants do not have authority \nto expand the meaning of “sex discrimination” to include gender identity. \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 27 of 47\niii.  Spending Clause \n  The above analysis is sufficient to show a likelihood of success on the merits as to some of \nPlaintiff’s claims.  But the court further notes Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule violates the \nConstitution’s Spending Clause.  Title IX was enacted pursuant to Congress’s authority under the \nSpending Clause, which marks another substantial distinguishing feature between this case and \nBostock.  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U.S. 167, 181 (2005).  Under Spending Clause \njurisprudence, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds . . . [but] [s]uch \nconditions must (among other requirements) bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \nspending[.]”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992).  If Congress desires “to impose \na condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously,” so that the States may \n“exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  Legislation that conditions the receipt \nof federal moneys must (1) be in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) impose unambiguous \nconditions; (3) such conditions must relate to federal interests in the program; and (4) not induce \nunconstitutional action.  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207–08 (1987).  Here, Plaintiffs \nargue that the last three requirements are not met here because Title IX did not impose a condition \nregarding gender identity discrimination, the Final Rule is contrary to federal interests, and it will \nviolate the First Amendment.  (Doc. 25 at 52–56.)  The court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to \nprevail on this claim in that Title IX did not unambiguously condition funds on the prohibition of \ngender identity discrimination and the Final Rule results in First Amendment constraints.  As such, \nthe court declines to address the argument that the Final Rule is contrary to federal interests. \n  Based  on  this  court’s  extensive  discussion  herein,  at  the  time  of  enactment,  sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX meant discrimination based on biological sex.  Title IX did not \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 28 of 47\nprohibit discrimination based on gender identity.  Defendants’ arguments relating to Bostock are \nnot persuasive for the reasons discussed.  Defendants further contend that an  express statement \ncovering gender identity is not required and cite to Jackson in support.  (Doc. 38 at 52–53.)  In \nJackson, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that Title IX did not encompass retaliation \nbecause the defendant was not on notice that it could be liable for retaliating against those who \ncomplain of Title IX violations.  544 U.S. at 182.  While holding as much, the Court made clear \nthat the Board was on notice because Title IX’s private cause of action broadly encompasses \n“diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination,” such as retaliation and sexual harassment.  Id. \nat 183.  The Court further explained the regulations prohibiting retaliation had “been on the books \nfor nearly 30 years” and the courts had already interpreted Title IX to cover retaliation.  Id. \n  In contrast, this case involves agency action in which the Final Rule expands the definition \nof sex discrimination.  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, *15.  Further, DoE has not had regulations \nregarding gender identity discrimination on the books for several years and, just a few short years \nago, took a position contrary to the one being advanced today.  Therefore, a “clear statement from \nCongress equating ‘sex’ to ‘gender identity’ or ‘transgender status is necessary before States’ \nacceptance of federal funds may be conditioned on such a term.”  Id.  Title IX does not provide \nsuch a statement.  The Plaintiff States here did not knowingly and voluntarily agree to ignore the \n“differences between biological sex and gender identity in exchange for federal funds under Title \nIX.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *41.  Nor did they “agree to abolish sex-specific bathrooms, \nlocker rooms, room assignments, and sports in exchange for Title IX’s funds.”  Id. (citing Adams, \n57 F.4th at 816 (“The notion that the School Board could or should have been on notice that its \npolicy of separating male and female bathrooms violates Title IX and its precepts is untenable.”)).  \nIn sum, Title IX falls short of providing notice to the Plaintiff States that “sex discrimination \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 29 of 47\nincludes gender identity.”  Id. at *42.  Therefore, the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause \nbecause it introduces conditions for spending that were not unambiguously clear in Title IX.  \nFurther, based on the discussion infra, the Final Rule violates the Spending Clause because it \nviolates’ students First Amendment rights.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *16. \n  The court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Final Rule \nviolates the Spending Clause.  See id.; Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, *15.   \niv. First Amendment \n  K.R. and the Plaintiff Organizations assert that the Final Rule violates the First Amendment \nrights of individuals by compelling speech that aligns with Defendants’ ideology, censoring speech \nthrough content-based restrictions and viewpoint discrimination, chilling speech through vague \nand overbroad language, and forcing individuals to engage in speech that violates their sincerely \nheld beliefs.  (Doc. 25 at 40.)  The court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the Final Rule violates \nthe First Amendment by chilling speech through vague and overbroad language.  See Tennessee, \n2024 WL 3019146, at *24 (ruling that the Final Rule was vague and overbroad.)  Given this ruling, \nthe court declines to address all of Plaintiffs’ arguments at this stage. \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  Final  Rule  violates  their  constitutional  rights  because  it  is \nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad resulting in chilled speech.  Chilled speech is different \nfrom the suppression of speech; it is self-imposed but nonetheless violates the First Amendment.  \nSee Speech First, Inc. v. Sands, 144 S. Ct. 675, 676 (2024) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Bantam \nBooks, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 67 (1963) (discussing that “self-censorship” violates the “First \nAmendment just as acutely as a direct bar on speech”)).  The First Amendment’s Free Speech \nClause prohibits government entities and actors from “abridging the freedom of speech.”  Nat’l \nRifle Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 144 S. Ct. 1316, 1326 (2024).  When a vague law “abut(s) upon \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 30 of 47\nsensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of (those) \nfreedoms.  Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . \nthan if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.”  Grayned v. City of Rockford, \n408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  A regulation is also \nimpermissibly vague if it “fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity \nto understand what conduct it prohibits,” or “if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement.”  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (citing Chicago v. \nMorales, 527 U.S. 41, 56–57 (1999)). \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule’s sexual harassment definition will chill students who \nwant to articulate that sex is immutable and binary, explain their beliefs as to the differences \nbetween men and women, refer to individuals with biologically accurate pronouns, and speak in \nopposition to sharing bathrooms and other intimate spaces with individuals who do not share their \nbiological sex.5  (Doc. 25 at 26–30, 44–46.)  They assert that the term “gender identity” is vague \nas it is not defined but is explained in the preamble to the Final Rule to be an individual’s subjective \nsense of their gender.  (Id. at 44) (quoting 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809.)  Further, the term sex stereotypes \nis defined as any asserted differences between males and females.  Moreover, and relevant to this \nparticular  aspect  of  Plaintiffs’  claim,  the  standard  for  harassment  has  changed  and  now \nencompasses gender identity discrimination such that students are concerned that any speech that \nsex is immutable would risk a harassment claim.  Plaintiffs’ concerns were shared by the general \npublic as evidenced in the preamble.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809. \n \n5 Plaintiffs also argue that there is a chilling effect for students who wish to speak in opposition of allowing biological \nmales to compete in women’s sports, but the court does not consider this argument in its analysis due to the Final \nRule’s carveout for athletics. \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 31 of 47\nWith respect to the concerns that the term “gender identity” was impermissibly vague, the \nDepartment disagreed but offered no further guidance.  Rather, the Department stated that this \n“term of vital importance can be subjectively defined by each and every individual based entirely \nupon his or her own internal sense of self.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *24.  Further, \nalthough a student may not know “another’s gender identity,” the Department stated that gender \nidentity discrimination remains sex discrimination.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,809. \nTurning to the sex-based harassment standard, hostile environment harassment is defined \nas “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively \nand objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to \nparticipate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile \nenvironment)”  Id. at 33,884 (amending 34 C.F.R. § 106.2).  This definition is vague and also \noverbroad because it is entirely fact dependent and there is no guidance as to how a recipient is to \ndetermine what constitutes hostile environment harassment.  Again, commenters raised these same \nconcerns to the Department.  This is concerning given the Department’s position on the issues of \ngender identity and misgendering.  As pointed out by Plaintiffs, the preamble makes clear that the \nDepartment views misgendering as potentially sex-based harassment.  The Department states that \na “stray remark, such as a misuse of language, would not constitute harassment,” but otherwise \nfails to identify what objectively constitutes harassment and under whose standard is it measured.  \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,516.  Rather, the Department merely kept parroting the definition in support of \nits position that the standard is not vague or overbroad.  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *26 \n(“Not only did the Department fail to meaningfully address these First Amendment concerns, but \nit also intentionally opted to leave the vague terms undefined.”)  This is concerning because the \n“objective standard” is “inherently not objective at all because the Final Rule imposes a viewpoint \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 32 of 47\nconsistent with the affirmation of gender identity.  So, in the context of misgendering, the offensive \nconduct must be ‘subjectively offensive’ and ‘objectively offensive’ as viewed through the lens of \nsomeone who recognizes sex and gender to be separate and distinct.”  Id. at *25 (quotations and \ncitations omitted). \nNotably, during the hearing, the court asked the DoE’s counsel whether students could \nengage in a civil discourse regarding the issue of gender identity without being fearful of an \naccusation of sex-based harassment.  Specifically, the court asked defense counsel if a student \nwere to state that she believes that sex and gender are the same, they are immutable, and/or that a \nperson’s gender identity cannot deviate from his or her biological sex, would that person be \nsubjected to an actionable discrimination complaint under the Final Rule?  Defense counsel could \nnot definitively answer the question and continued to state that it would depend on the facts and \nspecific circumstances.  Counsel then stated that the complainant would also have to show that \nsuch speech limited or denied a person's ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s \neducation program or activity.  What does it mean to limit a person’s ability to participate in an \neducation program?  Those terms are not defined in the Final Rule and, as discussed at the hearing, \nthe term “program or activity” as defined by Title IX means all operations of a school.6  See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1687.  Therefore, this standard for actionable discrimination under the Final Rule could \nconceivably be met in any circumstance where a student simply complained that he could not \nconcentrate in class due to another student’s statements on the topic of gender identity.  This \ninterpretation is supported by the Department’s statement that the student need not demonstrate a \n \n6 Indeed, as all counsel agreed at the hearing, the statutory definition of “program or activity” reaches every aspect of \nevery part of every state and local government in the entire nation if any part thereof receives federal financial \nassistance.  See 20 U.S.C. 1687(1)(A).  And since pretty much every state and local government receives some federal \nfunding of one kind or another, the practical application of this statute is to sweep in every aspect of every state and \nlocal government in the country.  The astonishing sweep of that language only gets pared down when section 1681 of \ntitle 20 limits the prohibitions against sex-based discrimination to any “education program or activity.” \n \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 33 of 47\nparticular harm just “some impact on their ability to participate or benefit from the education \nprogram . . . .”  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511.  Therefore, contrary to defense counsel’s argument that \nthis language imposes some limit on the scope of a harassment claim, it does not; rather, it is an \nentirely subjective standard that is potentially met whenever the complainant alleges that the \nconduct or speech somehow impacts the complainant’s education.  And there is no objective \nstandard to measure whether the complainant was actually impacted because there is no need to \ndemonstrate harm. \nIn sum, the court finds that this standard is impermissibly vague and overbroad.  Tennessee, \n2024 WL 3019146, at *27.  There was not one lawyer in the courtroom, including the undersigned, \nwho was able to offer any possible explanation of what a parent should tell their child about the \nlimits of legal speech at their schools on the topic of gender identity or sexual orientation under \nthe Final Rule.  The result is that speech is chilled because what student wants to “run the risk of \nbeing accused of” sex-based harassment and subjected to an investigation and potential discipline.  \nSpeech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, 32 F.4th 1110, 1124 (11th Cir. 2022). \nv.  Arbitrary and Capricious \n  Finally,  the  court  finds  in  the  alternative  that  the  Department  acted  arbitrarily  and \ncapriciously when promulgating the Final Rule.  Even if the agency had the authority to alter the \nTitle IX standard in this manner, the court must set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]”  5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A).  \nAn agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors \nwhich Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or if the agency action is so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise. \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 34 of 47\n \nDiné Citizens Against Ruining Our Env’t v. Haaland, 59 F.4th 1016, 1029 (10th Cir. 2023) \n(quoting Wyoming, U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 661 F.3d 1209, 1227 (10th Cir. 2011)). \n  Plaintiffs assert that they will succeed on this claim because the DoE’s explanation for the \nFinal Rule is implausible and the Final Rule is a sharp departure from past practice without \nreasonable explanation.  With respect to their first argument, Plaintiffs contend that the agency \naction is implausible because the Final Rule inflicts harm on those it was meant to protect and \nelevates transgender individuals’ interests.  Essentially, Plaintiffs argue that the agency failed to \nconsider and give weight to harm to females who will have to share intimate spaces with biological \nmales.  In response to this argument, Defendants argue that the DoE’s reasoning flows from \ncarefully considering the structure and text of Title IX.  (Doc. 38 at 25.)  The DoE asserts it fully \nconsidered and addressed privacy concerns and determined that there was a lack of evidence that \ntransgender students posed a risk to non-transgender students in a single-sex space and asserted \nthat such generalized concerns have been unsubstantiated.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,820.  The DoE \ndetermined that not allowing a biological male who identifies as a female to use the girls’ locker \nroom amounts to gender identity discrimination and always results in more than de minimis harm.  \nBy contrast, the agency concludes that a biological female is not harmed by having to share a \nlocker room and shower with a biological male because her privacy concerns are not substantiated. \n  During  oral  argument,  the  court  noted  that  such  treatment  elevates  gender  identity \ndiscrimination over the traditional view of biological sex discrimination that Title IX was intended \nto address.  The DoE has determined that the harm to the transgender student is more than the harm \nto the biological female.  In fact, according to the DoE, biological females are not harmed by \nhaving to share a bathroom and shower with biological males.  Such a conclusion is not supported \nby the evidence in this case.  Notably, K.R.’s affidavit states that she avoided using school \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 35 of 47\nrestrooms and that biological males who do not even identify as females went into the female \nrestroom because they knew that they would get away with it and wanted to go into the female \nrestroom with the girls.  (Doc. 25-3 at 3.)  Such fears by students, therefore, come from real and \njustified concerns.   \nFurther,  the  DoE  was  faced  with  numerous  comments  in  which  similar  fears  about \nlegitimate harms were expressed.  The State of Tennessee offered evidence of “numerous instances \nof males attacking females in public restrooms that were designated for females only.”  Tennessee, \n2024 WL 3019146 at *35 (citing to the administrative record).  This comment by Tennessee was \nnot addressed at all in the preamble.  Further, the DoE’s position ignores the fact that the biological \nsexes have long had separate spaces to use the restroom and shower and that this is based on a \n“significant privacy interest in [one’s] unclothed” body.  Id. (quoting Brannum v. Overton Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494, 496 (6th Cir. 2008) and citing Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, \n1030 (11th Cir. 1993) (“most people have ‘a special sense of privacy in their genitals, and \ninvoluntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be especially \ndemeaning and humiliating.’”); Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 626 (1989) \n(“[E]xecretory function[s are] traditionally shielded by great privacy.”); Grimm, 972 F.3d at 633 \n(Neimeyer, J., dissenting) (discussing that “courts have long recognized” an individual’s bodily \nprivacy interests are “significantly heightened when persons of the opposite biological sex are \npresent.”) (collecting cases).  That privacy interest was recognized by Congress as evidenced in \nthe congressional record and as set forth in Title IX.  Further, the Supreme Court recognized that \nintegrating an all-male military institution “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to \nafford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.”  United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996).   \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 36 of 47\nIn response to the court’s questions about biological females’ fears and safety concerns, \nespecially in light of K.R.’s affidavit, defense counsel stated that the school should have policies \nin place to protect the student from transgender biological males using restrooms and locker rooms \nand that other States that require transgender students have access to the restrooms and locker \nrooms of their choice have not had privacy and safety concerns.  Further, counsel stated that a \nbiological  female  who  feels  unsafe  using  the  locker  room  or  restroom  could  ask  for  an \naccommodation such as using the staff restrooms.  According to the DoE, such accommodation, \nhowever, is clearly not acceptable as a response to a transgender student.  Rather, that student is \nto use the restroom or shower facilities that align with the student’s gender identity.  Moreover, \nthe school cannot seek documentation or otherwise attempt to confirm the student’s gender identity \nwith a medical provider.  Defense counsel asserts that the recipient can put in place policies to \nverify gender identity, and the recipient can seek verification from a parent or coach.  The preamble \nmerely  discusses  that  the  DoE  is  aware  that  some  schools  rely  on  the  student,  or  written \nconfirmation from a parent, a coach, or a teacher.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,819.  However, this was \nmerely an observation of current practices, not the DoE’s blessing on such practices.  In the next \nsentence, the DoE clearly states that requiring a student to submit to “burdensome documentation \nrequirements. . . imposes more than de minimis harm.”  Id.  The DoE does not explicitly authorize \nany policy to determine a student’s gender identity apart from said student’s own statement and, \nin fact, dissuades a recipient from any documentation requirements, which could include a letter \nfrom a parent or coach.  Given that and the evidence before the court, it is not hard to imagine that, \nunder the Final Rule, an industrious older teenage boy may simply claim to identify as a female to \ngain access to the girls’ showers, dressing rooms, or locker rooms so that he can observe his female \npeers disrobe and shower.  Under the Final Rule, the recipients would appear to be obliged to \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 37 of 47\naccept this young man’s assertions and give him unfettered access to those female facilities, or \nelse risk running afoul of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Final Rule.  “Allowing a \nbiological male student to change to a female by simply declaring it, requiring no documentation \nof the change, and allowing the student to shower with [biological] females in the girls’ locker \nroom goes beyond the scope of arbitrary and capricious.”  Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *19.  \n“As the Department would have it, sex means sex except when gender identity comes until play.  \nNot only is this an illogical distinction forbidden by Title IX’s exclusions, but it would also \nconstitute the very type of sex discrimination Title IX prohibits by privileging transgender persons \nwith the ability to abide by their biological sex or not in order to take advantage of preferred \nbenefits or services.”  Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *38.   Therefore, the Final Rule’s explanation \nfor its actions is implausible under the arbitrary and capricious standard.  Moreover, it is clear that \nthe DoE failed to consider several important aspects of the problems raised by the Final Rule. \nThe Final Rule is also a sharp departure from past practice without reasonable explanation.  \nThe DoE claims that this rule is merely a clarification.  However, just two short years before the \nproposed rule was issued, the DoE stated that Title IX did not cover gender identity discrimination.  \nFurther, the Final Rule’s attempt to reason the exceptions in section 106.31(a)(2) rings hollow.  \nThe DoE claims that a recipient may engage in sex discrimination, including gender identity \ndiscrimination, if it is done in accordance with a statutory exception or the athletics regulation.  \nDoE’s justification for allowing gender identity discrimination to continue in athletics is because \nof the unique considerations that athletics presents and its new proposed regulation which is not at \nissue here.  89 Fed. Reg. at 33,839.  However, the regulation regarding sex separation in restrooms \nand locker rooms has been in effect just as long as the athletics regulation.  And just as Congress \nwas concerned about equal treatment in athletics, it was also concerned about privacy for students.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 38 of 47\nTherefore, the DoE has failed to adequately explain the reason for allowing continued sex \nseparation in athletics but not in restrooms and locker rooms. \nThe court further finds that the DoE failed to adequately consider several relevant factors \nwhen drafting the Final Rule.  The DoE failed to include requirements for a change in gender \nidentity, failed to consider harms to non-transgender students, and failed to sufficiently explain \nhow the harm to transgender students is outweighed by the harm to non-transgender students with \nrespect to the use of restrooms and locker rooms.  See Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, *19.  \nIn sum, the court finds that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it offers an \nimplausible explanation for agency action, is a sharp departure from prior action without a \nreasonable explanation, and failed to consider important interests as discussed herein.  \nvi. Conclusion \n  In sum, the court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims that the Final Rule \nis contrary to law and exceeds statutory authority, the Final Rule is an unconstitutional exercise of \nlegislative power under the Spending Clause, the Final Rule violates the First Amendment, and \nthe Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  In light of the decision herein and the relief available as \ndiscussed below, the court declines to address all of Plaintiffs’ claims and arguments pertaining to \nother laws and provisions of the Final Rule. \nC.  Preliminary Injunction Element 2: Irreparable Injury \nThe court finds that Plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury if the Final Rule goes into \neffect on August 1.  Based on the declarations, Plaintiff States will incur costs that cannot be \nrecouped including costs to update policies, materials, and hiring additional Title IX staff.  Further, \nStates are required to comply with the Final Rule in a short period of time.  “Plaintiffs have \nsufficiently demonstrated that the compliance costs here are extraordinary due to the sweeping \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 39 of 47\npolicy changes they are required to implement and the short timeframe in which they must do so.  \nAnd because the recovery of these costs would necessarily be barred, this factor weighs in favor \nof a finding of irreparable harm.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *39 (citing Thunder Basin \nCoal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (“[C]omplying with \na regulation later held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable \ncompliance costs.”)).  Further, private Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm with respect to the \nviolation of First Amendment rights.  Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *19.  “The loss of First \nAmendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). \nD.  Preliminary Injunction Elements 3 and 4: Balance of Harms and Public Interest \nThe final two factors involve balancing the harms to each party and the public interest.  The \nTenth Circuit has held that when a law “is likely unconstitutional,” the government’s interests do \n“not outweigh a plaintiff’s interest in having [his or her] constitutional rights protected.”  Hobby \nLobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1145 (10th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted), aff'd sub nom. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682 (2014).  Further \nit is always in the public interest to “prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”  Id. \nMoreover, the regulations that are currently in effect have essentially “been unchanged for \napproximately 50 years.  Therefore, it would be of relatively little harm to others to maintain the \nstatus quo pending the resolution of this lawsuit.”  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, *42.  The court \nfinds that these factors weigh in favor of Plaintiffs. \nE.  Scope \nPlaintiffs seek to stay the Final Rule in its entirety and also ask the court for a nationwide \npreliminary injunction.  In response, Defendants ask the court to allow some parts of the Final \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 40 of 47\nRule to go forward and to limit any injunctive relief to the Plaintiff States and K.R.’s school.  \nDefendants point to the severability clause contained in each subsection in the current regulations \nwhich provides: “If any provision of this subpart or its application to any person, act, or practice \nis held invalid, the remainder of the subpart or the application of its provisions to any person, act, \nor practice shall not be affected thereby.” 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.9; 106.18; 106.48; see also 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,848. \nAlthough the court did not explicitly address all of the provisions in the Final Rule, the \ncourt finds that § 106.10, the new definition of sex discrimination, is unlawful for the reasons \nstated herein.  That impermissible definition permeates the entire rule and, as such, it is difficult \nto excise the remaining regulations without also eliminating those regulations that involve sex \ndiscrimination.  Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *43.  Further, Plaintiffs will likely prevail on \ntheir claim that the DoE’s rulemaking was arbitrary and capricious.  Therefore, the Final Rule \nwould be invalid in its entirety.  Id.  The court also declines to parse out the sections that may \nremain as “rulemaking is exclusively within the purview of the Executive Branch.”  Id. (citing \nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 330 (2006) (asking whether the \nlegislature would have “preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all”). \n  Finally, Plaintiffs seek a nationwide injunction7 so that all parties may be provided relief.  \nDefendants object to a nationwide injunction asserting that the relief should be limited to the \nPlaintiff States.  Plaintiffs argue that universal relief is appropriate here because of the Plaintiff \nOrganizations.  In response, Defendants assert that it is not appropriate because the affidavits \nsubmitted are mostly limited to individuals in the plaintiff States.  (Doc. 47.)  Defendants \n \n7 As noted by Judge Crabtree recently, the “proper terminology for this request is unsettled.”  Alaska v. United States \nDep't of Educ., No. 24-1057-DDC-ADM, 2024 WL 3104578, at *17 (D. Kan. June 24, 2024) (discussing that courts \nhave used both nationwide and universal in seeking such relief).   \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 41 of 47\npainstakingly review all of the declarations and the physical locations of the declarants in their \nsupplemental brief to support their position that relief should be limited to the Plaintiff States and \nK.R.’s school even though some affidavits are from individuals in other States.  But Defendants \nfail  to  cite  any  authority  that  injunctive  relief  should  be  so  limited  in  light  of  Plaintiff \nOrganizations’ standing to bring this suit.  As such, they can seek relief on behalf of all their \nmembers.    An  injunction  limiting  relief  to  Plaintiff  States  would  not  provide  the  Plaintiff \nOrganizations complete relief. \nThe court recognizes that nationwide injunctions are the “subject of much debate.”  Alaska, \n2024 WL 3104578, at *17, n.11.  Both courts that have granted similar relief have limited that \nrelief to the plaintiff States involved in those cases.  See Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *43; \nLouisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *20.  In Louisiana, the Plaintiffs included several school districts \nin Louisiana, and the States of Louisiana, Montana, Mississippi, and Idaho.  2024 WL 2978786, \nat *2, n.13.  The Plaintiffs in Tennessee included Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, \nand West Virginia.  2024 WL 3019146, at *6.  Those actions did not include private plaintiffs and \nare thus distinguishable. \n  Under section 705 of the APA a reviewing court is to “issue all necessary and appropriate \nprocess to postpone the effective date of an agency action” that is under review.  5 U.S.C. § 705.  \n“Traditionally, when a federal court finds a remedy merited, it provides party-specific relief, \ndirecting the defendant to take or not take some action relative to the plaintiff.”  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 693 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (citing Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 \nU. S. 922, 931 (1975) (“[N]either declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with the \nenforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal \nplaintiffs.”)  Nationwide injunctions are a “relatively new phenomenon” and a phenomenon which \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 42 of 47\nthe Supreme Court has yet to fully address.  See Labrador v. Poe by & through Poe, 144 S. Ct. \n921, 926 (2024) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (discussing that “the propriety of universal injunctive \nrelief [is] a question of great significance that has been in need of the Court's attention for some \ntime.”)  Problems with nationwide injunctions include depriving other courts of the opportunity to \nweigh in on these important questions, encouraging forum shopping, and circumventing rules \ngoverning  class-wide  relief.    Texas,  599  U.S.  at  694  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring).    Issuing  a \nnationwide injunction in this case would result in the court ordering Defendants to stop the Final \nRule from taking effect for everyone, including States which clearly do not want such relief as \nevidenced in the amicus brief.  As discussed, this issue is currently being litigated in several \ndistricts and a nationwide injunction may result in one or more of those courts concluding that the \nplaintiffs can no longer show an irreparable injury in light of a decision granting universal relief. \nBoth courts in Tennessee and Louisiana refrained from issuing nationwide injunctions at least in \npart because of the ongoing litigation in other courts.  Given the above, the court remains \ncircumspect about the propriety of a nationwide injunction in this case. \nIn formulating a preliminary injunction, the court is to exercise its discretion and judgment \nin light of the “equities of a given case [and] the substance of the legal issues it presents.” Trump \nv. Int'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579–80 (2017).  The “court need not grant the \ntotal relief sought by the applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular \ncase.”  Id. at 580 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court instructs \nthat “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide \ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) \n(quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)).   \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 43 of 47\n    Here, Plaintiffs include organizations with members all over the country.  Therefore, to \nprovide complete relief to all parties, the court must enjoin the Final Rule from going into effect \nagainst Plaintiffs and their members given the rulings herein.  At this time, there is no evidence \nbefore the court that enjoining the Final Rule from being applied to the members of the Plaintiff \nOrganizations would be unduly burdensome to Defendants as opposed to providing a nationwide \nor universal injunction. \n  Instead, the court determines that the better path is to abide by the traditional approach and \nlimit preliminary injunctive relief to the parties, including the members of Plaintiff Organizations.  \nThat leaves it to Defendants, in the first instance, to determine whether patchwork enforcement of \nthe Final Rule is feasible and worth the risk of running afoul of the court’s injunction, thereby \nexposing Defendants and their representatives to sanctions for contempt.  This seems to align with \nthe APA’s admonition that, “[w]hen an agency finds that justice so requires, it may postpone the \neffective date of action taken by it, pending judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  That is the first \nsentence in section 705.  It is only the second sentence of that section that empowers a reviewing \ncourt, “[o]n such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable \ninjury,” to “issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency \naction or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.”  Id.  That \nsequencing of the statutory language suggests that the better approach is to allow the agency to \nevaluate the court’s ruling and the scope of relief provided in order to determine whether a \nvoluntary stay of the entire rule should be rendered until judicial review is completed.  The agency \nis in a far better position than the court to evaluate the practicalities and feasibility of continued \nenforcement of the rule in light of relief afforded to date.  In this case, that means that Defendants \ncan evaluate the cumulative effect of relief provided by this court, along with relief provided in \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 44 of 47\nother courts, both prior to and after this order is entered, in making a decision as to whether to stay \nthe effective date of the Final Rule pending completion of judicial review.   \nAdditionally, the court’s decision is influenced by the Tenth Circuit’s admonition that \ncertain  injunctions  are  disfavored  and  require  heightened  scrutiny,  including  “preliminary \ninjunctions that afford the movant all the relief that it could recover at the conclusion of a full trial \non the merits.”  Fish, 840 F.3d at 723–24.  Under the APA, courts are ultimately authorized to set \naside unlawful agency action, a remedy referred to as vacatur.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  “[V]acatur \nis universal in scope because an unlawful regulation cannot be vacated as to only one party.”  Texas \nv. Cardona, No. 4:23-CV-00604-O, 2024 WL 2947022, at *47 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2024) (citing \nCareer Colls. & Schs. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep't of Educ., et al., 98 F.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024)).  But \nthat case was decided at summary judgment, not on a motion for preliminary injunction.  See id.  \nat *1.  And while the Fifth Circuit case relied on for that proposition held that vacatur was \nappropriate even at the preliminary injunction phase, that conclusion remains the subject of \nsubstantial debate.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 395–96 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J., \nconcurring).  Granting a nationwide injunction in this case would effectively give Plaintiffs all the \nrelief they might ultimately hope to obtain at the completion of this litigation – a decision better \nmade with a fully developed record.  Suffice it to say that this court can fashion appropriate \npreliminary relief for Plaintiffs without resort to universal injunctions, leaving it to Defendants to \ndetermine in the first instance whether continued enforcement in compliance with this decision is \nworth the effort.  See, e.g., Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National \nInjunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 476–79 (2017). \n  As for Plaintiff States, the court can enjoin implementation and enforcement of the Final \nRule with respect to the States, including any education programs or activities within those States.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 45 of 47\nTurning to Plaintiff K.R., the court observes that counsel for Defendants conceded at oral argument \nthat relief for K.R. should be imposed at the level of her school.  The court agrees.  By way of \nexample, given that the flash points of this dispute involve matters such as how to segregate and \nrestrict access to intimate spaces such as bathrooms, dressing rooms, and showers, it would be \nimpossible to limit relief to K.R., yet allow Defendants to demand compliance with the Final Rule \nas to everyone else who uses those facilities at her school.  Accordingly, relief for K.R. is \nappropriately provided by enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing the Final Rule at \nher school.  As for the Plaintiff Organizations, given their standing to seek relief on behalf of their \nmembers, the appropriate scope of relief there is, similar to the relief provided for K.R., to enjoin \nimplementation and enforcement of the Final Rule at any school attended by a member of Young \nAmerica’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as any school attended by a minor child \nof a member of Moms for Liberty. \n  While the scope of this relief is broad, it follows the traditional approach of limiting \ninjunctive relief to the parties to this litigation.  Moreover, there is no obvious reason to limit the \nrelief sought by Plaintiff Organizations to the geographic limits of the co-plaintiff States.  The \nPlaintiff Organizations demonstrated standing in their own right; thus, they could have brought \nthis suit on their own without joining with Plaintiff States.  Accordingly, it makes no sense to \npenalize Plaintiff Organizations by circumscribing the scope of relief to which they are otherwise \nentitled by limiting it to the States represented by their co-plaintiffs.  To rule otherwise would risk \nrendering the participation of the Plaintiff Organizations a legal nullity because they would have \nobtained the same relief through the participation of Plaintiff States.  \n  Finally, nothing in this order limits the ability of any school to adopt or follow its own \npolicies, or otherwise comply with applicable state or local laws or rules regarding the subjects \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 46 of 47\naddressed herein.  Rather, it simply prohibits Defendants from demanding compliance with the \nFinal Rule by the schools affected by this order, or imposing any consequences for such schools’ \nfailure to comply with the Final Rule.   \n  Accordingly, Defendants are enjoined from implementing or taking any action to enforce \nthe Final Rule against Plaintiff States, K.R.’s school, the schools attended by the members of \nYoung America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as any school attended by a \nminor child of a member of Moms for Liberty.  In order to effectuate this preliminary injunction, \nPlaintiff Organizations are directed to file a notice in the record identifying the schools which the \nmembers of Young America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United attend, as well as the schools \nattended by the minor children of the members of Moms for Liberty, on or before July 15, 2024.  \nThis filing should not identify members of those organizations or the children of any such \nmembers.  Rather, it should provide notice to Defendants of the schools as to which this order \nenjoins enforcement of the Final Rule.  Should Defendants conclude that they need to know the \nnames of members or their children, Defendants can seek that information through discovery and \nthe court can evaluate the propriety of any such requests and the need for protective orders or \nsimilar tools surrounding disclosure of such information, all in a more concrete context.  \nF.  Bond \nUnder Rule 65(c), the court may issue an injunction “only if” the moving party provides \nsecurity sufficient to cover damages sustained by the enjoined party if that enjoined party were \nwrongly enjoined.  Private Plaintiffs ask the court to waive the bond requirement.  (Doc. 43 at 35 \nn.9.)  In the Tenth Circuit, district courts have “wide discretion” in determining “whether to require \nsecurity.” Winnebago  Tribe  of  Nebraska  v.  Stovall,  341  F.3d  1202,  1206  (10th  Cir.  2003) \n46 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 53   Filed 07/02/24   Page 47 of 47\n(emphasis added).  Where there is “an absence of proof showing a likelihood of harm” to the \nenjoined party, failing to require a bond is permissible.  See id. \nHere, the court finds that no security is necessary in this case due to the strength of \nPlaintiffs’ case and the public interest.  Moreover, the current regulations continue to be in effect \nwhich support a finding that the injunction will not harm Defendants. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 24) is GRANTED.   \nAccordingly, it is hereby ordered that the United States Department of Education, Miguel \nCardona, Secretary of U.S. Dept. of Education, the United States Department of Justice, Merrick \nGarland,  Attorney  General  of  the  United  States,  and  all  their  respective  officers,  agents, \nemployees, attorneys, and persons acting in concert or participation with them are ENJOINED \nfrom  implementing,  enacting,  enforcing,  or  taking  any  action  to  enforce  the  Final  Rule \npromulgated by the Department of Education titled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance” and published in the \nFederal Register at 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474, set to become effective on August 1, 2024, against \nKansas, Alaska, Utah, Wyoming, K.R.’s school, the schools attended by the members of Young \nAmerica’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as the schools attended by the children \nof the members of Moms for Liberty.  Plaintiff Organizations are directed to file a notice in the \nrecord identifying the schools which their members or their members’ children, as applicable, \nattend on or before July 15, 2024.8  IT IS SO ORDERED.

Case No.  24-4041-JWB \n \n       \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, et al., \n     \n  Defendants.   \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n \n  This matter is before the court on Defendants’ motion for a partial stay pending appeal \n(Doc. 59) and Plaintiff Moms for Liberty’s motion to revise stay (Doc. 62).  The motions have \nbeen fully briefed and are ripe for decision.  (Docs. 63, 64, 65.)  The motions are DENIED FOR \nLACK OF JURISDICTION for the reasons stated herein. \nI.  Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant United States Department of Education \n(“DoE”) and other federal Defendants on May 14, 2024.  (Doc. 1.)  Plaintiffs include the States of \nKansas,  Alaska,  Utah,  and  Wyoming.    Plaintiffs  also  include  K.R.,  a  minor,  and  three \norganizations: Moms for Liberty, Young America’s Foundation, and Female Athletes United (the \n“Plaintiff Organizations”).  Plaintiffs’ complaint challenges the Final Rule issued on April 29, \n2024— Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33474, 33477 (Apr. 29, 2024).  In their complaint, \nPlaintiffs allege that the Final Rule is contrary to law, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, arbitrary \nand capricious, violates separation of powers principles, violates the Spending Clause, and violates \nthe First Amendment.  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment holding the Final Rule unlawful and \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 2 of 8\nother related declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs also seek a preliminary and permanent injunction \nprohibiting Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule, as well as a stay of the Final Rule’s effective \ndate.  On May 24, Plaintiffs filed their motion for a stay/preliminary injunction.  (Doc. 24.)  The \ncourt held a hearing on the motion on June 20, 2024.  On July 2, the court issued an order granting \nPlaintiffs’ motion.  (Doc. 53.) \nAs discussed more thoroughly in the court’s memorandum and order, the court held that \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on a number of claims due to the Final Rule being contrary to \nseveral laws.  Significantly, the Final Rule redefines sex discrimination under Title IX such that it \nconflicts with the plain language of Title IX.  According to the Final Rule, sex discrimination \nincludes discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation, sex stereotypes, and sex \ncharacteristics.  This court held that Plaintiffs will likely prevail on their claim that the Final Rule \nis contrary to Title IX and will preempt state law as it requires recipients to allow students access \nto private spaces, such as bathrooms and locker rooms, based on their gender identity.   \nThe Final Rule creates a new standard of de minimis harm and a new definition of sex-\nbased harassment.  As set forth in this court’s order, the definition of hostile environment \nharassment is vague and overbroad.  (Id. at 31.)  The court further found that the DoE acted \narbitrarily and capriciously when promulgating the Final Rule because the DoE offered an \nimplausible explanation for agency action, it is a sharp departure from prior action without a \nreasonable explanation, and the DoE failed to consider important interests as discussed herein.  (Id. \nat 38.) \nThe court also held that Plaintiffs had established immediate and irreparable harm.  Further, \nthe court found that Defendants had not shown that their perceived harm outweighed Plaintiffs’ \nharm and, further, the Title IX regulations have been largely unchanged for decades.  Therefore, \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 3 of 8\nthose regulations could continue during these proceedings.  In granting injunctive relief, the court \nenjoined Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule against the Plaintiff States, K.R.’s school, and \nthe schools attended by the members of the Plaintiff Organizations or their minor children.   \nDefendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal on July 10.  Since filing the appeal, \nDefendants have moved for a partial stay of the preliminary injunction.  Defendants request that \nthe court stay the injunction insofar as it extends beyond the following provisions: “34 C.F.R. § \n106.31(a)(2), and the hostile environment harassment definition in 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 as applied to \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity.”  (Doc. 59 at 2.)  Defendants assert that they are the \nonly provisions that Plaintiffs have shown result in their harm.  Defendants also ask the court to \nlimit the injunction to the members of Plaintiff Organizations on the date of filing or the date the \ninjunction was entered.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion.  Plaintiff Moms for Liberty also moves to \nmodify the preliminary injunction with respect to the reach of the injunction.  Plaintiff Moms for \nLiberty asks the court to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule in any county in which \nthey have a member instead of limiting the relief to the schools attended by the members’ minor \nchildren.  Defendants oppose the motion. \nII.  Analysis \nA.  Jurisdiction \nAs noted herein, Defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal challenging this court’s \ndecision granting Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  Typically, “[t]he filing of a \nnotice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of \nappeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the \nappeal.”  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982).  None of the parties \naddresses whether this court has jurisdiction to grant the relief that they request. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 4 of 8\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d) provides that “[w]hile an appeal is pending from an \ninterlocutory order or final judgment that grants, continues, modifies, refuses, dissolves, or refuses \nto dissolve or modify an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction \non terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party's rights.”  At first glance, it would \nappear that the court could “modify” the preliminary injunction as the parties request.  See State \nof Colo. v. Idarado Min. Co., 916 F.2d 1486, 1490, n. 2 (10th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that Rule 62 \nprovides the district court with authority to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction pending \nappeal).  The Rule, however, “grants the district court no broader power than it has always \ninherently possessed to preserve the status quo during the pendency of an appeal; it does not restore \njurisdiction to the district court to adjudicate anew the merits of the case.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc. v. Sw. Marine Inc., 242 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir. 2001).  Although the Tenth Circuit has not \ndirectly spoken on this issue, other courts in this circuit have agreed that the scope of the rule is \nnarrow; the court may modify the order but only to preserve the status quo.  See United States v. \nPower Eng'g Co., 10 F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1170–71 (D. Colo. 1998); Pueblo of Pojoaque v. State, \n233 F. Supp. 3d 1021, 1091 (D.N.M. 2017).  Other circuits have similarly held that Rule 62(d) is \nnarrow.  See Coastal Corp. v. Texas E. Corp., 869 F.2d 817, 820 (5th Cir. 1989) (holding that \n“once the injunction has been appealed the district court lacks jurisdiction to tamper in any way \nwith the order then on interlocutory appeal other than to issue orders designed to preserve the status \nquo of the case as it sat before the court of appeals.”) (citing Ideal Toy Corp. v. Sayco Doll Corp., \n302 F.2d 623, 625 (2d Cir. 1962); Lewis v. Tobacco Workers' Int'l Union, 577 F.2d 1135 (4th Cir. \n1978)); see also Eli Lilly & Co. v. Arla Foods, Inc., 893 F.3d 375, 384 (7th Cir. 2018) (Rule 62(d) \n“allow[s] the district court to modify an injunction to maintain the status quo pending appeal”)); \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure: Rules and Commentary, Rule 62, at 304 (2021) (“Despite the \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 5 of 8\nopen-ended text of Rule 62(d) it is well established that the trial court's authority under Rule 62(d) \nis limited. The most common construction of Rule 62(d) limits its operation to rulings designed to \npreserve the status quo during the pendency of the appeal.”) \nThe relief sought by Moms for Liberty and Defendants’ requested relief to stay the \ninjunction as to all but two provisions of the Final Rule significantly changes the status quo of this \nmatter.  Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested relief. \nB.  Scope of Injunction \nDefendants  also  ask  the  court  to  limit  the  injunction  to  the  members  of  Plaintiff \nOrganizations on the date of filing or the date the injunction was entered.  Plaintiffs oppose this \nrequest.    Defendants’  requested  relief  can  be  interpreted  as  a  motion  for  clarification  or \nmodification regarding the scope of this court’s order.  In Arla Foods, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat a district court may resolve technical objections or clarify wording in the injunction and that \nsuch a ruling would aid in the appeal.  893 F.3d at 384 (citing Dixon v. Edwards, 290 F.3d 699, \n709 n.14 (4th Cir. 2002).  Because the court’s order did not specifically identify whether it applied \nto prospective members of the Plaintiff Organizations and it would aid the Tenth Circuit on appeal \nfor this court to clarify its ruling, the court finds that it has jurisdiction to address this issue.  \nFurther, the court notes that it is proper to clarify this issue because due process favors ensuring \nthat Defendants are on notice as to what activity is covered by the scope of the injunction.  That \nwas the reason the court ordered the Plaintiff Organizations to provide the list of schools to the \ncourt in the first place—so that Defendants are put on notice of those schools and can avoid the \nrisk of non-compliance with the injunction. \nIn their motion, Defendants do not argue that this court erred in finding that the Plaintiff \nOrganizations had standing to assert claims on behalf of their members.  In its decision, this court \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 6 of 8\nheld that based on the affidavits, the Final Rule would result in chilled speech of the members of \nthe Plaintiff Organizations based on their beliefs.  To provide relief to all Plaintiffs, the court \nenjoined the Final Rule from being implemented against any school attended by the members of \nthe Plaintiff Organizations or a minor child of a member of Moms for Liberty.  This court’s ruling \ndid not state that it was limited to individuals who were members of a Plaintiff Organization on a \ncertain date.  Individuals are free to join or leave an organization whenever they so choose.  In \nsupport of their motion that the court must limit the scope to members as of a certain date, \nDefendants cite to Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 397 (6th Cir. 2022) (Sutton, C.J., concurring) \nand American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 547 (1974).  As noted by Plaintiffs, \nhowever, those cases do not answer the question here.  Defendants do not cite to any authority \nfinding that injunctive relief cannot extend to prospective members of an organization that was \ngranted injunctive relief. \nBy  contrast,  Plaintiffs  have  pointed  to  authority  that  granted  injunctive  relief  to  an \norganizations’ members, both current and prospective.  See Doc. 63 at 11 (citing Franciscan All., \nInc. v. Becerra, 553 F. Supp. 3d 361, 378 (N.D. Tex. 2021); Religious Sisters of Mercy v. Cochran, \nNo. 3:16-CV-00386, 2021 WL 1574628, at *2 (D.N.D. Feb. 19, 2021); and Christian Emps. All. \nv. Azar, No. 3:16-CV-309, 2019 WL 2130142, at *6–7 (D.N.D. May 15, 2019)); see also Reaching \nSouls Int'l, Inc. v. Azar, No. CIV-13-1092-D, 2018 WL 1352186, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Mar. 15, \n2018); Catholic Benefits Ass’n v. Hargan, No. CIV-14-685-R (W.D. Okla. Mar. 7, 2018).  Indeed, \nthe Western District of Oklahoma initially limited injunctive relief to current members of the \nplaintiff organization in a suit challenging the contraceptive mandate.  See Cath. Benefits Ass'n \nLCA v. Sebelius, 24 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1106–07 (W.D. Okla. 2014).  However, in Hargan, a \nsubsequent suit seeking relief for new members of the same organization, the court extended relief \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 7 of 8\nto both current and future members of certain groups of the plaintiff organization.  Azar, 2019 WL \n2130142, at *4-*5 (discussing Hargan).  And, in a case that bears at least some resemblance to \nthis one, Pierce v. Soc'y of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), \nprivate schools sought injunctive relief against enforcement of a compulsory public education \nstatute.  The Supreme Court upheld injunctive relief against the “unwarranted compulsion which \n[government officials] are exercising over present and prospective patrons of” the plaintiff schools.  \nId. at 535 (emphasis added).  More generally, when a publicly-traded business or an organization \nobtains, or appears poised to obtain, something of value through litigation, nothing prohibits \nmembers of the general public from trying to benefit from that by investing in the company or \njoining the organization.  Defendants have pointed to no authority to the contrary. \nBased on the foregoing, along with this court’s decision that the Plaintiff Organizations \nhave standing and its ruling regarding Plaintiffs’ claims on the merits, the court concludes that all \nof the Plaintiff Organizations’ members, current and prospective, are entitled to the relief ordered \nin this action.  The court’s order regarding identification of affected schools was the first step in \nensuring that Defendants have notice on that point.  Supplements to the original notice may be \nappropriate as the case progresses. \nSuffice it to say that, to the extent Defendants are concerned about the difficulties in \nmanaging patchwork enforcement in compliance with the preliminary injunction, this is a problem \nof DoE’s own making for the multiple reasons set forth in the court’s prior order.  One might have \nexpected that upending the operations of virtually every school in the nation by upsetting the \ndecades-long understanding of important parts of Title IX, as the Final Rule does, would result in \nsome significant difficulties for enforcement while the Final Rule undergoes judicial review.  As \nthe court suggested in its prior order, Congress has given DoE at least one tool to mitigate the \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 70   Filed 07/19/24   Page 8 of 8\nhardships that its new rule imposes on those who are subject to it while the judicial review process \nplays out in courts across the country.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 705, Congress gave DoE the authority to \npostpone the effective date of the Final Rule pending judicial review.  Maybe DoE should use that \nauthority.  \nIII.  Conclusion \n  Defendants’ motion for a partial stay pending appeal (Doc. 59) and Plaintiffs’ motion to \nrevise stay (Doc. 62) are DENIED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.  The court clarifies that \nDefendants are enjoined from enforcing the Final Rule against Kansas, Alaska, Utah, Wyoming, \nK.R.’s school, the schools attended by the current and prospective members of Young America’s \nFoundation or Female Athletes United, as well as the schools attended by the children of the \ncurrent and prospective members of Moms for Liberty.   \n  As a result of the ruling herein, Moms for Liberty is granted until July 26, 2024, to file a \nnotice of schools attended by its members’ children. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  Dated this 19th day of July, 2024. \n              __s/ John W. Broomes__________ \n              JOHN W. BROOMES \n              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n    \n8 \n ",

      "text": "Case 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 62   Filed 07/12/24   Page 1 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS \nTOPEKA DIVISION \n \n     \nSTATE OF KANSAS, ET AL.,  §   \n  §   \n  Plaintiffs,  §   \n  §   \nv.  §   \n  § \nCivil Action No. 24-4041-JWB \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  § \n§ \nEDUCATION, ET AL. \n§ \n   \n§ \n  Defendants. \n \nPLAINTIFF MOMS FOR LIBERTY’S MOTION TO REVISE STAY/PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION ORDER \n  Moms for Liberty moves the Court to revise its stay/preliminary injunction order so as to \nenjoin Defendants from enforcing the Final Rule against any K-12 school in any county in which \nthe child of a member of Moms for Liberty resides.1 \nBACKGROUND \n  On July 2, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay/preliminary injunction of \nthe Final Rule. In determining the scope of its order, the Court enjoined Defendants from \nenforcing the Final Rule within the four plaintiff states and “at any school attended by a member \nof Young America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United, as well as any school attended by a \nminor child or a member of Moms for Liberty.” Slip Op. at 45. To effectuate this order, the Court \ndirected these organizations, including Moms for Liberty, to file a notice “identifying the schools \nwhich their member or their members’ children, as applicable, attend.” Id. at 47. \n \n1 Counsel has conferred and defense counsel indicates that Defendants intend to oppose this \nmotion and will file a response by Sunday, July 14. \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 62   Filed 07/12/24   Page 2 of 6\n  Plaintiff Moms for Liberty is a national organization with over 130,000 members. Decl. of \nTiffany Justice (Ex. A) at ¶ 5. When an individual joins Moms for Liberty, the new member is \nnot asked in which school(s) their child/children are enrolled. Id. at ¶ 6. Rather, Moms for \nLiberty records the location of their members based on the county in which a member resides. Id. \nat ¶ 7. Congruent with this method of recording member location, Moms for Liberty has \napproximately 300 county chapters. Id. Moms for Liberty uses this method of recording its \nmembership in part in response to member privacy and security concerns. Id. at ¶ 9. Evident of \nthis concern, members of Moms for Liberty have been the target of doxing campaigns. Id. at ¶ 13. \nFurther, when some members of the public have learned the identities of the children of Moms \nfor Liberty members, they have posted information and pictures of the children online. Id. Thus, \nin addition to not possessing the school-specific list requested by the court, Moms for Liberty is \nconcerned that the public dissemination of such a list, either through a court filing or by the \nDepartment of Education, would jeopardize the privacy and safety of its members and their \nchildren. See id. at ¶ 9−16. Finally, obtaining a complete and accurate list of schools attended by \nchildren of 130,000 members—a number that well exceeds 130,000 schools where many \nmembers have multiple children in different schools—is likely an impossible task and a task \nthat presents an immeasurable administrative and time burden on Moms for Liberty. See id. at \n¶ 8. \nSTANDARD \n  “A “district court has inherent power to modify . . . a preliminary injunction.” Basic Rsch., \nL.L.C. v. Cytodyne Techs., Inc., Case No. 2:99-CV-343K, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23454, at *34 (D. \nUtah Dec. 20, 2000) (citing Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corp of Eng’gs, 732 F.2d 253, 256 (2d Cir. 1984)); \nsee also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 492 (1965) (“[D]istrict courts retain power to modify \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 62   Filed 07/12/24   Page 3 of 6\ninjunctions in light of changed circumstances.”). A district court may modify its preliminary \ninjunction based on changed circumstances or in instances where revision is “equitable in light \nof subsequent changes in the facts or law or for any other good reason.” Id. (emphasis added) \n(quoting Movie Sys. Inc. v. MAD Minneapolis Distrib., 717 F.2d 427, 430 (9th Cir. 1983)). \nARGUMENT \n  At the time this Court directed Moms for Liberty to disclose a list of schools attended by \nits members children, the district court did not have before it the benefit of a record on how \nMoms for Liberty tracks its membership or on the threats, harassment, and privacy invasions \nexperienced by the member of Moms for Liberty and their children. Nor did Moms for Liberty \nhave reason to place this evidence before the district court because Plaintiffs had argued for a \nnationwide stay/preliminary injunction based on this Court’s authority under 5 U.S.C. § 705. See, \ne.g., Tennessee v. Becerra, Case No. 1:24-cv-161-LG-BWR, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n119525, at *36 (S.D. Miss. July 3, 2024) (“‘Nothing in the text of Section 705, nor of Section 706, \nsuggests that . . . preliminary . . . relief under the APA needs to be limited to’ the plaintiff. \n‘Instead, the scope of preliminary relief under Section 705 aligns with the scope of ultimate relief \nunder Section 706, which is not party-restricted and allows a court to “set aside” an unlawful \nagency action’ . . . . When a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the \nordinary result is that the rules are vacated – not that their application to the individual \npetitioners is proscribed.” (quoting Career Coll. & Schs. Of Tex. v. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 255 \n(5th Cir. 2024))). Meanwhile, Defendants argued for a stay/preliminary injunction applicable to \nonly the four plaintiff states. The Court adopted a thoughtful middle-ground approach. In doing \nso, though, it introduced a scope of relief on which Moms for Liberty had no cause to present the \nevidence that accompanies this motion. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 62   Filed 07/12/24   Page 4 of 6\n  Based on the newly presented evidence, including the impracticality of Moms for Liberty \nobtaining the names of the elementary, middle, and high schools attended by the children of all \nits 130,000 members, Moms for Liberty urges the Court to revise its directive that Moms for \nLiberty submit a list of schools. Instead, Moms for Liberty asks the Court to permit it to submit \na list of counties in which its members reside. This approach ensures that all members of Moms \nfor Liberty receive relief under the Court’s preliminary order while also respecting the Court’s \nguiding principle that granting the total relief sought by Plaintiffs, in the form of a nationwide \ninjunction, is disfavored and would place an improper burden on Defendants. See Slip Op. at \n40−44. Furthermore, imposing a county-based injunction for K-12 schools draws the enjoinment \nline far closer to the level of local government that would be forced to enact policies in accord \nwith the Final Rule. School districts, rather than individual schools, typically have the authority \nto adopt such policies. Further, absent modification of the order, school districts may be forced \nto adopt patchwork policies. This is because, for example, Defendants would have the ability to \nenforce the Final Rule, within a single school district, as to a high school that no child of a \nmember of Moms for Liberty attends but could not do to a middle school, situated directly next \nto the high school, at which a child of a member of Moms for Liberty dose attend. \nCONCLUSION \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Moms for Liberty moves this Court to modify its order granting \nPlaintiffs motion for stay/preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Final \nRule against any K-12 school in any county in which the child of a member of Moms for Liberty \nresides.2 \n \n2 In the event the Court grants this motion, so as to meet the Court’s July 15, 2024, deadline, \nMoms for Liberty includes with this motion a list of counties in which its members and the \nchildren of its members reside, submitted as Exhibit B. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:24-cv-04041-JWB-ADM   Document 62   Filed 07/12/24   Page 5 of 6\nRespectfully submitted this 12th day of July, 2024. \n \n \n            KRIS W.
