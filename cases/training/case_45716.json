    "summary": "<p>This is a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration's SAVE plan for student loan forgiveness.&nbsp;The Attorneys General of seven states (Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma) brought this lawsuit against the Biden Administration (President Joseph Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, in their official capacities, and the US Department of Education) on April 9, 2024. The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and was assigned to Judge Sarah E. Pitlyk, then reassigned to Judge John A. Ross.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The SAVE plan was created by a rule (\"the Final Rule\") promulgated by the Department of Education on July 10, 2023. The SAVE plan was a modification of the Department's previous income-contingent repayment plan, called REPAYE, which had reduced borrowers' monthly payments based on income and forgiven loans after 20 or 25 years. The changes in SAVE included lower monthly payments (often to $0), no accrued interest, and earlier forgiveness (sometimes as soon as 10 years). The states argued that the SAVE plan constituted governmental overreach that would substantially harm the states&rsquo; economic interests.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act, raising several challenges to the Final Rule. First, the plaintiffs argued that the Final Rule violated the constitutional separation of powers by implementing a significant policy change without congressional action, which is barred by the Major Questions Doctrine. The plaintiffs argued that the doctrine applied because student loan forgiveness was a politically contentious and economically impactful issue. The states further alleged that the Final Rule contradicted the Department's earlier definition of &ldquo;income-contingent repayment plan&rdquo; and that the Department had not previously used such a plan to subsidize interest or change the 20-year statutory term for forgiveness. The plaintiffs also alleged that the Final Rule 1) exceeded statutory authority by going beyond what the Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed, 2) was arbitrary and capricious, and 3) violated procedural rules due to an insufficient comment period. The states requested injunctive relief preliminarily and permanently enjoining implementation and enforcement of the SAVE plan, a declaratory judgment, and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, 2024, the plaintiffs asked the court to stay the Final Rule, issue a temporary restraining order, or preliminarily enjoin the rule. The Biden Administration moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and improper venue on May 7, 2024. In its June 24, 2024 order, the court denied the motion to dismiss because it found that Missouri had standing due to its connection with MOHELA, a student loan servicer that is an \"instrumentality\" of Missouri. It also held that the venue was proper. In the same order, the court granted in part the states&rsquo; request for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the loan forgiveness aspect of the SAVE plan went beyond statutory authority and violated the separation of powers, though it held they were unlikely to succeed on the arbitrary and capricious and procedural violation claims. Though the plaintiffs had asked the court to enjoin the entire Final Rule, it held that the forgiveness portion of the SAVE plan was the only part likely to be unlawful, so it enjoined the federal government from granting any further loan forgiveness for borrowers but left the rest of the Final Rule in place. 2024 WL 3104514.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the June 24 order, the federal government filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on June 27, 2024 (docket no. 24-2332). The plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal of the same order on June 28, 2024 (docket no. 24-02351), seeking an expanded injunction to cover not only the loan forgiveness part of the SAVE plan, but to also enjoin the department from implementing other parts of the SAVE plan such as the nonaccrual of interest and the payment-threshold changes. The same day, the plaintiffs moved for an injunction pending appeal in the district court, asking it to fully enjoin the Final Rule. The plaintiffs requested that the district court reconsider its injunction in response to a recent order in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/45715/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kansas v. Biden</a>,</em> which the plaintiffs relied on to show the entire Final Rule was unlawful. The court denied the motion on July 10, 2024, finding no reason to reconsider its injunction.</p>\r\n<p>At the Eighth Circuit, the plaintiffs moved for an injunction pending appeal and a stay of the entire Final Rule while that motion was pending. On July 18, 2024, the Eighth Circuit stayed the Final Rule; a few weeks later, on August 9, it granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction pending appeal. The Eighth Circuit explained that, after the district court had issued an injunction against the loan forgiveness aspects of the SAVE plan, the Biden Administration had combined the surviving aspects of the SAVE plan with loan forgiveness aspects of a different repayment plan to essentially circumvent the injunction. In order to prevent this, the Eighth Circuit enjoined the federal government from forgiving SAVE plan loans, failing to charge accrued interest on those loans, or reducing monthly payments based on SAVE's payment-threshold provisions. The Biden Administration subsequently moved for clarification as to the scope of the injunction, but the Eighth Circuit denied the motion on August 19, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>Oral argument in the Eighth Circuit took place on October 24, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2025, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings and with instructions to modify the preliminary injunction to enjoin the entire SAVE Rule. 128 F.4th 979.</p>\r\n<p>On April 18, 2025, the District Court adopted the mandate of the Eighth Circuit. Since April, there has not been any movement in the court, as the parties attempt to resolve this case out of court, with status updates to the court every 90 days. On October 2, 2025, the Judge Ross issued a stay on the status updates due to the federal government shutdown, with the next status update due 10 days after funding is restored to the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

BIDEN, Jr., et al., \n \n                         Defendants. \n \nMOTION FOR INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL  \nOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE STAY OF AGENCY ACTION \n  As directed by Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(C), Plaintiff States must move this Court for an \ninjunction pending appeal before so moving in the Eighth Circuit.  In light of developments late \nlast night in the Kansas case, Plaintiff States now move for an injunction pending appeal or, in the \nalternative, a temporary administrative stay to give the Eighth Circuit time to consider the States’ \nforthcoming motion in that court.  The States seek relief that bars Defendants from further \nimplementing the Final Rule titled “Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford \nFederal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL Program),” 88 Fed. \nReg. 43,820, before appellate review.   \n  While the States agree with this Court’s order enjoining the forgiveness part of the Final \nRule, Judge Crabtree’s opinion in the Kansas case explains why the entire Final Rule is unlawful, \nincluding those provisions that change payment thresholds (increase income exemption and \ndecrease payment amount) and that forgive interest accrual.  Those provisions likewise harm the \nPlaintiff States.  While the order in Kansas indirectly protects Plaintiff States here (because it has \nnationwide effect), Defendants late last night moved to stay the Kansas injunction by 3:00 p.m. \n \n   1 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 2 of 10 PageID #:\n1121\ntoday, so an injunction pending appeal here (or an administrative stay of the rule) is necessary to \nprevent further injury.  \nInjunction Pending Appeal \n  On Monday, June 24, 2024, this Court granted in part, and denied in part, Plaintiff States’ \nMotion to Stay, or, in the alternative, a Preliminary Injunction (ECF 7).  ECF 35, at 61. In that \nruling, this Court recognized that the Plaintiff States have standing under the exact theory the \nSupreme Court recognized in Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 482 (2023).  Id. at 34–39.  Specifically, \nthe Court found that “Plaintiffs have established standing through the alleged injuries to MOHELA \nand thus Missouri.”  Id. at 36. \n  As to the merits, the Court’s opinion was split.  While the Court agreed with Plaintiff States \n“on their claim that the Secretary has overstepped its authority by promulgating a loan forgiveness \nprovision as part of the SAVE program,” Id. at 45, the Court separately held that Plaintiffs did not \nestablish a likelihood of success on the merits for their claims on payment schedules and interest \naccrual forgiveness because, in this Court’s reading, Congress had not “explicitly or implicitly \nlimited” the Secretary’s authority to “create such a comparatively generous plan” or prohibit \n“interested accrual and capitalization.”  Id. at 42–43.   \n  In contrast, the court in Kansas ruled that the entirety of “the SAVE Plan exceeds the \nSecretary’s authority.”  Kansas v. Biden, No. 6:24-cv-01057, ECF 76 at 24 (June 24, 2024).1  But \nthat court preliminarily enjoined only those provisions that go into effect on July 1 because of \nconcerns that the plaintiffs there may not have established irreparable harm for other provisions.  \nFor example, the Kansas court noted that the plaintiffs in that case “didn’t include any allegations \n                                                           \n1  https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ksd.151881/gov.uscourts.ksd.151\n881.76.0_1.pdf;  https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ksd.151881/gov.uscourts\n.ksd.151881.77.0_3.pdf \n \n   2 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 3 of 10 PageID #:\n1122\nabout FFEL loan consolidation when they filed their Complaint.”  Id. at 25–28.  The States here \ndid do so.  E.g., ECF 1 ¶¶ 121–28.  \n  Following this Court’s ruling, Defendants immediately announced that “[t]he Department \nof Justice will be appealing [the decision] to block key provisions of our SAVE Plan” and would \n“vigorously defend” the Final Rule.  Bianca Quilantan, White House to Appeal Student Loan \nRepayment Plan Ruling (June 25, 2024).2  They then filed a notice of appeal in this Court and in \nthe Kansas court.  See ECF 37, Kansas, ECF 78.  But they waited nearly four days before filing—\nlate last night—an emergency motion for stay pending appeal in the Kansas court.  Kansas, ECF \n80.  That motion requested a stay of the preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, a narrowing \nof the Kansas court’s injunction.  Id.; see also ECF 81.3  In light of this development, Plaintiff \nStates now—just hours after Defendants’ filing—respectfully move this Court to prospectively \nenjoin implementation of the payment threshold and interest accrual provisions, pending appeal to \nthe Eighth Circuit. \n  Plaintiff States reiterate their position that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims—including those claims concerning the Final Rule’s payment schedules and interest \n                                                           \n2 https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/25/biden-administration-student-loan-repayme\nnt-appeal-00164820 \n3 Plaintiff States are greatly concerned about certain language in the Defendants’ Kansas \nbriefing suggesting they may move forward with certain forgiveness under the SAVE Plan in \nviolation of this Court’s order.   Specifically, Defendants offer that “the Department has also \nceased implementing the SAVE Plan’s shortened timeline to forgiveness.”  Kansas, ECF 81 at 4 \n(emphasis added).  Defendants’ language suggests that they intend to still permit forgiveness for \nother borrowers under the SAVE Plan, in direct conflict with this Court’s finding that “Congress \nhas made clear under what circumstances loan forgiveness is permitted, and the ICR plan is not \none of those circumstances.”  ECF. 35, at 44; see also id. at 3 (“the Court finds it necessary to \nenjoin Defendants from any further implementation of the Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions \nuntil this matter can be fully litigated.” (emphasis added)); id. at 37 (“Granting Plaintiffs’ requested \ninjunctive relief would redress this impending harm by stopping any additional forgiveness.” \n(emphasis added)); id. at 55 n.24 (“an injunction preventing any further loan forgiveness will \nadequately address any alleged harm.” (emphasis added)).  Defendants should clarify whether the \nDepartment plans to forgive any SAVE Plan loans that are not on a “shortened timeline.” \n \n   3 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 4 of 10 PageID #:\n1123\naccrual—and incorporate their prior analysis of those issues here.  See Doc. 10, at 31–48; Doc. 26, \nat 34–53.  Indeed, the Kansas court’s decision finding the entire Final Rule unlawful suggests \nPlaintiff States here have a fair chance of success on appeal.  Plaintiff States offer two quick \nresponses to this Court’s ruling on the payment-threshold and interest provisions.  \n  First, Plaintiff States have alleged harm from more than just the forgiveness provision.  \nWhile that provision is perhaps the most damaging to the States, the interest accrual and payment-\nthreshold changes also harm the States by making federal loans comparatively more attractive than \nthe FFELP loans held by MOHELA and the loans offered by the Bank of North Dakota.  The \nStates in the Kansas case prevailed on a similar standing theory.  Kansas, ECF 21, at 21–23.  \nForgiveness of interest accrual also harms MOHELA in the same way forgiveness in general does: \nit reduces the time MOHELA will be able to service accounts and thus reduces administrative \nservicing fees. \n  Second, this Court’s opinion appears to conflate interest accrual and interest capitalization.  \nWhile Plaintiff States agree with this Court that the Secretary has authority to limit how much \naccrued interest is then capitalized (i.e., converted to principal), 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(e)(5), the \nSecretary’s authority is limited to deciding whether and when accrued interest will capitalize or \nnot; he has no authority to forgive interest, whether capitalized or uncapitalized.  Indeed, the ICR \nstatute requires repayment of the “unpaid principal amount of the loan, any accrued interest, and \nany fees.”  Id. § 1087e(e)(5) (emphasis added).  The provision forgiving accrued interest should \nbe enjoined pending appeal. \n  An injunction pending appeal is also appropriate for several additional reasons: \n1.  District courts throughout the Eighth Circuit have issued injunctions pending appeals so \nlong as the legal questions are “substantial” or “close.”  See, e.g., Sweeney v. Bond, 519 F. Supp. \n124, 132 (E.D. Mo. 1981) (substantial), aff’d, 669 F.2d 542 (8th Cir. 1982); Perrin v. Papa Johns \n \n   4 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 5 of 10 PageID #:\n1124\nInt’l, Inc., No. 4:09CV01335, 2014 WL 306250, at *2 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 28, 2014) (close); see also \nPopulation Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1078 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“It will ordinarily be enough \nthat the [movant] has raised serious legal questions going to the merits, so serious, substantial, \ndifficult as to make them a fair ground of litigation”) (quoting Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n \nv. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).   \nHere, as evidenced by the Kansas court’s finding that the entire Final Rule is unlawful, \nsubstantial and close legal questions exist as to whether Congress delegated to the Secretary, under \nthe ICR provisions, authority to set repayment schedules as low as $0 per month across the life of \nthe loan and forgive interest payments.  Judge Crabtree’s opinion in Kansas found that the payment \nterms outlined in the Final Rule “go[] beyond Congress’s limits—for the first time . . . without \nclear congressional authorization.”  Kansas, ECF 76, at 22–23.  An injunction pending appeal \nwould allow for all the challenged provisions to be reviewed by the appellate court together, \nwithout concern that certain provisions may be implemented prospectively.  This is especially so \nin light of the Defendants’ motion for stay before the Kansas court (and likely to be raised before \nthe Tenth Circuit).  There, the Defendants principally argue that the three remaining plaintiff \nstates—Alaska, South Carolina, and Texas—lack standing to bring their claims, and noted that \nthose states’ instrumentality theories were found to be “different—and weaker” than that of \nMissouri through MOHELA.  ECF 81, at 7.  Defendants have asked for the Kansas court to rule \nby 3:00 p.m. today.  Id., at 17.  Should Judge Crabtree agree to Defendants’ request—or should \nthey prevail in the Tenth Circuit on their standing argument—challenged portions of the Final Rule \nwill be allowed to go into effect before appellate review.  Such a fragmented approach should be \navoided.  \n2.  The Court’s June 24, 2024 order enjoined the forgiveness provision of the Final Rule, while \nallowing other challenged provisions—namely those concerning payment terms and interest—to \n \n   5 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 6 of 10 PageID #:\n1125\nproceed.  As discussed fully in Plaintiffs’ briefing, see Doc. 26, at 49–52, the Final Rule must \nstand (or fall) as a whole, especially where the Court found there was a “fair chance” that the \nSecretary was not statutorily authorized to promulgate the Final Rule’s cornerstone.  The language \nof Section 705 is clear that the Court may “postpone the effective date of an agency action.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 705.  The “agency action” here is the rule itself, which should be paused prospectively. \n3.  Defendants  will  suffer  no  harm  from  an  injunction  pending  appeal  with  respect  to \nprovisions already subject to a preliminary injunction by order of Judge Crabtree in the District of \nKansas.  More generally, for the reasons the States have already presented, Defendants will not \nsuffer any harm from any injunction pending appeal that applies prospectively, which is all that \nthe States seek.  \n4.  An injunction pending appeal is in the public interest.  “There is generally no public interest \nin the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters of United States v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  “[O]ur system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully \neven in pursuit of desirable ends.”  Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n141 S. Ct. 2485, 2490 (2021) (per curiam).  Here, allowing portions of the Final Rule to be \nimplemented, while Courts determine whether they are a legal exercise of Defendants’ statutory \nauthority, risks the perpetuation of unlawful agency action if an appellate court later determines \nthose provisions to be unlawful.  \n5.  Defendants’ delay in seeking relief in the Kansas court favors providing relief here.  The \nKansas court delayed effect of its injunction for six days (from June 24 to June 30) to permit \nDefendants time to seek appellate relief.  Kansas, ECF 76, at 42.  Defendants immediately \nannounced to the public that they would appeal, but they did not file their stay motion in the district \ncourt until almost midnight last night, nearly four days after the district court’s order. That left just \none business day before the Final Rule is scheduled to go into full effect.  \n \n   6 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 7 of 10 PageID #:\n1126\nAdministrative Stay \n  In the alternative, the States ask this Court to issue an administrative stay of parts of the \nFinal Rule not already enjoined—specifically, the payment-threshold provisions and the interest \naccrual provision.  This would permit the States time to seek an injunction pending appeal from \nthe Eighth Circuit.  That would avoid the whiplash that might occur if, for example, the Tenth \nCircuit were to lift the District of Kansas’ injunction—only for the Eighth Circuit in this case to \nthen impose an injunction against the same provisions.  \n  The States ask that this Court enter this kind of temporary administrative stay by Sunday, \nJune 30, 2024, staying Defendants from further implementing or effectuating provisions of the \nFinal Rule until the Eighth Circuit rules on the States’ forthcoming motion for an injunction \npending appeal.  See, e.g., A.B.-B. v. Morgan, 548 F. Supp. 3d 209, 216 (D.D.C. 2020) (granting \n“an administrative stay to preserve the status quo pending [the Court’s] ruling on plaintiffs’ \nforthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction”); Tex. Democratic Party v. Abbott, 961 F.3d \n389, 396 (5th Cir. 2020) (granting “a temporary administrative stay to consider carefully the \nmotion for stay pending appeal”).  If this Court grants an administrative stay, Plaintiff States will \nfile their stay motion promptly in the Eighth Circuit.   \n*** \nFor those reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter an injunction pending \nappeal  prohibiting  Defendants  from  implementing  other  provisions  of  the  Final  Rule—\nspecifically, the two payment threshold provisions and the interest accrual provision.  In the \nalternative, the States ask for a temporary administrative injunction lasting only long enough for \nthe Eighth Circuit to rule on the States’ forthcoming motion. \n \n   7 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  41     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 8 of 10 PageID #:\n1127\nDate: June 28, 2024  Respectfully Submitted, \n \nANDREW BAILEY  ASHLEY MOODY \nAttorney General of Missouri  Attorney General \n    \n/s/ Joshua M.

See Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal \nDirect Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, 88 \nFed. Reg. 43820 (July 10, 2023) (also known as the “Final Rule” or “SAVE”).  We \ngrant in part and deny in part the States’ motion for the following reasons. \n \nI. \n \nSAVE is the Secretary of Education’s latest regulation creating a new version \nof the income-contingent repayment (“ICR”) plan under the Higher Education Act \n(“HEA”).  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) (directing the Secretary to “offer a borrower \nof a loan made under this part a variety of plans for repayment of such loan, including \nprincipal and interest on the loan”); § 1087e(d)(1)(D) (directing the Secretary to \nestablish an ICR plan).  Before SAVE, the ICR plan was governed by the terms of a \nregulation known as REPAYE, and before REPAYE, it was governed by PAYE.  \nBoth REPAYE and PAYE forgave borrowers’ remaining principal at the end of \ntwenty  or  twenty-five  years  of  repayment,  see  Student  Assistance  General \n-2- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 2      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 5 of 12 PageID #:\n1259\nProvisions, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and William D. Ford Federal \nDirect Loan Program, 80 Fed. Reg. 67204, 67204-05 (October 30, 2015); Federal \nPerkins Loan Program, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and William D. \nFord Federal Direct Loan Program, 77 Fed. Reg. 66088, 66088-89 (November 1, \n2012),  without  clear  authorization  to  do  so  from  Congress.    See  20  U.S.C. \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D);  § 1098e(b)(7).    However,  these  plans  were  relatively \nuncontroversial as they were limited in scope and less generous than income-based \nrepayment (“IBR”) plans, which Congress had specifically established to enable \nmore-favorable repayment terms and ultimately loan forgiveness for borrowers who \ncould  demonstrate  financial  hardship.    See  § 1098e(b)(7)  (requiring  that  “the \nSecretary shall repay or cancel any outstanding balance of principal and interest due” \nonce an IBR borrower meets certain requirements).  The  new SAVE plan, by \ncontrast, is an order of magnitude broader than anything that has come before.  Its \naltered payment-threshold provisions significantly lower payment amounts, often to \n$0 per month.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43828-29, 43833, 43901-02.  SAVE additionally \ndoes not charge borrowers accrued interest and forgives principal balances much \nsooner, see id., and sets up a sliding-scale loan-forgiveness calculation under which \nloans can be forgiven in as little as 10 years.  Id. at 43891, 43902-03.  The net result \nis that millions of borrowers who opt-in to SAVE will pay nothing towards their \nprincipal balance, nothing towards interest, and then will have their untouched \nprincipal balance forgiven sooner.  See Press Release, The White House, FACT \nSHEET: President Biden Cancels Student Debt for more than 150,000 Student Loan \nBorrowers  Ahead  of  Schedule  (Feb.  21,  2024), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/21/fact-\nsheet-president-biden-cancels-student-debt-for-more-than-150000-student-loan-\nborrowers-ahead-of-schedule. \n \nThe plaintiff States sued President Joseph R. Biden, Secretary of Education \nMiguel A. Cardona, and the United States Department of Education (collectively, \nthe “Government”) to enjoin prospectively the implementation of SAVE.  The \ndistrict court granted in part the States’ motion for a preliminary injunction after \nfinding that at least one plaintiff, Missouri, had established standing through its state \n-3- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 3      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 6 of 12 PageID #:\n1260\ninstrumentality—the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri \n(“MOHELA”)—and that MOHELA was facing “certain” irreparable harm.  The \ndistrict court concluded that the States had shown a “fair chance” of success on the \nmerits of their claims both that loan forgiveness is not statutorily authorized for any \nICR plan and that SAVE violates separation of powers under the major-questions \ndoctrine.  However, the district court only enjoined the ultimate forgiveness of loans, \nfinding that the States had not shown irreparable harm with respect to the payment-\nthreshold provisions and the nonaccrual of interest. \n \nDespite the district court’s injunction, the Government continues to forgive \nloans for borrowers enrolled in SAVE.  It does so through a new so-called “hybrid \nrule.”  The Government’s hybrid rule combines the parts of SAVE that the district \ncourt did not enjoin, such as the payment-threshold provisions and nonaccrual of \ninterest, with the forgiveness-of-principal provisions in REPAYE.  Through this \nhybrid plan, the Government has been able to make it such that borrowers who, prior \nto the district court’s preliminary injunction, made reduced or $0 payments pursuant \nto SAVE before ultimately being forgiven the remainder of their balance are now, \nafter the district court’s preliminary injunction, still making the same reduced or $0 \npayments pursuant to SAVE and are still ultimately being forgiven the remainder of \ntheir loan balance pursuant to REPAYE.  Indeed, the Government concedes as much.  \nSee  Resp.  in  Opp’n  to  Emergency  Mot.  for  Inj.  Pending  Appeal  at  19-20 \n(acknowledging that “[a]s a result [of the injunction], . . . the REPAYE plan was \npartly amended and renamed [to SAVE], governed by the terms of the Final Rule \nexcept for the criteria regarding time to forgiveness, which reverted to the terms of \nthe original REPAYE plan”).  The Government’s hybrid plan was created after and \nin response to the district court’s preliminary injunction and has effectively rendered \nthat injunction a nullity.  As a result of the hybrid plan, the only practical effect of \nthe district court’s injunction is that borrowers formerly enrolled under SAVE and \nnow enrolled under the hybrid plan will not be eligible for loan forgiveness until \nthey have been making payments for at least 20 years, as opposed to as early as 10 \nyears.  But their payments are often $0 per month pursuant to the non-enjoined parts \n-4- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 4      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 7 of 12 PageID #:\n1261\nof SAVE, and after twenty years of $0 payments, the loans may still be entirely \nforgiven.  \n  \nThe Government appealed the district court’s injunction.  The States cross-\nappealed, seeking an expanded injunction pending appeal in the district court.  The \ndistrict court denied this motion before the Government could file a response.  As \nthe Government’s hybrid plan took shape, the States moved to clarify the scope of \nthe preliminary injunction in the district court, asking the district court to clarify that \nits preliminary injunction “prohibits [the Government] from using ICR authority to \nforgive loans for any borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan.”  The district court \ndenied the motion.  The States then sought an injunction pending appeal in this court.  \nIn light of the Government’s post-injunction actions, we administratively stayed \nimplementation of the hybrid rule on July 18 until the parties could fully brief the \nemergency motion for an injunction pending appeal.   \n \nII. \n \nWe now turn to the merits of the States’ emergency motion for an injunction \npending appeal.  Like the Government’s last attempt to engage in mass student-loan \ncancellation, “[w]hatever the eventual outcome of this case, it will affect the finances \nof millions of Americans with student loan debt as well as those Americans who pay \ntaxes to finance the government and indeed everyone who is affected by such far-\nreaching fiscal decisions.”  Nebraska v. Biden (Nebraska I), 52 F.4th 1044, 1045 \n(8th Cir. 2022).  “As such, we approach the motion before us with great care.”  Id. \n \n “In ruling on a request for an injunction pending appeal, the court must \nengage in the same inquiry as when it reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary \ninjunction.”  Id. at 1046; see Walker v. Lockhart, 678 F.2d 68, 70 (8th Cir. 1982).  \n“[A] district court may grant a preliminary injunction when a movant shows [1] that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, \nand [4] that an injunction is in the public interest . . . .”  Cigna Corp. v. Bricker, 103 \n-5- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 5      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 8 of 12 PageID #:\n1262\nF.4th 1336, 1342 (8th Cir. 2024) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “While no \nsingle  factor  is  determinative,  the  probability  of  success  factor  is  the  most \nsignificant.”  Id.  “A movant shows a likelihood of success on the merits when [he] \ndemonstrates a fair chance, not necessarily greater than fifty percent, that [he] will \nultimately prevail under applicable law.”  Id. at 1343 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “In circumstances where the movant has raised a substantial question and \nthe equities are otherwise strongly in his favor, the showing of success on the merits \ncan be less.”  Nebraska I, 52 F.4th at 1046 (internal quotation marks omitted); see \nalso Fennell v. Butler, 570 F.2d 263, 264 (8th Cir. 1978) (“If the balance tips \ndecidedly towards the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs have raised questions serious \nenough to require litigation, ordinarily the injunction should issue.”).   \n \nAs a threshold matter, we agree with the district court that “[t]he allegations \nin the Complaint are substantially similar to, if not identical to, those the Supreme \nCourt held were sufficient to establish Missouri’s standing just last year in Biden v. \nNebraska” (Nebraska II), 600 U.S. ----, 143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023), and thus that at least \none of the States, Missouri, has standing to sue.  See Nebraska I, 52 F.4th at 1046-\n47. \n \nNext, we turn to the “most significant” factor—the likelihood of success on \nthe merits.  See Cigna Corp., 103 F.4th at 1342.  The States have demonstrated at \nleast a “fair chance” that they will ultimately prevail under applicable law.  Id. at \n1343.  The SAVE plan is even larger in scope than the loan-cancellation program at \nissue in Nebraska II, 143 S. Ct. at 2369.  According to the same budget model issued \nby the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cited in Nebraska II, \nSAVE is anticipated to forgive an estimated $475 billion dollars in student loans.  \nSee id. at 2373; Biden’s New Income-Driven Repayment (“SAVE”) Plan: Budgetary \nCost  Estimate  Update,  Penn  Wharton  Budget  Model  (July  17,  2023).    The \nGovernment’s asserted authority to implement SAVE rests on the HEA’s directive \nto the Secretary of Education to establish “an income contingent repayment plan, \nwith varying annual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower, paid \nover an extended period of time prescribed by the Secretary, not to exceed 25 years.”  \n-6- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 6      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 9 of 12 PageID #:\n1263\n20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  We agree with the district court that the Government’s \n“interpretation” of this provision to authorize loan forgiveness of this magnitude “is \nquestionable,” especially in light of the fact that “other portions of the HEA . . . \nexplicitly permit loan forgiveness,” such as IBR plans.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b)(7) \n(requiring that “the Secretary shall repay or cancel any outstanding balance of \nprincipal and interest due” once an IBR borrower meets certain requirements).  The \nclear statutory requirement that loans in certain programs, such as IBR plans, be \ncanceled, coupled with statutory silence regarding forgiveness under ICR plans, \nsuggests that—as the district court concluded—“Congress has made it clear under \nwhat circumstances loan forgiveness is permitted, and the ICR plan is not one of \nthose circumstances.”  \n \nMoreover, the Government’s assertion that it has “discover[ed] in a long-\nextant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American \neconomy” requires us to “greet [that] announcement with a measure of skepticism.”  \nUtil. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The economic impact of SAVE is roughly nine times larger than the $50 \nbillion that triggered heightened scrutiny in Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021).  We agree with the United States District \nCourt for the District of Kansas, which also preliminarily enjoined SAVE in a case \nthat is now pending before the United States Supreme Court, that the expansion of \nICR plans from a program costing roughly $15 billion to $475 billion “expands \nagency  authority  to  such  an  extent  that  it  alters  it.”    Alaska  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of \nEduc., --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2024 WL 3104578, at *11 (D. Kan. June 24, 2024), stay \npending appeal granted, No. 24-3089 (10th Cir. June 30, 2024), application to \nvacate stay filed, No. 24A11 (U.S. July 5, 2024); see Nebraska II, 143 S. Ct. at 2369 \n(“The Secretary’s plan has modified the cited provisions only in the same sense that \nthe French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility.” (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)).  Here the Government asserts that it has discovered in a few \nprovisions of the HEA the authority to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth \nof student loans, 3,000 percent more than has ever been forgiven under any previous \nICR program.  In light of this vast assertion of newfound power, the major-questions \n-7- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 7      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 10 of 12 PageID #:\n1264\ndoctrine requires that “something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the \nagency action is necessary” in order to uphold the regulation.  West Virginia v. EPA, \n597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022).  But the text of the HEA makes a showing of even mere \nplausibility difficult, given that it demonstrates that “Congress opted to make debt \nforgiveness available only in a few particular exigent circumstances,” Nebraska II, \n143 S. Ct. at 2369, such as IBR plans, see 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b)(7).  Moreover, the \nGovernment’s asserted ability to forgive student loans through ICR plans rests on \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D)’s  requirement  that  the  Secretary  offer  “an  income  contingent \nrepayment plan, with varying annual repayment amounts based on the income of the \nborrower, paid over an extended period of time prescribed by the Secretary, not to \nexceed  25  years”  and    § 1087e(e)(4)’s  requirement  that  “[i]ncome  contingent \nrepayment  schedules  shall  be  established  by  regulations  promulgated  by  the \nSecretary and shall require payments that vary in relation to the appropriate portion \nof the annual income of the borrower . . . as determined by the Secretary.”  These \nare “wafer-thin reed[s] on which to rest such sweeping power.”  Nebraska II, 143 \nS.Ct. at 2371.  On initial review, the States have the better of the arguments on these \n“substantial questions of law which remain to be resolved.”  Nebraska I, 52 F.4th at \n1047. \n \nAs to irreparable harm, the Government concedes that it continues to forgive \nloans for borrowers enrolled in SAVE pursuant to the hybrid rule despite the district \ncourt’s injunction.  See Resp. in Opp’n to Emergency Mot. for Inj. Pending Appeal \nat 19-20.  As discussed above, the Government’s actions have resulted in there being \nalmost no practical difference in loan forgiveness for borrowers enrolled in SAVE \nbefore and after the district court’s preliminary injunction, rendering the injunction \nlargely a nullity.  In short, the Government continues to work the same irreparable \nharm on MOHELA that the district court sought to enjoin. \n \nLastly, when balancing the equities, “the key question is whether the movant’s \nlikely harm without a preliminary injunction exceeds the nonmovant’s likely harm \nwith a preliminary injunction in place.”  Cigna Corp., 103 F.4th at 1347; Morehouse \nEnters., LLC v. ATF, 78 F.4th 1011, 1018 (8th Cir. 2023) (“The third and fourth \n-8- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 11 of 12 PageID #:\n1265\nfactors for a preliminary injunction—harm to the opposing party and the public \ninterest—merge  when  the  Government  is  the  party  opposing  the  preliminary \ninjunction.”).    Among  the  considerations  here  are  that  all  borrowers  currently \nimpacted by our administrative stay are in administrative forbearance and thus not \nrequired to pay principal or interest on their loans, borrowers who have remained in \nPAYE and REPAYE plans are not impacted, and the States cannot turn back the \nclock on any loans that have already been forgiven.  See Nebraska I, 52 F.4th at \n1047-48.  We conclude that the balance of the equities in this case require us to \nintervene to preserve the status quo pending the Government’s appeal of the district \ncourt’s order.  See id. at 1048.  \n  \nIn doing so, “we have carefully considered . . . the scope of any temporary \nrelief.”  Id.  “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and \njudgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance \nof the legal issues it presents.”  Id. (quoting Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance \nProject, 581 U.S. 571, 579 (2017)).  We look to craft an injunction that is “no more \nburdensome  to  the  defendant  than  necessary  to  provide  complete  relief  to  the \nplaintiffs.”  Id. (quoting Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 \n(1994)); see also id. (discussing the scope of an emergency injunction pending \nappeal).  We therefore grant in part and deny in part the States’ emergency motion \nfor an injunction pending appeal to prohibit the use of the hybrid rule to circumvent \nthe district court’s injunction.   \n \nIII. \n \nThe Government is, for any borrower whose loans are governed in whole or \nin part by the terms of the Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. \nFord Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) \nProgram, 88 Fed. Reg. 43820, enjoined from any further forgiveness of principal or \ninterest,  from  not  charging  borrowers  accrued  interest,  and  from  further \nimplementing SAVE’s payment-threshold provisions.  This injunction will remain \n-9- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 9      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  57     Filed: 08/09/24     Page: 12 of 12 PageID #:\n1266\nin effect until further order of this court or the Supreme Court of the United States.  \nThe administrative stay is hereby superseded. \n______________________________ \n-10- \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 10      Date Filed: 08/09/2024 Entry ID: 5422990 ",

Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355 (2023), concerns the \nauthority of the President and Secretary of Education, under existing law, to forgive \nhundreds of millions of dollars of loans made to borrowers to finance the cost of \nobtaining  their  post-secondary  education.    The  origin  of  the  dispute  is  a  rule \n-2- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 2      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 7 of 29 PageID #:\n1286\npromulgated by  the Department of Education  to  modify  a pre-existing income \ncontingent repayment (ICR) plan for federal student loans.  This ICR plan, called \nSaving  on  a  Valuable  Education  (SAVE),  altered  payment  thresholds,  stopped \ninterest accrual, and forgave loan balances after as little as ten years of repayment.  \nSeven states challenged the SAVE Rule as exceeding statutory authority given to the \nSecretary  of  Education  because  they  claim  the  Secretary  cannot  forgive  loans \nthrough an ICR plan, among other things.  The district court concluded they were \nlikely to succeed on this claim and preliminarily enjoined the rule’s early loan \nforgiveness provisions.  The parties filed cross-appeals.  The Secretary of Education, \nDepartment of Education, and the President (collectively, federal officials) seek \nvacatur  of  the  preliminary  injunction,  while  the  states  request  we  broaden  the \ninjunction.   \n \nRecognizing the important interests at stake, we carefully undertake the task \nof determining whether a preliminary injunction is warranted and, if so, the scope of \nthat injunction.  Like the district court, we conclude the states are likely to succeed \nin their claim that the Secretary’s authority to promulgate ICR plans does not \nauthorize loan forgiveness at the end of the payment period.  The statute’s text and \nstructure require ICR plans to be designed for a borrower to pay his or her loan \nbalance in full through payments that can fluctuate based on income during the \npayment term.  The power Congress gave the Secretary in 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) \nto create repayment plans means the Secretary must design ICR plans leading to \nactual repayment of the loans.  The Secretary has gone well beyond this authority by \ndesigning a plan where loans are largely forgiven rather than repaid.  We thus affirm \nthe entry of the preliminary injunction, though we conclude the district court erred \nby not enjoining the entire rule and we remand with instructions to modify the \ninjunction accordingly.     \n \n-3- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 3      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 8 of 29 PageID #:\n1287\nI.  Background \n \nA.  Federal Student Loan Repayment  \n \n  In 1993, Congress authorized the federal government to directly issue loans \nto students for post-secondary education through the William D. Ford Federal Direct \nLoan program.  See Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, §§ 4011, \n4021, 107 Stat. 341, 341–42 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1087a–1087h).  \nBorrowers  may  choose  to  repay  these  loans  through  four  generally  applicable \noptions:  (1) a  standard  repayment  plan  with  fixed  payments  over  a  period  not \nexceeding ten years; (2) a graduated repayment plan with increasing payments over \na period not exceeding ten years; (3) an extended repayment plan with fixed or \ngraduated payments over a period not exceeding twenty-five years; or (4) an income \ncontingent repayment plan with varying payments based on income over a period \nnot exceeding twenty-five years.  20 U.S.C. §§ 1078(b)(9)(A), 1087e(d)(1)(A)–(D).  \nThese repayment plans have been largely consistent since the creation of the federal \ndirect student loan program.  Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) (1993), with 20 \nU.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(A)–(D) (2024).   \n \n  A decade after the Student Loan Reform Act, Congress expanded repayment \noptions for low-income borrowers by creating an income-based repayment (IBR) \nplan to limit monthly payments for borrowers experiencing a “partial financial \nhardship.”  See College Cost Reduction & Access Act, Pub. L. No. 110-84, § 203, \n121 Stat. 784, 792–95 (2007) (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. § 1098e).  IBR plans \nhave  two  central  features:  a  ceiling  on  a  borrower’s  loan  payments  and  loan \nforgiveness after twenty or twenty-five years of payments.  Under IBR, an eligible \nborrower’s monthly payments are capped at a certain percentage of his or her \nadjusted  gross  income  above  150%  of  the  federal  poverty  line.    20  U.S.C. \n§ 1098e(a)(3), (b)(1), (e).  Specifically, borrowers with loans made before July 2014 \nhave a “partial financial hardship” and are eligible for IBR if the annual amount due \non their loans under the standard repayment plan exceeds 15% of their discretionary \nincome,  which  is  the  total  of  their  adjusted  gross  income  minus  150%  of  the \n-4- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 4      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 9 of 29 PageID #:\n1288\napplicable federal poverty line.  Id. § 1098e(a)(3).  If such borrowers select IBR, \ntheir  monthly  payments  would  be  limited  to  one-twelfth  of  that  15%.    Id. \n§ 1098e(b)(1).  Since these caps on payments meant a borrower might not pay \nenough toward the loans to fully repay them, Congress provided for loan forgiveness \nfor borrowers using IBR once they made enough loan payments.  Id. § 1098e(b)(7).  \nFor borrowers who qualify for and select the IBR plan, “the Secretary shall repay or \ncancel any outstanding balance of principal and interest due” on their loans after \ntwenty-five years of qualifying payments.  Id.  Congress subsequently reduced these \nthresholds for new borrowers after July 2014, lowering the qualifying threshold and \npayment amount to 10% of the borrower’s discretionary income and permitting \nforgiveness after twenty years.  Id. § 1098e(e).   \n \nThis appeal concerns the Secretary’s recent promulgation of a revised ICR \nplan.  Unlike IBR, the ICR statutory text does not provide a specific formula for \ncalculating loan payments and does not explicitly state the Secretary can forgive \nloans.   See id.  § 1087e(e).    Instead, when  creating  a borrower’s  ICR  payment \nschedule,  the  Secretary  must  “require  payments  that  vary  in  relation  to  the \nappropriate  portion of  the  annual  income  of  the  borrower  (and  the  borrower’s \nspouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.”  Id. § 1087e(e)(4).  The \nbalance owed on a federal loan repaid through ICR “equal[s] the unpaid principal \namount of the loan, any accrued interest, and any fees, such as late charges, assessed \non  such  loan.”    Id.  § 1087e(e)(5).    To  effectively  implement  ICR,  Congress \nempowered the Secretary to “establish procedures for determining the borrower’s \nrepayment obligation on that loan for such year, and such other procedures as are \nnecessary.”  Id. § 1087e(e)(1).   \n \nSince 1994, the Department of Education has established various ICR plans, \nknown  as  ICR,2  Pay  As  You  Earn  (PAYE),  and  Revised  Pay  As  You  Earn \n \n  2ICR  is  both  the  catch-all  term  for  income  contingent  repayment  plans \ngenerally and the name of the Department’s first iteration of an ICR plan.  For clarity, \nwhen referring to the specific ICR plan called ICR, we use ICR Rule or the original \nICR plan.   \n-5- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 5      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 10 of 29 PageID #:\n1289\n(REPAYE), the last of which has been amended into the program challenged here.  \nEvery ICR plan has provided for loan forgiveness of any remaining debt at the end \nof the established payment period of twenty or twenty-five years, depending on the \nplan and the borrower’s loans.  See William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, \n59 Fed. Reg. 61664, 61666, 61669 (Dec. 1, 1994) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. \n685)  [hereinafter  ICR  Rule];  Federal  Perkins  Loan  Program,  Federal  Family \nEducation Loan Program, & William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, 77 Fed. \nReg. 66088, 66139–40 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pts. 674, 682, 685) (Nov. 1, 2012) \n[hereinafter PAYE Rule]; Student Assistance General Provisions, Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program, & William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, 80 Fed. \nReg. 67204, 67241–42 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pts. 668, 682, 685) (Oct. 30, \n2015) [hereinafter REPAYE Rule].  Payment provisions under each ICR plan have \ndiffered.  Under the original ICR plan, a borrower’s payments were determined \neither by a formula multiplying the borrower’s adjusted gross income by a payback \nrate, which ranged from 4% to 15% depending on the amount of the loans, or by a \ncapped amount equal to what a borrower would repay monthly in a twelve-year \nrepayment period.  See ICR Rule, 59 Fed. Reg. at 61698–99.  PAYE and REPAYE \nwere promulgated  after  the  statutory  amendments  creating  IBR  and  essentially \nadopted the statutory payment structure available for IBR into ICR, though with \nlooser  eligibility  requirements  and  shorter  loan  forgiveness  timelines  for  some \nborrowers  than  IBR.    See  PAYE  Rule,  77  Fed.  Reg.  at  66136–37,  66139–40; \nREPAYE Rule, 80 Fed. Reg. at 67239–42.  As a result, the newer ICR plans \nresemble IBR, even though they are enacted under a separate repayment scheme.   \n \nB.  SAVE Rule \n \n  In  2021,  citing  rising  student  loan  debt,  the  Department  of  Education \nconvened a committee to consider changes to rules governing ICR and IBR plans.  \nThe Secretary announced the proposed rule in January 2023 and published the final \nrule  with  minimal  changes  ten  days  after  the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  the \nSecretary’s  HEROES  Act  forgiveness  plan.    See  Improving  Income  Driven \nRepayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal \n-6- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 6      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 11 of 29 PageID #:\n1290\nFamily Education Loan (FFEL) Program, 88 Fed. Reg. 43820 (July 10, 2023) (to be \ncodified at 34 C.F.R. pts. 682, 685) [hereinafter SAVE Rule]; Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. \nat 2355, 2362.   \n \n  In comparison to earlier ICR and IBR plans, the SAVE plan protected more \nof a borrower’s income by reducing the amount of income subject to loan payments, \neliminated interest accrual, and expedited loan forgiveness for most borrowers.  See \nSAVE Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 43901–03.  Regarding payments and interest, SAVE \noffers more favorable terms than an eligible borrower would receive under IBR.  It \nreduced the amount of income that was considered “discretionary” — a borrower’s \nincome up to 225% of the federal poverty line was excluded rather than 150% under \nIBR, PAYE, and the former REPAYE plans.  See SAVE Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at \n43901–02.  Then, it further lowered the portion of discretionary income a borrower \nwith undergraduate loans would be required to pay monthly to one-twelfth of 5% of \nhis discretionary income.  Id.  If the monthly payment amounts calculated under \nSAVE did not fully cover the accrued interest for that month, any remaining interest \nwould not be charged to the borrower.  Id. at 43902.   \n \nAs to loan forgiveness, SAVE starts cancelling outstanding balances after 120 \nmonths of payments for any borrower whose “total original principal balance on all \nloans that are being paid under the [SAVE] plan was less than or equal to $12,000.”  \nId. at 43903.  For each $1,000 above $12,000 for the total original balance, an \nadditional twelve months of payments would be necessary for forgiveness.  Id.  After \ntwenty years of payments for borrowers with only undergraduate loans or twenty-\nfive years of payments for those with graduate loans, any remaining balance would \nbe forgiven, regardless of the amount borrowed.  Id. at 43902–03.   \n \n  The impacts of these changes for loan repayment are substantial.  Under prior \nICR plans, “borrowers would repay approximately $11,800 per $10,000 of debt,” or \n$10,956 per $10,000 for borrowers with only undergraduate loans.  Id. at 43880.  But \nunder SAVE, the same borrowers would pay only $7,000 per $10,000 borrowed, or \n$6,121  per  $10,000  for  a  borrower  with  only  undergraduate  debt.    Id.  \n-7- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 7      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 12 of 29 PageID #:\n1291\nUndergraduate-only borrowers with “lifetime income in the bottom quintile are \nprojected to repay $873 per $10,000” if enrolled in SAVE.  Id. at 43881.  Only \nborrowers in the top two quintiles of lifetime income could expect to pay more than \nthey initially borrowed under SAVE.  See id.  Of the 7.5 million borrowers enrolled \nin SAVE as of February 2024, 4.3 million pay $0 monthly towards their loans under \nSAVE.  Biden-Harris Administration Approves $1.2 Billion in Loan Forgiveness for \nOver  150,000  SAVE  Plan  Borrowers,  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.  (Feb.  21,  2024), \nhttps://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/biden-harris-administration-\napproves-12-billion-loan-forgiveness-over  [hereinafter  Biden-Harris \nAdministration Approves $1.2 Billion in Loan Forgiveness].     \n \nAlthough the SAVE Rule was set to take full effect on July 1, 2024, the \nSecretary  designated  several  portions  for  early  implementation,  including \nforgiveness for borrowers with low initial principal balances.  See SAVE Rule, 88 \nFed. Reg. at 43820–21; Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. \nFord Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) \nProgram, 89 Fed. Reg. 2489 (Jan. 16, 2024) [hereinafter Early Implementation of \nForgiveness].  The Department started forgiving loans under SAVE in February \n2024.  Biden-Harris Administration Approves $1.2 Billion in Loan Forgiveness.       \n \nC.  Procedural History \n \n  A group of seven states brought this challenge to the SAVE Rule in April \n2024, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and vacatur of the rule.  They assert \nvarious provisions of the SAVE Rule exceed the Secretary’s authority and are \narbitrary and capricious.  The states sought a stay or preliminary injunction against \nimplementation of the SAVE Rule, and the district court granted their request in part, \nenjoining the loan forgiveness provisions of the SAVE Rule while leaving the \nremaining provisions in effect.  After the injunction, the Department revived the pre-\nexisting  loan  forgiveness  provisions  under  REPAYE  that  the  SAVE  Rule  had \namended  and  continued  forgiving  loans  after  twenty  or  twenty-five  years  of \npayments.    In  response,  the  states  requested  the  district  court  clarify  that  its \n-8- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 8      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 13 of 29 PageID #:\n1292\npreliminary injunction prohibited forgiveness under ICR plans, which the district \ncourt denied.   \n \n  Both  parties  appealed,  and  the  states  sought  an  administrative  stay  and \ninjunction pending appeal of the SAVE Rule and the revived forgiveness.  We \ngranted in part the states’ request, enjoining the federal officials “from any further \nforgiveness of principal or interest, from not charging borrowers accrued interest, \nand from further implementing SAVE’s payment-threshold provisions.”  Missouri \nv. Biden, 112 F.4th 531, 538 (8th Cir. 2024).  The Supreme Court denied the federal \nofficials’ application to vacate our injunction.  Biden v. Missouri, No. 24A173, 145 \nS. Ct. 109 (2024).  We then granted in part the federal officials’ motion for an \nexpedited appeal.   \n \nOn appeal, the federal officials assert the states lack standing and the district \ncourt erred in granting any injunction.  The states seek a broadened injunction of the \nentire rule, contesting both the district court’s assessment of the proper scope of \npreliminary  relief  and  their  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  their  other \nchallenges to the rule.       \n \nII.  Analysis \n \n  “We review the grant [or denial] of a preliminary injunction for abuse of \ndiscretion.”  Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Erikson, 103 F.4th 1352, 1355 (8th Cir. 2024) \n(quoting PCTV Gold, Inc. v. SpeedNet, LLC, 508 F.3d 1137, 1142 (8th Cir. 2007)).  \n“A district court abuses its discretion when ‘it rests its conclusions on clearly \nerroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.’”  Id. (quoting Miller v. \nHonkamp Krueger Fin. Servs., Inc., 9 F.4th 1011, 1013–14 (8th Cir. 2021)).  Thus, \nwe review underlying factual findings regarding the states’ injuries for clear error \nand legal conclusions about the states’ likelihood of success in their challenges to \nthe rule de novo.  See Lindell v. United States, 82 F.4th 614, 618 (8th Cir. 2023). \n \n-9- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 9      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 14 of 29 PageID #:\n1293\nA.  Standing \n \n  We  first  turn  to  the  threshold  question  of  standing  to  ensure  we  have \njurisdiction over this case.  See Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 892 (8th Cir. \n2000).  Standing requires (1) that the plaintiff will “suffer[] an ‘injury-in-fact,’ (2) a \ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, and (3) that the \ninjury likely will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).  The states raise various theories to show \nthey have standing.  We agree with the district court that at least one state, Missouri, \nhas standing to sue due to financial harms to the Higher Education Loan Authority \nof the State of Missouri (MOHELA), and its standing is sufficient to resolve this \nappeal.   \n \n  As the Supreme Court previously held, Missouri suffers a cognizable financial \nharm when the Secretary enacts a plan that discharges student loans and closes \naccounts serviced by MOHELA.  Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2366.  The SAVE Rule \ndoes so — it leads to loan forgiveness and closure of accounts serviced by MOHELA \nin as few as ten years of repayments.  See SAVE Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 43902–03.  \nOnce an account is closed, MOHELA loses future fees for servicing the accounts, \nwhich reduces its profits and ability to fund education in Missouri.  See Nebraska, \n143  S.  Ct.  at  2366.    Under  the  SAVE  Rule,  around  28,000  accounts  held  by \nMOHELA have already been closed, with 53,000 more identified as eligible for \nforgiveness.  “This financial harm is an injury in fact directly traceable to the \nSecretary’s  plan”  and  redressable  through  the  relief  sought  by  the  states.    Id.  \nNevertheless, the federal officials assert Missouri lacks standing because the SAVE \nRule provides some benefits to MOHELA and MOHELA has also requested some \naccounts it previously serviced be transferred to other loan servicers.   We disagree.   \n \n  First, we reject the federal officials’ offsetting-benefits argument.  The federal \nofficials argue the SAVE Rule reduces some of MOHELA’s servicing costs because \nit “will cost almost nothing to service” any borrower whose payments are $0, and \nfewer accounts means the loan portfolio will be easier for MOHELA to manage.  But \n-10- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 10      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 15 of 29 PageID #:\n1294\nonce a plaintiff shows injury, we do not separately inquire whether the plaintiff gains \nsome benefit from other portions of the regulation.  See, e.g., NCAA v. Governor of \nNew Jersey, 730 F.3d 208, 223 (3d Cir. 2013), abrogated on other grounds by N.J. \nThoroughbred Horsemen’s Ass’n v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453 (2018); Peters v. Aetna \nInc., 2 F.4th 199, 218 (4th Cir. 2021); Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 155–56 \n(5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided court, 579 U.S. 547 (2016); Los Angeles \nHaven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 657 (9th Cir. 2011).  “Our standing \nanalysis is not an accounting exercise,” so the existence of some purported benefit \nfrom an injurious government action does not preclude standing.  NCAA, 730 F.3d \nat 223.  The supposed benefits asserted by the federal officials are thus irrelevant \nconsidering MOHELA’s undisputed lost servicing fees.  Even if we did conduct the \nbalancing sought, the district court found “[a]ny potential ‘benefits’ MOHELA \nreceives are incidental,” are “not of the same type nor [do they] arise from the same \ntransaction” as MOHELA’s injury, and “do not offset the alleged and actual harms \nexperienced by MOHELA.”  The federal officials fail to show any clear error in \nthese  factual  findings  that  warrant  disturbing  the  district  court’s  conclusions.  \nInstead, they merely imagine benefits that could accrue.   \n \nWe also are not swayed by the federal officials’ argument that MOHELA \ncannot claim injury by a loss in accounts it services because it had separately \nrequested that certain accounts be transferred from it.  It is true that in April 2024, \nMOHELA asked the Department “to transfer 1.5 million borrower accounts to one \nor more different loan servicers.”  The facts surrounding this request to transfer are \nhighly contested as to what accounts were implicated and the reasons for the request.  \nAccording to the states, MOHELA’s request primarily concerned accounts subject \nto the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and changed loan servicing \ncontracts under which these accounts were already set to be transferred to other \nservicers.  Regardless of the exact circumstances, MOHELA’s request to transfer \nsome accounts cannot be construed as a request for most of its remaining accounts \nto  close  sooner.    MOHELA  serves  8.02  million  borrowers,  with  2.24  million \naccounts  already  enrolled  in  SAVE.    While  the  federal  officials  estimate  that \napproximately 5.25 million borrowers serviced by MOHELA would not be eligible \n-11- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 11      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 16 of 29 PageID #:\n1295\nfor the shortest forgiveness timeline under the SAVE Rule, that still leaves nearly 3 \nmillion accounts that could be eligible, approximately double the amount MOHELA \nsought to have transferred.  Moreover, these 5.25 million accounts could still be \neligible for later forgiveness, depriving MOHELA of fees it would otherwise collect.  \nThe federal officials also fail to address the long-term financial impact of the SAVE \nRule as new accounts enter repayment, enroll in SAVE, are assigned to MOHELA, \nand  close  sooner  than  they  would  without  SAVE’s  forgiveness  provisions.  \nMOHELA’s one-time request for transfer does not show MOHELA is not harmed \nby the continuous closure of accounts through forgiveness under SAVE.   \n \nIn sum, we conclude MOHELA is harmed by the SAVE Rule, so Missouri \nhas standing to sue.  We therefore proceed to the merits of the preliminary injunction.   \n \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \n \nWe consider four factors when evaluating a preliminary injunction: “(1) the \nthreat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between this \nharm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on the other parties \nlitigant; (3) the probability that the movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the \npublic interest.”  Wilbur-Ellis Co., 103 F.4th at 1355–56 (quoting Home Instead, Inc. \nv. Florance, 721 F.3d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 2013)).  No factor is determinative but “the \nprobability of success factor is the most significant.”  Id. at 1356 (quoting Home \nInstead, 721 F.3d at 497).  Ultimately, “[t]he primary function of a preliminary \ninjunction is to preserve the status quo until, upon final hearing, a court may grant \nfull, effective relief.”  Id. at 1355 (quoting Rathmann Grp. v. Tanenbaum, 889 F.2d \n787, 789–90 (8th Cir. 1989)).  We conclude each factor supports a preliminary \ninjunction. \n \n1.  Probability of Success on the Merits \n \nWe first consider the most important factor — whether the states have shown \na probability of success on the merits.  See id. at 1355–56.  Ordinarily, a party need \n-12- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 12      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 17 of 29 PageID #:\n1296\nonly show a “‘fair chance’ of success on the merits,” but if it requests an injunction \nof “government action based on presumptively reasoned democratic processes,” it \n“must show that [it] ‘is likely to prevail on the merits.’”  Eggers v. Evnen, 48 F.4th \n561, 565 (8th Cir. 2022) (first quoting Rodgers v. Bryant, 942 F.3d 451, 455 (8th \nCir. 2019); and then quoting Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, 530 \nF.3d 724, 732–33 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc)).  We assume, as the parties do, the \nheightened standard applies to preliminary injunctions of agency rulemakings.  See \nFirearms Regul. Accountability Coal., Inc. v. Garland, 112 F.4th 507, 517 (8th Cir. \n2024).  The states assert the SAVE Rule exceeds the Secretary’s authority on \nmultiple fronts.  We agree with the district court that the states are likely to succeed \nin their claim that the Secretary cannot forgive loans through an ICR plan.  It is \nunnecessary to reach their remaining claims at this stage. \n \nThe states’ challenge is one of statutory interpretation.  We start with “the \nstatute’s plain language,” looking to “the meaning that proper grammar and usage \nwould assign” the text.  United States v. Lester, 92 F.4th 740, 742 (8th Cir. 2024) \n(quoting United States v. Moreira-Bravo, 56 F.4th 568, 571 (8th Cir. 2022)).  We \n“must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute” and “look to the \nstructure  of  the  statute  and  the  language  surrounding  the  term  to  ascertain  its \nmeaning.”  United States v. Zam Lian Mung, 989 F.3d 639, 642–43 (8th Cir. 2021) \n(first quoting Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014); and then quoting \nUnited States v. Kowal, 527 F.3d 741, 746 (8th Cir. 2008)).  If the text is clear, “the \njudicial inquiry must end.”  Lester, 92 F.4th at 742 (quoting United States v. Jungers, \n702 F.3d 1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2013)).  The court must aim to determine the statute’s \n“best meaning” by “deploying its full interpretative toolkit.”  See Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2271 (2024). \n \nThe federal officials primarily rest their authority to forgive student loans at \nthe end of the ICR payment period on 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D), which directs the \nSecretary to offer an ICR plan “with varying annual repayment amounts based on \nthe income of the borrower, paid over an extended period of time prescribed by the \nSecretary, not to exceed 25 years.”  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  They derive \n-13- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 13      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 18 of 29 PageID #:\n1297\ntwo principles from the statute: (1) “how much a borrower repays each year will be \n‘based on the income of the borrower’”; and (2) “no borrower will be required to \nmake payments indefinitely.”  They contend only forgiveness at the end of the \npayment period “complies with both of those principles” because if a borrower had \nto pay the full amount within the repayment period, at minimum, the “final payment \nwould be based not on her income, but rather on her outstanding balance.”  And they \nassert the “not to exceed 25 years” phrase acts as merely an upper limit on the time \nthe Secretary could require payments, but she can lower the term for payments \nbefore forgiveness as she sees fit.  Their argument rests on a flawed assumption.  \nThey assume ICR makes income the primary or only consideration in assessing a \nborrower’s loan payments.  They make income paramount rather than considering \nboth income and the loan balance together to ensure the borrower contributes a \nsufficient  portion  of  her  income  to  repay  her  loan.    The  statutory  scheme \ndemonstrates this latter approach of considering both income and the loan balance \nis the one Congress enacted.  \n \nAt the time ICR was first codified, the statute had four generally applicable \noptions for borrowers to repay “principal and interest” on their loans:  \n \n•  a standard repayment plan with a fixed payment made over a set number \nof years, not to exceed ten years;  \n \n•  an extended repayment plan with a fixed annual repayment amount paid \nover an extended period of time;  \n \n•  a graduated repayment plan, “with annual repayment amounts established \nat 2 or more graduated levels and paid over a fixed or extended period of \ntime, except that the borrower’s scheduled payments shall not be less than \n50 percent, nor more than 150 percent, of what the amortized payment on \nthe amount owed would be if the loan were repaid under the standard \nrepayment plan”; and  \n \n•  an income contingent repayment plan, with varying payments based on \nincome paid over an extended time period, not to exceed twenty-five years.  \n \n-14- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 14      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 19 of 29 PageID #:\n1298\nSee 20 U.S.C. §§ 1078(b)(1)(D), 1087e(d)(1) (1993).  While Congress has enacted \nsome modifications and added IBR, these four repayment options remain largely the \nsame today.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1) (2024).  Borrowers may choose to repay \ntheir federal direct loans through (1) fixed payments over a period not exceeding ten \nyears; (2) increasing payments over a period not exceeding ten years; (3) fixed or \ngraduated payments over a period not exceeding twenty-five years; or (4) varying \npayments based on income over a period not exceeding twenty-five years.  Id. \n§§ 1078(b)(9)(A), 1087e(d)(1).   \n \n  No one disputes the first three repayment plans in section 1078e(d)(1) require \nthe loans to be repaid in full by the end of the payment period.  The Secretary does \nnot claim, for example, the standard repayment plan would authorize her to establish \nfixed monthly payments of $5 for ten years before discharging a $100,000 loan \nbalance.  Instead, the fixed monthly payments of the standard plan are designed such \nthat a borrower makes monthly payments of an amount high enough for the loan to \nbe repaid within ten years.  After all, these are repayment plans — plans to repay or \nreturn lent money.  See Repayment, Oxford English Dictionary (2009); Repayment, \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002).  Thus, for each, the Secretary \nstarts with the loan balance and determines payments to satisfy full repayment of the \nloan under the terms of the plan.  In the standard repayment plan, the borrower pays \na fixed sum calculated to ensure full payment by the end of the payment period.  20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1078(b)(9)(A)(i), 1087e(d)(1)(A).  In the extended repayment plan, the \nborrower pays a fixed or graduated sum large enough to ensure full payment at the \nend of the extended payment period.  Id. §§ 1078(b)(9)(A)(iv), 1087e(d)(1)(C).  In \nthe graduated repayment plan, the borrower pays a set sum each year that increases \nover  the  payment  period  to  ensure  payment  in  full.    Id.  §§  1078(b)(9)(A)(ii), \n1087e(d)(1)(B).  Likewise, in the ICR plan, the borrower must make payments in \namounts that can fluctuate based on income in a manner designed to ensure payment \nin full at the end of the payment period.  See id. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  The Secretary \nconsiders  both  the  loan  balance  and  the  borrower’s  income  to  determine  an \n-15- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 15      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 20 of 29 PageID #:\n1299\nappropriate portion of his adjusted gross income to ensure repayment.3  See id. \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D), (e).   \n \nGiven that the three preceding repayment plans and their accompanying time \nperiods require payment in full, we would expect the fourth subclause to include \nsome evidence that it uniquely permits forgiveness, like Congress did when adding \nIBR as the fifth subclause by specifying that the “Secretary shall repay or cancel any \noutstanding balance of principal and interest” after a certain number of payments.  \nId. §§ 1087e(d)(1)(E), 1098e(b)(7).  Without similar clear language for ICR, the \nfederal officials claim the absence of the phrase “full repayment” and the presence \nof the words “income contingent” signify Congress expected loan repayment to be \nfully contingent on whether a borrower earned enough income and borrowed a small \nenough amount of money.  We disagree.   \n \nNone of the preceding repayment plans include the word “full” but they \nundisputedly anticipate full repayment.  See id. § 1087e(d)(1).  Thus, the absence of \n“full” under ICR does not mean repayment is partial, especially because the default \nexpectation when one discusses repayment of loans is full recompense.  If someone \nrequests repayment, we assume he requests return of the entire amount lent, plus \ninterest as applicable.  Indeed, we would expect some qualifier if partial repayment \nwas  contemplated,  and  Congress  provided  none.    To  the  contrary,  Congress \n \n  3For example, similar to past ICR plans, the Secretary could require payments \nof a set portion of a borrower’s income, readjusting the appropriate percentage if \nnecessary during the repayment period so that a borrower would stay on track for \nrepayment.  See ICR Rule, 59 Fed. Reg. at 61698–99.  Alternatively, the Secretary \ncould determine how much a borrower would have to pay annually over twenty-five \nyears to ensure full repayment, calculate the percentage of the borrower’s then-\nincome  that  would  equal  that  amount,  and  require  the  borrower  to  pay  that \npercentage  annually  during  the  repayment  period  with  the  actual  amount  paid \nvarying as the borrower’s income increases or decreases.  Thus, despite the federal \nofficials’ claims, an ICR plan resulting in actual loan repayment need not be carried \nout in a manner identical to the extended repayment plan.  A reading requiring \nrepayment under ICR does not make another repayment plan superfluous.  \n-16- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 16      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 21 of 29 PageID #:\n1300\nexplained the repayment plans are “for repayment of such loan, including principal \nand  interest”  and “[t]he balance due” on  an  ICR loan  “shall  equal  the unpaid \nprincipal  amount  of  the  loan,  any  accrued  interest,  and  any  fees.”    See  id. \n§ 1087e(d)(1), (e)(5).  This language reaffirms the default understanding of full \nrepayment.  Moreover, we are not required to guess what an “income contingent \nrepayment plan” means — the statute explains that, unlike the preceding plans, a \nborrower’s payments can shift year-to-year, increasing or decreasing as his income \nchanges.  In other words, the amount paid on the loan for each year depends on the \nborrower’s income, but his ultimate liability is still to repay the loan.  As enacted by \nCongress, it is not a program that allows a borrower to evade full repayment because \nof his income. \n \nThe federal officials claim this approach would “establish[] a student-loan \nrepayment plan that would end in a borrower’s default.”  This assumes the Secretary \nadministers an ICR plan in a way that does not ensure the borrower’s ICR payments \nresult in loan payoff at the end of the period.  ICR would not result in default for \nmost borrowers if the Secretary requires a sufficient portion of the borrower’s \nincome to be paid towards the loan to ensure full payment.  And Congress provided \nsafeguards  if  a  particular  borrower’s  payment  would  be  too  burdensome  or \ninsufficient: an alternative, case-by-case repayment plan or, in later amendments, \nIBR.  The alternative repayment plan allows the Secretary to  \n \nprovide, on a case by case basis, an alternative repayment plan to a \nborrower of  a  loan made under  this part  who  demonstrates to the \nsatisfaction  of  the  Secretary  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the \nrepayment plans available under paragraph (1) are not adequate to \naccommodate the borrower’s exceptional circumstances. \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(4).  Thus, for the borrower for whom repayment based on \nincome over twenty-five years is inadequate to repay the loan, the Secretary could \noffer an alternative repayment plan to that borrower.   \n \n-17- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 17      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 22 of 29 PageID #:\n1301\nIBR similarly protects eligible borrowers by effectively enacting a statutory \nlimit on how much of their income they would have to dedicate to loan repayment.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(a)(3), (b)(1), (b)(7), (e).  With IBR, a borrower’s monthly \npayments are limited to one-twelfth of 10 or 15% of his adjusted gross income above \n150% of the federal poverty line.  Id.  A borrower, who otherwise must dedicate \nmore than 10 or 15% of his adjusted gross income above 150% of the federal poverty \nline to loan repayment under the standard repayment plan, can choose IBR, capping \nhis monthly payments with forgiveness available after twenty to twenty-five years \nof payments, as applicable based on borrowing date.  Id.  This cap alleviates a \npotential burden for borrowers for whom repayment under ICR would require a \nsignificant percentage of their income by giving them an alternative payment plan \nwith lower payments to select.  If full repayment under ICR would require paying \nmore than 10 or 15% of a borrower’s discretionary income throughout the twenty-\nfive-year  repayment  period,  the  borrower  could  switch  to  IBR  to  reduce  his \npayments, assuming the statute’s other eligibility requirements are satisfied.  See id.  \n \nRather than implying by omission or other ambiguities, Congress has spoken \nclearly  when  creating  a  repayment  plan  with  loan  forgiveness  or  otherwise \nauthorizing it — explicitly stating the Secretary should cancel, discharge, repay, or \nassume the remaining unpaid balance.  See id. §§ 1078-10(b), 1078-11(a)(1), 1087, \n1087e(m)(1),  1087j(b),  1087ee,  1098e(b)(7).    The  statutory  text  enabling  the \ncreation of an ICR plan provides no comparable language.  See id. § 1087e(d)(1)(D), \n(e).   \n \nThe federal officials’ remaining arguments are unable to overcome the plain \ntext and context of 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D) and (e).  First, they point to the ICR \nRule and the Department’s unchanged position that it can forgive any outstanding \nbalance at the end of the repayment period.  See, e.g., ICR Rule, 59 Fed. Reg. at \n61666,  61678,  61699.    True,  courts  give  “respect”  to  “an  Executive  Branch \ninterpretation [that] was issued roughly contemporaneously with enactment of the \nstatute and remained consistent over time.”  See Loper Bright, 144 S. Ct. at 2258.  \nBut “respect” simply means “[t]he views of the Executive Branch could inform the \n-18- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 18      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 23 of 29 PageID #:\n1302\njudgment of the Judiciary, but d[o] not supersede it.”  Id.  “[T]he basic nature and \nmeaning of a statute does not change when an agency happens to be involved” or \n“has happened to offer its interpretation.”  Id. at 2271.  The agency’s consistently \nwrong interpretation cannot rewrite the statute’s text to change its meaning.  See \nCareer Colls. & Schs. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 241 (5th Cir. \n2024), cert. granted, 2025 WL 65914 (U.S. Jan. 10, 2025).   \n \nThe federal officials also cite amendments to section 1087e(e) requiring the \nDepartment to count periods of deferment based on economic hardship toward the \nICR borrower’s maximum repayment period as supporting their argument that ICR \nallows loan forgiveness.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(e)(7)(B)(i).  Put another way, \nalthough a borrower can postpone payments because of economic hardship, the \nmaximum repayment period clock continues to tick.  The federal officials claim it \nmakes little sense to count time when a borrower is experiencing an economic \nhardship towards the repayment period if there is no forgiveness because it would \nmove  a  borrower  closer  to  the  deadline  for  full  payment.    However,  these \namendments  themselves  say  nothing  about  forgiveness  despite  being  enacted \nalongside provisions explicitly providing for forgiveness.  See id.; College Cost \nReduction & Access Act §§ 203, 205, 401, 121 Stat. at 792–96, 800–01.  In any \nevent, the amendment is not irrational if forgiveness is unavailable.  It could indicate \nCongress wanted to ensure the federal government would receive full repayment \nwithin twenty-five years and did not want certain economic hardship to excuse \ndelay.  After all, in most contexts, lenders have wanted to ensure prompt repayment \nof a debt rather than looking for ways to forgive it.  Moreover, the IBR plan, created \nin the same act, minimizes harm to the borrower caused by counting such deferment \ntowards the repayment period.  A borrower with an economic hardship sufficient to \nqualify for deferment would generally have full-time employment making at most \nminimum wage or 150% of the federal poverty line.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1085(o).  Such \na borrower would likely qualify for and have minimal payments under IBR based on \nits statutory payment provisions, so he could switch to IBR to eventually obtain \nforgiveness, with the time in deferment for economic hardship counting toward his \nrequired payments.  See id. § 1098e(a)(3), (b)(1), (7). \n-19- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 19      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 24 of 29 PageID #:\n1303\n \nEven if the federal officials’ interpretation were plausible, we would expect \ngreater textual or contextual clues than the ones here to suggest the Department has \nthe authority to forgive loans under ICR rather than to build a payment schedule for \nrepayment by the end of the payment period.

Ct. at 2372–75.  \nWe are hard-pressed to conclude that Congress, by directing the Secretary to enact \na  repayment  plan  with  varying  payments  based  on  income  over  a  period  not \nexceeding twenty-five years, believed it authorized the Secretary to wipe out any \nremaining principal or interest of any borrower in as few as ten years of low or no \npayments.  After all, if Congress had given that power through ICR, creating IBR \nand requiring low-income borrowers to make payments for twenty or twenty-five \nyears to obtain forgiveness would have been unnecessary.  The separate program for \nloan  forgiveness  in ten years  for  public  service  employees  would similarly be \nsuperfluous.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m).  It makes little sense to enact these programs \nif the Secretary has always had the statutory power to wipe away debt through \naccounting tricks.  If the federal officials’ interpretation of the power under ICR is \naccepted, the Secretary could simply require a borrower to pay 0.5% of the total of \nhis adjusted gross income minus 5000% of the federal poverty line for a payment \nperiod of ten years before having his loans forgiven.  Indeed, their only cited limit is \nthe  Secretary’s  discretionary  determination  of  what  constitutes  an  “appropriate \nportion” of a borrower’s income.  See id. § 1087e(e)(4); e.g., SAVE Rule, 88 Fed. \nReg. at 43826–27, 43832–34, 43838–39.  But the Secretary’s exercise of discretion \nis hardly a limit one would expect Congress to solely rely upon in light of the \nbreathtaking power claimed by the Secretary.  The Secretary envisions the ability to \nestablish ICR plans as a nearly limitless power to transform federal loans into grants \nby virtue of modifying payment thresholds and forgiveness timelines.4  It has an \n \n  4The  consequences  of  the  vast  discretion  the  Secretary  claims  include \ndisruption of the student borrower’s expectations.  The Secretary deems ten years of \npayments as sufficient for certain borrowers, while prior ones have required twenty-\nfive years.  A borrower could spend nine years in repayment under SAVE expecting \nforgiveness the following year, only for a new secretary to exercise his discretion to \ndeem a greater number of years to be more “appropriate.”  See Loper Bright, 144 S. \n-20- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 20      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 25 of 29 PageID #:\n1304\neven  greater  economic  impact  than  the  sweeping  loan  forgiveness  program \nattempted through the HEROES Act, which the Supreme Court recognized as an \nattempt “to exercise control over ‘a significant portion of the American economy.’”  \nSee Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2373 (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. \n302, 324 (2014)).   \n \nAs with the previous attempt at loan forgiveness, the major questions doctrine \ninforms our analysis.  We assume Congress would have provided clear signs if it \nauthorized such significant power to the Secretary.  See id.  It did not.  By creating \nthe ICR plan, Congress simply created a different method to calculate payments to \nrepay student loans.  The states are therefore likely to succeed in their challenge to \nthe SAVE Rule’s forgiveness provision.  \n \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n \n  The  district  court  concluded  the  states  showed  irreparable  harm  through \nMOHELA’s lost servicing fees.  We agree.  Irreparable harm exists “when a party \nhas  no  adequate  remedy  at  law,  typically  because  its  injuries  cannot  be  fully \ncompensated through an award of damages.”  Gen. Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown’s, \nLLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009).  Once accounts are closed through SAVE’s \nforgiveness provisions, they cannot be reopened, and MOHELA will permanently \nlose any future fees.  Missouri cannot recoup that financial loss through a damages \naward because of sovereign immunity, so this constitutes an irreparable injury.  See \nIowa Utils. Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996).   \n \n \nCt. at 2285 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“[B]ecause the reasonable bureaucrat may \nchange his mind year-to-year and election-to-election, the people can never know \nwith certainty what new ‘interpretations’ might be used against them.”).  It is unclear \nwhy Congress would establish a repayment plan where the overall repaid amount of \nthe balance of the loan turns substantially on the whims of the then-secretary, leaving \nborrowers in a state of uncertainty.   \n-21- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 21      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 26 of 29 PageID #:\n1305\n  Nevertheless, the federal officials assert we should ignore this harm because \nthe states waited until nine months after the SAVE Rule was published and three \nmonths after the Secretary announced early implementation of forgiveness to seek \nan injunction.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the states’ \ndelay did not warrant denying injunctive relief.  The notice of early implementation \nof forgiveness was not published until January 2024, only three months prior to the \nstates’ motion.  Early Implementation of Forgiveness, 89 Fed. Reg. at 2489.  While \nsome forgiveness started prior to the request for a preliminary injunction, including \nsome accounts held by MOHELA, many more accounts that could be forgiven under \nthe SAVE Rule had not yet been processed.  Moreover, the continual nature of \naccounts  becoming  eligible  for  forgiveness  each  month  under  the  SAVE  Rule \nindicates that the greatest harm from implementation of the rule is yet to occur.  \nUnder these circumstances, the states’ brief delay does not undermine their claim of \nirreparable harm.     \n \n3.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \n \n  The balance of the equities and the public interest also support a preliminary \ninjunction.  These two factors merge here because the federal government is the \nparty opposing the injunction.  Morehouse Enters., LLC v. ATF, 78 F.4th 1011, 1018 \n(8th Cir. 2023).  In analyzing these factors, we ask “whether the movant’s likely \nharm without a preliminary injunction exceeds the nonmovant’s likely harm with a \npreliminary injunction in place.”  Cigna Corp. v. Bricker, 103 F.4th 1336, 1347 (8th \nCir. 2024).  As we noted in a similar case, “the equities strongly favor an injunction \nconsidering the irreversible impact the Secretary’s debt forgiveness action would \nhave.”  See Nebraska v. Biden, 52 F.4th 1044, 1047 (8th Cir. 2022).  In contrast, the \nfederal officials’ interest in implementing the SAVE Rule is minimal given the \nstates’ strong likelihood of success in showing it exceeds agency authority.  See, e.g., \nLeague of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(“There  is  generally  no  public  interest  in  the  perpetuation  of  unlawful  agency \naction.”); Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 229 (5th Cir. 2022) (same).  There is \nno doubt some harm to borrowers who are enrolled in the SAVE plan.  This harm, \n-22- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 22      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 27 of 29 PageID #:\n1306\nhowever, is minimized by the fact their loans have been placed in forbearance and \nthey have a preexisting obligation to repay their loans.  Any change in borrowers’ \nexpectations was caused by the likely unlawful agency action challenged here.  See \nSAVE Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 43820, 43822, 43835.  In sum, the concrete, ongoing \nharm to MOHELA exceeds these other harms, weighing these factors in favor of a \npreliminary injunction.   \n \nC.  Scope of Relief \n   \n  Finally, having determined a preliminary injunction is appropriate, we turn to \nthe parties’ dispute over the proper scope of relief.  The district court blocked the \nSAVE Rule’s early forgiveness provision nationwide.  The federal officials request \nwe narrow the district court’s injunction to cover only loans held by MOHELA, \nwhile the states assert we should broaden the injunction to preclude the entire SAVE \nRule and the restoration of the REPAYE forgiveness provisions.  We conclude the \ndistrict court correctly did not limit its injunction to MOHELA but erred by not \npreliminarily enjoining the entire rule and the resurrected REPAYE forgiveness.  \n \n  First, “an injunction limited to the plaintiff States, or even more broadly to \nstudent loans affecting the States, would be impractical and would fail to provide \ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Nebraska, 52 F.4th at 1048.  A servicer-dependent \ninjunction would create chaos and uncertainty for borrowers and be difficult to \nadminister because loan accounts can shift between servicers.  Through a process \ncalled  rebalancing,  the  Department  can  move  student  loan  accounts  from  one \nservicer to another.  A borrower could spend nine years living in Kansas, paying off \nloans thinking he would obtain forgiveness, only to move to Missouri in year ten or \nhave his accounts shifted to MOHELA and no longer be eligible under the federal \nofficials’ preferred approach.  Furthermore, reducing the overall number of existing \nloans by forgiving loans held by other servicers creates the risk that rebalancing \nreduces the accounts held by MOHELA.  With fewer accounts, MOHELA would \nultimately incur the same loss of its servicing fees, albeit indirectly.  A nationwide \n-23- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 23      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 28 of 29 PageID #:\n1307\ninjunction is no more burdensome on the federal officials than necessary and is more \nworkable.  See id. \n \n  Second, we conclude the entire SAVE Rule must be preliminarily enjoined.  \nUpon ultimate success in an Administrative Procedure Act challenge, the default \nremedy is to set aside or vacate the rule.  See Data Mktg. P’ship v. U.S. Dep’t of \nLab., 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th Cir. 2022); United Steel v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., \n925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  In certain circumstances, portions of a rule \ncan be severed if doing so would “not impair the function of the statute as a whole, \nand  there  is no  indication that the  regulation would not  have  passed”  had  the \nunlawful provision not been included.  See K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. \n281, 294 (1988).  Otherwise, the entire rule rises and falls with its challenged \nprovisions.  See Carlson v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, 351 (D.C. Cir. \n2019).  Considering these principles, the default scope of preliminary relief should \napply to the rule as a whole unless the offending provision is severable.   \n \nHere,  the  district  court  enjoined  only  the  forgiveness  provision  after \nconcluding the remainder of the rule “can function sensibly” without forgiveness.  \nWe conclude otherwise.  As the federal officials themselves argue, “it would make \nlittle sense for an ICR plan to end in default,” which is what will happen for most \nborrowers enrolled in SAVE if forgiveness is enjoined while other provisions like \nthe payment provisions remain in effect.  The Secretary’s estimates detail how most \nborrowers repaying under SAVE will not repay even the principal of their loans if \nthey follow the prescribed payment plan.  SAVE Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. at 43880–81.  \nConsequently, if forgiveness is enjoined, those borrowers will default at the end of \nthe payment period unless they are able to pay the entire outstanding balance at once.  \nGiven the repeated references in the SAVE Rule of its aim to avoid default, e.g., id. \nat 43820, 43822–24, 43826, there is strong evidence the regulation would not have \nbeen promulgated in the absence of a forgiveness provision.  Even in the SAVE \nRule’s  discussion  of  how  various  provisions  could  function  independently,  the \nSecretary did not claim she would implement these regulations absent forgiveness \nof loans.  See id. at 43828–29.  The forgiveness provisions undergird the entire \n-24- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 24      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  66     Filed: 02/18/25     Page: 29 of 29 PageID #:\n1308\nSAVE plan and therefore are not severable.  Enjoining forgiveness necessitates \nenjoining the entire rule. \n \n  Finally, we turn to the hybrid rule, which the federal officials implemented \nafter  the  district  court  enjoined  the  SAVE  Rule’s  forgiveness  provisions.  \nEssentially, the federal officials resuscitated the forgiveness provisions of the 2015 \nREPAYE Rule to fill in the gap created after the SAVE Rule’s forgiveness was \nenjoined, relying on it to continue the same, likely unlawful, action the district court \nhad  enjoined.    Generally,  in  the  absence  of  “special  circumstances,”  “prior \nregulations remain valid until replaced by a valid regulation or invalidated by a \ncourt.”  Menorah Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, 768 F.2d 292, 297 (8th Cir. 1985).  Under \nthis  principle,  the  pre-amendment  REPAYE  forgiveness  provision  could  be \nreinstated as the Secretary did here.  However, we find this case presents such special \ncircumstances, namely the portion of the old rule the federal officials seek to revive \nsuffers from the same legal errors as the one challenged here — the Secretary lacks \nthe power to authorize loan forgiveness in an ICR plan.  We therefore conclude the \ndistrict court’s injunction should be broadened to enjoin the Secretary’s attempt to \nforgive loans in the SAVE plan through the old REPAYE provisions.   \n \nIII.  Conclusion \n \n  In sum, we affirm the district court’s entry of a preliminary injunction and \nremand for further proceedings and with instructions to modify the preliminary \ninjunction to enjoin the entire SAVE Rule as well as the hybrid rule.  The injunction \npending appeal imposed by our order of August 9, 2024, will dissolve upon the \ndistrict court’s modification of its injunction.   \n ______________________________ \n \n-25- \n \nAppellate Case: 24-2332     Page: 25      Date Filed: 02/18/2025 Entry ID: 5486384 ",

Yet  again,  the  President  is  unilaterally  trying  to  impose  an  extraordinarily \nexpensive and controversial policy that he could not get through Congress.  This latest attempt to \nsidestep the Constitution is only the most recent instance in a long but troubling pattern of the \nPresident relying on innocuous language from decades-old statutes to impose drastic, costly policy \nchanges on the American people without their consent.   \n2.  The President has attempted this in area after area of the economy, from imposing \nunlawful vaccine mandates across the country, to imposing unlawful and backbreaking regulations \non energy producers, to arrogating for himself the power to prohibit every landlord in the nation \n \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 2 of 62 PageID #: 2\n \nfrom initiating eviction proceedings.  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022); Natl. Fedn. of \nIndep. Bus. v. Dept. of Lab., Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 595 U.S. 109 (2022); \nAlabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485 (2021); see also \nGeorgia v. President of the United States, 46 F.4th 1283 (11th Cir. 2022) (vaccine mandate \nexecutive order exceeded the President’s authority under major questions doctrine); Louisiana v. \nBiden, 55 F.4th 1017 (5th Cir. 2022) (same); Texas v.

He has also done so in express defiance of the Supreme Court.  The eviction-\nmoratorium case provides a good example.  The President unlawfully attempted to impose a \nnationwide eviction moratorium just one month after five justices on the Supreme Court noted that \nthe President lacked legal authority to do so.  Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2488 (stating \nthat four justices voted to block the moratorium in June 2021 and a fifth, while declining to block \nthe moratorium because it was expiring imminently, made clear that “the CDC’s moratorium \nexceeded its statutory authority”).  The President recognized that a majority of the Supreme Court \njustices had already said his eviction moratorium was unlawful and “that lawmakers would need \nto pass legislation to extend the moratorium after a recent Supreme Court decision signaled the \nCDC couldn’t lawfully extend its moratorium again absent congressional authorization,” but the \nPresident imposed the moratorium anyway.  Ackerman, Biden Administration Issues New Eviction \nMoratorium, WSJ (Aug. 3, 2021).1  When he did so, the Supreme Court was forced to block the \n                                                 \n1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-set-to-issue-new-eviction-moratorium-11628022282 \n \n   2 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 3 of 62 PageID #: 3\n \nexecutive action, declaring that the President’s statutory argument “strains credulity.”  Alabama \nAss’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2486. \n4.  His student loans actions are no different.  Just last year, the Supreme Court struck \ndown an attempt by the President to force teachers, truckers, and farmers to pay for the student \nloan debt of other Americans—to the enormous tune of $430 billion.  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. \nCt. 2355, 2362 (2023).  In striking down that attempt, the Court declared that the President cannot \n“unilaterally alter large sections of the American economy.”  Id. at 2375.   \n5.  Undeterred, the President is at it again, even bragging that “the Supreme Court \nblocked it.  They blocked it.  But that didn’t stop me.”2 \n6.  Indeed, just 10 days after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Biden v. \nNebraska, the Federal Government published a rule that seeks to “cancel” an even larger amount \nof student loan debt, forcing American taxpayers to pick up the tab.  The Final Rule is titled \n“Improving Income Driver Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and \nthe Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL Program).”  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820.  A true and correct \ncopy of the Final Rule is attached hereto as Exhibit #1. \n7.  That new rule is the subject of this lawsuit—referred to by Defendants as the \n“SAVE Plan”—and is set to take full effect on July 1, 2024.  \n8.  The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania estimates the economic cost \nof the President’s newest rule at $475 billion across 10 years, $45 billion more than the program \nstruck down by the Supreme Court.

See, e.g., Travis Hornsby, New REPAYE \nPlan Could Save Borrowers Over $1 Trillion Over 10 Years, Student Loan Planner (Dec. 20, \n2023).4 \n9.  The President, in fact, was in such a rush to defy the Supreme Court that the Federal \nGovernment failed to update the Final Rule to account for the Supreme Court’s decision.  Not only \ndoes the rule never cite Biden v. Nebraska, but it even goes so far as to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis on the false assumption that the Supreme Court had upheld the rule, see 88 Fed. Reg. \n43875, when the Supreme Court in fact did the opposite, Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2375.  \nThis alone is arbitrary and capricious, and it is just the tip of the iceberg.   \n10.  The  Federal  Government  admits  that  Congress  created  an  income-driven \nrepayment  system—called  “Income  Based  Repayment”  or  “IBR”—that  statutorily  permits \nstudent-loan cancellation only after a borrower pays 15% of disposable income (defined to be \nincome above 150% of the federal poverty line “FPL”) for up to 25 years.  (The amounts are 10% \nand 20 years for loans taken out after July 1, 2014, and the time is shortened to 10 years for \nindividuals working in public service.)  See 20 U.S. Code §§ 1098e, 1087e(m)(1); 34 C.F.R. \n§§ 682.221(b), 685.219. \n11.  Yet the Federal Government seeks to evade these statutory limits by relying on \npurported authority from older amendments to the HEA, the ICR amendments.  88 Fed. Reg. \n43826–27 (“This statutory language clearly grants the Secretary authority to make the changes in \nthis rule related to the amount of income protected from payments, the amount of income above \nthe income protection threshold that goes toward loan payments, and the amount of time borrowers \n                                                 \n4 https://www.studentloanplanner.com/new-repaye-plan-ten-year-cost/ \n \n   4 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 5 of 62 PageID #: 5\n \nmust pay before repayment ends.”).  The Federal Government seeks to hike the exempt-income \nthreshold from 150% to 225%, slash the payment obligation from 15% to 5% for undergraduates, \nand permit forgiveness after as few as 10 years instead of 25.  \n12.  This rule unlawfully seeks to evade the limits Congress set out in statute for the \nIBR program.  It also would gut the statutory purpose of providing loans.  By their nature, loans \nrequire repayment except in extenuating circumstances.  The Federal Government’s thresholds are \nset so high—arbitrarily so—that it creates a grant for most borrowers.  In other words, unlike every \nother  loan  program,  the  majority  of  borrowers  will  receive  a  grant.    Indeed,  the  Federal \nGovernment bragged in March that the clear majority of individuals on this new plan—57%—are \npaying nothing.  This is not a student loan program.  It is a grant program that Congress never \nauthorized.  \n13.  As Defendant Biden once remarked, “The framers intentionally chose not to create \na parliamentary system of government.   They meant for the President and Congress to be \nindependent of and co-equal with one another.  Maintaining each of those branches as strong and \nindependent is fundamental to the Constitution's very structure--a structure they designed to \nsafeguard the liberty of the governed against abuses of power by those who govern.”  Proceedings \nof the United States Senate in the Impeachment Trial of President William Jefferson Clinton, \nVolume IV: Statements  of  Senators Regarding the Impeachment  Trial of  President William \nJeffreson Clinton, S. Doc. 106-4 (1999).5  By usurping Congressional authority to the tune of \nhundreds of billions of dollars (if not more), and flouting the Supreme Court, Defendants seek to \nstrike a blow to the Constitution’s very structure and centralize power within the executive alone.   \n                                                 \n5 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc4/html/CDOC-106sdoc4-vol4.htm \n \n   5 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 6 of 62 PageID #: 6\n \n14.  The President’s “Plan B” attempt to force taxpayers to pay for the debts of others \nis no stronger than his “Plan A” attempt that was blocked last year.  In fact, just days after Plaintiffs \nannounced they would file this suit, the President announced a Plan C, which his “advisers hope \nto use the rules to begin canceling waves of student debt in the run-up to the November election.”  \nAndrew Restuccia, Biden to Make Second Attempt at Large-Scale Student Loan Forgiveness, WSJ \n(Apr. 5, 2024).6  This Court should speedily put a stop to the President’s unlawful attempt—\nagain—to skirt Congress and the Constitution.   \nTHE PARTIES \n15.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 and Amendments \n37.  The  Higher  Education  Act  of  1965  (“the  HEA”)  was  enacted  “to  increase \neducational opportunities and ‘assist in making available the benefits of postsecondary education \nto eligible students in institutions of higher education.’”  Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2362 (quoting 20 \nU.S.C. § 1070(a) (cleaned up). \n38.  Among  other  things,  the  HEA  provided  for  two  different  forms  of  financial \nassistance: grants and loans.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1070-1070h, § 1071-1087-4. \n39.  Initially, the HEA authorized the Federal Government only to guarantee private \nloans.  20 U.S.C. §§ 1071 et seq.  In 1993, however, Congress amended the HEA to authorize \ndirect loans from the Federal Government to students through the William D. Ford Federal Direct \nLoan Program (“DLP”) and allowed the Department to offer plans for repayment of student loans.  \n20 U.S.C. §§ 1087a et seq.  \n40.  Among the repayment plans authorized by the 1993 amendments was an Income-\nContingent Repayment plan (“ICR”) requiring “repayment of such loan, including principal and \ninterest,” with “varying annual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower, paid over \n \n   9 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 10 of 62 PageID #: 10\n \nan extended period of time prescribed by the Secretary, not to exceed 25 years.”  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D).  Defendants try to invoke this authority to justify their SAVE Plan. \n41.  Unlike statutory authority passed years later for the “Income-Based Repayment” \nprogram, this statute contains no textual authorization for cancelling loans.   \n42.  In 1994, the Department implemented the first income-contingent repayment plan, \nwhich limited annual loan payments to 20% of a borrower’s income in excess of 100% of the \nfederal poverty line.  The Department also, without explicit authorization, established by rule that \nborrowers who had a remaining balance after 25 years of timely payments would have the \nremaining balance forgiven.  See The Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Congressional \nResearch Service, at 15 (1995).7 \n43.  Any  incidental  cancellation  under  that  rule  was  small.    The  Government \nAccountability Office estimated that only nine percent of borrowers participated in ICR.  GAO \nDirect Student Loans: Analysis of Borrowers’ Use of Income Contingent Repayment Option 7 \n(1997).8  And  of  that  subset,  the  Department  estimated  that  only  “approximately  12%  of \n[participating] borrowers would not [fully] repay within the 25-year period.”  Id. at 11.  That meant \nthat, consistent with the statutory purpose of the ICR in obtaining “repayment of such loan, \nincluding principal and interest,” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1), nearly everybody was expected to pay \ntheir loans: only about 1 percent of borrowers received some cancellation of debt.   \n44.  In  2007,  Congress  determined  that  the  income-contingent  program  was  not \nsufficiently protective, so it enacted three significant changes to the HEA.   \n45.  First,  Congress  established  an  updated  program,  called  the  Income-Based \nRepayment  (“IBR”)  plan—which  became  available  in  addition  to  the  income-contingent \n                                                 \n7 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED378875.pdf \n8 https://www.gao.gov/assets/hehs-97-155.pdf \n \n   10 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 11 of 62 PageID #: 11\n \nrepayment plan.  This new program provided relief for borrowers facing a temporary “financial \nhardship” by increasing the exempt-income threshold from 100% of the federal poverty line to \n150% and decreasing the annual repayment cap from 20% to 15% of disposable income.  See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1098e(a)(3)(B), (b)(1).  Eligibility for this program remains only “during any period the \nborrower has the partial financial hardship,” id., as that term is defined in 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(a)(3). \n46.  Second, unlike with the ICR program, Congress included statutory text expressly \ngiving the Department authority to cancel debt.  Id. § 1098e(b)(7).  The Secretary was directed to \n“cancel any outstanding balance” for persons under the IBR program who have met certain \nrequirements, including payment for a period of time “not to exceed 25 years.”  Id.  For the first \ntime, Congress also expressly authorized forgiveness for persons who have “made payments under \nan income-contingent repayment plan,” but only if those borrowers joined the income-based \nrepayment plan.  Id. § 1098e(b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B)(iv) (emphasis added).  The statute does not \ncontain authorization for persons who are on ICR plans only.  \n47.  Third,  the  IBR  program  (unlike  the  ICR  program)  expressly  authorizes  the \nSecretary to subsidize the interest of borrowers—but only for a limited time.  If the amount of a \nborrower’s monthly payment under the program is not sufficient at that time to cover monthly \ninterest, then the Secretary must, “on subsidized loans,” pay the difference between the borrower’s \npayment and the interest due that month.  § 1098e(b)(3).  But the Secretary may do so only during \nthe first 3 years after the borrower elects to participate in the IBR program.  Id.   In contrast, the \nICR provisions expressly permit the Secretary only to “limit[ ] the amount of interest that may be \ncapitalized.”  § 1087e(e)(5).  In other words, borrowers under the ICR program still must pay the \ninterest.  They may simply avoid the interest becoming capitalized into the principal.  \n \n   11 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 12 of 62 PageID #: 12\n \n48.  The  2007  amendments  also  established  the  Public  Service  Loan  Forgiveness \n(“PSLF”) program.  Under the PSLF, the Secretary was granted the authority to “cancel the balance \nof principal and interest” of borrowers who made 120 eligible monthly payments while employed \nin a “public service job.”  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1).  By reducing the statutory amount of time \nto receive forgiveness from 25 years to 10, this program offered a powerful incentive to pursue \npublic service employment. \n49.  The last significant statutory amendments to loan repayment statutes were made in \n2010.  That year, the President urged Congress to pass a “bill” to make IBR more generous by \nlowering the payment cap to 10% (from 15%) of income above 150% of the federal poverty \nguideline and ensure that “debt will be forgiven after 20 years,” down from 25 years under IBR.  \nBarack Obama, Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address at 5 (Jan. 27, 2010).9  The \nPresident did not lay claim to being able to accomplish those changes unilaterally.  Instead, the \nPresident “urge[d] the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill” to that effect.  Id.  \n50.  Congress did so in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 but \nexpressly restricted the amended terms to “new borrower[s] on or after July 1, 2014.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1098e(e). \n51.  While  Congress  has  set  specific  statutory  limits  on  loan  forgiveness,  the \nDepartment has routinely tried to exercise power to lower the eligibility thresholds.  Moreover, the \nDepartment has unilaterally overridden some of these provisions in the rulemaking process to \nmake them higher.  For example: \ni.  In 2012, the Department established the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, which \nretroactively extended the 2010 statutory amendments to loans taken out as far \n                                                 \n9 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-201000055/pdf/DCPD-201000055.pdf \n \n   12 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 13 of 62 PageID #: 13\n \nback as 2007, despite statutory language stating that the amendments should \napply only to loans taken out after July 1, 2014.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 66,088. \nii.  In 2015, the Department established the REPAYE plan, extending the 2010 \namendments to all borrowers regardless of when they took out the loans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 67,204. \n52.  Even with the Department’s changes, the average individual borrower under the \nREPAYE plan would still ultimately pay back more than the amount that they took out in loans.  \n88 Fed Reg. 43,880. \n53.  While  the  HEA  includes  a  variety  of  provisions  allowing  the  secretary  to \npromulgate regulations for income-driven repayment and other repayment programs, no provision \nof the HEA delegates to the Secretary authority to convert a student “loan” program into what is \neffectively a student “grant” program for the majority of borrowers.  By statute, loan forgiveness \nis supposed to be the exception, not the rule—an acknowledgment that writing off bad loans is \nunavoidable in any industry.  Nor does the HEA include authority for the Department to use the \nICR program to evade the statutory limits of the IBR program.  \nB.  Congressional Inaction and Defendants’ Failed Attempt at Mass Cancellation \n54.  Congress has not enacted any substantial amendments to the HEA, or otherwise \npassed laws providing amending the treatment of student debt, since 2010.  But that does not mean \nthat Congress has left the issue un-considered. \n55.  In July 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced the Student Loan Debt Relief \nAct of 2019, a bill that would have automatically canceled $50,000 of student loan debt for those \n \n   13 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 14 of 62 PageID #: 14\n \nwho make under $100,000.  Congress chose not to pass the bill.  See Student Loan Debt Relief Act \nof 2019, S. 2235, 116th Cong. (2019).10 \n56.  In March 2021, Representative Al Lawson introduced the Income-Driven Student \nLoan Forgiveness Act, which would have cancelled the outstanding balance on loans for all \nborrowers under a certain income cap.  See Income-Driven Student Loan Forgiveness Act, H.R. \n2034, 117th Cong. (2021).11  Congress chose not to pass the bill. \n57.  Frustrated by their lack of success in the legislative arena, some members of \nCongress then began to assert that the President could skirt Congress and cancel loans through \nexecutive  action.    In  February  2021,  Senators  Elizabeth  Warren  and  Chuck  Schumer  and \nRepresentatives Alma Adams, Ilhan Omar, and Mondaire Jones introduced resolutions asserting \nthat the Biden Administration has statutory power to cancel student debt immediately.  Elizabeth \nWarren, Warren, Schumer, Pressley, Colleagues: President Biden Can and Should Use Executive \nAction to Cancel up to $50,000 in Federal Student Loan Debt Immediately (Feb. 4, 2021).12 \n58.  But even this unbinding resolution was too controversial to pass.  The Senate \nresolution was signed by 20 members and still failed.

Still,  the  resolutions  had  their  desired  effect.    On  August  24,  2022,  the \nAdministration announced that, under the HEROES Act, it would cancel $10,000 to $20,000 in \nstudent debt for all borrowers who have loans owned by the Department and whose annual income \nwas less than $125,000 (or $250,000 for married borrowers who file jointly).  FACT SHEET: \nPresident Biden Announces Student Loan Relief for Borrowers Who Need It Most, The White \nHouse (Aug. 24, 2022).15   \n60.  The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania released a study concluding \nthat the Department’s Mass Debt Cancellation would cost up to $519 billion over ten years, and \nthe overall cost could rise to more than $1 trillion when factoring in the other components of the \nDepartment’s announcement.  See The Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan: Budgetary Costs \nand Distributional Impact, Penn Wharton University of Pennsylvania (Aug. 26, 2022).16  \n61.  On  September  29,  2022,  six  states—including  Plaintiff  States  Missouri  and \nArkansas  here—sued in federal  court to  block  that unlawful  executive action.   They  were \nsuccessful.   \n62.  In Biden v. Nebraska, the Supreme Court rejected Defendants’ assertion that they \ncould use a vague provision of the HEROES Act as authority to transfer half a trillion dollars in \nwealth from taxpayers to student loan borrowers.  143 S. Ct. 2355. \n63.  In holding that “the HEROES Act provides no authorization for the Secretary’s \nplan,” the Supreme Court also found that “the ‘economic and political significance’ of the \nSecretary’s action is staggering by any measure.”  Id. at 2373 (citing West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697 (2022) (cleaned up)).

The ruling confirmed what the Democratic Speaker of the House had already \nprofessed: “People think that the President of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness.  \nHe does not. . . . That has to be an act of Congress. . . . The President can’t do it.”  See Lauren \nCamera, Pelosi: Biden Lacks Authority to Cancel Student Debt, U.S. News & World Report (July \n28, 2021).17 \nC.  The Proposed Rule \n65.  After the six States sued over the August 2022 rule, the President’s administration \nbegan working feverishly on a Plan B.  On January 11, 2023, just one month after the Supreme \nCourt granted certiorari in Biden v. Nebraska, Defendant Department issued the Proposed Rule, \nentitled, “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Improving IDR for the Direct Loan Program.”  See \n88 Fed. Reg 1894. \n66.  The Proposed Rule was characterized as an effort “to amend the regulations \ngoverning  income-contingent  repayment  plans  by  amending  the  Revised  Pay  as  You  Earn \n(REPAYE) repayment plan, and to restructure and rename the repayment plan regulations under \nthe William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, including combining the Income \nContingent Repayment (ICR) and the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plans under the umbrella \nterm of ‘Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans.’”  Id. \n67.  The Proposed Rule required that any and all comments must be submitted “on or \nbefore February 10, 2023,” id., a mere thirty days later. \n                                                 \n17 https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2021-07-28/pelosi-biden-lacks-authority-to-cancel-\nstudent-debt \n \n   16 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 17 of 62 PageID #: 17\n \n68.  The provisions in the Proposed Rule were “estimated to have a net budget impact \nof $137.9 billion across all loan cohorts through 2032.”  Id. at 1895.  Critically, the Department \narrived at this number only by assuming that the Supreme Court would uphold its August 2022 \nmass cancellation effort.  88 Fed. Reg. 43875. \nD.  Commenting Period for the Proposed Rule \n69.  Despite  the  economic  and  political  significance  of  the  Proposed  Rule,  the \nDepartment denied all requests for extensions beyond the thirty-day period it had originally \nestablished.  Id. at 43821. \n70.  By its nature, the condensed timeline reduced the number of people who could have \notherwise provided valuable comments and prohibited other individuals and entities that ultimately \nsubmitted comments to develop their arguments adequately given the truncated period. \n71.  Despite these limitations, commenters raised concerns about the legal authority of \nthe Department to impose this new rule. \n72.  Specifically, commenters raised concerns that: (1) the Secretary and Department \nwere acting in excess of statutory authority, id. at 43826; (2) the provisions in the Final Rule \nimplicated the major questions doctrine and violated the federal separation of powers, id. at 43830; \nand (3) the provisions in the Final Rule are arbitrary and capricious, id. at 43848, -58. \n73.  Another commenter raised concerns with the Proposed Rules “cost estimates, \nwhich account for the Administration’s onetime debt relief plan to forgive $20,000 for Pell Grant \neligible borrowers and $10,000 for other borrowers,” and  “suggest[ed] that [the Department] \nshould produce a secondary cost estimate in the event that the loan cancellation plan does not go \ninto effect.”  Id. at 43875.  In other words, the commenter noted that if the Supreme Court rejected \n \n   17 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 18 of 62 PageID #: 18\n \nthe President’s August 2022 mass cancellation attempt, the Proposed Rule would artificially \ndiscount the cost estimate by tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars. \n74.  In a March 13, 2023 public letter, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) \nexpressed a belief that the Proposed Rule would cost $230 million.  See Congressional Budget \nOffice, Re: Costs of the Proposed Income-Driven Repayment Plan for Student Loans, (Mar. 13, \n2023).18  The letter also noted that the cost estimate employed by the Department relied on \nassumptions that “there would be no increase in enrollment in the IDR plan among current or \nfuture borrowers[,] no increase in borrowing among eligible students in the future,” and that the \nSupreme Court would rule in its favor in Biden v. Nebraska.  Id. at 2, 7–8.  In the event the Supreme \nCourt ruled against the Department, the CBO found that the cost estimate would increase by \nanother $46 billion in the first year alone.  Id. at 2. \nE.  The Final Rule \n75.  Shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Biden v. Nebraska, Defendant Biden \nreleased a statement calling “the Court’s decision . . . wrong” and promising to “stop at nothing” \nto evade the ruling.  Statement from President Joe Biden on Supreme Court Decision on Student \nLoan Debt Relief, The White House (June 30, 2023).19 \n76.  True to his word, the President’s administration released the Final Rule just 10 days \nafter Biden v. Nebraska, on July 10, 2023.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820. \n77.  Eager to evade the Supreme Court’s ruling as quickly as possible, the President’s \nadministration released the Final Rule without bothering to update any analysis in light of Biden \n                                                 \n18 https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58983-IDR.pdf \n19 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/statement-from-president-joe-biden-\non-supreme-court-decision-on-student-loan-debt-relief/ \n \n   18 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 19 of 62 PageID #: 19\n \nv. Nebraska or amend financial assumptions that were wholly reliant on the administration \nprevailing in that case.  In fact, the Final Rule does not even cite that case.   \n78.  The Final Rule amends 34 C.F.R. §§ 682, 685.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,889–905. \n79.  The Final Rule, except for limited designated provisions, is set to take effect on \nJuly 1, 2024.  88 Fed. Reg. 43820. \n80.  As an initial matter, the Final Rule “rename[s] the REPAYE [plan] as the Saving \non a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan.”  Id. at 43822.  Under the Final Rule, all borrowers on a \n“REPAYE” plan are categorized under the “SAVE” plan.  Id.  Although the “REPAYE” and \n“SAVE” plans are the same under the Final Rule, “the Department [] refer[s] to the SAVE plan as \nREPAYE throughout this final rule.”  Id.  The Final Rule also “combin[es] the Income Contingent \nRepayment (ICR) and the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plans under the umbrella term of \n‘Income-Driven Repayment’ (IDR) plans.”  Id. at 43820. \n81.  The Final Rule makes several significant changes to preexisting regulations: for the \n“REPAYE” or “SAVE” plan, the Final Rule: (1) defines “discretionary income” to be income \nabove 225% of the applicable Federal poverty guideline, up from the current 150%; (2) sets the \nmonthly payment amount at $0 if the borrower’s income falls below that threshold; (3) caps the \nmonthly payment amount at 5% of the borrower’s income that goes above that threshold for \nundergraduate loans, down from the current 10% to 15%; (4) forgives any interest that is not paid \noff each month, despite the statutory limit in the IBR program permitting interest subsidization \nonly for the first 3 years; and (5) accelerates cancellation to as quick as 10 years, even if a borrower \nis not enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  See id. at 43900–05. \n82.  Under the Final Rule, loans are eligible for complete cancellation after 10 years if \nthe original balance was less than $12,000.  The number of years increases for every $1,000 in \n \n   19 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 20 of 62 PageID #: 20\n \noriginal principle balance, so a person with an original principal amount of $13,000 will be eligible \nfor complete cancellation after 11 years.  Id. at 43903.     \n83.  Under authority proscribed by the HEA, see 20 U.S.C. 1089(c)(2), Defendant \nCardona designated certain provisions for “early implementation” in the Final Rule, including: \ni.  “Adjusting the treatment of spousal income in the REPAYE plan for married \nborrowers who file separately as described in § 685.209(e)(1)(i)(A) and (B);” \nii.  “Increasing the income exemption to 225 percent of the applicable poverty \nguideline in the REPAYE plan as described in § 685.209(f);” \niii.  “Not charging accrued interest to the borrower after the borrower’s payment on \nREPAYE is applied as described in § 685.209(h);” \niv.  “Designating in § 685.209(a)(1) that REPAYE may also be referred to as the \nSaving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan;” \nv.  “[C]hanges to the definition of family size for Direct Loan borrowers in IBR, \nICR, PAYE, and REPAYE in § 685.209(a) to exclude the spouse when a \nborrower is married and files a separate tax return;” and \nvi.  “[T]he provision awarding credit toward forgiveness for certain periods of loan \ndeferment  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  July  1,  2024,  as  described  in \n§ 685.209(k)(4).” \nId. at 43820–21.  Defendants used this designation to implement those identified provisions before \nthe July 1, 2024 effective date of the Final Rule. \n84.  The Final Rule emphasizes that the goal of the changes is to help more borrowers \navert delinquency and default as well as the negative consequences associated with those events, \nsee id. at 43280, but not to create a “grant,” see id. at 43832. \n \n   20 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 21 of 62 PageID #: 21\n \n85.  The data within the Final Rule tells a different story.  The Final Rule states that it \nwill apply to a clear majority of borrowers.  Id. at 43823.  And according to the Department’s own \nfigures, the typical undergraduate borrower under this new “SAVE” plan would pay only about \n$6,121 for every $10,000 borrowed.  Id. at 43880.   \n86.  Under the current/pre-Rule “REPAYE” plan, that amount is $10,956 for every \n$10,000 borrowed.  Id.   \n87.  In other words, while the typical borrower under the current plan repays at least as \nmuch as they borrowed, the typical borrower under the new plan will only pay 61% of what they \nborrowed.  Thus, the Final Rule transforms the typical “loan” into a 39% “grant”—without any \nappropriation from Congress for the resulting billions of dollars in additional federal spending. \n88.  In fact, the Final Rule is so forgiving that it would benefit borrowers in every \nquintile of lifetime income.  Id. at 43878.  Undergraduate borrowers with above-median incomes \nwill have the total amounts of their payments across the life of their loans reduced by as much as \n30%.  Id.  Far from a program to help atypical Americans avoid default, this is a program to turn \nloans into grants even for borrowers making more money than most Americans.  \n89.  The Final Rule rejects challenges to the Department’s legal authority by ignoring \nthe entire absence of statutory authority to forgive loans under the ICR program (under which the \nFinal Rule proceeds) and then arguing that the HEA “sets an explicit upper limit, but no lower \nlimit for the ‘extended period’ time that a borrower must spend in repayment” and that the \nSecretary has “discretion as to how much a borrower must pay, specifying only that payments \nmust be set based upon the borrower’s annual adjusted gross income.”  Id. at 43826-27. \n90.  The Final Rule asserts that the Secretary has the “authority to make the changes in \nthis rule related to the amount of income protected from payments, the amount of income above \n \n   21 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 22 of 62 PageID #: 22\n \nthe income protection threshold that goes toward loan payments, and the amount of time borrowers \nmust pay before repayment ends.”  Id. at 43827. \n91.  The Department seems to believe that the only limitation on its authority under the \nHEA is to provide a “reasoned basis for the parameters it chose.” Id. \n92.  The Final Rule does not acknowledge any statutory limiting principle on the \nSecretary’s authority to abolish debts and does not dispute that the Department’s interpretation of \nthe relevant statutes would permit the Department to de facto cancel all student loans. \n93.  The Final Rule expressly states, for example, that the Department believes it could \nexempt even 400% or more of the federal poverty line from income.  The Department simply is \nnot doing so “at this time.”  Id. at 43831.   \n94.  Under this view, there is nothing in the HEA that would prevent the Secretary from \nlimiting  debt  repayment  on  income-contingent  repayment  plans  to:  0.01%  of  income  over \n$1,000,000 for 1 year only, with all remaining debt—typically 100%—cancelled by the Federal \nGovernment. \n95.  The Final Rule brushes off comments that the program was a matter of economic \nsignificance that did not have clear Congressional authorization by stating that there is not anything \n“unprecedented or novel about the Department relying on section 455 of the HEA as statutory \nauthority for designing and administering repayment plans based on income.”  Id. at 43830. \n96.  But by the Department’s own estimates, the Final Rule would abolish extraordinary \namounts of debt and convert loans into grants for the typical borrower.  That is incontestably \nunprecedented and novel—especially when Congress expressly placed statutory limits in place in \nthe IBR program that prohibit the Department from doing the same thing to IBR loans, as the \nDepartment is forced to acknowledge.  See id. at 43851. \n \n   22 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 23 of 62 PageID #: 23\n \n97.  While the Final Rule notes that commenters argued that its provisions are matters \nof economic and political significance that require “clear Congressional authorization,” it includes \nno discussion as to whether the Final Rule was an issue of economic or political significance that \nrequired clear Congressional authorization.  Id. at 43830.  To the contrary, the Final Rule suggests \nthat the Secretary’s power is unlimited unless Congress stops him.  See id. (“Yet Congress has \ntaken no action to limit the Secretary’s discretion . . . .”).  \n98.  It  is  also  uncontestable  that  the  Final  Rule  does  not  accurately  estimate  the \nextraordinary cost of the program.  The Final Rule estimates that the cost of the program would be \n$156 billion across the span of ten years.  Id. at 43820, 43886.  But that estimate is expressly based \non the (false) assumption that the Department would prevail at the Supreme Court in Biden v. \nNebraska.    The  Final  Rule  says  that  the  Department’s  cost  estimates  “account  for  the \nAdministration’s one-time debt relief plan to forgive $20,000 for Pell Grant eligible borrowers and \n$10,000 for other borrowers” and then falsely says “[t]his issue remains before the Supreme Court” \neven though the Supreme Court had already issued its decision rejecting that program 10 days \nearlier.  Id. at 43875; see also id. at 43886 (“This estimate is based on … the August 2022 \nannouncement that the Department will discharge up to $20,000 in Federal student loans for \nborrowers ….”).  Rather than heed the advice by one commenter to create a “cost estimate in the \nevent that the loan cancellation plan does not go into effect,” the Department dismissed the \nsuggestion and stated it was “confident in our authority” on the issue.  Id. at 43875.   \n99.  Unlike the Department, which steadfastly refuses to assess costs after Biden v. \nNebraska, other organizations have assessed the cost of the Final Rule.  Before the Final Rule was \npublished, the CBO informed Congress that, if the administration lost Biden v. Nebraska, the \nDepartment’s Final Rule could cost an additional $46 billion in the first year alone, on top of its \n \n   23 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 24 of 62 PageID #: 24\n \n10-year estimate of $230 billion.  See Congressional Budget Office, Re: Costs of the Proposed \nIncome-Driven Repayment Plan for Student Loans, at 2 (Mar. 13, 2023).20  After the Supreme \nCourt decided Biden v. Nebraska and the Department published the Final Rule, the CBO scored a \njoint resolution that would repeal the Final Rule.  See At a Glance H.J. Res. 88, a joint resolution \nproviding for Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the Department of Education relating to “Improving Income Driven Repayment for \nthe William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan \n(FFEL) Program,” CBO at 1 (Sept. 18, 2023).21  The CBO assessed the 10-year cost of the \nDepartments plan at $260.7 billion.  Id.  That total is $104 billion more than the estimate in the \nFinal Rule. \n100.  The CBO also stated that the actual cost of the Final Rule by itself would be higher, \nbut CBO decided to discount the cost because of anticipated savings provided by a separate rule.  \nId. at 6. \n101.  The CBO also noted that the Department’s estimate was “much lower” than CBO’s \nbecause the “the department’s estimate incorporates the costs of the Administration’s plan to \ncancel up to $20,000 in outstanding balances for eligible borrowers” even though “[t]he Supreme \nCourt invalidated the loan cancellation plan on June 30, 2023.”  Id.  The Department also failed to \n“include any costs for increased borrowing among eligible students in the future.”  Id.  \n102.  Similarly, shortly after the Final Rule was released, the Wharton School of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania published a budget model that found the Final Rule’s would have a net \ncost three times higher than the government projected, coming in at over $475 billion across a 10-\nyear budget, more than the program struck down in Biden v. Nebraska.  See Biden’s New Income-\n                                                 \n20 https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58983-IDR.pdf \n21 https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-09/hjres88.pdf \n \n   24 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 25 of 62 PageID #: 25\n \nDriven Repayment (“SAVE”) Plan: Budgetary Cost Estimate Update, Penn Wharton University \nof Pennsylvania (July 17, 2023).22   \n103.  More recently, commentators estimated that the true costs of the Final Rule could \nexceed one trillion dollars, or more than double the economic impact of the loan-cancellation rule \nthe Supreme Court last year declared illegal, in part because of the total’s “staggering” economic \nsignificance.  See, e.g., Travis Hornsby, New REPAYE Plan Could Save Borrowers Over $1 \nTrillion Over 10 Years, Student Loan Planner (Dec. 20, 2023).23 \nF.  Congressional Inaction on the SAVE Plan \n104.  Perhaps sensing the legal vulnerability with Defendants’ unprecedented actions, \nseveral members of Congress have introduced legislation to codify the SAVE Plan.  A bill was \nintroduced in the House signed by 16 members, and in the Senate signed by 14 members.  See \nCodifying SAVE Plan Act, H.R. 6593, 118th Cong. (2023);24 Gillibrand Announces Legislation \nTo Protect Historic Student Loan Debt Relief; Urges Borrowers To Apply For “SAVE Plan” (Apr. \n2, 2024).25  Neither chamber in Congress has passed this legislation. \nG.  Defendants Rush to Cancel Loans Months Earlier Than Scheduled \n105.  Even though loan cancellation was not supposed to occur under the Final Rule until \nJuly 2024, Defendants decided earlier this year—with almost no notice—to accelerate. \n106.  On January 16, the Department of Education published a half-page notice in the \nFederal Register saying that it would begin implementing early cancellation just 5 days later, on \n                                                 \n22 https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/7/17/biden-income-driven-repayment-budget-update \n23 https://www.studentloanplanner.com/new-repaye-plan-ten-year-cost/ \n24 https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6593 \n25 https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/gillibrand-announces-legislation-to-protect-historic-student-\nloan-debt-relief-urges-borrowers-to-apply-for-save-plan/ \n \n   25 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 26 of 62 PageID #: 26\n \nJanuary 21—despite previously saying Defendants would wait until July.  89 Fed. Reg. 2489.  The \nDepartment provided no explanation for this change in policy.  \n107.  On February 21, 2024, Defendant Biden announced in a “Fact Sheet” that this had \noccurred.  He announced the “approval of $1.2 billion in student debt cancellation for almost \n153,000 borrowers” pursuant to “a SAVE plan policy that provides debt forgiveness to borrowers \nwho have been in repayment after as little as 10 years and took out $12,000 or less in student \nloans.”  FACT SHEET: President Biden Cancels Student Debt for more than 150,000 Student Loan \nBorrowers Ahead of Schedule, The White House (Feb. 21, 2024).26 \n108.  In the same “Fact Sheet,” Defendant Biden boasted that while “[o]riginally planned \nfor July, the Biden-Harris Administration implemented this provision of SAVE and is providing \nrelief to borrowers nearly six months ahead of schedule.”  Id.  \n109.  The “SAVE plan policy” and “provision of SAVE” referenced by Defendant Biden \nis found in the Final Rule at 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(k)(3), which provides that “a borrower receives \nforgiveness if the borrower’s total original principal balance on all loans that are being paid under \nthe [SAVE] plan was less than or equal to $12,000, after the borrower has satisfied 120 monthly \npayments or the equivalent, plus an additional 12 monthly payments or the equivalent over a period \nof at least 1 year for every $1,000 if the total original principal balance is above $12,000.”  88 Fed. \nReg. 43903. \n110.  Section  685.209(k)(3)  was  not  designated  in  the  Final  Rule  for  early \nimplementation.  \n111.  An “Issue Brief” published by White House Counsel of Economic Advisors on \nFebruary 21, 2024, explains that “the full SAVE regulations will go into effect on July 1, 2024, \n                                                 \n26 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-cancels-\nstudent-debt-for-more-than-150000-student-loan-borrowers-ahead-of-schedule/ \n \n   26 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 27 of 62 PageID #: 27\n \nbut the Department of Education has implemented three key benefits already,” and identifies the \nprovisions in Paragraphs 51(i), 51(ii), and 51(iii).  See Issue Brief: The Benefits of SAVE, The \nWhite House Counsel of Economic Advisors (Feb. 21, 2024).27  While the brief notes that “[a]s of \nFebruary 2024, borrowers who borrowed $12,000 or less will receive forgiveness after making the \nequivalent of 10 years of payments,” it provides no justification for the early implementation of \nthis provision.  Id. \nH.  The Final Rule Irreparably Harms Plaintiff \ni.  The Final Rule harms a public instrumentality that services loans in Missouri \n112.  The Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (“MOHELA”) is “a \npublic instrumentality and body corporate” of the State of Missouri that performs “an essential \npublic function” by providing residents access to student loans.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 173.360; see also \nBiden, 143 S. Ct. at 2366. \n113.  Because it is a public instrumentality of Missouri, “harm to MOHELA is also a \nharm to Missouri.”  Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2366.  \n114.  MOHELA’s purpose is to ensure that all eligible post-secondary education students \nin Missouri have access to guaranteed student loans.  Since 2010, MOHELA has provided roughly \n$100 million in funding for college scholarships in the State of Missouri.  As of 2022, MOHELA \n“owns over $1 billion in FFELs”—that is, MOHELA owns asset-backed securities made up of \nstudent loans.  Id. at 2365.  As of 2022, “[i]t also services nearly $150 billion worth of federal \nloans, having been hired by the Department of Education to collect payments and provide customer \nservice to borrowers.”  Id.  “MOHELA receives an administrative fee for each of the five million \nfederal accounts it services, totaling $88.9 million in revenue [in 2022] alone.”  Id.  “Its profits \n                                                 \n27 https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/02/21/issue-brief-the-benefits-of-save/ \n \n   27 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 28 of 62 PageID #: 28\n \nhelp fund education in Missouri: MOHELA has provided $230 million for development projects \nat Missouri colleges and universities and almost $300 million in grants and scholarships for \nMissouri students.” Id.   \n115.  MOHELA is authorized to act as a servicer for student loan debt, see Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 173.385.1(18), and it may use fees and charges from that activity “to pay the costs of the \nauthority,” § 173.385.1(12). \n116.  MOHELA is a servicer for federally held student debt, including Direct Loan \nprogram loans, under contracts with the Education Department.  The amount of federally held \nstudent debt MOHELA services is substantial.  As of June 30, 2023, (the date of the most recent \nfinancial statement) the entity services roughly $344.4 billion in federal direct loans representing \nover 7.8 million accounts, which are primarily DLP loans.  See Financial Statements and Schedule \nof Expenditures of Federal Awards: Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri As \nof and for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 With Reports of Independent Auditors 4, \nMOHELA (2023) (“FY 2023 Financial Statement”).28  Servicing revenue for fiscal year 2023 were \n$279.2 million.  Id. at 4. \n117.  And while much of what MOHELA does is service loans owned by the Federal \nGovernment, MOHELA also owns $874 million of legacy FFELP loans.  Id. at 6, 8.  The entity \ngenerates revenue from those outstanding FFELP loans.  See Financial Statements: Higher \nEducation Loan Authority of the State of Missouri As of and for the Years Ended June 30, 2021 \nand 2020 With Reports of Independent Auditors 7, MOHELA (2021).29 \n118.  Since 2020, MOHELA has greatly expanded the number of loans it services.  While \nthe  organization  now  services  7.8  million  accounts,  in  2020,  it  serviced  just  2.4  million.  \n                                                 \n28 Available at https://www.mohela.com/DL/common/publicInfo/financialStatements.aspx \n29 Id. \n \n   28 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 29 of 62 PageID #: 29\n \nMOHELA, Letter to Senators Warren, Blumenthal, Van Hollen, Markey, Brown, and Menendez \nat 2 (Aug. 8, 2023).30 \n119.  “The majority of the increase was net direct loan servicing fees.”  FY 2023 \nFinancial Statement at 4.  But part of that increase comes from MOHELA obtaining status as the \nsole servicer of all PSLF loans.  Id.  In 2022, the Federal Government “completed [a] transfer of \nall PSLF borrowers from FedLoan Servicing to MOHELA.”  Federal Student Aid, Department of \nEducation, Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program Transitioning from FedLoan Servicing to \nMOHELA (Dec. 14, 2022).31  Borrowers interested in PSLF are directed to seek loan consolidation, \nwhich would create a “new loan [that] will be sent to MOHELA for general servicing.”  Id.  \n120.  MOHELA faces the imminent loss of revenue in its role as a servicer of loans \nowned by the Federal Government.  MOHELA’s revenue as a servicer of those loans is a function \nof the number of accounts it services.  “MOHELA receives an administrative fee for each of the \nfive million federal accounts it services”—now 7.7 million loans.  See Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2366.  \nThe Supreme Court determined that MOHELA suffers financial harm whenever loans that it \nservices are discharged.  Id.  So when student loan balances go to zero, as they will under the Final \nRule, MOHELA will lose the revenue from servicing those loans.  Thus, by accelerating the \nforgiveness timeline for the typical borrower by as much as 15 years, the Final Rule imposes \nfinancial harm on MOHELA, and thus the State of Missouri, by depriving MOHELA of up to 15 \nyears in servicing fees.   \n121.  MOHELA also faces past loss and imminent future loss of revenue in its role as \nowner or holder of loans—specifically, legacy FFELP loans.  Unlike the current loan program, \n                                                 \n30 https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Servicers%20Responses.pdf#page=43 \n31 https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2022-06-03/public-service-loan-\nforgiveness-program-transitioning-fedloan-servicing-mohela-updated-dec-14-2022 \n \n   29 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 30 of 62 PageID #: 30\n \nwhere the Federal Government owns and issues loans, FFELP loans were commonly issued by \nprivate lenders and commercially owned.  As of MOHELA’s most recent financial statement, it \nowns $874 million in outstanding FFELP loans.   \n122.  But the Final Rule drastically reduces the value of those assets by providing \nborrowers an enormous incentive to consolidate FFELP loans into loans owned by the government \nand  eligible  for  the  new  cancellation  plan.    The  Federal  Government  is  even  permitting \nconsolidation of FFELP loans ineligible for consolidation and is, for the first time ever, conferring \nbenefits retroactively so that forgiveness arrives sooner.  Before the Final Rule, consolidated loans \nhad always been considered new loans, with the clock for forgiveness beginning at the time of \nconsolidation.  Now, Defendants are permitting borrowers to consolidate loans into new loans and \nimmediately shave off  years  from  forgiveness.  This  dramatically encourages borrowers to \nconsolidate their FFELP loans into Defendants’ new plan.  \n123.  The Federal Government in fact expressly tells borrowers to do so.  E.g., Federal \nStudent Aid, Department of Education, What to Know About Federal Family Education Loan \n(FFEL) Program Loans (last visited April 4, 2024)32 (encouraging borrowers to consolidate \nbecause “if your loan isn’t held by ED [Department of Education], you won’t be able to qualify \nfor some federal student loan relief programs unless you consolidate into a Direct Consolidation \nLoan”); Federal Student Aid, Department of Education, Which Federal Student Loans Qualify for \nthe Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan? (last visited April 4, 2024)33 (“FFEL Program \nloans and Perkins Loans are not eligible for this plan but can become eligible through loan \nconsolidation.”). \n                                                 \n32 https://studentaid.gov/articles/what-to-know-about-ffel-loans/ \n33 https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/federal-student-loan-qualifications-for-repaye-plan \n \n   30 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 31 of 62 PageID #: 31\n \n124.  By making consolidation of FFELP loans much more likely, the Final Rule harms \nMOHELA with respect to the loans it owns in several ways.   \n125.  First, if a borrower consolidates a FFELP loan to take advantage of the SAVE Plan, \nMOHELA will no longer own that loan.  MOHELA will thus lose its ability to earn interest income \ngenerated by the FFELP assets that it owned.   \n126.  Second, MOHELA will lose the ability to service most of these loans.  Because \nMOHELA is a smaller participant in the servicing industry, it is allocated only a minority \npercentage of all direct loans to service.  Even if MOHELA were able to service every consolidated \nloan, the service fee is less than the interest income MOHELA would otherwise earn. \n127.  Third, the SAVE Plan makes it much less likely that a borrower will pay off a \nFFELP loan in full.  Many borrowers will instead consolidate.  That decreases the expected return \non investment for owners of FFELP loans and thus decreases the value for selling those loans on \nthe tradeable market.   \n128.  The  Final  Rule  impairs  MOHELA’s  ability  to  provide  services  to  Missouri \nresidents, and harms Missouri’s interest in ensuring its citizens receive an education.  See Mo. \nConst. art. IX, § 9(b) (“The general assembly shall adequately maintain the state university and \nsuch other educational institutions as it may deem necessary.”). \nii.  The Final Rule impairs the ability of public-service employers to recruit\n  employees \n129.  The Final Rule also injures all Plaintiff States’ interests in recruiting and retaining \nemployees.  \n130.  For example, the Final Rule harms Missouri’s interest in hiring and retaining \nemployees across state and local government who use PSLF program for undergraduate and \ngraduate student loans.  Missouri relies upon a robust and dedicated public workforce.  As a matter \n \n   31 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 32 of 62 PageID #: 32\n \nof statute, and the reality of public budgets, the State cannot always offer salaries on par with that \nof private employers around the state.  To bridge the gap and make public employment more \nattractive, the State of Missouri and its political subdivisions, as employers, rely on the PSLF to \nrecruit and retain employees who would otherwise seek private employment but for the benefits \nof the PSLF program.   \n131.  The  Missouri  Attorney  General’s  Office  (“AGO”)  heavily  emphasizes  PSLF \nbenefits when recruiting employees.  See Declaration of Rachael Houser ¶¶ 5–7 (“Houser Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit #4.  The Office tells potential recruits this information at “career fairs” \nand “in interviews with potential employees.”  Id. ¶ 5.  “[A]t every single one” of the Office’s ten \nrecruiting events each year, “students have asked about whether the AGO is a qualifying employer \nfor PSLF.”  Id.  The program is so popular that, of the 13 law school graduates hired by the Office \nlast year, “[a]lmost every one of these attorneys indicated that their decision to work for the AGO \nwas informed, in part, due to the fact that employees in the public sector are eligible for PSLF.”  \nId.  AGO employees commonly are “attracted to public service . . . because of the rewarding and \nvaluable work,” but it is much easier for them to accept much lower salaries by the availability of \n“eventual public-service loan forgiveness.”  See Declaration of Jason Lewis ¶ 14 (“Lewis Decl.”), \nattached hereto as Exhibit #2. \n132.  Part of what makes the program so valuable is that it is comparatively much more \ngenerous than other repayment programs.  “[I]f programs were rolled out that would have reduced \nmy lower monthly payments or allowed my loans to be forgiven earlier, it would have been less \nlikely that I would have chosen to advance my career in public service and the AGO.”  Id. ¶ 17; \nsee also id. ¶ 22 (“If my monthly student loan payments were reduced significantly enough without \n \n   32 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 33 of 62 PageID #: 33\n \nneeding to work in qualifying public service employment, then there would also be less financial \nreason for me to continue employment with the AGO or public service more generally.”). \n133.  The program is also valuable for retaining employees.  “In the last 18 months, 2 \nattorneys in the labor division completed their PSLF requirements, and quickly left the AGO for \njobs that pay substantially more.  These attorneys stayed with the AGO for 10 years in pursuit of \nPSLF, and would otherwise have left much sooner.  An employee leaving the office after satisfying \nPSLF often tells the office they stayed only because of PSLF.”  Houser Decl. ¶ 8.  “Another \nattorney in the labor division was seeking new career opportunities, but limited her job search to \nother public sector employers because she was only 3 years away from PSLF, and its benefits far \noutweighed the higher salaries available to her in the private sector.  This attorney had determined \nthat the benefits of PLSF meant that she would rather continue working in the public sector than \nseek private employment.”  Id. ¶ 9.  PSLF becomes especially valuable the longer a person stays \nin public service because forgiveness grows nearer.  Lewis Decl. ¶ 16 (PSLF “has been critical to \nmy decision to continue to work in public service”).  \n134.  PSLF is so important for government agencies because, before the Final Rule, \nPSLF was comparatively much more generous than any other federal loan repayment program.  \nThat gave borrowers a sizeable incentive to work for public service employers.  Borrowers in the \nprogram could receive loan forgiveness after just 10 years rather than the 25 years under the other \nprograms.  In addition, PSLF borrowers do not face tax liability on the amount forgiven, unlike \nborrowers under other programs.  In exchange for these generous benefits, borrowers make a \ncommitment to work for public service organizations, such as state or local governments and \nagencies.    \n \n   33 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 34 of 62 PageID #: 34\n \n135.  Once the Final Rule takes effect, however, PSLF will not be nearly as attractive \ncompared to other income-driven repayment programs.  Its comparative advantage will shrink or \ndisappear entirely.  Under the SAVE Plan, most individuals on an income-contingent repayment \nplan will have monthly payments that equal $0 per month.  Other individuals with $12,000 or less \nin loans will have them forgiven after ten years of repayment—the same amount of time required \nfor public service loan forgiveness.  And because of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, \nindividuals who receive accelerated loan forgiveness through a program outside PSLF before 2026 \nwill be exempt from tax liability for the amount forgiven. \n136.  All these factors make PSLF much less attractive.  Because many borrowers will \nno longer need PSLF to obtain accelerated loan forgiveness and to obtain a tax exemption on the \namount of loans forgiven, those borrowers will be unlikely to commit themselves to the PSLF \nprogram.  The same is true even for borrowers who will not receive substantial accelerated \nforgiveness.  Because the repayment on a typical loan under the SAVE Plan is so much less than \nprevious plans, many borrowers will choose to accept that plan rather than limit their employment \noptions to public service for the next 10 years.  Fewer borrowers will enter the PSLF program, and \nmany in the program will leave their jobs because the program no longer carries the comparative \nbenefits it once did.  \n137.  The Final Rule impairs Missouri’s interests by discharging the debt held by public \nemployees, harming the ability of the State and its political subdivisions to recruit and retain \nemployees.  See, e.g., Louisiana Energy & Power Auth. v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364, 367 (D.C. Cir. \n1998) (A party “suffer[s] constitutional injury in fact when agencies lift regulatory restrictions on \ntheir competitors or otherwise allow increased competition” against them). \n \n   34 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 35 of 62 PageID #: 35\n \n138.  The same is true for Arkansas.  The challenged rule will impair and hamper \nArkansas’s ability to recruit and retain employees with educational debt.  Like many public sector \nemployers, Arkansas’s state agencies, constitutional offices, and various political subdivisions \ntypically cannot offer compensation on par with private sector employers.  As a result, Arkansas’s \nstate agencies, constitutional offices, and various political subdivisions rely upon the public sector \nstudent loan forgiveness program to help attract and retain talent.  By waiving away undergraduate \nand graduate debt, the challenged rule will weaken that incentive and make it more difficult for \nArkansas to fill public sector jobs. \n139.  For instance, the Office of the Arkansas Attorney General currently relies upon the \npublic sector student loan forgiveness program to attract and retain legal talent.  Many of the \noffice’s current employees participate in that program to obtain relief for undergraduate and \ngraduate loans, and potential employees consider that program in evaluating whether to accept \npublic sector employment.  Indeed, that is particularly true for lawyers, who often incur substantial \ndebts.   \n140.  PSLF is an important recruitment and retention tool for Arkansas.  “The Arkansas \nAttorney General’s Office actively advertises its participation in the PSLF program on its website \nto attract potential applications for employment.”  See Declaration of Dawnetta Calhoun ¶ 8 \n(“Calhoun Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit #3.  “The State of Arkansas also advertises the \nparticipation of state agencies in the PSLF program on its websites to attract potential employees.”  \nId.  Currently, 23 out of 159 employees rely on the program.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 12.  Other current employees \nhave participated in the program, as have past employees.  Id.  \n141.  “A reduction in student loan obligations otherwise eligible for relief under the PSLF \nprogram will make participation in that program less attractive to current and potential employees. \n \n   35 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 36 of 62 PageID #: 36\n \nThus, if the published rule takes effect, the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office will lose a valuable \ntool for recruiting potential  employees and retaining existing employees because the PSLF \nprogram will no longer carry the same comparative benefit that it once did.”  Id. ¶ 13.  \n142.  The challenged rule’s blanket forgiveness waters down the PSLF incentive, makes \npublic sector employment less attractive, and will make it more difficult for the office to retain and \nattract legal talent.  \n143.  Indeed, recognizing the importance of the public sector student loan forgiveness \nprogram to attracting and retaining employees, Arkansas does not tax debt forgiven pursuant to \nthe public sector student loan forgiveness program.  See Ark. Code Ann. 26-51-404(b)(10).  That \ncontrasts with cancellation pursuant to other federal programs and statutes—including cancellation \npursuant to the challenged rule.  See Ark. Code Ann. 26-51-404(a)(1)(E). \n144.  Arkansas likewise faces financial harm.  As detailed above, Arkansas currently \nrelies upon the public sector student loan forgiveness program to attract and retain employees.  \nEmployees and potential employees consider that forgiveness in calculating overall compensation.  \nAbsent that financial incentive, Arkansas will have to increase other forms of compensation to \nattract and retain employees.  Those additional expenses will reduce Arkansas’s ability to fund \nother state expenses and programs. \n145.  For similar reasons to the above,  Florida, Georgia,  North Dakota, Ohio, and \nOklahoma are also harmed by the Final Rule.  \n146.  For example, the State of Florida relies on public sector loan forgiveness to recruit \nemployees.  In general, Florida’s state agencies do not offer compensation at the same level as \nprivate employers, and the prospect of public sector loan forgiveness is an important tool to recruit \n \n   36 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 37 of 62 PageID #: 37\n \nand retain qualified employees. By removing the need for such programs, the challenged rule \nimpairs Florida’s ability to recruit top talent to serve the people of the State of Florida.   \n147.  The Office of the Florida Attorney General relies on public sector loan forgiveness \nas a recruiting tool.  See, e.g., John R. Justice Grant Program, Florida Attorney General’s Office \n(last visited April 5, 2024) (providing information on grant programs available to public sector \nattorneys).34  The availability of such programs is particularly important for employees like \nlawyers who may have debt incurred from both graduate and undergraduate degrees. \n148.  Similarly, for the State of Ohio, public sector loan forgiveness has a significant, \npositive impact on recruitment and retention efforts.  In general, Ohio state agencies do not always \noffer compensation at the same level as private employers, and the prospect of public sector loan \nforgiveness is an important tool to recruit and retain qualified employees.  See, e.g., Why Work for \nThe State of Ohio, Education and Development (last visited April 5, 2024)35 (“Working for the \nstate government gives employees the unique opportunity to apply for student loan forgiveness \nafter making 10 years of qualifying payment while working for the state government.”).  Such \nprograms are particularly important for employees like lawyers who may have incurred student \ndebt from both graduate and undergraduate degrees. \n149.  Indeed, Ohio law generally does not tax student loan debt that has been forgiven.  \nSee Income – General Information, Does Ohio Tax Student Loan Debt That Has Been Forgiven? \n(last visited April 5, 2024).36  By removing the comparative advantages for public sector loan \nforgiveness programs, the challenged rule impairs Ohio’s ability to recruit top talent to serve the \nPeople of the State of Ohio.   \n                                                 \n34 https://www.myfloridalegal.com/home-page/john-r-justice-grant-program  \n35 https://careers.ohio.gov/why-work-for-state-of-ohio/education-and-development/03-education-and-development \n36 https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/tax.ohio.gov/documents/studenloan.pdf \n \n   37 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 38 of 62 PageID #: 38\n \niii.  The Final Rule Harms State Revenue \n150.  Missouri will face financial harm from the Final Rule.  Under Missouri tax law, an \nindividual’s taxable state income is based on their federal adjusted gross income (“AGI”) as a \nbaseline.  See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 143.121.  While the federal AGI normally includes student loan \ndischarge, see 26 U.S.C. § 61(a)(11), that input was removed under the American Rescue Plan Act \nof 2021 for student loan debt discharged before January 1, 2026, see 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5).  Thus, \nthe student loan debts that will receive accelerated forgiveness under Final Rule and be forgiven \nbefore 2026 will not be considered taxable income under Missouri law.  This will reduce the State’s \ntax revenues until 2026. \n151.  Specifically, under the plans in existence before the Final Rule, the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) estimated that by 2030, “about 1.5 million loans held by about \n600,000 borrowers” would be eligible for loan cancellation.  Federal Student Aid: Education \nNeeds to Take Steps to Ensure Eligible Loans Receive Income-Driven Repayment Forgiveness 15, \nU.S. Gov’t Accountability Office (Mar. 2022).37  Of those loans, just 0.3 million would be forgiven \nbefore 2026.  See id. at 16 fig. 3. \n152.  But for the Final Rule, significant numbers of federal loan cancellations would \noccur after 2026 for residents of Missouri and would result in taxable income being recognized \nfrom the loan forgiveness and thus increased payments of income taxes to Missouri. \n153.  The Final Rule’s income and payment threshold numbers make the harm from early \ncancellation even worse.  By increasing the income exemption to 225% and decreasing the \npayment amount to 5%, the unpaid loan balances will be even higher through 2025, meaning \nMissouri and similar States will lose out on even more taxation revenue.  \n                                                 \n37 https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-103720.pdf \n \n   38 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 39 of 62 PageID #: 39\n \n154.  The challenged Final Rule, however, will reduce that tax revenue by accelerating \nsome debt forgiveness that would otherwise occur in a period in which it would be taxable income \n(i.e., 2026 and on) into a period where it is not taxable (i.e., through December 31, 2025).  As a \nresult, the Defendants’ actions will reduce Plaintiff Missouri’s tax revenue. \n155.  Missouri also faces a separate sovereign injury from the Final Rule, as a result of \nhaving to either accept the lost tax revenues identified above or change state tax law for the \ndetermination of an individual’s taxable state income. \n156.  Most other Plaintiff States will likewise face similar sovereign and financial harm \nfrom the rule.  For example, under Georgia and Oklahoma tax law (like under Missouri law), an \nindividual’s taxable state income is based on adjustments to their federal AGI.  See O.C.G.A. § 48-\n7-27(a); OKLA. STAT. tit. 68, §§ 2353, 2358.  \niv.  The Final Rule Directly Harms the Business of the State of North Dakota \n157.  The State of North Dakota is engaged in the business of banking “[f]or the purpose \nof encouraging and promoting agriculture, commerce, and industry.”  N.D.C.C. § 6-09-01.  For \nthat purpose, North Dakota “maintain[s] a system of banking owned, controlled, and operated by \nit, under the name of the Bank of North Dakota.”  Id. \n158.  In this capacity, the Bank of North Dakota funds and administers a state-sponsored \nstudent loan program and a student loan consolidation program.  See N.D.C.C. ch. 15-62.1.  The \nBank of North Dakota’s student loan offerings include the “Dakota Education Alternative Loan” \nor “DEAL” program for eligible borrowers attending institutions of higher education in North \nDakota.  See Bank of North Dakota, DEAL Student Loan (last visited Apr. 8, 2024).38  Interest \n                                                 \n38 https://bnd.nd.gov/education-funding/apply-for-student-loan/deal-student-loan/ \n \n   39 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 40 of 62 PageID #: 40\n \nearned by the Bank of North Dakota from student loans is used to implement, maintain, and \nadminister state programs.  See N.D.C.C. §§ 15-62.1-01; 15-62.1-05. \n159.  Student loan recipients that received or consolidated their student loans through the \nBank of North Dakota will not be eligible to have their loans absolved under the Final Rule.  \nConsequently, despite the convenience of the Bank of North Dakota working directly with in-state \npost-secondary institutions, the Final Rule will foreseeably cause many would-be student loan \nborrowers to forego borrowing from the Bank of North Dakota in the future if loans issued by the \nfederal government may systematically not require repayment under their terms, if at all.  \n160.  Since the Bank of North Dakota’s student loan program is the State of North Dakota \nengaged in business, harms to the Bank of North Dakota or its student loan programs are direct \nharms to the State of North Dakota itself.  See Louisiana Energy & Power Auth. v. FERC, 141 \nF.3d 364, 367 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (a party “suffer[s] constitutional injury in fact when agencies lift \nregulatory restrictions on their competitors”). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I – Violation of Administrative Procedures Act \nAgency Action in Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction and in Violation of Separation of Powers  \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 1 \n \nMajor Questions Doctrine \n \n161.  Plaintiffs re-allege all the above paragraphs as if fully set out herein. \n162.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law; (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (C) in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; [or] (D) without \nobservance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n163.  The Department is an “agency” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(1). \n \n   40 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 41 of 62 PageID #: 41\n \n164.  The Final Rule is a “rule[]” under the APA.  Id. § 701(b)(2). \n165.  The Final Rule is final agency action subject to judicial review.  Id. § 704. \n166.  Separation-of-powers principles prohibit an agency from deciding an issue of great \neconomic or political significance, or issues traditionally governed by state or local law, absent \nclear authorization from Congress to do so, under what Courts have recognized as the “major \nquestions doctrine.”  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 724 (discussing the “major questions doctrine”). \n167.  The major questions doctrine is triggered when an agency attempts to seize broad \nauthority over matters of great economic and political significance.  See id. at 721-22. \n168.  The Final Rule concerns matters of vast political significance and salience because \nits provisions and outcomes relate to issues subject to earnest and profound debate in the American \nbody politic for several decades where Congress has actively legislated.  See Ian Krietzberg, Key \nevents on the path to student loan forgiveness, from Occupy Wall Street to the 2020 presidential \nprimaries, CNBC (Aug. 24, 2022);39 see also Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2374 (“A decision of such \nmagnitude and consequence on a matter of earnest and profound debate across the country must \nrest with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative \nbody.”) (citing West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 735) (cleaned up). \n169.  The Final Rule also concerns matters of great economic significance because the \nnet updated cost of its provisions are projected to be at least $475 billion over a ten-year period, \nand maybe over $1.1 trillion according to some estimates.  That is more than the $430 billion at \nissue in Biden v. Nebraska.  Even under the Department’s calculation of $156 billion—which is \npatently arbitrary because the calculation assumed the Department would prevail in Biden v. \nNebraska even though the Department had already lost—that number is still sufficient to trigger \n                                                 \n39 https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/timeline-key-events-on-the-path-to-student-loan-forgiveness.html \n \n   41 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 42 of 62 PageID #: 42\n \nthe major questions doctrine.  See Alabama Ass'n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 ($50 billion \ntriggered major questions doctrine).  Nothing in the HEA nor its amendments give the Department \nof Education clear authorization to unilaterally spend between $475 billion and $1.1 trillion. \n170.  Moreover, departure from longstanding practice without new authorization from \nCongress is strong evidence the agency is acting without Congressional authorization.  See Nat’l \nFed’n Indp. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). \n171.  The Final Rule departs from the Department’s nearly thirty-year definition of \n“income contingent repayment plan” by effectively turning a repayment plan into a grant for the \ntypical borrower.  Nothing in the HEA and its amendments gives the Department of Education the \nauthority to resolve this debate by turning the terms of income-contingent loan repayment into a \ngrant.  The Final Rule’s suggestion that the Secretary’s authority on these plans is unlimited unless \nCongress acts to stop him has it exactly backward. \n172.  In addition, the Department has never once attempted to use rulemaking authority \nto use the ICR program to subsidize interest.  \n173.  Nor has the Department ever sought to use its authority to permit forgiveness sooner \nthan 20 years—which is the statutory term of years created for forgiveness by the IBR program.  \n20 U.S.C. 1098e(e).  \n174.  The Final Rule triggers the major questions doctrine and violates principles of \nseparation-of power by seizing broad authority over matters of great economic and political \nsignificance without clear congressional authorization. \n175.  Even if the Final Rule does not implicate the major questions doctrine, it still \nviolates separation of powers.  Congress only gave the Department authority to cancel student \n \n   42 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 43 of 62 PageID #: 43\n \nloans in very “limited circumstances.”  See Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2362–63.  As the Supreme Court \nput it last year, the Department may only cancel loans held by: \ni.  “some public servants … who work in their professions for a minimum number \nof years;” \nii.  “borrowers who have died or been ‘permanently and totally disabled;’” \niii.  “[b]ankrupt borrowers;” or \niv.  “borrowers falsely certified by their schools, borrowers whose schools close \ndown, and borrowers whose schools fail to pay loan proceeds they owe to \nlenders.”  Id.  \n176.  And while Congress is no doubt aware of the issue, it has chosen not to rewrite the \nHEA by adding a new category of loan forgiveness as the Department has unilaterally done.  By \ndoing so unilaterally, Defendants have “seiz[ed] the power of the Legislature.”  Id. at 2373.  \n177.  Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would accomplish this, see, \ne.g., Affordable Loans for Any Student Act, S.R. 3953, 117th Cong. (2022);40 Student Loan \nBorrowers’ Bill of Rights Act of 2019, H.R. 3027, 116th Cong. (2019),41 but that legislation did \nnot become law. \n178.  The Department therefore has no authorization to forgive student loans in this \ncontext, and the Department exceeded its authority when it issued the Final Rule.  Because the \nFinal Rule violates separation of powers, it should be set aside. \nCOUNT II – Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act \nAgency Action That Is In Excess of Statutory Authority (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n179.  Plaintiffs re-allege all the above paragraphs as if fully set out herein. \n                                                 \n40 https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3953 \n41 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3027 \n \n   43 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 44 of 62 PageID #: 44\n \n180.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) . . . not in accordance with law; . . . [or] (C) in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n181.  The Final Rule is contrary to law and exceeds the Department’s statutory authority. \n182.  First, the HEA does not authorize the Defendants to create a broad-based grant \nprogram or permit loan forgiveness outside the context of the IBR program.  The HEA and its \namendments separate grants and loans into separate chapters.  The income-contingent repayment \nplan is in the chapter that addresses loans and anticipates actual repayment of the principal and \ninterest borrowed.   \n183.  While Defendants have some discretion in setting the terms of loan repayment \nunder the statute and there are circumstances where someone on this program might pay less than \nthey would otherwise owe, the broad nature of the Department’s actions in the Final Rule make it \nso that the typical undergraduate borrower only repays $6,121, including interest, for every \n$10,000 borrowed.  \n184.  Further, more than half the participants currently enrolled in the plan are expected \nto pay nothing. \n185.  At this point, the loan is at least a partial or full grant because most borrowers will \npay back significantly less than the principal they borrowed, and will be freed from their interest \nobligations.  \n186.  Congress already spoke in a separate chapter of the HEA and its amendments about \nwhat qualifies as a grant.  There is no authority for the proposition that Congress intended to turn \nthe terms of a loan into a grant. \n \n   44 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 45 of 62 PageID #: 45\n \n187.  Second, the HEA does not authorize Defendants to reduce the extended payment \nterm to ten years.  The HEA states that the standard term of loan repayment is ten years.  The \nstatute that authorizes income-driven repayment plan requires payment to occur over a period of \ntime that is “extended” beyond the standard repayment period.  20 U.S.C. §1087e(d)(1)(D).  Yet \nthe Final Rule allows borrowers to have their loans canceled after only ten years, the same amount \nof time as the standard repayment plan.  \n188.  This erases any meaningful difference between a standard repayment plan and an \nextended repayment plan because an extended repayment plan necessarily envisions a longer \nrepayment period than the standard repayment plan. \n189.  Third, the HEA does not authorize Defendants to completely nullify repayment \nlimits set by Congress.  When Congress created the IBR program, Congress statutorily defined the \nterms of repayment for someone facing financial hardship as payments capped at 10% of income \nabove 150% of the federal poverty line over the course of 20 years.  Congress also statutorily \nauthorized the Secretary to subsidize interest for these financial hardship borrowers, but only “for \na period of not more than 3 years.”  20 U.S. Code § 1098e(b)(3).   \n190.  The Final Rule evades these limits without statutory authority.  The ICR program—\nwhich is the authority the Secretary attempts to rely on here—does not include any authorization \nto cancel loans.  Congress knows how to authorize forgiveness and expressly did so in the IBR \nprogram.  “When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nfrom a neighbor, we normally understand that difference in language to convey a difference in \nmeaning.”  Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023).  Here, Congress expressly included \nforgiveness in the income-based repayment section of the Higher Education Act but excluded it \n \n   45 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 46 of 62 PageID #: 46\n \nfrom the income-contingent repayment section—the section the Secretary purports to rely on for \nauthority. \n191.  The Secretary is trying to use the ICR program to skirt the limits Congress placed \nin the IBR program.  The Final Rule would render the IBR limits pure surplusage.  The Secretary \ncannot use ICR authority to cancel loans at all, but at the very least, the Secretary cannot \npromulgate rules under the ICR program that are more forgiving than the statutorily promulgated \nlimits in the IBR program.  \n192.  Congress has already given Defendants limited ability to “waive” FFELP loans.  \nSee 20 U.S.C.§ 1082(a)(6).  This provision shows the limits of what Congress authorized the \nSecretary to do with respect to “waiving” student loans.  Defendants disclaim reliance on this \nprovision.  88 Fed. Reg. 43,834.  By cancelling loan debt on a mass basis through the income-\ndriven loan repayment plan, Defendants are sidestepping those limits and flouting their statutory \nauthority. \n193.  Fourth, the HEA did not authorize Defendants to create new 10-year repayment \nplans.  Congress only provided one avenue where a borrower can receive loan forgiveness after \nten years of repayment: the PSLF program.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1).  The timeline for that \nprogram is defined in statute as 10 years.  The Final Rule renders this program pure surplusage for \na substantial proportion of borrowers.  \n194.  Debates  surrounding  the  bill  that  authorized  public  service  loan  forgiveness \nemphasized the importance of forgiving loans through this program because of the need to gear \nspecific relief for those who pursue a career in public service.  See H.R. Rep. No. 110–210 at 48–\n49 (2007) (“the Committee is concerned with the growing number of individuals who do not \nchoose to enter into lower paying professions, such as public service . . . . To further encourage \n \n   46 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 47 of 62 PageID #: 47\n \npublic service, the legislation includes revisions to the Direct Loan Income Contingent Repayment \nprogram.  Individuals who choose public service will have the option to have their loans forgiven \nafter 10 years if payments are made during that time period.”) \n195.  This Final Rule provides forgiveness after ten years for anyone who has an original \nbalance of $12,000 or less.  In fact, the Department has already retroactively forgiven hundreds of \nthousands of such loans regardless of the amount of interest accumulated on the principle balance. \n196.  There is no authority for the proposition that anyone—regardless of career, income, \nor  even  unemployment—would  have  the  same  timeline  for  loan  forgiveness  as  those  who \ndedicated a decade of their career to public service. \n197.  Fifth, the HEA did not authorize the Defendants to establish a repayment plan with \na payment threshold at 5% of discretionary income above 225% of the federal poverty guidelines.  \nIn its 2012 Final Rule, the Department provided that the changes to Pay As You Earn (“PAYE”) \nplan payment thresholds “will be consistent with the statutory changes to IBR.”  77 Fed. Reg. \n66116.  During the comment period for that same rule, commenters requested that the Department \n“[r]educ[e] the maximum IBR payment amount to five percent of adjusted gross income.”  Id. at \n66099.  The 2012 Final Rule responds that “[t]he Department does not have the authority to change \nthis statutory provision.”  Id. at 66100.  The 2012 Final Rule did not reduce the IBR or PAYE \npayment thresholds to 5% and claimed no authority to do so. \n198.  In the 2015 Final Rule, the Department created the Revised Pay As You Earn \n“REPAYE” plan, which was “modeled on the existing Pay As You Earn repayment plan,” but \nextended eligibility to “borrowers regardless of when the borrower took out the loans.”  80 Fed. \nReg. 67204.  The 2015 Final Rule adopted the same 10% payment threshold for REPAYE that \nwas used in PAYE.  Id. at 67205.  While the commenter suggested that the REPAYE plan use a \n \n   47 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 48 of 62 PageID #: 48\n \n5% payment threshold, the Department dismissed the idea.  Id. at 67213.  Separately, certain \ncommenters “expressed support for streamlining the multiple IDR plans into one improved IDR \nplan that would cap monthly payments at 10 percent of income[ and] provide loan forgiveness \nafter 20 years of payments” and suggested the Department use REPAYE as a model.  Id. at 67209.  \nThe Department responded, without caveat, that “such a change would require congressional \naction.”  Id. at 67210.  The 2015 Final Rule did not reduce the IBR or REPAYE payment thresholds \nto 5% and disclaimed authority to do so. \n199.  There has been no congressional action since the 2012 and 2015 Final Rules.  The \nDefendants  have  not  gained  discretionary  authority  to  reduce  the  10%  payment  threshold \nprescribed by the HEA to 5%.  The Final Rule’s purported goal of “streamlin[ing] the number of \nIDR options available to borrowers” through the REPAYE/SAVE plan, with a 5% payment \nthreshold is directly contrary to the discretionary limits that the Department itself expressed in \n2015.  The Final Rule’s amendment of this threshold to 5% is contrary to the HEA. \n200.  Finally, the HEA did not authorize the Defendants “to establish a structure for a \nrepayment option for borrowers who fail to recertify their income information on REPAYE” under \nSection 455(d)(4).  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43827.  The Final Rule asserts that “Sec. 455(d)(4) of the \nHEA provides the Secretary with discretion to craft ‘an alternate repayment plan,’ under certain \ncircumstances.”  Id.  (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(4)).  But the Final Rule omits necessary and \nrelevant portions of that section. The full section reads: “[t]he Secretary may provide, on a case \nby case basis, an alternative repayment plan to a borrower of a loan made under this part who \ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the terms and conditions of the repayment \nplans available under paragraph (1) are not adequate to accommodate the borrower’s exceptional \ncircumstances.”  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(4) (emphasis added).   \n \n   48 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 49 of 62 PageID #: 49\n \n201.  The Final Rule’s reliance on the section is improper because the establishment of \n“a structure” for a group of borrowers is antithetical to the HEA’s requirement that this subsection \nbe applied “on a case by case basis.”  Moreover, the reliance is improper where the section dictates \nthat its application requires any borrower make a personalized showing that “the terms and \nconditions of the repayment plans available under paragraph (1) are not adequate to accommodate \nthe borrower’s exceptional circumstances.”  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(4).  Section 455(d)(4) of the \nHEA does not provide the Secretary with the discretion he now claims. \n202.  Additionally,  the  Final  Rule  provides  no  evidence  or  argument  that  section \n455(d)(4) is being used with respect to borrowers in “exceptional circumstances.”  To the contrary, \nthe Final Rule admits that “large numbers of borrowers currently fail to recertify” their information \nfor their loans.  88 Fed. Reg. 43882.  Failure to meet this minimum requirement, which apparently \nmany borrowers do, is by its own terms not an exceptional circumstance and thus cannot serve as \nthe basis for invocation of this section. \n203.  In all respects, Defendants’ interpretation of the relevant statutory law is inferior.  \nBut even if their interpretations made sense, they would create grave constitutional concerns that \nCongress has violated the nondelegation doctrine by giving the Secretary unbounded authority \nwithout an intelligible principle and that Congress has violated the Appropriations Clause by \ngiving the Secretary authority to appropriate hundreds of billions of dollars in perpetuity.  At the \nvery least, the canon of constitutional avoidance cautions strongly against adopting Defendants’ \nposition.  \n204.  The Final Rule is contrary to the HEA and its amendments.  It should be set aside. \nCOUNT III – Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n205.  Plaintiffs re-allege all paragraphs above as if fully set out herein. \n \n   49 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 50 of 62 PageID #: 50\n \n206.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n207.  “The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires  that  agency  action  be \nreasonable and reasonably explained.”  Fed. Commun. Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 \nU.S. 414, 423 (2021). \n208.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious for a number of independent reasons, \nincluding that Defendants failed to consider numerous important factors, including the full cost of \nthe rule and important reliance interests.  Despite being aware of the shortcomings, Defendants \ndeclined to address them in the Final Rule or provided wholly inadequate explanations, brushing \noff concerns.  Elsewhere, the Final Rule’s explanation is internally inconsistent.   \n209.  The Final Rule is unlawful even measured on its own.  It is even worse when \nmeasured against the cumulative effect it would have with the President’s other mass loan \ncancellation policies, one of which was struck down and one of which was announced just last \nweek.  \n210.  First, the Final Rule fails to capture, account for, or report the full cost of its \nimplementation.  The Proposed Rule estimated the provisions would cost $137.9 billion over ten \nyears.  That total was increased to $156 billion in the Final Rule.   \n211.  The  Final  Rule  cost  estimates,  however,  are  based  on  the  assumption  that \nDefendants would prevail in Biden v. Nebraska.  Even though a commenter highlighted this \nlimitation and offered a suggestion for avoiding a (likely) pitfall, the Department refused to \nproduce a secondary estimate that reflected that possibility. \n \n   50 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 51 of 62 PageID #: 51\n \n212.  That would have been bad enough, and arbitrary enough, had the Final Rule been \nreleased before the Supreme Court’s decision.  It is even worse that the Department adopted this \nassumption after the Supreme Court had already ruled against the Department.     \n213.  By relying on an assumption that had already been publicly and saliently proven \nfalse, the Department’s cost calculation was by definition unreasonable.  This is a violation of \nDefendants’  statutory  duty  to  “reasonably  explain”  the  Rule,  including  by  responding  to \n“significant points” raised by the comments.  See Carlson v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, \n343-344 (D.C. Cir. 2019). \n214.  When the Supreme Court rejected the Departments’ mass debt cancellation plan, \nthe Final Rule’s estimated costs calculation became entirely untethered to reality.  According to \nthe CBO, a rejection of the mass debt cancellation plan would increase the estimated cost by nearly \n$50 billion in the first year alone.  That does not even include the concomitant increases over the \nremaining nine years of the estimated period. \n215.  Separately, independent reviews have found the estimated cost identified in the \nFinal Rule discounts the true cost of by a factor of three to seven over ten years.   \n216.  Further, the Final Rule is does not have a ten year sunset provision.  Thus, future \nborrowers will also be able to have their loans forgiven under this plan.  The Department has \nacknowledged as much.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43823–33.  The total cost of forgiving those loans and \nany other loans forgiven after 2033 are not calculated, or accounted for, as part of the Final Rule.  \nThey are sure to be staggering as the number of borrowers increase. \n217.  Though the number of future borrowers (and the amount of loans they will have \nforgiven) is currently unknown and unknowable, it is certain that future forgiveness under the Final \nRule will drive up the total cost of its implementation.  And Defendants forced it through anyway. \n \n   51 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 52 of 62 PageID #: 52\n \n218.  Additionally, drastically reducing or eliminating the PSLF incentive will cause \nPlaintiff States to incur additional compensation expenses to recruit and retain employees.  The \nFinal Rule does not consider this. \n219.  Second, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it did not consider States’ \nfinancial interest on tax revenue from loan forgiveness. \n220.  Normally,  “forgiveness”  through  income-contingent  repayment  is  considered \ntaxable income under by the Internal Revenue service.  The exception is for borrowers in the PSLF \nprogram. \n221.  Many States, including Missouri, follow the federal definitions when defining \nincome tax for state purposes, which normally includes student loan discharge.  Therefore, income-\ncontingent repayment “forgiveness” is taxable income at the tate level for borrowers in many \nStates. \n222.  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, however, removed student loan discharge \nas an income for purposes of federal AGI through December 31, 2025.  See 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5). \n223.  Despite being aware of this law, see 88 Fed. Reg. 43836 (referencing “American \nRescue  Plan”),  the  Department  still  unilaterally  forgave  hundreds  of  thousands  of  loans \nretroactively as they roll out this program.  Many of those loans would have been forgiven after \nDecember 31, 2025.  This accelerated forgiveness timeline deprives States of tax revenue. \n224.  The Final Rule disregards this concern despite acknowledging comment raising \nconcerns about the effect of the rule on “State tax revenue from loans that have been forgiven.”  \nId. at 43877. \n225.  Third, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider the \nreliance interests of the Plaintiffs and their entities.  See, e.g., DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., \n \n   52 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 53 of 62 PageID #: 53\n \n140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (“When an agency changes course . . . it must ‘be cognizant that \nlongstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into \naccount.’” (cleaned up) (citation omitted)). \n226.  The Final Rule fails to consider the Plaintiff States’ interest in using PSLF to recruit \ntalent and remain competitive.  State and local government employers cannot pay as much as \nprivate sector employers because they are primarily funded by taxpayer dollars and operate on \nyearly, limited budgets. \n227.  One of the tools they rely on to recruit and retain talent is the PSLF program. \n228.  The Final Rule drastically reduces the power of that incentive by a) reducing the \nmonthly payments of most borrowers to $0, regardless of loan size, and b) drastically accelerating \nthe forgiveness timeline up to and including the same timeline that Congress reserved for public \nservice borrowers. \n229.  Commenters on the Proposed Rule  also  warned of this issue, but  Defendant \nDepartment brushed aside these concerns despite noting “the benefits discussed in this regulation \nwould also be available to those seeking PSL[F].”  88 Fed. Reg. 43,880.  This ignores Congress’s \nexplicit intent of creating a benefit specific to the PSLF program that would encourage young \nAmerican to choose employment in the public sector. \n230.  The Final Rule did  not consider the Plaintiff  States’ reliance interest in  this \nimportant program and therefore it is arbitrary and capricious. \n231.  Fourth, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it changes course from \nnearly 30 years of Department practice on loan forgiveness.  Never before have the terms of loan \nrepayment been unilaterally changed into loan forgiveness such that the typical undergraduate \nborrower repays less than what they took out: only $6,121 for every $10,000 borrowed.  These \n \n   53 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 54 of 62 PageID #: 54\n \nborrowers no longer have to repay the full principal of their debts, not to mention the accumulated \ninterest on those. This is a huge change of course. \n232.  The Department has not only changed course without explanation but is wrongly \ndenying changing course at all.  The Department states that it has taken actions similar to this in \nthe past through the PAYE and REPAYE programs, but was never challenged on it. \n233.  The absence of a challenge of course does not excuse the unlawful action.  \n234.  Regardless of the legality of past actions, their own data demonstrate this is not \ntrue.  Prior to this change, the average undergraduate borrower paid more than what they owed.  \nThis makes sense as they are loans that collect interest.  \n235.  This is the first time that the Department has tried to redefine the loan programs so \nthat the typical borrower pays back less than the principal borrowed, with the remainder of the tab \npicked up by the American public.  This is a huge change of course that the Department refuses to \nacknowledge. \n236.  In addition, the Department also changed course on the timing of loan forgiveness.  \nPreviously, all income-contingent loans would only be forgiven after 20-25 years.  Only public \nservice loan forgiveness had a 10-year repayment timeline. \n237.  The Final Rule now allows many borrowers outside the PSLF program to receive \nforgiveness after as few as 10 years.  This is a significant change of course from past practice. \n238.  The Department refuses to acknowledge this change of course and instead tries to \nstate that always had this authority. \n239.  The  Department  also  refuses  to  acknowledge  its  previous  interpretations.  \n“[U]nexplained inconsistency in agency policy is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an \narbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \n \n   54 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 55 of 62 PageID #: 55\n \nU.S. 211, 222 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Department previously disclaimed \nlegal authority to reduce the 10% payment threshold prescribed by the HEA to 5% but now claims \nthat authority.  See ¶¶ 198–199. \n240.  Fifth, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it contains numerous \ninternal contradictions.  As an example, the Final Rule repeatedly states that it is designed to avoid \ndelinquencies and defaults by offering a more lenient income-contingent repayment plan. \n241.  However, the Final Rule also states that the last change to the income-contingent \nrepayment plan that lowered payments for individuals resulted in an increase is delinquencies and \ndefaults. \n242.  Sixth, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider \nmeaningfully the inflationary effects of the Final Rule, both specifically in the secondary education \nmarket and more generally for the entire U.S. economy.  The enormous inflationary pressures are \nan “important aspect of the problem” that Defendants were obliged to evaluate.  Michigan v. EPA, \n576 U.S. 743, 750-52 (2015)) (cleaned up).  They failed to do so and thereby violated the APA. \n243.  Seventh, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it  insists that the \nprovisions do not offer a grant when they plainly do just that.  The Final Rules’ statement is belied \nby the Department’s own data demonstrating that most undergraduate borrowers would pay back \nsignificantly less than what they borrowed, regardless of whether the borrowers are suffering \nfinancial hardship, are at risk of default, or have undertaken a decade of valuable public service \nemployment.  \n244.  This only makes sense when viewed through the lens of the Defendants using these \njustifications as a pretext and post hoc justification for improper ends. \n \n   55 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 56 of 62 PageID #: 56\n \n245.  This Final Rule is not the product of a well-reasoned decision.  It is a pretext to \nevade a Supreme Court decision.  \n246.  The Final Rule was published ten days after the Supreme Court in  Biden v. \nNebraska struck down the Defendants’ last ill-considered attempt at unlawful loan forgiveness.  \nJust in February, Defendant Biden said, “The Supreme Court blocked it.  They blocked it.  But \nthat didn’t stop me,” and, Defendant Cardona stated that if the Final Rule was not challenged in \ncourt “that means I’m not pushing hard enough.”   \n247.  Eighth, the Department’s income-exemption threshold (an increase from 150% to \n225%) and the payment threshold (down to 5% from 10%) are arbitrary and capricious \n248.  The Department justifies the 225% threshold, for example, by arguing that persons \nat that income threshold are “statistically indistinguishable from those with incomes below 100 \npercent of the FPL [federal poverty line].”  88 Fed. Reg. 43839.  The Department arrived at this \nunlikely conclusion by relying on data where persons self reported experiencing financial hardship.  \nId. at 43840. \n249.  But the idea that certain individuals are “indistinguishable” financially from others \nmaking more than twice their income is self-refuting.  Americans of many different income levels \nexperience financial difficulties, but the financial difficulties of a person with twice the income of \nanother are qualitatively and quantitatively different.   \n250.  For all these reasons, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \nCOUNT IV – Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act \nAgency Action in Violation of Statutory Procedures (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D)) \n \n251.  Plaintiffs re-allege all the above paragraphs as if fully set out herein. \n252.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n \n   56 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 57 of 62 PageID #: 57\n \n253.  The APA requires agencies to publish notice of all “proposed rule making” in the \nFederal Register, id. § 553(b), and to “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the \nrule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments,” id. § 553(c).  The Final \nRule, therefore, only can be issued, if at all, pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking under the \nAPA.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \n254.  Here, when the Proposed Rule was issued, the comment period was limited to the \nminimum thirty days.  Defendants rejected requests to extend this period to 60 days, which would \nhave allowed additional participation in the rule-making process.  This limited time period violated \nthe APA. \n255.  The Final Rule is not an interpretive rule, general statement of policy, nor is it a \nrule of agency organization, procedure, or practice otherwise exempt from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  Instead, the Final Rule is a substantive rule for APA purposes.   See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(4)–(5).  Further, it is a final rule because it represents the culmination of the agency’s \nconsideration and affects rights and obligations.  See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 \n(1997). \n256.  “[A] thirty-day period is, in the Administrative Conference’s view, ‘an inadequate \ntime to allow people to respond to proposals that are complex or based on scientific or technical \ndata.’    The  Administrative  Conference  itself  thus  suggests  ‘a  sixty-day  period  as  a  more \nreasonable minimum time for comment.’”  Petry v. Block, 737 F.2d 1193, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  \n257.  Executive  Orders  12866  and  13563  both  state  that  comment  periods  should \ngenerally be at least 60 days.  See 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (Sept. 30, 1995) (“[E]ach agency should \nafford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment on any proposed regulation, which in most \n \n   57 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 58 of 62 PageID #: 58\n \ncases should include a comment period of not less than 60 days.” (emphasis added)); 76 Fed. Reg. \n3821-22 (Jan. 21, 2011) (“To the extent feasible and permitted by law, each agency shall afford \nthe public a meaningful opportunity to comment through the Internet on any proposed regulation, \nwith a comment period that should generally be at least 60 days.” (emphasis added)).  The proposed \nrule asks for the public’s help in “complying with the specific requirements of Executive Orders \n12866 and 13563 and their overall requirement of reducing regulatory burden that might result \nfrom these proposed regulations.”  88 Fed. Reg. 1895. \n258.  For these reasons, most other agencies routinely provide at least sixty days of \ncommenting for major rules. \n259.  Providing only thirty days for commenting on a major rule such as this one is an \noutlier—and one for which the Department offered no meaningful explanation. \n260.  Here the Final Rule is both complex and enormously impactful—tens or hundreds \nof billions of dollars turn on each of its major parameters \n261.  In these circumstances, Defendants violated the APA by only providing thirty days \nfor comment. \n262.  This error was prejudicial and denied the public (including Plaintiffs) an adequate \nopportunity to comment on the proposed rule. \nCOUNT V – Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n263.  Plaintiffs re-allege all paragraphs above as if fully set out herein. \n264.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law; . . . (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short \n \n   58 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 59 of 62 PageID #: 59\n \nof  statutory  right;  [or]  (D) without  observance  of  procedure  required  by  law.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C), & (D). \n265.  The HEA requires that regulations affecting programs under title IV of the HEA be \npublished in final form by November 1 prior to the start of the award year—July 1—to which they \nwill apply.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1089(c)(1).  The HEA provides the Secretary with discretion to \n“designate  any  regulatory  provision  that  affects  the  programs  under  this  subchapter  and  is \npublished in final form after November one as one that an entity subject to the provision may . . . \nchoose to implement prior to the effective date in [section 1089(c)(1)].”  Id. § 1089(c)(2)(A).   Even \nwith that discretion, however, the statute requires the Secretary to “publish any designation under \nthis subparagraph in the Federal Register.”  Id.   \n266.  The Final Rule was published on July 10, 2023, and under 20 U.S.C. § 1089(c)(1), \nit was required to have an effective date of July 1, 2024.  \n267.  Though Defendant Cardona designated certain provisions for early implementation \nin the Final Rule, no designation was made at that time for the implementation of 34 C.F.R. \n§ 685.209(k)(3) before July 1, 2024. \n268.  Defendant  Cardona  did  not  make  a  designation  until  January  16,  2024,  and \nannounced that loan cancellation would begin commencing just 5 days later.  Defendants never \nmade any comment to explain why they were shifting position.  \n269.  Defendants implemented 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(k)(3), in whole or in part, between \nJanuary 21 and February 21, 2024. \n270.  The implementation of 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(k)(3) occurred prior to its originally \nannounced effective date under the Final Rule. \n \n   59 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 60 of 62 PageID #: 60\n \n271.  Defendants implementation of 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(k)(3) resulted in the “approval \nof $1.2 billion in student debt cancellation for almost 153,000 borrowers.”  \n272.  This early implementation was arbitrary and capricious because it resulted in a \nsubstantial effect on the public treasury without any reasoned explanation for why Defendants \nwere accelerating loan cancellation by nearly 6 months.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF AND DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT \nPlaintiff States respectfully request this Court: \na.  issue an order and judgment declaring that the Final Rule violates the separation \nof powers established by the U.S. Constitution; \nb.  issue an order and judgment declaring that the Final Rule violates the APA \nbecause it is contrary to law, is in excess of statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, is an \nabuse of discretion, and is without observance of procedure required by law;  \nc.  issue an order and judgment declaring that the early implementation of 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1089(c)(2) violates the APA because it is contrary to law, is in excess of statutory authority, \nand is without observance of procedure required by law; \nd.  temporarily restrain and preliminarily and permanently enjoin implementation and \nenforcement of the Final Rule; \ne.  vacate and set aside the Final Rule; \nf.  award Plaintiff States reasonable fees, costs, expenses, and disbursements, \nincluding attorney’s fees, associated with this litigation; and \ng.  grant any additional and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate. \n \n   \n \n   60 \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 04/09/24   Page: 61 of 62 PageID #: 61\n \nDate: April 09, 2024  Respectfully Submitted, \n \nANDREW BAILEY  ASHLEY MOODY \nAttorney General of Missouri  Attorney General \n    \n/s/ Joshua M.

ECF No. 41.  Plaintiffs ask \nthe Court to issue an injunction or administrative stay by Sunday, June 30, 2024, to prevent \nDefendants from prospectively enforcing the entirety of the Final Rule.1  Given the compressed \ntimeframe, Defendants have not yet filed a response. \nThe Court has already thoroughly considered the issues raised by Plaintiffs when \nPlaintiffs presented their previous motions for preliminary injunction, a temporary restraining \norder, or a stay.  Indeed, after finding that Plaintiffs were only likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir claims as to the Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions, the Court issued a preliminary \ninjunction as to the loan forgiveness provisions of the Final Rule,.  ECF Nos. 35 and 36.  \nPlaintiffs have not provided an adequate basis for the Court to issue an injunction further \nenjoining any additional provisions of the Final Rule.  For the reasons already explained in the \n \n1    “Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan \nProgram and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program.”  88 Fed. Reg. 43,820. \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  45     Filed: 06/28/24     Page: 2 of 2 PageID #:\n1138\nCourt’s previous Order, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction or stay pending \nappeal.  See ECF No. 35.   \nAdditionally, the Court has already found that Plaintiffs’ delay in bringing this case \nundermines their request for immediate relief.  Plaintiffs now ask this Court to take immediate \naction to stay the Final Rule in its entirety on the eve of the rule’s full implementation and only \ndays after the Court issued its preliminary injunction in Plaintiffs’ favor.  The Court finds no \nreason to grant Plaintiffs relief that the Court has already determined is not appropriate on this \nrecord.  Again, for the reasons already expressed in the Court’s Order, the Court will deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion. \nAccordingly, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal or, in \nthe alternative, Temporary Administrative Stay of Agency Action (ECF No. 41) is DENIED. \nDated this 28th day of June, 2024. \n \n \n  ________________________________ \n  JOHN A.

Plaintiffs filed their Motion on June 29, 2024.  Defendants filed their \nresponse on July 8, 2024.  ECF No. 52.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on July 9, 2024.  ECF No. 53. \nThe Court has reviewed the parties’ arguments and has found that no additional \nclarification is necessary.  The Court’s preliminary injunction means what it says: that \n“Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from any further loan forgiveness for borrowers under \nthe Final Rule’s SAVE plan . . . .”  ECF No. 36.  The Court need not extend this injunction \nbeyond the scope of the Final Rule as Plaintiffs only sought injunctive relief from \nimplementation of the Final Rule, which the Court has granted in part. \nAccordingly, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Clarification of the Preliminary \nInjunction (ECF No. 48) is DENIED. \nDated this 10th day of July, 2024. \n \n  ________________________________ \n  JOHN A.

BIDEN, Jr., et al.,  ) \n      ) \n    Defendants.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n  The State of Missouri and six other states1 bring this suit against President Joseph R. \nBiden, Jr., Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona,2 and the United States Department of \nEducation challenging the Secretary’s rule, “Improving Income Driven Repayment for the \nWilliam D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) \nProgram,” (the “Final Rule”).  The Final Rule creates a new income-driven repayment (“IDR”) \nplan—referred to as the Savings on Valuable Education (“SAVE”) plan—to replace the Revised \nPay-As-You-Earn (“REPAYE”) plan.  Compared to the REPAYE plan, the SAVE plan: (1) \nincreases the amount of a borrower’s income that is exempt from payment calculations from \n150% to 225% of the federal poverty line (“FPL”); (2) decreases the maximum percentage of \ndiscretionary income that can be used to calculate monthly payments on undergraduate loans \nfrom 10% to 5%; (3) decreases the maximum time in repayment for borrowers with low initial \nprincipal balances to qualify for loan forgiveness from 20 years for undergraduate loans to as \n \n1   These are Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma. \n2   Plaintiffs’ claims against the Secretary and the President are brought against them in their \nrespective official capacities. \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 2 of 61 PageID #:\n1050\nlittle as 10 years3; and (4) provides that any accrued interest not covered by a borrower’s \ncalculated monthly payment is not charged to the borrower.  The Final Rule is to take full effect \non July 1, 2024, though the Secretary has designated some provisions for early implementation, \nincluding the early loan forgiveness provisions.  Thus, the Secretary has already forgiven \nhundreds of thousands of loan balances for borrowers in the SAVE plan.4  Plaintiffs argue that \nDefendants lack congressional authority to implement these changes or otherwise have violated \nthe law in promulgating the Final Rule.  Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and declaratory \nrelief to halt any further implementation of the Final Rule. \nThis matter is now before the Court on several motions.  On April 16, 2024, Plaintiffs \nfiled their Motion to Stay or, in the alternative, for a Temporary Restraining Order.  ECF No. 6.  \nOn the same day, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Stay or, in the alternative, for Preliminary \nInjunction.  ECF No. 7.  On May 7, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Response \nto Plaintiff’s Motions.  ECF Nos. 21 and 22.  On May 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their combined \nReply and Response to Defendants’ Motion.  ECF No. 26.  On May 27, 2024, Defendants filed \n \n3   Under the SAVE plan, borrowers with original principal balances of $12,000 or less \nbecome eligible for forgiveness of any remaining account balance after making at least 120 \nmonths (or 10 years) of eligible payments.  For each additional $1,000 in a borrower’s initial \nprincipal balance, the Final Rule permits full discharge of the unpaid balance after the borrower \nmakes an additional 12 months of eligible payments.  For example, a borrower with an original \nprincipal balance between $13,001 and $14,000 can have any remaining balance forgiven after \nmaking 144 months (or 12 years) of eligible payments.  The Final Rule sets a maximum \nrepayment period of 20 years for undergraduate loans or 25 years for graduate loans for \nborrowers choosing the SAVE plan and permits the Secretary to fully cancel any remaining \nbalances after borrowers have been in repayment for the maximum repayment period. \n4   Biden-Harris Administration Announces Additional $7.7 Billion in Approved Student \nDebt Relief for 160,000 Borrowers, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. (May 21, 2024), https://perma.cc/94CJ-\nZU8B (“Today’s announcement brings total relief approved under the SAVE Plan to $5.5 billion \nfor 414,000 borrowers.”). \n2 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 3 of 61 PageID #:\n1051\ntheir Reply.  ECF No. 29.  On June 3, 2024, the Court heard oral argument on the parties’ various \nmotions.  ECF No. 31.  All Motions are now ripe for disposition. \nThe Court has thoroughly reviewed the parties’ briefing and exhibits and has carefully \nconsidered the parties’ arguments.  Because the Court finds that at least one Plaintiff has standing \nand that venue is proper in this district, it will deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  The Court \nalso finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their argument that the early loan \nforgiveness provisions of the Final Rule were promulgated in a manner exceeding the Secretary’s \nstatutory authority.  And because Plaintiffs have shown that Missouri faces impending harm from \nany additional loan forgiveness under the Final Rule, the Court finds it necessary to enjoin \nDefendants from any further implementation of the Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions until \nthis matter can be fully litigated.  All other aspects of the Final Rule were promulgated properly.  \nFor these reasons and others set forth below, the Court will grant in part and deny in part \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Stay or, in the alternative, for Preliminary Injunction. \nBackground \nA.  The Higher Education Act and Accompanying Regulations \nIn 1965, Congress passed the Higher Education Act (“HEA”) “[t]o strengthen the \neducational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for \nstudents in postsecondary and higher education.”  Higher Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-\n329, 79 Stat. 1219 (1965).  The HEA authorized the Department to provide financial assistance \nto students seeking a post-secondary education in the form of “Educational Opportunity Grants” \nand by creating a federal loan insurance program administered by the Department to support \nstudent loans issued by qualifying private lenders. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 4 of 61 PageID #:\n1052\nIn 1993, Congress passed the Student Loan Reform Act, which created the Federal Direct \nStudent Loan Program,5 which for the first time allowed the federal government to issue loans \nfor post-secondary education.  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, \n107 Stat. 312 (1993).  As amended, the HEA provided borrowers with several options of \nrepayment plans, one of which was an income contingent repayment (“ICR”) plan “with varying \nannual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower, paid over an extended period of \ntime prescribed by the Secretary, not to exceed 25 years . . . .”  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D) \n(1993).  The 1993 amendments also provided that “[i]ncome contingent repayment schedules \nshall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary and shall require payments that \nvary in relation to the appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower (and the \nborrower’s spouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.”  Id. 1087e(e)(4).  The \nlanguage of section 1087e(e)(4) remains the same today as it was when first passed in 1993. \nIn 1994, the Secretary promulgated the first regulations regarding the standards, criteria, \nand procedures governing ICR plans, and these regulations became effective on July 1, 1995.  59 \nFed. Reg. 61664-01.  Under the authority provided by 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(e)(4), these regulations \ncapped the repayment amount for ICR plans at 20% of discretionary income6 (34 C.F.R. \n§ 685.209(a)(2) (1994)) and provided that “[i]f a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end \nof the 25-year repayment period under the [ICR] plan, the Secretary cancels the unpaid portion \nof the loan.”  Id. § 685.209(c)(2)(iv) (1994). \n \n5   Now known as the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1087a(b)(1). \n6   “Discretionary income” was defined as “a borrower’s [adjusted gross income] minus the \namount of the ‘HHS Poverty Guidelines for all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the \nDistrict of Columbia’ as published by the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices on an annual basis.”  34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a)(3) (1994). \n4 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 5 of 61 PageID #:\n1053\nIn 2007, Congress again amended the HEA.  College Cost Reduction and Access Act, \nPub. L. 110-84, 121 Stat. 784.  These amendments for the first time instructed the Secretary on \nhow the Department was to calculate the maximum repayment period under an ICR plan, but it \nprovided no specific definition of an “extended period of time” under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D).  Nor did it prevent the Secretary from forgiving loans at the end of the \nmaximum repayment period.  Instead, the amendments generally outline when payments under \nvarious repayment plans qualify towards the maximum repayment period, including months in \nwhich the borrowers are not in default or are in deferment due to an economic hardship.  The \nstatutory limits in section 1087e(e)(7) regarding the calculation of the maximum repayment \nperiod for an ICR plan remain the same today as they were when first passed in 2007. \nThe 2007 amendments also created a specific plan of loan forgiveness for public service \nemployees—the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (“PSLF”) program.  Under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1087e(m), the Secretary “shall cancel the balance of interest and principal due . . . on any \neligible Federal Direct Loan not in default for a borrower” who has made 120 qualifying \nmonthly payments and has been employed in a public service job throughout the entirety of those \n120 months.  The statute further specifies that “the Secretary shall cancel the obligation to repay \nthe balance of principal and interest due as of the time of such cancellation . . . .”  Id. \n§ 1087e(m)(2).  Outside of some amendments to the definition of a “public service job,” section \n1087e(m) remains the same today as it was when first passed in 2007. \nThe 2007 amendments created yet another repayment plan—the income-based repayment \n(“IBR”) plan.  College Cost Reduction and Access Act, Pub. L. 110-84, 121 Stat. 784 (codified at \n20 U.S.C. § 1098e).  The IBR program permits borrowers experiencing “partial financial \nhardship” to elect repayment under the IBR plan.  A “partial financial hardship” is when a \n5 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 6 of 61 PageID #:\n1054\nborrower’s annual loan payments as calculated under the standard repayment plan7 are greater \nthan 15% of the borrower’s (and the borrower’s spouse if filing jointly) adjusted gross income \n(“AGI”) less 150% of the FPL.  Id.  It also directed the Secretary to repay or cancel a qualified \nIBR plan borrower’s outstanding loan balance after a maximum repayment period of 25 years.  \nId. \nIn 2010, Congress amended the terms of the IBR program.  Congress lowered the \n“financial hardship” threshold to qualify for IBR from 15% of AGI less 150% of the FPL to 10% \nof AGI less 150% of the FPL.  And “with respect to any loan made to a new borrower on or after \nJuly 1, 2014[,]” Congress decreased the maximum repayment period under the IBR plan from 25 \nyears to 20 years.  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, \n124 Stat. 1029.  Section 1098e(e) remains the same today as it was when first passed in 2010.   \nCongress has made no significant amendments to the HEA since 2010, but the Secretary \nhas promulgated regulations controlling ICR plans.  In 2012, the Secretary implemented a new \nICR plan known as Pay As You Earn (“PAYE”) and incorporated some of the 2010 statutory \nchanges to the IBR plan into the Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan (“FFEL”) \nprogram.  77 Fed. Reg. 66,088-01.  Under the 2012 regulations, which became effective on July \n1, 2013, borrowers of loans disbursed after October 1, 2011,8 who could establish a partial \nfinancial hardship could elect to repay their loan through the PAYE program.  Id. at 66,137; 34 \n \n7   The standard repayment plan offers borrowers a “fixed annual repayment amount paid \nover a fixed period of time, not to exceed 10 years[.]”  20 U.S.C. § 1078(b)(9)(A)(i). \n8   An “eligible new borrower” under the PAYE plan was one who “[h]as no outstanding \nbalance on a Direct Loan Program loan or a FFEL Program loan as of October 1, 2007, or who \nhas no outstanding balance on such a loan on the date he or she received a new loan after \nOctober 1, 2007; and . . . [r]eceives a disbursement of a [qualifying loan] after October 1, \n2011 . . . .” making the PAYE plan available to borrowers who took out loans as far back as \n2007.  34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a)(iii). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 7 of 61 PageID #:\n1055\nC.F.R. § 685.209(a)(2) (2013).   A “partial financial hardship” under the PAYE program is when \na borrower’s annual amount due under the 10-year standard repayment plan is greater than 10% \nof the borrower’s AGI less 150% of the FPL, the same as it is under the IBR plan.  Id. at 66,137; \n34 C.F.R. §§ 685.209(a)(1)(v)(A) and (B).  Monthly payments under the PAYE plan “are limited \nto no more than 10 percent of the amount by which the borrower’s AGI exceeds 150 percent of \nthe [FPL] applicable to the borrower’s family size, divided by 12,” which is the same as the limit \nunder the IBR plan.  Id.; 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a)(2).  And, as with the IBR plan, qualifying \nborrowers who opted into the PAYE plan were eligible for loan forgiveness after making 20 \nyears of qualifying payments.  Id. at 66,139–40; 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a)(6).   \nIn 2015, the Secretary issued additional regulations creating a new ICR plan called the \nRevised Pay As You Earn (“REPAYE”) repayment plan.  80 Fed. Reg. 67,204.  These regulations \nbecame effective on July 1, 2016.  34 C.F.R. § 685.209(c) (2016).  Some terms of the REPAYE \nplan mirror those of the PAYE plan: borrowers’ monthly payments under the plan are again \nlimited to no more than 10% of the borrower’s AGI less 150% percent of the FPL and borrowers \nunder the plan qualify for loan forgiveness after 20 years of qualifying payment for \nundergraduate loans and 25 years of qualifying payments for graduate loans.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n67,239, 67,241; 34 C.F.R. §§ 685.209(c)(2)(i) and (c)(5) (2016).  Importantly, unlike the PAYE \nplan, which requires borrowers to show financial hardship and to have received loans after \nOctober 1, 2011, the REPAYE plan is available to all borrowers.9  80 Fed. Reg. at 67,239; 34 \nC.F.R. § 685.209(c)(ii) (2016).  The REPAYE plan thus has many of the same repayment \nprovisions as the PAYE and IBR plans but is available to more borrowers.  The terms of both the \n \n9   Except those borrowers who are in default and “parent borrowers” who obtained loans to \nhelp pay for their child’s education. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 8 of 61 PageID #:\n1056\nPAYE plan and the REPAYE plan remain in effect without significant alteration.  34 C.F.R. \n§§ 685.209(a) and (c). \nB.  The Final Rule \nOn May 26, 2021, the Secretary published in the Federal Register his intent to establish \nnegotiated rulemaking committees “to prepare proposed regulations for programs authorized \nunder title IV10 of the [HEA].”  86 Fed. Reg. 28,299-01.  It published the dates, times, and \nlocations of public hearings on the matter and permitted public comments on or before July 1, \n2021.  Among the issues the Department intended to address were “[l]oan repayment plans under \n34 C.F.R. . . . [§§] 685.208, and 685.209” and “[t]he Public Service Loan Forgiveness program \nunder 34 C.F.R. [§] 685.219.”  Id. at 28,300.  Virtual public hearings were held on June 21, 23, \nand 24, 2021.  Id.; see also 88 Fed. Reg. 1,894-01.  After these public hearings, the Secretary \npublished in the Federal Register notice of his intent to establish a committee to propose \nmodifications to the HEA loan repayment programs and requested “nominations for individual \nnegotiators who represent key stakeholder constituencies for the issues to be negotiated to serve \non the committee.”  See 86 Fed. Reg. 43,609.  Individual negotiators were nominated and \nselected, and the committee met several times to negotiate the subsequent rulemaking. \nAfter concluding the negotiated rulemaking process, on January 11, 2023, the Secretary \npublished a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”) outlining the proposed changes to the \nHEA loan repayment programs.  88 Fed. Reg. 1,894-01.  The NPRM explains that: \nThe  Secretary  proposes  to  amend  the  regulations  governing  [ICR]  plans  by \namending  the  [REPAYE]  repayment  plan,  and  to  restructure  and  rename  the \nrepayment plan regulations under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct \n \n10   Title IV refers to the “Student Assistance” section of the HEA, which includes all \nsections relating to the relevant student loans plans discussed herein.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070–\n1099d. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 9 of 61 PageID #:\n1057\nLoan) Program, including combining the [ICR] and [IBR] plans under the umbrella \nterm of “Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans.” \nId.  The NPRM further explained the Secretary’s intent to amend the regulations on IDR plans, \nspecifically to “expand the benefits of the REPAYE plan” by (1) increasing the amount of \nprotected income used to calculate borrowers’ monthly payments, (2) decreasing the share of \nunprotected income used to calculate borrowers’ monthly payments, (3) reducing the time for \nsome low initial balance borrowers to receive loan forgiveness, and (4) no longer charging \nborrowers accrued interest each month after borrowers make a qualifying payment.  Borrowers \nwould also receive credit toward loan forgiveness for certain periods of deferment or forbearance \nthat were not previously credited.  The NPRM set the date to receive public comments on the \nproposed rule for February 10, 2023—30 days after the NPRM’s publication.  Id. \n  After receiving public comments, on July 10, 2023, the Final Rule was published in the \nFederal Register.  88 Fed. Reg. 43,820.  In relevant part, the Final Rule’s outlines its major \nprovisions as follows: \nThe final regulations— \n  Expand  access  to  affordable  monthly  Direct  Loan  payments  through \nchanges to the [REPAYE] repayment plan, which may also be referred to as \nthe Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan;11 \n. . . \n  Increase  the  amount  of  income  exempted  from  the  calculation  of  the \nborrower’s payment amount from 150 percent of the [FPL] to 225 percent \nof FPL for borrowers on the REPAYE plan; \n  Lower the share of discretionary income used to calculate the borrower’s \nmonthly payment for outstanding loans under REPAYE to 5 percent of \ndiscretionary income for loans for the borrower’s undergraduate study and \n10 percent of discretionary income for other outstanding loans; and an \namount between 5 and 10 percent of discretionary income based upon the \n \n11   Throughout the Final Rule, REPAYE and SAVE are used interchangeably and both are \nmeant to refer to the changes to the REPAYE plan promulgated by the Final Rule. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 10 of 61 PageID #:\n1058\nweighted  average  of  the  original  principal  balances  for  those  with \noutstanding loans in both categories; \n  Provide a shorter maximum repayment period for borrowers with low \noriginal loan principal balances; \n. . . \n  Provide that the borrower will not be charged  any remaining accrued \ninterest each month after the borrower’s payment is applied under the \nREPAYE plan; \n  Credit certain periods of deferment or forbearance toward time needed to \nreceive loan forgiveness; [and] \n  Permit borrowers to receive credit toward forgiveness for payments made \nprior to consolidating their [FFEL] loans[.] \nId.   \nThe HEA provides procedural rules for when rules published by the Secretary may \nbecome effective.  Under 20 U.S.C. § 1089(c)(1), the Secretary must publish the final form of \nany rule by “November 1 prior to the start of the award year” for the Secretary’s rules to become \neffective during the next award year.12  The Final Rule was published on July 10, 2023, and the \nSecretary plans to fully implement the Final Rule by July 1, 2024.  88 Fed. Reg. at 43,821.   \nDespite the Final Rule’s July 1, 2024, onset date, the Secretary designated several \nportions of the Final Rule for early implementation under the procedural requirements provided \nby the HEA.  Under § 1089(c)(2), “[t]he Secretary may designate any regulatory provision that \naffects the programs under [Title IV of the HEA] and is published in final form after November 1 \nas one that an entity subject to the provision may, in the entity’s discretion, choose to implement \nprior to the effective date described in [§ 1089(c)(1)].”  This designation of provisions for early \n \n12   The “award year” is defined as “the period beginning July 1 and ending June 30 of the \nfollowing year[,]” which generally aligns the rule’s implementation date with the beginning of a \nschool year.  20 U.S.C. § 1088. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 11 of 61 PageID #:\n1059\nimplementation is accomplished by publication in the Federal Register and “shall be effective \nwith respect to that entity in accordance with the terms of the Secretary’s designation.”  Id. \n§ 1089(c)(2)(B).  Under this authority, the Secretary designated several provisions of the Final \nRule for early implementation on July 30, 2023: \n  Adjusting the treatment of spousal income in the REPAYE plan for married \nborrowers who file separately as described in § 685.209(e)(1)(i)(A) and (B); \n  Increasing the income exemption to 225 percent of the applicable poverty \nguideline in the REPAYE plan as described in § 685.209(f); \n  Not charging accrued interest to the borrower after the borrower’s payment \non REPAYE is applied as described in § 685.209(h); . . . \n  Designating in § 685.209(a)(1) that REPAYE may also be referred to as the \nSaving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan[; and] \n. . . the changes to the definition of family size for Direct Loan borrowers in \nIBR, ICR, PAYE, and REPAYE in § 685.209(a) to exclude the spouse when a \nborrower is married and files a separate tax return . . . . \n88 Fed. Reg. at 43,820–21.  The Final Rule also designated for early implementation the \nprovision for awarding credit toward loan forgiveness to certain periods of deferment and \nprovided that the Secretary “will publish a separate notice announcing the timing of the \nimplementation.”  Id. at 43,821.   \nOn October 23, 2023, the Department designated for early implementation a provision \nthat eliminated “the requirement for borrowers returning to SAVE after having previously been \non REPAYE to provide prior years’ income.”  88 Fed. Reg. 72,685-01.  This effectively \neliminated the obligations of borrowers under the SAVE plan to recertify their previous year’s \nincome to remain on the plan. \nOn January 16, 2024, the Department designated for early implementation the provision \nof the Final Rule permitting early forgiveness for certain borrowers with low initial principal \nbalances.  89 Fed. Reg. 2,489-01.  Since early implementation of the forgiveness provision, the \n11 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 12 of 61 PageID #:\n1060\nSecretary has forgiven hundreds of thousands of loan balances for borrowers opting for the \nSAVE plan. \nC.  Biden v. Nebraska \nThe Supreme Court’s recent ruling regarding the Secretary’s previous student loan \nforgiveness plan is instructive.  Though the Secretary in that case claimed the authority to forgive \nloans under a different statute not at issue here, there remains some overlap between the Supreme \nCourt’s analysis in that case and the issues presented here. \nIn 2001, following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Congress passed the Higher \nEducation Relief Opportunities to Students Act of 2001, which authorized the Secretary to \nmodify or waive provisions of the HEA student loan programs “in connection with the national \nemergency.”  Pub. L. 107-122, 115 Stat. 2386 (emphasis added).  This statute specifically \nauthorized full tuition refunds “to students who are members of the Armed Forced serving on \nactive duty during the national emergency.”  Id.  In both instances, “the national emergency” \nrefers to the September 11 terrorist attacks.   \nRather than let the Act terminate on September 20, 2003, Congress passed the Higher \nEducation Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (the “HEROES Act”), which again \ngranted the Secretary the authority to modify or waive “any statutory or regulatory provision \napplicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Act as the Secretary \ndeems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency \n. . . .”  Pub. L. 108-76, 117 Stat. 904. \nThe Secretary invoked this authority in the wake of the President’s declaration of a \nnational emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic13 to promulgate modifications and waivers to \n \n13   Presidential Proclamation No. 9994, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 13 of 61 PageID #:\n1061\nthe student loan repayment program.  One such set of modifications and waivers was published \nin the Federal Register on October 12, 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. 61,512-01.  There, the Secretary \nannounced his intention “to discharge up to a total of $20,000 in covered loans for affected \nindividuals who received Pell Grants and up to a total of $10,000 in covered loans for affected \nindividuals who did not receive a Pell Grant” for individual borrowers making less than \n$125,000 per year or married couples filing jointly making less than $250,000.  Id. \nSeveral states, including Plaintiffs Missouri and Arkansas, subsequently sought to enjoin \nthe implementation of the Secretary’s forgiveness plan.  Nebraska v. Biden, 636 F. Supp. 3d 991 \n(E.D. Mo. 2022).  On October 20, 2022, the district court dismissed the case for lack of standing.  \nId.  But on November 14, 2022, the Eighth Circuit granted the plaintiff States’ Emergency \nMotion for an injunction pending appeal to the Supreme Court.  Nebraska v. Biden, 52 F.4th \n1044, 1048 (8th Cir. 2022). \nOn June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court sided with the States and held the Secretary’s loan \nforgiveness plan under the HEROES Act was unlawful.  The Supreme Court in a six-to-three \nmajority opinion authored by the Chief Justice found that the plaintiff States had standing \nbecause the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (“MOHELA”) is an \ninstrumentality of the State of Missouri, and therefore Missouri suffered direct harm when \nMOHELA suffered harm from the loan forgiveness program.  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. \n2355, 2366–68 (2023)14 (“The Secretary’s plan harms MOHELA in the performance of its public \nfunction and so directly harms the State that created and controls MOHELA.  Missouri thus has \nsuffered an injury in fact sufficient to give it standing to challenge the Secretary’s plan.”).  The \n \n14   Unless otherwise noted, additional references to Biden v. Nebraska refer to the Supreme \nCourt’s Opinion at 143 S. Ct. 2355. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 14 of 61 PageID #:\n1062\nSupreme Court further held that the Secretary’s forgiveness plan was unlawful under the major \nquestions doctrine, holding that the HEROES Act language that granted the Secretary authority \nto “modify or waive” provisions of the student loan repayment plans was not “clear \ncongressional authorization” for the mass debt cancellation program.  Id. at 2375.  The decision \nnever directly spoke to the Secretary’s authority to implement repayment procedures under the \nHEA that are at issue in this case. \nD.  The Parties’ Motions \nPlaintiffs filed two motions, though their requested relief for each is essentially the same.  \nRecognizing that their requested forms of relief significantly overlap, Plaintiffs filed a combined \nMemorandum in Support of both Motions.  ECF No. 10.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to stay the \nFinal Rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  See 5 U.S.C. § 705.  In the \nalternative, Plaintiffs ask the Court to issue a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) or a \npreliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from fully implementing the Final Rule. \nAnticipating a challenge from Defendants regarding their standing to sue, Plaintiffs \npresent several arguments to support their standing.  Plaintiffs then argue that they will likely be \nsuccessful on the merits.  In particular, Plaintiffs contend that the Final Rule violates separation \nof powers principles requiring invocation of the major questions doctrine and otherwise runs \nafoul of the APA.  Plaintiffs argue that these violations necessitate vacatur of the Final Rule in its \nentirety.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that they face impending injury if the Final Rule is allowed to \ncontinue and that the public interest favors a stay or other injunctive relief to prevent its further \nimplementation. \nIn their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants ask the Court to dismiss this case for two reasons.  \nFirst, Defendants argue that the Court should not reach the merits of this case because Plaintiffs \n14 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 15 of 61 PageID #:\n1063\nhave not established standing, and therefore the case should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1).  Second, Defendants argue that even if Plaintiffs have standing, this Court is not the \nappropriate venue for this case and therefore it should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(3).  Defendants also argue that President Biden should be dismissed from the case. \nBecause the issues briefed by the parties overlap considerably, the Court will discuss the \nparties’ arguments by topic rather than in the order they were presented for the sake of clarity. \n1.  Standing \nPlaintiffs allege several theories of standing, though they emphasize that if the Court \nfinds standing for any one of them on any theory, the case should proceed as to all Plaintiffs.  \nDefendants vigorously oppose all of Plaintiffs’ standing theories and insist that each Plaintiff \nmust separately establish standing under each alleged theory before the Court can consider \ngranting Plaintiffs’ requested relief. \na.  Missouri’s Standing Via Harm to Its State Instrumentality \nPlaintiff Missouri asserts that it has standing based on alleged past and future harms to \nMOHELA from the implementation of the Final Rule.  Under this theory, Missouri is harmed \nbecause its public instrumentality, MOHELA, will lose revenue in two ways.  First, Missouri \nargues that when the Direct Loans serviced by MOHELA are forgiven under the SAVE plan, \nthose loan accounts will be closed and MOHELA will no longer collect administrative servicing \nfees for those accounts.  Second, Missouri argues that the Final Rule encourages borrowers to \nconsolidate FFEL loans into Direct Loans and therefore will (1) deprive MOHELA of interest \nrevenue from consolidated FFEL loans, (2) decrease the value of FFEL loans on the tradable \nmarket, and (3) harm MOHELA’s ability to issue bonds.  Plaintiffs emphasize that Missouri’s \ntheory regarding the loss of income from loan servicing fees when loans are forgiven, was \naccepted by the Supreme Court in Biden v. Nebraska and should have the same force here. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 16 of 61 PageID #:\n1064\nDefendants argue that the Supreme Court’s determination in Biden v. Nebraska that \nMissouri had standing in that case does not mean that Missouri has standing here.  Defendants \nspecifically attack the theory that Missouri has established that MOHELA is facing actual and \nimminent financial harm from ongoing loan forgiveness under the Final Rule.  Defendants point \nto MOHELA’s recent request that the Department reallocate 1.5 million of its Direct Loan \naccounts to other federal servicers.15  See ECF No. 22-3.  At the same time, Defendants admit \nthat, as of the date of its Motion to Dismiss, MOHELA had “discharged approximately 28,000 \nborrowers’ accounts under SAVE, and an estimated further 53,000 have been identified for \nforgiveness and are being processed.”  ECF No. 22 at 11; ECF No. 11-2 at ¶ 33.  Defendants \nargue that, because MOHELA has voluntarily requested that 1.5 million accounts be transferred \nto other servicers, Missouri cannot simultaneously claim harm from the closing of fewer \naccounts via loan forgiveness. \nDefendants also argue that MOHELA will actually benefit from the SAVE plan.  First, \nDefendants argue that with fewer loans to service because of loan forgiveness, MOHELA will be \nless likely to incur financial penalties, like a recent $7.2 million penalty imposed for servicing \nerrors.  Second, the Department has already distributed to MOHELA $1.6 million in transition \ncosts as part of the switch to SAVE.  Third, Defendants contend that the Final Rule will reduce \nborrower delinquency, decreasing servicing costs and permitting MOHELA to collect additional \nservicing fees on accounts that will otherwise fall into delinquency and default under previous \nloan repayment programs. \n \n15   The Department has indicated that it began transferring a portion of MOHELA’s accounts \nto other servicers at MOHELA’s specific request.  Update for MOHELA student loan borrowers, \nU.S. Dep’t of Educ. (April 29, 2024), https://perma.cc/NTZ6-BVK6. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 17 of 61 PageID #:\n1065\nDefendants are also highly critical of Plaintiffs’ theory that the Final Rule encourages \nborrowers of FFELs to seek consolidation.  Defendants argue that any harm under such a theory \nis contingent on the action of independent third parties and is far from certain.  Defendants also \nargue that, even if FFEL consolidation were to increase because of the Final Rule, Plaintiffs have \nnot established with sufficient certainty that such consolidation would actually harm MOHELA. \nPlaintiffs in their Reply ask that the Court to reject Defendants’ preferred balancing \napproach when assessing potential harms to MOHELA.  According to Plaintiffs, if MOHELA \ncan show that it will lose a single dollar because of the Final Rule, that is enough. \nb.  North Dakota’s Standing Via Harm to Its State Instrumentality \nPlaintiff North Dakota argues it has a separate basis for standing through alleged harms to \nthe Bank of North Dakota (the “Bank”).  The Bank provides loans to students enrolled in North \nDakota institutions of higher education.  According to Plaintiffs, the Final Rule will “unlawfully \nimpose[] a direct competitive harm” on the Bank because the loan terms offered by the SAVE \nplan are better than those offered by the Bank.  Under this theory, the Bank will lose potential \nrevenue because fewer borrowers will choose to take out loans from the Bank and will instead \nchose to take out Direct Loans to take advantage of the SAVE plan. \nDefendants contest the bases of this theory.  Defendants first note that North Dakota has \nnot clearly established that the Bank is an instrumentality of the state.  Defendants further assert \nthat this kind of competitor standing has never been extended to situations where the government \nitself was considered a competitor, but instead has been limited to cases in which government \naction increased the competitive advantage of one non-governmental actor over another non-\ngovernmental actor.  Defendants also argue that North Dakota’s standing argument improperly \nrelies on the actions of independent third parties that are not certain to occur. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 18 of 61 PageID #:\n1066\nc.  Plaintiffs’ Recruitment Theory \nPlaintiffs also contend that each of them has standing because the Final Rule harms their \nability to recruit and retain talent.  According to Plaintiffs, they rely on the PSLF program’s 10-\nyear loan forgiveness timeline to recruit and retain talent for state and local government \nemployment.  Plaintiffs allege that without the PSLF program’s comparatively strong benefits \nover traditional student loan repayment plans, recruits will be lured away from government work \nby the promise of higher pay in the private sector and a 10-year loan forgiveness timeline under \nthe SAVE plan.  Plaintiffs support these contentions with sworn affidavits from State employees \nwho attest to the importance of the PSLF program in the recruitment and retention of \ngovernment employees.  ECF Nos. 1-4, 1-5, and 1-6. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ theory improperly relies on the actions of independent \nthird parties and is speculative.  Defendants contend that the SAVE plan will continue to provide \nsignificant benefits to borrowers seeking PSLF forgiveness in the form of lower payments and \nlimited interest accrual and may even increase participation in the PSLF program.  Defendants \nassert that any injunction preventing the additional benefits provided by SAVE plan will actually \nexacerbate Plaintiffs’ concerns about recruitment. \nd.  Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Ohio’s Lost Tax \nRevenue Theory \nPlaintiffs Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Ohio separately argue that \nthey have standing because the Final Rule will decrease their tax revenues.  Generally, forgiven \nstudent loan balances (besides those forgiven via PSLF) are considered taxable income under the \nfederal definition of AGI.  26 U.S.C. § 108(f).  These Plaintiffs allege that, for the purposes of \nassessing state income tax, their tax codes tie their definition of AGI to the federal government’s \ndefinition.  See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. § 143.121 (“The Missouri [AGI] of a resident individual \n18 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 19 of 61 PageID #:\n1067\nshall be the taxpayer’s federal [AGI] subject to the modifications in this section.”).  Thus, in \nthese States, forgiven loan balances are generally considered taxable income.  But the American \nRescue Plan Act of 2021 at 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5)—passed by Congress in response to the \neconomic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic—specifically excludes discharged \nstudent loan debt from consideration of federal AGI through the end of 2025.   Therefore, these \nPlaintiffs argue that the SAVE plan, by permitting accelerated loan forgiveness, will decrease \ntheir expected tax revenues in 2026 and beyond when loans are forgiven on the SAVE plan \nbefore 2025. \nDefendants argue that such a theory of standing is self-inflicted and precluded by binding \nSupreme Court precedent.  Defendants assert that the alleged loss of potential tax revenue is of \nthe Plaintiff States’ own making and is unduly speculative.  Defendants contend that these \nPlaintiffs have the ultimate power over their tax codes and can, if they so desire, change those tax \ncodes to avoid losing tax revenue. \n2.  Venue \nDefendants argue that the case should also be dismissed for the independent reason that \nvenue is improper in the Eastern District of Missouri.  Defendants argue that under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C), Missouri is an “entity” who “maintains its principal place of business” in \nMissouri’s capital, Jefferson City, which is located in the Western District of Missouri.  Under \nthis theory, Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which alleges that venue is proper in this Court because \n“Plaintiff Missouri is a resident of this judicial district,”  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 35, is insufficient to \nestablish venue.  Defendants argue that, per the venue statute, the State of Missouri resides only \nin the Western District of Missouri. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 20 of 61 PageID #:\n1068\nDefendants also state that the allegation in Plaintiffs’ Complaint that “a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the Complaint occurred within this district,” id., is not \nsupported by any other factual allegations.  According to Defendants, the Complaint merely \ndescribes actions taken by the federal government in the District of Columbia and lists no \nspecific actions taken by any party in the Eastern District of Missouri.  For these reasons, \nDefendants request dismissal of this case for improper venue or, in the alternative, transfer to the \nWestern District of Missouri or the District of D.C. \nPlaintiffs disagree.  They point to caselaw indicating that courts have unanimously found \nthat venue is proper when a State brings a case in any district court within that State.  Plaintiffs \nalso contend that venue is proper in this Court because they are bringing this suit on behalf of \nMOHELA, whose principal place of business is in the Eastern District. \nDefendants assert in their Reply that the Ninth Circuit and other district courts were \nmistaken in finding that a State can bring a suit in any judicial district within that State.  \nDefendants ask the Court to reject the rationale used in the cases cited by Plaintiffs.  Defendants \nsimilarly discount Plaintiffs’ argument that Missouri’s residence has any connection to the \nlocation of MOHELA’s principal place of business. \n3.  Dismissal of President Biden \nDefendants briefly argue that Defendant Joseph R. Biden, Jr., should be dismissed \nbecause President Biden is not subject to Plaintiffs’ requested relief.  According to Defendants, \nthe Court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the president. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Court has the authority to issue declaratory relief and to issue \ninjunctive relief against the President when injunctive relief against the remaining Defendants \nwill not fully redress Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  They argue that the Court can, and should, enter \n20 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 21 of 61 PageID #:\n1069\ninjunctive relief against the President to prevent him from pursuing loan cancellation by \nexecutive order. \n4.  Statutory Authority and the Major Questions Doctrine \nPlaintiffs assert that the Final Rule was promulgated in excess of statutory authority, \nviolates separation of powers principles, and implicates the major questions doctrine.  Under the \nmajor questions doctrine, when an agency takes an action touching on issues of important \neconomic and political significance, the agency must find clear congressional authority \ndelegating such action to the agency.  Plaintiffs contend that the Final Rule is of such economic \nand political significance that it requires clear congressional authorization and that Defendants \nhave no clear statutory authority to promulgate a rule with the provisions found in the Final Rule.   \nPlaintiffs further allege that the HEA does not permit the Secretary to forgive any loans \nunder any ICR program.  Plaintiffs also argue that the general terms of the Final Rule unlawfully \nchange the ICR program from a loan repayment program into a grant program “for the typical \nborrower.”  Plaintiffs insist that the use of “repayment” in the statutory creation of the ICR \nprogram requires full repayment of any student loan. \nPlaintiffs also contend that the SAVE program under the Final Rule will make the IBR \nprogram irrelevant, indicating that the Final Rule is not statutorily authorized.  According to \nPlaintiffs, the Secretary cannot make an ICR program more generous than the IBR program \nbecause the IBR program was created by Congress.  Plaintiffs argue that any specific conditions \nset by Congress in the IBR program, like the percent of a borrower’s income considered when \ncalculating payments, cannot be more generous under an ICR program because Congress would \nhave set those conditions by statute as they did with the IBR plan.  Plaintiffs use this same theory \nto attack the provisions of the Final Rule providing for limits on the interest accrual as long as a \n21 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 22 of 61 PageID #:\n1070\nborrower participates in the SAVE plan because the IBR plan only permits the Secretary to \nsubsidize a borrower’s interest for a maximum of three years. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs argue that the Secretary’s interpretation of his power under the \nHEA is simply too broad.  Plaintiffs assert that repayment “over an extended period of time \nprescribed by the Secretary, not to exceed 25 years” does not mean, as Defendants suggest, that \nthere is no lower limit to the length of time a borrower must remain in repayment.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that “an extended period of time” must be at least 20 years as that is the minimum \nrepayment timeline to qualify for forgiveness under the IBR plan as set by Congress. \nDefendants argue that the Court need not rely on the major questions doctrine to decide \nthis case because the issues presented can be resolved using typical tools of statutory \ninterpretation.  And even though Defendants dispute the applicability of the major questions \ndoctrine, they still assert that Congress has provided clear authority for the Final Rule’s \nprovisions via the HEA. \nAdditionally, Defendants reject the applicability of the Biden v. Nebraska decision to this \ncase.  According to Defendants, the Biden v. Nebraska decision invoked the major questions \ndoctrine in relation to the Secretary’s reliance on the HEROES Act to create that loan forgiveness \nprogram but said nothing about the Secretary’s authority under the HEA.  Defendants emphasize \nthat this plan does not rely on emergency powers like those implicated by the HEROES Act, and \nthat any concerns the Supreme Court may have had about executive overreach in times of crisis \nare not applicable to the Final Rule. \nDefendants contend that Congress has granted them statutory authority to create ICR \nplans in 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  According to Defendants, the Final Rule is just another \nexample of the Secretary exercising that authority.  Defendants point out that, despite the \n22 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 23 of 61 PageID #:\n1071\nSecretary creating several ICR plans over the past three decades—including plans that allow for \nforgiveness for borrowers who make 20 years of qualifying payments—Congress has never \nspecifically prevented the Secretary from offering loan forgiveness under ICR plans. \nDefendants also question Plaintiffs’ position that the statutory provisions of the IBR plan \nare implicit limitations on the Secretary’s authority to promulgate ICR plans.  In Defendants’ \nview, if Congress wished to restrict the IBR plan’s provisions to borrowers experiencing a partial \nfinancial hardship, Congress would have explicitly limited the ICR plan in the way Plaintiffs \nsuggest.  And because Congress has not done so, the Court should not find the Secretary’s \nauthority contains this implicit limitation. \nPlaintiffs argue in their Reply that Defendants’ alleged admission that the Secretary has \nimplied authority to forgive loans under the ICR plan is sufficient to show that there is no clear \nstatutory authority for the Secretary to do so.  Plaintiffs further argue that, despite the Secretary \npreviously creating ICR plans that provided loan forgiveness, the Final Rule is of such economic \nand political significance that it invokes the major questions doctrine and requires the Secretary \nto established clear congressional authority for the Final Rule. \n5.  The Administrative Procedure Act and Arbitrary and Capricious Agency \nAction \nPlaintiffs contend that, regardless of whether the Final Rule implicates the major \nquestions doctrine, it is also unlawful because it is arbitrary and capricious agency action or \notherwise violates the APA. \na.  The Final Rule’s Cost Estimate \nPlaintiffs contend the Final Rule’s cost estimate is so inaccurate that its inclusion in the \nFinal Rule indicates that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  According to Plaintiffs, the \ncost estimate is flawed because it underestimates the cost of implementation and ignores that the \n23 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 24 of 61 PageID #:\n1072\nDepartment’s previous plan for loan forgiveness was struck down as unlawful by Biden v. \nNebraska.  Much of Plaintiffs’ argument on this point is based on the timing of the publication of \nthe Final Rule, which was 10 days after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Biden v. \nNebraska.  According to Plaintiffs, because the Secretary knew that the cost estimates as \npublished in the Final Rule were inaccurate at the time of publication, the Secretary’s \npromulgation of the Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious agency action. \nDefendants dispute that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious despite its seemingly \ninaccurate cost estimate.  Defendants argue the HEA does not require any cost-benefit analysis \nwith respect to ICR plans.  Defendants assert that the only reason the Secretary conducted a cost-\nbenefit analysis was to conform to Executive Order 12,86616 requiring an “Impact Analysis” by \nthe Office of Management and Budget to determine whether any regulatory action is \n“significant.”  88 Fed. Reg. 43,867.  Defendants contend that Executive Order 12,866 creates “no \nrights enforceable by litigation plaintiffs outside the executive branch,” and is therefore not \nappropriately enforceable by these Plaintiffs.  Defendants further emphasize that the Secretary \nhad finalized the Final Rule prior to the Biden v. Nebraska decision, so the fact that the Final \nRule was published after that decision does not undermine the Secretary’s analysis.  Defendants \nalso cite to the Secretary’s response to a comment in the Final Rule whereby the Secretary \nconsidered and ultimately declined the commenter’s invitation to conduct an alternative cost-\nbenefit analysis to account for the possibility that the Supreme Court would ultimately find the \nloan forgiveness plan under the HEROES Act unlawful. \nAdditionally, Defendants argue that, regardless of whether the Court agrees that the \nSecretary should have conducted an alternative cost-benefit analysis, such an error by the \n \n16   58 Fed. Reg. 51,735. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 25 of 61 PageID #:\n1073\nSecretary is not prejudicial.  Defendants take the position that reducing the burdens of student \ndebt via the Final Rule was a priority of the President and the Secretary and—despite the \nSupreme Court’s decision to strike down the previous loan forgiveness plan in Biden v. Nebraska \n—the costs associated with that plan were known to the Secretary and were acceptable because \nof its purported benefits.  Defendants argue that whether the costs of the HEROES Act loan \nforgiveness plan were incurred under that plan or will be incurred under the Final Rule, such \ncosts would not have discouraged the Secretary from promulgating the Final Rule given the \nadministration’s emphasis on providing borrowers with relief. \nb.  Defendants’ Alleged Failure to Consider Important Aspects \nof the Final Rule \nPlaintiffs assert that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious agency action because \nDefendants allegedly did not consider Plaintiffs’ reliance on state tax revenues and the PSLF \nprogram as part of the Final Rule.  Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants did not adequately \nconsider the inflationary effects of the Final Rule. \nDefendants dispute Plaintiffs’ contention that the Secretary did not adequately consider \nthe reliance interests of the States or the inflationary effects of the Final Rule.  Defendants point \nto the Secretary’s responses to comments in the Final Rule showing that he indeed did consider \nthe effect the Final Rule may have on state tax revenues, the PSLF program, and inflation.  \nDefendants contend that these responses definitively show that the Secretary did not act \narbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider these effects. \nc.  Alleged Procedural Violations \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule violates the APA because it was promulgated in \nviolation of statutory procedures.  Specifically, Plaintiffs take issue with the Secretary’s decision \nto limit the notice and comment period to 30 days.  Plaintiffs insist that a 30-day public comment \n25 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 26 of 61 PageID #:\n1074\nperiod was too short.  Plaintiffs assert that a 60-day comment period is the minimum time for \ncomment for a rule of this importance. \nDefendants argue that there is no specific requirement under the APA for a 60-day \ncomment period.  In fact, Defendants argue that the APA does not include any requirement \nbeyond giving interested parties the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.  \nDefendants cite to Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) for \nthe contention that a reviewing court has no ability to impose additional requirements on agency \nrulemaking not found in the APA.  In the alternative, Defendants argue that if the Court does find \nthat the Secretary erred by providing only 30 days for public comments, such error was harmless \nas the Secretary received over 13,600 written comments, some of which cover the issues \nPlaintiffs now raise in this case and were addressed in the Final Rule. \nd.  Plaintiffs’ Other Arguments \nPlaintiffs make several other arguments as to why the Final Rule is arbitrary and \ncapricious, including that Defendants have: (1) allegedly “departed from 30 years of regulatory \npractice”; (2) improperly stated the SAVE plan is a “loan” program when it is allegedly a grant \nprogram; (3) implausibly assumed that borrowers at 100% of the FPL are statistically \nindistinguishable from those at 225% of the FPL; and (4) provided for early implementation of \nportions of the Final Rule without proper explanation.  Plaintiffs assert that, for each of these \nreasons, they are likely to succeed on the merits.   \nDefendants dispute Plaintiffs’ contentions on each of these issues.  On each account, \nDefendants refer to the Secretary’s explanations in the Final Rule itself or challenge the \nadequacy of Plaintiffs’ explanations. \n   \n26 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 27 of 61 PageID #:\n1075\n6.  Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs argue that if they are not granted immediate relief, they will suffer irreparable \nharm.  They argue that MOHELA will suffer financial harm when (1) loans are forgiven under \nthe SAVE plan sooner than they would have been under previous ICR plans, or (2) borrowers \nconsolidate FFEL loans to take advantage of the SAVE program.  North Dakota argues that, \nwithout a TRO or preliminary injunction, the Bank—and thus North Dakota—will experience \ncompetitive injury by having to compete with the federal government for student loan business.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs assert that they will experience irreparable harm by the loss of competitive \nadvantage in the job market because of the alleged decreased appeal of the PSLF program and \nthe loss of tax revenue in those States that tie their State definition of AGI to the federal \ndefinition. \nDefendants’ arguments regarding Plaintiffs’ failure to establish irreparable harm mirror \nthose used to support their arguments against Plaintiffs’ standing.  But Defendants additionally \nargue that the timing of Plaintiffs’ Motions exhibits a lack of irreparable harm and weighs against \ngranting a TRO or preliminary injunction.  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ nine-month’s delay \nbetween the publication of the Final Rule and the filing of this lawsuit suggest that Plaintiffs \nwere not reasonably diligent in pursuing their case.  Defendants believe this delay undermines \nPlaintiffs’ claims of impending irreparable harm and alone is sufficient to deny Plaintiffs’ \nMotions. \nPlaintiffs deny that they delayed bringing this suit and that such delay undermines their \nassertion of impending irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs argue that unreasonable delay can undermine \nan argument for irreparable harm only when (1) the harms have already occurred, and (2) the \nparties cannot be returned to the status quo.  For Plaintiffs, neither is true in this case because a \n27 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 28 of 61 PageID #:\n1076\nvast majority of the harms they complain of will occur in the future and can therefore be rectified \nby the injunctive relief they seek.17  Plaintiffs also state that there was no unreasonable delay \nhere because the first time they were made aware of early implementation of the Final Rule was \nin February 2024, and they filed suit 48 days later.   \nPlaintiffs further argue that unnecessary delay cannot be a valid argument here because \nPlaintiffs, specifically the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, pursued non-litigation avenues \nbefore bringing this case.  Plaintiffs allege that in December 2023, the Missouri Attorney \nGeneral’s Office participated in the negotiated rule-making process for a different student loan \nrule.  According to Plaintiffs, that participation was Missouri’s attempt to pursue non-litigation \navenues to resolve this dispute. Plaintiffs admit that the Missouri Attorney General’s Office \nfailed to make any progress during the negotiations and eventually withdrew from the process. \n7.  The Public Interest \nPlaintiffs argue that the public interest heavily favors their position because they face \nirreparable harm while Defendants merely face a delay in implementation.  According to \nPlaintiffs, “[a]n injunction will re-establish the status quo as it existed before the publication of \nthe Final Rule and the Department’s early implementation of various provisions.”  ECF No. 10 at \n49.  However, Plaintiffs are asking only for a stay or injunctive relief to prevent any further loan \nforgiveness and full implementation of the Final Rule.  Plaintiffs also argue that borrowers \nreceiving loan forgiveness under the Final Rule will receive a huge windfall while the American \npublic will have to pay for it.  Plaintiffs then state that the public interest cannot lie in keeping \n \n17   Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they are seeking prospective relief and therefore \nare not requesting that the Court turn back the clock to reverse any loan forgiveness that has \nalready occurred. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 29 of 61 PageID #:\n1077\nthe allegedly unlawful Final Rule in place because the public has an interest in ensuring lawful \nagency rulemaking. \nDefendants argue that the public interest favors keeping the Final Rule in place.  \nDefendants assert that the public will experience several impending harms if the Final Rule were \nto be put on hold, including loan defaults, delinquency, adverse effects on borrowers’ credit \nscores, decreased borrower liquidity to make important purchases, decreased enrollment in \nhigher education, slowed national economic growth, and increased reliance on federal welfare \nprograms.  In Defendants’ view, these harms are certain to occur if the Final Rule is put on hold, \nwhile Plaintiffs have only presented speculative injuries.  Defendants also contend that the status \nquo is that portions of the Final Rule have already gone into effect and that injunctive relief at \nthis time would “result in chaos and uncertainty . . . .”  ECF No. 22 at 55. \n8.  Scope of Relief \nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs’ requested relief is overbroad.  Defendants suggest that, \nif the Court finds that the Final Rule is unlawful, it should grant limited relief only to those \nPlaintiffs that can establish standing and only as to provisions of the Final Rule that are found to \nbe harmful.  Defendants also suggest that the provisions of the Final Rule are severable such that \nthe Court in its discretion can grant injunctive relief only as to the specific provisions of the rule \nfound to be unlawful. \nPlaintiffs argue that their ultimate requested relief, i.e., vacatur of the entire rule, is \nrequired under the APA.  Plaintiffs argue that if the Court finds that Missouri has standing under \nBiden v. Nebraska, then all Plaintiffs have standing and that vacatur of the final rule is the only \nstatutorily appropriate remedy.  Plaintiffs further argue that, under the APA, if the Court finds \n29 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 30 of 61 PageID #:\n1078\nthat the Final Rule is unlawful agency action, then it must vacate the rule in its entirety or \npostpone the Final Rule’s effective date until the conclusion of this litigation. \nSimilarly, while Plaintiffs agree with Defendants that regulations can sometimes be \nsevered, Plaintiffs contend that severability is the exception and not the rule.  According to \nPlaintiffs, the limited severability exception is not applicable here because Defendants have \nfailed to show that the Secretary would have adopted the Final Rule if only the unchallenged \nportions remained.  Plaintiffs also contend that the remaining portions of the regulation would \nnot function sensibly without the provisions Plaintiffs seek to strike. \nLegal Standard \nA.  Motion to Dismiss \nWhen a party challenges the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction, at issue is the Court’s \n“very power to hear the case.”  Osborn v. United States, 918 F.2d 724, 730 (8th Cir. 1990) \n(citation omitted).  The Court has substantial discretion and is “free to weigh the evidence and \nsatisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.”  Little Otters of Love, LLC v. \nRosenberg, 724 F. App’x 498, 501 (8th Cir. 2018) (per curium) (citation omitted).   \nIn deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) regarding its jurisdiction to the hear the case, \nthe Court “must distinguish between a facial attack—where it looks only to the face of the \npleadings—and a factual attack—where it may consider matters outside the pleadings.”  Croyle \nex rel. Croyle v. United States, 908 F.3d 377, 380 (8th Cir. 2018) (citing Osborn, 918 F.2d at 729 \nn.6).  In either case, Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists.  \nBuckler v. United States, 919 F.3d 1038, 1044 (8th Cir. 2019). \nDefendants have not made clear whether they are lodging a facial or factual attack to \nPlaintiffs’ standing.  See ECF No. 21 and 22.  But in reviewing Defendants’ arguments, and \n30 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 31 of 61 PageID #:\n1079\ndespite the Defendants’ submission of additional exhibits for the Court’s consideration, the Court \ninterprets Defendants’ arguments as raising a facial challenge to Plaintiffs’ standing.  Thus, the \nCourt must accept as true all facts alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint as it would on any motion to \ndismiss raised under Rule 12(b)(6).  Carlsen v. GameStop, Inc., 833 F.3d 903, 908 (8th Cir. \n2016). \nDefendants moving to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3) generally must demonstrate that the \nplaintiff’s choice of venue is improper through affidavits or other evidence.  Gross & Janes Co. \nv. Jeff Neill Timberland Mgmt., Inc., No. 4:15-cv-1058-JAR, 2016 WL 4665954, at *2 (E.D. Mo. \nSept. 7, 2016) (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs allege that venue is proper in this Court under 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1).  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 35.  The general federal venue statute, in \nrelevant part, provides that: \n(b) . . . A civil action may be brought in— \n. . . \n(2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the \naction is situated; \n. . . \n(e)(1) . . . A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United \nStates or an agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal \nauthority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, except as \notherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (A) a \ndefendant in the action resides, (B) a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject \nof the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in \nthe action. \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1).   \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants are agencies or officers of the United States sued in their \nofficial capacities.  Plaintiffs further allege that Plaintiff Missouri is a resident of the Eastern \n31 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 32 of 61 PageID #:\n1080\nDistrict of Missouri and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the Complaint \noccurred within this district.  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 35.  In analyzing Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, \nthe Court must determine whether Plaintiff Missouri resides within this district or whether a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to this case occurred within this district.  If venue is \nimproper, the Court may either dismiss the action or transfer it to the proper district.  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1406(a). \nB.  Motions for Stay or, in the alternative, for TRO or Preliminary Injunction \nPlaintiffs seek a stay of the Final Rule, or, in the alternative, a TRO or a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Defendants from any further implementation of the Final Rule.  At this stage \nin the litigation, the Court will determine whether a stay or a preliminary injunction is \nappropriate. \nAs to the Court’s authority to issue a stay of the Final Rule, Section 705 of the APA \nprovides that when a plaintiff shows that a stay or preliminary injunction would be necessary to \nprevent irreparable injury, the Court “may issue all necessary and appropriate process to \npostpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion \nof the review proceedings.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The Court’s power under section 705 to issue a stay \non agency action is limited “to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury . . . .”  Id.; see \nalso Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 (5th Cir. 2016). \nThe Court has the discretion to issue a stay and considers four factors: “(1) whether the \nstay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether \nthe applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public \ninterest lies.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (citation omitted).  The mere possibility \n32 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 33 of 61 PageID #:\n1081\nof irreparable injury is not sufficient.  Id. at 434–35 (citation omitted).  When the government \nopposes the stay, the final two factors merge into an assessment of the public interest.  Id. at 435. \nBesides its authority to issue a stay under the APA, the Court may alternatively issue a \npreliminary injunction under traditional equitable principles.  This Court has broad discretion \nwhen ruling on preliminary injunctions.  Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 503 (8th Cir. 2006) \n(citation omitted).  “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, and the burden of \nestablishing the propriety of an injunction is on the movant.”  Ng. v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of \nMinn., 64 F.4th 992, 997 (8th Cir. 2023) (quoting Turtle Island Foods, SPC v. Thompson, 992 \nF.3d 694, 699 (8th Cir. 2021)).  Its “primary function . . . is to preserve the status quo until, upon \nfinal hearing, a court may grant full, effective relief.”  Ferry-Morse Seed Co. v. Food Corn, Inc., \n729 F.2d 589, 593 (8th Cir. 1984).  “[W]hether a preliminary injunction should issue involves \nconsideration of (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of balance between \nthis harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties litigant; (3) the \nprobability that movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.”  Dataphase Sys., \nInc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc); see also Winter v. NRDC, 555 \nU.S. 7, 24 (2008).  These factors are essentially identical to those the Court must analyze when \nconsidering issuing a stay.  No single factor is dispositive, but the Court should afford substantial \nweight to the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits.  Home Instead, Inc. v. Florance, 721 \nF.3d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 2013). \n“A movant shows a likelihood of success on the merits when it demonstrates a ‘fair \nchance,’ not necessarily ‘greater than fifty percent,’ that it will ultimately prevail under \napplicable law.”  Cigna Corp. v. Bricker, ___ F.4th ___, 2024 WL 2839930, at *3 (8th Cir. June \n5, 2024) (citing Heartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, 335 F.3d 684, 690 (8th Cir. 2003)). \n33 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 34 of 61 PageID #:\n1082\n“Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because \nits injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.”  Gen. Motors Corp. v. \nHarry Brown’s, LLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009).  Plaintiffs “must show more than the \nmere possibility that irreparable harm will occur.”  Ng, 64 F.4th at 997 (quoting Sessler v. City of \nDavenport, 990 F.3d 1150, 1156 (8th Cir. 2021)).  Rather, “[t]o demonstrate irreparable harm, \n[the movant] must show harm that is certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear \nand present need for equitable relief.”  H&R Block, Inc. v. Block, Inc., 58 F.4th 939, 951 (8th Cir. \n2023) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDiscussion \nA.  Standing \n“The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves \nto prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013) (citations omitted).  Article III of the \nConstitution limits the jurisdiction of federal court to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. CONST. \nart. III, § 2.  “For there to be a case or controversy under Article III, the plaintiff must have a \n‘personal stake’ in the case . . . .”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021).  To \nestablish this personal stake, plaintiffs must show: (1) they have suffered an “injury in fact” that \nis concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, (2) that there is a causal connection between \nthe alleged injury and the defendant’s conduct, and (3) that judicial relief will likely redress the \ninjury.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  “The party invoking \nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.”  Id. at 561.  Plaintiffs, \ntherefore, “must support each element in the same way as any other matter on which they bear \nthe burden of proof.”  Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Vaught, 8 F.4th 714, 718 (8th Cir. 2021) (citing \n34 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 35 of 61 PageID #:\n1083\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, on a motion to dismiss, \n“plaintiffs must allege sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference that they can satisfy the \nelements of standing.”  Id. (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007)). \nAn injury in fact is “‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and \nparticularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, \n578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  “A concrete injury must be de facto; \nthat is, it must actually exist” in reality rather than in the abstract.  Id. at 340 (cleaned up).  “For \nan injury to be particularized, it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.”  Id. at \n339 (cleaned up).   \n“Although imminence is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched \nbeyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III \npurposes—that the injury is certainly impending.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (emphasis in \noriginal and citations omitted).  “[A]llegations of possible future injury are not sufficient.”  Id. \n(emphasis in original). \n“For causation to exist, the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the \ncourt.”  Agred Found. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 3 F.4th 1069, 1073 (8th Cir. 2021) (citation \nomitted).  This “requires the plaintiff to show a sufficiently direct causal connection between the \nchallenged action and the identified harm.  That connection cannot be overly attenuated.”  Id. \n(citation omitted). \n“[W]hen the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he \nchallenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.”  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 36 of 61 PageID #:\n1084\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  “To satisfy that burden, \nthe plaintiff must show at the least that third parties will likely react in predictable \nways.”  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 675 (2021) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nRedressability requires the plaintiff to show that “it is likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 \n(cleaned up).  In assessing redressability, the court must “consider the relationship between the \njudicial relief requested and the injury suffered.”  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. at 671 (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). \n“If at least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may proceed.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. \nCt. 2355, 2365 (2023) (citing Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 \nU.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)). \nHere, Plaintiffs have established standing through the alleged injuries to MOHELA and \nthus to Missouri.  The allegations in the Complaint are substantially similar to, if not identical to, \nthose the Supreme Court held were sufficient to establish Missouri’s standing just last year in \nBiden v. Nebraska.  The Court finds no reason to reach a different result here. \nThe Final Rule calls for accelerated loan forgiveness for a set of borrowers with low \ninitial principal balances who elect repayment through the SAVE plan and make a set number of \nqualifying payments.  To the extent MOHELA services accounts subject to this early \nforgiveness—and there is no dispute that MOHELA does service such accounts—MOHELA will \nlose revenues from administrative servicing fee when those accounts are forgiven.  For \nforgiveness to occur, borrowers must first opt into the SAVE program and make the necessary \nnumber of qualifying payments.  There is some question of whether such a theory of harm relies \n36 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 37 of 61 PageID #:\n1085\ntoo heavily on the actions of third-party borrowers who may decide to not choose the SAVE \nprogram or who may otherwise not qualify for early forgiveness because they have failed to \nmake the necessary payments.  But in reality, thousands of loans once serviced by MOHELA \nhave already been forgiven by the Secretary under the early implementation of the Final Rule.  \nThousands more are primed for forgiveness in the coming weeks and months, making the alleged \nharm to MOHELA from early loan forgiveness certain to occur.  “This financial harm is an injury \nin fact directly traceable to the Secretary’s plan . . . .”  Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2366.  \nAnd “[t]he [Final Rule’s] harm to MOHELA is a harm to Missouri” because “MOHELA is a \n‘public instrumentality’ of the State.”  Id. (citing Mo. Rev. Stat. § 173.360).  Granting Plaintiffs’ \nrequested injunctive relief would redress this impending harm by stopping any additional \nforgiveness. \nTo the extent Defendants ask this Court to assess the alleged harms to Missouri by \nconducting a balancing test by weighing the Final Rule’s potential benefits to MOHELA against \nthe loss of administrative fees, the Court declines to do so.  Defendants have cited no case law \nfrom this Circuit indicating that any court has dismissed a case for lack of standing because a \nplaintiff could potentially benefit from the alleged injurious actions of a defendant even though \nthose alleged harms appear certain to occur. \nDefendants cite to Bueno v. Experian Information Sols., Inc., 664 F. Supp. 3d 800, 806 \n(N.D. Ill. 2023) for the contention that a plaintiff’s windfall is not an injury.  But the plaintiff in \nBueno alleged harm from a false—but ultimately beneficial—statement on her credit report.  The \ndistrict court found that because the false statement actually provided the plaintiff with a benefit, \nthe plaintiff failed to establish an injury sufficient to establish standing.  Defendants argue that \nthe same can be said for MOHELA here because MOHELA has requested that the Secretary \n37 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 38 of 61 PageID #:\n1086\nreallocate 1.5 million of its Direct Loan accounts to other loan servicers and MOHELA may \nreceive additional benefits under the Final Rule.  The Court does not agree, and again rejects the \ninvitation to conduct a balancing test.  Under Biden v. Nebraska, it is enough that MOHELA has \nshown that it has been and will be harmed by the Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions.  Any \npotential “benefits” MOHELA receives are incidental and do not affect the Court’s standing \nanalysis. \nDefendants next cite to Texas v. United States for the contention that some courts \nrecognize an exception where a court considers “offsetting benefits that are of the same type and \narise from the same transaction as the costs.”  809 F.3d 134, 155 (5th Cir. 2015).  But directly \nthereafter, the Fifth Circuit recognized that: \n[o]nce injury is shown, no attempt is made to ask whether the injury is outweighed \nby benefits the plaintiff has enjoyed from the relationship with the defendant.  \nStanding is recognized to complain that some particular aspect of the relationship \nis unlawful and has caused injury.  Our standing analysis is not an accounting \nexercise. \nId. at 155–56 (citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted).   \nMOHELA’s loss of administrative fees when loans it services are forgiven by the \nSecretary is not of the same type nor does it arise from the same transaction as the loss of \nadministrative fees when the Secretary reallocates Direct Loans held by MOHELA to other \nservicers.  Similarly, the other purported benefits of the Final Rule to MOHELA do not offset the \nalleged and actual harms experienced by MOHELA.  Taking Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, \nMissouri has adequately alleged that the Final Rule has and will harm Missouri via early \nforgiveness of loans serviced by MOHELA. \nBecause the Court finds that Plaintiff Missouri has standing, it need not address Plaintiffs’ \nother theories of standing.  This suit may proceed “[i]f at least one plaintiff has standing.”  Biden \nv. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. at 2365.  Even so, the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ other theories of \n38 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 39 of 61 PageID #:\n1087\nstanding are tenuous at best.  But because it finds that at least Missouri has standing, the Court \nwill deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack standing. \nB.  Venue \nIn what appears to be an issue of first impression in this Circuit, Defendants argue that \nthis case should be dismissed for improper venue, or, in the alternative, this case should be \ntransferred to the Western District of Missouri or the District of D.C.  Defendants argue that the \nrules of venue require Missouri to file cases as a plaintiff only in the Western District of Missouri \nbecause Missouri’s capital, and thus its principal place of business, is located in that district.  In \nsupport, Defendants cite instances where courts have dismissed cases for improper venue when \nplaintiffs sued State officials in the federal judicial district that does not include the State’s \ncapital.  The Court agrees that when a plaintiff seeks to sue Missouri officials for official actions, \nthe Western District is the proper venue for such a case generally.  But that is not the case here, \nwhere  Missouri, and not a Missouri state official, is a plaintiff.  Defendants cite to no cases \nwhere a court found venue improper when a plaintiff State sued in a district within that State \nwhere the State’s capital does not sit. \nOn the contrary, Defendants’ argument has been rejected by every court where it has been \nraised.  See Utah v. Walsh, No. 2:23-cv-016, 2023 WL 2663256, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 2023) \n(“[Plaintiff] Texas resides everywhere in Texas.”); see also California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 570 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (“A state is ubiquitous throughout its sovereign borders.”).  In line with other \ncourts considering this argument, the Court finds that the State of Missouri resides everywhere in \nMissouri and thus resides in this district.  Cases where “a defendant is an officer or employee of \nthe United States or an agency thereof . . . or an agency of the United States . . . may . . . be \nbrought in any judicial district in which . . . the plaintiff resides . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  \n39 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 40 of 61 PageID #:\n1088\nThe State of Missouri resides in the Eastern District of Missouri, and therefore venue is proper in \nthis Court.  The Court will therefore deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for improper venue. \nC.  President Biden \nDefendants argue that President Biden should be dismissed as a Defendant because the \nCourt lacks the authority to issue injunctive relief against the President.  Plaintiffs agree that the \nCourt lacks the authority “in general” to issue an injunction against the President.  But Plaintiffs \nalso argue that the Court has such authority in limited circumstances when an injury “cannot be \n‘redressed fully by injunctive relief against the remaining Defendants.’”  ECF No. 26 at 54 \n(quoting Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 788 (9th Cir. 2017), vacated on other grounds, 583 U.S. \n941 (2017)).  Plaintiffs specifically point to statements made by President Biden indicating his \nintent to, in Plaintiffs’ words, “evade the Supreme Court.”  Id.  Plaintiffs contend that without \nentering declarative relief against President Biden, he will simply attempt to enforce the same \nstudent loan forgiveness via executive action.  Therefore, Plaintiffs say declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against President Biden are both proper and necessary. \nAt this early stage in the litigation, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs will not \nprevail against President Biden.  In so deciding, the Court makes no determination of whether \nsuch relief will be appropriate once Plaintiffs’ claims have been fully litigated.  But, at this time, \nthe Court will deny Defendants’ request to dismiss President Biden as a Defendant. \nD.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nSatisfied that it has jurisdiction over this case, the Court will next discuss the likelihood \nthat Plaintiffs will be successful on the merits.  The Court will first discuss whether Plaintiffs are \nlikely to succeed on their argument that the HEA does not provide the Secretary with the \nauthority to promulgate the Final Rule, and what effect, if any, the major questions doctrine may \n40 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 41 of 61 PageID #:\n1089\nplay in this analysis.  The Court will then discuss whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \narguments that Defendants’ actions in promulgating the Final Rule were arbitrary and capricious \nagency action or otherwise violate the APA. \n1.  The Secretary’s Authority Under the HEA \nOn its face, the HEA provides the Secretary with significant authority to promulgate \nregulations related to ICR repayment plans.  Under the HEA, the Secretary has significant \ndiscretion to determine the amount of time that borrowers can participate in repayment under \nICR plans.  The only express limitation of that authority is that repayment under ICR plans \ncannot exceed 25 years.  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  Similarly, the Secretary has significant \nauthority to determine repayment schedules for ICR programs through promulgated regulations.  \nId. § 1087e(e)(4) (“Income contingent repayment schedules shall be established by regulations \npromulgated by the Secretary and shall require payments that vary in relation to the appropriate \nportion of the annual income of the borrower . . . as determined by the Secretary.”).  The \nSecretary also enjoys broad discretion regarding how and when interest can be capitalized on \nloans in repayment under ICR plans.  Id. § 1087(e)(5) (“The Secretary may promulgate \nregulations limiting the amount of interest that may be capitalized on such loan, and the timing \nof any such capitalization.”).   \nFaced with these statutory provisions, Plaintiffs argue that the Secretary’s authority to \npromulgate rules for ICR plans under the HEA is implicitly limited by the terms of the \ncongressionally created IBR plan.  Plaintiffs rely on this reasoning to question (1) the Secretary’s \nability to consider as exempt from payment calculations any AGI below 225% of the FPL under \nthe SAVE plan as opposed to 150% of the FPL in the IBR program; (2) the Secretary’s ability to \ncap payments under the SAVE plan at 5% of discretionary income rather than the 10% cap \n41 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 42 of 61 PageID #:\n1090\nprovided by the IBR program; (3) the Secretary’s ability to prevent borrowers from being \ncharged additional interest after making payments under the SAVE program as opposed to the 3 \nyear limit on interest subsidization in the IBR program;18 and (4) the Secretary’s ability to \nforgive loans under the SAVE program in as little as 10 years instead of the 20 year forgiveness \ntimeline provided for under the IBR program.  On that final point, it is Plaintiffs’ contention that \nthe Secretary has absolutely no authority to forgive loans under the ICR plan, let alone the \nauthority to forgive loans in as little as 10 years. \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the Secretary’s authority to set \npayment schedules and interest accrual limitations are unlikely to succeed on the merits.  A \nreading of the plain language of the statute supports the Secretary’s promulgation of the Final \nRule as to the modified ICR repayment schedules and interest accrual under the SAVE program.  \nStudent loan repayment programs are well within the wheelhouse of the Secretary and the \nDepartment.  Congress, in passing the HEA and its many amendments, has consistently tasked \nthe Secretary and the Department with promulgating regulations regarding ICR plans that are \n“necessary to implement effectively income contingent repayment.”  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(e)(1).  \nUnder this authority, the Secretary has significant discretion to promulgate rules to effectively \nimplement ICR plans, including the ability to (1) determine what constitutes discretionary \nincome, (2) set the cap on the amount of discretionary income that can qualify for payment \ncalculations, and (3) limit interest accrual and capitalization.  As more thoroughly outlined \n \n18   Plaintiffs contend that “[t]he ICR program expressly forbids subsidizing interest \npayments” and cites to 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b)(3) and § 1087e(b)(9) for support.  ECF No. 10 at \n35.  But § 1098e(b)(3) only controls the IBR plan and on its face does not appear to forbid \ninterest subsidization under the ICR plan.  Similarly, § 1087e(b)(9) deals with the Secretary’s \nauthority regarding reducing interest rates for loans disbursed before July 1, 2012.  But as \npointed out by Defendants, the Final Rule does not make any attempt to reduce interest rates, so \n§ 1087e(b)(9) is not relevant to the Secretary’s claimed authority here. \n42 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 43 of 61 PageID #:\n1091\nabove, the Secretary has promulgated such regulations for decades.  Though the SAVE plan is \nthe first time that payments under an ICR plan are likely lower than payments under the IBR \nplan for most borrowers, Congress does not appear to have either explicitly or implicitly limited \nthe Secretary’s ability to create such a comparatively generous plan.  The same is true for interest \naccrual and capitalization, which again fall within the express discretion of the Secretary. \nFurther, the Secretary’s discretionary changes to the ICR program here appear reasonably \ntailored to accomplish the Secretary’s stated goal.  The Secretary explains that the Final Rule was \npromulgated in an attempt to curb the tremendous rise in student loan balances and to ease the \nburdens borrowers face in paying off loans under existing repayment plans.  The Secretary also \nstates that the Final Rule’s goal is ensuring that fewer borrowers fall into delinquency and \ndefault.  Having the SAVE plan offer low-income borrowers a repayment plan that permits low \npayment amounts—as low $0 per month—and limits additional interest accrual and \ncapitalization appear as two reasonable ways of accomplishing these goals.  To find that the \nterms of the IBR plan somehow limit the Secretary’s broad discretion to shape rules that \nreasonably address these matters is not supported by the history and plain language of the HEA.  \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenges \nto these specific provisions of the Final Rule. \nThe Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions present a more difficult issue.  According to \nDefendants, Congress intended to grant the Secretary authority under the HEA to forgive \nbalances on loans in the ICR program by creating a maximum repayment period of 25 years or \n“an extended period of time prescribed by the Secretary.”  20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D).  The \nSecretary’s claimed authority here is not new.  Under this alleged authority, the Secretary has \n43 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 44 of 61 PageID #:\n1092\nbeen providing loan cancellation for loans in the ICR plan since the first ICR regulations became \neffective in 1995. \nDespite this history, the plain text of the statute does not support Defendants’ position.  \nThe Court is not free to replace the language of the statute with unenacted legislative intent.  \nThigulla v. Jaddou, 94 F.4th 770, 777 (8th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted); see also Iverson v. \nUnited States, 973 F.3d 843, 849 (8th Cir. 2020) (“The case must be a strong one indeed, which \nwould justify a court in departing from the plain meaning of words in search of an intention \nwhich the words themselves did not suggest.”) (quoting Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, \n362–63 (1964)) (cleaned up); Argus Leader Media v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 740 F.3d 1172, 1176 \n(8th Cir. 2014) (“Congress expresses its purpose by words.  It is for [courts] to ascertain—neither \nto add nor to subtract, neither to delete nor to distort.”) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  It is true that offering forgiveness of loan balances after 25, or even 10, years of \nrepayments to borrowers under the SAVE plan will ensure that fewer borrowers will default or \nbecome delinquent.  These loan forgiveness provisions thus comport with the Secretary’s \nexpressed purpose for creating the Final Rule.  But because the statute is silent on loan \nforgiveness under the ICR program, it is at least equally as likely that the HEA’s time limitations \nin the ICR program refer to the maximum period that borrowers can be in repayment before the \nentire loan amount must be repaid or borrowers must default. \nPlaintiffs’ alternative reading—that § 1087e(d)(1)(D)’s language does not permit loan \nforgiveness under the ICR program—finds support in other portions of the HEA that explicitly \npermit loan forgiveness.  Congress has made it clear under what circumstances loan forgiveness \nis permitted, and the ICR plan is not one of those circumstances.  See Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. \nCt. at 2363 (“[The HEA] authorizes the Secretary to cancel or reduce loans, but only in certain \n44 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 45 of 61 PageID #:\n1093\nlimited circumstances and to a particular extent.”).19  Defendants counter that Congress required \nforgiveness under programs like IBR and PSLF but left forgiveness under ICR up to the \ndiscretion of the Secretary.  But considering the loan repayment scheme under the HEA in its \nentirety, the Court finds Defendants’ interpretation is questionable.  Plaintiffs, therefore, have a \n“fair chance” of success on the merits on their claim that the Secretary has overstepped its \nauthority by promulgating a loan forgiveness provision as part of the SAVE program.  Cigna \nCorp v. Bricker, ___ F.4th ___, 2024 WL 2839930, at *3 (8th Cir. 2024 June 5, 2024). \n2.  The Major Questions Doctrine \nPlaintiffs assert that the Final Rule violates separation of powers principles.  As part of \nthis argument, Plaintiffs state that this case requires the Court to invoke the major questions \ndoctrine. \nThe major questions doctrine has been recently invoked by the Supreme Court in several \ndecisions relating to actions taken by various executive agencies.  In these cases, the Supreme \nCourt explains that when the agency action complained of involves a matter of “vast economic \nand political significance,” the agency must find clear congressional authority approving of such \naction.

Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) \n(finding no clear congressional authority for the CDC to issue a nationwide eviction \nmoratorium); see also Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 114 (2022) (per \n \n19   Earlier this year, the Fifth Circuit came to a similar conclusion.  “Congress, after all, \nunambiguously authorized the Department to ‘cancel’ or ‘discharge’ student debt obligations in \nlimited circumstances. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1078-11(a)(2)(B) (authorizing the Department to \n‘cancel a qualified loan amount’ for individuals employed full time ‘in an area of national need’) \n(emphasis added); id. § 1087e(m)(1) (stating that the Department ‘shall cancel the balance of \ninterest and principal due’ for borrowers employed in a public service job) (emphasis \nadded); id. § 1087j(b) (directing the Department to ‘cancel[] the obligation to repay a qualified \nloan amount’ for teachers) (emphasis added).”  Career Colls. & Schs. of Texas v.

To convince us otherwise, \nsomething more than a merely plausible textual basis for the agency action is necessary. The \nagency instead must point to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the power it claims.”) \n(quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014)); Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S.

Under the express terms of the HEA, the Secretary has clear congressional \nauthority to promulgate the vast majority of the provisions of the Final Rule.  The HEA is not \nambiguous regarding its grant of discretion to the Secretary as to setting ICR repayment \n46 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 47 of 61 PageID #:\n1095\nschedules and determining the extent of interest capitalization as to loans in an ICR repayment \nplan like SAVE.  But Defendants have failed to point to a clear congressional authorization for \nthe loan forgiveness provisions of the Final Rule, and the Court has found none.  While the \nSecretary does not appear to be expressly precluded from forgiving loans under his ICR \nauthority, it is far from clear that Congress has expressly granted the Secretary such authority.  \nThus, Plaintiffs have a “fair chance” of success on the merits on their claim that the Final Rule \nviolates separation of powers principles.  Cigna Corp, 2024 WL 2839930, at *3. \n3.  Alleged Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n “Under the APA, review of an agency decision is limited[, and the Court] gives ‘agency \ndecisions a high degree of deference.’”  Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation v.

Id. \n(citations omitted). \n  Plaintiffs allege that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious agency action under the \nAPA for several reasons, some of which are more developed and relevant than others.  The Court \nfinds that none of these arguments are likely to be successful on the merits and will discuss the \nmost salient of them below. \na.  The Final Rule’s Cost Estimate \n  First, Plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule’s cost estimate is arbitrary because it failed to \naccount for the potential that the Supreme Court would strike down its previous loan forgiveness \nprogram in Biden v. Nebraska.  The Final Rule estimates the costs of its implementation to be \n$156 billion over the first ten years.  88 Fed. Reg. 43,820.  This cost estimate does not consider \nthe potential effect of the Supreme Court finding that the previous loan forgiveness program \nunder the HEROES Act was unlawful even though the Final Rule was not published until after \nthe Supreme Court decided Biden v. Nebraska.  Id. at 43,875. \nPlaintiffs contend that the cost of the Final Rule is much higher.  Plaintiffs cite to the \nCongressional Budget Office’s estimate that the program would cost $230 billion over the first \nten years.20  Plaintiffs also cite an independent cost analysis conducted by the Penn Wharton \nBudget Model estimating the 10-year cost of the Final Rule at $475 billion.21  Finally, Plaintiffs \n \n20   Re: Costs of the Proposed Income-Driven Repayment Plan for Student Loans, \nCongressional Budget Office (March 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/CTJ5-XBSV. \n21   Biden’s New Income-Drive Repayment (“SAVE”) Plan: Budgetary Cost Estimate, \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Penn Wharton Budget Model (July 17, 2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/GSC2-WP3F. \n48 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 49 of 61 PageID #:\n1097\ncite to a promotional blog post from an independent student loan planning organization that \nestimates the ten year cost to be over $1 trillion.22   \nPlaintiffs claim that the Secretary’s decision to promulgate the Final Rule under such an \ninaccurate estimate means that the Secretary did not act reasonably.  In this view, the Secretary’s \ndecision to publish the Final Rule without conducting an additional analysis was arbitrary and \ncapricious and requires vacatur.  For support, Plaintiffs cite to two cases from outside this district \nin which an executive agency action was found to be arbitrary and capricious because it relied on \noutdated environmental data.  ECF No. 10 at 39 (citing Dow AgroSciences LLC v. Nat’l Marine \nFisheries Servs., 707 F.3d 462, 473 (4th Cir. 2013) (finding that reliance on outdated water \nmonitoring data that was not representative of current environmental conditions indicated \narbitrary and capricious decision-making because the agency “chose to continue relying on the \noutdated data without explaining why.”); and Sierra Club v. EPA, 671 F.3d 955, 966–68 (9th Cir. \n2012) (finding that the EPA’s use of outdated emissions data when promulgating a rule was \narbitrary and capricious because it “did not analyze this new data or explain why it chose not to \nanalyze the data . . . .”).  Neither case is particularly relevant to the question of whether the \nSecretary’s cost estimate, which Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that the Secretary is under \nno obligation to conduct, means that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \n  Defendants contend that, despite the inaccuracy of the cost estimate and failure to \nconduct an additional cost estimate after Biden v. Nebraska, there is no basis to find that the Final \nRule was arbitrary and capricious.  Defendants contend that that the Secretary’s cost estimate is \nunreviewable because it is under no obligation to conduct one, let alone an accurate one.

Nebraska \nand support this contention with an affidavit of an employee who attests to have knowledge of \nthe Final Rule being signed by the Secretary and submitted for publication on June 24, 2023.  \nECF No. 22 at 43; ECF No. 22-1 at ¶ 3.  Defendants also contend that the Secretary acted \nreasonably by not considering the effects of a negative decision in Biden v. Nebraska because, \nwhen the Final Rule was finalized, the Secretary believed the Supreme Court would uphold its \nauthority to promulgate the loan forgiveness plan under the HEROES Act.  Finally, Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that, if there was an error, that such an error was \nprejudicial.  Defendants state that because the Secretary knew of the estimated costs of the \nHEROES Act forgiveness plan and approved that plan, he would just as easily have approved the \nFinal Rule if those costs were associated with the Final Rule instead of the previous plan. \n  The Court finds that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of this argument.  \nDespite the allegedly inaccurate cost estimate, the Secretary’s reliance on that cost estimate in \npromulgating the Final Rule was not unreasonable.  Congress has never required the Secretary to \nconsider costs when promulgating rules for the ICR plans, and the Secretary cannot be said to \nhave entirely failed to consider the cost of the Final Rule.   \nThere is also no indication that the Secretary’s reasoning for creating the Final Rule is \nsomehow invalidated by Plaintiffs’ preferred cost estimates.  Defendants have explained that \ntheir priority in promulgating the Final Rule was to “reduc[e] the crushing burdens of student-\nloan debt.”  ECF No. 22 at 45.  Plaintiffs seemingly have shown that the cost of such actions are \nhigh but have not established that a high cost somehow would fail to reduce the burdens of \nstudent loan debt.  As Defendants have explained, whether costs were to occur under the Final \nRule or would be spread between the Final Rule and the HEROES Act forgiveness plan, the \n50 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 51 of 61 PageID #:\n1099\nSecretary found that the need to provide relief to borrowers outweighs the estimated costs.  And \nthough the Secretary knew there was a risk that the Supreme Court would find its HEROES Act \nforgiveness plan unlawful when the Final Rule was finalized, it was reasonable for the Secretary \nto rely on his belief that he had the authority to promulgate the stricken rule.  On this record, the \nCourt has not found a sufficient basis to conclude that the Secretary’s cost estimate in the Final \nRule makes the entire Final Rule arbitrary and capricious agency action. \n  Plaintiffs urge the Court to find that Defendants’ harmless error arguments evince an \n“unalterably closed mind,” indicating that the Secretary’s action was not “rationally considered.”  \nUnder this theory, because the Secretary would have promulgated the Final Rule despite its \nincreased cost, the Secretary’s actions were not reasonable.  Plaintiffs cite to a completely \ninapposite case from the D.C. Circuit in support of this standard.  ECF No. 26 at 40 (citing Air \nTrans. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 663 F.3d 476, 487 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  Plaintiffs \nhave cited no cases endorsing this “unalterably closed mind” approach.  In fact, the Supreme \nCourt appears to have recently rejected a substantially similar test.  Little Sisters of the Poor \nSaints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. 657, 685 (2020) (“We decline to evaluate \nthe final rules under the open-mindedness test.”).  The Court finds no authority or reasoned basis \nto use such a test here. \n  The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have failed to show that they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim that the Final Rule’s cost estimate constitutes arbitrary and \ncapricious agency action. \nb.  The Secretary’s Alleged Failure to Consider Certain Issues \nPlaintiffs assert that the Secretary failed to consider the Final Rule’s implications on State \ntax revenues, the State’s reliance on the PSLF program as a recruiting tool, and the Final Rule’s \n51 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 52 of 61 PageID #:\n1100\nalleged inflationary effects.  But the Final Rule in fact does consider and respond to comments \nthat dealt with these issues.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,877 (responding to comments about the Final \nRule’s effect on State tax revenues); Id. at 43,879–80 (responding to comments about the effect \nof the Final Rule on the appeal of the PSLF program); Id. at 43,879 (responding to comments \nabout the Final Rule’s potentially inflationary effects).  Therefore, the Final Rule is not arbitrary \nand capricious for failing to consider these issues, and the Court finds that such an argument has \nlittle chance of success on the merits. \nc.  The Secretary’s Findings Regarding Income-Exemption \nPlaintiffs argue that the Final Rule’s explanation for an increase in income-exemption \nunder the SAVE plan from 150% of the FPL to 225% is based on unlikely and implausible \nconclusions.  Plaintiffs take issue with the Final Rule’s statement that, in the Secretary’s analysis, \npeople with incomes at 100% of the FPL and those with incomes at 225% of the FPL are \n“statistically indistinguishable.”  The Final Rule states that: \n[t]he Department chose the 225 percent threshold based on an analysis of data from \nthe U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and program Participation (SIPP) for \nindividuals aged 18–65 who attended postsecondary institutions and who have \noutstanding student loan debt.  The Department looked for the point at which the \nshare of those who report material hardship—either being food insecure or behind \non their utility bills—is statistically different from those whose family incomes are \nat or below the FPL. \n88 Fed. Reg. 43,832.   \nPlaintiffs decry this conclusion as implausible.  According to Plaintiffs, a person or \nfamily with an income at 100% of the FPL cannot experience the same financial difficulties of a \nperson or family making 225% of the FPL.  But this is not the reasoning the Secretary used.  \nInstead, the Secretary conducted an analysis of SIPP data to determine at what income level \nAmericans who previously attended college begin to experience material economic hardships \nlike food instability and inability to pay utility bills.  According to this analysis, Americans at \n52 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 53 of 61 PageID #:\n1101\n225% of the FPL report these economic hardships to a similar degree as those at 100% of the \nFPL.  This is a reasonable explanation of the statistical analysis the Secretary relied on as its \nbasis to set the income expectation under the SAVE plan at 225% of the FPL.  \nPlaintiffs offer no reasonable basis to question the Secretary’s analysis.  Plaintiffs’ do not \npresent an alternative analysis of SIPP data that undermines the Secretary’s conclusions.  Nor do \nPlaintiffs offer a cogent critique of the Secretary’s statistical methodology.  Plaintiffs do not even \ncite a single point in the SIPP data that may call the Secretary’s use of this data into question.  \nHaving failed to contend with the Secretary’s analysis on its terms, Plaintiffs’ argument falls flat.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ point here is not well taken, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs are \nunlikely to succeed on the merits under this theory. \nd.  The Secretary’s Alleged Failure to Explain Early Implementation \nPlaintiffs argue that the Secretary has failed to adequately explain the reasons why certain \nportions of the Final Rule were designated for early implementation.  Plaintiffs primarily dispute \nthe Secretary’s publication in the Federal Register of his intention to implement the early \nforgiveness provision in January 2024 rather than waiting until July 1, 2024, for full \nimplementation.  Defendants dispute Plaintiffs’ position and point to an explanation published on \nthe Department’s website five days before the publication in the Federal Register.23  More \nimportantly, Plaintiffs have cited to no case, statute, or regulation that would require the \nSecretary to provide a more robust explanation.  In fact, under the HEA, publication in the \nFederal Register appears to be the only requirement for early implementation.  20 U.S.C. § \n \n23   Biden-Harris Administration to Shorten Path to Debt Cancellation for Some SAVE \nBorrowers, U.S. Dep’t of Educ. (Jan. 11, 2024), https://perma.cc/M5ND-VFEM. \n53 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 54 of 61 PageID #:\n1102\n1089(c)(2).  That is exactly what the Secretary did here.  This argument is not likely to succeed \non the merits. \n4.  Alleged Procedural Violations \nPlaintiffs allege that the Final Rule was promulgated in violation of the APA’s procedural \nrequirements because it did not provide for sufficient time for public comments.  Under this \ntheory, Plaintiffs argue that a 30-day comment period “was patently insufficient in light of the \ncomplexity and staggering significance of the Final Rule.”  ECF No. 10 at 50. \nThe Supreme Court has “repeatedly stated that the text of the APA provides the maximum \nprocedural requirements than an agency must follow in order to promulgate a rule” and has \n“repeatedly rejected courts’ attempts to impose judge-made procedures in addition to the APA’s \nmandates.”  Little Sisters of the Poor, 591 U.S. at 685 (cleaned up) (collecting cases).  Thus, this \nCourt is in no position to impose a greater procedural requirement on the Secretary than those \nincluded in the APA. \nUnder the APA, executive agencies are required to give general notice of proposed \nrulemaking (5 U.S.C. § 553(b)) and “[a]fter notice . . . , the agency shall give interested persons \nan opportunity to participate in rule making through submission of written data, views, or \narguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.”  Id. § 553(c).  Plaintiffs insist that \nthis “requires the opportunity to be meaningful,” but the Court finds no reason to read this \nrequirement into the statute.  Plaintiffs have simply not pointed to any provision of the APA \nrequiring a comment period be longer than 30 days.  And without an APA provision requiring \nsomething more, the Court has no authority to require the Secretary to follow Plaintiffs’ preferred \ntimeline.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ argument for a procedural violation of the \nAPA is not likely to succeed on the merits. \n54 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 55 of 61 PageID #:\n1103\nE.  Irreparable Harm \nThe Court’s analysis of irreparable harm largely overlaps with its analysis of injury in \nfact for Plaintiffs’ standing.  The Court finds that Plaintiff Missouri has adequately pled an injury \nin fact to grant it standing to sue.  The question now is whether Plaintiffs face irreparable harm \nwithout the imposition of their requested injunctive relief.  The Court believes that Plaintiffs \nhave shown impending irreparable harm to MOHELA via impending loan forgiveness under the \nFinal Rule.24 \n“[T]he United States, as sovereign, is generally immune from suits seeking money \ndamages.”  Dep’t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Housing Serv. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48 (2024) \n(citation omitted).  But 5 U.S.C. § 702 permits suits “seeking relief other than money damages” \nagainst federal agencies.   \nHere, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, not money damages.  As mentioned above, \nPlaintiffs clarified at oral argument that they specifically seek prospective relief to enjoin \nDefendants from putting the Final Rule into full effect on July 1, 2024, and to prevent \nDefendants from forgiving any additional loan balances under the early implementation of the \nFinal Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions.  By their own admissions, Defendants have already \nforgiven tens of thousands of loan balances under early implementation of these provisions.  \nThousands of additional loans are primed for forgiveness in the coming months.  Defendants do \n \n24   Missouri also alleges it is harmed when borrowers consolidate FFELs owned by \nMOHELA.  Missouri’s allegations related to consolidation focus on the incentives created by the \nloan forgiveness provisions of the Final Rule and not on any other provisions.  Because an \ninjunction preventing any further loan forgiveness will adequately address any alleged harm \nfrom loan consolidation, the Court need not separately address whether Missouri faces \nimpending harm from such consolidation. \n55 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 56 of 61 PageID #:\n1104\nnot dispute this.  Instead, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ unexplained delay in bringing suit \nundermines their claims of imminent harm. \nThe Eighth Circuit has found that “delay is only significant if the harm has occurred and \nthe parties cannot be returned to the status quo.”  Ng. v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of. Neb., 64 F.4th \n992, 998 (8th Cir. 2023) (alterations accepted and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nMcKinney ex rel. NLRB v. S. Bakeries, LLC, 786 F.3d 1119, 1125 (8th Cir. 2015)).  “[T]he \nreasonableness of delay is context dependent.”  Id. \nHere, the Final Rule was published on July 10, 2023, and Plaintiffs filed this case nearly \nnine months later on April 9, 2024.  Plaintiffs then waited another week before filing their \nMotions for Stay, TRO, or Preliminary Injunction.  Plaintiffs explain that their delay was \nreasonable because had they brought the case earlier, it would have been dismissed as unripe.  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, it was only when the government announced in February 2024 that it had \nforgiven loans under the early implementation of the Final Rule that they believed they had a \nbasis to sue.  The Court questions the bases of Plaintiffs’ arguments.  Because of Plaintiffs’ delay, \nsome alleged harms have already occurred, which also weighs against Plaintiffs’ position. \nEven so, because Plaintiffs have explained that they seek only prospective relief, their \ndelay does not undermine a finding that they are facing irreparable harm.  What Plaintiffs \nultimately seek is an injunction preventing the full implementation of the Final Rule on July 1, \n2024, and any additional loan forgiveness under the SAVE plan.  Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are \nentirely focused on the Final Rule’s early loan forgiveness provisions, and this is what they seek \nto stop.  The status quo is where we are now with borrowers already making payments under \nearly implementation of the SAVE plan and expecting impending loan forgiveness.  Though their \n56 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 57 of 61 PageID #:\n1105\ndelay in bringing this case diminishes Plaintiffs’ claims of imminent harm, Plaintiff Missouri has \nadequately alleged a threat of irreparable harm in the form of this early loan forgiveness. \nF.  The Public Interest \nPlaintiffs argue that the public interest favors a stay or preliminary injunction because the \ncosts of the Final Rule will fall on the shoulders of the American public and that it is \nfundamentally unfair to ask taxpayers to shoulder the burden of student loan debt owned by a \nrelatively small portion of the population.  Plaintiffs also argue that there is no public interest in \nallowing the Defendants to promulgate an allegedly unlawful rule. \nDefendants counter that the public at large faces several impending harms if Plaintiffs are \ngranted injunctive relief, including increased default and delinquency on student loans, adverse \neffects on credit scores, decreased liquidity, decreased enrollment in higher education, drags on \neconomic growth, and increased reliance on federal welfare programs.  According to Defendants, \nthese harms would result if implementation of the Final Rule is enjoined, though Defendants \npresented very limited evidence that such harms would occur. \nThe Court must, of course, also consider the practical impacts of enjoining the Final \nRule’s implementation because, again, there are millions of borrowers who have already \nswitched to the SAVE plan.  These borrowers have already made payments under the program, \nhave already had those payments calculated under the early implementation of certain provisions \nof the Final Rule, and some borrowers anticipate imminent forgiveness.  These borrowers and \nthe public have an interest in ensuring consistency in loan repayment programs, and any \npreliminary injunction would harm their expectations of such consistency. \nTaking these factors under consideration, the Court finds that there are serious public \ninterest concerns favoring both parties’ arguments.  While there are clear effects on taxpayers \n57 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 58 of 61 PageID #:\n1106\nwho have never received student loan benefits or have already repaid their loan balances in full, \nthe benefits to the economy from the SAVE plan and increased educational opportunities it offers \nmay outweigh these generalized public burdens.  Similarly, while the public has an interest in \nconsistency in student loan repayment programs and borrowers have a vested interest in knowing \nhow the provisions of those repayment programs will affect their repayment timelines and \nmonthly bills, the public at large has an interest in ensuring that those repayment programs are \nlawful.  Given these competing, albeit speculative, public interests, the Court finds that the \npublic interest factor does not particularly weigh in favor of either party. \nG.  Appropriate Relief \nPlaintiffs request a stay in implementation of the Final Rule, or in the alternative, a TRO \nor preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs argue that eventual vacatur of the entire Final Rule is \nstatutorily mandated under the APA.  But at this time, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ request to \nvacate the entire rule is not appropriate on the record before the Court.  Rather, at this stage, only \na stay or preliminary injunction is appropriate. \nThe question then is: what is the appropriate scope of a preliminary injunction, if any, at \nthis time?  Defendants argue that any relief should be limited to the redressing only the \ncognizable injuries of only those Plaintiffs who have established standing.  In Defendants’ view, \nif the Court has found that only Missouri has standing, then any relief should be directed towards \nthose harms that Missouri has been able to adequately connect to specific portions of the Final \nRule. \nIn the Court’s analysis, Plaintiffs have only alleged impending harm from the Final \nRule’s loan forgiveness provisions.  At this time, Plaintiffs have not stated a cognizable injury \nrelated to the other provisions of the SAVE program, and they conceded at oral argument that \n58 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 59 of 61 PageID #:\n1107\nthey are primarily seeking relief only from the Final Rule’s loan forgiveness provisions.  \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the APA are unconvincing, and in any event vacatur of the entire Final \nRule under the APA would be premature.  But Plaintiffs do appear to have a colorable argument \nthat the Secretary lacks the statutory authority to forgive loans as part of the ICR plans and that \ncontinuing to permit such loan forgiveness would likely harm Missouri by decreasing the \nadministrative fees collected by MOHELA for servicing Direct Loans. \nThis brings the Court to the issue of severability.  Defendants contend that, under the \nAPA, the Court may sever and enjoin only those provisions of the rule that are found to be \nunlawful.  The D.C. Circuit has recognized that portions of regulations found unlawful may be \nseverable under certain circumstances.  In making this determination, the D.C. Circuit has \nconsidered (1) whether the agency intended portions of the regulation to be severable, and (2) \n“whether the remainder of the regulation could function sensibly without the stricken provision.”  \nMD/DC/DE Broadcasters Ass’n v. FCC, 236 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing K Mart Corp. v. \nCartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988)); see also Carlson v. Postal Regul. Authority, 938 F.3d \n337, 351 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“[T]he APA permits a court to sever a rule by setting aside only the \noffending parts of the rule.”).   \nSeverability makes sense in the context of the APA, which defines an “agency action” as \n“the whole or a part of an agency rule . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  Under 5 U.S.C. § 701, “agency \naction” has the definition given to it under 5 U.S.C. § 551.  Therefore, when looking at what \nrelief is available pending review under 5 U.S.C. § 705, the Court “may issue all necessary and \nappropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action[,]” which suggests that the \nCourt has the authority to enjoin only the potentially offending portions of the Final Rule. \n59 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 60 of 61 PageID #:\n1108\nHere, the Secretary made clear his intention that each portion of the Final Rule is \nseverable.  “[E]ach of the components of this final rule can operate in a manner that is \nindependent and severable of each other.  The analysis used to justify their inclusion are all \ndifferent.  And while they help accomplish similar goals, they can contribute to those goals on \ntheir own.”  88 Fed. Reg. 43,828.  The fact that Defendants now argue for the severability of the \nprovisions of the Final Rule provide additional support for the proposition that the Department \nintended for portions of the Final Rule to be severable.  Thus, the first element of the severability \ntest is satisfied. \nThe Court also finds that, on this record, the Final Rule can function sensibly if the \nSecretary is enjoined from enforcing only the offending portions of the Final Rule.  Here, the \nCourt has found that the only argument for which Plaintiffs are likely to be successful on the \nmerits is that the Secretary lacks the requisite congressional authority to forgive loans under the \nSAVE plan.  Without the provisions allowing for loan forgiveness under the SAVE plan, the \nFinal Rule still provides a vast majority of borrowers with a plan that is likely to lower their \npayments and limit interest accrual.  At this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have not shown that \nthese provisions harm them, and these pieces of the Final Rule still appear to function \nadequately even if participants in the SAVE plan cannot receive forgiveness under the plan. \nThus, the Court finds that it is appropriate to limit a preliminary injunction to only those \nprovisions of the SAVE plan that permit loan forgiveness.  As litigation progresses, the Court \ncan determine whether that preliminary injunction should become permanent or if any other \nportions of the Final Rule require additional injunctive relief. \n   \n60 \n \n\nCase: 4:24-cv-00520-JAR     Doc. #:  35     Filed: 06/24/24     Page: 61 of 61 PageID #:\n1109\nConclusion \nAccordingly, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Stay or, in the alternative, a \nPreliminary Injunction (ECF No. 7) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Stay or, in the alternative, \nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order (ECF No. 6) is DENIED as moot. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from any \nfurther loan forgiveness for borrowers under the Final Rule’s SAVE plan until such time as this \nCourt can decide the case on the merits. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 21) is \nDENIED. \nDated this 24th day of June, 2024. \n \n  ________________________________ \n  JOHN A.
