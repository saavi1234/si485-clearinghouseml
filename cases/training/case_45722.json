    "summary": "<p>On April 19, 2024, the Biden administration announced its final rule interpreting Title IX, to go into effect on August 1, 2024. The Final Rule gave LGBTQ+ students and others explicit protection from sex discrimination &ldquo;based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&rdquo; In response, several states and school districts directed their schools not to comply with the federal interpretation of Title IX, and sued various members and departments in the Biden administration.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, on May 21, 2024, Carroll Independent School District, which is in Southlake, Texas, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Secretary of Education, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney General, and the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Represented by private counsel and the Alliance Defending Freedom, Carroll ISD sued under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that the Department of Education's Final Rule banning gender identity discrimination (89 Fed. Reg. 33,474) contravened Title IX's language, exceeded federal power, and was arbitrary and capricious. The District also challenged a related interpretive Fact Sheet issued by the Department as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to Title IX. Finally, the District argued that the Final Rule's definition of \"sex-based harassment\" violated the First Amendment by penalizing and chilling speech. The District sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On July 11, 2024, Judge Reed O'Connor granted in part and deferred in part the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found the District substantially likely to succeed on its claim that the Final Rule circumvented the statutory language of Title IX because Title IX's \"on the basis of sex\" language does not allow the government to bar discrimination based on gender identity. Further, the court held that the New Rule likely violated Title IX by discriminating in favor of transgender students. The court also held that the District would likely suffer irreparable harm in the form of compliance costs if the injunction was not granted. Therefore, the court enjoined the enforcement of the Final Rule against the District. However, the court deferred ruling on the District's request to stay the effective date of the Final Rule to prevent it from coming into effect. 2024 WL 3381901. Later that month, on July 31, the court denied the request for a stay of the effective date because the injunction provided adequate relief.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on August 16, 2024; the defendants cross-moved for summary judgment a few weeks later, on September 6.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2024, the defendants appealed the court's ruling on the injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (case Number 24-10824). On October 24, 2024, the Fifth Circuit stayed the appeal to wait for the outcome of a similar challenge to the Final Rule, <a href=\"../../../../case/45610/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Louisiana v. U.S. Department of Education</em></a>, which was also pending in the Fifth Circuit. As of November 24, 2024, the appeal remains stayed.</p>",

Plaintiff Carroll Independent School District (Carroll ISD) teaches its \nstudents  to  pursue  excellence,  exhibit  the  highest  standards  of  integrity  and \ncharacter, build relationships that foster mutual respect, communicate honestly, and \nmeaningfully serve others.  \n2.  In other words, it promotes the safety and flourishing of all its students.  \n3.  But, starting on August 1, 2024, the federal government will stand in \nthe way of Carroll ISD achieving those goals.  \n1 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 2 of 55   PageID 2\n \n4.  The Department of Education (ED) has redefined the word “sex” in \nTitle IX to include “gender identity.” \n5.  Congress  enacted  that  famous  1972  statute  to  promote  equal \nopportunities for women and girls.  \n6.  But  the  Department  of  Education’s  new  Title  IX  regulations  force \nCarroll  ISD—and  school  districts  across  the  country—to  do  the  opposite.  See \nNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving Fed. \nFin. Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 33,474 (Apr. 29, 2024) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.1 \net seq., effective Aug. 1, 2024). \n7.  This bureaucratic fiat  prevents Carroll ISD from protecting private \nspaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers for both girls and boys, opens girls’ \nsports to males, and infringes on the constitutional rights of students and staff.  \n8.  The administrative rewrite achieves the exact opposite of Title IX’s goal \nto  promote  equal  opportunity  for  women.  For  fifty  years,  “sex”  has  meant  the \nbiological binary—differences between male and female. Respecting these biological \ndifferences is essential to achieving that goal—and Title IX recognizes as much. But \nnow the Biden administration’s regulations will require schools to ignore sex to \npromote a person’s subjective “sense” of their gender.  \n9.  Schools must do so even though it deprives their female students of the \nequal opportunities in education that Title IX promised.  \n10.  Agency  action  cannot  stand  when  it  directly  contravenes  both  the \nstatute Congress enacted and fundamental constitutional guarantees.  \n11.  The Court should hold the Rule unlawful, set it aside as required under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706, and enjoin Defendants from \nenforcing it against Plaintiff Carroll Independent School District.  \n2 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 3 of 55   PageID 3\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.

Defendants are agencies of the United States and officers and employees \nof the United States or of any of its agencies acting in their official capacity or under \ncolor of legal authority. \n21.  Plaintiff  Carroll  Independent  School  District  resides  at  2400  North \nCarroll Avenue, Southlake, Texas 76092 in the Fort Worth Division of the Northern \nDistrict of Texas, and no real property interest is involved in the action. \n3 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 4 of 55   PageID 4\n \n22.  A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims \noccurred in this district because the case concerns the effect of Defendants’ regulation \non Carroll Independent School District and its operations in this division of this \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiff \n23.  Plaintiff Carroll Independent School District is located at 2400 North \nCarroll Avenue, Southlake, Texas 76092. \n24.  Carroll ISD’s board of trustees brings this suit in the District’s name. \nSee Tex. Educ. Code § 11.151(a). \n25.  Before taking office, all members of the board of trustees must take the \nofficial oath of office that he or she “will to the best of [his or her] ability preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State, \nso help me God.” Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 1; Tex. Educ. Code § 17.06-App. \n26.  The school district operates 11 schools for students from pre-K through \n12th grade.  \n27.  For the 2023–24 school year, the pre-K through 12th grade student body \nnumbered approximately 8,400. \n28.  Carroll ISD receives federal financial assistance as defined by Title IX. \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n29.  Carroll ISD receives federal funding administered by the United States \nDepartment of Education, including funding under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act and Titles II and III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  \n30.  For the 2023–24 school year, Carroll ISD received approximately $2.15 \nmillion from these and other federal funding sources. \n4 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 5 of 55   PageID 5\n \n31.  It would cause Carroll ISD significant financial harm to lose eligibility \nfor these federal programs. \n32.  Carroll ISD also receives funding from the State of Texas.  \n33.  Carroll ISD superintendent Lane Ledbetter and other District personnel \nhave already spent at least ten hours analyzing the Department of Education’s new \nTitle IX rule and obtaining legal advice on how the Rule applies to the school district. \n34.  Carroll  ISD  schools  offer  extracurricular  activities,  including \ninterscholastic athletics. Many school sports teams are sex-specific. For example, \nCarroll ISD fields separate boys’ and girls’ teams for basketball, cross country, soccer, \nswimming and diving, baseball/softball, tennis, water polo, wrestling, and track and \nfield. \n35.  Carroll ISD complies with Texas law, including the law to protect girls’ \nsports. See Tex. Educ. Code § 33.0834. \n36.  Carroll ISD is aware of at least 3 current students in grades 5–12 who \nhave identified as a gender identity that differs from their sex.  \n37.  Carroll ISD policies treat students consistently with their sex.  \n38.  Carroll  ISD  Policy  3.19  requires  its  schools  to  “maintain  separate \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and other similar facilities designated for and used only by \npersons based on the person’s biological sex.” Ex. A at 1.  \n39.  Policy 3.19 defines “restroom or locker room” as “a location where a \nperson may reasonably be in a state of undress, including a shower room.” Id. \n40.  Policy 3.19 also allows for “reasonable accommodations upon request,” \nsuch as a “single user restroom” to preserve “privacy.” Id.  \n41.  Carroll ISD Policy 6.9 prohibits District employees from “requir[ing] the \nuse of pronouns that are inconsistent with a student’s or other person’s biological \nsex.” Ex. B at 1.  \n5 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 6 of 55   PageID 6\n \n42.  Policy 6.9 provides that the district does “not compel” staff or students \n“to address or refer to students in any manner that would violate the speaker’s \nconstitutionally protected rights.” Id.  \n43.  Parents with children currently in Carroll ISD schools have informed \nboard members that they will withdraw their children from Carroll ISD if Title IX \nforces the school district to allow males into female restrooms, locker rooms, and \nshowers. These parents have concerns about the privacy and safety of their daughters \nif males are allowed into these private spaces. They also worry that their daughters \nwill not be able to use restrooms during the school day, which could lead to health \nproblems, because of the risk of encountering a male in those sensitive spaces.  \n44.  For  each  student  that  leaves  the  district,  Carroll  ISD  will  lose \napproximately $8,300.  \nDefendants \n45.

Order No. 12250; \n28 C.F.R. §§ 0.51, 42.412. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Title IX  \nA.  Congress enacted Title IX in 1972 to promote equal educational \nopportunities for women. \n60.  In 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, which forbids education programs \nor activities receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of \nsex. Title IX provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded \nfrom  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving \nFederal financial assistance[.] \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n61.  Title IX sought to eliminate discrimination against women in education \nand to provide men and women with equal educational opportunity. Its goal was to \ngive women “equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to \nsociety based on their individual talents and capacities.” United States v. Virginia, \n518 U.S. 515, 532 (1996). \n62.  Before Title IX was enacted in 1972, women were excluded from many \ncolleges and universities. Even where women were admitted, they were often subject \nto higher admissions requirements and excluded from many programs, like law \nschool and medical school.  \n8 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 9 of 55   PageID 9\n \n63.  As  summarized  by  DOJ,  Title  IX  has  been  strikingly  successful  in \naccomplishing its goals:  \nIn 2009, approximately 87 percent of women had at least a high school \neducation and approximately 28 percent had at least a college degree, \nup from 59 percent with a high school education and 8 percent with a \ncollege degree in 1970. Additionally, enrollment in higher education \nhas increased at a greater rate for females than for males; since 1968, \nthe percentage of women between the ages of 25 and 34 with at least a \ncollege degree has more than tripled. \nEqual Access to Education: Forty Years of Title IX, U.S. Dep’t Just. 2 (June 23, 2012), \nhttps://perma.cc/3GFD-74YX. \nB.  Title IX promotes equal opportunities for women in athletics. \n64.  Before Title IX, schools often emphasized boys’ athletic programs “to the \nexclusion of girls’ athletic programs.” Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, 998 F.2d \n168, 175 (3rd Cir. 1993). Many high schools did not have girls’ sports teams, which \nreduced  the  number  of  women  who  could  compete  in  college.  And  the  average \nuniversity devoted a mere two percent of its athletic budget to women’s sports.  \n65.  To end this discrimination against women in athletics, Title IX and its \nimplementing  regulations  have  long  defined  “program  or  activity”  to  include \ninterscholastic athletics. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a); 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,413–15, \n71,417–18 (Dec. 11, 1979). \n66.  Title IX and its longstanding implementing regulations allow an entity \nsubject to Title IX to provide athletic programs or opportunities separated by sex and \nrequire  those  programs  to  do  so  in  a  manner  that  “provide[s]  equal  athletic \nopportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c) (emphasis added). \n67.  Title IX recognizes that there are biological differences between the \nsexes, and these differences sometimes require sex-specific activities and facilities to \nprovide equal educational opportunity.  \n9 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 10 of 55   PageID 10\n \n68.  Title IX and ED’s longstanding regulations expressly permit schools to \nsponsor sex-specific sports teams “where selection for such teams is based upon \ncompetitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), and \nallow “separation of students by sex within physical education classes” for sports \nwhose major activity involves bodily contact, 34 C.F.R. § 106.34(a)(1).  \n69.  The same regulations require institutions to “effectively accommodate \nthe interests and abilities of members of both sexes” when offering sex-separated \nathletic programs. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c) (emphasis added).  \n70.  Title IX has been strikingly successful towards its intended goals of \nproviding women with opportunities for athletic competition and scholarships. It has \nincreased the opportunities for women and girls to benefit from being on athletic \nteams, develop skills associated with competitive sports, attend college on athletic \nscholarships, and participate in high-level competitions. \nC.  Title IX gives the federal government and private parties a \nmyriad of enforcement mechanisms. \n71.  Educational institutions receiving federal funding, like Carroll ISD, \nmust adopt policies that comply with Title IX and its implementing regulations. They \nmay not maintain policies that violate Title IX and its implementing regulations.  \n72.  Any member of the public may file a complaint about an educational \ninstitution that he or she believes is not complying with Title IX or the implementing \nregulations. \n73.  ED’s OCR can investigate complaints alleging that an institution has \nviolated Title IX and its implementing regulations. ED also has the authority to \ninitiate an investigation without receiving a complaint.  \n74.  If ED’s OCR finds a covered institution is noncompliant, ED may require \nthe institution to take remedial action at the risk of losing federal funding. 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1682; 34 C.F.R. § 106.3. \n10 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 11 of 55   PageID 11\n \n75.  The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to provide for a judicially \nimplied private right of action, Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 709, 717 (1979), \nincluding a damages remedy, Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 76 \n(1992), and awards of attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), see Cummings v. \nPremier Rehab Keller, PLLC, 596 U.S. 212, 218–19 (2022). \n76.  Defendants  claim  that  the  substantive  requirements  they  impose \nthrough their Title IX regulations are enforceable through Title IX’s private right of \naction.  \n77.  The Attorney General may bring an enforcement action against an \neducational institution that is not in compliance with Title IX and its implementing \nregulations.  \n78.  Any enforcement action puts an educational institution, like Carroll \nISD, at risk of losing federal financial assistance.  \nII.  Building off agency action in the Obama Administration, the Biden \nAdministration  imposes  gender-identity  mandates  on  federal \nantidiscrimination laws. \nA.  The Obama administration begins the rewrite of Title IX.   \n79.  In 2013 and 2015, Congress considered and rejected amending Title IX \nto prohibit “gender identity” discrimination. Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, \nH.R. 1652, 113th Cong. (2013); Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2015, S.439, 114th \nCong. (2015). \n80.  So the Obama administration turned from the People’s representatives \nto agency action.  \n81.  In  2014,  the  Department’s  OCR  published  a  “guidance”  document \nasserting  that  “Title  IX’s  sex  discrimination  prohibition  extends  to  claims  of \ndiscrimination based on gender identity” and “sexual orientation.” Questions and \nAnswers on Title IX and Sexual Violence B-2, OCR (Apr. 29, 2014). \n11 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 12 of 55   PageID 12\n \n82.  In May 2016, the Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter informing \neducational institutions about their new “Title IX obligations regarding transgender \nstudents.” 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX and Transgender Students 2, U.S. \nDep’ts of Educ. & Justice (May 13, 2016) (2016 letter), perma.cc/2VTQ-RUYP.  \n83.  The 2016 letter required that schools allow students to access locker \nrooms, restrooms, showers, and overnight accommodations based on a student’s self-\nasserted gender identity. Id. at 3–4.  \n84.  The 2016 letter required schools to “treat students consistent with their \ngender  identity,”  including  by  using  “pronouns  and  names  consistent  with  a \ntransgender student’s gender identity.” Id. at 3.  \n85.  This Court enjoined the implementation of the 2016 letter as contrary \nto law, holding “that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106.33 when it \nwas enacted by [ED] following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical \ndifferences between male and female students as determined at their birth.” Texas v. \nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 3d 810, 832–33 (N.D. Tex. 2016).  \n86.  In 2017, ED under the Trump administration withdrew the 2016 letter. \n2017 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX, U.S. Dep’ts of Educ. & Justice (Feb. 22, 2017). \n87.  In 2020, ED under the Trump administration promulgated regulations \nimplementing  Title  IX  that  recognized—consistent  with  how  Title  IX  has  been \napplied since its enactment—“sex” means biological sex. See Nondiscrimination on \nthe Basis of Sex in Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving Fed. Fin. Assistance, 85 \nFed. Reg. 30,026, 30,036 (May 19, 2020).  \nB.  President Biden directed federal executive agencies to add \ngender identity to federal laws. \n88.  Building  on the  Obama  Administration’s efforts to  rewrite  Title  IX \nwithout the People’s representatives, President Biden directed federal administrative \nagencies to implement gender-identity mandates throughout federal law. \n12 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 13 of 55   PageID 13\n \n89.  In Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020), the U.S. Supreme \nCourt held that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2, \nterminating an employee “simply for being homosexual or transgender” constitutes \ndiscrimination “because of … sex.” Id. at 681. \n90.  The Court assumed that “sex” in Title VII “refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.” Id. at 655. \n91.  The  Court  also  recognized  that  “transgender  status”  is  a  “distinct \nconcept[ ] from sex.” Id. at 669. \n92.  The Court emphasized that “other federal or state laws that prohibit sex \ndiscrimination,” such as Title IX, were not “before” the Court. Id. at 681. \n93.  The Court did not compare Title IX’s nondiscrimination provision with \nthe  distinct  text  of  Title  VII.  Compare  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-2(a)  (Title  VII),  with \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (Title IX). \n94.  Nor did the Bostock Court address Title IX’s provision allowing for sex-\nseparated living facilities or any of the other distinctions between the two sexes that \nTitle IX recognizes and permits. \n95.  Even so, on his first day in office President Biden declared that Bostock’s \nanalysis changed the meaning of all federal law on sex discrimination, claiming that \nany statutory reference to sex discrimination includes gender-identity discrimination \n“so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.” Exec. Order \nNo.  13,988,  Preventing  and  Combating  Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of  Gender \nIdentity or Sexual Orientation, 86 Fed. Reg. 7023 (Jan. 20, 2021). The President \nordered all executive-branch agencies to implement this view. Id. \n96.  A short time later, DOJ’s Civil Rights Division issued a memorandum \ninstructing all federal agencies that “Bostock applies to Title IX.” Memorandum from \nPamela S. Karlan, Principal Deputy Assistant Att’y Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Just. C.R. \nDiv., to Fed. Agency C.R. Dirs. and Gen. Couns. (Mar. 26, 2021). \n13 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 14 of 55   PageID 14\n \n97.  To Carroll ISD’s knowledge, the Biden administration has yet to say \nthat a single federal law banning sex discrimination does not also ban “gender \nidentity” discrimination.  \nC.  The Department of Education at first tried to implement a \ngender-identity mandate through “guidance” documents. \n98.  Even before promulgating the Rule at issue, ED engaged in other agency \naction to implement President Biden’s Executive Order. \n99.  First,  ED  published  an  interpretation  in  the  Federal  Register, \nEnforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to \nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock \nv. Clayton County, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,637 (June 22, 2021) (“Interpretation”). \n100.  ED concluded that the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX has the \nsame  meaning  as  the  phrase  “because  of …  sex”  in  Title  VII  and  that  this \ninterpretation “is most consistent with the purpose of Title IX.” Id. at 32,638–39. \n101.  Relying on Bostock, ED pledged to enforce its Title IX interpretation and \ndeclared that it “will fully enforce Title IX to prohibit discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity in education programs and activities that receive \nFederal financial assistance from the Department.” Id. at 32,639. \n102.  Second, Acting Assistant Secretary Suzanne B. Goldberg issued a “Dear \nEducator” letter notifying Title IX recipients of the Interpretation and reiterating \nthat  ED  “will  fully  enforce  Title  IX  to  prohibit  discrimination  based  on  sexual \norientation and gender identity.” Letter to Educators on Title IX’s 49th Anniversary \n2 (June 23, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ksLLDj.  \n103.  The Dear Educator letter included a “fact sheet” issued by the Civil \nRights Division of the DOJ and OCR at the Department of Education. U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice & U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A \nResource for Students and Families, https://perma.cc/KA47-U9LJ (“Fact Sheet”). \n14 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 15 of 55   PageID 15\n \n104.  A federal court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the Interpretation \nand the Fact Sheet in 20 states. See Tenn. v. U.S. Dep’t. of Educ., 615 F. Supp. 3d \n807, 838 (E.D. Tenn. 2022), appeal docketed No. 22-5807 (6th Cir. June 13, 2022). \nThat court concluded the challengers were likely to show that the Interpretation was \na legislative Rule under the APA that required notice and comment, which was not \nconducted.  \nD.  The Department of Education issues a new Rule redefining \n“sex” and trampling constitutional rights.   \n105.  Now the agency has undertaken notice-and-comment rulemaking. See \n89 Fed. Reg. 33,474. \n1.  The new definition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” \n106.  Under  the  Rule,  “[d]iscrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  includes \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or \nrelated conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity[.]” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886. \nThis new regulatory demand will appear at 34 C.F.R. § 106.10.  \n107.  The  Department’s  rationale  for  its  definition  comes  straight  from \nBostock: “[D]iscrimination on each of those bases is sex discrimination because each \nnecessarily involves consideration of a person’s sex, even if that term is understood \nto mean only physiological or ‘biological distinctions between male and female.’ ” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,802; see Bostock, 590 U.S. at 659–60 (“If the employer intentionally \nrelies  in  part  on  an  individual  employee’s  sex  when  deciding  to  discharge  the \nemployee—put  differently, if changing  the  employee’s sex  would  have  yielded  a \ndifferent choice by the employer—a statutory violation has occurred.”).  \n108.  The Rule provides for discriminatory-intent liability, disparate-impact \nliability, hostile-environment liability, harassment liability, and other theories of \nliability on recipients of federal financial assistance like Carroll ISD. \n15 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 16 of 55   PageID 16\n \n109.  As the Department’s notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) explained \nit, this provision is intended to codify the Department’s view that “Title IX’s broad \nprohibition on discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ … encompasses, at a minimum, \ndiscrimination against an individual because, for example, they are or are perceived \nto be male, female, or nonbinary; transgender or cisgender; intersex; currently or \npreviously  pregnant;  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  queer,  heterosexual,  or  asexual;  or \ngender-conforming or gender-nonconforming.” Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex \nin Educ. Programs or Activities Receiving Fed. Fin. Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41,390, \n41,532 (proposed July 12, 2022). \n110.  Nothing on this point changed in the final Rule. The Rule says that Title \nIX applies to “discrimination against an individual based on sex stereotypes, sex \ncharacteristics,  pregnancy  or  related  conditions,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender \nidentity”  because  “[a]ll  of  these  classifications  depend,  at  least  in  part,  on \nconsideration of a person’s sex.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,493. \n111.  The new regulatory provisions do not define “sex,” “gender identity,” or \nthe other terms in this new definition. \n112.  As to “sex,” the Rule says, “it is not necessary to resolve the question of \nwhat  ‘sex’  means  in Title IX for  the  Department  to  conclude  that  no statutory \nprovision permits a recipient to discriminate against students … in the context of \nmaintaining certain sex-separate facilities or activities.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,821. \n113.  Nor does the Rule define “gender identity,” though the Rule’s preamble \nsays that ED “understands” the term to “describe an individual’s sense of their \ngender, which may or may not be different from their sex assigned at birth.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,809.  \n114.  The  Rule’s  revised  version  of  34  C.F.R.  § 106.10  treats  the  new \nenumerated bases of liability—sex stereotyping and the like—as overlapping ways in \nwhich Title IX addresses gender identity.  \n16 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 17 of 55   PageID 17\n \n115.  For example, the Rule defines gender-identity discrimination to be sex \ndiscrimination, but the Rule also defines sex-stereotype discrimination to be sex \ndiscrimination,  and  also  considers  sex-stereotype  discrimination  to  encompass \ngender-identity  discrimination.  E.g.,  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  33,807  (“A  person’s \nnonconformity with expectations about … the sex with which they should identify \nimplicate one’s sex, and discrimination on that basis is prohibited.”). Built on this \nframework, the Rule implements Title IX to prohibit educational institutions from \ndistinguishing between persons based on sex in a vast set of circumstances. At the \nsame time, the Rule implements Title IX to require educational institutions to ignore \nsex in favor of a person’s “sense of their gender”—in other words, schools must treat \na boy who identifies as a girl as if he were a girl (and vice versa). When this Complaint \nrefers to the Rule and Defendants’ actions prohibiting discrimination based on gender \nidentity, Plaintiff intends to encompass any alternative theory that Defendants may \nuse to achieve these ends. \n116.  The Rule applies to “all of the operations” of Carroll ISD. 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,883.  \n117.  The Rule thus requires Carroll ISD to treat students and employees \nconsistent with a self-asserted “gender identity,” and do the same with regard to \n“applicants  for  admission  or  employment,”  parents,  “students  from  other \ninstitutions,” “visiting lecturers,” or other community members on campus, including \nvolunteers. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816. \n2.  The new “de minimis harm” standard: gender identity \ncontrols over sex \n118.  The Rule revises 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2) to say:  \nIn the limited circumstances in which Title IX or this part permits \ndifferent treatment or separation on the basis of sex, a recipient must \nnot carry out such different treatment or separation in a manner that \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex by subjecting a person to more than de \n17 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 18 of 55   PageID 18\n \nminimis harm, except as permitted by 20 U.S.C. 1681(a)(1) through (9) \nand the corresponding regulations §§ 106.12 through 106.15, 20 U.S.C. \n1686 and its corresponding regulation § 106.32(b)(1), or § 106.41(b).  \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  \n119.  The Rule then specifies that “[a] policy or… practice that prevents a \nperson from participating in an education program or activity consistent with the \nperson’s gender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis \nof sex.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)) (emphasis \nadded). \n120.  ED’s view is that any consideration of sex presumptively causes harm, \nbut when the statute allows sex-based designation anyway, sex differentiation is \npermissible even though (ED claims) it presumptively causes more than de minimis \nharm. 89 Fed. Reg.33,814–15; see 87 Fed. Reg. at 41,536 (explaining that “regardless \nof whether some students might experience more than de minimis harm if excluded \nfrom  a  particular  sex-separate  living  facility  on  the  basis  of  sex,  Congress  has \nnonetheless permitted that exclusion”). In other words, ED’s interpretation is that \nCongress actually intended to permit “more than de minimis harm” in circumstances \nlike sex-specific “living facilities,” 20 U.S.C. § 1686, or “father-son or mother-daughter \nactivities,” id. § 1681(a)(8).  \n121.  The Rule declares that these new standards apply to sex-designated \nrestrooms and locker rooms, single-sex classes or portions of classes, and dress codes. \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,816. \n122.  The Rule’s preamble states that “§ 106.31(a)(2) does not apply to male \nand female athletic teams a recipient offers under § 106.41(b).” 89 Fed. Reg. 33,816 \n(discussing provision to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). By this, ED implies \nthat  designating  athletic  teams  by  sex  (ignoring  gender  identity)  might  be \npermissible even if it causes “more than de minimis harm.”  \n18 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 19 of 55   PageID 19\n \n123.  This caveat does not protect women’s sports. First, the Rule elsewhere \nsays that gender-identity discrimination is a kind of sex discrimination, 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.10, which requires schools to treat a boy who identifies as a girl as if he were a \ngirl. And the Rule also specifies that “[a] policy or… practice that prevents a person \nfrom participating in an education program or activity consistent with the person’s \ngender identity subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)). \n124.  Second,  section  106.31(a)(2)  exempts  subsection (b)  of  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.41, but not subsection (a). 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. Subsection (a) says, “[n]o \nperson shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated \nagainst in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by \na recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such \nbasis.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a) (2020) (emphasis added); see 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to \nbe codified as 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  \n125.  That means a school risks sex-discrimination liability if a student is \nexcluded from athletics “on the basis of [gender identity],” or “on the basis of [sex \nstereotypes].” The upshot of the Rule is schools may have designated boys’ and girls’ \nteams, but must let a male onto the girls’ team if he identifies himself as a girl. Thus, \nin practice under the Rule, schools cannot maintain teams that are truly designated \nby sex.  \n126.  This requirement tracks what the Biden administration has elsewhere \nstated about Title IX’s mandates. DOJ has recently and repeatedly argued that, \nunder existing 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), student-athletes must be able to participate \nbased on their gender identity rather than their sex. E.g., Br. for the United States \nas Amicus Curiae in Supp. of Pl.-Appellant and Urging Reversal at 24–27, B.P.J. v. \nW. Va. State Bd. of Educ., Nos. 23-1078, 23-1130 (4th Cir. April 3, 2023); Statement \n19 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 20 of 55   PageID 20\n \nof Interest of the United States at 1, 7, B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-\ncv-00316 (S.D. W. Va. June 17, 2021), ECF No. 42. \n127.  Even if the Rule does not require gender-identity-based athletics, the \nInterpretation and the Fact Sheet do. See supra ¶¶ 98–104. \n3.  The new definition of “sex-based harassment” tramples \nconstitutional rights. \n128.  The current regulations implement the Supreme Court’s definition of \nhostile-environment harassment: “[u]nwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable \nperson to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a \nperson  equal access  to  the  recipient’s education program  or activity.”  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.30(a)(2); accord Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 \nU.S. 629, 652 (1999).  \n129.  In 2020, ED appropriately recognized that First Amendment protections \nrequired a “narrowly tailored” harassment definition to avoid censoring protected \nspeech. 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,142.  \n130.  The Rule prohibits “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the \ntotality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe \nor pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from \nthe recipient’s education program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment).” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,884 (34 C.F.R. § 106.2). \n131.  ED  admits  that  its  hostile-environment  harassment  definition  is \n“broader” than the 2020 rule and the Davis standard. 89 Fed Reg. at 33,498. \n132.  The Rule’s definition is “broader” than the Davis definition in two ways: \na.  It prohibits conduct that “limits” a person’s “ability to participate \nin or benefit from” a program or activity, rather than “denies” a \nperson  “access  to  the  educational  opportunities  or  benefits \nprovided  by  the  school.”  As  ED  summarizes,  the  definition \n20 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 21 of 55   PageID 21\n \nrequires  only  “some  impact  on”  complainants’  “ability  to \nparticipate or benefit from the education program or activity, but \nthe definition does not specify any particular limits or denials.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,511; and \nb.  It prohibits conduct that is “severe or pervasive,” rather than \n“severe and pervasive.”  \n133.  Thus, prohibited harassment extends even to a “single serious” incident \nthat merely “limits” someone’s ability to participate in an educational program. 89 \nFed. Reg. at 33,500.  \n134.  The Rule applies its definition of hostile-environment harassment in two \nother, “broader” ways compared to the current regulations: \na.  It requires recipients to “promptly and effectively end any sex \ndiscrimination,”  regardless  of  whether  they  had  “actual \nknowledge”  of  hostile-environment  harassment  or  were \ndeliberately indifferent to it. 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 (34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.44(f)(1)); and \nb.  It requires recipients to police off-campus, non-school “conduct \nthat is subject to the recipient’s disciplinary authority” even if it \noccurs “outside the United States.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,886 (34 \nC.F.R. § 106.11). That includes speech “on social media.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 33,535.  \n135.  ED is already applying this broader definition. It recently asked Carroll \nISD to enter a resolution agreement of Title IX complaints involving allegations of \nsexual-orientation harassment including from social media interactions.  \n21 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 22 of 55   PageID 22\n \n4.  The Rule removes crucial procedural protections \nnecessary to protect First Amendment freedoms.  \n136.  ED’s regulations currently require a “formal complaint” to initiate the \ngrievance process and prohibit recipients from “restrict[ing] the ability of either party \nto  discuss  the  allegations  under  investigation.”  34  C.F.R.  §§ 106.44(b), \n106.45(b)(5)(iii).  \n137.  The Rule eliminates these two key procedural protections: \na.  It allows the recipient’s Title IX coordinator to initiate a grievance \nprocess even in “the absence of a complaint or the withdrawal of \nany or all of the allegations in a complaint.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,889 \n(34 C.F.R. § 106.44(f)(1)(v)). If the Title IX coordinator makes the \n“fact-specific determination” that “the conduct as alleged presents \nan imminent and serious threat to the health or safety of the \ncomplainant  or  other  person,  or  that  the  conduct  as  alleged \nprevents the recipient from ensuring equal access” to education, \nthe Title IX Coordinator “may initiate a complaint.” Id. \nb.  It requires recipients like Carroll ISD to “take reasonable steps to \nprotect  the  privacy  of  the  parties  and  witnesses  during  the \npendency  of  a  recipient’s  grievance  process”  (the  “gag  order \nrequirement”). 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,891 (34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(5)).  \n138.  The Rule as a whole transforms the ability of the Title IX coordinator to \ninitiate a complaint sua sponte into an obligation.  \n139.  Self-initiation of complaints coupled with the recipient’s duty to “end” \nthe Department’s expanded interpretation of “sex” discrimination (without an actual-\nknowledge or deliberate-indifference requirement), forces Title IX coordinators to \ninvestigate claims of even single instances of protected speech or rumors about \nalleged conduct.  \n22 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 23 of 55   PageID 23\n \n140.  The Title IX Coordinator must also account for threats to “health or \nsafety” without any limitation to physical health or safety.  \n141.  Many today claim that protected speech threatens mental, emotional, \nand physical safety. E.g., Perlot v. Green, 609 F. Supp. 3d 1106, 1114 (D. Idaho 2022) \n(student  claimed  professor’s  agreement  with  comments  that  the  Bible  reserves \nmarriage to be between one man and one woman “caused [her] to fear for [her] life”); \nDoe v. Univ. of Idaho, No. 1:23-cv-00409-AKB, ECF No. 24 (D. Idaho Dec. 29, 2023) \n(Title IX lawsuit based in part on this event).   \n142.  The requirement will force Title IX coordinators to begin time- and \nresource-intensive  procedures  against  students  and  employees  based  on  their \nprotected speech, even in the absence of a complaint from the purported victim, or \nthe school district will face enforcement action and private lawsuits.  \n143.  The  gag  order  requirement  forces  recipients  like  Carroll  ISD  to \ncategorically issue gag orders to the parties during any grievance process.  \n144.  It will prevent the parties—either complainants or respondents—from \ndiscussing perceived shortcomings or seeking assistance in the grievance process, \nwhich was a central concern of the 2020 regulations. 85 Fed. Reg. 30,295.  \n145.  It mandates recipients like Carroll ISD “impose prior restraints on \nstudents’ and employees’ ability to discuss (i.e., speak or write about) the allegations \nunder investigation” or face enforcement actions and private lawsuits. 85 Fed. Reg. \nat 30,295. \nE.  The Rule contradicts Title IX’s text and history. \n146.  Although Title IX does not define “sex” or “on the basis of sex,” Title IX’s \nplain text, history, and past application all prove that these terms refer to sex \naccording to biology, not “gender identity.”  \n147.  The dictionary definition of the term “sex” has never—including when \nTitle IX was enacted in 1972—meant “gender identity” as that term is used in the \n23 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 24 of 55   PageID 24\n \nRule. Instead, the word “sex” refers to the biological binary of male and female, or to \nthe physiological and biological differences between male and female.  \n148.  For decades, Title IX has been understood to allow distinctions by sex. \nRecognizing the biological differences between males and females is necessary to \nachieving Title IX’s policy goal of promoting educational opportunity for women. \n149.  Title IX specifies that it cannot be construed to prevent sex separation \nin “living facilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. ED has long implemented that statutory \nmandate in regulations to permit “separate … [h]ousing,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.32(b)(1), as \nwell as “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \n150.  The Rule eviscerates Title IX’s respect for the biological differences \nbetween male and female by requiring schools to categorize students in line with their \nself-asserted “gender identity” while ignoring their sex. \n151.  The Rule also erases Title IX’s longstanding recognition that sex in the \nhuman species is binary. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(2) (“both sexes”); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.32(c)(2)  (referring  to  “housing …  provided  to  students  of  one  sex,  when \ncompared to that provided to students of the other sex”). \n152.  For  example,  the  Rule  revises  34  C.F.R.  § 106.21  by  replacing  the \nstatutory term “both sexes” with the term “all applicants.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887. \nThe notice of proposed rulemaking said that this change was “in recognition of the \nfact that some applicants may have a nonbinary gender identity.” 87 Fed. Reg. at \n41,517, 41,528. The final Rule’s preamble continues to refer to the concept of a \n“nonbinary” gender. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 33807. \n153.  That reasoning conflicts with the statute. Title IX’s statutory text and \nits implementing regulations—until now—have used “sex” to mean the biological \nbinary of male and female.  \n154.  Redefining  discrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  to  include  “gender \nidentity” will preclude school policies and practices that recognize sex to equalize \n24 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 25 of 55   PageID 25\n \nopportunity, ensure privacy, and safeguard students, such as designating restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and school sports teams based on biological sex.  \nIII.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet injure Carroll ISD. \n155.  The Rule takes effect on August 1, 2024. It will impose immediate and \nlong-lasting harm on Carroll ISD as well as its staff and students and their parents.  \nA.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet create new liability \nrisks for Carroll ISD. \n156.  The Rule creates new risks for Carroll ISD because it could lose federal \nfunding, incur significant burdens and costs, or face liability. \n157.  Failure to follow the Rule and its interpretation of Title IX risks the \nburdens and costs of federal investigations and enforcement proceedings. \n158.  Failure  to  follow  the  Rule  and  its  interpretation  of  Title  IX  risks \ndisallowance, exclusion, suspension, and debarment from receipt of federal funding. \n159.  Failure to follow the Rule and its interpretation of Title IX risks liability \nfor Carroll ISD under a cause of action in civil litigation, including in suits brought \nby private individuals. Additionally, Title IX complaints have already been filed \nagainst Carroll ISD and other Texas school districts under the interpretation that \n“sex” includes “gender identity” and “sexual orientation.”  \n160.  ED requires any applicant for federal funds to assure that its programs \n“will be operated … in compliance” with Title IX and its implementing regulations \nand to “commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary … to eliminate \nexisting  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  or  to  eliminate  the  effects  of  past \ndiscrimination.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.4(a) \n161.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet directly conflict with Texas law \non sports. This collision forces Carroll ISD to choose between, on the one hand, \nfollowing what the Rule demands on sports in violation of Texas law and, on the other \n25 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 26 of 55   PageID 26\n \nhand, ignoring what the Rule says to comply with Texas law. Either way, Carroll ISD \nis exposed to liability.  \n162.  Texas law protects female sports: “[A]n interscholastic athletic team \nsponsored or authorized by a school district … may not allow a student to compete in \nan interscholastic athletic competition sponsored or authorized by the district … that \nis designated for the biological sex opposite to the student’s biological sex.” Tex. Educ. \nCode § 33.0834(a).  \n163.  If Carroll ISD disregarded this law, its athletic teams could not compete \nagainst other teams in the University Interscholastic League (UIL).  \n164.  At least 23 other states have similar laws. See Ala. Code § 16-1-52(b)(2) \n(2023);  Alaska  Admin.  Code  tit.  4,  § 06.115(b)(5)(D)  (2023);  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat. \n§ 15-120.02  (2022);  Ark. Code  §  6-1-107(b)–(c)  (2021);  Fla.  Stat.  § 1006.205(3)(a) \n(2021); Idaho Code § 33-6203(1) (2020); Ind. Code § 20-33-13-4 (2022); Iowa Code \n§ 261I.2 (2022); Kan. Stat. § 60-5603 (2023); Ky. Rev. Stat. § 156.070(g) (2022); La. \nStat. Ann. § 4:444 (2022); Miss. Code §§ 37-97-1 to 37-97-5 (2021); Mo. Rev. Stat. \n§ 163.048 (2023); Mont. Code § 20-7-1306 (2023); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 116-401 (2023); \nN.D. Cent. Code § 15-10.6-02 (2023); Okla. Stat. tit. 70, § 27-106 (2022); S.C. Code \n§ 59-1-500 (2022); S.D. Codified Laws § 13-67-1 (2022); Tenn. Code § 49-6-310 (2022); \nUtah Code § 53G-6-902 (2022); W. Va. Code § 18-2-25d (2021); Wyo. Stat. § 21-25-102 \n(2023).  \n165.  These laws align with Title IX’s text and the ED guidance issued and \nenforcement actions taken in the first four decades of Title IX’s existence. \n166.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet’s requirement that schools \nallow students to participate on sex-specific sports teams according to gender identity \nconflicts with Texas law.  \n167.  But the Rule states that a recipient’s “obligation to comply [with the \nRule] is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement.” \n26 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 27 of 55   PageID 27\n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 (to be codified at 28 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)); see also id. at 33,805–\n06. \n168.  Carroll ISD’s policy and practice are to comply with all Texas laws, \nincluding its law to protect female sports. The Rule threatens to require Carroll ISD \nto violate state law as a condition of receiving any federal funds.  \n169.  Disregarding Texas law threatens Carroll ISD’s state funds—funds that \nmake up a significant portion of the board’s annual budget. \nB.  The Rule imposes immediate, ongoing compliance costs. \n170.  Under the Rule, as a condition of continuing to accept federal funding \nfor education, Carroll ISD must begin immediately to repeal existing policies, adopt \nnew policies, make assurances to the federal government, and train staff to comply \nwith the Rule’s new mandates. Carroll ISD will have to spend time and resources \nfulfilling these requirements.  \n171.  ED concedes that “all regulated entities will experience an increased \nrecordkeeping burden under the final regulations,” acknowledges that “recipients \nwould be required to address more complaints,” projects “a 10 percent increase in the \nnumber of investigations conducted annually,” and admits that the Rule “could result \nin increased costs to recipients.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,881, 33,492, 33,850, 33,877. \n172.  Covered educational institutions must agree to comply with the Rule, \nincluding the prohibition on discrimination on the basis of gender identity. \n173.  The  Rule  requires  covered  entities  to  provide  a  notice  of \nnondiscrimination stating that they will not discriminate on the basis of gender \nidentity. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(a), (b). Carroll ISD will have to spend time and \nresources on these notices.  \n174.  The  Rule  prohibits  covered  institutions  from  stating  that  they  will \nengage  in  actions  or  omissions  inconsistent  with  the  Rule’s  prohibitions  on \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(b)(2)(ii).  \n27 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 28 of 55   PageID 28\n \n175.  Under  the  Rule,  covered  institutions  must  train  current  and  new \nemployees on the Rule’s required policies and procedures. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,885 \n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(d)).  \n176.  The Rule will require careful review of and changes to Carroll ISD’s \npolicies and practices.  \n177.  Carroll ISD’s policies reflect Title IX’s use of the term “sex” to mean the \nbiological binary between males and females.  \n178.  For  example,  Carroll  ISD  Policy  3.19  requires  “separate  restrooms, \nlocker rooms, and other similar facilities” to be used in accord with biological sex. Ex. \nA at 1. Under the Rule, Carroll ISD will have to repeal Policy 3.19. Carroll ISD will \nhave to spend time and resources on these changes. Changing Policy 3.19 to comply \nwith the Rule will prevent Carroll ISD from protecting vulnerable students.  \n179.  As another example, Carroll ISD Policy 6.9 protects the right of students \nand employees not to use pronouns inconsistent with a person’s sex. Ex. B at 1. Under \nthe  Rule,  failure  to  use  pronouns  consistent  with  sex  can  constitute  hostile-\nenvironment  harassment.  Carroll  ISD  will  have  to  spend  time  and  resources \nchanging its policy. Changing Policy 6.9 to comply with the Rule will require Carroll \nISD to violate the constitutional rights of its students and staff.  \n180.  Carroll ISD would maintain each of these existing policies and practices \nwithout the Rule. The cost of amending these policies is an injury to Carroll ISD.  \n181.  At least 3 students have identified as a gender identity that differs from \ntheir sex. Under the Rule, Carroll ISD must immediately allow these students to \n“participate in” school programs and activities “consistent with their gender identity.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 33,887 (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.31(a)(2)).  \n182.  At a minimum, that will require that these students immediately be \nallowed to use opposite-sex locker rooms, restrooms, and other sex-designated spaces \nconsistent with their gender identity. That would violate Carrol ISD Policy 3.19.  \n28 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 29 of 55   PageID 29\n \nC.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet will harm Carroll \nISD’s students, parents, and employees. \n183.  On May 6, Carroll ISD’s board adopted a resolution denouncing the \nRule. Ex. C at 1.  \n184.  The resolution emphasized that the Rule could “jeopardiz[e] the safety \nand well-being of students in” Carroll ISD. Id. \n185.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet prevent Carroll ISD from \nprotecting private spaces, athletics, and the constitutional rights of its students and \nemployees.  \n186.  Allowing students to access sex-specific private spaces like locker rooms \naccording to their gender identity effectively eliminates the sex designation in those \nspaces. \n187.  Carroll ISD has determined that eliminating these sex-specific private \nspaces violates students’ fundamental rights of privacy and safety.  \n188.  Carroll ISD designates such spaces by sex—meaning biological sex. \nMales do not enter the girls’ locker rooms, restrooms, or showers; likewise, females \ndo not enter the boys’ locker rooms, restrooms, or showers.  \n189.  The presence of opposite-sex students in these spaces deprives children \nof privacy and threatens their personal sense of safety and security. These harms are \nmore than de minimis, but the Rule disregards them.  \n190.  The  Rule  requires  Carroll  ISD  to  allow  adults,  such  as  parent \nvolunteers, chaperones, teachers, and coaches, to access private spaces consistent \nwith their gender identities. That harms students as well as other adults forced to \nshare private spaces with a person of the opposite sex. These harms are more than \nde minimis, but the Rule disregards them. \n191.  Requiring students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers in the \npresence  of  the  opposite  sex  also  deprives  them  of  access  to  equal  educational \n29 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 30 of 55   PageID 30\n \nopportunity. Allowing males into spaces reserved for girls subjects girls to distress \nand embarrassment, at best, and an increased risk of harassment or assault, at worst. \nPreventing girls from accessing educational opportunities on equal terms violates \nTitle IX. \n192.  Carroll ISD’s athletic programs and female athletes will also be harmed \nby the Rule, the Interpretation, and the Fact Sheet because schools must allow boys \nwho identify as girls to participate on the girls’ sports teams.  \n193.  This undermines the privacy and safety of the girls on those sports \nteams. These harms are more than de minimis, but the Rule disregards them. \n194.  Athletics provides female students with countless advantages. Athletic \nparticipation  is  associated  with  positive  educational  outcomes,  including  better \nattendance, higher grades, fewer disciplinary issues, a greater desire to go to college, \nand higher advanced placement enrollment rates. Girls who participate in sports are \nmore confident and have higher self-esteem.  \n195.  Participating in high school sports can provide girls with opportunities \nfor athletic scholarships in college. These athletic scholarships lower the cost of \nhigher education and provide other benefits including access to medical facilities, \nhealth benefits, travel expenses, and gear such as shoes, clothes, and bags. \n196.  The Rule, the Interpretation, and the Fact Sheet threaten to reduce \nsubstantially the benefits of athletics to female student-athletes by requiring them to \ncompete against males who identify as girls for spots on their school’s teams and then \nto compete against males on opposing schools’ female athletic teams. \n197.  Males have physiological athletic advantages over similarly fit females, \nincluding in the respiratory, cardiovascular, muscular, and other systems. These \nadvantages result in higher short-term and sustained levels of oxygen to transport to \nthe muscles and increased muscle fibers and muscle mass.  \n30 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 31 of 55   PageID 31\n \n198.  The physiological differences between males and females directly result \nin  stark  disparities  in  the  athletic  record  books  because  boys  and  men  can \nconsistently run faster and jump higher and farther than comparably fit girls and \nwomen. \n199.  When males compete in female events, gifted and dedicated female \nathletes are denied the equal athletic opportunity that Title IX guarantees by being \nforced  to  compete  against  male  athletes  who  have  inherent  and  immutable \nadvantages. \n200.  Physiological differences between the two sexes, combined with basic \nprinciples of physics, also create enhanced risks of injury—and more severe injuries—\nfor  female  athletes  when  competing  against  male  athletes  than  in  competition \ninvolving female athletes only.  \n201.  Increasing  numbers  of  boys  and  men  are  competing  and  trying  to \ncompete in female sports and depriving girls and women of athletic opportunities and \naccomplishments. For example, in Connecticut, two males competing in girls’ high \nschool track and field won 15 women’s state championship titles—titles previously \nheld by nine different girls.  \n202.  Providing  physical  education  and  athletic  opportunities  is  part  of \nCarroll ISD’s educational mission.  \n203.  If Carroll ISD were to comply with the Rule, its schools would risk losing \nstudents to private schools that are not required to comply with the Rule and thus \ncan recognize the biological differences between boys and girls, including as they \nrelate to athletics.  \nIV.  The Rule infringes on the constitutional rights of students and \nemployees. \n204.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free exercise \nof religion and free speech rights of all.  \n31 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 32 of 55   PageID 32\n \n205.  By rewriting Title IX to include “gender identity,” the Rule threatens \nthe First Amendment rights of all students and employees in Carroll ISD.  \n206.  The Rule requires Carroll ISD to implement content and viewpoint \ndiscriminatory policies that impose overbroad and vague restrictions on speech.  \n207.  The  Rule  requires  Carroll  ISD  to  implement  policies  that \nunconstitutionally compel speech.  \n208.  The Rule’s “broader” definition and its expansive interpretation of “sex” \nforce Carroll ISD to violate students’ and employees’ First Amendment freedoms by \nrequiring the district to: \na.  Regulate even single instances of speech, including speech on the \nimportant  topics  of  gender  identity  and  protecting  women’s \nsports. \nb.  Police  off-campus  and  even  international  speech  despite  the \nSupreme Court’s admonition that “courts must be more skeptical \nof a school’s efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so \nmay mean the student cannot engage in that kind of speech at \nall.” Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v B.L., 594 U.S. 180, 189–90 (2021).  \nc.  Mandate that students and employees use “pronouns and names \nconsistent with a transgender student’s gender identity” and not \nbased  on  the  student’s  sex.  2016  Letter  at  3.  Indeed,  ED \nrepeatedly  and  approvingly  cites  a  district  court  decision \nupholding  a  K-12  school  district’s  ban  on  using  pronouns \nconsistent with a student’s sex. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,504, 33,506 \n(citing Parents Defending Educ. v. Olentangy Loc. Sch. Dist., 2023 \nWL 4848509, at *2, 16 (S.D. Ohio July 28, 2023)). The Biden \nadministration has consistently taken the position that failing to \nuse opposite-sex names or pronouns is discriminatory under Title \n32 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 33 of 55   PageID 33\n \nVII and section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act—a statute that \nincorporates  Title  IX.  See,  e.g.,  U.S.  Equal  Employment \nOpportunity Commission, Fact Sheet: Notable EEOC Litigation \nRegarding  Title  VII  &  Discrimination  Based  on  Sexual \nOrientation and Gender Identity, https://bit.ly/3RrIkwv. \n209.  The  Rule  chills  speech  in  favor  of  the  religious  and  traditional \nunderstanding that sex is binary or against the practice of transitioning a child to a \ngender identity that does not conform with his or her sex. There is a substantial risk \nthat students and staff will refrain from voicing their views on these important topics \nor will simply acquiesce in using pronouns or names inconsistent with sex out of fear \nthey will be accused of and punished for discriminatory harassment.  \n210.  The risk of such self-censorship is real. In schools that have adopted \npolicies treating gender identity as “sex” for purposes of sex discrimination, teachers \nhave faced discipline for refusing to use pronouns inconsistent with sex because this \nallegedly constitutes “sex-based” harassment or discrimination. See, e.g., Ricard v. \nUSD 475 Geary Cnty. Sch. Bd., No. 5:22-cv-04015, 2022 WL 1471372, at *1 (D. Kan. \nMay 9, 2022); Geraghty v. Jackson Loc. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., Complaint, ECF 1, \nNo. 5:22-cv-2237 (N.D. Ohio Dec. 12, 2022).  \n211.  Requiring staff and students to participate in social transition by using \npronouns and names inconsistent with a student’s sex, for example, infringes on their \nFirst Amendment right to be free from compelled speech.  \n212.  Public school teachers do not surrender their First Amendment rights \nas a condition of serving the public. See Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968). \nTheir  speech  as  citizens  on  matters  of  public  concern  is  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment. \n213.  A teacher’s refusal to participate in a social transition through speech is \nconstitutionally protected activity because refraining from participating in social \n33 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 34 of 55   PageID 34\n \ntransition implicates the teacher’s interests as a private citizen, speech associated \nwith  social  transition  implicates  matters  of  urgent  public  concern,  and  the \ngovernment has no interest that could outweigh a teacher’s First Amendment rights. \nSee Meriwether v. Hartop, 992 F.3d 492, 506 (6th Cir. 2021). \n214.  A  public  school  cannot  “treat[ ]  everything  teachers …  say  in  the \nworkplace  as  government  speech  subject  to  government  control.”  Kennedy  v. \nBremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 530–31 (2022). Endorsing the administration’s \npreferred gender ideology is not part of an educator’s job duties, and refraining from \ndoing so is protected.  \n215.  The Rule threatens Carroll ISD with Title IX liability unless it compels \nstaff to speak consistent with the Biden administration’s preferred ideology about the \nnature of sex. At the same time, the Rule threatens Title IX liability unless Carroll \nISD enacts content and viewpoint discriminatory and overbroad policies about sex-\nbased harassment that chill protected speech.  \n216.  Because the Rule requires Carroll ISD to treat protected expression as \nif it were sex-based harassment, the Rule would force Carroll ISD to amend its \npolicies to violate the constitutional rights of students and employees and to chill wide \nswaths of protected speech.  \n217.  The Rule also requires Carroll ISD to categorically issue gag orders \nduring grievance proceedings.  \n218.  Those  gag  orders  impose  prior  restraints  which  are  presumptively \nunconstitutional.  \n219.  To pass constitutional muster, gag orders must have both substantive \nand procedural safeguards.  \n220.  The Rule requires Carroll ISD to issue gag orders with no substantive \nor procedural safeguards, which violates the free speech rights of those students and \n34 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 35 of 55   PageID 35\n \nemployees  subject  to  the  gag  orders.  See,  e.g.,  Perlot,  609  F.  Supp.  3d  1106 \n(preliminarily enjoining Title IX office’s imposition of no-contact orders). \n221.  The Rule also both censors and compels student speech on issues of \ngender identity and the immutability of sex, in violation of students’ beliefs.  \nV.  Carroll ISD needs urgent judicial relief to prevent irreparable harm. \n222.  All the acts of Defendants described above, and their officers, agents, \nemployees,  and  servants,  were  executed  and  are  continuing  to  be  executed  by \nDefendants  under  the  color  and  pretense  of  the  policies,  statutes,  ordinances, \nregulations, customs, and usages of the United States. \n223.  The  Rule  is  “[a]gency  action  made  reviewable  by  statute  and  final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n224.  No statute precludes judicial review of the Rule, and the Rule is not \ncommitted to agency discretion by law under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a). \n225.  The  Interpretation  and  the  Fact  Sheet  are  “[a]gency  action  made \nreviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n226.  No statute precludes judicial review of the Interpretation and the Fact \nSheet, and they are  not committed to agency discretion by law under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a). \n227.  Carroll ISD has no adequate or available administrative remedy.  \n228.  In the alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would \nbe futile. \n229.  Carroll ISD suffers legal wrong and harm from the Rule, Interpretation, \nand Fact Sheet.  \n230.  Carroll ISD is a regulated party under the Rule, Interpretation, and \nFact Sheet. \n35 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 36 of 55   PageID 36\n \n231.  The Rule, Interpretation, and Fact Sheet are definitive and determine \nthe rights and obligations of persons, including Carroll ISD. \n232.  ED declares that the Rule has the full force of law. \n233.  Carroll ISD faces imminent irreparable harm and is susceptible to risk \nof enforcement under the Rule beginning on its effective date. \n234.  Carroll  ISD’s  compliance  costs  constitute  ongoing  irreparable  harm \ncaused by the Rule. Carroll ISD has no way to obtain monetary compensation from \nthe federal government for its compliance costs. ED itself has estimated compliance \ncosts from “reviewing and making necessary changes to policies, procedures, and \ntraining to implement the final regulations” nationwide will exceed $98 million in the \nfirst year. 89 Fed. Reg. 33,861. \n235.  Absent  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  granted  before  the  Rule’s \neffective date, Carroll ISD has been and will continue to be harmed by the Rule’s \nimmediate, ongoing compliance costs and by continued exposure to legal penalties if \nit fails to adopt policies that align with the Rule’s mandates. \n236.  Carroll ISD has no adequate remedy at law. \n237.  The equities favor Carroll ISD’s request for injunctive relief or vacatur, \nwhich will maintain the status quo that has been in place for five decades.  \nFIRST COUNT \nRULE—CONTRARY TO STATUTE \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 28 U.S.C. § 2201) \n238.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint.  \n239.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1).  \n240.  Under the APA, a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” if the agency action is “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory \n36 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 37 of 55   PageID 37\n \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity” under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n241.  The  Rule  is  not  in  accordance  with  law  and  exceeds  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, and limitations in many respects. \n242.  Title IX uses the word “sex” to mean the biological, binary distinction \nbetween male and female. Title IX repeatedly imposes an approach to educational \nopportunity that is cognizant of two sexes and their differences, using such terms as \n“both sexes” and the “opposite sex.”  \n243.  The  Rule  imposes  an  approach  irreconcilable  with  the  statute.  It \nrequires schools to adopt a “nonbinary” approach to sex discrimination and sex \ndifferences. This rewrites the statute from one requiring equal opportunity for both \nsexes (often through the explicit consideration of sex differences) into one requiring \nequal opportunity based on gender identity. At the same time, the Rule requires equal \ntreatment based on “nonbinary” or “asexual” gender identities—classifications that \nare defined without reference to a person’s sex.  \n244.  Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex” while specifically \nallowing distinctions based on sex differences to achieve equal opportunity. That \nprohibition does  not  include  discrimination “on  the  basis of gender  identity”  as \ndistinct from an individual’s sex.  \n245.  Congress has not delegated to Defendants the authority to prohibit \ngender-identity discrimination under Title IX.  \n246.  Title IX expressly contemplates sex-specific educational programs. E.g., \n20 U.S.C. § 1686 (separate living facilities). The statute does not permit educational \ninstitutions to ignore sex in favor of gender identity.  \n247.  The Rule’s gender-identity mandates make the statute nonsensical and \nunworkable. Under the Rule, students who claim a gender identity different from \ntheir sex could claim unlawful discrimination based on both gender identity and sex. \n37 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 38 of 55   PageID 38\n \nFor  example,  consider  a  male  student  who  identifies  as  a  girl.  It  would  be \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex to exclude this student from boys’ locker rooms, but \nit would also be discrimination on the basis of gender identity to exclude this student \nfrom the girls’ locker rooms. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.33. The student can demand access \nanywhere. \n248.  ED’s “de minimis harm” standard is not found in the statutory text and \ngoes against the rule of construction in 20 U.S.C. § 1686.  \n249.  Substantive canons of statutory construction preclude reading Title IX’s \nreferences to “sex” to include “gender identity” that differs from a person’s biology.  \nClear Statement Rule \n250.  A clear statement is necessary for a statute to preempt the historical \npolice powers of the States, to abrogate state sovereign immunity, or to permit an \nagency  to  regulate  a  matter  in  areas  of  traditional  state  responsibility.  This  is \nespecially true when Congress conditions such a change in the balance of federal and \nstate power on the receipt of federal funding. \n251.  A clear statement is needed to displace the states’ traditional authority \nover public education, which includes retaining sex designation in sports, as well as \nin school restroom facilities, locker room facilities, and shower facilities. When Title \nIX was enacted in 1972, the public lacked clear notice that Title IX would apply in \nthe way mandated by the Rule. The clear statement rule therefore precludes ED from \ninterpreting Title IX to include the Rule’s redefinition of “sex.” \n252.  The  Rule  threatens  to  override  state  laws,  including  Texas’s  law \nprotecting female sports. \nMajor Questions Doctrine \n253.  The major questions doctrine also precludes reading “on the basis of sex” \nin Title IX to include the gender-identity mandates created by the Rule.  \n38 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 39 of 55   PageID 39\n \n254.  Title IX’s statutory text respects the biological differences between male \nand female. When biological differences matter, Title IX respects them by permitting \nsex-designated programs offered on equal terms. That includes housing, restroom \nfacilities, locker room facilities, shower facilities, and sports.     \n255.  If Congress wanted to require schools to ignore biological differences for \nstudents who identify themselves with a different gender identity, it would have said \nso  openly.  Title  IX,  which  is  filled  with  references  to  the  inherent  biological \ndifferences between male and female, cannot be read to give administrative agencies \nlike ED authority to mandate that schools ignore the biological distinctiveness of girls \nand boys.  \nConditional Spending \n256.  When Congress imposes conditions on acceptance of federal funds under \nthe Spending Clause, the Constitution limits the States’ and the public’s obligations \nto those requirements “unambiguously” set out on the face of the statute. Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). \n257.  No funding recipient could unmistakably know or clearly understand \nthat Title IX would impose the gender-identity mandates created by the Rule as a \ncondition of accepting federal funds from ED. \n258.  The public lacked the constitutionally required clear notice that the Act \nwould apply in this way when Title IX was passed or when funding grants were made. \nBennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985). \n259.  As a result, the Rule must be held unlawful and set aside under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. \n260.  The  Rule  must  also  be  enjoined  and  declared  unenforceable  under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 to preserve status and rights pending review of this Court. \n39 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 40 of 55   PageID 40\n \nSECOND COUNT \nRULE—INFRINGES ON CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 28 U.S.C. § 2201; ULTRA VIRES) \n261.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint. \n262.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n263.  Under the APA, a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” if the agency action is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity” under 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n264.  A court has equitable jurisdiction to review and enjoin ultra vires or \nunconstitutional agency action. See Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \n265.  Carroll ISD has standing to challenge the Rule because the Rule forces \nit to choose between respecting individuals’ constitutional rights and complying with \nfederal law. See Bd. of Educ. of Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 241 n.5 \n(1968) (school board had standing because the challenged law compelled members to \n“choose between violating their oath [to uphold the Constitution] and taking a step—\nrefusal to comply with [the law]—that would be likely to bring their expulsion from \noffice and also a reduction in state funds for their school districts”). \n266.  Carroll ISD has standing to vindicate the rights of staff and students \nunder  the  First  Amendment  overbreadth  doctrine.  See  Speech  First,  Inc.  v. \nCartwright, 32 F.4th 1110, 1122 (11th Cir. 2022). \n267.  Carroll  ISD  has  third-party  standing  to  vindicate  the  rights  of  its \nstudents and its employees. Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129–30 (2004). Carroll \nISD is directly injured by the Rule because, as an educational institution that receives \nfederal funding through ED, it is the object of the regulation.  \n268.  Carroll ISD shares a close relationship with its students and employees \nand can effectively advocate for their constitutional rights. See Washington v. Trump, \n40 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 41 of 55   PageID 41\n \n847 F.3d 1151, 1160 (9th Cir. 2017); Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d \n1480, 1487 (9th Cir. 1995).  \n269.  Students  and  staff  face  obstacles  that  bar  them  from  effectively \nadvocating for their constitutional rights. Among other things, asserting their First \nAmendment rights on the hotly charged issue of gender identity subjects them to \nharassment and ostracization.  \n270.  The Rule’s treatment of speech as discriminatory harassment will likely \ncreate “self-censorship and chilling of expression” by staff and students, Clark v. City \nof Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1010 (9th Cir. 2001), making it appropriate for Carroll \nISD to represent their interests.  \n271.  Under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, “Congress shall \nmake no law…abridging the freedom of speech…or the right of the people peaceably \n       \nto assemble….” U.S. Const. amend. I. The First Amendment applies to the States and \n \nto Carroll ISD as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n272.  Students’ speech is protected by the First Amendment.  \n273.  Employees’ speech on matters of public concern is protected by the First \nAmendment.  \n274.  The Rule restricts and compels employee and student speech in violation \nof the First Amendment. \n275.  The Rule would require Carroll ISD to adopt policies that both restrict \nand  compel  staff  and  student  speech  in  violation  of  the  First  Amendment  as \nincorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n276.  The Rule is so vague and overbroad that it will chill protected expression \nthat disagrees with ED and DOJ’s view about the meaning of sex: “[M]any persons, \nrather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating \ntheir rights …will choose simply to abstain from protected speech—harming not only \n \n41 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 42 of 55   PageID 42\n \nthemselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace \nof ideas.” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119 (2003) (citation omitted). \n277.  Adopting policies required by the Rule exposes Carroll ISD to lawsuits \nand liability for violating individuals’ First Amendment rights. \n278.  Students  also  have  a  constitutionally  protected  privacy  interest  in \npreventing persons of the opposite sex from seeing their unclothed or partially clothed \nbodies. See, e.g., Brannum v. Overton Cnty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 495 (6th Cir. \n2008). The Rule forces Carroll ISD to open restrooms, locker rooms, and shower \nfacilities  to  students  of  the  opposite  sex,  which  violates  that  protected  privacy \ninterest.  \n279.  The  Rule  is  contrary  to  law  because  ED  lacks  authority  to  compel \nfunding recipients to violate individuals’ constitutional rights.  \n280.  As a result, the Rule must be held unlawful and set aside under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706  and  the  Court’s  inherent  equitable  power  to  enjoin  ultra  vires  and \nunconstitutional actions. \n281.  The  Rule  must  also  be  enjoined  and  declared  unenforceable  under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 to preserve status and rights pending review of this Court. \nTHIRD COUNT \nRULE—EXCEEDS FEDERAL POWER \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 28 U.S.C. § 2201; ULTRA VIRES) \n282.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint. \n283.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n284.  Under the APA, a court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” if the agency action is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity” under 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n42 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 43 of 55   PageID 43\n \n285.  A court has equitable jurisdiction to review and enjoin ultra vires or \nunconstitutional agency action. Larson, 337 U.S. at 689–91. \n286.  Even if ED’s interpretation of Title IX were a reasonable interpretation \nof  the  statute,  it  would  be  constitutionally  impermissible  because  it  exceeds \nCongress’s Article I enumerated powers and transgresses on the reserved powers of \nthe States under the federal constitution’s structural principles of federalism and the \nTenth Amendment. U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1; id. amend. X. \n287.  The Rule requires Carroll ISD to apply gender-identity mandates as a \ncondition of receiving federal funding. Federal funding accounts for $2.15 million of \nCarroll ISD’s annual budget.  \n288.  Such a requirement is unconstitutionally coercive. The Rule requires \nCarroll ISD to adopt a controversial gender ideology or give up more than $2 million \nand disregard the Title IX systems put in place over five decades. That leaves Carroll \nISD with no meaningful choice. It is an improper use of the Spending Clause.  \n289.  Carroll ISD cannot accept the gender-identity mandates as applied to \ninterscholastic sports because that would conflict with Texas law, see Tex. Educ. Code \n§ 33.0834,  and  the  federal  government  cannot  commandeer  state  and  local \ngovernments in that way, see Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 584 U.S. 453, \n470–75 (2018).  \n290.  Requiring Texas schools to give up all federal funding—which is what \nthey would have to do to comply with Texas law—amounts to a “gun to the head.” \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 581 (2012) (plurality). Similarly, \nrequiring Texas to repeal its law protecting female sports or deprive its citizens of the \nbillions of dollars in education funding that their federal tax dollars underwrite, see \nid. at 676–81 (Scalia, J., concurring in relevant part), is “economic dragooning that \nleaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce,” id. at 582 (plurality).  \n291.  The Rule exceeds federal Spending Clause power. \n43 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 44 of 55   PageID 44\n \n292.  The Rule also violates Article I’s vesting of “[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted” to Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  \n293.  Congress  cannot  “abdicate  or  …  transfer  to  others  the  essential \nlegislative functions with which it is thus vested.” A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. \nUnited  States,  295  U.S.  495,  529  (1935).  When  authorizing  administrative \nregulations, Congress must at least provide “an intelligible principle” to ensure that \n“the agency exercises only executive power.” Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 461 (5th \nCir. 2022).  \n294.  If Congress delegated the authority to issue the Rule to ED (which it did \nnot), then that delegation violates Article I’s Vesting Clause. Congress would have \ngiven ED free reign to interpret “sex” in whatever way it chooses. Congress’s direction \nto target sex discrimination in education fails to give an intelligible principle because \nif “sex” can mean “gender identity,” Title IX becomes inconsistent with itself.  \n295.  As a result, the Rule is required to be held unlawful and set aside under \n5 U.S.C. § 706 and the Court’s inherent equitable power to enjoin ultra vires and \nunconstitutional actions. \n296.  The  Rule  must  also  be  enjoined  and  declared  unenforceable  under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 to preserve status and rights pending review of this Court. \nFOURTH COUNT \nRULE—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n(5 U.S.C. § 706; 28 U.S.C. § 2201) \n297.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint.  \n298.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n299.  Under the APA, a reviewing Court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency  action”  if  the  agency  action  is  “arbitrary,”  “capricious,”  or  “an  abuse  of \ndiscretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n44 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 45 of 55   PageID 45\n \n300.  Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if “the agency has relied on \nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle \nMf’rs Ass’n v. State Farm Auto Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n301.  The Rule fails to define the key terms, “sex,” “gender identity,” “sexual \norientation,” “sex stereotypes,” “sex characteristics,” “transgender,” and “sex assigned \nat birth.” \n302.  In drafting and promulgating the Rule, ED failed to undertake reasoned \ndecision-making in many respects.  \n303.  First, the Rule acts irrationally by using Bostock to justify its gender-\nidentity regime, even though the Bostock Court expressly disclaimed that its holding \napplied to other civil rights statutes that address sex discrimination (as Title IX does) \nor circumstances implicating private spaces or physical contact (as Title IX does). The \nagency’s explicit and pivotal reliance on Bostock represents a fundamental error at \nthe heart of the Rule and renders it arbitrary and capricious on its face.  \n304.  Second, the Rule’s gender-identity mandates are vague and impossible \nto apply. The Rule describes “gender identity” as “an individual’s sense of their \ngender.” This is undefinable and unworkable. Schools cannot know what it means or \napply it consistently. It has no basis in the statutory text. It rejects the explicit \nbiological binary of Title IX and therefore undermines the statute’s purposes.  \n305.  The Rule imposes inconsistent requirements. For example, the Rule \nrequires schools to let males who identify as girls into girls’ rest rooms and locker \nrooms even though limiting males from girls’ programs is not a gender identity \ndistinction. Yet ED and DOJ consider such distinctions a violation of the Rule.  \n45 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 46 of 55   PageID 46\n \n306.  34  C.F.R.  §§ 106.10  and  106.31(a)(2)  mandate  gender-identity \ndiscrimination despite purporting to prohibit it. For example, under the Rule schools \nmust let students use a locker room based on the sex with which they identify, \nmeaning that a male who “identifies” as a boy cannot use the girls’ locker room, but \na male who identifies as a female can. The Rule requires the school to treat the two \nmales differently based on gender identity, even as the Rule purports to prohibit \ndiscrimination based on gender identity. The Rule fails to consider this important \naspect of the problem. Such unexplained inconsistency is arbitrary and capricious. \n307.  ED’s inclusion of “sex stereotypes” as a version of sex discrimination is \nalso  unreasoned.  “[B]iological  differences  between  males  and  females”  are  “not \nstereotypes associated with either sex.” Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of Ala., 80 F.4th \n1205, 1229 (11th Cir. 2023); accord L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, \n484 (6th Cir. 2023). ED fails to explain why it considers biological differences to be \nsex stereotypes within the meaning of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 \n(1989) (plurality). That is a failure of reasoned decision-making. \n308.  Third, ED disregards the effect of its Rule on school policies that direct \nstaff not to tell parents when their children decide to identify as the opposite sex. \nRather  than  disavow  the  parental-exclusion  policies  in  the  two  example  school \npolicies that the NPRM cited with approval, see 87 Fed. Reg. 41,561, ED continues to \ncite the same examples in the Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. at 33,709. ED’s failure to address \nhow the Rule affects these parental-exclusion policies is a lack of reasoned decision-\nmaking.  \n309.  Fourth, the Rule does not consider the privacy interest in not exposing \none’s unclothed body to persons of the opposite sex. A student has a constitutionally \nprotected privacy interest in preventing persons of the opposite sex from seeing her \nunclothed or partially clothed body. See, e.g., Brannum, 516 F.3d at 495. This interest \nin bodily privacy, which is protected even in prisons, see, e.g., Fortner v. Thomas, 983 \n46 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 47 of 55   PageID 47\n \nF.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1993), applies to public-school students in housing as well \nas restroom, locker room, and shower facilities. By putting persons of the opposite sex \ninto these sex-specific spaces, the Rule creates a serious risk that students will be \nforced to expose their bodies to the opposite sex against their wishes. Children will \nreasonably hesitate to object lest the objection be taken as discriminatory harassment \nbased  on  gender  identity.  ED’s  failure  to  consider  these  privacy  interests  lacks \nreasoned decision-making.  \n310.  Fifth, the Rule does not explain ED’s reversal of its previous position \nthat “restroom, locker room, and shower facilities” are “living facilities” subject to \n20 U.S.C. § 1686.  \n311.  Sixth, ED failed to consider schools’ reasonable reliance interests when \npromulgating the Rule. For instance, the agency failed to consider the changes to \nlongstanding policies, practices, and facilities that schools would need to undertake \nto comply with the Rule while respecting the privacy rights and safety interests of \nothers. Schools adopted these policies and practices and built expensive facilities in \nreliance on ED’s prior positions. The failure to consider these reliance interests \nrenders the Rule arbitrary and capricious. \n312.  Seventh, ED had no reasonable justification to expand its definition of \nhostile-environment harassment beyond the 2020 regulations and Davis definition, \nincluding by expanding its scope to apply even off campus and to social media. Nor \ndid  ED  have  any  reasonable  justification  to  eliminate  the  actual  knowledge  or \ndeliberate indifference requirement pertaining to sex discrimination.   \n313.  Eighth, ED failed to consider any alternative policies, such as (1) taking \nno action; (2) creating rules to protect privacy and girls’ equal access to athletic \nprograms, under the correct understanding of Title IX; (3) grandfathering existing \ncategories of programs and practices covered by Title IX; or (4) creating or expanding \nexisting exemptions for those with safety concerns or other reliance on past policies. \n47 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 48 of 55   PageID 48\n \n314.  Ninth,  the  Rule  does  not  adequately  explain  how  it  proscribes \ndiscrimination against non-binary students or justify its inconsistent use of the de \nminimis harm standard to students who identify as transgender, as non-binary, and \nas consistent with their sex. The Rule’s preamble states that schools cannot exclude \na student from using bathrooms or locker rooms “consistent with that student’s \ngender identity” because that “imposes more than de minimis injury.” 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 33,818. The Rule’s preamble also says that discrimination based on sex, including \n“access [to] sex-separate facilities … applies with equal force to all students, including \n…  nonbinary  students.”  Id.  at  33,818;  see  also  id.  at  33,807.  But  the  Rule \nsimultaneously does “not specify how a recipient must provide access to sex separate \nfacilities for students who do not identify as male or female.” Id. at 33,818. These \ncontradictions and non-explanations show a failure of reasoned decision-making. \n315.  Thus, the Rule must be held unlawful and set aside under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. \n316.  The  Rule  must  also  be  enjoined  and  declared  unenforceable  under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 to preserve status and rights pending review of this Court. \nFIFTH COUNT \nINTERPRETATION AND FACT SHEET—CONTRARY TO LAW \n (5 U.S.C. § 706) \n317.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint. \n318.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n319.  Under the APA, a reviewing Court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” if the agency action is “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of \nstatutory  jurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right,”  or \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-\n(C).  \n48 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 49 of 55   PageID 49\n \n320.  An agency has no power to act unless Congress confers that power, and \nactions that are unauthorized by Congress are ultra vires.  \n321.  Title IX and its regulations do not prohibit discrimination on the basis \nof gender identity. \n322.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet’s mandates to the contrary exceed \nED’s authority under Title IX and related regulations. \n323.  Congress has not delegated to the executive branch any authority to \nimpose the mandates found in the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet.  \n324.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet’s reading of Title IX must satisfy \nthe clear-notice rule, a substantive canon of statutory interpretation that applies \nbecause  ED’s  construction  displaces  traditional  state  police  power  authority, \nimplicitly  abrogates  state  sovereign  immunity,  and  interprets  Spending  Clause \nlegislation. \n325.  The  Interpretation  and  the  Fact  Sheet  violate  the  major  questions \ndoctrine because Congress’s enactment of Title IX did not unambiguously give ED \nauthority to impose the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet since it vastly changes the \nrights and obligations in Title IX. \n326.  Because the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet exceed ED’s authority \nunder Title IX and its implementing regulations, the Interpretation and the Fact \nSheet are ultra vires, contrary to law, and issued in excess of ED’s authority.  \n327.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet go so far beyond any reasonable \nreading of the relevant congressional text and its implementing regulations that the \nInterpretation and the Fact Sheet functionally exercise lawmaking power reserved \nonly to Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  \n328.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet are contrary to law and exceed \nED’s statutory authority because Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII’s language is \ninapplicable to Title IX. \n49 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 50 of 55   PageID 50\n \n329.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet are contrary to law because, \nproperly interpreted, Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex” does \nnot encompass discrimination based on gender identity. \n330.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet’s rationale is contrived for the \nPresident’s policy convenience rather than based on law and necessary considerations \nunder the APA. See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019). \n331.  As a result, the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet must be held unlawful \nand set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706 and the Court’s inherent equitable power to enjoin \nultra vires and unconstitutional actions. \nSIXTH COUNT \nINTERPRETATION AND FACT SHEET—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n(5 U.S.C. § 706) \n332.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1–237 of this Complaint. \n333.  Each Defendant Department is an “agency” under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(b)(1). \n334.  Under the APA, a reviewing Court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency  action”  if  the  agency  action  is  “arbitrary,”  “capricious”  or  “an  abuse  of \ndiscretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n335.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet, and Defendants’ enforcement of \nthem, explicitly rely on an interpretation of Title IX and a reading of Bostock that is \nerroneous. \n336.  Without reliance on this legal interpretation, the Interpretation and the \nFact Sheet would not have been promulgated. \n337.  ED failed adequately to consider important aspects of the issue. \n338.  The Interpretation and the Fact Sheet create inconsistent and confusing \nstandards, cause absurd results, lead to discrimination, and undermine other sex-\nbased classifications.  \n50 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 51 of 55   PageID 51\n \n339.  In promulgating the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet, ED failed to \nconsider a gender-identity mandate’s effect on schools, staff, and students, including \ntheir constitutional rights, their interests in maintaining sex-specific facilities, and \ntheir interests in maintaining sex-specific athletic teams.  \n340.  In promulgating the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet, ED failed to \nconsider their impact on the interests of female athletes, including their privacy \ninterests and their interests in receiving an equal opportunity to participate in and \nbenefit from interscholastic athletics as part of their education.  \n341.  In promulgating the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet, ED failed to \nconsider  reliance  interests  of  schools  in  not  being  subject  to  a  prohibition  on \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity under Title IX.  \n342.  In promulgating the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet, ED failed to \nadequately acknowledge that the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet were a change in \nposition from its existing regulations and initial post-Bostock guidance. \n343.  ED failed to consider any alternative policies, such as (1) taking no \naction; (2) creating regulations to protect female sports and privacy under the correct \nunderstanding of Title IX; (3) grandfathering existing categories of programs and \npractices covered by Title IX; or (4) creating or expanding existing exemptions for \nthose with safety concerns or other reliance on past policies. \n344.  These failures render the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet arbitrary, \ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion. \n345.  The Interpretation’s and the Fact Sheet’s rationale is contrived for the \nPresident’s policy convenience rather than based on law and necessary considerations \nunder the APA. See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019). \n346.  As a result, the Interpretation and the Fact Sheet must be held unlawful \nand set aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n51 \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 1   Filed 05/21/24    Page 52 of 55   PageID 52\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff Carroll ISD respectfully prays for judgment in its favor and requests \nthe following relief: \nA.

In the Amarillo Case, \nDefendants challenged  standing to sue on behalf of school districts.11 Defendants do not \nchallenge standing in the present case. In fact, Defendants conceded at the July 8, 2024 hearing \nthat dismissal of the Amarillo Caseon jurisdictional grounds would undermine their claim splitting \nargument.12 For this reason, the Court determines that  should proceed at \nthis stage. Defendants may reassert their claim splitting argument, as appropriate, later in this \nlitigation.\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nUniv. of Texas v.

Carroll ISDis substantially likely to prevail on the merits.\nThemerits of the Final Rule and its underlying interpretationhave been addressedin some \nfashion by multiple courts, including this one.13 To date, three of the seven courts considering \nFinal Rule challenges concluded that the plaintiffs in those cases are likely to succeed on the \nmerits.14 And this Court, having already reached the merits stage with respect to the Guidance \n13 See  Educ., et al., 2024 WL 2978786, at *21 (granting preliminary \ninjunction to Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Idaho, and various school entities); Tennessee, et al. v. \nCardona, et al., 2024 WL 3019146, at *44 (granting preliminary injunction to Tennessee, Kentucky, \nOhio, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, and intervening organization);\nEduc., et al., 2024 WL 3273285, at *22 (granting preliminary injunction to Kansas, Alaska, Utah, \nWyoming, and various schools).\n14Louisiana, 2024 WL 2978786, at *2;Tennessee, 2024 WL 3019146, at *1;Kansas, 2024 WL 3273285,\nat *6.\n4\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 5 of 15   PageID 890\nDocuments, concluded that the pre-Final Rule agency action relied on an interpretation of Title \nIX that is contrary to law.15 The Court agrees with and fully incorporates here the analyses in \nthose decisions. Building on the reasoning of sister courts, the July 8, 2024 hearing confirmed \nthesoundness of those opinionsand the myriad ofways in which Carroll ISD is ultimately likely\nto succeed on the merits. Perhaps the most surprising moments from the hearing are those that \nrevealedtheshocking consequences and logical inconsistencies associated with the Final Rule.\nOral argument made clear that the Final Rule functionally displaces the statutory language \nwith Despite repeatedly stressing that no \nredefinition of sex exists in the Final Rule, in the same breath Defendants claim there is no \nmaterial way to distinguish between sex and gender identity.16 This suggests both concepts are \none in the same despite the representation that the Final Rule does not redefine sex away from \nbiological. Defendants failed to adequately e\ninherently objective and tethered to biology) is somehow consistent with the fluid notion of \ngender identity (inherently subjective and untethered from biology).\nIn an effort to comprehend the Final Rule, the Court posed a variety of hypothetical \nsituations to understand how agency action would work in practice for school districts like Carroll \nISD. Yet Defendants supplied almost no guidance whatsoever. Instead, Defendants evaded the \nhypotheticals . 17\n15Texas v.

Ignoring this major question,21 Defendants contend their preferential treatment of \ntransgender students compared to non-transgender students is nonetheless justified. Why?\nBecause denying the non-transgender student access or opportunities would not be on the basis \nthe action\n22 As Defendants see it [non-\ntransgender] 23 These statements make clear \nthat even if sex is not formally redefined, it is functionally redefined based on gender identity.\nEven worse, oral argument exposed the arbitrary nature of this functional change to the \nstatutory language. There are two ways this was made clear. First, Defendants repeatedly stated, \nwithout identifying, that the [l] derived\n18Id. at 74.\n19Id. at 79.\n20Id. at 78, 80.\n21Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *35 *40.\n22Draft Tr. of July 8, 2024 Hr at 82.\n23Id. at 81.\n6\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 7 of 15   PageID 892\n-and-comment  period.24 It seems  that  Defendants \nsummarily dismissed the concerns of non-transgender students.25Second, \nthat gender identity is subjective and can change over time lends itself to opportunistic uses of \ngender  identity.26 For  instance,  the  non-transgender student  who  is  denied  access  or  an \nopportunity need only temporarily identify as transgenderin order to obtain those benefits.Once \nthe benefit is obtained, the non-transgender student can switch back to their gender-conforming \nidentity. For the Final Rule to allow students to switch their gender identity on and off based on \nsubjective preferences without a cognizable justification is not just arbitrary it is circular.\n27 So long as a student identifies with the \nopposite gender, that student is imbued with extra opportunities and protections. But that same \nstudent would be denied those extra identical opportunities and protections without claiming a \nnonconforming gender identity. This cannot be.\nDefendants arguments also prove too much. Perhaps unintended, efforts to eliminate \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity ironically seem to function as impermissible sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX. The Court already explained that sex discrimination is the inferior \ntreatment on the basis of sex rather than benign differentiation.28\nthe Final Rule to hypothetical situationsreveals that inferior treatment of non-transgender students\n24Id. at 79.\n25Id. at 78 79.\n26 This admission at the hearing\nmay or may not \n27\n28 Texas disfavors, denies, \nexcludes, or otherwise treats one biological sex worse than the other. But Title IX does not prohibit \ndifferential treatment that allows for sex-separation or sex-specific benefits, provided that one biological \nsex is not treated as inf\n7\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 8 of 15   PageID 893\nis permissible. Defendants attempted to excuse their form of differential treatment as permissible \nto the non- transgender student.29 This acks \nsupport particularly given that stigmatization harms are, as Defendants suggest, inherently \nsubjective30 and Defendants never explain why there is no harm. As this Court has already \nexplained, sex differentiation is permissible only when (1) there is no invidious reason and (2) \nwhen comparable opportunities generally exist.31 But it is unclear how there is comparative harm \nwhen the transgender student is allowed to use a preferred bathroom while the non- transgender\nstudent is robbed of that same benefit. It is difficult to see how affording extra privileges to the \ntransgenderstudentbased onsubjective feelings of discomfort while simultaneously excluding the \nnon- transgender student for similarly subjective feelings is something other than invidious \ndiscrimination. Simply put, the non-transgender kid is being treated as inferior and has access to \nfewer spaces and opportunities. The statutory text does not allow for this.\nMaking  matters  worse,  by\nproviding different rules based on whether a student professes a conforming or nonconforming \nthe same as sex, this logic would create additional access and opportunities for transgender\nstudents. Such favoritism  unfairly allocates benefits and burdens. J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel T.B.,\n511 U.S. 127, 131 (1994) even conflicts with its anti-\n29DraftTr. of July 8, 2024 Hr at 23, 78, 79.\n30Id.at 55.Defendants inability and resistance to applying the Final Rule to various situations that schools \nmay experience reveals the lack of clarity in the Final Rule. If the architects and defenders of the Final \nRule cannot provide insight, how will individual schools navigate this morass? Given the stakes that flow \nfrom messing up, this uncertainty islikewiseproblematic under the Spending Clause. \n31 Texas Recognition of innate biological differences is permissible\nencouraged, even under Title I\n8\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 9 of 15   PageID 894\ndiscrimination mandate. Either both biological sexes receive equal access and opportunities or \nneither one does. Injecting gender identity into the mix upsets this balance. \nOne  explanation  for  this  distortion  of  Title  IX\ninconsistent reliance on the statutory exemptions. On the one hand, Defendants contend that the \nonly permissible forms of sex differentiation, notwithstanding whether some harm results, are \nfound in the statutory exemptions.32 But, on the other hand, Defendants supply a standard for \nidentifying when differentiation is permissible: de minimis harm.33 If Defendants wish to strictly \nadhere to these exemptions, it follows that these exemptions constitute the complete universe of \npermissible sex differentiation. Under this construction, everything outside of these specific \nexemptions would be impermissible sex differentiation.34 Not only does such a construction \nunder Title IX, but it is also\ninconsistently applied. Strict adherence to the statutory exemptions also reveals that there is zero \nneed for the de minimis harm standard Defendants articulate. Either the categories are strictly \nadhered to or inform what else would qualify as permissible sex differentiation. The de minimis\nharm standard only aligns with the latter. \nWhen pressed about the empirical evidence that supports prioritizing psychological harm \nto transgender students (stigmatization due to lack of access to preferred spaces, etc.) over harm \nto non-transgender students (privacy or safety concerns created by inclusion of transgender\nstudents), Defendants were unable to identify any authority that supports this notion.35 In fact, \nDefendants could not identify (1) how the Final Rule accounted for the harms to non-transgender\n32Draft Tr. of July 8, 2024 Hr at 90 91.\n33Id. at89 93.\n34Id. \n35Id. at 57, 64, 70, 71.\n9\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 10 of 15   PageID 895\nstudents (namely, young biological girls who want to avoid exposing their unclothed bodies to \nbiological boys who identify as transgender) and (2) described concerns for non-transgender\nthis characterization.36 nt of the population. At \nno more than roughly 1% to 2% of the population, it is difficult to see how transgender students\nare not also 37\nDefendants decided to prioritize harms subjectively felt by transgender students without \nidentifying a sufficient rationale in the Final Rule for doing so at the expense of non-transgender\nstudents. And Defendants  fail  to address  the countervailing  concern  that  encouraging  and \nnormalizing nonconforming gender identity may actually cause harm rather than prevent it.38\nWithout justification, Defendants would permit recipients of federal funds to separate biological \nsexesfor all the reasons listed in 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a)(1) (9) and § 1986. Beyond these categories,\nsex separation under the Final Rule is allowed only if it satisfies an additional requirement found \nnowhere  in  Title  IX:  accommodate  for  those  with  dysphoric  notions of  gender.  34  C.F.R. \n§§ 106.31(a)(2), 106.33, 106.34. Not only would this requirement render the statutory carve-outs \nmeaningless, as this Court explained elsewhere, but it lacks any support in the statutory text.39\nTreating non-transgender students differently than transgender students reveals that, \nunder the Final Rule, gender identity is the more salient consideration (over biological sex) for \ndifferentiating permissible from impermissible sex separation. In other words, where gender \n36Id. at 70 71.\n37New estimates show 300,000 youth ages 13-17 identify as transgender in the US, UCLA (June 10, 2022) \nhttps://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/transgender-estimate-press-release/.\n38 may encourage the student \nto pursue gender transition or other gender-affirming care that a student may later regret.\n39 See Texas, 2024 WL 2947022, at *33 ( Department s expanded interpretation injects notions of \nself-professed and potentially ever-\n). \n10\n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 43   Filed 07/11/24    Page 11 of 15   PageID 896\nidentity and biological sex are pitted against one another, oral argument revealed that gender \nidentity will always win out under the Final Rule unless there is a statutory exemption disallowing \nthis new preferential treatment.40 Privileging gender identity over biological sex is in no way \nauthorized by the statutory text. And the consequences based on this statutory distortion appear \nlimitless. For these reasons, and those stated by other federal courts, Carroll ISD is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their challenge to the Final Rule.\nB. Carroll ISD will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief.\nNot only is the Final Rule likely unlawful, it also risks irreparable harm to Carroll ISD.\nThis risk of harm  Daniels \nHealth Scis., L.L.C. v.

In that opinion, the Court granted a preliminary injunction to Carroll ISD, but deferred ruling \non the simultaneous request for a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705 \npending further briefing.1 Recognizing that technical differences exist between the equitable \nremedy of an injunction and the statutory remedy of a stay, the Court ordered cross-supplemental \nbriefing on four issues: \n1.  Whether a stay, like a vacatur, is the default remedy at the preliminary stage of an APA \nchallenge to agency action; \n \n2.  Whether a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 exclusively contemplates a universal scope or \ncould also allows for party-specific relief; \n \n3.

Whether non-party limitations on the scope of a 5 U.S.C. § 705 stay, such as only \nstaying certain provisions, is appropriate in this case.2 \n \n1 July 11, 2024 Mem. Op. & Order 14, ECF No. 43. \n2 Id. at 15. \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 55   Filed 07/31/24    Page 2 of 6   PageID 1281\nThe parties disagreed on these points during the July 8, 2024 hearing and expanded on this \ndisagreement in the supplemental briefs.3  \nHaving reviewed the supplemental briefing submitted by the parties and amici, along with \nconsidering the record at this stage, the Court concludes that Carroll ISD is not entitled to a stay \nof the Final Rule’s effective date at this time. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Carroll ISD’s \nrequest for a stay because complete relief has already been awarded through a preliminary \ninjunction based on the existing record. However, should circumstances change prior to a final \nruling on the merits, Carroll ISD may renew its request for a stay and/or seek a broadened \npreliminary injunction. \nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder the APA, a “reviewing court” may “postpone the effective date of an agency action \n. . . to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. \nPreliminary relief under section 705 is “not party-restricted and allows a court to ‘set aside’ \nunlawful agency action.” Career Colls. & Schs. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 255 \n(5th Cir. 2024). By “postpon[ing] the effective date of an agency action,” a section 705 stay stops \nthe portions of the rule which are deemed unlawful. Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. § 705). Additionally, a \nsection 705 stay does not need to be issued concurrently with agency action. All. for Hippocratic \nMed. v. FDA, 78 F.4th 210, 255–56 (5th Cir. 2023), rev’d on other grounds, 602 U.S. 367 (2024). \n“Motions to stay agency action pursuant to [section 705] are reviewed under the same \nstandards used to evaluate requests for interim injunctive relief.” Affinity Healthcare Servs. v. \nSebelius, 720 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 n.4 (D.D.C. 2010); see also Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 (5th \nCir. 2016) (applying preliminary injunction factors). This requires the movant to show (1) a \n \n3 See generally Defs.’ Suppl. Br., ECF No. 48; Pl.’s Suppl.

Daniels Health Servs., L.L.C. v. Vascular Health \nScis., L.L.C., 710 F.3d 579, 582 (5th Cir. 2013). The last two factors merge when the government \nis the opposing party. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). As the movant, it is the party \nseeking relief who bears the burden of proving the four elements of the requested injunctive relief. \nNichols v. Alcatel USA, Inc., 532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir. 2008). Importantly, when determining \nthe appropriate remedy, relief “should be crafted to provide ‘complete relief’” and nothing more. \nMock v. Garland, F.4th 563, 587 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n702 (1979)).  \nII.  ANALYSIS \nThe Court stands on its prior analysis with respect to the likelihood of success on the \nmerits, balance of the equities, and public interest factors.4 The arguments and evidence presented \nin the supplemental briefs do not alter the Court’s determination that Carroll ISD carried its \nburden as to these factors. For this reason, the Court’s prior analysis is fully incorporated in this \nanalysis. However, with the benefit of additional briefing, the Court now concludes that Carroll \nISD has not carried its burden at this stage regarding the irreparable harm factor to justify \nadditional relief in the form of a stay.5 \nCarroll ISD argues that it “remains exposed to further irreparable injury in two forms” \nwithout a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date.6 First, Carroll ISD claims that private parties are \n \n4 See July 11, 2024 Mem. Op & Order 4–14, ECF No. 43. \n5 To be clear, the Court fully stands on its determination that Carroll ISD sufficiently demonstrated \nirreparable harm within the school district to justify a preliminary injunction limited in scope. \n6 Pl.’s Suppl. Br. 6, ECF No. 49.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 55   Filed 07/31/24    Page 4 of 6   PageID 1283\nnot enjoined and may sue to enforce the likely unlawful provisions.7 Second, Carroll ISD \ncontends that students and employees who travel out of Texas risk various harms in states that \nimpose a similar transgender mandate.8 No doubt, these occurrences would cause serious harms \nif they occurred. But Carroll ISD has not shown how such future harms are either possible to \nremedy or sufficiently imminent.  \nStart with out-of-state travel. Carroll ISD has not demonstrated how staying the Final Rule \nwould somehow provide protection to students and employees who travel to a state not presently \ncovered by an injunction. That is because a stay of the Final Rule results in no effect on state \npolicies prioritizing accommodations for transgender students at the expense of non-transgender \nstudents. As unfortunate as this reality is, a stay would not dissolve those state policies. Carroll \nISD acknowledges that “[a] stay here would prevent the federal government from requiring \nrecipients in California and Oregon to apply its unlawful [Final] Rule.”9 And even though the \nCourt agrees that state laws similar to the Final Rule very likely “‘function as impermissible sex \ndiscrimination under Title IX,’”10 those laws are not before this Court. As a result, the Court \ncannot provide relief to Carroll ISD students and employees traveling to such states by entering \na stay of the Final Rule. Thus, a preliminary injunction presently provides the most complete \nrelief possible. \nTurning next to future lawsuits by private parties, Carroll ISD has not shown that these \nlegal actions are sufficiently imminent. See Humana, Inc. v. Avram A. Jacobson, M.D., P.A., 804 \nF.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986) (emphasizing that irreparable harm exists if “the injury is \nimminent” and “money damages would not fully repair the harm”). Concrete evidence must be \n \n7 Id. \n8 Id. \n9 Id. at 8 (emphasis added). \n10 Id. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 55   Filed 07/31/24    Page 5 of 6   PageID 1284\nprovided to demonstrate the requisite injury. Rest. L. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., 66 F.4th 593, \n599–600 (5th Cir. 2023); see also VanDerStok v. BlackHawk Mfg. Grp. Inc., 659 F. Supp. 3d \n736, 742 (N.D. Tex. 2023) (O’Connor, J.) (“Irreparable harm must be concrete, nonspeculative, \nand more than merely de minimis.”). Carroll ISD does not provide concrete evidence here and \ncites to one example of a private lawsuit in Virginia three years ago.11 This alone is too \nspeculative to sufficiently show the irreparable harm of private lawsuits. See Janvey v. Alguire, \n647 F.3d 585, 600 (5th Cir. 2011) (noting that a showing of “speculative injury is not sufficient” \nto satisfy irreparable harm element (alteration and citation omitted)). Thus, this ground does not \njustify a stay of the Final Rule’s effective. But should private lawsuits become sufficiently \nimminent, Carroll ISD may reassert its request for relief at that point. \nBased on the record before the Court and not on speculative harm that might later occur \n(even if undeniably invidious), Carroll ISD has failed to show that complete relief beyond the \npreliminary injunction is possible. Nor has Carroll ISD carried its burden on irreparable harm at \nthis stage to justify a stay. Therefore, a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date is not appropriate \nand the preliminary injunction provides the most complete relief currently possible. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nHaving now considered the deferred question of whether Carroll ISD is also entitled to a \nstay of the Final Rule’s effective date, the Court concludes that the current record does not \npresently demonstrate a need for a stay of the Final Rule’s effective date in light of the preliminary \ninjunction  already  granted.  Accordingly,  the  Court  DENIES  this  request.  However,  should \ncircumstances change to show that imminent harm will result absent a broadened preliminary \ninjunction or a retroactive stay of the Final Rule’s effective date, Carroll ISD may renew its request \n \n11 Id. at 7. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:24-cv-00461-O   Document 55   Filed 07/31/24    Page 6 of 6   PageID 1285\nfor such relief pending final resolution of this case.  \nDespite this ruling, the Court nonetheless recognizes that Carroll ISD is substantially \nlikely—indeed,  substantially  certain—to  succeed  on  the  merits.  For  this  reason,  the  Court \nORDERS that this case will be adjudicated on an expedited schedule in the interests of justice. \nSee  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  1  (identifying  the  duty  to  “secure  the  just,  speedy,  and  inexpensive \ndetermination of every action and proceeding”). Accordingly, the parties SHALL submit a joint \nschedule for expedited resolution of this matter by no later than August 7, 2024. \nSO ORDERED on this 31st day of July, 2024. \n \n \n_____________________________________\nReed O’Connor\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n6 \n ",
