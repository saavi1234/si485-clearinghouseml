COMPLAINT \n \nROY COOPER in his official capacity as the \n \nGovernor of North Carolina, NORTH \nCAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \nAND HUMAN SERVICES, KODY \nKINSLEY in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the North Carolina Department \nof Health and Human Services, SUSAN \nOSBORN in her official capacity as Assistant \nSecretary for County Operations of the \nDivision of Social Services, MARK PAYNE \nas the Director of the Division of Health \nService Regulation, MECKLENBURG \nCOUNTY, MECKLENBURG COUNTY \nDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES-\nYOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES, \nGASTON COUNTY, and GASTON \nCOUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL \nSERVICES, \nDefendants. \n \n \n1 In accordance with Rule 5.2(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the first names of the Plaintiff children and \nany other minors mentioned by name in this Complaint are pseudonyms.  The first letters of the pseudonyms and the \nlast name initials are the same as their real names. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1 \nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 1 of 71\n\n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  North Carolina’s foster care system has been operating in a state of crisis for years. \nThe foster care population is increasing while foster home capacity decreases. Children are placed \ninto institutions at twice the national average, are shuttled between placements with disturbing \nfrequency, and do not receive adequate services or necessary medical treatment or education. \nCaseworkers are not receiving adequate training or support, they cannot manage the crushing \ncaseloads, morale is low, and turnover is outpacing recruitment. State leadership predicted, \ncorrectly, that this crisis would invite “a massive class action lawsuit.” \n2.  When the State takes a child into custody, it becomes responsible for the child’s \nsafety and wellbeing. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) \nand the 100 county departments of social services (“County DSS”) share responsibility for North \nCarolina’s foster children, and they share responsibility for the State’s continuous and systematic \nfailure to protect and provide for North Carolina’s foster children. For over a decade, DHHS has \nignored numerous warnings that its failure to lead and supervise county departments of social \nservices (“county DSS” or “DSS”) threatens the safety and wellbeing of foster children, and its \nongoing failure to supervise and support county DSS places foster children across the state at \nsubstantial risk of harm. And County Defendants—Mecklenburg County, Mecklenburg County \nDepartment of Social Services-Youth and Family Services (Mecklenburg DSS-YFS), Gaston \nCounty, Gaston Country Department of Social Services (Gaston DSS)—have failed to provide \ntimely and appropriate treatment, to place children in safe and appropriate foster homes, to \nthoroughly investigate allegations of maltreatment in care, and to recruit necessary and appropriate \nfoster homes. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  2\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 2 of 71\n\n \n3.   The Defendants’ ongoing failures place foster children at significant risk of serious \nharm in violation of their rights under federal law and the U.S. Constitution. \n4.  According to Kody Kinsley, the Secretary of DHHS, “[i]n any given week, dozens \nof children in foster care are living in emergency departments and child welfare offices. And \namong the children who struggle to find an appropriate placement that have been referred to the \ndepartment for additional help and coordination, a quarter of these children have been moved fifty \ntimes or more.” DHHS’s placement deficit is compounded by its services deficit. More than 60% \nof counties “have zero children or adolescent psychiatrist[s].” \n5.  DHHS has confirmed these observations: “[e]ach week, dozens of children with \ncomplex  behavioral  health  needs  require  immediate  protection  in  a  safe  and  supportive \nenvironment that can meet their physical and mental health care needs. The number of children \nwith these needs far exceeds the spaces and services available to keep them safe, help them \novercome crisis and reunite them with family and community. As a result, they can be found \nsleeping in hospital emergency rooms, in county departments of social services offices or local \nhotel  rooms.  ‘Living’  in  these  inappropriate  settings  compounds  the  trauma  that  children \nexperience during separation from their families and natural support systems. The longer children \nare separated from their families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and they run a \nhigher  risk  of  experiencing  poor  health  and  social  outcomes,  including  homelessness  and \ninvolvement with the justice system.” \n6.  Secretary  Kinsley  has  also  highlighted  North  Carolina’s  crisis-level  staffing \nproblems. DHHS’s 28% vacancy rate “has doubled since COVID,” 25% of counties have turnover \nrates exceeding 40%, “and high turnover is linked to longer stays in foster care.” The 2020-2024 \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  3\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 3 of 71\n\n \nChild and Family Services Plan noted that “Child welfare staff feel overwhelmed, unable to \ncomplete the work they are assigned, and struggling to manage a work-life balance.” \n7.  The named plaintiffs—Jameson C. (Gaston County); Megan S. and Chloe S. \n(Johnston County); Annie W. (Mecklenburg County); Justin B. (Mecklenburg County); Morgan \nG. (Mecklenburg County); Sara M., Leah M., and Harry M. (Alleghany County)—are children in \nfoster care in North Carolina. They bring this lawsuit as a civil rights action on behalf of all \nchildren who are now, or will be, in the custody of county departments of social services “under \nthe supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services.” G.S. § 108A-1. They seek both \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the state agency, state officials, and named counties \nresponsible for violating their rights under the United States Constitution and federal law, which \npromise vulnerable children in state custody the right to be free from physical and psychological \nharm, and impose an affirmative obligation on the state to protect foster children against such \nharm. \n8.  Additionally, plaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against County \nDefendants—Mecklenburg County, Mecklenburg DSS-YFS, Gaston County, Gaston DSS—for \nmaintaining policies, practices, and customs that violate plaintiffs’ rights under both federal and \nstate law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a), and \n42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and \ninjunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  In addition, the court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim based on \nNorth Carolina law pursuant to 28 U.S.C 1367(a). \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  4\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 4 of 71\n\n \n10.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, and \nDefendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District.  \nPARTIES \nI.  Named Plaintiffs \n \nJameson C. \n \n11.  Jameson C. is an 8-year-old boy from Gaston County. He has been in foster care \nfor half his life. Jameson appears in this action through his next friend, Steven Bolch. Steven Bolch \nis employed as a pharmacy technician and previously worked at a clinic for behavioral health \nservices.  Steven  fostered  Jameson  for  18  months.  Steven  has  acquainted  himself  with  the \nallegations in the Complaint regarding Jameson’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his \nbest interests. \n12.  In May 2019, shortly after his 4th birthday, DSS removed Jameson from his home \nand placed him into foster care because his parents sexually, physically, and emotionally abused \nhim. \n13.  In the two years following his removal, from May 2019 to June 2021, DSS placed \nJameson in five different foster homes all over the state. He lived in Cherokee County, Lincoln \nCounty,  Mecklenburg  County,  and  Gaston  County,  and  moved  between  several  different \ncatchment areas including Vayo, Partners, and Cardinal. \n14.  After DSS removed Jameson from his family’s home, Jameson was diagnosed with \nPTSD due to severe sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, as well as ODD, and ADHD. In the \ntwo years following his removal, Jameson never received mental health treatment or specialized \ntherapy. Indeed, consistent treatment was impossible given the frequency and distance of his \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  5\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 5 of 71\n\n \nplacement changes. Instead, Jameson was placed on a medication regime that included at least \neight different medications, including psychotropic medications. \n15.  In June 2021, Jameson arrived at his 5th placement. The foster parent, a pharmacy \ntechnician  and  behavioral  health  specialist,  immediately  began  the  process  of  reducing \npolypharmacy and securing specialized mental health treatment. The foster parent petitioned DSS \nto reduce the medication regimen and successfully discontinued the use of psychotropic drugs. To \naddress the untreated PTSD, the foster parent secured mental health therapy services for Jameson. \nAnd to address the untreated sexual trauma, the foster parent entered Jameson into a specialized \nsexually problematic behavioral therapy program through Duke University. DSS did not assist in \nobtaining any of these services.  \n16.  Jameson’s  medical  treatment  was  inconsistent  because  his  parents  refused  to \nprovide consent for treatment or could not be reached to obtain consent, and DSS did not make \nreasonable efforts to obtain consent or otherwise ensure that Jameson received necessary medical \ntreatment. When COVID vaccines were approved for children, the parents refused to consent to \nvaccination. When DSS was unable to contact the parents to obtain consent to administer a \ndifferent brand of ADHD medication, Jameson went without his medication. \n17.  During his first six months in this placement, Jameson was required to visit his \nparents, alternating between weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly visits. After each visit, Jameson \nengaged in problematic sexualized behaviors. The foster parent tracked these behaviors and shared \nthe information with Jameson’s caseworker, but the visitations continued. \n18.  During a hearing in December 2021, Jameson’s parents requested that monthly \nvisits be changed to weekly visits. DSS knew that Jameson’s sexually problematic behaviors were \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  6\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 6 of 71\n\n \ntriggered when he visited his parents, his sexual abusers, but despite this knowledge, DSS \nrecommended bi-weekly visitation. \n19.  After nearly 32 months in foster care, long past the federal requirement, DSS still \nhad not filed to terminate Jameson’s parents’ parental rights. The foster parents expressed an \ninterest in adopting Jameson, but DSS said that it had no plans to file for a termination of parental \nrights. DSS explained that it would not file TPR for Jameson because DSS policy prohibited TPR \nfor only one sibling, and Jameson’s older brother was not in an adoptive placement and did not at \nthat time have any prospects of an adoptive placement.  DSS, however, did not point to any specific \npolicy that prevented a younger sibling from being adopted where their older sibling was not in an \nadoptive home.  \n20.  In the months following the hearing, Jameson had bi-weekly visits with his parents, \nand Jameson’s sexual behaviors worsened. He perpetrated sexual acts on children at daycare and \nat school, on the foster parents’ young nephews, and against animals. \n21.  Jameson’s case was not well managed as Jameson’s caseworker was managing \napproximately 20 cases and even more individual children, and was attempting to manage these \ncases without a reliable case management system. Coming from South Carolina child welfare \nservices, where she utilized an electronic case management system, the caseworker relayed that \nshe was surprised and distressed that DSS was operating under a paper-based system. Case files \nwere stashed in cabinet drawers: with files for 18 children stuffed into one drawer; Jameson’s case, \nlengthier and more complicated, occupied another drawer. The caseworker was unable to keep up \nwith all the paperwork and documentation in DSS’s archaic system. \n22.  The foster parents had learned to manage Jameson’s behaviors and implement \nsafety plans to prevent problematic sexual behaviors. But the specialized treatment behavior \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  7\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 7 of 71\n\n \nmanagement was only so effective after the two years of untreated trauma. Around June 2022, \nJameson’s sexualized behavior was directed to the foster parents, and they felt that it was no longer \nin Jameson’s best interests to remain in their home. \n23.  The foster parents requested that DSS remove Jameson and provided 30 days \nnotice. DSS couldn’t find a placement for Jameson, so the foster parents agreed to extend the \nplacement. It took approximately 120 days for DSS to find a new placement for Jameson. \n24.  Around October 2022, DSS placed Jameson with an experienced foster parent in \nCharlotte, NC. The new foster parent called the former foster parents multiple times per week \nseeking advice on how to manage Jameson’s worsening behaviors. Jameson’s caseworker often \ncalled the former foster parents seeking information about Jameson’s medication regimen. Unable \nto control his behaviors, Jameson was again placed on psychotropic drugs, including Risperidone. \nJameson was 7 years old.  \n25.  As a result of Jameson’s new placement, Jameson lost his relationship with his \ntherapist with whom he had finally developed a trusting relationship. The loss of this important \nrelationship further contributed to Jameson’s instability. \n26.  Jameson has changed placements several times since then and is now in his eighth \nplacement. After four years in state custody, DSS still has not filed to terminate parental rights and \nJameson’s permanency plan continues to remain uncertain. \n27.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Jameson has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Jameson’s \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  8\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 8 of 71\n\n \ncase, and not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nJameson’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Without relief, Jameson’s condition \nwill continue to suffer from placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed \npermanency. \nMegan S. and Chloe S. \n28.  Megan, seven years old, and her sister Chloe, five years old, are from Johnston \nCounty. Megan and Chloe appear in this action through their next friend, Daria Barazandeh. Daria \nBarazandeh began fostering children in North Carolina in 2012. Having spent over a decade as a \nfoster parent, adoptive parent, and foster parent advocate, Daria is familiar with North Carolina’s \nfoster care system. Daria has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nMegan and Chloe’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to their best interests. \n29.  Megan and Chloe were taken into custody on or about September 2019 based on \nallegations of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Megan was three and Chloe was less than \na year old. \n30.  Megan has been diagnosed with various disabilities, including ADHD, autism, \nreactive  attachment  disorder,  and  oppositional  defiant  disorder.  She  has  been  on  several \nprescription medications, including Zoloft, Prozac, Adderall, Abilify, Focalin, and Catapres. Both \nchildren show signs of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and/or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, including \nsensory sensitivities, but DSS has not yet had them diagnosed. Additionally, the girls suffer from \nother physical conditions attributable to prenatal exposure to toxins. \n31.  DSS first placed the children with a family friend. But because DSS did not provide \nthe appropriate supports, the placement disrupted after one month. \n32.  DSS then placed the children with Ms. O., a foster parent. During this time, DSS \nfailed to secure therapy for the children. Ms. O had to secure services on her own. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  9\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 9 of 71\n\n \n33.  Ms. O was willing to be a guardian for Megan and Chloe, and the girls’ parents \nagreed to this. DSS had been working on a plan to terminate the parental rights of Megan and \nChloe’s parents so that Ms. O. could adopt them. But suddenly, after two years in the home of Ms. \nO, DSS removed the children without explanation, and without another adoptive home. DSS \nthreatened to deny Ms. O and the children an opportunity to say goodbye if Ms. O objected to the \nremoval. DSS gave the girls a few minutes to pack and say goodbye.  \n34.  After DSS removed Megan and Chloe from Ms. O’s home, DSS cycled the girls \nbetween seven different foster homes. Due to the untreated trauma and high frequency placements, \nMegan’s mental health deteriorated and her behavioral issues worsened, often manifesting in angry \noutbursts. Without adequate support from DSS, the placements disrupted. Megan struggled to bond \nwith the various foster parents. \n35.  Finally, a foster parent asked DSS to remove Megan and leave Chloe. DSS agreed \nto separate the girls. Megan’s behavior worsened when she heard the news. DSS placed Megan in \na residential treatment facility in and around August 2023. DSS did not tell Megan’s parents where \nshe was placed even though the case plan goal is still reunification and DSS has not moved to \nterminate parental rights.  \n36.  Although Megan was required under North Carolina law to be enrolled in school, \nDSS had not done so. Because the residential treatment facility in which she was placed did not \nhave educational programing, Megan was sent to the Johnston DSS office during the day. \n37.  On or about October 4, 2023, Johnston DSS, struggling with staffing vacancies, left \nMegan unsupervised in a DSS office in the same room with a 17-year-old boy, and the boy sexually \nassaulted Megan. DSS sent Megan to the emergency room for evaluation and immediately placed \nher back in the residential treatment facility. The perpetrator has since been charged with first \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  10\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 10 of 71\n\n \ndegree statutory assault. Upon information and belief, Megan has not received any specialized \ntreatment or therapeutic support to cope with the assault. \n38.  Megan has since been removed from residential treatment and placed in a foster \nhome. She remains separated from her sister, Chloe. \n39.  Although the girls have been in custody for over two years, DSS still has not filed \na petition to terminate parental rights. Because DSS has not made any significant steps towards \neither reunification or adoption for the children, the girls are  unlikely to reunite or obtain \npermanency in the near future. \n40.  The court ordered monthly visitations with the parents, but the girls’ caseworker \nhas denied the parents visitation since at least October 2023. Upon information and belief, DSS \nhas not moved to modify the court order; the caseworker has simply refused to comply with it. \n41.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Megan and Chloe have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. If Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged \nin reasonable case planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable \ninformation  system,  not  acted  in  disregard  of  reasonable  professional  standards  as  to  the \nmanagement of Megan and Chloe’s case, and not acted with deliberate indifference to their legal \nrights, Defendants may have prevented Megan and Chloe’s condition from deteriorating while in \nstate custody. Without relief, Megan and Chloe will continue to suffer from placement instability, \nlack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nAnnie W. \n \n42.  Annie is a thirteen-year-old girl from Mecklenburg County. She has been in foster \ncare since she was five years old. Annie appears in this action through her next friend, Veronika \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  11\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 11 of 71\n\n \nS. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender based in Charlotte, NC. Having spent \nnearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is familiar with North Carolina’s foster \ncare system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nAnnie’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to her best interests. \n43.  Mecklenburg DSS took Annie into custody in 2015 based on a finding of neglect.  \nAlthough her parents’ parental rights were terminated in 2018, DSS has not placed her in an \nadoptive home before or since that time. \n44.  Annie has severe developmental delays and acute mental health issues. She has an \nextensive history of mental health treatment and has been hospitalized numerous times since she \nwas taken into DSS custody. She has also been diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. She is on \nthree different  psychotropic  medications,  including  one  to  treat  her  ADHD  and  two  mood \nstabilizers. \n45.  Despite her developmental delays, Annie was not evaluated and did not receive \nearly intervention services. She has been enrolled in special education programs since 2017. \n46.  Since DSS took Annie into custody, DSS has placed her in at least 22 foster \nplacements, including three different PRTFs. Because these placements were ill-prepared to \nsupport Annie’s mental health needs, the placements quickly disrupted, and Annie’s condition \nrapidly deteriorated. Annie cycled in and out of hospitals, where she stayed for months at a time \nbecause DSS could find no other placement. In July 2019, DSS removed Annie from a hospital \nsetting and placed her in an emergency placement with a new family. Annie went back to the \nhospital after only one day in her new placement. In September 2020, after yet another placement \ndisrupted, Annie was again admitted to a hospital where she remained for five months. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  12\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 12 of 71\n\n \n47.  DSS placed Annie in Levine Children’s Hospital in October 2023. Annie remained \nthere for six months. Because Levine Children’s Hospital is not a mental health treatment facility, \nAnnie did not receive the mental health treatment necessary to ameliorate her risk of further \ndeterioration and instituionalization. Nor did Annie receive appropriate eduational services while \nplaced in Levine Children’s Hospital, including including special education programs needed to \naddress Annie’s severe developmental delays. \n48.  Following her extended stay at Levine Children’s Hospital, Annie was transferred \nto a non-institutional placement and enrolled in school. \n49.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Annie has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Annie’s case, \nand not acted with deliberate indifference to her legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nAnnie’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Annie remains at risk of deterioration \ndue to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nJustin B. \n50.  Justin is a 16-year-old boy from Mecklenburg County. Justin appears in this action \nthrough his next friend, Veronika S. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender based \nin Charlotte, NC. Having spent nearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is familiar \nwith North Carolina’s foster care system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the allegations in \nthe Complaint regarding Justin’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his best interests. \n51.  Mecklenburg DSS took Justin into custody in 2011 due to domestic abuse. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  13\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 13 of 71\n\n \n52.  DSS initially placed Justin with his maternal grandmother. DSS knew that Justin’s \nmother had been removed from Justin’s grandmother based on allegations of abuse. Justin \nremained in his grandmother’s home from 2011 to 2016. During that time, Justin was sexually \nabused. \n53.  In 2016, DSS removed Justin and his siblings from his grandmother. \n54.  Justin suffers from PTSD as a result of the sexual abuse. And his condition \nworsened because his did not receive timely and appropriate treatment for his trauma. \n55.  Since 2016, DSS has placed Justin in over 18 placements, including a psychiatric \nresidential treatment facility (Alexander Youth Network, Greensboro) and a group home (Miracle \nHouses) where Justin (then 13 years old) resided with older youth. DSS also placed Justin in a \nseries of emergency placements, emergency therapeutic-like placements, and therapeutic foster \nhomes. Justin lived with a sibling in only one of these placements.  \n56.  DSS also placed Justin in many rapid response homes, including homes operated \nby Unique Caring Foundation (“UCF”). Mecklenburg DSS contracts with UCF to provide short-\nterm (30 day) foster home placements. These placements are considered equivalent to therapeutic \nfoster homes, but, unlike therapeutic foster homes, UCF is paid by DSS under contract rather than \nthrough Medicaid. Justin was placed in a rapid response home for more than a year. He did not \nreceive therapeutic services or education services. During this time, his mental and emotional \nhealth deteriorated, and his educational growth was stunted. \n57.  Because of the high frequency of placement changes, Justin was transferred to over \n10 different schools. \n58.  At least 5 different case workers have been assigned to Justin’s case. Caseworker \nturnover caused poor communication and case planning on Justin’s case.  \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  14\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 14 of 71\n\n \n59.  In 2023, DSS found an adoptive home for Justin. Initially, the prospective adoptive \nparents felt prepared to adopt Justin based on the information that DSS provided to them. But after \nlearning about Justin’s full history, the adoptive parents believed that they could not adequately \ncare for Justin and ended the adoption process. Justin was aware that the adoptive parents had \nrejected him. This caused even more trauma.  \n60.  Upon information and belief, Mecklenburg DSS routinely withholds information \nabout children from adoptive parents to persuade those parents to adopt foster children. But when \nthose parents learn about the child’s extensive needs (either before or after adoption), the adoption \ndisrupts. Mecklenburg DSS’s practice of withholding information from adoptive parents results in \ndisruptions that compound the child’s trauma and reduce the likelihood of future adoptions and \nplacements. \n61.  After the adoption process disrupted, DSS suddenly terminated Justin’s long-time \ntherapist, who specialized in trauma and sexual abuse, and with whom Justin had developed a \ntrusting relationship. \n62.  After his mental health treatment was disrupted, Justin struggled in an emergency \nplacement. At one point, staff at the provider day program called police and a mobile crisis unit. \nJustin was calm by the time they arrived, but he was transported to a hospital emergency room. \n63.  Justin  spent  Christmas  in  the  hospital  because  DSS  was  unable  to  locate  a \nplacement for Justin. Justin’s hospitalization was not medically necessary. While hospitalized, \nJustin was not receiving treatment for his mental health, was not attending school, and was not \nmoving towards permanency. \n64.  DSS failed to monitor Justin while he was in the hospital. At one point, DSS did \nnot know what hospital Justin was in. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  15\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 15 of 71\n\n \n65.  Mecklenburg DSS routinely transports foster children to local hospitals with the \nexpectation that those children will remain at the hospital on a “social hold” until an appropriate \nplacement can  be found. While in the hospital, these children do not receive their regular \ntreatments and do not receive educational services. \n66.  Justin was discharged from the hospital on January 18, 2024 and placed in an \nemergency residential treatment program. Upon information and belief, there was no clinical \nrecommendation or certificate of need for Justin’s placement at a residential treatment facility. \nAlthough placement in these emergency residential treatment programs are not intended to exceed \n120 days, Justin has been there for seven months. He is still there. \n67.  Justin’s mother faces mental health challenges, but DSS failed to secure appropriate \nservices for Justin’s mother. Because DSS did not attempt efforts at reunification, Justin’s parents’ \nparental rights were terminated. Although Justin has a permanency plan of adoption, DSS has not \nplaced him in an adoptive home and is not actively seeking an adoptive home. \n68.  After nearly a decade in custody with no prospect of permanency, Justin’s mother \nhas expressed a renewed interest in the case, and the judge has reconsidered the possibility of \nreunification. \n69.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Justin has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Justin’s case, \nand not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  16\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 16 of 71\n\n \nJustin’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Justin remains at risk of deterioration \ndue to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nMorgan G. \n \n70.  Morgan is a 15-year-old boy from Mecklenburg County. Morgan appears in this \naction through his next friend, Veronika S. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender \nbased in Charlotte, NC. Having spent nearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is \nfamiliar with North Carolina’s foster care system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the \nallegations in the Complaint regarding Morgan’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his \nbest interests. \n71.  Mecklenburg DSS removed Morgan and his siblings from their biological parents \nin 2014 due to repeated physical abuse and domestic violence. Morgan also exhibits signs of a \nhistory of sexual abuse. \n72.  Morgan  has  been  diagnosed  with  intellectual  disability,  attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, \noppositional  defiant  disorder,  and  other  unspecified  trauma  and  stressor-related  disorders. \nAlthough his care coordinators have suspected that he is on the autism spectrum, Morgan has never \nbeen tested for autism. \n73.  Morgan’s experience in DSS custody has been marked by extreme instability. DSS \nhas changed his placement at least 30 times. These repeated placement changes have caused \nsignificant disruption to his education and social services. The placement changes have also led to \na severe deterioration in his mental and emotional state, exacerbating underlying emotional and \nbehavioral issues, and creating a vicious cycle of crisis, disruption, and further instability.    \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  17\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 17 of 71\n\n \n74.  Within his first year in DSS custody, from April 2014 to May 2015, Morgan \nexperienced 11 placement changes alone. \n75.  DSS placed Morgan in a therapeutic foster home in May 2015 and he remained \nthere until March 2019. The placement disrupted due to Morgan’s behavioral issues and DSS’s \nfailure to provide sufficient services to Morgan or support to his foster parents. DSS failed to make \nreasonable attempts to place Morgan in a home where he could live for substantial period of time.  \n76.  DSS placed Morgan in 18 placement changes between March 2019 and February \n2020, with many placements lasting no more than a few days. \n77.  These constant placement changes caused Morgan to change elementary schools \napproximately six different times. Given his significant intellectual disability and other mental and \nemotional deficits, the lack of consistency in his education has further destabilized Morgan. Even \nworse, Morgan has gone years without any educational instruction at all.  \n78.   From August 2019 to February 2020, Morgan was not enrolled in school.  Prior to \nAugust 2019, Morgan was enrolled in a school in Mecklenburg County. After his placement \ndisrupted in August 2019, he was sent to another placement in Gaston County and referred to a \nday treatment facility there. DSS failed to reenroll Morgan in a school in Gaston County. \n79.  The day treatment facility did not have an Individualized Education Program \n(“IEP”) for Morgan. Morgan did not have an IEP because he was not enrolled in any school. While \nsome children in day treatment received instructional materials from their schools, Morgan was \ngiven crossword puzzles. When he was not doing crossword puzzles, he would sleep or go the \ngym. \n80.  Morgan also faced physical and emotional abuse in the foster home where DSS \nplaced him in August 2019. Specifically, Morgan’s then-foster parent would send him to day \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  18\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 18 of 71\n\n \ntreatment in a diaper even though he was 12 years old. Morgan had been wearing a diaper at night \nfor anuresis and to prevent him from digging into his rectum (a possible indication of sexual trauma \nthat no one has ever fully explored). Morgan’s foster parent would not pack any additional diapers \nfor Morgan at the facility, and stated that Morgan needed to sit in his soiled diaper to teach him a \nlesson because he “knew better.” \n81.  Morgan also complained that this foster parent subjected him to various forms of \npunishment, including hitting him and making him sit in the corner by himself. Although DSS \nremoved Morgan after he reported the abuse, this maltreatment further traumatized Morgan.    \n82.  At the time, DSS did not have any available appropriate placements for Morgan in \nNorth Carolina. So in February 2020, DSS sent Morgan to an out-of-state PRTF in South Carolina. \nMorgan’s social worker recommended against sending Morgan to a PRTF because he did not meet \nthe criteria for psychiatric residential treatment. \n83.  DSS did not provide the out-of-state PRTF with a copy of Morgan’s IEP and, thus, \ndid not implement it. During this period, DSS also did not provide the PRTF with a comprehensive \nsummary of Morgan’s mental health needs or of his educational history. \n84.  Morgan remained at the PRTF until April 2022. Morgan remained at the PRTF \nbecause DSS could not find a placement for him in North Carolina, not because there was a clinical \nrecommendation for placement in a PRTF. \n85.  In or around April 2022, Morgan was transferred to a new placement in North \nCarolina – an alternative family living home (“AFL”) or a home licensed to provide services to \nchildren with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Although this was a better placement \nsetting for Morgan than the out-of-state PRTF, his educational needs continued to be neglected. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  19\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 19 of 71\n\n \n86.  Upon his return, Morgan was enrolled in an alternative school setting for children \nwho had been suspended or expelled from the regular school system due to behavioral issues. The \nenvironment was not conducive to supporting children with intellectual disabilities like Morgan, \nand DSS failed to provide Morgan with any support to aid this transition back to school. Morgan \nhad spent many years without any formal education and was provided with no additional support \nto prepare him to return to school. Unsurprisingly, the transition to a more traditional educational \nenvironment was a failure and he only attended for a short time before he experienced another \ncrisis.  \n87.  Within weeks of his placement transfer, Morgan had an emotional outburst and got \ninto an altercation with his new foster parent. Morgan’s behavioral outburst escalated when he hurt \nhis foster parent’s dog and threatened to hurt her. As a result, he was transported to the Emergency \nRoom at Davis Regional Medical Center in Statesville. The hospital was not a psychiatric facility, \nnor did it have a children’s unit. It was wholly unequipped to address Morgan’s needs. \n88.  On multiple occasions, the hospital determined that it was no longer medically \nnecessary for Morgan to remain in the hospital. Hospital staff contacted DSS, but DSS refused to \npick up Morgan because DSS had no other placement for him. Morgan languished in the hospital \nfor weeks, without adequate care or support, and without any effort to continue his educational \ninstruction. \n89.  Due to the lack of adequate care and support, Morgan’s behavior continued to \nescalate, leading him to be involuntarily committed and prolonging his hospital admission.  \n90.  The hospital was not a safe placement for Morgan. Morgan is prone to running \naway when he is emotionally disturbed. But because the hospital is not a locked facility and does \nnot  specialize  in  children  with  behavioral  disorders.  Withough  locked  doors  or  continuous \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  20\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 20 of 71\n\n \nsupervision, Morgan ran away from the hospital multiple times, sometimes several times in a \nsingle day. \n91.  Morgan’s flights from the hospital brought him into grave danger. On one occasion, \nhe ran barefoot across an interstate highway, risking collision with oncoming traffic, and suffering \nabrasions all over his feet. \n92.  On another occasion, he ran away and jumped into a stranger’s car. The stranger \neventually returned Morgan to the hospital. \n93.  Morgan’s lack of adequate supervision or care at the hospital and his frequent \nabscondments led to numerous run-ins with law enforcement. The hospital regularly called the \npolice because of Morgan’s outbursts and the police often used force to restrain him. On one \noccasion, several officers immobilized Morgan in the middle of the street by sitting on his body.  \n94.  Morgan’s condition deteriorated so significantly in the hospital that members of \nhis care team perceived that if he remained in the hospital any longer, he was at risk of serious \nharm or even death. After nearly two-weeks in the hospital, an intervention led by hospital \nadministrators caused DSS to remove Morgan from the hospital and place him in another AFL.  \n95.  Morgan remained in the AFL for approximately one year. Due to his foster \nparent’s personal circumstances, Morgan was moved to another AFL in the summer of 2023. \nDue to years of educational neglect, Morgan is well below grade level. Years of instability and \nemotional neglect, as well as his recent traumatic hospital admission, have also taken their toll, \nand he continues to be at risk of a placement disruption due to his unmet behavioral and \nemotional needs. Morgan is only a few years away of aging out of the foster care system and \nDSS has no made plans for him to obtain permanency.  \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  21\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 21 of 71\n\n \n96.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Morgan has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Morgan’s \ncase, and not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nMorgan’s  condition  from  deteriorating  while  in  state  custody.  Morgan  remains  at  risk  of \ndeterioration due to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nSara M., Leah M., and Harry M. \n97.  Sara, Leah, and Harry are siblings from Alleghany County. They appear in this \naction through next friend, Kari Danforth. Kari adopted one child from out of state and fostered \nten children in North Carolina. She was selected as “Foster Parent of the Year” by Children’s \nHome Society. Kari is very familiar with North Carolina’s foster care system. She has acquainted \nherself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding Sara, Leah, and Harry’s experiences in \nfoster care and is dedicated to their best interests. \n98.  DSS took the siblings into custody in February 2022 due to their parents’ substance \nabuse and domestic abuse problems. Sara was seven years old, Leah was six, and Harry was three. \n99.  The siblings were placed in Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home.  \n100.  Upon information and belief, DSS did not make reasonable efforts to contact \nrelatives or other kin with whom the children could be placed before sending them to the group \nhome. DSS ignored prior communications with the children’s maternal grandmother, Mrs. B., who \npreviously had notified DSS that she would be able to take the children in the event that a removal \noccurred. No one from DSS contacted Mrs. B after the removal. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  22\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 22 of 71\n\n \n101.  Mrs. B contacted DSS immediately after learning of the children’s removal. She \nrequested to speak to and visit the children. She stated that she and her husband had been in \nfrequent contact with the children up until February and it was important for the children to know \nthat “Grampa and Nana are still available.” DSS responded, “We typically do not approve visits \nor telephone calls with grandparents.” \n102.  Mrs.  B  made  several  inquires:  why  DSS  was  denying  contact  with  her \ngrandchildren, why the children were placed at Ebenezer and whether they were receiving any \nspecific counseling or care there, why she was not immediately contacted upon removal. She \nreceived no response to these inquiries. After a month of repeated attempts, she was granted \ncontact with her grandchildren. \n103.  At a permanency hearing, the court ruled that the three children could reside with \ntheir grandparents. But DSS kept the children at Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home until they \ncompleted the school year. \n104.  When Mrs. B picked up the children from the group home, DSS was not present to \ndiscuss the children’s permanency status, their experience at the group home, or their current \nmental and emotional state. She was informed that the children would be held back a year \nacademically.  \n105.  The children lived with Mrs. B and her husband until May 2023. They began the \nprocess of becoming licensed as a kinship placement. The children’s permanency plan was \nchanged from reunification to guardianship. The children’s biological parents refused to sign \nguardianship forms, and did not undergo required drug testing or domestic violence assessments. \nInstead, they appealed the children’s removal. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  23\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 23 of 71\n\n \n106.  Under the guardianship plan, DSS required the grandparents to supervise visitations \nwith the children’s biological parents. After every visitation, the children were emotionally \ndisturbed and experienced repercussive behavioral issues. Mrs. B witnessed how these visitations \nwere  traumatizing  to  the  children  and  requested  that  DSS  cease  them.  DSS  refused.  The \ngrandparents declined to become guardians. \n107.  Shortly before the grandparents completed the foster care licensing process, DSS \nsuddently removed the children from their grandparents and placed them with their aunt and uncle. \n108.  The children lived with their aunt and uncle for five months. During that time, the \naunt and uncle also observed how distraught the children were following visitations with their \nbiological parents. They expressed an interest in adopting the children so that they could give them \na permanent home and terminate the visitations that caused them so much distress. DSS declined \nto pursue adoption. The caseworkers told them that the guardianship paperwork was already \nproceessed and that adoption would take too long. DSS did not indicate that guardianship was in \nthe best interest of the children. \n109.  At a court hearing, DSS informed the court that the parties had agreed that the \npermanency plan for the children was guardianship with the aunt and uncle. The possibility of \nadoption was not mentioned at all, nor were the concerns regarding parental visitations. The court \napproved the guardianship plan with the aunt and uncle. The court was never apprised of their \ndesire to adopt the children, nor of the issues with continuing contact with their biological parents, \n110.  After several months caring for the three siblings in addition to their three biological \nchildren, the aunt and uncle determined that they could no longer financially support Sara, Leah, \nand Harry without assistance. The aunt and uncle expressed that they were still willing to adopt \nthe children, but DSS said that adoption was no longer an option because the court approved \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  24\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 24 of 71\n\n \nguardianship. DSS also said that it lacked authority to pursue adoption as an alternative to \nguardianship. \n111.  In October 2023, DSS abruptly terminated the children’s placement with the aunt \nand uncle and moved them to the home of their paternal grandmother. \n112.  The  children  began  experiencing  problems  in  their  new  placement  almost \nimmediately. Whereas they previously lived in a stable, loving, and supportive environment, they \nwere exposed to violence and instability in their paternal grandmother’s home. The children’s half-\nbrother already resided in the home. He was troubled and prone to violence, and he bullied Sara. \nThe children’s father also had a history of domestic violence. Although there was a restraining \norder in place prohibiting contact with the children, their grandmother nevertheless allowed her \nson to visit the home due to his relationship with their half-brother. This further destabilized the \nchildren. \n113.  During conversations with the aunt and uncle, Sara complained of being bullied by \nher half-brother. She also stated that she did not want to live there and wanted to run away. \n114.  The children were permitted to visit Mrs. B during Christmas 2023. They were \nhappy to be reunited with their maternal grandparents and aunt and uncle. But their mental and \nemotional state had clearly deteriorated since they went to live with their paternal grandmother. \nWhen their visit was coming to an end, Sara threatened to run away or hurt herself if she was \nforced to return to her paternal grandmother’s home.  \n115.  In January 2024, DSS removed the children from their paternal grandmother’s \nhome and returned them to Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home. The children did not have any of \ntheir clothes or belongings from before being placed at the group home. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  25\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 25 of 71\n\n \n116.  The children have remained in the group home ever since. DSS has not facilitated \ncontact with the maternal grandparents or aunt and uncle other than a court-ordered monthly 15-\nminute phone call. DSS said that they didn’t want the children to become more attached to the \nmaternal grandparents. \n117.  The maternal grandparents have expressed their desire to adopt the three children. \nThey have repeatedly asked for the children to come back to live with them in the interim while \nDSS works towards a permanency plan. DSS has refused these requests. DSS has kept these three \nchildren, all under the age of 10, in a congregate care facility despite the immediate availability of \na safe, stable, and loving kinship placement with their maternal grandparents. DSS has restricted \nthe children’s contact with their relatives despite the nurturing and supportive role that their \nmaternal grandparents and aunt and uncle have in their lives. \n118.  At a recent permanency hearing, when asked why the children were in a group \nhome rather than in kinship placements, DSS responded that the kids are happy at Ebenezer \nChristian Children’s Home, and that the children are “saved” and want to be baptized. The \nchildren’s parents do not support the apparent religious indoctrination the children are enduring at \nEbenezer Christian Children’s Home. \n119.  DSS has not plans to change placement. The next permanency hearing is scheduled \nfor January 2025. \n120.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Sara, Leah, and Harry have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. If Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged \nin reasonable case planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable \ninformation  system,  not  acted  in  disregard  of  reasonable  professional  standards  as  to  the \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  26\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 26 of 71\n\n \nmanagement  of  their  case,  and  not  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  their  legal  rights, \nDefendants may have prevented Sara, Leah, and Harry from deteriorating while in state custody. \nWithout relief, Sara, Leah, and Harry will be at ongoing risk of placement instability, lack of \nappropriate services, delayed permanency, and religious indoctrination contrary to their parents’ \nwishes. \nII.  Defendants \n121.  Defendant Governor Roy Cooper is the Governor of North Carolina and is sued \nsolely in his official capacity.

This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  28\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 28 of 71\n\n \n129.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass:  \n130.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 11,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DSS under \nthe supervision of DHHS and/or with whom DHHS has a special relationship. \na.  A class comprised of all children for whom North Carolina DHHS has or will have \nlegal  responsibility  and/or  a  special  relationship  in  the  context  of  the  child \nprotection system (the “General Class”). \nb.  A subclass comprised of all members of the General Class who have or will have \nemotional, psychological, cognitive, or physical disabilities (the “ADA Subclass”). \nNumerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n131.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 11,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DHHS \nand/or with whom DHHS has a special relationship. \n132.  The ADA Subclass consists of thousands of children with disabilities who are or \nwill become a ward of DHHS. \nTypicality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n133.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the General Class and the \nADA Subclass Class, as their claims arise from the same policies, practices, or courses of conduct; \nand their claims are based on the same theory of law as the subclass’s claims. \n134.  The questions of fact and law raised by named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n135.  Questions of fact common to the General Class include:  \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  29\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 29 of 71\n\n \na.  whether state Defendants fail to maintain a case management system capable of \nadequately protecting foster children; \nb.  whether state Defendants fail to adequately supervise county DSS; \nc.  whether state and county Defendants fail to recruit and retain sufficient number and \ndiversity of foster care homes; \nd.  whether state and county Defendants fail to maintain a system that protects foster \nchildren from physical, psychological, and emotional harm; \ne.  whether state and county Defendants fail to maintain a system that provides \npermanency to foster children within a reasonable period of time; \n136.  Questions of fact common to the ADA Subclass include:  \na.  whether state Defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiffs within the ADA \nSubclass by supervising the State’s foster care system in a manner that denies \nqualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State’s services, programs, or \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, and by failing to \nreasonably modify the State’s foster care system to avoid discrimination against \nchildren with disabilities. \n137.  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the Class and subclass , \nas their claims arise from the same policies, practices, or courses of conduct; and their claims are \nbased on the same theory of law as the class’s claims. \n138.  Questions of law common to the General Class include: \na.  whether state Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997; \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  30\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 30 of 71\n\n \nb.  whether state Defendants’ systemic failures, including its deliberate decision to not \nestablish mandatory performance metrics, violate the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment; \nc.  whether state Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ right to a permanent \nhome and family, as well as their right to be free from harm and have their basic \nneeds  met  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution.  \nd.  Whether county defendants violate state law by failing to comply with caseload \nstandards for caseworkers, in accordance with 10A NCAC 70G.0501 \n139.  Questions of law common to the ADA Subclass include: \na.  whether state Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective implementing \nregulations; by unnecessarily placing youth with disabilities, or placing them at risk \nthereof,  in  institutional  settings  and  denying  them  access  to  meaningful, \nindividualized, and appropriate community-based treatment and supports. \nAdequacy: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n140.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes \nthat they seek to represent. Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable \nto all members of the classes, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. Counsel \nfor Plaintiffs know of no conflict among the class members. The named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff \nChildren are represented by counsel experienced in class action litigation, child welfare litigation, \nand complex litigation. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  31\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 31 of 71\n\n \na.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, David Baloche, Laura Welikson, and Robyn Goldberg, \nattorneys with A Better Childhood, Inc., a non-profit legal organization, which has \nextensive experience and expertise in federal child welfare class action litigation \nactions throughout the U.S.; \nb.  Christopher J. Blake and D. Martin Warf, attorneys with Nelson Mullins, which has \nextensive experience and expertise in federal class actions throughout the U.S. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A) and (B) \n141.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) \nbecause the number of General Class members is approximately 11,000, and the prosecution of \nseparate actions by individuals would create a risk of inconsistent and varying adjudications, which \nin turn would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants. Additionally, the \nprosecution of separate actions by individual members could result in adjudications with respect \nto individual members that, as a practical matter, would substantially impair the ability of other \nmembers to protect their interests. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n142.  This action is also maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \nbecause  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  actions,  and  omissions  that  form  the  basis  of  this \ncomplaint are common to and apply generally to all members of the Classes, and the injunctive \nand declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply to all members of the class. \nSTRUCTURE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM \n143.  North Carolina is a state-supervised, county-administered child welfare system. \nThe state agency—North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”)—and \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  32\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 32 of 71\n\n \nthe 100 county departments of social services (“county DSS”) share responsibility for the safety \nand wellbeing of children in foster care. \nI.  DHHS \n144.  DHHS is “the sole state agency responsible for administering or supervising the \nadministration of the Child Welfare Services Program in North Carolina.” DHHS is responsible \nfor supervising all 100 county DSS. G.S. § 108A-1, -71, -74. DHHS must enter into written \nagreements with county DSS specifying “mandated performance requirements and administrative \nresponsibilities”; if a county DSS fails to comply with the written agreement or mandated \nperformance requirements, DHHS must implement a corrective action plan, and if the county DSS \nfails to comply with the corrective action plan, DHHS must “temporarily assume all or part of the \ndepartment’s social services administration” and “develop and implement a corrective plan of \naction.” G.S. § 108A-74(a2), (a3), (c), (j). Alternatively, DHHS must assume control of social \nservices administration when DHHS  determines that a county DSS “is not providing child \nprotective, foster care, or adoption services in accordance with State law…or fails to demonstrate \nreasonable efforts to do so, and the failure to provide the services poses a substantial threat to the \nsafety and welfare of children in the county.” G.S. § 108A-74(h). \n145.  DHHS is responsible for developing statewide training programs for County DSS \n(G.S. § 108A-71, -74). \n146.  Foster parent licensing, recruitment, and retention processes are shared between the \nstate and counties. DHHS is responsible for: “[e]stablishing state licensure standards and state \npolicy for how counties will work with foster and adoptive parents; [e]stablishing statewide board \nrates and participating ‘50-50’ with the counties in paying the non-federal share of the rates; \n[r]eviewing  applications  for  licensure  submitted  by  county  or  private  provider  agencies; \n[c]ollecting and maintaining data on licensed foster homes and licensing actions; and [d]eveloping \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  33\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 33 of 71\n\n \na statewide diligent recruitment and retention (DRR) plan and working with each county to \ndevelop county DRR plans.” NC APSR 2023 at 66; G.S. § 131D-10.3, 10.6. \n147.  DHHS, county DSS, and  Local Management Entity/Managed Care Organizations \n(LME/MCOs) share responsibility for providing health services to children in foster care. LMEs \n“are responsible for the management and oversight of the public system of mental health, \ndevelopmental disabilities, and substance abuse services at the community level,” and must “plan, \ndevelop, implement, and monitor services within a specified geographic area.” G.S. § 122C-115.4. \nDHHS is responsible “for the coordination of public services between area authorities, county \nprograms,  and  State  facilities,”  and  for  ensuring  that  LME/MCOs  are  properly  managing \nbehavioral health services. G.S. § 122C-111, 124.2. When a county DSS “wishes to disengage \nfrom a local management entity/managed care organization,” DHHS must, among other things, \nensure that the “[p]rovision of services is not disrupted by the disengagement.” G.S. § 122C-\n115(a3)(1). DHHS must implement a corrective action plan or assume direct control of operations \nwhen minimally adequate services are not being provided by LME/MCOs. G.S. § 122C-124.1. \nDHHS is also responsible for determining how appropriated funds will be allocated throughout \nthe state. G.S. § 122C-147.1.  \nII.  COUNTY DSS \n148.  County DSS have statutory duties and responsibilities to “administer the programs \nof public assistance and social services”; “appoint necessary personnel”; “assess reports of child \nabuse and neglect and to take appropriate action to protect such children”; “accept children for \nplacement in foster homes and to supervise placements for so long as such children require foster \nhome care.” G.S. § 108A-14. Binding regulations promulgated by DHHS define the duties and \nresponsibilities of county DSS regarding personnel and caseload standards (10A NCAC 70G \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  34\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 34 of 71\n\n \n.0501), out-of-home placement  procedures (10A NCAC 70G .0503),  and case management \nservices (10A NCAC 70G .0504). County DSS must also enter into agreements with LME/MCOs \nto provide health services to children in foster care. G.S. § 122C-115, -115.2.   \n149.  State law requires that “Social Workers or Case Managers serving children in \nfamily foster homes shall serve no more than 15 children.  Social Workers or Case Managers \nserving children in therapeutic foster homes shall serve no more than 12 children.”  (10A NCAC \n70G.0501) \n150.  County  DSS  are  responsible  for  “recruiting,  training,  and  supporting  foster \nparents,” as well as “recommend[ing] the licensure of foster homes to [DHHS].” 10A NCAC 70G \n.0402(11). County DSS “complete licensure applications that are submitted to NC DSS for review \nand approval”; and “[p]rovide ongoing training and support to foster parents who are licensed.” \nCounty DSS are also responsible “for providing case management to children placed in foster \nhomes and for conducting regular visits with children and foster parents in the homes.” \nWIDESPREAD SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN NORTH CAROLINA’S CHILD WELFARE \nSYSTEM CONTINUE TO HARM ITS FOSTER CHILDREN \nI.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Fuel North Carolina’s Placement Crisis \n151.  Child welfare policy requires that children in foster care reside in family-like \nenvironments, in or close to their home communities, and with kin caregivers and siblings \nwhenever possible. Stable and appropriate placement for children in foster care is essential for \nchild safety and wellbeing, and maintenance of family bonds. Without appropriate and supported \nfoster homes, or appropriate specialized treatment programs, agencies must cycle children through \nhomes, institutions, group placements, and other temporary and emergency placements with \ndisturbing frequency. Additionally, the lack of foster homes creates an overreliance on placements \nthat are unsafe and inappropriate for children, including congregate care settings. . \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  35\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 35 of 71\n\n \n152.  Placement instability produces a cascade of intersecting and compounding harms, \nincluding: (i) a disruption of a child’s sense of security and attachment to their caregivers; (ii) a \nreenactment of the trauma of removal; (iii) a reduced likelihood of reunification and exiting from \ncare and an increased likelihood of returning to care after reunification; (iv) a disruption in a child’s \neducation; (v) a loss of the opportunity to establish long-term relationships with adults; (vii) an \nincreased risk of abuse and neglect; (viii) a risk of developmental delays or setbacks because of \ndisrupted attachment and inconsistent caregiving; (ix) a greater likelihood of running away from \ntheir placements; (x) a disruption of a child’s therapeutic relationship with their mental health care \nprovider and gaps in treatment; (xi) an exacerbation of mental health symptoms; (xii) delays in \nreceiving  a  diagnosis  or  accessing  treatment  for  mental  health  conditions;  (xiii)  difficultly \nestablishing  coping  mechanisms  and  adaptive  behaviors  to  manage  stress  and  emotional \nchallenges; and (xiv) increases in rates of juvenile delinquency and institutionalization. \n153.  North Carolina has failed to license, recruit, and retain a sufficient number of \nappropriate foster homes, and to provide necessary supports to those homes, which causes children \nto be housed in unsafe and inappropriate settings. DHHS acknowledges that the number of children \nwith complex behavioral needs “far exceeds the space and services available to keep them safe, \nhelp them overcome crisis and reunite them with family and community,” and that the lack of \nappropriate placements forces the agency to house children in hospital emergency rooms, DSS \noffices, or hotel rooms. “‘Living’ in these inappropriate settings compounds the trauma that \nchildren experience during separation from their families and natural support systems. The longer \nchildren are separated from their families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and \nthey run a higher risk of experiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness \nand involvement with the justice system.” \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  36\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 36 of 71\n\n \n154.  North Carolina’s placement crisis has been echoed by numerous DHHS and DSS \nsenior managers and employees. In September of 2022, when DHHS Assistant Secretary for \nCounty Operations, Susan Osborne, told county directors of social services departments that the \nsystem was in “crisis” and that “there could be a massive class action lawsuit,” she was referring \nto housing children in DSS offices or holding children with emotional and behavioral health needs \nin emergency rooms beyond discharge because there was nowhere else to place them. Similarly in \nMarch 2022, a NC Health News article discussed that foster children “have been even further \ntraumatized  in  North  Carolina  recently  by  having  to  sleep  in  the  offices  of  social  service \ndepartments, in hospital emergency rooms or local hotels as child welfare workers search for a \nsafe bed and temporary housing.”   \n155.  The Director of Wake County’s Division of Child Welfare, Paige Rosemond, has \nbeen quoted as saying: “We have definitely experienced an increase in not having a placement \nand, in turn, having children at our building awaiting placement . . . Up to two children at a time \nstay at the Wake County Human Services building on a blow-up mattress or a recliner waiting to \nfind a transition home.” Rosemond added: “That’s what keeps me up at night because I know that \nthese kids’ needs are not being met while at our building. Staffers call hundreds of foster facilities \nacross the country for placement, but there simply aren’t enough. We have facilities that are just \ntelling us no we can’t serve that youth.” Children “need the stability. They yearn for it, they’re \nhungry for it . . . If they can get into a home where they feel cared for and safe and like there’s no \nthreat that they’re going to have to go anywhere again, they bloom . . . I struggle with the fact that \nwe may be, as an individual system and the systems across the state that are serving this shared \npopulation, that we are failing these children.” Wake County Child Welfare Co-Interim Director, \nSheila Donaldson, confirmed that “[t]urning part of an office building into a makeshift shelter for \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  37\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 37 of 71\n\n \ndays or even weeks is now a common last resort. On any given night, as many as nine children \nhave slept in the Wake County Social Services Office because of the shortages.” \n156.  The executive director of a housing service has called the situation “really dire.” \nShe explained that “[t]here are not enough places for kids” and that in meetings with DSS \nleadership, DSS has relayed that there are “kids sleeping in the conference room and that they were \nhaving to partner with other organizations for things like showers and meals[.]” The reporter was \nunable to get answers from the county DSS about why kids are sleeping in buildings, and “[w]hen \npressed,” a DSS spokesperson would only say that “DSS has nothing further to add and appreciates \nyour efforts to assist in recruiting foster care placements.” \n157.  North Carolina has known about its placement problems for many years, at least \nsince 2015 when the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) found that North Carolina’s \nsystem of foster and adoptive parent licensing, recruitment, and retention was “not in substantial \nconformity” with national standards. Among other things, the CFSR noted delays in receiving \nbackground check results from DHHS, uncertainty surrounding counties’ access to background \ncheck information, and the lack of a statewide process to ensure that counties are consistently \naddressing negative criminal background findings. Additionally, North Carolina “does not have a \nuniform system in place across the state that monitors or provides consistent standards for diligent \nrecruitment,” and “recruitment efforts vary by county and are not coordinated at the state level.” \n158.  North Carolina’s capacity crisis has ballooned over the past decade. In 2012, there \nwere 6,920 non-relative foster homes in North Carolina; in 2022, there were only 5,183. In 2018, \nthere were 6,306 total licensed foster homes; in 2022, only 5,436. Meanwhile, the number of foster \nchildren increased from approximately 8,400 in 2012 to 10,200 in 2022. As foster home capacity \ndecreases and the foster care population increases, North Carolina’s foster children find themselves \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  38\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 38 of 71\n\n \nin jails, emergency rooms, DSS offices, homeless shelters, hotels, and other inappropriate and \nunsafe settings. \n159.  The Queen City News reported in March 2023 that as North Carolina has suffered \na 20% decrease in foster families over the last four years, “foster children have begun to endure \nmore challenging situations, including ‘living’ out of cots in jails, DSS offices, and emergency \nrooms because there are not enough foster families in the state to accommodate them.” According \nto the reporting, one hospital group confirmed that more than a dozen children with complex \nbehavioral health needs were living in emergency rooms in one area in North Carolina, and seven \nother children were similarly situated in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. \n160.  North Carolina’s foster home deficit is contributing to an increased reliance on \ncongregate care. As DHHS recently observed, “data on the use of congregate care suggests North \nCarolina lacks an adequate supply of family foster homes in at least some counties and regions…. \nAccording to their social workers, the most common reason was the lack of an available family \nfoster home.” In 2021, North Carolina ranked among the 10 worst states for placing foster children \nin group homes. The percentage of North Carolina foster children living in congregate care (13%) \nis nearly double the national average (7%). \n161.  The lack of appropriate foster homes in North Carolina has led to a dramatic \nincrease in placement instability. As Secretary Kinsley acknowledged, “among the children who \nstruggle to find an appropriate placement that have been referred to the department for additional \nhelp and coordination, a quarter of these children have been moved fifty times or more.” Between \n2017 to 2021, for children in care less than 12 months, the percentage of children with three or \nmore placements increased 10% (from 9% to 19.4%); for children 12-24 months in care, 19% \n(from 22.8% to 41.7%); for children 24+ months in care, 15% (from 55% to 70.2%). Nearly 1 in \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  39\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 39 of 71\n\n \n4 foster children in North Carolina have changed placements four or more times. In 2021, North \nCarolina ranked in the bottom 10 states for placement stability. \n162.  Finally, the lack of appropriate foster homes has encouraged a disturbing practice \nby many County DSS of abandoning foster children in hospital emergency rooms with little agency \ncontact and no educational or mental health services. \n163.  According to North Carolina law, “[t]he State recognizes the importance of foster \nparents in the vital role of supporting children and families experiencing foster care. When children \nare removed from their parents or legal guardians, families are almost immediately integrated into \na team, including child welfare workers, resource parents, a guardian ad litem, attorneys, and \nothers who are working together to address the issues leading to the foster care.”  DHHS stated in \nNorth Carolina’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan: “Having a sufficient, diverse pool \nof foster, adoptive, and kinship families will help North Carolina achieve better outcomes for \nchildren. Specifically, having a pool of families who are diverse, well-trained, and able to meet the \nspecific needs of children in foster care will provide placement stability; ensure children and \nyouth’s well-being needs are met; allow children and youth to remain in their own schools and \ncommunities; and provide timely permanency for children and youth who are unable to return \nhome.” \n164.  A primary contributor to the lack of foster homes is DHHS/DSS’s treatment of \ncurrent and prospective foster parents. Specifically, the culture of fear and retribution in North \nCarolina deters foster parents from seeking and maintaining a license. Upon information and \nbelief, county DSS routinely retaliate against foster parents for voicing opinions or opposing DSS \nrecommendations by removing or threatening to remove their foster children, and by substantiating \nor threatening to substantiate allegations of abuse and neglect against them. Instead of being treated \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  40\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 40 of 71\n\n \nas critical members of the child welfare team, foster parents who request services for their foster \nchildren are often told that they “can’t take care of the child,” that they “are giving up on the child,” \nor that they are “getting too close to the child.” North Carolina’s treatment of foster parents causes \nfoster parents to stop accepting placements, discourages foster parents from renewing their \nlicenses, and deters prospective foster parents from seeking a license. \n165.  Adding to the recruitment and retention problem, foster parents have little to no \nrecourse  against  these  practices.  The  North  Carolina  Foster  Parents’  Bill  of  Rights  is  an \naspirational statement, not an enforceable contract. If DSS violate these rights, foster parents have \nno recourse.  \n166.  Lacking appropriate foster homes, North Carolina has increasingly relied upon \ngroup homes for placement. Sometimes referred to as “foster communities” or “campus-based \nfoster care,” these placements house children in “cottages,” each staffed by “professional parents.” \nThese “professional parents” live in the foster community and rotate in and out on a weekly basis. \nNorth Carolina’s reliance upon foster communities places children at serious risk of harm. First, \nupon information and belief, North Carolina counts a foster community as one placement even \nthough children are frequently transferred between cottage homes and “parents” within the \ncommunity. Studies suggest that “every move counts,” and North Carolina’s failure to account for \nthese intra-community moves and professional foster parent rotations obscures the scope of North \nCarolina’s placement instability problems. Second, upon information and belief, the “professional \nparent” model is incompatible with evidence-based treatments like Trauma-Based Cognitive \nBehavioral Therapy (TB-CBT) because TB-CBT requires a consistent caregiver. Additionally, the \ninsular nature of these communities restricts children’s access to health services outside the \ncommunity, and health professionals have significant difficultly providing services to children \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  41\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 41 of 71\n\n \nliving inside the community. Finally, foster care communities contribute to a lack of permanency \nbecause the children are not placed with people who, for the most part, will be interested in \nadopting them if they cannot be reunited with their parents, or are otherwise committed to their \nwell-being. \n167.  North Carolina knows or should know that its policies, practices, and customs \ncontribute to a decline in foster parent recruitment and retention, and that the failure to maintain a \nsufficient number of appropriate homes places foster children at serious risk of irreparable harm. \nIndeed, DHHS keeps an ongoing tally of children placed in inappropriate crisis settings. As DHHS \nacknowledged: “inappropriate settings compounds the trauma that children experienced during \nseparation from their families and natural support systems. The longer children are separated from \ntheir families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and they run a higher risk of \nexperiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness and involvement with the \njustice system.” \nII.  Defendants’  Policies  and  Practices  Cause  Crushing  Caseloads  and  Caseworker \nTurnover \n168.  Qualified caseworkers are vital to the administration of every child welfare system. \nThey are responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of children who are at \nrisk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. To carry out this critical task, they must assess the needs of \neach child and family, develop individualized plans to meet those needs, and monitor progress \ntoward achieving the desired outcomes. \n169.  When caseworkers have manageable caseloads, they can provide comprehensive \nand individualized services to each child and family in their care. They can take the time to build \nrapport, engage in meaningful conversations, and identify the unique needs and strengths of each \nchild and family. They can work collaboratively with other professionals and community resources \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  42\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 42 of 71\n\n \nto address complex issues and provide timely interventions. As a result, they can help ensure that \nchildren are safe, supported, and able to thrive in their families and communities. \n170.  For this to happen, the Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a national \ncoalition of agencies that develops child welfare policies, has recommended that caseloads be \nbetween 12 and 15 children per worker for children in foster care. The Council on Accreditation \n(“COA”), a national professional licensing organization, has recommended that caseloads be 12 \nto 15 children per worker and only eight children where the child is in treatment foster care. \n171.  North Carolina has set its own standards, in 10A NCAC 70G.0501, at 15 children \nfor children placed in foster family homes and at 12 children for children placed in therapeutic \nfoster homes. The counties regularly ignore and fail to maintain these standards. And DHHS does \nnot take steps to determine whether these standards are complied with. \n172.  When caseloads exceed these standards, caseworkers are unable to devote the \nnecessary time and attention to each child in their care. Additionally, overburdened workers often \nexperience burnout and high levels of stress, leading to turnover and a shortage of experienced \nworkers.  High  turnover  increases  caseload  burdens  on  remaining  caseworkers,  reduces \nproductivity and morale, increases feelings of hopelessness and frustration, and this caustic \nworkplace fuels the vicious turnover cycle. This combination of unmanageable caseloads and high \ncaseworker turnover creates a “cycle of crisis” that allows children to fall through the cracks. \n173.  Unmanageable caseloads feed caseworker turnover, which commonly results in \ndelayed permanency for foster children. One study found that foster children with one caseworker \nin a given year had an approximately 75% chance of achieving permanency, those with two \ncaseworkers had an approximately 18% chance of permanency, and those with more than three \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  43\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 43 of 71\n\n \ncaseworkers had only a 2% chance of permanency. In addition, caseworker turnover is high, with \naverage statewide turnover at 27%; one-in-four counties has a turnover rate higher than 40%. \n174.  North Carolina has been stuck in this cycle of crisis caused by crushing caseloads \nand chronic turnover. A 2016 report by the Public Consulting Group found that only half of CPS \nand in-home social workers were within the state’s recommended caseload size according to “self-\nreported” case load sizes. Staff reported that “the stress of child protection and the secondary \ntrauma and burnout of CPS leads to greater turnover, which may be an underappreciated cause by \nleadership.” When caseworkers quit, “counties must scramble to fill their position and in the \nmeantime, the responsibilities for the cases are assumed by other social workers with full caseloads \nthemselves.” \n175.  Several years later, DHHS noted in its 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan \nthat “Child welfare staff feel overwhelmed, unable to complete the work they are assigned, and \nstruggling to manage a work-life balance.” A “common theme” replayed by stakeholders was that \n“staff turnover is a major issue. County DSS staff need more training and support to mitigate this \ncritical issue.” Additionally, “barriers to implementation [of certain reforms] include current \ncaseloads of foster care staff which exceed the standard youth to staff ratio.” \n176.  According  to  North  Carolina’s  2022  Annual  Progress  and  Services  Report, \n“[r]ecent feedback from local child welfare agencies indicates that the increased workload on child \nwelfare workers has led to worker turnover and burnout.” From 2020 to 2022, turnover rates \nincreased from 23% to 34%, and vacancy rates increased from 13% to 23%. \n177.  DHHS does not verify self-reported compliance with caseload standards, nor has it \nestablished any mandatory performance metrics related to caseload standards. DHHS guidance \nprovides that “CPS Intake shall be no greater than one worker per 100 CPS referrals a month; CPS \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  44\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 44 of 71\n\n \nAssessments shall be no greater than 10 families at any time per worker; CPS In‐Home Services \nshall be no greater than 10 families at any time per worker.” Compliance with caseloads standards \nis evaluated through quarterly self-reports from county DSS and semi-annual reviews; however, \nDHHS admits that the data “is not fully vetted and verified.” \n178.  DHHS  has not  “establish[ed] a universal definition for caseload across child \nwelfare,” despite the state law requirement setting of caseload standards by child for children in \ncustody.  North Carolina’s 100 counties apply different processes to calculating caseload sizes and \ndefine “caseload” in different ways, and there is no system for weighting  blended caseloads and \nresponsibilities. Without an accurate understanding of actual caseloads across the state, and how \nmany children workers are responsible for, DHHS is incapable of addressing the caseload-turnover \ncycle of crisis. \n179.  DHHS has received numerous warnings that its failure to address the caseload and \nturnover issues threaten the safety and wellbeing of foster children. The North Carolina Office of \nState Personnel reported in 2004 that “the turnover and retention problems have become so acute \nas to seriously compromise the safety and well being of the most vulnerable children.” The 2015 \nCFSR flagged concerns related to caseloads and workloads. An independent audit by Public \nConsulting Group in 2016 notified DHHS that “[l]arge caseloads and excessive workloads make \nit difficult for CPS social workers to serve families effectively and can contribute to burnout and \nturnover” while “[m]anageable caseloads and workloads can make a real difference in a social \nworker’s ability to spend adequate time with children and families, improve staff retention, and \nultimately have a positive impact on outcomes for children and families.” The report warned that \n“[t]he lack of a consistent statewide definition of ‘caseload’ makes it difficult” to calculate \ncaseload sizes reported by county DSS. A subsequent audit by the Center for the Support of \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  45\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 45 of 71\n\n \nFamilies reprised these concerns, noting that “it is not possible for caseworkers with caseloads at \nthe current standards to meet the current expectations for their positions.” And most recently, \nDHHS was warned that “[i]ncreased workloads leave staff with less time to establish relationships \nwith children and families, conduct frequent and meaningful home visits, and make thoughtful and \nwell-supported decisions regarding safe and stable placements.” \n180.  Despite these warnings, DHHS has failed take meaningful steps to address the \nissue. DHHS committed to completing a caseload and workload study by September 2021, but \nDHHS never did, causing the North Carolina Association of County Departments of Social \nServices to ask in a January 23, 2023 meeting “are we ever going to re-evaluate case load \nstandards?” \n181.  Given the issues with caseloads and turnover, North Carolina has also faced \nongoing issues in caseworker training. The 2015 CFSR noted significant issues in initial and \nongoing staff training, which contributes to additional turnover. North Carolina received a rating \nof “Area Needing Improvement” for initial staff training, noting that “demand for and locations of \nthe  trainings  created  barriers  to  attendance  resulting  in  delayed  start  dates  for  some  new \nemployees.” Moreover, “the initial training does not fully prepare staff because it does not provide \nthem with the basic skills necessary to do their work,” and it is not clear that caseworkers are even \nengaging in the training because “the state does not have a good system for tracking staff \nparticipation in online training.” \n182.  The Public Consulting Group Report noted that “34 percent of frontline social \nworkers reported that trainings are often too full to register,” “54 percent of frontline social workers \nreported that training locations were inconvenient,” and “65 percent of frontline social workers \nreported that they are too busy with cases to attend trainings.” Moreover, supervisors and DSS \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  46\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 46 of 71\n\n \ncounty leadership reported that the training that new employees were able to attend was “not \nadequately preparing new social workers for the challenges of CPS.” Specifically, in a statewide \nsurvey, “53 percent of leadership surveyed reported that pre-service did not prepare social workers \nfor CPS” and that the “pre-service training is structured as an introduction to child welfare, but \ndoes not provide knowledge on how to do CPS work.”  \n183.  North Carolina’s crushing caseloads and chronic turnover has forced the state to \nrely on untrained and unqualified caseworkers. When hiring caseworkers, county DSS submit \napplications to the North Carolina Office of State Human Resources. When counties are unable to \nfind qualified candidates, state regulations permit counties to hire unqualified employees in a \n“work-against” status, “allowing the employee to gain the qualifications needed for the full class \nthrough on-the-job experience.” No state agency has the power to enforce these rules. The PCG \nreport showed that “smaller, more rural . . . counties have to make tradeoffs to hire social workers \nwho are not fully qualified.” Indeed, the average of qualified hires in any set of counties was at \nmost still less than 60%. \n184.  Issues with recruitment and retention have been noted in North Carolina media. For \nexample, the DSS Director for Lenoir County warned of a “recruitment and retention pandemic, \nacross the board.” In 2021, Lenoir County has a turnover rate of 61%. According to this DSS \nDirector, when turnover is that high it means supervisors have to carry a caseload or social workers \nwork more than 40 hours a week. Of the 23 social workers hired in Lenoir County, 16 were on \nwork-against status, meaning that applicants did not meet minimum standards set forth in state law \nfor the positions. The Director noted a marked increase in the numbers of work-against hires in \nthe past two years. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  47\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 47 of 71\n\n \n185.  Numerous reports and audits—including some commissioned by DHHS itself—\nhave informed the agency that caseloads are too high and that, as a result, children are at a greater \nrisk of harm. The findings and recommendations have been replicated repeatedly over the past two \ndecades. Every report identifies unmanageably high caseloads as one of the most urgent problems \nfaced by the state and explicitly warns that high caseloads compromise caseworkers’ ability to \nkeep children safe. DHHS has failed to take meaningful steps to address the problem and appears \nno closer to escaping the cycle of crisis. \nIII.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Cause Children to Languish in Foster Care \n186.  The primary goal of foster care is to provide a temporary, safe, and supportive \nenvironment for children while their parents work towards resolving the issues that led to their \nremoval or, if that is not practicable, that another permanent placement be found for the child. \nAgencies must provide services and support to parents to address the challenges they face, with \nthe ultimate aim of reunifying the child with their biological family when it is deemed safe and in \nthe child’s best interest. Alternatively, when children cannot be safely reunified with their parents, \nagencies must move expediently to ensure that children achieve permanency through adoption. \n187.  States must act swiftly to secure permanency for children because extended stays \nin foster care can disrupt a child’s sense of belonging and hinder their emotional, educational, and \nsocial development. \n188.  Data illustrates that North Carolina foster children are languishing in state custody. \nReentry rates in North Carolina dramatically increased from 2017 to 2021: 277% increase in \nchildren reentering care within 12 months of a prior episode (from 2.2% to 8.3%); 427% increase \nin children reentering care more than 12 months after a prior episode (from 1.1% to 5.8%). \n189.  North Carolina consistently ranks among the worst 10 states for reunification \n(45.6% in 2021) and among the top 4 states for guardianship (22.4% in 2021). Upon information \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  48\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 48 of 71\n\n \nand belief, county DSS routinely recommend that pre-adoptive foster parents accept guardianship \nof foster children, sometimes threatening removal if the foster parents do not. This saves DSS the \ntime and expense of going through the TPR process. But it denies the child real permanency and \ndenies guardians the financial assistance that comes with adoption.  \nIV.  Defendants Fail to Develop and Update Comprehensive Case Plans for Children and \nFamilies \n190.  DHHS and DSS are required under federal law to provide children in foster care \nwith a case plan that is reviewed regularly—at least once every six months—until a child’s case is \nresolved and the child leaves DHHS/DSS custody. These case plans focus on ways to resolve the \ncase and support the foster child, including plans to effectively engage family members and \nservices to address the family’s and the child’s needs. \n191.  DHHS fails to provide specific and updated case plans to children, instead resorting \nto “cookie cutter” case plans that are not regularly reviewed. Without effective case plans, foster \nchildren and their families go without the necessary services and support they require. \n192.  North Carolina has long known that it fails to provide timely and effective case \nplans, starting in 2015 when the CFSR found that North Carolina was not in substantial conformity \nwith the case review system, including Item 20 (written case plans), which was rated as an Area \nNeeding  Improvement.  This  was  because  “[i]nformation  in  the  statewide  assessment  and \nconfirmed during stakeholder interviews indicated that the state has no ability to monitor the \nfunctioning of this systemic factor item and that families are not consistently engaged in case \nplanning, especially non-custodial parents. Stakeholders expressed concern that parents were not \nprovided timely notification of case planning meetings and that diligent efforts to locate and serve \nnotice of the proceedings to non-custodial parents were not made. Stakeholders indicated that the \nplans are not reflective of the needs of the child and family.” \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  49\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 49 of 71\n\n \n193.  The CFSR also found that the agency made concerted efforts to involve children in \ncase planning on only 60% of cases reviewed, the agency made concerted efforts to involve \nmothers in case planning in only 67% of the cases reviewed and made concerted efforts to involve \nfathers in case planning in only 48% of the cases reviewed. The lack of involvement of families \nand children in case planning also leads to additional permanency issues and failures to obtain the \nsupportive services that foster children require.  \n194.  Similarly, a 2018 report by the Center of Support of Families, which was hired by \nNorth Carolina to review its child welfare system, found that “[c]hildren and parents are not \nconsistently engaged in the development of case plans.” Only 56% of foster cases reviewed rated \nas a strength for child and family engagement, and data suggested similar trends in engaging \nparents in case planning activities. Only 45% of counties held initial Child and Family Team \nMeetings (“CFTs”), and only 39% held ongoing CFTs.  \n195.  There is also little re-evaluation of case plans throughout the life of the case, which \nimpacts reunification and permanency efforts. For example, the Center of Support of Families \nreport found that Family Reunification Assessments were only being completed, reviewed and \nupdated approximately 50 percent of the time and that Family Services Agreements were not being \nconsistently reviewed and formally updated with parents. The report also noted that “the lack of \nconsistent quality face-to-face contact between workers and parents can also pose a barrier to \nestablishing relationships that help facilitate meaningful conversations with mothers and fathers \naround their changing needs and progress being made towards having their children returned to \nthem.” \n196.  The  lack  of  involvement  of  families  in  case  planning  and  the  lack  of \ncomprehensive, individualized, and updated assessments ensures that families and foster children \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  50\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 50 of 71\n\n \nare set up to fail. Case planning issues lead to longer times to permanency, to failures in \nreunification where reunification is possible, and to further emotional and physical harm to foster \nchildren. North Carolina has known about case planning issues for nearly a decade but has failed \nto adequately address them. \nV.  DHHS’s Failure to Establish a Reliable Information System Creates a Fragmented \nInformation Landscape And Places Foster Children at Risk of Serious Harm \n197.  Reliable information is a minimal requirement for all foster care systems. Reliable \ninformation in turn has certain minimal requirements: that it be full, complete, and comprehensive; \nthat it be accurate; and that it be available, usable, and readily accessible so that it can be relied \nupon. \n198.  Without a reliable information system, caseworkers are unable to perform critical \ntasks necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of foster children. \n199.  After  nearly  a  decade  ignoring  warnings  and  abdicating  its  leadership \nresponsibilities, DHHS has failed to establish a reliable case management system necessary to \ntrack the status and needs of children in foster care. \n200.  North Carolina’s 2015 CFSR revealed a defunct information system.  Following \nthe CFSR, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) placed DHHS on a three-\nyear Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), which set a goal for DHHS to “[e]nhance the statewide \ndata quality, collection and dissemination of information regarding services provided.” \n201.  In response, DHHS began development on a child welfare component of NC FAST, \nDHHS’s management software, called Program 4 (P4). But the development and rollout of P4 has \nproved disastrous. \n202.  The Social Services Regional Supervision and Collaboration Working Group and \nthe North Carolina Association of County Directors of Social Services both recommended that \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  51\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 51 of 71\n\n \nNorth Carolina reexamine plans to use P4 for child welfare case management. But DHHS ignored \nthese concerns and continued the rollout. \n203.  When issues persisted and counties protested, the General Assembly postponed \nimplementation of P4 and allowed counties to opt out. Of the 57 counties expected to adopt P4, \nmore than 40 counties opted out. As of 2020, “25 counties [were] using NC FAST for Intake and \nAssessment and [only] 11 pilot counties [were] using NC FAST for additional services such as In-\nHome Services and Permanency Planning.” That means 64 counties were not using NC FAST at \nall and were instead resorting to legacy computer systems and paper-based systems. In this \nfragmented landscape, data is often lost as children are moved between homes and institutions in \ndifferent counties. \n204.  DHHS’s failure to develop and implement a comprehensive electronic record and \ncase management system means that the case management problems identified over a decade ago \npersist today. Indeed, DHHS’s failures have exacerbated case management problems. Some \ncounties “are already exploring P4 alternatives including paper-based systems,” and others “are \npreparing to invest county funds to supplement their legacy systems with software that only \nsupports limited aspects of child welfare case management.” \n205.  North Carolina Senator Carl Ford expressed frustration after waiting more than a \ndecade and spending tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money on NC FAST, saying “We \njokingly call it NC Slow because it’s terrible . . .  It takes up too much time. And it just doesn’t \nwork, and we’ve wasted millions of dollars on it.’” North Carolina Senator Joyce Kraweic, \nchairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Health and Human Services, similarly \nexpressed frustration that “FedEx can track a package and tell you where it is every step of the \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  52\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 52 of 71\n\n \nway, and all about it . . . We can’t keep up with our children and where they are in NC Fast. And \nthere’s no excuse for it.” \n206.  DHHS’s failures place North Carolina’s federal funding in jeopardy, turning an \nalready perilous financial situation into a catastrophe. NC FAST was supposed to address these \ndata collection, entry, and reporting problems, but DHHS’s development and implementation of \nP4 has caused even greater fragmentation. \n207.  And DHHS knows or should know that its failure to secure and retain federal \nfunding via compliance with federal law exacerbates financial problems and places children at \nsignificant risk of serious and irreparable harm.  \nVI.  DHHS Failure to Monitor and Supervise Licensed Facilities Places Foster Children \nat Risk of Harm \n208.  DHHS is responsible for monitoring licensed homes and facilities. State law grants \nDHHS the power and responsibility to periodically review licensees to determine compliance with \nthe rules (§ 131D-10.3); to collect data on the use of restraints in residential child-care facilities (§ \n131D-10.5A); to conduct criminal background checks and determine if caretakers are fit to care \nfor foster children (§ 131D-10.3A); and to exercise its powers to protect the health and safety of \nchildren in facilities (§ 131D-10.6). \n209.  DHHS’s Division of Social Services (NC DSS) is responsible for overseeing foster \nhomes (G.S. 131D-10.2(8); NCAC 70E) and residential child-care facilities (G.S. 131D-10.2(8); \nNCAC  70I).  DHHS’s  Division  of  Health  Services  Regulation  (DHSR)  is  responsible  for \noverseeing residential treatment facilities (G.S. 122C-3(14); NCAC 27G.1300; NCAC 27G.1700; \nNCAC 27G.1800; NCAC 27G.1900). \n210.  The North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) requires DHSR to revoke a \nlicense whenever it finds: there has been failure to comply with G.S. 122C; there has been failure \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  53\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 53 of 71\n\n \nto comply with rules promulgated under G.S. 122C; and such failure to comply endangers the \nhealth, safety or welfare of the individuals in the facility (NCAC 27G .0405(d)). \n211.  Despite  these  powers  and  duties,  DHHS  does  not  regularly  inspect  licensed \nfacilities, or otherwise maintain any meaningful oversight of its licensees. \n212.  DHHS routinely fails to take any meaningful action when safety violations are \nuncovered. It issues citations, but almost never fines or suspensions. \n213.  Unlike  NC  DSS,  DHSR  publishes  its  inspection  reports.  The  DHSR  reports \n(“Statements of Deficiencies”) from 2018-2023 covering 205 facilities licensed by DHSR under \nNCAC 27G.1300, .1700, and .1800 reveal serious and chronic safety problems. \n214.  Of the 205 facilities reviewed, 57% (106) were cited for medical requirements \nviolations. Some facilities were cited multiple times, year after year. For example, Pearl’s Angel \nCare, Inc., a residential treatment facility in Cumberland County, was cited for violations of \nmedication requirements every year from 2019-2022. Children on psychotropic medications are \nbeing underdosed and overdosed, they are not provided their medication at the prescribed intervals, \nsome do not receive their medication at all, others receive medication that a doctor has not \nprescribed. Medications are stored improperly, and medical records are often pre-filled, incorrect, \nor left blank entirely. Medication issues are not properly reported to the child’s doctor, and the \nindividuals administering the medication lack the qualifications to administer such medication. \n215.  Of the 205 facilities reviewed, 40% (82) were cited for violations of minimum \nstaffing requirements. In these understaffed facilities, children are left unsupervised and are placed \nat significant risk of harm.  \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  54\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 54 of 71\n\n \n216.  Despite these facilities’ numerous and repeated violations of the NCAC, DHSR \nfails to take any meaningful enforcement action against them. Of the 205 facilities reviewed, less \nthan 1% received “penalties or serious administrative actions against their license.” \n217.  At most, the facilities are required to submit to a corrective action plan that contains \nno accountability measures. Due to the lack of any meaningful accountability, these facilities often \ncontinue to repeat these violations year after year. \n218.  DHSR’s lack of enforcement seriously endangers the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe children in these facilities. Moreover, DHHS’s knee-jerk response to news reports—that \nCounty DSS, not DHHS, are responsible—reveals that DHHS has made a deliberate choice not to \nconduct ongoing oversight based on its legally erroneous position that County DSS are responsible \nfor monitoring licensed facilities. DHHS is fully aware that its failure to monitor licensees with \nlong histories of noncompliance places foster children at serious risk of significant harm. \nVII.  DHHS’s Non-Enforcement Policy Places Foster Children at Significant Risk of  Harm \n219.  The  core  responsibility  of  supervisory  agencies  is  to  establish  performance \nrequirements, monitor compliance with the requirements, and enforce the requirements. North \nCarolina law requires DHHS to establish and implement mandatory performance requirements for \ncounty DSS child welfare services, and to develop and implement corrective action plans when \ncounty DSS do not meet those requirements. G.S. § 108A-74(a2), (a3), (c), (j). \n220.  However,  DHHS  has  established  only  one  statewide  mandatory  performance \nrequirement for county DSS child welfare services: that 95% of all foster youth have a face-to-\nface visit with the social worker each month, which is also a federal requirement which the agency \nis responsible for reporting on. DHHS has not established any additional mandatory performance \nrequirements. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  55\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 55 of 71\n\n \n221.  Even  if  DHHS  developed  meaningful  performance  requirements,  those \nrequirements would go unenforced because DHHS has adopted a formal policy abandoning the \nuse of the statutorily mandated corrective action policy. In its 2021 Oversight Report to the Joint \nLegislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, DHHS announced that “[a]s part \nof encouraging capacity-building, DHHS will no longer enforce ‘corrective action’ upon counties. \nIt will instead focus on encouraging county-level ‘development plans’ that analyze and solve \nproblems through deliberate use of evidence.” DHHS reaffirmed this policy in its 2023 Oversight \nReport. \n222.  Instead of establishing meaningful performance requirements and taking corrective \nactions, DHHS has adopted a custom and practice of assuming direct control over child welfare \nservices only after the substantial risk of harm has escalated to actual irreparable harm.  \n223.  For example, in May 2022, DHHS assumed direct responsibility for Bertie DSS \nchild welfare services based on “systematic lack of adequate training, supervision, and capacity to \ndeliver  appropriate  child  welfare  services  in  accordance  with  law,  rule,  and  policy,”  and \ndeficiencies that posed “a substantial threat to children’s safety and welfare in Bertie County.” \nThis was after a DHHS review only five months earlier purportedly concluded that Bertie DSS \nwas adequately administering the child welfare system. \n224.  No child welfare staff, including the supervisor and director, had completed the \ntraining required for their roles. Staff were unable to “describe how the concepts of safety, well-\nbeing, and permanence are integrated from the point of Intake to Adoption,” “articulate the basics \nof child welfare practice,” or “describe a rationale for their decision making.” There was also “a \ncomplete absence of leadership over child welfare services.” Additionally, documentation in all \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  56\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 56 of 71\n\n \nrecords was “minimal to non-existent,” case decisions were not supported by information or \ndocumentation, and case decisions were made without guidance or input from a supervisor. \n225.  The Bertie DSS hotline was essentially nonfunctional. Bertie DSS did not have an \nintake schedule to ensure that calls were taken, and one community member reported that “they \nhad tried calling in a report every day for a week with no response.” Staff did not log intake reports, \ndid not track screening decisions, and did not record and maintain screened-out reports. “Most \nintakes were missing crucial information, screening tools were not complete, timeframes were not \nassigned to all cases, and most intakes did not have the required two-level screening.” \n226.  DHHS’s inability to identify these obvious and systemic deficiencies in the years \nand months preceding its assumption of control over Bertie county reflects systemic disfunction \nin its supervision and monitoring of county DSS. \n227.  A supervisory agency that waits for tragedy to strike before intervening is not \nperforming its most basic responsibility. DHHS’s failure to fulfill its supervisory role threatens the \nsafety and wellbeing of North Carolina’s foster children. DHHS officials were aware of these \nproblems and the risks they posed to foster children. DHHS’s decisions to forgo mandatory \nperformance metrics and corrective action plans delayed intervention until after children suffered \nserious irreparable harm. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSubstantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n228.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n229.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to provide reasonable care to, and to protect from harm, a child with whom it has \nformed a special relationship. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  57\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 57 of 71\n\n \n230.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment, is \nobjectively unreasonable under the facts and circumstances, and amounts to deliberate indifference \nto the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all of the members of the General \nClass. Defendants are well aware and should have been aware of the policies and practices in place, \nwhich  prevent  these  class  members  from  receiving  adequate  protection  from  physical  and \npsychological harm after the State has formed a special relationship with them. As a result, the \nnamed Plaintiffs and all of the members of the class of children to whom the state owes a special \nduty, children who have a special relationship with Defendants, including wards of DHHS, have \nbeen, and are, at risk of being deprived of their substantive due process rights conferred upon them \nby the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n231.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment and repeated maltreatment, while under the \nprotective supervision of the State; \nb.  the right to protection from unnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional \nwellbeing once the State has established a special relationship with that child; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm; \nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the purpose \nof government custody; \ne.  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the \npurpose to be served by taking a child into government custody; \nf.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions of \ngovernment custody; \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  58\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 58 of 71\n\n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n232.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n233.  Plaintiffs and the class members they represent are in Defendants’ custody or \nguardianship  and  are  wholly  dependent  on  Defendants  to  provide  for  their  basic  physical, \npsychological,  and emotional needs, and to protect them from physical, psychological, and \nemotional harm. \n234.  Children frequently and foreseeably suffer physical, psychological, and emotional \nharm in DCS custody. They suffer harm in part because, in sharp contrast with the ideal of a stable \nand permanent home and family, they are continually shuttled between temporary and often non-\nfamilial custodial arrangements. Professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \nDefendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their care in stable, permanent \nhomes and families. \n235.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment and amounts \nto deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the General \nClass. \n236.  By failing to take all reasonable efforts toward fostering familial association and \nsecuring a permanent home and family for the named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent, Defendants have failed to protect them from psychologically and emotionally harmful \nshuttling between temporary living arrangements. \n237.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class have \nbeen, and are at risk of being, deprived of the right to familial association and reasonable protection \nfrom psychological and emotional harm while in Defendants’ custody, in violation of the First \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  59\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 59 of 71\n\n \nAmendment’s right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n \n238.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n239.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom of depriving the named Plaintiffs and the classes they represent of the \nrights contained in the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoptive and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, to: \na.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to achieve safe \nand appropriate foster care placements in the least restrictive and most family-like \nsetting, closest to their home community, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A), and; \nb.  a case review system in which the status of the child is reviewed no less frequently \nthan every six months by a court, or person responsible for case management, for \npurposes  of  determining  the  safety  of  the  child,  continuing  necessity  and \nappropriateness of the placement, extent of compliance with their permanency plan \nand projected date of permanency, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C). \nc.  a written case plan that contains the health records of the child, including the child’s \nknown  medical  problems,  the  child’s  medications,  and  other  relevant  health \ninformation concerning the child, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(C)(v)-(vii). \nd.  a procedure for assuring that a child’s health record is reviewed and updated, and \nthat a child’s updated health record is provided to the foster parent or foster care \nprovider at the time of placement, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(D). \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  60\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 60 of 71\n\n \ne.  In the case of a child with respect to whom the permanency plan is placement with \na relative, a description of the steps the agency has taken to determine that it is not \nappropriate for the child to be returned home or adopted, the reasons for any \nseparation of siblings, and the reasons why a permanent placement with the relative \nis in the child’s best interests. 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(F). \nf.  A plan for ensuring the educational stability of the child while in foster care. 42 \nU.S.C. § 675(1)(G). \ng.  For each child in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, DSS (i) petition \nto  terminate  the  parental  rights  of  the  child’s  parents,  subject  to  statutory \nexceptions; and (ii) concurrently identifies, recruits, processes, and approves a \nqualified family for an adoption, or documents compelling reasons for determining \nthat filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child. 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 675(5)(E). \n240.  These provisions of the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, are clearly intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \nrepresent; the rights conferred are neither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence; \nand the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n241.  Defendants have been aware, should have been aware, are aware, and should be \naware of all of the deprivations complained of herein, and Defendants have been deliberately \nindifferent to such conduct, failing to take steps to abate the risk of harm as a reasonable official \nwould. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n242.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  61\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 61 of 71\n\n \n243.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities. \n244.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,  developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2)  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DHHS. \n245.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51. Defendant Kody Kinsley is sued in his official capacities as the state official \nresponsible for supervising North Carolina programs and activities related to foster care services. \n246.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n247.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2). \n248.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  62\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 62 of 71\n\n \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n249.  Accordingly, DHHS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity \nto access foster care services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as it provides to children \nwithout disabilities in its custody. \n250.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.”  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.130(b)(7). \n251.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(2); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n252.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings and subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their disabilities, as set forth above, and \nwill continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance \nwith the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  63\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 63 of 71\n\n \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 Against Mecklenburg County, Mecklenburg County Department of Social \nServices-Youth and Family Services, Gaston County, Gaston County  \nDepartment of Social Services \n(Monell v. Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658) \n  \n253.  Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference all allegations of this Complaint as if \nfully set out herein.  \nMecklenburg County and Mecklenburg DSS-YFS \n(Asserted by Mecklenburg Subclass) \n \n254.  The Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners created a Consolidated Health \nand Human Services Agency (Mecklenburg HHS). Mecklenburg County Department of Social \nServices-Youth and Family Services (Mecklenburg DSS-YFS) is a department under Mecklenburg \nHHS.  The  Board  of  Commissioners  exercises  oversight  over  all  county  programs  and \ndepartments.  \n255.  The Director of Mecklenburg DSS-YFS is the final policymaker for all policies and \nprocedures established to govern the operations and activities of Mecklenburg DSS-YFS.  \n256.  Kim Henderson is the current Director of Mecklenburg DSS.  \n257.  Mecklenburg County and its policymaking officials are deliberately indifferent to \nplaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonable care and safety. \n258.  Mecklenburg  County  maintains  a  policy,  custom,  or  pattern  of  practice  of \ntransporting foster children to hospital emergency departments for mental health treatment and \nletting those children languish at the hospital for days and weeks beyond medical necessity because \nDSS is unable or unwilling to find an appropriate placement for the child.  Often, these emergency \ndepartments are located in hospitals that are not equipped to address mental health needs or provide \nadequate pediatric care.  Hospital staff cannot adequately supervise these children or prevent them \nfrom running away.  \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  64\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 64 of 71\n\n \n259.  During these hospital stays, children often do not receive required educational or \nsocial services. \n260.  As  a  result  of  Mecklenburg  DSS’  failure  to  provide  necessary  medical  and \neducation  services  to  children  held  in  hospitals,  the  plaintiffs’  mental  and  physical  health \ndeteriorates, and their chances of placement stability and permanency diminish. \n261.  This policy, custom, or pattern of practice violates N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-142.2. \n262.  Mecklenburg County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2021 and July 2022, one in \nthree children in the custody of Mecklenburg DSS had four or more placements. For children ages \n6-12, 35% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, 65% had four or more \nplacements. \n263.  Mecklenburg County also ranks among the worst jurisdictions (nationally and \nstatewide) for permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency \nwithin 12 months of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between July 2021 and \nJuly 2022, Mecklenburg County averaged 17% permanency within 12 months, a shockingly \nsubpar number. \n264.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Mecklenburg DSS. \n265.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand  resources.  In  fiscal  year  2023,  Mecklenburg  DSS-YFS  “experienced  significant  staff \nturnover…” And in fiscal year 2023, “experienced a decrease in placement resources for children \nin YFS custody, which has resulted in children remaining overnight in the DSS office, a hotel, or \npartner facility.” “Since July 2022, an average of 6 children per month have experienced an \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  65\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 65 of 71\n\n \novernight stay in an unlicensed arrangement. Some children stay for as little as one to two nights, \nand other have stayed several weeks.” “YFS needs increased capacity for licensed foster homes \nand emergency placements.” \nGaston County and Gaston DSS \n(Asserted by Gaston Subclass) \n \n266.  The Gaston County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. \n267.  Gaston County Board of Commissioners created a Consolidated Health and Human \nServices Agency (Gaston DHHS). Gaston County Department of Social Services (Gaston DSS) is \na department under Gaston DHHS. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all \ncounty programs and departments.  \n268.  The Director of Gaston DSS is the final policymaker for all policies and procedures \nestablished to govern the operations and activities of Gaston DSS.  \n269.  Angela Karchmer is the current Director of Gaston DSS.  \n270.  Gaston  County  and  its  policymaking  officials  are  deliberately  indifferent  to \nplaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonable care and safety. \n271.  Gaston County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2021 and July 2022, 40% \nof children in the custody of Gaston DSS had four or more placements. For children ages 6-12, \n49% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, 53% had four or more placements. \nThe median time a child spends in the custody of Gaston DSS is approximately 2 years. \n272.  Gaston County also ranks among the worst jurisdictions (nationally and statewide) \nfor permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency within 12 \n4868-5916-2845 v.1  66\nCase 3:24-cv-00783   Document 1   Filed 08/27/24   Page 66 of 71\n\n \nmonths of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between July 2021 and July 2022, \nGaston County averaged 17% permanency within 12 months, a shockingly subpar number. \n273.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Gaston DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal \nrights. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nNorth Carolina Social Services Law \n(Asserted by Mecklenburg Subclass and Gaston Subclass Against County Defendants) \n \n274.

Require that Defendants ensure that all children who enter foster care placement \nreceive within 30 days of entering care a comprehensive evaluation of the child’s \nneeds, performed by a qualified individual, including whether the child has any \nphysical and/or mental disabilities sufficient to be categorized as a child with \ndisabilities under the ADA and that the child be reevaluated as the child’s needs \nand the information available to Defendants change; \ng.  Require that Defendants ensure that all children who enter foster care placement \nreceive within 60 days of entering care an adequate and individualized written case \nplan for treatment, services, and supports to address the child’s identified needs; \ndescribing a plan for reunification with the child’s parents, for adoption, or for \nanother  permanent,  family-like  setting;  describing  any  interim  placements \nappropriate for the child while the child moves toward a permanent home-like \nsetting; and describing the steps needed to keep the child safe during the child’s \ntime in Defendants’ custody; \nh.  Require that Defendants ensure that all children whose case plan identifies a need \nfor services and/or treatment timely receive those services and/or treatment; \ni.  Require Defendants to file and proceed with a timely petition to free a child for \nadoption when the child’s permanency plan is adoption, unless the child’s case plan \ndocuments show that doing so is not in the child’s best interest or that the child has \na statutory exemption from this requirement; \nj.

      "text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA \nCHARLOTTE DIVISION \nCivil Action No. 3:24-cv-00783 \nJameson C., minor, by next friend    \nSTEVEN BOLCH et al.,    \n   \n                  Plaintiffs,  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nv.  AND GASTON COUNTY \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO \nROY COOPER, et. al., \nDISMISS \n \n                  Defendants. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE \n \nThe disputed issues are (I) whether the Next Friends have standing; (II) whether Plaintiffs \nstate cognizable claims under the U.S. Constitution, (IV) the American with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) and Rehabilitation Act, and (V) the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 \n(“AAWCA”); and (III) whether Plaintiffs establish liability under Monell. First, the Next Friends \nsatisfy the requirements for standing in the unique context of foster care, and dismissal would be \nunwarranted even if the Next Friends did not satisfy standing requirements. Second, Plaintiffs \nsufficiently allege that County Defendants are deliberately indifferent to substantial risks of serious \nharm in violation of Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights; have impaired meaningful contact \nwith parents and siblings in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights of familial association; have violated \nmandatory,  specific,  and  individually-focused  provisions  of  AAWCA;  and  have  increased \nPlaintiffs’ risk of institutionalization in violation of their rights under the ADA. Finally, Plaintiffs \nsufficiently state that County Defendants’ omission manifests deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ \nrights, and that the alleged customs and practices are sufficiently widespread and pervasive as to \n \nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 1 of 25\n\n \nattribute them to the County. Plaintiffs ask this court to deny County Defendants’ motions to \ndismiss. \n* * * \nNorth Carolina’s counties are tired of playing scapegoat for the State’s failures. After all, \nMecklenburg County argues, “the system is governed by State law and DHHS, not the counties,” \nDHHS is responsible “for administering or supervising the administration of the Child Welfare \nServices Program in North Carolina” and “is responsible for supervising all 100 county DSS,” and \n“binding regulations promulgated by DHHS define the duties and responsibilities of county DSS.” \nSee ECF No. 47 at 5 (cleaned up). And why, Mecklenburg County asks, should counties be held \nliable for violations of AACWA when DHHS is responsible for preparing the state plan? See id. \nat 13. \nWhile Plaintiffs are sympathetic to this frustration with DHHS’s lack of leadership and \noversight, the Counties also bear responsibility for the risk of harm posed to North Carolina’s \nfoster children. Counties must administer the child welfare system and hire enough qualified \ncaseworkers to do so; they must investigate reports of abuse and neglect and take action to protect \nchildren from harm; they are responsible for recruiting, training, and supporting foster parents, for \ncompleting licensure applications for submission to DHHS, and for supervising foster homes; and \nthey are responsible for case planning and for visiting children in foster homes to ensure their \nsafety. See First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), ECF No. 37, ¶ 240-42. \nTo be sure, lack of assistance from the State makes an already difficult task even more \narduous. But this does not immunize Defendants Gaston County, Gaston County Department of \nSocial  Services,  Mecklenburg  County,  and  Mecklenburg  Department  of  Social  Services \n(collectively, “County Defendants”) from liability. County Defendants’ policies and practices, \n  2\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 2 of 25\n\n \nactions and inactions, evince deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of harm they pose to \nfoster children, deprive foster children of meaningful contact with their parents and siblings, \nincrease disabled foster children’s risk of institutionalization, and violate foster children’s rights \nunder federal and state law. Accordingly, this court should deny County Defendants’ motions to \ndismiss. \nI.  Plaintiffs’ Next Friends Have Standing to Bring Claims on Their Behalf \nThere are two requirements for a Next Friend to have standing: “First, a ‘next friend’ must \nprovide  an  adequate  explanation—such  as  inaccessibility,  mental  incompetence,  or  other \ndisability—why the real party in interest cannot appear on his own behalf to prosecute the action”;  \nand “[s]econd, the ‘next friend’ must be truly dedicated to the best interests of the person on whose \nbehalf he seeks to litigate.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 163 (1990). Given that a minor \ncannot sue on his or her own behalf, Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides \nthat “[a] minor . . . who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or \nby a guardian ad litem.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2).  \nThe County Defendants both rely on Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 294 F.3d. 598 (4th Cir. 2002), \nwhich held that, as a general rule, a Next Friend must have some kind of “significant relationship” \nwith the plaintiff. Id. at 603-04. Hamdi, however, clarified that where an individual “has no \nsignificant relationships,” a significant relationship might not be required in order to allow the \nplaintiff to proceed through a next friend. Id. at 604 (“We do not have here the situation of someone \nwho has no significant relationships. If we did, this might be a different case.”); see also Coal. of \nClergy, Lawyers & Professors v. Bush, 310 F.3d 1153, 1162 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he contours of \nthe requisite ‘significant relationship’ do not remain static, but must necessarily adapt to the \ncircumstances.”). \n  3\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 3 of 25\n\n \nNumerous courts have recognized that the peculiar realities of foster care require such a \nflexible approach to the significant-relationship requirement. The First Circuit aptly explained:  \n[D]ue to maltreatment, multiple placements, and social and psychological issues, \nfoster care children are often unable to forge significant relationships with the \nadults that are entrusted to protect the children’s interests. The fact that Plaintiffs \nfiled suit against their legal guardian for alleged violations of the state’s obligations \nas their guardian and custodian further informs our analysis.  \n \nSam M. v. Carcieri, 608 F.3d 77, 89 (1st Cir. 2010); see also Elisa W. v. City of N.Y., 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 33857, at *29 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2018) (“[C]hildren in foster care . . . are subject to \nunique circumstances that make it unlikely that someone with a substantial relationship is willing \nto be their proxy in a federal action.”); Tinsley v. Flanagan, No. CV-15-00185-PHX-ROS, 2016 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 193289, at *23 (D. Ariz. May 13, 2016) ( “It would be nonsensical to require \nfoster children [to] develop significant relationships before coming to court to ask for help to \ndevelop significant relationships”).  \nOften in these cases, there are no other adults “willing or able to represent the Named \nPlaintiff Children.” E.g. Elisa W., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33857, at *47; Tinsley, 2016 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 193289, at *24. As a result, these courts have permitted Next Friends with “minimal, to \nnon-existent”  relationships  with  the  plaintiff  children  to  represent  them  as  long  as  they \ndemonstrated they were dedicated to their best interests and could adequately prosecute the case \non their behalf. Id., at *44-51; Sam M., 608 F.3d at 92-94; Tinsley, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193289, \nat *30. \nThese same circumstances exist here and justify Veronika Monteleone’s representation of \nAnnie W., Justin B., and Morgan G. (the “Mecklenburg Plaintiffs”). As the FAC clearly shows, \nthese children, all of whom have a history of trauma from abuse and neglect, which makes forming \ntrusting relationships with adults challenging, and have, subsequent to removal from their homes, \n  4\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 4 of 25\n\n \nbeen shuttled from placement to placement by County Defendants, experienced even further abuse \nand neglect at many of those placements, and were generally deprived of the ability to form stable \nand secure relationships with the adults in their lives. For example, since DSS took Annie W. into \ncustody, she has been in 22 different placements, including three different Psychiatric Residential \nTreatment Facilities. FAC ¶ 46. Justin B. has been placed in over 18 placements. Id. ¶ 55. The only \nadult in recent history with whom Justin “had developed a trusting relationship” was his therapist, \nwho specialized in trauma and sexual abuse, and DSS abruptly terminated the relationship after \nJustin’s pre-adoptive placement was disrupted. Id. ¶ 61. Morgan G. has been in more than 20 \ndifferent placements, with many placements lasting no more than a few days. Id. ¶¶ 76, 82, 85, 87, \n95.  \nVeronika Monteleone has spent nearly a decade representing children in court, is familiar \nwith North Carolina’s foster care system, has acquainted herself with the allegations in the \nComplaint regarding the Mecklenburg Plaintiffs, and is dedicated to their best interests. FAC ¶¶ \n42, 50, 70. Under these circumstances, she is an adequate Next Friend to the Mecklenburg \nPlaintiffs.   \nGaston County’s attack of Mr. Bolch’s qualifications to represent Jameson C. is even \nweaker. Mr. Bolch is not a stranger to Jameson; rather, he fostered Jameson for 18 months. Id. ¶ \n11. Hamdi declined to decide “how significant” the relationship had to be to satisfy Next Friend \nstatus, 294 F.3d at 604, and Mr. Bolch’s relationship with Jameson would certainly satisfy that \nrequirement here. Even after Mr. Bolch ceased fostering Jameson, his new foster parents continued \nto contact Mr. Bolch to seek advice on Jameson’s behavioral issues. FAC ¶ 24. Jameson’s \ncaseworker likewise contacted Mr. Bolch for advice on Jameson’s medication regimen. Id. Mr. \n  5\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 5 of 25\n\n \nBolch’s  continuity  of care  and  interest  in  Jameson’s  wellbeing  clearly  evinces  that  he has \nJameson’s best interest at heart and will represent him adequately in this litigation. \nFinally, even if either of these Next Friends were deemed inadequate, “Rule 17(c) was not \nintended to be a vehicle for dismissing claims” as that would be inconsistent with the “purpose of \nRule 17(c) . . . to further the child’s interest in prosecuting or defending a lawsuit.” Gardner v. \nParson, 874 F.2d 131, 140 (3d Cir. 1989); see also Davis v. Walker, 745 F.3d 1303, 1310 (9th Cir. \n2014) (same); Elisa W., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33857, at *46 (“It is difficult to understand how \ndismissal on non-merits grounds protects the interests of the Named Plaintiff Children.”). Rule 17 \nrequires the court to “appoint a guardian ad litem—or issue another appropriate order—to protect \na minor . . . who is unrepresented in an action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2). Thus, the proper relief \nfor a Next Friend lacking standing is to order substitute representation so that Plaintiffs may \ncontinue to prosecute their claims.  \nII.  Plaintiffs State Cognizable Constitutional Claims \nA.  Substantive Due Process \n \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally acts as a “limitation on \nthe State’s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.” \nDeshaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989). But “when the State \ntakes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon \nit a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.” Id. \nat 199-200. \nThis “special relationship” exception is well-settled in the foster care context. See Doe v. \nS.C. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 597 F.3d 163, 175 (4th Cir. 2010); Pinder v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1169, \n1174 (4th Cir. 1995). Having immediate physical custody of foster children, counties have an \n  6\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 6 of 25\n\n \naffirmative duty to ensure that foster children are protected against physical and psychological \nharm.1 A county violates its constitutional duty when there is a known or obvious risk of harm \nposed  to  children  in  custody,  and  the  county’s  deliberate  action  or  inaction  is  objectively \nunreasonable in light of those known or obvious risks. See Short v. Hartman, 87 F.4th 593, 611 \n(4th Cir. 2023).2 \nCounty Defendants are aware of the risks of harm posed to foster children. See infra Sec. \nIII. The only question, then, is whether the asserted rights are cognizable. The County Defendants \ndispute the cognizability of Plaintiffs’ “purported rights.” See ECF No. 47 at 9; ECF No. 52 at 7. \nFor example, Gaston County asserts that none of the rights Plaintiffs allege fall within the “basic \nhuman needs” of foster children that are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. ECF No. 52 at \n7.  \nNot so. Courts have consistently held that the scope of foster children’s substantive due \nprocess right is broad and encompasses exactly those rights that Plaintiffs allege.  See, e.g., \nJonathan R. v. Justice, No. 3:19-cv-00710, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6658, at *21 (S.D. W. Va. Jan. \n13, 2023) (foster children’s right to protection of their well-being extends to emotional as well as \n \n1 Accord ECF No. 47 at 8 (Mecklenburg Motion) (“[T]he State must provide children in its custody \npersonal security and reasonably safe living conditions free from an unreasonable risk of both \nphysical and psychological harm.” (citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315, 321 (1982))). \n2 County Defendants also allege that a defendants’ behavior must be “conscious-shocking” to \nviolate due process. See ECF No. 47 at 8; ECF No. 52 at 6 (Gaston Motion). This is mere rhetoric. \nAnd Plaintiffs’ allegations satisfy this standard as “[r]eckless indifference to a child’s safety would \ndoubtless shock the conscience.” See Slade v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Milwaukee, 702 F.3d 1027, 1033 \n(7th Cir. 2012). Notably, however, this kind of rhetoric has been modified in more recent \nrecitations of the deliberate indifference standard. See Short, 87 F.4th at 611 (adopting objective \ndeliberate indifference standard which requires plaintiff to show that the defendant knew or should \nhave known of the risk of harm to the plaintiff and “the defendant’s action or inaction was . . . \n‘objectively unreasonable’”); see also Doe v. Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Ctr. Comm’n, 985 F.3d \n327,  342  (4th  Cir.  2021)  (defendant  with  custody  over  minor  plaintiff  “fails  to  provide  a \nconstitutionally adequate level of . . . care if it substantially departs from accepted professional \nstandards”) (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323)). \n  7\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 7 of 25\n\n \nphysical well-being) (citing cases); id. at *23 (recognizing “the right to conditions and duration of \nfoster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody, and the right not to be \nmaintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a \nchild into government custody”); M.D. v. Abbott, 152 F. Supp. 3d 684, 696 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (right \nto “protection from psychological as well as physical abuse”); Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. \n662, 675 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“right to be free from unreasonable and unnecessary intrusions into \ntheir emotional well-being”); Hernandez v. Tex.

Supp. 2d 543, 556 (S.D. Miss. 2004); Connor B. v. Patrick, 771 \nF. Supp. 2d 142, 161 (D. Mass. 2011) (“the right to remain in custody no longer than necessary \nunder the circumstances, the right to receive care and treatment in accordance with accepted \nstandards of professional judgment, and the right to be placed in the least restrictive environment”); \nHenry A. v.

Sundquist, 149 F. Supp. 2d 941, 953-54 (M.D. Tenn. \n2000) (“the right not to be deprived of [] liberty unnecessarily by retention in state custody” and \nthe “right to be placed in the least restrictive, most appropriate, family-like setting while in state \ncustody”). \nMecklenburg County attempts to overcome this substantial weight of authority by citing a \nfew stray cases that are either against the weight of authority or otherwise distinguishable.  \nFirst, citing Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 507 (D.N.J. 2000), Mecklenburg \nCounty argues that there is “no due process right to not remain in state custody unnecessarily or \nbe housed in the least restrictive, most appropriate family-like placement.” ECF No. 47 at 9. But, \n  8\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 8 of 25\n\n \nas discussed above, the majority of courts addressing such claims hold these rights fall squarely \nwithin the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection. E.g. Jonathan R., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6658, at \n*23; Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 161; Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at 953-54. Understandably so. \nThe legal basis for taking a child into custody is to protect the child from imminent safety risks. \nOnce those risks have been eliminated—either because the parents resolved the issues that led to \nthe child’s removal, or because the parents’ rights were terminated to free the child for adoption—\nthe legal basis for custody expires. Custody that continues unnecessarily and indefinitely causes \nchildren’s mental health and wellbeing to deteriorate significantly, which decreases the likelihood \nof permanency. See FAC ¶¶ 60, 244. Plaintiffs allege facts showing that both County Defendants \nare deliberately indifferent to the risks associated with prolonged and unnecessary custody.3 \nSecond, citing Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302-03 (1993), Mecklenburg County argues \nthat there is “no due process protection for placement decisions.” In fact, the right asserted in Reno \nwas a right “to be placed in the custody of a willing-and-able private custodian rather than of a \ngovernment-operated or government-selected child-care institution.” Id at 302. Plaintiffs do not \nassert  such  a right  here.  Plaintiffs  do,  however,  assert  a  right  to  protection  against  unsafe \nplacements. And the Fourth Circuit has held that the constitutional duty owed to foster children \n“includes a duty not to make a foster care placement that is deliberately indifferent to the child’s \nright to personal safety and security.” Doe, 597 F.3d at 175. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege facts \n \n3 For example, Annie W. has been in the custody of Mecklenburg County for nearly 10 years, 6 of \nwhich she has been a legal orphan. See FAC ¶¶ 42-43. Mecklenburg County has failed to find a \npermanent home for Justin B after nearly a decade in custody. Id. ¶ 68. DSS has no made plans for \nMorgan G. to obtain permanency after a decade of custody and now he is only a few years away \nof aging out of the foster care system. Id. ¶¶ 71, 95. Jameson C. has been in foster care for half his \nlife, and Gaston DSS has refused to file a petition to terminate parental rights. Id. ¶¶ 19, 26. \n  9\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 9 of 25\n\n \nshowing that County Defendants made placements that were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ \nright to personal safety and security.4  \nThird, citing  K.H. Through Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F.2d 846, 853 (7th Cir. 1990), \nMecklenburg  County  argues  that  there  is  no  due  process  right  to  a  “stable  foster-home \nenvironment.” ECF No. 47 at 9. The question in K.H., however, was whether the right was clearly \nestablished  for  purposes  of  qualified  immunity  from  damages,  not  whether  the  right  was \ncognizable.  K.H,  914  F.2d  at  853.  Indeed,  the  court  explicitly  set  aside  the  question  of \ncognizeability “to be explored not in damages suits but in equity actions” Id. And the K.H. court \nsuggested that precisely what Plaintiffs allege here is a cognizable right: “The wrong lies not in \nthe shuttle itself . . . but in a system of foster care that is unable to achieve a reasonable balance \namong safety, competence, and stability.” Id. Plaintiffs allege facts showing that the County \nDefendants have failed abjectly to achieve a reasonable balance between safety, competence, and \nstability; and that as a consequence of this imbalance and instability, Plaintiffs have suffered and \nare at risk of suffering serious risk of harm.5 \nFinally, citing Youngberg, Mecklenburg County argues that due process only requires the \ncounty to provide “minimally adequate care and treatment.” ECF No. 47 at 9. Plaintiffs, however, \nare not asking for optimal treatment; they are asking for the constitutional minimum. And the \nallegations contained in the Amended Complaint show that the County Defendants fail to provide \n \n4 See, e.g., FAC ¶ 14 (Jameson C. in various placements where he never received necessary mental \nhealth treatment and was overprescribed psychotropic medications); ¶¶ 46-47 (Annie W. placed \nin unsafe placements, including hospital emergency departments, that could not support her mental \nhealth or educational needs); ¶¶ 52, 55-56, 59-60, 63-66 (Justin B. in placements with known \nsafety risks, where his individualized need could not be met); ¶¶ 79, 82-84, 87-88, 90-94 (Morgan \nG. in out-of-state facility despite not meeting medical criteria and without information or records \nnecessary to adequately care for his needs).  \n5 See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 13-14, 46-47, 55-57, 63, 66, 73-74, 76, 82-85, 94-95.  \n  10\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 10 of 25\n\n \nthe most basic treatment to the Plaintiffs.6 Courts routinely deny motions to dismiss where the \nagency failed to provide medical or mental health treatment that it knew or should have known \nwas necessary. See, e.g., Jeremiah M. v. Crum, 695 F. Supp. 3d 1060, 1093 (D. Alaska 2023) \n(denying motion to dismiss in response to allegations that “Plaintiffs are not receiving medical or \nbehavioral services, despite [the agency’s] knowledge of their need for those services, and that \n[the agency] fails to notify foster parents of children’s medical and behavioral needs.”). \nPlaintiffs sufficiently state cognizable substantive due process rights and violations thereof. \nB.  Familial Association \n \nThe right to familial association is deeply rooted in the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and the denial of meaningful contact with parents and siblings constitutes an \nintrusion into this right.7 \nMecklenburg  County’s  motion  does  little  more  than  state  that  the  right  to  familial \nassociation is a negative right against unjustified intrusion and does not impose any affirmative \nobligations. See ECF No. 47 at 10-11. This restatement of law is accurate but nonresponsive. \nPlaintiffs’ theory is that Defendants’ policies and practices—including the failure to engage in \nmeaningful permanency planning, failure to provide reunification services, and placement in \n \n6 See, e.g., FAC ¶ 14 (Jameson C. in various placements where he never received necessary mental \nhealth treatment or specialized therapy); ¶¶ 45-47 (Annie W. did not receive adequate care or \ntreatment in extended hospital stays, causing her health and wellbeing to deteriorate and placing \nher at increased risk of institutionalization); ¶¶ 54, 56, 63, 65 (Justin B. did not receive timely care \nand mental health treatment in rapid response home, hospital emergency room, or residential \ntreatment program); ¶¶ 59-60 (DSS failed to notify placement of Justin B.’s medical and behavioral \nneeds, resulting in placement disruption); ¶ 61 (DSS disrupted Justin B.’s mental health treatment); \n¶ 83 (DSS failed to provide information to placement about Morgan G.’s medical and behavioral \nneeds); ¶¶ 87-95 (Morgan G. did not received adequate care and mental health treatment in \nhospital, placing him at serious risk of life-threatening situations and incarceration). \n7 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference their discussion from their Opposition to DHHS Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss (“DHHS Opposition”). See ECF No. 92 at 14-15. \n  11\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 11 of 25\n\n \ndistant and out-of-state locations—result in the systematic and unjustifiable intrusion upon the \nparent-child and sibling relationships of foster children while in custody, and Plaintiffs allege facts \nshowing that County Defendants have intruded on this right.8 \nGaston County argues separately that there can be no plausible violation as to Jameson C. \nbecause Plaintiffs’ allege familial association was improper in his case. See ECF No. 52 at 8. But \nallegations that the county improperly facilitated visits between parents and children does not \nmilitate against Plaintiffs. It simply reinforces that the right is protected against unjustified state \ninterference. The county justifiably interferes with the right to familial association when it removes \na child from their parents due to imminent safety risks. And it justifiably interferes with the right \nto familial association when it ceases visitations that threaten the child’s safety and wellbeing. For \nexample, the county should have justifiably ceased visitation in the case of Jameson C. when it \nbecame  apparent  that  such  associations  were threatening  their  safety  and  wellbeing.  These \ncountervailing interests justify intrusion into the parent-child relationship. But a lack of adequate \nplacements that results in out-of-state or distant placements is not a countervailing interest that \njustifies intrusion into parent-child relationships. Nor is it a lack of qualified caseworkers that \nresults in delayed and denied family reunification services. \nIII.  Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege the Remaining Elements of Monell Liability.  \n \nThe County Defendants argue that even if there were underlying constitutional violations, \nPlaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that they were caused by an official policy or custom of \nDefendants. See ECF No. 47 at 16-17; ECF No. 52 at 9-10. These arguments both ignore the \nvarious ways in which a Monell claim can be proven and the numerous allegations in the Amended \nComplaint that support Plaintiffs’ Monell claims.  \n \n8 See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 13, 26, 55, 67, 73-74, 82-84. \n  12\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 12 of 25\n\n \nAlthough the County Defendants correctly articulate the four-pronged test for proving \nMonell liability in Lytle v. Doyle, 326 F.3d 463, 471 (4th Cir. 2003), their discussion completely \noverlooks the third prong: namely, “an omission, such as a failure to properly train . . . that \nmanifests deliberate indifference to the rights of citizens.” Id. (cleaned up). Moreover, as to \ndeficiencies in formal programs, “the design and implementation of training programs and the \nfollow-up supervision of trainees, is necessarily a matter of ‘policy’ within the meaning of \nMonell.” Spell v. McDaniel, 824 F.2d 1380, 1389 (4th Cir. 1987). “To the extent such an official \nmunicipal  policy  has  deficiencies  resulting  from  municipal  fault  that  then  cause  specific \nconstitutional violations by deficiently trained [workers], the municipality is liable under 42 U.S.C. \n§  1983.”  Id.  Municipal  policy  makers  need  not  expressly,  or  even  tacitly,  authorize  these \ndeficiencies to incur Monell liability. Id. at 1390. Liability can accrue based on “failures adequately \nto prohibit or discourage readily foreseeable conduct in light of known exigencies of . . . duty.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs specifically allege a failure to train, as well as a host of other omissions and \ninactions, that are the moving force behind their constitutional deprivations. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 273-\n75 (failure to train); ¶¶ 263-68, 271 (failure to maintain manageable caseload standards); ¶¶ 264-\n68, 275 (failure to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified caseworkers); ¶¶ 245-46, 251 \n(failure to license, recruit, and retain a sufficient number of appropriate and safe foster homes); ¶¶ \n245, 254, 256, 258, 283, 285, 287 (failure to provide necessary services), ¶¶ 258, 265 280-81, 285, \n287-88, (failure to achieve permanency); ¶¶ 282-88 (failure to perform adequate case planning).  \nMecklenburg  County  contends  that  “a  severe  lack  of  staff and  resources”  does  not \nconstitute a “custom or usage with the force of law.” ECF No. 47 at 17. Again, this misconstrues \nPlaintiffs’ theory of liability—here premised on omission evincing deliberate indifference. Lytle, \n326 F.3d at 471. Furthermore, severe staffing shortages that result in a substantial risk of harm to \n  13\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 13 of 25\n\n \nthe plaintiff can sufficiently establish a Monell claim. See Murray v. S.C. Dep’t of Corr., Civil \nAction No. 6:19-00100-RMG-MGB, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188336, at *53-54 (D.S.C. May 5, \n2020) (denying summary judgment on Monell claim where there was “a question of fact as to \nwhether the severe staff shortage at [the prison] and the resulting security issues created a \nsubstantial risk of harm to Plaintiff”).  \nPlaintiffs also adequately allege how these omissions or inactions expose them to a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm to their physical and emotional well-being, thus causing their \nconstitutional deprivations. E.g., id. ¶ 245 (County DSS’s failure to license, recruit, and retain a \nsufficient number of appropriate foster homes, and to provide necessary supports to those homes \ncauses  children  to  be  housed  in  unsafe  and  inappropriate  settings);  id.  (“‘Living’  in  these \ninappropriate settings compounds the trauma that children experience during separation from their \nfamilies and natural support systems.”); ¶ 253 (“The lack of appropriate foster homes in North \nCarolina has led to a dramatic increase in placement instability.”); ¶ 244 (“Placement instability \nproduces a cascade of intersecting and compounding harms . . .”); ¶ 258 (reliance upon group \nhomes for placement “places children at serious risk of harm”); ¶ 279 (“States must act swiftly to \nsecure permanency for children because extended stays in foster care can disrupt a child’s sense \nof belonging and hinder their emotional, educational, and social development.”); ¶ 288 (“Case \nplanning issues lead to longer times to permanency, to failures in reunification where reunification \nis possible, and to further emotional and physical harm to foster children.”); ¶ 260 (failure to recruit \nand retain qualified caseworkers endangers the vital role they play in “ensuring the safety, \npermanency, and well-being of children who are at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation”).  \nPlaintiffs also allege a theory of Monell liability under the fourth prong of Lytle: through \n“practice that is so ‘persistent and widespread’ as to constitute a ‘custom or usage with the force \n  14\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 14 of 25\n\n \nof law.’” 326 F.3d at 471. For example, Plaintiffs allege that the County Defendants routinely \nhouse foster children in inappropriate and unsafe settings, such as DSS offices, jails, hotel rooms, \nhomeless shelters, and hospital emergency rooms. E.g., FAC ¶¶ 245-46, 250-52. With respect to \nthe latter, Plaintiffs specifically allege that County DSS has developed “a disturbing practice . . . \nof abandoning foster children in hospital emergency rooms with little agency contact and no \neducational or mental health services.” Id. ¶ 254. Plaintiffs also allege that County Defendants \nhave fostered a “culture of fear and retribution” against foster parents for requesting services for \nthe children they foster, or “for voicing opinions or opposing DSS recommendations.” Id. ¶ 256. \nThese retaliatory practices exacerbate County Defendants’ foster home recruitment and retention \nproblems. Id. ¶ 257.  \nThe County Defendants ignore all these factual allegations and focus myopically on the \nhandful of allegations that fall under the Fifth Cause of Action in the Amended Complaint. See id. \n¶¶ 346-366. But this narrow lens misses the point. The official federal and state audits, numerous \npress articles, and statements of high-ranking officials, such as DHHS’s Susan Osborne speaking \nto Directors of County DSS across the State, id. ¶ 246, only further underscore that these problems \nare widespread throughout the State. They are not isolated incidents concentrated in one particular \nCounty. To the contrary, this continuous coverage of an entire system “in ‘crisis,’” id., supports \nthe inference that this “pattern of comparable practices has become actually or constructively \nknown to responsible policymakers,” as is required to prove a Monell pattern or practice claim. \nSee Howard v. City of Durham, 68 F.4th 934, 952 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting Spell, 824 F.2d at 1391).  \nMoreover, the statistics Plaintiffs cite regarding County Defendants’ placement instability \n(FAC ¶¶ 354, 364), delayed permanency outcomes (id. ¶¶ 355, 365), and severe staffing (id. ¶ 357) \nand foster home shortages (id. ¶ 363)—none of which Defendants refute—create the reasonable \n  15\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 15 of 25\n\n \ninference that these factual allegations of persistent problems throughout the State also exist in \nMecklenburg and Gaston. See Murray, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188336, at *53-54 (unrefuted \nstatistics of widespread staffing shortages in prison supported claim that plaintiff’s individual \nhousing area was understaffed during alleged unconstitutional violation); Doe v. Citadel, No. 2:21-\ncv-04198-DCN, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127707, at *38 (D.S.C. July 18, 2022) (“statistics ‘may \nprovide  context’  when  combined  with  other  circumstantial  evidence”  of  unconstitutional \nconduct).9  \nWhat is more, Mecklenburg fails to even address Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding its \ncustom or pattern of practice of abandoning foster children in hospital emergency departments \nwithout adequate services or safety. FAC ¶¶ 350-53. Indeed, the Mecklenburg Plaintiffs’ stories \nare all illustrative of this practice. See id. ¶¶ 47 (Annie W.); 63-65 (Justin B.); 87-94 (Morgan G.).  \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently state a claim for Monell liability against the \nCounty Defendants. Given the amount of already publicly available information supporting their \nclaims, Plaintiffs are confident that further discovery will only yield additional evidence of official \npolicies, practices, and/or omissions by County Defendants that are the moving force behind \nPlaintiffs’ injuries.  \nIV.  Plaintiffs Sufficiently State Claims Under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nPlaintiffs incorporate by reference their discussion of Title II of the ADA, its corresponding \nregulations, and the binding precedents interpreting them from their DHHS Opposition. See ECF \n \n9 Gaston County also argues that Plaintiffs’ statistics regarding permanency delays and placement \ninstability lack context because they do not consider “the frequency of, or justification for, the \nchanges in placements.” ECF 52 at 10. This argument misses the point. “Plaintiffs’ claims turn not \non the cause of permanency delays [or placement changes] for any particular child, but on whether \n[Defendants’] practices lead to permanency delays [and placement instability] thereby placing all \nfoster children at an unreasonable risk of harm.” Elisa W. v. City of N.Y., 82 F.4th 115, 126 (2d \nCir. 2023).  \n  16\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 16 of 25\n\n \nNo. 92 at 18-20. County Defendants’ attack on the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ allegations respecting \nthese claims ring hollow. First, they contend that Plaintiffs do not allege what specific disabilities \nthey have. See ECF No. 47 at 13; ECF No. 52 at 12. But the Amended Complaint does exactly \nthat. Plaintiffs allege that the ADA Subclass “have behavioral, developmental and psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals  within the meaning of  the ADA . . . [and] \nRehabilitation Act.” FAC ¶ 336.  \nSecond, County Defendants assert that Plaintiffs do not allege what actions or inactions of \ntheirs constitute actionable discrimination or otherwise violate the ADA or Rehabilitation Act. \nECF No. 47 at 13-14; ECF No. 52 at 12. Defendants appear to be arguing that the FAC fails to \ngive them adequate notice of the substance of the claim; however, this argument belies reality and \nignores the abundant allegations in the FAC that portray Defendants’ violations of the ADA’s and \nRehabilitation Act’s integration mandate. Indeed, Mecklenburg County demonstrates that it knows \nfull well the nature of the claim when it asserts that “[t]o the extent the allegations state that \nPlaintiffs seek placement in the most integrated environment appropriate to children’s needs and \nnot placed in overly restricted settings, the claim still fails as a matter of law.” ECF No. 47 at 13.  \nThe FAC provides adequate notice of this claim. The ADA Subclass alleges that they “have \nbeen or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive settings and subjected to unnecessary trauma \nbecause of their disabilities.” FAC ¶ 344. And several allegations in the FAC explain exactly how \nCounty Defendants create this risk. Specifically, County Defendants’ frequently place children in \noverly restrictive settings, including congregate care facilities, psychiatric residential treatment \nfacilities, and, all too often, hospital emergency departments, when they are not medically \nnecessary, nor even responsive to their psychiatric needs. Id. ¶¶ 47, 63-65, 87-94, 245-46, 250-52, \n350-53.  \n  17\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 17 of 25\n\n \nCounty Defendants next argue that the statutes do not require States to “provide a certain \nlevel of benefits to individuals with disabilities.” ECF No. 47 at 14 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. \nat 603 n.14); ECF No. 52 at 12 (same). But this argument rests on a faulty reading of Olmstead. \nThe very next sentence in the quoted footnote says that “States must adhere to the ADA’s \nnondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services they in fact provide.” Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 603 n.14. As one court aptly explained when rejecting this identical argument:  \nDefendants here offer a service—the foster care system—to Plaintiffs. And when \noffering this service, Defendants must make reasonable modifications so that \nPlaintiffs can fully participate in it. Requiring Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with \nmental  health  services  and  disability  supports  is  entirely  consistent  with  this \nmandate—these services are necessary for Plaintiffs to participate in the foster care \nsystem, and they are not entirely new, stand-alone programs. \n \nJonathan R., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6658, at *58. For the same reasons, Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 303 (1985), and Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 619 (2d Cir. 1999), are \ndistinguishable.  \n  Lastly, County Defendants vaguely assert that Plaintiffs have no support for their position \nthat  disabled  children  must  be  “placed  in  the  ‘most  integrated  environment’  regardless  of \ncircumstances or resources.” ECF No. 47 at 14; ECF No. 52 at 13. To the extent Defendants are \nasserting a fundamental alteration defense, that is “a fact-specific inquiry not appropriate for \ndetermination at the motion to dismiss stage.” Timothy B. v. Kinsley, No. 1:22-cv-1046, 2024 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 57276, at *47 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 29, 2024).  \nV.  Plaintiffs Sufficiently Plead Claims Under AACWA and North Carolina Social \nServices Law \n \nCounty  Defendants’  arguments  for  dismissing  Plaintiffs’  claims  under  the  Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Act (“AACWA”) (ECF No. 47 at 11-13, ECF No. 52 at 10-12) \nlargely mirror those made by DHHS Defendants (ECF No. 57 at 20-23), and they are wrong for \n  18\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 18 of 25\n\n \nthe same reasons.10 There are, however, a few additional arguments raised by County Defendants \nthat warrant a response. \nFirst, Gaston County argues that §§ 675(1) and 675(5) cannot create private rights because \nthey are located in the statute’s definitions section. This acontextual reading is wrong. § 671(a)(16) \nsets out the case plan requirement, § 675 defines a case plan. Reading one provision in isolation, \nas Defendants do, renders the other provision meaningless. Defendants’ interpretation violates \nbasic principles of statutory interpretation and should be rejected. See Cruz v. Garland, 101 F.4th \n361, 367 (4th Cir. 2024) (“Analyzing a statute requires more than reading the words of a provision \nin a vacuum, it requires reading the words in the context of the statute as a whole.”). \nSecond, County Defendants list several factors that purportedly weigh against private \nenforceability: the language of § 671(a) requires States to develop a plan in order to receive federal \nfunding, states must “substantially comply” to receive funding, and the Secretary can withhold \nfunding to enforce compliance with the statute. See ECF No. 47 at 11-13; ECF No. 52 at 10-12. \nAccording to County Defendants, these aspects of the statute indicate that it is focused on the \nregulated entity, not the beneficiaries of the regulation, that the statute is not focused on individual \nrights, and that there is an internal enforcement mechanism—evincing Congress’ intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement. Id. \nUnder County Defendants’ interpretation, no Spending Clause legislation could ever create \nprivate rights. This is precisely the logic that the Supreme Court rejected in Health & Hosp. Corp. \nof Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 177, 187-90 (2023) (emphasizing that requiring \nsubstantial compliance in exchange for federal funds does not evince Congress’ intent to preclude \n \n10 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference their discussion from their DHHS Opposition. See ECF No. \n92 at 15-18. \n  19\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 19 of 25\n\n \nprivate enforcement, and that the mere existence of an explicit enforcement mechanism with \nrespect to one statutory provision does not imply that Congress precluded §1983-enforcement of \nother statutory provisions). \nFinally, County Defendants’ argument does not contend with the individually-focused, \nmandatory, and specific language of the asserted provisions, choosing instead to analyze language \ncontained elsewhere in the statute. \nCounty Defendants likewise mount a superficial attack on Plaintiffs’ claim under Chapter \n7B of the North Carolina Social Services Law, N.C. G.S. § 7B-100 et seq., and corresponding \nregulations, 10A N.C.A.C. 70G.0501. Namely, they fail to address the implicit private right of \naction they create. See Sykes v. Health Network Sols., 372 N.C. 326, 338, 828 S.E.2d 467, 474 \n(2019) ( “[A] statute may authorize a private right of action either explicitly or implicitly[.]”).  \nAlthough the North Carolina Supreme Court “has not addressed the circumstances in which \na statute implicitly authorizes a private cause of action, the Court of Appeals has concluded that \n“an implicit right of a cause of action exists when a statute requires action from a party, and that \nparty has failed to comply with the statutory mandate.” United Daughters of the Confederacy v. \nCity of Winston-Salem, 383 N.C. 612, 637-38, 881 S.E.2d 32, 52 (2022) (quoting Sugar Creek \nCharter Sch., Inc. v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 195 N.C. App. 348, 355, 673 S.E.2d \n667 (2009)); see also Williams v. Alexander Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 128 N.C. App. 599, 604, 495 \nS.E.2d 406, 409 (1998) (implicit private right of action can be construed when “the statutory \nlanguage is ‘unambiguous, direct, imperative and mandatory.’”). When such implicit right of \naction exists, “the plaintiff has standing to vindicate the legal right so long as he is in the class of \npersons on whom the statute confers a cause of action.” United Daughters of the Confederacy, 383 \nN.C. at 637 (citation and alterations omitted).  \n  20\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 20 of 25\n\n \nApplying these principles, N.C. G.S. § 7B and 10A N.C.A.C. 70G.0501 create an implicit \nprivate right of action that confers standing on Plaintiffs, the foster children whose rights § 7B is \ndesigned  to  protect  and  vindicate.  10A  N.C.A.C.  70G.0501  contains  language  that  is \n“unambiguous, direct, imperative and mandatory.” Williams, 128 N.C. App. At 604. For example, \nthe regulation provides that “Social Workers or Case Managers serving children in family foster \nhomes shall serve no more than 15 children.” 10A N.C.A.C. 70G.0501(d). It outlines a strict \nsupervisor to social worker / case manager ratio and mandates that “[t]here shall be one additional \nsupervisor for every one to five additional social workers or case managers.” Id. § 70G.0501(e). \nAnd it mandates that supervisors, social workers, and case managers “receive training in the areas \nof child development, permanency planning methodology, family systems and relationships, child \nsexual abuse, trauma-informed care, and the reasonable and prudent parent standard.”  Id. § \n70G.0501(f). Plaintiffs adequately allege that County Defendants violate these unambiguous, \ndirect, and imperative statutory mandates.  \nFurthermore, the purpose of N.C. G.S. § 7B is to protect and defend the rights of foster \nchildren. For example, § 7B-100 states that the statute’s purpose is “To provide procedures for the \nhearing of juvenile cases that assure fairness and equity and that protect the constitutional rights \nof juveniles and parents,” § 7B-100(1); “To provide for services for the protection of juveniles by \nmeans that respect both the right to family autonomy and the juveniles’ needs for safety, continuity, \nand permanence,” § 7B-100(3); “To provide standards for the removal, when necessary, of \njuveniles from their homes and for the return of juveniles to their homes consistent with preventing \nthe unnecessary or inappropriate separation of juveniles from their parents,” § 7B-100(4); and “To \nprovide  standards…for  ensuring  that  the  best  interests  of  the  juvenile  are  of  paramount \nconsideration…,” § 7B-100(5).  \n  21\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 94     Filed 01/08/25     Page 21 of 25\n\n \nVI.  County DSS Are Not Suable Entities \nHaving reviewed County Defendants’ authorities regarding whether county DSS are suable \nentities, Plaintiffs concede that Mecklenburg County Department of Social Services-Youth and \nFamily Services and Gaston County Department of Social Services can be dismissed. The illegal \nactions of those County agencies are attributable to, and not separate and apart from, the Counties \nthemselves and County Defendants may answer for them. See, e.g., Montgomery v. Johnston Cnty. \nDep’t of Soc. Servs., No. 5:23-CV-00041-FL, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131021, at *18 (E.D.N.C. \nJune 2, 2023) (“an action against a county agency which directly affects the rights of the county is \nin fact an action against the county.” (citation omitted)).   \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis court should dismiss County Defendants’ motions to dismiss. \n \nRespectfully submitted, this the 8th day of January, 2025. \n/s/ Christopher J.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA \nCHARLOTTE DIVISION \nCase No. 3:24-CV-783-FDW-DCK \nJameson C., minor, by next friend STEVEN   \nBOLCH; et. al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n \nv.   RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION \nTO PRELIMINARY HEARING \nROY COOPER in his official capacity as the \nREQUESTS \nGovernor of North Carolina, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nBottom Line Up Front \nEach Defendant has asked that this Court hold a preliminary hearing on their \nMotions to Dismiss and toll discovery pending a decision on those motions.  While \nPlaintiffs do not oppose oral argument on the Motions to Dismiss, they do oppose any \ndelay in discovery.  Defendants’ jurisdictional arguments are thin and the immunity \ndefense is essentially finger-pointing between the counties and state officials. None \nof Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) or (2) arguments will dispose of this entire case, given \nthat many claims would remain and Plaintiffs likely could cure the alleged defects. \nTherefore, this Court should not toll discovery.  \nARGUMENT \nThis Court’s Initial  Scheduling Order notes that jurisdictional motions to \ndismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2) warrant preliminary decisions prior \nto the commencement of discovery.  (Initial Scheduling Order, III.c.i.).  However, \nmotions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or join a necessary party will not receive \n4927-8910-7209 v.1 \nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 75     Filed 12/20/24     Page 1 of 5\n\nsuch an automatic tolling of discovery.  (ISO, III.c.ii.). Instead, a Defendant must \nrequest that relief.  (Id.)  Each Defendant requests that early decision and pause of \ndiscovery here.  (See D.E. 48, 58, 59, 69).  \n  Both county Defendants site to Purvis v. Pitt Cnty. Sch., No. 4:12-CV-00054, \n2013 WL 3778950, at *1 (E.D.N.C. July 18, 2013).  But unlike our circumstance here, \nMagistrate Judge Webb was ruling upon a request for a protective order made \npursuant to Rule 26(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure in a case brought by a pro se \nplaintiff.  Plaintiffs here certainly intend to respond in opposition to the Motions to \nDismiss and not let the time run out for discovery planning.   \n  Further the county Defendants basis for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \nrelates to the status of the next friends of the Plaintiffs.  These motions are certainly \nnot suggesting that Plaintiffs have brought their civil rights action in the wrong court, \nbut instead that the next friend may, for some reason, be improper.  Plaintiffs will \naddress why these concerns are meritless in their response to the Motions to Dismiss, \nbut these defenses are not of the nature that would preclude discovery.  For instance, \nthe Amended Complaint states that Jameson C’s next friend is a former foster parent \nwho wanted to adopt him, (D.E. 37, ¶ 19), and for whom caseworkers followed up with \non how to handle Jameson after Jameson left the next friend’s home (Id. ¶ 24). \nEven if Defendants hit the mark on noting that Plaintiffs failed to sufficiently \nallege standing, “[a] dismissal for lack of standing—or any other defect in subject \nmatter  jurisdiction—must  be  one  without  prejudice,  because  a  court  that  lacks \njurisdiction has no power to adjudicate and dispose of a claim on the merits.” S. Walk \n  2\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 75     Filed 12/20/24     Page 2 of 5\n\nat Broadlands Homeowner's Ass'n v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, \n185  (4th  Cir.  2013).    Should  the  Court  find  any  merit  to  Defendants’  standing \narguments, Plaintiffs certainly intend to fix any issues and be ready proceed with \nnew next friends; thus, the foreclosure of discovery is not cleanly on the table here. \nThe  state  Defendants  argue  that  Plaintiffs  have  not  adequately  plead \nthemselves into the Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), exception to Eleventh \nAmendment Immunity, but that is in part based on a theory that the named directors \nare not responsible for enforcing constitutional requirements or federal law; that, the \nstate  Defendants  argue,  is  the  county  Defendants’  responsibility.    The  county \nDefendants, of course, note that the child welfare system is governed by the State. \n(See, e.g., D.E. 47, pp.5-6). Thus, these are not purely legal issues, and discovery, not \ndismissal, will illuminate whether this finger pointing in the context of immunity has \na real basis or not.  \nPlaintiffs understand that Defendants believe they are each not responsible \nfor the status of the child welfare system as a whole and in each of their counties.  \nMotions to Dismiss for failure to state a claim should certainly be deferred so that \ndiscovery can illuminate which among them has the responsibility to follow the law \nand affect the change that is necessary for these children in Defendants’ care.   \nRespectfully submitted, this the 20th of December, 2024. \n/s/ Christopher J.

North Carolina’s foster care system has been operating in a state of crisis for years. \nThe foster care population is increasing while foster home capacity decreases. Children are placed \ninto institutions at twice the national average, are shuttled between placements with disturbing \nfrequency, and do not receive adequate services or necessary medical treatment or education. \nCaseworkers are not receiving adequate training or support, they cannot manage the crushing \ncaseloads, morale is low, and turnover is outpacing recruitment. State leadership predicted, \ncorrectly, that this crisis would invite “a massive class action lawsuit.” \n2.  When the State takes a child into custody, it becomes responsible for the child’s \nsafety and wellbeing. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) \nand the 100 county departments of social services (“County DSS”) share responsibility for North \nCarolina’s foster children, and they share responsibility for the State’s continuous and systematic \nfailure to protect and provide for North Carolina’s foster children. For over a decade, DHHS has \nignored numerous warnings that its failure to lead and supervise county departments of social \nservices (“county DSS” or “DSS”) threatens the safety and wellbeing of foster children, and its \nongoing failure to supervise and support county DSS places foster children across the state at \nsubstantial  risk  of  harm.  And  County  Defendants—Mecklenburg  County,  Mecklenburg \nDepartment of Social Services-Youth and Family Services (Mecklenburg DSS-YFS), Gaston \nCounty, Gaston Department of Social Services (Gaston DSS), Davidson County, Davidson County \nDepartment of Social Services (Davidson DSS), Harnett County, Harnett County Department of \nSocial  Services  (Harnett  DSS),  Randolph  County,  Randolph  County  Department  of  Social \nServices  (Randolph  DSS),  Rockingham  County,  Rockingham  County Department  of  Social \nServices (Rockingham DSS), Johnston County, Johnston County Department of Social Services \n  2\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 2 of 99\n\n \n(Johnston DSS)—have failed to provide timely and appropriate treatment, to place children in safe \nand appropriate foster homes, to thoroughly investigate allegations of maltreatment in care, and to \nrecruit necessary and appropriate foster homes. \n3.   The Defendants’ ongoing failures place foster children at significant risk of serious \nharm in violation of their rights under federal law and the U.S. Constitution. \n4.  According to Kody Kinsley, the Secretary of DHHS, “[i]n any given week, dozens \nof children in foster care are living in emergency departments and child welfare offices. And \namong the children who struggle to find an appropriate placement that have been referred to the \ndepartment for additional help and coordination, a quarter of these children have been moved fifty \ntimes or more.” DHHS’s placement deficit is compounded by its services deficit. More than 60% \nof counties “have zero children or adolescent psychiatrist[s].” \n5.  DHHS has confirmed these observations: “[e]ach week, dozens of children with \ncomplex  behavioral  health  needs  require  immediate  protection  in  a  safe  and  supportive \nenvironment that can meet their physical and mental health care needs. The number of children \nwith these needs far exceeds the spaces and services available to keep them safe, help them \novercome crisis and reunite them with family and community. As a result, they can be found \nsleeping in hospital emergency rooms, in county departments of social services offices or local \nhotel  rooms.  ‘Living’  in  these  inappropriate  settings  compounds  the  trauma  that  children \nexperience during separation from their families and natural support systems. The longer children \nare separated from their families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and they run a \nhigher  risk  of  experiencing  poor  health  and  social  outcomes,  including  homelessness  and \ninvolvement with the justice system.” \n  3\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 3 of 99\n\n \n6.  Secretary  Kinsley  has  also  highlighted  North  Carolina’s  crisis-level  staffing \nproblems. DHHS’s 28% vacancy rate “has doubled since COVID,” 25% of counties have turnover \nrates exceeding 40%, “and high turnover is linked to longer stays in foster care.” The 2020-2024 \nChild and Family Services Plan noted that “Child welfare staff feel overwhelmed, unable to \ncomplete the work they are assigned, and struggling to manage a work-life balance.” \n7.  The named plaintiffs—Jameson C. (Gaston County); Megan S. and Chloe S. \n(Johnston County); Annie W. (Mecklenburg County); Justin B. (Mecklenburg County); Morgan \nG. (Mecklenburg County); Sara M., Leah M., and Harry M. (Alleghany County); Sylvia T. \n(Randolph County); Alice B. (Harnett County); Ava J. (Davidson County); Rene S. (Rockingham \nCounty)—are children in foster care in North Carolina. They bring this lawsuit as a civil rights \naction on behalf of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of county departments of \nsocial services “under the supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services.” G.S. § \n108A-1. They seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against the state agency, state officials, \nand named counties responsible for violating their rights under the United States Constitution and \nfederal law, which promise vulnerable children in state custody the right to be free from physical \nand psychological harm, and impose an affirmative obligation on the state to protect foster children \nagainst such harm. \n8.  Additionally, plaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against County \nDefendants for maintaining policies, practices, and customs that violate plaintiffs’ rights under \nboth federal and state law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a), and \n42 U.S.C. § 12133 and 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2). This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and \n  4\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 4 of 99\n\n \ninjunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  In addition, the court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim based on \nNorth Carolina law pursuant to 28 U.S.C 1367(a). \n10.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, and \nDefendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District.  \nPARTIES \nI.  Named Plaintiffs \n \nJameson C. \n \n11.  Jameson C. is an 8-year-old boy from Gaston County. He has been in foster care \nfor half his life. Jameson appears in this action through his next friend, Steven Bolch. Steven Bolch \nis employed as a pharmacy technician and previously worked at a clinic for behavioral health \nservices.  Steven  fostered  Jameson  for  18  months.  Steven  has  acquainted  himself  with  the \nallegations in the Complaint regarding Jameson’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his \nbest interests. \n12.  In May 2019, shortly after his 4th birthday, DSS removed Jameson from his home \nand placed him into foster care because his parents sexually, physically, and emotionally abused \nhim. \n13.  In the two years following his removal, from May 2019 to June 2021, DSS placed \nJameson in five different foster homes all over the state. He lived in Cherokee County, Lincoln \nCounty,  Mecklenburg  County,  and  Gaston  County,  and  moved  between  several  different \ncatchment areas including Vayo, Partners, and Cardinal. \n14.  After DSS removed Jameson from his family’s home, Jameson was diagnosed with \nPTSD due to severe sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, as well as ODD, and ADHD. In the \n  5\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 5 of 99\n\n \ntwo years following his removal, Jameson never received mental health treatment or specialized \ntherapy. Indeed, consistent treatment was impossible given the frequency and distance of his \nplacement changes. Instead, Jameson was placed on a medication regime that included at least \neight different medications, including psychotropic medications. \n15.  In June 2021, Jameson arrived at his 5th placement. The foster parent, a pharmacy \ntechnician  and  behavioral  health  specialist,  immediately  began  the  process  of  reducing \npolypharmacy and securing specialized mental health treatment. The foster parent petitioned DSS \nto reduce the medication regimen and successfully discontinued the use of psychotropic drugs. To \naddress the untreated PTSD, the foster parent secured mental health therapy services for Jameson. \nAnd to address the untreated sexual trauma, the foster parent entered Jameson into a specialized \nsexually problematic behavioral therapy program through Duke University. DSS did not assist in \nobtaining any of these services.  \n16.  Jameson’s  medical  treatment  was  inconsistent  because  his  parents  refused  to \nprovide consent for treatment or could not be reached to obtain consent, and DSS did not make \nreasonable efforts to obtain consent or otherwise ensure that Jameson received necessary medical \ntreatment. When COVID vaccines were approved for children, the parents refused to consent to \nvaccination. When DSS was unable to contact the parents to obtain consent to administer a \ndifferent brand of ADHD medication, Jameson went without his medication. \n17.  During his first six months in this placement, Jameson was required to visit his \nparents, alternating between weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly visits. After each visit, Jameson \nengaged in problematic sexualized behaviors. The foster parent tracked these behaviors and shared \nthe information with Jameson’s caseworker, but the visitations continued. \n  6\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 6 of 99\n\n \n18.  During a hearing in December 2021, Jameson’s parents requested that monthly \nvisits be changed to weekly visits. DSS knew that Jameson’s sexually problematic behaviors were \ntriggered when he visited his parents, his sexual abusers, but despite this knowledge, DSS \nrecommended bi-weekly visitation. \n19.  After nearly 32 months in foster care, long past the federal requirement, DSS still \nhad not filed to terminate Jameson’s parents’ parental rights. The foster parents expressed an \ninterest in adopting Jameson, but DSS said that it had no plans to file for a termination of parental \nrights. DSS explained that it would not file TPR for Jameson because DSS policy prohibited TPR \nfor only one sibling, and Jameson’s older brother was not in an adoptive placement and did not at \nthat time have any prospects of an adoptive placement.  DSS, however, did not point to any specific \npolicy that prevented a younger sibling from being adopted where their older sibling was not in an \nadoptive home.  \n20.  In the months following the hearing, Jameson had bi-weekly visits with his parents, \nand Jameson’s sexual behaviors worsened. He perpetrated sexual acts on children at daycare and \nat school, on the foster parents’ young nephews, and against animals. \n21.  Jameson’s case was not well managed as Jameson’s caseworker was managing \napproximately 20 cases and even more individual children, and was attempting to manage these \ncases without a reliable case management system. Coming from South Carolina child welfare \nservices, where she utilized an electronic case management system, the caseworker relayed that \nshe was surprised and distressed that DSS was operating under a paper-based system. Case files \nwere stashed in cabinet drawers: with files for 18 children stuffed into one drawer; Jameson’s case, \nlengthier and more complicated, occupied another drawer. The caseworker was unable to keep up \nwith all the paperwork and documentation in DSS’s archaic system. \n  7\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 7 of 99\n\n \n22.  The foster parents had learned to manage Jameson’s behaviors and implement \nsafety plans to prevent problematic sexual behaviors. But the specialized treatment behavior \nmanagement was only so effective after the two years of untreated trauma. Around June 2022, \nJameson’s sexualized behavior was directed to the foster parents, and they felt that it was no longer \nin Jameson’s best interests to remain in their home. \n23.  The foster parents requested that DSS remove Jameson and provided 30 days \nnotice. DSS couldn’t find a placement for Jameson, so the foster parents agreed to extend the \nplacement. It took approximately 120 days for DSS to find a new placement for Jameson. \n24.  Around October 2022, DSS placed Jameson with an experienced foster parent in \nCharlotte, NC. The new foster parent called the former foster parents multiple times per week \nseeking advice on how to manage Jameson’s worsening behaviors. Jameson’s caseworker often \ncalled the former foster parents seeking information about Jameson’s medication regimen. Unable \nto control his behaviors, Jameson was again placed on psychotropic drugs, including Risperidone. \nJameson was 7 years old.  \n25.  As a result of Jameson’s new placement, Jameson lost his relationship with his \ntherapist with whom he had finally developed a trusting relationship. The loss of this important \nrelationship further contributed to Jameson’s instability. \n26.  Jameson has changed placements several times since then and is now in his eighth \nplacement. After four years in state custody, DSS still has not filed to terminate parental rights and \nJameson’s permanency plan continues to remain uncertain. \n27.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Jameson has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \n  8\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 8 of 99\n\n \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Jameson’s \ncase, and not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nJameson’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Without relief, Jameson’s condition \nwill continue to suffer from placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed \npermanency. \nMegan S. and Chloe S. \n28.  Megan, seven years old, and her sister Chloe, five years old, are from Johnston \nCounty. Megan and Chloe appear in this action through their next friend, Daria Barazandeh. Daria \nBarazandeh began fostering children in North Carolina in 2012. Having spent over a decade as a \nfoster parent, adoptive parent, and foster parent advocate, Daria is familiar with North Carolina’s \nfoster care system. Daria has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nMegan and Chloe’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to their best interests. \n29.  Megan and Chloe were taken into custody on or about September 2019 based on \nallegations of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Megan was three and Chloe was less than \na year old. \n30.  Megan has been diagnosed with various disabilities, including ADHD, autism, \nreactive  attachment  disorder,  and  oppositional  defiant  disorder.  She  has  been  on  several \nprescription medications, including Zoloft, Prozac, Adderall, Abilify, Focalin, and Catapres. Both \nchildren show signs of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and/or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, including \nsensory sensitivities, but DSS has not yet had them diagnosed. Additionally, the girls suffer from \nother physical conditions attributable to prenatal exposure to toxins. \n31.  DSS first placed the children with a family friend. But because DSS did not provide \nthe appropriate supports, the placement disrupted after one month. \n  9\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 9 of 99\n\n \n32.  DSS then placed the children with Ms. O., a foster parent. During this time, DSS \nfailed to secure therapy for the children. Ms. O had to secure services on her own. \n33.  Ms. O was willing to be a guardian for Megan and Chloe, and the girls’ parents \nagreed to this. DSS had been working on a plan to terminate the parental rights of Megan and \nChloe’s parents so that Ms. O. could adopt them. But suddenly, after two years in the home of Ms. \nO, DSS removed the children without explanation, and without another adoptive home. DSS \nthreatened to deny Ms. O and the children an opportunity to say goodbye if Ms. O objected to the \nremoval. DSS gave the girls a few minutes to pack and say goodbye.  \n34.  After DSS removed Megan and Chloe from Ms. O’s home, DSS cycled the girls \nbetween seven different foster homes. Due to the untreated trauma and high frequency placements, \nMegan’s mental health deteriorated and her behavioral issues worsened, often manifesting in angry \noutbursts. Without adequate support from DSS, the placements disrupted. Megan struggled to bond \nwith the various foster parents. \n35.  Finally, a foster parent asked DSS to remove Megan and leave Chloe. DSS agreed \nto separate the girls. Megan’s behavior worsened when she heard the news. DSS placed Megan in \na residential treatment facility in and around August 2023. DSS did not tell Megan’s parents where \nshe was placed even though the case plan goal is still reunification and DSS has not moved to \nterminate parental rights.  \n36.  Although Megan was required under North Carolina law to be enrolled in school, \nDSS had not done so. Because the residential treatment facility in which she was placed did not \nhave educational programing, Megan was sent to the Johnston DSS office during the day. \n37.  On or about October 4, 2023, Johnston DSS, struggling with staffing vacancies, left \nMegan unsupervised in a DSS office in the same room with a 17-year-old boy, and the boy sexually \n  10\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 10 of 99\n\n \nassaulted Megan. DSS sent Megan to the emergency room for evaluation and immediately placed \nher back in the residential treatment facility. The perpetrator has since been charged with first \ndegree statutory assault. Upon information and belief, Megan has not received any specialized \ntreatment or therapeutic support to cope with the assault. \n38.  Megan has since been removed from residential treatment and placed in a foster \nhome. She remains separated from her sister, Chloe. \n39.  Although the girls have been in custody for over two years, DSS still has not filed \na petition to terminate parental rights. Because DSS has not made any significant steps towards \neither reunification or adoption for the children, the girls are  unlikely to reunite or obtain \npermanency in the near future. \n40.  The court ordered monthly visitations with the parents, but the girls’ caseworker \nhas denied the parents visitation since at least October 2023. Upon information and belief, DSS \nhas not moved to modify the court order; the caseworker has simply refused to comply with it. \n41.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Megan and Chloe have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. If Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged \nin reasonable case planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable \ninformation  system,  not  acted  in  disregard  of  reasonable  professional  standards  as  to  the \nmanagement of Megan and Chloe’s case, and not acted with deliberate indifference to their legal \nrights, Defendants may have prevented Megan and Chloe’s condition from deteriorating while in \nstate custody. Without relief, Megan and Chloe will continue to suffer from placement instability, \nlack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \n  11\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 11 of 99\n\n \n \nAnnie W. \n \n42.  Annie is a thirteen-year-old girl from Mecklenburg County. She has been in foster \ncare since she was five years old. Annie appears in this action through her next friend, Veronika \nS. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender based in Charlotte, NC. Having spent \nnearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is familiar with North Carolina’s foster \ncare system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding \nAnnie’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to her best interests. \n43.  Mecklenburg DSS took Annie into custody in 2015 based on a finding of neglect.  \nAlthough her parents’ parental rights were terminated in 2018, DSS has not placed her in an \nadoptive home before or since that time. \n44.  Annie has severe developmental delays and acute mental health issues. She has an \nextensive history of mental health treatment and has been hospitalized numerous times since she \nwas taken into DSS custody. She has also been diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. She is on \nthree different  psychotropic  medications,  including  one  to  treat  her  ADHD  and  two  mood \nstabilizers. \n45.  Despite her developmental delays, Annie was not evaluated and did not receive \nearly intervention services. She has been enrolled in special education programs since 2017. \n46.  Since DSS took Annie into custody, DSS has placed her in at least 22 foster \nplacements, including three different PRTFs. Because these placements were ill-prepared to \nsupport Annie’s mental health needs, the placements quickly disrupted, and Annie’s condition \nrapidly deteriorated. Annie cycled in and out of hospitals, where she stayed for months at a time \nbecause DSS could find no other placement. In July 2019, DSS removed Annie from a hospital \nsetting and placed her in an emergency placement with a new family. Annie went back to the \n  12\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 12 of 99\n\n \nhospital after only one day in her new placement. In September 2020, after yet another placement \ndisrupted, Annie was again admitted to a hospital where she remained for five months. \n47.  DSS placed Annie in Levine Children’s Hospital in October 2023. Annie remained \nthere for six months. Because Levine Children’s Hospital is not a mental health treatment facility, \nAnnie did not receive the mental health treatment necessary to ameliorate her risk of further \ndeterioration and instituionalization. Nor did Annie receive appropriate eduational services while \nplaced in Levine Children’s Hospital, including including special education programs needed to \naddress Annie’s severe developmental delays. \n48.  Following her extended stay at Levine Children’s Hospital, Annie was transferred \nto a non-institutional placement and enrolled in school. \n49.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Annie has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Annie’s case, \nand not acted with deliberate indifference to her legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nAnnie’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Annie remains at risk of deterioration \ndue to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nJustin B. \n50.  Justin is a 16-year-old boy from Mecklenburg County. Justin appears in this action \nthrough his next friend, Veronika S. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender based \nin Charlotte, NC. Having spent nearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is familiar \n  13\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 13 of 99\n\n \nwith North Carolina’s foster care system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the allegations in \nthe Complaint regarding Justin’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his best interests. \n51.  Mecklenburg DSS took Justin into custody in 2011 due to domestic abuse. \n52.  DSS initially placed Justin with his maternal grandmother. DSS knew that Justin’s \nmother had been removed from Justin’s grandmother based on allegations of abuse. Justin \nremained in his grandmother’s home from 2011 to 2016. During that time, Justin was sexually \nabused. \n53.  In 2016, DSS removed Justin and his siblings from his grandmother. \n54.  Justin suffers from PTSD as a result of the sexual abuse. And his condition \nworsened because his did not receive timely and appropriate treatment for his trauma. \n55.  Since 2016, DSS has placed Justin in over 18 placements, including a psychiatric \nresidential treatment facility (Alexander Youth Network, Greensboro) and a group home (Miracle \nHouses) where Justin (then 13 years old) resided with older youth. DSS also placed Justin in a \nseries of emergency placements, emergency therapeutic-like placements, and therapeutic foster \nhomes. Justin lived with a sibling in only one of these placements.  \n56.  DSS also placed Justin in many rapid response homes, including homes operated \nby Unique Caring Foundation (“UCF”). Mecklenburg DSS contracts with UCF to provide short-\nterm (30 day) foster home placements. These placements are considered equivalent to therapeutic \nfoster homes, but, unlike therapeutic foster homes, UCF is paid by DSS under contract rather than \nthrough Medicaid. Justin was placed in a rapid response home for more than a year. He did not \nreceive therapeutic services or education services. During this time, his mental and emotional \nhealth deteriorated, and his educational growth was stunted. \n  14\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 14 of 99\n\n \n57.  Because of the high frequency of placement changes, Justin was transferred to over \n10 different schools. \n58.  At least 5 different case workers have been assigned to Justin’s case. Caseworker \nturnover caused poor communication and case planning on Justin’s case.  \n59.  In 2023, DSS found an adoptive home for Justin. Initially, the prospective adoptive \nparents felt prepared to adopt Justin based on the information that DSS provided to them. But after \nlearning about Justin’s full history, the adoptive parents believed that they could not adequately \ncare for Justin and ended the adoption process. Justin was aware that the adoptive parents had \nrejected him. This caused even more trauma.  \n60.  Upon information and belief, Mecklenburg DSS routinely withholds information \nabout children from adoptive parents to persuade those parents to adopt foster children. But when \nthose parents learn about the child’s extensive needs (either before or after adoption), the adoption \ndisrupts. Mecklenburg DSS’s practice of withholding information from adoptive parents results in \ndisruptions that compound the child’s trauma and reduce the likelihood of future adoptions and \nplacements. \n61.  After the adoption process disrupted, DSS suddenly terminated Justin’s long-time \ntherapist, who specialized in trauma and sexual abuse, and with whom Justin had developed a \ntrusting relationship. \n62.  After his mental health treatment was disrupted, Justin struggled in an emergency \nplacement. At one point, staff at the provider day program called police and a mobile crisis unit. \nJustin was calm by the time they arrived, but he was transported to a hospital emergency room. \n63.  Justin  spent  Christmas  in  the  hospital  because  DSS  was  unable  to  locate  a \nplacement for Justin. Justin’s hospitalization was not medically necessary. While hospitalized, \n  15\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 15 of 99\n\n \nJustin was not receiving treatment for his mental health, was not attending school, and was not \nmoving towards permanency. \n64.  DSS failed to monitor Justin while he was in the hospital. At one point, DSS did \nnot know what hospital Justin was in. \n65.  Mecklenburg DSS routinely transports foster children to local hospitals with the \nexpectation that those children will remain at the hospital on a “social hold” until an appropriate \nplacement can  be found. While in the hospital, these children do not receive their regular \ntreatments and do not receive educational services. \n66.  Justin was discharged from the hospital on January 18, 2024 and placed in an \nemergency residential treatment program. Upon information and belief, there was no clinical \nrecommendation or certificate of need for Justin’s placement at a residential treatment facility. \nAlthough placement in these emergency residential treatment programs are not intended to exceed \n120 days, Justin has been there for seven months. He is still there. \n67.  Justin’s mother faces mental health challenges, but DSS failed to secure appropriate \nservices for Justin’s mother. Because DSS did not attempt efforts at reunification, Justin’s parents’ \nparental rights were terminated. Although Justin has a permanency plan of adoption, DSS has not \nplaced him in an adoptive home and is not actively seeking an adoptive home. \n68.  After nearly a decade in custody with no prospect of permanency, Justin’s mother \nhas expressed a renewed interest in the case, and the judge has reconsidered the possibility of \nreunification. \n69.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Justin has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \n  16\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 16 of 99\n\n \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Justin’s case, \nand not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nJustin’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody. Justin remains at risk of deterioration \ndue to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nMorgan G. \n \n70.  Morgan is a 15-year-old boy from Mecklenburg County. Morgan appears in this \naction through his next friend, Veronika S. Monteleone. Veronika Monteleone is a public defender \nbased in Charlotte, NC. Having spent nearly a decade representing children in court, Veronika is \nfamiliar with North Carolina’s foster care system. Veronika has acquainted herself with the \nallegations in the Complaint regarding Morgan’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to his \nbest interests. \n71.  Mecklenburg DSS removed Morgan and his siblings from their biological parents \nin 2014 due to repeated physical abuse and domestic violence. Morgan also exhibits signs of a \nhistory of sexual abuse. \n72.  Morgan  has  been  diagnosed  with  intellectual  disability,  attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, \noppositional  defiant  disorder,  and  other  unspecified  trauma  and  stressor-related  disorders. \nAlthough his care coordinators have suspected that he is on the autism spectrum, Morgan has never \nbeen tested for autism. \n73.  Morgan’s experience in DSS custody has been marked by extreme instability. DSS \nhas changed his placement at least 30 times. These repeated placement changes have caused \nsignificant disruption to his education and social services. The placement changes have also led to \n  17\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 17 of 99\n\n \na severe deterioration in his mental and emotional state, exacerbating underlying emotional and \nbehavioral issues, and creating a vicious cycle of crisis, disruption, and further instability.    \n74.  Within his first year in DSS custody, from April 2014 to May 2015, Morgan \nexperienced 11 placement changes alone. \n75.  DSS placed Morgan in a therapeutic foster home in May 2015 and he remained \nthere until March 2019. The placement disrupted due to Morgan’s behavioral issues and DSS’s \nfailure to provide sufficient services to Morgan or support to his foster parents. DSS failed to make \nreasonable attempts to place Morgan in a home where he could live for substantial period of time.  \n76.  DSS placed Morgan in 18 placement changes between March 2019 and February \n2020, with many placements lasting no more than a few days. \n77.  These constant placement changes caused Morgan to change elementary schools \napproximately six different times. Given his significant intellectual disability and other mental and \nemotional deficits, the lack of consistency in his education has further destabilized Morgan. Even \nworse, Morgan has gone years without any educational instruction at all.  \n78.   From August 2019 to February 2020, Morgan was not enrolled in school.  Prior to \nAugust 2019, Morgan was enrolled in a school in Mecklenburg County. After his placement \ndisrupted in August 2019, he was sent to another placement in Gaston County and referred to a \nday treatment facility there. DSS failed to reenroll Morgan in a school in Gaston County. \n79.  The day treatment facility did not have an Individualized Education Program \n(“IEP”) for Morgan. Morgan did not have an IEP because he was not enrolled in any school. While \nsome children in day treatment received instructional materials from their schools, Morgan was \ngiven crossword puzzles. When he was not doing crossword puzzles, he would sleep or go the \ngym. \n  18\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 18 of 99\n\n \n80.  Morgan also faced physical and emotional abuse in the foster home where DSS \nplaced him in August 2019. Specifically, Morgan’s then-foster parent would send him to day \ntreatment in a diaper even though he was 12 years old. Morgan had been wearing a diaper at night \nfor anuresis and to prevent him from digging into his rectum (a possible indication of sexual trauma \nthat no one has ever fully explored). Morgan’s foster parent would not pack any additional diapers \nfor Morgan at the facility, and stated that Morgan needed to sit in his soiled diaper to teach him a \nlesson because he “knew better.” \n81.  Morgan also complained that this foster parent subjected him to various forms of \npunishment, including hitting him and making him sit in the corner by himself. Although DSS \nremoved Morgan after he reported the abuse, this maltreatment further traumatized Morgan.    \n82.  At the time, DSS did not have any available appropriate placements for Morgan in \nNorth Carolina. So in February 2020, DSS sent Morgan to an out-of-state PRTF in South Carolina. \nMorgan’s social worker recommended against sending Morgan to a PRTF because he did not meet \nthe criteria for psychiatric residential treatment. \n83.  DSS did not provide the out-of-state PRTF with a copy of Morgan’s IEP and, thus, \ndid not implement it. During this period, DSS also did not provide the PRTF with a comprehensive \nsummary of Morgan’s mental health needs or of his educational history. \n84.  Morgan remained at the PRTF until April 2022. Morgan remained at the PRTF \nbecause DSS could not find a placement for him in North Carolina, not because there was a clinical \nrecommendation for placement in a PRTF. \n85.  In or around April 2022, Morgan was transferred to a new placement in North \nCarolina – an alternative family living home (“AFL”) or a home licensed to provide services to \n  19\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 19 of 99\n\n \nchildren with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Although this was a better placement \nsetting for Morgan than the out-of-state PRTF, his educational needs continued to be neglected. \n86.  Upon his return, Morgan was enrolled in an alternative school setting for children \nwho had been suspended or expelled from the regular school system due to behavioral issues. The \nenvironment was not conducive to supporting children with intellectual disabilities like Morgan, \nand DSS failed to provide Morgan with any support to aid this transition back to school. Morgan \nhad spent many years without any formal education and was provided with no additional support \nto prepare him to return to school. Unsurprisingly, the transition to a more traditional educational \nenvironment was a failure and he only attended for a short time before he experienced another \ncrisis.  \n87.  Within weeks of his placement transfer, Morgan had an emotional outburst and got \ninto an altercation with his new foster parent. Morgan’s behavioral outburst escalated when he hurt \nhis foster parent’s dog and threatened to hurt her. As a result, he was transported to the Emergency \nRoom at Davis Regional Medical Center in Statesville. The hospital was not a psychiatric facility, \nnor did it have a children’s unit. It was wholly unequipped to address Morgan’s needs. \n88.  On multiple occasions, the hospital determined that it was no longer medically \nnecessary for Morgan to remain in the hospital. Hospital staff contacted DSS, but DSS refused to \npick up Morgan because DSS had no other placement for him. Morgan languished in the hospital \nfor weeks, without adequate care or support, and without any effort to continue his educational \ninstruction. \n89.  Due to the lack of adequate care and support, Morgan’s behavior continued to \nescalate, leading him to be involuntarily committed and prolonging his hospital admission.  \n  20\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 20 of 99\n\n \n90.  The hospital was not a safe placement for Morgan. Morgan is prone to running \naway when he is emotionally disturbed. But because the hospital is not a locked facility and does \nnot  specialize  in  children  with  behavioral  disorders.  Withough  locked  doors  or  continuous \nsupervision, Morgan ran away from the hospital multiple times, sometimes several times in a \nsingle day. \n91.  Morgan’s flights from the hospital brought him into grave danger. On one occasion, \nhe ran barefoot across an interstate highway, risking collision with oncoming traffic, and suffering \nabrasions all over his feet. \n92.  On another occasion, he ran away and jumped into a stranger’s car. The stranger \neventually returned Morgan to the hospital. \n93.  Morgan’s lack of adequate supervision or care at the hospital and his frequent \nabscondments led to numerous run-ins with law enforcement. The hospital regularly called the \npolice because of Morgan’s outbursts and the police often used force to restrain him. On one \noccasion, several officers immobilized Morgan in the middle of the street by sitting on his body.  \n94.  Morgan’s condition deteriorated so significantly in the hospital that members of his \ncare team perceived that if he remained in the hospital any longer, he was at risk of serious harm \nor  even  death.  After  nearly  two-weeks  in  the  hospital,  an  intervention  led  by  hospital \nadministrators caused DSS to remove Morgan from the hospital and place him in another AFL.  \n95.  Morgan remained in the AFL for approximately one year. Due to his foster parent’s \npersonal circumstances, Morgan was moved to another AFL in the summer of 2023. Due to years \nof educational neglect, Morgan is well below grade level. Years of instability and emotional \nneglect, as well as his recent traumatic hospital admission, have also taken their toll, and he \ncontinues to be at risk of a placement disruption due to his unmet behavioral and emotional needs. \n  21\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 21 of 99\n\n \nMorgan is only a few years away of aging out of the foster care system and DSS has no made plans \nfor him to obtain permanency.  \n96.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Morgan has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Morgan’s \ncase, and not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nMorgan’s  condition  from  deteriorating  while  in  state  custody.  Morgan  remains  at  risk  of \ndeterioration due to placement instability, lack of appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nSara M., Leah M., and Harry M. \n97.  Sara, Leah, and Harry are siblings from Alleghany County. They appear in this \naction through next friend, Kari Danforth. Kari adopted one child from out of state and fostered \nten children in North Carolina. She was selected as “Foster Parent of the Year” by Children’s \nHome Society. Kari is very familiar with North Carolina’s foster care system. She has acquainted \nherself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding Sara, Leah, and Harry’s experiences in \nfoster care and is dedicated to their best interests. \n98.  DSS took the siblings into custody in February 2022 due to their parents’ substance \nabuse and domestic abuse problems. Sara was seven years old, Leah was six, and Harry was three. \n99.  The siblings were placed in Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home.  \n100.  Upon information and belief, DSS did not make reasonable efforts to contact \nrelatives or other kin with whom the children could be placed before sending them to the group \nhome. DSS ignored prior communications with the children’s maternal grandmother, Mrs. B., who \n  22\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 22 of 99\n\n \npreviously had notified DSS that she would be able to take the children in the event that a removal \noccurred. No one from DSS contacted Mrs. B after the removal. \n101.  Mrs. B contacted DSS immediately after learning of the children’s removal. She \nrequested to speak to and visit the children. She stated that she and her husband had been in \nfrequent contact with the children up until February and it was important for the children to know \nthat “Grampa and Nana are still available.” DSS responded, “We typically do not approve visits \nor telephone calls with grandparents.” \n102.  Mrs.  B  made  several  inquires:  why  DSS  was  denying  contact  with  her \ngrandchildren, why the children were placed at Ebenezer and whether they were receiving any \nspecific counseling or care there, why she was not immediately contacted upon removal. She \nreceived no response to these inquiries. After a month of repeated attempts, she was granted \ncontact with her grandchildren. \n103.  At a permanency hearing, the court ruled that the three children could reside with \ntheir grandparents. But DSS kept the children at Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home until they \ncompleted the school year. \n104.  When Mrs. B picked up the children from the group home, DSS was not present to \ndiscuss the children’s permanency status, their experience at the group home, or their current \nmental and emotional state. She was informed that the children would be held back a year \nacademically.  \n105.  The children lived with Mrs. B and her husband until May 2023. They began the \nprocess of becoming licensed as a kinship placement. The children’s permanency plan was \nchanged from reunification to guardianship. The children’s biological parents refused to sign \n  23\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 23 of 99\n\n \nguardianship forms, and did not undergo required drug testing or domestic violence assessments. \nInstead, they appealed the children’s removal. \n106.  Under the guardianship plan, DSS required the grandparents to supervise visitations \nwith the children’s biological parents. After every visitation, the children were emotionally \ndisturbed and experienced repercussive behavioral issues. Mrs. B witnessed how these visitations \nwere  traumatizing  to  the  children  and  requested  that  DSS  cease  them.  DSS  refused.  The \ngrandparents declined to become guardians. \n107.  Shortly before the grandparents completed the foster care licensing process, DSS \nsuddently removed the children from their grandparents and placed them with their aunt and uncle. \n108.  The children lived with their aunt and uncle for five months. During that time, the \naunt and uncle also observed how distraught the children were following visitations with their \nbiological parents. They expressed an interest in adopting the children so that they could give them \na permanent home and terminate the visitations that caused them so much distress. DSS declined \nto pursue adoption. The caseworkers told them that the guardianship paperwork was already \nproceessed and that adoption would take too long. DSS did not indicate that guardianship was in \nthe best interest of the children. \n109.  At a court hearing, DSS informed the court that the parties had agreed that the \npermanency plan for the children was guardianship with the aunt and uncle. The possibility of \nadoption was not mentioned at all, nor were the concerns regarding parental visitations. The court \napproved the guardianship plan with the aunt and uncle. The court was never apprised of their \ndesire to adopt the children, nor of the issues with continuing contact with their biological parents, \n110.  After several months caring for the three siblings in addition to their three biological \nchildren, the aunt and uncle determined that they could no longer financially support Sara, Leah, \n  24\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 24 of 99\n\n \nand Harry without assistance. The aunt and uncle expressed that they were still willing to adopt \nthe children, but DSS said that adoption was no longer an option because the court approved \nguardianship. DSS also said that it lacked authority to pursue adoption as an alternative to \nguardianship. \n111.  In October 2023, DSS abruptly terminated the children’s placement with the aunt \nand uncle and moved them to the home of their paternal grandmother. \n112.  The  children  began  experiencing  problems  in  their  new  placement  almost \nimmediately. Whereas they previously lived in a stable, loving, and supportive environment, they \nwere exposed to violence and instability in their paternal grandmother’s home. The children’s half-\nbrother already resided in the home. He was troubled and prone to violence, and he bullied Sara. \nThe children’s father also had a history of domestic violence. Although there was a restraining \norder in place prohibiting contact with the children, their grandmother nevertheless allowed her \nson to visit the home due to his relationship with their half-brother. This further destabilized the \nchildren. \n113.  During conversations with the aunt and uncle, Sara complained of being bullied by \nher half-brother. She also stated that she did not want to live there and wanted to run away. \n114.  The children were permitted to visit Mrs. B during Christmas 2023. They were \nhappy to be reunited with their maternal grandparents and aunt and uncle. But their mental and \nemotional state had clearly deteriorated since they went to live with their paternal grandmother. \nWhen their visit was coming to an end, Sara threatened to run away or hurt herself if she was \nforced to return to her paternal grandmother’s home.  \n  25\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 25 of 99\n\n \n115.  In January 2024, DSS removed the children from their paternal grandmother’s \nhome and returned them to Ebenezer Christian Children’s Home. The children did not have any of \ntheir clothes or belongings from before being placed at the group home. \n116.  The children have remained in the group home ever since. DSS has not facilitated \ncontact with the maternal grandparents or aunt and uncle other than a court-ordered monthly 15-\nminute phone call. DSS said that they didn’t want the children to become more attached to the \nmaternal grandparents. \n117.  The maternal grandparents have expressed their desire to adopt the three children. \nThey have repeatedly asked for the children to come back to live with them in the interim while \nDSS works towards a permanency plan. DSS has refused these requests. DSS has kept these three \nchildren, all under the age of 10, in a congregate care facility despite the immediate availability of \na safe, stable, and loving kinship placement with their maternal grandparents. DSS has restricted \nthe children’s contact with their relatives despite the nurturing and supportive role that their \nmaternal grandparents and aunt and uncle have in their lives. \n118.  At a recent permanency hearing, when asked why the children were in a group \nhome rather than in kinship placements, DSS responded that the kids are happy at Ebenezer \nChristian Children’s Home, and that the children are “saved” and want to be baptized. The \nchildren’s parents do not support the apparent religious indoctrination the children are enduring at \nEbenezer Christian Children’s Home. \n119.  DSS has not plans to change placement. The next permanency hearing is scheduled \nfor January 2025. \n120.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Sara, Leah, and Harry have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. If Defendants had made \n  26\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 26 of 99\n\n \nreasonable professional judgments, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged \nin reasonable case planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable \ninformation  system,  not  acted  in  disregard  of  reasonable  professional  standards  as  to  the \nmanagement  of  their  case,  and  not  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  their  legal  rights, \nDefendants may have prevented Sara, Leah, and Harry from deteriorating while in state custody. \nWithout relief, Sara, Leah, and Harry will be at ongoing risk of placement instability, lack of \nappropriate services, delayed permanency, and religious indoctrination contrary to their parents’ \nwishes. \nSylvia T. \n121.  Sylvia T. is a 13-year-old girl from Randolph County. Sylvia appears in this action \nthrough her next friend, Anne Richey. Anne Richey is a registered nurse and licensed foster parent. \nAnne fostered Sylvia from September 2023 to March 2024. Ms. Richey has acquainted herself \nwith the allegations in the Complaint regarding Sylvia’s experience in foster care and is dedicated \nto her best interests.  \n122.  Sylvia was born in August 2011. In the following years, her mother and father were \nconvicted of child abuse. Shortly before Sylvia turned 8, her mother was again convicted of child \nabuse, and DSS placed Sylvia with her paternal grandmother.  \n123.  During the next four years in the grandmother’s home, Sylvia suffered severe \nemotional and physical abuse. As a form of punishment, the grandmother forced Sylvia to watch \nas she shot and burned Sylvia’s three dogs.  \n124.  After this incident of child abuse and animal cruelty, Randolph DSS removed \nSylvia. Sylvia disclosed additional abuse during the forensic interview.  \n  27\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 27 of 99\n\n \n125.  In September 2023, following Sylvia’s removal and after one night in an emergency \nplacement, DSS placed Sylvia in Ms. Richey’s home.   \n126.  Sylvia developed a strong bond with Ms. Richey and her family, and Ms. Richey \nbecame Sylvia’s most trusted advocate. \n127.  When Ms. Richey requested an assessment for an individualized education program \n(IEP) or 504 plan for Sylvia, DSS rejected the idea, noting that “Sylvia’s just choosing not to do \nthe work.”  \n128.  Sylvia had endured a lifetime of trauma and was in dire need of specialized medical \ntreatment. She suffered from anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, eating disorder, self-\nharm,  and  sleep  disturbances.  She  also  had  difficulty  concentrating  in  school,  completing \nassignments, planning, organizing, and studying. And her trauma made it difficult to form trusting \nrelationships with her peers and adults.  \n129.  Recognizing the need for treatment, Ms. Richey repeatedly requested that DSS \nsecure additional therapy services beyond the weekly therapy visits that she had arranged. DSS \ndid not do so.  \n130.  On March 29, Sylvia was admitted to in-patient treatment at the hospital due to self-\nharming behaviors and suicidal ideation. Anne visited her every day, and DSS encouraged \ncommunication between Ms. Richey and Sylvia.  \n131.  DSS requested that the hospital provide a recommendation for placement and the \nhospital declined to make any recommendation.  \n132.  Several days later, DSS transferred Sylvia to a crisis facility, Daymark, for a 30-\nday assessment. Sylvia did not want to remain at the facility. Upon information and belief, \nDaymark is intended to be a short-term stay facility where 30-day assessments are conducted, not \n  28\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 28 of 99\n\n \na long-term care facility. But Sylvia remained in the facility for over 60 days because DSS could \nnot find an appropriate placement. During this time, Sylvia was not receiving her regular therapy, \nand she was not receiving an education.  \n133.  Communication between Ms. Richey and Sylvia was suddenly and drastically \nreduced.  Sylvia was allowed to speak with Anne over the phone for 10 minutes each day. Soon \nafter, phone calls were reduced to three times per week. Two months after placement at the facility, \nwith no explanation, DSS terminated all communication between Sylvia and Ms. Richey. Ms. \nRichey was not permitted to visit Sylvia in the facility. Nor were Sylvia’s biological aunt and her \nuncle, who reached out to DSS multiple times to try to set up a visit. Sylvia’s only in-person \ncontacts outside of the facility were occasional visits with DSS and the Guardian Ad Litem. \n134.  Anne had contacted the school to inform them that Sylvia was hospitalized.  Weeks \nlater the school contacted Ms. Richey to check on Sylvia’s status. DSS had not communicated with \nthe school about Sylvia’s condition. DSS did not request accommodations to enable Sylvia to \ncontinue her education while at the facility.  \n135.  While at the facility, Sylvia was physically assaulted and sent to the hospital for a \nCT scan. Sylvia was physically assaulted again, but the facility did not seek medical attention for \nSylvia.  \n136.  DSS was searching for a therapeutic foster home. Knowing this, Ms. Richey \ncompleted training to obtain a therapeutic foster care license. Nevertheless, DSS refused to \nconsider returning Sylvia to Ms. Richey’s home.  \n137.  After two months at Daymark, DSS placed Sylvia in a therapeutic foster home in \nScotland County, her fourth placement in a year. At this placement, DSS failed to obtain therapy \n  29\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 29 of 99\n\n \nfor Sylvia.  In July 2024, DSS moved Sylvia to a therapeutic foster home in Cumberland County, \nher 5th placement. \n138.  DSS’s permanency goal is reunification. But DSS does not have a plan to safely \nreunify Sylvia with her parents. Sylvia is terrified of returning to her mother. She wishes to inform \nthe judge about her concerns, but DSS has not allowed her to attend the hearings or participate \nremotely.  \n139.  DSS has not shared with Sylvia a plan for her ongoing mental health care.  DSS has \nnot provided educational services for Sylvia from April 2024 to August 2024. \n140.  Sylvia had a court hearing on November 6, 2024. At that time, her Guardian Ad \nLitem stated that in October Sylvia had been placed back at the same Daymark facility where she \nhad been physically assaulted and was receiving no educational services. Sylvia is again receiving \nno educational services at the facility or her much needed trauma therapy.  \n141.  As was the case during her previous stay at Daymark, Sylvia also has not been \npermitted visitation from Anne. Sylvia’s biological aunt and uncle reached out to DSS multiple \ntimes to try to set up a visit, but they were not permitted to visit Sylvia either.  Sylvia’s only visits \nare from her DSS social worker and her Guardian Ad Litem. Her isolation and alienation from \neveryone  in  her  support  network  has  contributed  to  her  depression  and  exacerbated  her \npsychological and behavioral issues.  \n142.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Sylvia has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, emotional and psychological harm. If Defendants had exercised reasonable \nprofessional judgment, provided timely and appropriate medical treatment, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, equipped caseworkers with a reliable information system, \nnot acted in disregard of reasonable professional standards as to the management of Sylvia’s case, \n  30\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 30 of 99\n\n \nand not acted with deliberate indifference to her legal rights, Defendants may have prevented \nSylvia’s condition from deteriorating while in state custody.  \n143.  Sylvia remains at risk of continuing deterioration due to placement instability, lack \nof appropriate services, and delayed permanency. \nAva J. \n144.  Ava J. is an 8-year-old girl from Davidson County who has been in foster care for \ntwo years. Ava appears in this action through her next friend, Kayla DeWald. Kayla DeWald was \na foster parent for two years before she terminated her license. She fostered 12 children of all ages \nthrough Davidson County and she adopted two children. Kayla DeWald served as a respite \nplacement for Ava. Kayla DeWald has acquainted herself with the allegations in the Complaint \nregarding Ava’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to her best interests. \n145.  In November 2022, Ava and her two younger siblings (one 18 months old, the other \napproximately three years old) were removed from their home due to abuse by their biological \nparents.  \n146.  Ava also has two older siblings, who were removed from their parents’ custody at \nan earlier date. \n147.  In the two years that Ava has been in DSS custody, she has had three DSS \ncaseworkers. \n148.  Ava and her younger siblings were initially placed together in a foster home. Their \nbiological parents voluntarily relinquished their parental rights to the youngest sibling so that the \nfoster family could adopt him. \n149.  The foster family also wants to adopt Ava, and the biological parents wish to \nvoluntarily relinquish their parental rights so that the foster family can also adopt Ava; however, \n  31\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 31 of 99\n\n \nDSS removed Ava from the foster family’s custody in October 2023 and moved her to another \nfoster home. \n150.  When Ava went to her first foster family in November 2022, the foster parent \narranged  weekly  therapy  for  Ava.  Ava  was  diagnosed  with  Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder \n(“ODD”),  Attention  Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder  (“ADHD”),  and  Post-Traumatic  Stress \nDisorder (“PTSD”). \n151.  After several months, Ava had an altercation at the foster home and hit another \nfoster child. As a result of this one incident, DSS decided to increase her level of need from Level \nI to Level II. \n152.  On Sept. 25, 2023, Ava’s therapist wrote a letter recommending additional services \nthat would allow Ava to learn emotional regulation while maintaining the stability of the foster \nhome and remaining together with her siblings, instead of moving Ava to a Level II foster home. \nShe recommended twice weekly therapy, intensive in-home therapy services, and medication \nmanagement. \n153.  DSS  did  not  follow the therapist’s  recommendations  and  never  attempted  to \nimplement additional services at the home where Ava had lived with her siblings for 11 months. \nInstead, DSS told the therapist to recommend moving Ava to a Level II foster home. \n154.  The therapist responded that moving Ava to a Level II foster home was the best \noption “if [the recommended] resources were not going to be utilized.” (emphasis added). \n155.  In October 2023, DSS placed Ava in a Level II therapeutic foster home in Charlotte, \nNC, approximately an hour away from all four of her siblings, who have all been placed in or \nadopted by families in Davidson County. \n  32\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 32 of 99\n\n \n156.  At the time DSS moved Ava, DSS claimed that they had already arranged for a \ntherapist and a specialist at the new home. However, as of January 2024, three months after the \nmove, DSS still did not have therapy for Ava at the new home. \n157.  Though DSS maintained sibling visits at first, DSS has not brought Ava to visit her \nsiblings since July 2024.  \n158.  DSS has now forbidden communication between Ava’s current foster parents and \nformer foster parents (the adoptive parents of her younger sibling). \n159.  DSS is attempting to monitor communications between the biological parents and \nher younger brother’s adoptive parents, including requesting screenshots of text conversations \nregarding her brother, who is no longer in DSS custody. \n160.  The former foster parent’s social worker told her that if continued to fight for Ava, \nit could be held against her and she would not be approved for future adoptions. \n161.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and lack of action, Ava has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer harm. Defendants have failed to provide a constitutionally adequate level of \ncare, departed from professional judgment, not provided timely and appropriate services, and they \nhave acted with deliberate indifference. Due to Defendants’ actions, Ava’s health continues to \ndeteriorate due to forced separation from her siblings, to instability in her home situation, and to \ndelayed services. Were it not for Defendants’ actions, Ava would have received the professionally \nrecommended services necessary for her mental health and achieved permanency through adoption \nin a stable home with one of her biological siblings. \nRene S. \n162.  Rene S. is a 6-year-old girl from Rockingham County. Rene appears in this action \nthrough her next friend, Jackson Albert. Mr. Albert is an undergraduate student at the University \n  33\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 33 of 99\n\n \nof North Carolina Chapel Hill. He grew close to Rene while she was placed in his parents’ home, \nand he considers himself Rene’s older brother. Mr. Albert has acquainted himself with the \nallegations in the Complaint regarding Rene’s experience in foster care and is dedicated to her best \ninterests. \n163.  Rene has an 8-year-old brother. Both siblings were removed in February 2024 due \nto physical abuse at the hands of their stepfather. \n164.  Rene and her brother spent approximately seven weeks in one foster home before \nthey came in April to live with Mr. Albert’s family: his mother, father, and sibling. Mr. Albert’s \nmother, Mrs. Albert is a former social worker and licensed foster parent. \n165.  Within a month after their arrival, Mrs. Albert caught the two siblings performing \nsexual acts on one another. She immediately notified Rockingham County DSS by calling the \ncrisis hotline. Mrs. Albert and her husband decided to put the two siblings in separate bedrooms \nas they had previously shared a room. This necessitated one of their biological children to sleep \non the sofa.  \n166.  Eventually, the situation became untenable, and they decided to ask DSS to move \nRene’s brother to a new placement in August 2024. DSS initially could not find him a placement, \nbut after a week they moved him to a temporary placement. Between August and the date of this \nfiling, he has been moved to new placements at least three times. In October, he was moved to a \nmore “permanent” placement, which is two hours away from his sister.  \n167.  When they came to the Alberts home, both children were wearing pull up diapers \nand their skin was covered in blisters from sitting in their own urine all day. Rene could barely \nspeak and her speech was so unintelligible that her brother had to translate for her. Rene could not \neven count to ten.  \n  34\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 34 of 99\n\n \n168.  Since Rene has been with the Alberts, she has thrived. Her speech has exploded. \nShe can now count into the 30s, knows her ABCs, and can spell and write her own name. The \nAlberts enrolled her in a private kindergarten because she was so academically behind. There are \nonly 8 children in the classroom and Rene has greatly benefited from the small classroom setting.  \n169.  In April, the Alberts immediately requested speech therapy for Rene, but she was \non a waitlist for several months and only just began speech therapy in October. \n170.   Rene developed a trusting relationship with Mrs. Albert. Rene eventually revealed \nthat she endured repeated sexual abuse at the hands of her stepfather. Rene provided specific and \nconcrete details about her experiences, indicating to Mrs. Albert that she was telling the truth about \nthe horrific abuse she endured. Mrs. Albert reported the sexual abuse to Rockingham County DSS \nand Rene’s assigned DSS caseworker. Mrs. Albert asked DSS for a forensic interview to explore \nRene’s sexual abuse, but DSS refused. Upon information and belief, DSS has not formally \nacknowledged Rene’s history of sexual abuse.  \n171.  Rene  has  supervised  visits  with  her  mother  and  stepfather  for two  hours  on \nWednesday evenings at the Rockingham County DSS office. September 11, 2024, was the first \ntime that she had a supervised visit without her brother, who participated via zoom due to the \ndistance from his new placement. A few days after the visit, Rene had an emotional meltdown and \nconfessed to Mrs. Albert that her stepfather had touched her in her private area during their last \nvisit. She said that it occurred while her stepfather was rocking her. Mrs. Albert consoled Rene \nand told her it was not her fault.  \n172.  Mrs.  Albert  reported  the  incident  to  their  social  worker.  The  social  worker \nresponded that Rene was probably just confused and that kids get things mixed up. \n  35\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 35 of 99\n\n \n173.  Rene had another supervised visit that week. Before she went to the visit, Mrs. \nAlbert encouraged her to stay, “stop, please,” if her stepfather tried to touch her inappropriately \nduring the visit. When Mrs. Albert picked her up that evening, Rene told her that nothing happened. \nHowever, the next day, Rene was hiding behind her book as if she was embarrassed. She confessed \nthat she was sorry, but she was not actually a brave little girl because her stepfather did touch her \nduring the visit, and she was too scared to tell him to stop. She provided details about how he did \nit—he held her on his lap and had his fingers under her in a way in which he was able to touch her \nprivate area. \n174.  When Mrs. Albert reported this to the social worker, the social worker said her \nhands were tied. The Rockingham County DSS office took no action. \n175.  Mrs.  Albert  called  a  children’s  advocacy  group  and  a  child  therapist.  Both \nprofessionals advised her that based on her knowledge of these facts, she had a mandatory \nobligation to file a police report.  \n176.   Mrs. Albert informed the DSS social worker that she intended to file a police \nreport. The social worker contacted the Rockingham County DSS office to notify them that a report \nwould be filed. \n177.  Within an hour, Mrs. Albert received a call from the DSS office notifying her that \nRene would be removed from their home. Mrs. Albert understood this to be retaliatory action in \nresponse to her intention to file a formal police report and more generally her advocacy for Rene. \n178.  Mrs. Albert learned that a woman, whom Rene had never met before, came to her \nschool to pick her up and took her to a new placement without saying goodbye to the Alberts or \nbothering to retrieve her clothes or medication, including an Epi-pen for emergencies.  \n  36\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 36 of 99\n\n \n179.  The sudden change was devastating and destabilizing. Rene had been making \nfriends. She had birthday parties she planned to attend that weekend. She had just begun speech \ntherapy after months of being on a waitlist. Rene was thriving in the Alberts home, and was healing \nfrom her trauma in a loving, supportive, and stable home environment. \n180.  During the period Rene lived with the Alberts (from April 2024 to October 2024), \nthey cycled through 4 to 5 social workers, none of whom remained long enough to learn Rene’s \ncase sufficiently. One social worker was moonlighting as a social worker with Rockingham DSS \nand so was only available to speak with the Alberts at night. \n181.  Mrs. Albert filed the police report, considering her moral obligation to try to protect \nRene from the sexual abuse she was enduring at the hands of her stepfather—to which Rockingham \nDSS was shockingly indifferent. Moreover, Rockingham DSS affirmatively caused harm to Rene \nby unnecessarily and capriciously removing her from a stable and loving home in which she was \nthriving. \n182.  After Rene’s removal, Mrs. Albert communicated with the former foster mother \nwith whom Rene and her brother lived prior to coming to the Alberts. Their former foster mother \nwas stunned when she learned that Rockingham DSS had not informed Mrs. Albert about the \nchildren’s history of sexual abuse. The prior foster parent said that Rene’s brother had confided in \nher numerous times regarding the sexual abuse he endured from the children’s stepfather. She had \nreported it to the children’s social worker and his supervisor. Despite these reports, DSS did not \nformally document the sexual abuse. Nor did they notify the Alberts when the children came to \nlive with them.  \n  37\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 37 of 99\n\n \n183.  Echoing the retaliation against Mrs. Albert, the children were removed from the \nprior foster home shortly after their foster mother began asking questions regarding the sexual \nabuse.  \n184.  These events underscore Rockingham DSS’s deliberate indifference to Rene’s \nwellbeing, and the manner in which their actions are guided not by the best interest of the child, \nbut by expediency, willful blindness, and retaliatory animus.  \n185.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Rene has suffered, and \ncontinues to suffer, emotional and psychological harm. Defendants failed to exercised reasonable \nprofessional judgment, failed to respond to credible allegations of abuse, made affirmatively \ndetrimental case planning and placement decisions that run counter to the goals of foster care—\nsafety, stability, and permanency, and acted with deliberate indifference to Rene’s legal rights. \n186.  Rene has been needlessly subjected to placement instability, a lack of appropriate \nservices, delayed permanency, and potential ongoing sexual abuse by her stepfather all to avoid \ndealing with an obvious and critical danger to Rene and the avoidable trauma of removing her \nfrom a supportive home and stable foster home.  \nAlice B. \n187.  Alice B. is a 16-year-old girl from Harnett County. She has spent over half of her \nlife in DSS custody, and she has been a legal orphan for more than six years. Alice appears in this \naction through her next friend, Kimberly Crothers. As a foster child herself, Ms. Crothers knows \nfirst-hand the experiences that Alice is going through. And throughout Alice’s time in foster care, \nMs. Crothers has encouraged Alice to stay positive and persevere. Ms. Crothers has acquainted \nherself with the allegations in the Complaint regarding Alice’s experience in foster care and is \ndedicated to her best interests. \n  38\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 38 of 99\n\n \n188.  In August 2014, Harnett DSS removed Alice from the custody of her father and \nstepmother  based  on  allegations  of  neglect.  At  that  time,  Alice’s  biological  mother  was \nincarcerated in Pennsylvania. \n189.  In November 2017, Alice’s father voluntarily relinquished his parental rights. In \nMay 2018, Alice’s mother’s parental rights were terminated. At that time, Alice was ten years old. \nNow, over six years later, Alice remains a legal orphan. \n190.  Since she was removed in 2014, DSS has moved Alice over eighteen times, cycling \nher through a serious of foster homes, group homes institutions, and out-of-state facilities. Alice \nspent four months in a PRTF in South Carolina, two months in in-state crisis centers and PRTFs, \none year in a cottage community, and over two-and-a-half years in group homes. During a two-\nmonth period in 2023, DSS moved Alice five times. \n191.  Alice suffered serious physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. When Alice became \na legal orphan in May 2018, she was placed in a pre-adoptive home with her two siblings. Her \noldest brother repeatedly sexually molested her. When she reported this to the foster mother, the \nshe locked the siblings in a closet for “family therapy” and instructed them to work it out. The \nabuse did not stop. Upon information and belief, after Alice reported the sexual abuse to her \ncaseworker, Alice was removed and placed in an institution. \n192.  In one group home, Alice was confined to her room and was constantly concerned \nabout the lack of adult supervision. She feared violence and sexual abuse from other foster children \nin the group home. Afraid for her safety, Alice ran away from the group home. \n193.  The placement instability and safety threats have caused Alice’s condition to \ndeteriorate significantly.  She  runs  away  frequently,  engages  in  self-harming  behaviors,  and \nstruggles in school. \n  39\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 39 of 99\n\n \n194.  In October 2024, Alice ran away from a group home. During this time, Alice was \nforced into unsupervised visits with the brother who sexually abused her and the pre-adoptive \nfamily that ignored the abuse.  \n195.  On October 11, Alice appeared at a court hearing. At the end of the hearing, Alice \nwas taken back into Harnett DSS custody. Alice pleaded that she would rather go to jail than return \nto Harnett DSS custody. \n196.  On November 12, one week before her permanency hearing, Harnett DSS placed \nAlice in New Hope, a PRTF in South Carolina. She is blocked from communicating with anyone \noutside the facility, and she is being denied off-campus time due to her runaway history. \n197.  Harnett DSS requested that the permanency plan remain adoption or guardianship. \nBut upon information and belief, Harnett DSS is doing nothing to accomplish either goal.  \n198.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Alice has suffered and \ncontinues  to  suffer  emotional  and  psychological  harm.  If Defendants  had  made  reasonable \nprofessional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, equipped \ncaseworkers with a reliable information system, not acted in disregard of reasonable professional \nstandards as to the management of Alice’s case, and not acted with deliberate indifference to her \nlegal rights, Defendants may have prevented Alice’s condition from deteriorating while in state \ncustody.  Alice  remains  at  risk  of  deterioration  due  to  placement  instability,  unjust \ninstitutionalization, and delayed permanency. \nII.  Defendants \n199.  Defendant Governor Roy Cooper is the Governor of North Carolina and is sued \nsolely in his official capacity. He is the chief executive of North Carolina and charged with \n  40\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 40 of 99\n\n \nfaithfully executing the laws of North Carolina, as well as administering the daily affairs of the \nstate.

This action consists of one general class and one subclass:  \n220.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 11,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DSS under \nthe supervision of DHHS and/or with whom DHHS has a special relationship. \n  44\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 44 of 99\n\n \na.  A class comprised of all children for whom North Carolina DHHS has or will have \nlegal  responsibility  and/or  a  special  relationship  in  the  context  of  the  child \nprotection system (the “General Class”). \nb.  A subclass comprised of all members of the General Class who have or will have \nemotional, psychological, cognitive, or physical disabilities (the “ADA Subclass”). \nc.  A subclass comprised of all members of the General Class for whom County \nDefendants have or will have legal responsibility and/or a special relationship in \nthe context of the child protection system (the “County Subclass”). \nNumerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n221.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 11,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DHHS \nand/or with whom DHHS has a special relationship. \n222.

The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the General Class and the \nADA Subclass Class, as their claims arise from the same policies, practices, or courses of conduct; \nand their claims are based on the same theory of law as the subclass’s claims. \n225.  The questions of fact and law raised by named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n  45\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 45 of 99\n\n \n226.  Questions of fact common to the General Class include:  \na.  whether state Defendants fail to maintain a case management system capable of \nadequately protecting foster children; \nb.  whether state Defendants fail to adequately supervise county DSS; \nc.  whether state and county Defendants fail to recruit and retain sufficient number and \ndiversity of foster care homes; \nd.  whether state and county Defendants fail to maintain a system that protects foster \nchildren from physical, psychological, and emotional harm; \ne.  whether state and county Defendants fail to maintain a system that provides \npermanency to foster children within a reasonable period of time; \n227.  Questions of fact common to the ADA Subclass include:  \na.  whether state Defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiffs within the ADA \nSubclass by supervising the State’s foster care system in a manner that denies \nqualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State’s services, programs, or \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, and by failing to \nreasonably modify the State’s foster care system to avoid discrimination against \nchildren with disabilities. \n228.

North Carolina is a state-supervised, county-administered child welfare system. \nThe state agency—North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”)—and \nthe 100 county departments of social services (“county DSS”) share responsibility for the safety \nand wellbeing of children in foster care. \nI.  DHHS \n236.  DHHS is “the sole state agency responsible for administering or supervising the \nadministration of the Child Welfare Services Program in North Carolina.” DHHS is responsible \nfor supervising all 100 county DSS. G.S. § 108A-1, -71, -74. DHHS must enter into written \nagreements with county DSS specifying “mandated performance requirements and administrative \nresponsibilities”; if a county DSS fails to comply with the written agreement or mandated \nperformance requirements, DHHS must implement a corrective action plan, and if the county DSS \nfails to comply with the corrective action plan, DHHS must “temporarily assume all or part of the \ndepartment’s social services administration” and “develop and implement a corrective plan of \naction.” G.S. § 108A-74(a2), (a3), (c), (j). Alternatively, DHHS must assume control of social \nservices administration when DHHS  determines that a county DSS “is not providing child \nprotective, foster care, or adoption services in accordance with State law…or fails to demonstrate \nreasonable efforts to do so, and the failure to provide the services poses a substantial threat to the \nsafety and welfare of children in the county.” G.S. § 108A-74(h). \n  49\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 49 of 99\n\n \n237.  DHHS is responsible for developing statewide training programs for County DSS \n(G.S. § 108A-71, -74). \n238.  Foster parent licensing, recruitment, and retention processes are shared between the \nstate and counties. DHHS is responsible for: “[e]stablishing state licensure standards and state \npolicy for how counties will work with foster and adoptive parents; [e]stablishing statewide board \nrates and participating ‘50-50’ with the counties in paying the non-federal share of the rates; \n[r]eviewing  applications  for  licensure  submitted  by  county  or  private  provider  agencies; \n[c]ollecting and maintaining data on licensed foster homes and licensing actions; and [d]eveloping \na statewide diligent recruitment and retention (DRR) plan and working with each county to \ndevelop county DRR plans.” NC APSR 2023 at 66; G.S. § 131D-10.3, 10.6. \n239.  DHHS, county DSS, and  Local Management Entity/Managed Care Organizations \n(LME/MCOs) share responsibility for providing health services to children in foster care. LMEs \n“are responsible for the management and oversight of the public system of mental health, \ndevelopmental disabilities, and substance abuse services at the community level,” and must “plan, \ndevelop, implement, and monitor services within a specified geographic area.” G.S. § 122C-115.4. \nDHHS is responsible “for the coordination of public services between area authorities, county \nprograms,  and  State  facilities,”  and  for  ensuring  that  LME/MCOs  are  properly  managing \nbehavioral health services. G.S. § 122C-111, 124.2. When a county DSS “wishes to disengage \nfrom a local management entity/managed care organization,” DHHS must, among other things, \nensure that the “[p]rovision of services is not disrupted by the disengagement.” G.S. § 122C-\n115(a3)(1). DHHS must implement a corrective action plan or assume direct control of operations \nwhen minimally adequate services are not being provided by LME/MCOs. G.S. § 122C-124.1. \n  50\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 50 of 99\n\n \nDHHS is also responsible for determining how appropriated funds will be allocated throughout \nthe state. G.S. § 122C-147.1.  \nII.  COUNTY DSS \n240.  County DSS have statutory duties and responsibilities to “administer the programs \nof public assistance and social services”; “appoint necessary personnel”; “assess reports of child \nabuse and neglect and to take appropriate action to protect such children”; “accept children for \nplacement in foster homes and to supervise placements for so long as such children require foster \nhome care.” G.S. § 108A-14. Binding regulations promulgated by DHHS define the duties and \nresponsibilities of county DSS regarding personnel and caseload standards (10A NCAC 70G \n.0501), out-of-home placement  procedures (10A NCAC 70G .0503),  and case management \nservices (10A NCAC 70G .0504). County DSS must also enter into agreements with LME/MCOs \nto provide health services to children in foster care. G.S. § 122C-115, -115.2.   \n241.  State law requires that “Social Workers or Case Managers serving children in \nfamily foster homes shall serve no more than 15 children.  Social Workers or Case Managers \nserving children in therapeutic foster homes shall serve no more than 12 children.”  (10A NCAC \n70G.0501) \n242.  County  DSS  are  responsible  for  “recruiting,  training,  and  supporting  foster \nparents,” as well as “recommend[ing] the licensure of foster homes to [DHHS].” 10A NCAC 70G \n.0402(11). County DSS “complete licensure applications that are submitted to NC DSS for review \nand approval”; and “[p]rovide ongoing training and support to foster parents who are licensed.” \nCounty DSS are also responsible “for providing case management to children placed in foster \nhomes and for conducting regular visits with children and foster parents in the homes.” \n \n  51\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 51 of 99\n\n \nWIDESPREAD SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN NORTH CAROLINA’S CHILD WELFARE \nSYSTEM CONTINUE TO HARM ITS FOSTER CHILDREN \nI.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Fuel North Carolina’s Placement Crisis \n243.  Child welfare policy requires that children in foster care reside in family-like \nenvironments, in or close to their home communities, and with kin caregivers and siblings \nwhenever possible. Stable and appropriate placement for children in foster care is essential for \nchild safety and wellbeing, and maintenance of family bonds. Without appropriate and supported \nfoster homes, or appropriate specialized treatment programs, agencies must cycle children through \nhomes, institutions, group placements, and other temporary and emergency placements with \ndisturbing frequency. Additionally, the lack of foster homes creates an overreliance on placements \nthat are unsafe and inappropriate for children, including congregate care settings. . \n244.  Placement instability produces a cascade of intersecting and compounding harms, \nincluding: (i) a disruption of a child’s sense of security and attachment to their caregivers; (ii) a \nreenactment of the trauma of removal; (iii) a reduced likelihood of reunification and exiting from \ncare and an increased likelihood of returning to care after reunification; (iv) a disruption in a child’s \neducation; (v) a loss of the opportunity to establish long-term relationships with adults; (vii) an \nincreased risk of abuse and neglect; (viii) a risk of developmental delays or setbacks because of \ndisrupted attachment and inconsistent caregiving; (ix) a greater likelihood of running away from \ntheir placements; (x) a disruption of a child’s therapeutic relationship with their mental health care \nprovider and gaps in treatment; (xi) an exacerbation of mental health symptoms; (xii) delays in \nreceiving  a  diagnosis  or  accessing  treatment  for  mental  health  conditions;  (xiii)  difficultly \nestablishing  coping  mechanisms  and  adaptive  behaviors  to  manage  stress  and  emotional \nchallenges; and (xiv) increases in rates of juvenile delinquency and institutionalization. \n  52\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 52 of 99\n\n \n245.  North Carolina has failed to license, recruit, and retain a sufficient number of \nappropriate foster homes, and to provide necessary supports to those homes, which causes children \nto be housed in unsafe and inappropriate settings. DHHS acknowledges that the number of children \nwith complex behavioral needs “far exceeds the space and services available to keep them safe, \nhelp them overcome crisis and reunite them with family and community,” and that the lack of \nappropriate placements forces the agency to house children in hospital emergency rooms, DSS \noffices, or hotel rooms. “‘Living’ in these inappropriate settings compounds the trauma that \nchildren experience during separation from their families and natural support systems. The longer \nchildren are separated from their families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and \nthey run a higher risk of experiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness \nand involvement with the justice system.” \n246.  North Carolina’s placement crisis has been echoed by numerous DHHS and DSS \nsenior managers and employees. In September of 2022, when DHHS Assistant Secretary for \nCounty Operations, Susan Osborne, told county directors of social services departments that the \nsystem was in “crisis” and that “there could be a massive class action lawsuit,” she was referring \nto housing children in DSS offices or holding children with emotional and behavioral health needs \nin emergency rooms beyond discharge because there was nowhere else to place them. Similarly in \nMarch 2022, a NC Health News article discussed that foster children “have been even further \ntraumatized  in  North  Carolina  recently  by  having  to  sleep  in  the  offices  of  social  service \ndepartments, in hospital emergency rooms or local hotels as child welfare workers search for a \nsafe bed and temporary housing.”   \n247.  The Director of Wake County’s Division of Child Welfare, Paige Rosemond, has \nbeen quoted as saying: “We have definitely experienced an increase in not having a placement \n  53\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 53 of 99\n\n \nand, in turn, having children at our building awaiting placement . . . Up to two children at a time \nstay at the Wake County Human Services building on a blow-up mattress or a recliner waiting to \nfind a transition home.” Rosemond added: “That’s what keeps me up at night because I know that \nthese kids’ needs are not being met while at our building. Staffers call hundreds of foster facilities \nacross the country for placement, but there simply aren’t enough. We have facilities that are just \ntelling us no we can’t serve that youth.” Children “need the stability. They yearn for it, they’re \nhungry for it . . . If they can get into a home where they feel cared for and safe and like there’s no \nthreat that they’re going to have to go anywhere again, they bloom . . . I struggle with the fact that \nwe may be, as an individual system and the systems across the state that are serving this shared \npopulation, that we are failing these children.” Wake County Child Welfare Co-Interim Director, \nSheila Donaldson, confirmed that “[t]urning part of an office building into a makeshift shelter for \ndays or even weeks is now a common last resort. On any given night, as many as nine children \nhave slept in the Wake County Social Services Office because of the shortages.” \n248.  The executive director of a housing service has called the situation “really dire.” \nShe explained that “[t]here are not enough places for kids” and that in meetings with DSS \nleadership, DSS has relayed that there are “kids sleeping in the conference room and that they were \nhaving to partner with other organizations for things like showers and meals[.]” The reporter was \nunable to get answers from the county DSS about why kids are sleeping in buildings, and “[w]hen \npressed,” a DSS spokesperson would only say that “DSS has nothing further to add and appreciates \nyour efforts to assist in recruiting foster care placements.” \n249.  North Carolina has known about its placement problems for many years, at least \nsince 2015 when the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) found that North Carolina’s \nsystem of foster and adoptive parent licensing, recruitment, and retention was “not in substantial \n  54\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 54 of 99\n\n \nconformity” with national standards. Among other things, the CFSR noted delays in receiving \nbackground check results from DHHS, uncertainty surrounding counties’ access to background \ncheck information, and the lack of a statewide process to ensure that counties are consistently \naddressing negative criminal background findings. Additionally, North Carolina “does not have a \nuniform system in place across the state that monitors or provides consistent standards for diligent \nrecruitment,” and “recruitment efforts vary by county and are not coordinated at the state level.” \n250.  North Carolina’s capacity crisis has ballooned over the past decade. In 2012, there \nwere 6,920 non-relative foster homes in North Carolina; in 2022, there were only 5,183. In 2018, \nthere were 6,306 total licensed foster homes; in 2022, only 5,436. Meanwhile, the number of foster \nchildren increased from approximately 8,400 in 2012 to 10,200 in 2022. As foster home capacity \ndecreases and the foster care population increases, North Carolina’s foster children find themselves \nin jails, emergency rooms, DSS offices, homeless shelters, hotels, and other inappropriate and \nunsafe settings. \n251.  The Queen City News reported in March 2023 that as North Carolina has suffered \na 20% decrease in foster families over the last four years, “foster children have begun to endure \nmore challenging situations, including ‘living’ out of cots in jails, DSS offices, and emergency \nrooms because there are not enough foster families in the state to accommodate them.” According \nto the reporting, one hospital group confirmed that more than a dozen children with complex \nbehavioral health needs were living in emergency rooms in one area in North Carolina, and seven \nother children were similarly situated in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. \n252.  North Carolina’s foster home deficit is contributing to an increased reliance on \ncongregate care. As DHHS recently observed, “data on the use of congregate care suggests North \nCarolina lacks an adequate supply of family foster homes in at least some counties and regions…. \n  55\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 55 of 99\n\n \nAccording to their social workers, the most common reason was the lack of an available family \nfoster home.” In 2021, North Carolina ranked among the 10 worst states for placing foster children \nin group homes. The percentage of North Carolina foster children living in congregate care (13%) \nis nearly double the national average (7%). \n253.  The lack of appropriate foster homes in North Carolina has led to a dramatic \nincrease in placement instability. As Secretary Kinsley acknowledged, “among the children who \nstruggle to find an appropriate placement that have been referred to the department for additional \nhelp and coordination, a quarter of these children have been moved fifty times or more.” Between \n2017 to 2021, for children in care less than 12 months, the percentage of children with three or \nmore placements increased 10% (from 9% to 19.4%); for children 12-24 months in care, 19% \n(from 22.8% to 41.7%); for children 24+ months in care, 15% (from 55% to 70.2%). Nearly 1 in \n4 foster children in North Carolina have changed placements four or more times. In 2021, North \nCarolina ranked in the bottom 10 states for placement stability. \n254.  Finally, the lack of appropriate foster homes has encouraged a disturbing practice \nby many County DSS of abandoning foster children in hospital emergency rooms with little agency \ncontact and no educational or mental health services. \n255.  According to North Carolina law, “[t]he State recognizes the importance of foster \nparents in the vital role of supporting children and families experiencing foster care. When children \nare removed from their parents or legal guardians, families are almost immediately integrated into \na team, including child welfare workers, resource parents, a guardian ad litem, attorneys, and \nothers who are working together to address the issues leading to the foster care.”  DHHS stated in \nNorth Carolina’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan: “Having a sufficient, diverse pool \nof foster, adoptive, and kinship families will help North Carolina achieve better outcomes for \n  56\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 56 of 99\n\n \nchildren. Specifically, having a pool of families who are diverse, well-trained, and able to meet the \nspecific needs of children in foster care will provide placement stability; ensure children and \nyouth’s well-being needs are met; allow children and youth to remain in their own schools and \ncommunities; and provide timely permanency for children and youth who are unable to return \nhome.” \n256.  A primary contributor to the lack of foster homes is DHHS/DSS’s treatment of \ncurrent and prospective foster parents. Specifically, the culture of fear and retribution in North \nCarolina deters foster parents from seeking and maintaining a license. Upon information and \nbelief, county DSS routinely retaliate against foster parents for voicing opinions or opposing DSS \nrecommendations by removing or threatening to remove their foster children, and by substantiating \nor threatening to substantiate allegations of abuse and neglect against them. Instead of being treated \nas critical members of the child welfare team, foster parents who request services for their foster \nchildren are often told that they “can’t take care of the child,” that they “are giving up on the child,” \nor that they are “getting too close to the child.” North Carolina’s treatment of foster parents causes \nfoster parents to stop accepting placements, discourages foster parents from renewing their \nlicenses, and deters prospective foster parents from seeking a license. \n257.  Adding to the recruitment and retention problem, foster parents have little to no \nrecourse  against  these  practices.  The  North  Carolina  Foster  Parents’  Bill  of  Rights  is  an \naspirational statement, not an enforceable contract. If DSS violate these rights, foster parents have \nno recourse.  \n258.  Lacking appropriate foster homes, North Carolina has increasingly relied upon \ngroup homes for placement. Sometimes referred to as “foster communities” or “campus-based \nfoster care,” these placements house children in “cottages,” each staffed by “professional parents.” \n  57\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 57 of 99\n\n \nThese “professional parents” live in the foster community and rotate in and out on a weekly basis. \nNorth Carolina’s reliance upon foster communities places children at serious risk of harm. First, \nupon information and belief, North Carolina counts a foster community as one placement even \nthough children are frequently transferred between cottage homes and “parents” within the \ncommunity. Studies suggest that “every move counts,” and North Carolina’s failure to account for \nthese intra-community moves and professional foster parent rotations obscures the scope of North \nCarolina’s placement instability problems. Second, upon information and belief, the “professional \nparent” model is incompatible with evidence-based treatments like Trauma-Based Cognitive \nBehavioral Therapy (TB-CBT) because TB-CBT requires a consistent caregiver. Additionally, the \ninsular nature of these communities restricts children’s access to health services outside the \ncommunity, and health professionals have significant difficultly providing services to children \nliving inside the community. Finally, foster care communities contribute to a lack of permanency \nbecause the children are not placed with people who, for the most part, will be interested in \nadopting them if they cannot be reunited with their parents, or are otherwise committed to their \nwell-being. \n259.  North Carolina knows or should know that its policies, practices, and customs \ncontribute to a decline in foster parent recruitment and retention, and that the failure to maintain a \nsufficient number of appropriate homes places foster children at serious risk of irreparable harm. \nIndeed, DHHS keeps an ongoing tally of children placed in inappropriate crisis settings. As DHHS \nacknowledged: “inappropriate settings compounds the trauma that children experienced during \nseparation from their families and natural support systems. The longer children are separated from \ntheir families, the less likely they are to be reunified with them, and they run a higher risk of \n  58\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 58 of 99\n\n \nexperiencing poor health and social outcomes, including homelessness and involvement with the \njustice system.” \nII.  Defendants’  Policies  and  Practices  Cause  Crushing  Caseloads  and  Caseworker \nTurnover \n260.  Qualified caseworkers are vital to the administration of every child welfare system. \nThey are responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency, and well-being of children who are at \nrisk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. To carry out this critical task, they must assess the needs of \neach child and family, develop individualized plans to meet those needs, and monitor progress \ntoward achieving the desired outcomes. \n261.  When caseworkers have manageable caseloads, they can provide comprehensive \nand individualized services to each child and family in their care. They can take the time to build \nrapport, engage in meaningful conversations, and identify the unique needs and strengths of each \nchild and family. They can work collaboratively with other professionals and community resources \nto address complex issues and provide timely interventions. As a result, they can help ensure that \nchildren are safe, supported, and able to thrive in their families and communities. \n262.  For this to happen, the Child Welfare League of America (“CWLA”), a national \ncoalition of agencies that develops child welfare policies, has recommended that caseloads be \nbetween 12 and 15 children per worker for children in foster care. The Council on Accreditation \n(“COA”), a national professional licensing organization, has recommended that caseloads be 12 \nto 15 children per worker and only eight children where the child is in treatment foster care. \n263.  North Carolina has set its own standards, in 10A NCAC 70G.0501, at 15 children \nfor children placed in foster family homes and at 12 children for children placed in therapeutic \nfoster homes. The counties regularly ignore and fail to maintain these standards. And DHHS does \nnot take steps to determine whether these standards are complied with. \n  59\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 59 of 99\n\n \n264.  When caseloads exceed these standards, caseworkers are unable to devote the \nnecessary time and attention to each child in their care. Additionally, overburdened workers often \nexperience burnout and high levels of stress, leading to turnover and a shortage of experienced \nworkers.  High  turnover  increases  caseload  burdens  on  remaining  caseworkers,  reduces \nproductivity and morale, increases feelings of hopelessness and frustration, and this caustic \nworkplace fuels the vicious turnover cycle. This combination of unmanageable caseloads and high \ncaseworker turnover creates a “cycle of crisis” that allows children to fall through the cracks. \n265.  Unmanageable caseloads feed caseworker turnover, which commonly results in \ndelayed permanency for foster children. One study found that foster children with one caseworker \nin a given year had an approximately 75% chance of achieving permanency, those with two \ncaseworkers had an approximately 18% chance of permanency, and those with more than three \ncaseworkers had only a 2% chance of permanency. In addition, caseworker turnover is high, with \naverage statewide turnover at 27%; one-in-four counties has a turnover rate higher than 40%. \n266.  North Carolina has been stuck in this cycle of crisis caused by crushing caseloads \nand chronic turnover. A 2016 report by the Public Consulting Group found that only half of CPS \nand in-home social workers were within the state’s recommended caseload size according to “self-\nreported” case load sizes. Staff reported that “the stress of child protection and the secondary \ntrauma and burnout of CPS leads to greater turnover, which may be an underappreciated cause by \nleadership.” When caseworkers quit, “counties must scramble to fill their position and in the \nmeantime, the responsibilities for the cases are assumed by other social workers with full caseloads \nthemselves.” \n267.  Several years later, DHHS noted in its 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan \nthat “Child welfare staff feel overwhelmed, unable to complete the work they are assigned, and \n  60\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 60 of 99\n\n \nstruggling to manage a work-life balance.” A “common theme” replayed by stakeholders was that \n“staff turnover is a major issue. County DSS staff need more training and support to mitigate this \ncritical issue.” Additionally, “barriers to implementation [of certain reforms] include current \ncaseloads of foster care staff which exceed the standard youth to staff ratio.” \n268.  According  to  North  Carolina’s  2022  Annual  Progress  and  Services  Report, \n“[r]ecent feedback from local child welfare agencies indicates that the increased workload on child \nwelfare workers has led to worker turnover and burnout.” From 2020 to 2022, turnover rates \nincreased from 23% to 34%, and vacancy rates increased from 13% to 23%. \n269.  DHHS does not verify self-reported compliance with caseload standards, nor has it \nestablished any mandatory performance metrics related to caseload standards. DHHS guidance \nprovides that “CPS Intake shall be no greater than one worker per 100 CPS referrals a month; CPS \nAssessments shall be no greater than 10 families at any time per worker; CPS In‐Home Services \nshall be no greater than 10 families at any time per worker.” Compliance with caseloads standards \nis evaluated through quarterly self-reports from county DSS and semi-annual reviews; however, \nDHHS admits that the data “is not fully vetted and verified.” \n270.  DHHS  has not  “establish[ed] a universal definition for caseload across child \nwelfare,” despite the state law requirement setting of caseload standards by child for children in \ncustody.  North Carolina’s 100 counties apply different processes to calculating caseload sizes and \ndefine “caseload” in different ways, and there is no system for weighting blended caseloads and \nresponsibilities. Without an accurate understanding of actual caseloads across the state, and how \nmany children workers are responsible for, DHHS is incapable of addressing the caseload-turnover \ncycle of crisis. \n  61\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 61 of 99\n\n \n271.  DHHS has received numerous warnings that its failure to address the caseload and \nturnover issues threaten the safety and wellbeing of foster children. The North Carolina Office of \nState Personnel reported in 2004 that “the turnover and retention problems have become so acute \nas to seriously compromise the safety and well being of the most vulnerable children.” The 2015 \nCFSR flagged concerns related to caseloads and workloads. An independent audit by Public \nConsulting Group in 2016 notified DHHS that “[l]arge caseloads and excessive workloads make \nit difficult for CPS social workers to serve families effectively and can contribute to burnout and \nturnover” while “[m]anageable caseloads and workloads can make a real difference in a social \nworker’s ability to spend adequate time with children and families, improve staff retention, and \nultimately have a positive impact on outcomes for children and families.” The report warned that \n“[t]he lack of a consistent statewide definition of ‘caseload’ makes it difficult” to calculate \ncaseload sizes reported by county DSS. A subsequent audit by the Center for the Support of \nFamilies reprised these concerns, noting that “it is not possible for caseworkers with caseloads at \nthe current standards to meet the current expectations for their positions.” And most recently, \nDHHS was warned that “[i]ncreased workloads leave staff with less time to establish relationships \nwith children and families, conduct frequent and meaningful home visits, and make thoughtful and \nwell-supported decisions regarding safe and stable placements.” \n272.  Despite these warnings, DHHS has failed take meaningful steps to address the \nissue. DHHS committed to completing a caseload and workload study by September 2021, but \nDHHS never did, causing the North Carolina Association of County Departments of Social \nServices to ask in a January 23, 2023 meeting “are we ever going to re-evaluate case load \nstandards?” \n  62\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 62 of 99\n\n \n273.  Given the issues with caseloads and turnover, North Carolina has also faced \nongoing issues in caseworker training. The 2015 CFSR noted significant issues in initial and \nongoing staff training, which contributes to additional turnover. North Carolina received a rating \nof “Area Needing Improvement” for initial staff training, noting that “demand for and locations of \nthe  trainings  created  barriers  to  attendance  resulting  in  delayed  start  dates  for  some  new \nemployees.” Moreover, “the initial training does not fully prepare staff because it does not provide \nthem with the basic skills necessary to do their work,” and it is not clear that caseworkers are even \nengaging in the training because “the state does not have a good system for tracking staff \nparticipation in online training.” \n274.  The Public Consulting Group Report noted that “34 percent of frontline social \nworkers reported that trainings are often too full to register,” “54 percent of frontline social workers \nreported that training locations were inconvenient,” and “65 percent of frontline social workers \nreported that they are too busy with cases to attend trainings.” Moreover, supervisors and DSS \ncounty leadership reported that the training that new employees were able to attend was “not \nadequately preparing new social workers for the challenges of CPS.” Specifically, in a statewide \nsurvey, “53 percent of leadership surveyed reported that pre-service did not prepare social workers \nfor CPS” and that the “pre-service training is structured as an introduction to child welfare, but \ndoes not provide knowledge on how to do CPS work.”  \n275.  North Carolina’s crushing caseloads and chronic turnover has forced the state to \nrely on untrained and unqualified caseworkers. When hiring caseworkers, county DSS submit \napplications to the North Carolina Office of State Human Resources. When counties are unable to \nfind qualified candidates, state regulations permit counties to hire unqualified employees in a \n“work-against” status, “allowing the employee to gain the qualifications needed for the full class \n  63\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 63 of 99\n\n \nthrough on-the-job experience.” No state agency has the power to enforce these rules. The PCG \nreport showed that “smaller, more rural . . . counties have to make tradeoffs to hire social workers \nwho are not fully qualified.” Indeed, the average of qualified hires in any set of counties was at \nmost still less than 60%. \n276.  Issues with recruitment and retention have been noted in North Carolina media. For \nexample, the DSS Director for Lenoir County warned of a “recruitment and retention pandemic, \nacross the board.” In 2021, Lenoir County has a turnover rate of 61%. According to this DSS \nDirector, when turnover is that high it means supervisors have to carry a caseload or social workers \nwork more than 40 hours a week. Of the 23 social workers hired in Lenoir County, 16 were on \nwork-against status, meaning that applicants did not meet minimum standards set forth in state law \nfor the positions. The Director noted a marked increase in the numbers of work-against hires in \nthe past two years. \n277.  Numerous reports and audits—including some commissioned by DHHS itself—\nhave informed the agency that caseloads are too high and that, as a result, children are at a greater \nrisk of harm. The findings and recommendations have been replicated repeatedly over the past two \ndecades. Every report identifies unmanageably high caseloads as one of the most urgent problems \nfaced by the state and explicitly warns that high caseloads compromise caseworkers’ ability to \nkeep children safe. DHHS has failed to take meaningful steps to address the problem and appears \nno closer to escaping the cycle of crisis. \nIII.  Defendants’ Policies and Practices Cause Children to Languish in Foster Care \n278.  The primary goal of foster care is to provide a temporary, safe, and supportive \nenvironment for children while their parents work towards resolving the issues that led to their \nremoval or, if that is not practicable, that another permanent placement be found for the child. \nAgencies must provide services and support to parents to address the challenges they face, with \n  64\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 64 of 99\n\n \nthe ultimate aim of reunifying the child with their biological family when it is deemed safe and in \nthe child’s best interest. Alternatively, when children cannot be safely reunified with their parents, \nagencies must move expediently to ensure that children achieve permanency through adoption. \n279.  States must act swiftly to secure permanency for children because extended stays \nin foster care can disrupt a child’s sense of belonging and hinder their emotional, educational, and \nsocial development. \n280.  Data illustrates that North Carolina foster children are languishing in state custody. \nReentry rates in North Carolina dramatically increased from 2017 to 2021: 277% increase in \nchildren reentering care within 12 months of a prior episode (from 2.2% to 8.3%); 427% increase \nin children reentering care more than 12 months after a prior episode (from 1.1% to 5.8%). \n281.  North Carolina consistently ranks among the worst 10 states for reunification \n(45.6% in 2021) and among the top 4 states for guardianship (22.4% in 2021). Upon information \nand belief, county DSS routinely recommend that pre-adoptive foster parents accept guardianship \nof foster children, sometimes threatening removal if the foster parents do not. This saves DSS the \ntime and expense of going through the TPR process. But it denies the child real permanency and \ndenies guardians the financial assistance that comes with adoption.  \nIV.  Defendants Fail to Develop and Update Comprehensive Case Plans for Children and \nFamilies \n282.  DHHS and DSS are required under federal law to provide children in foster care \nwith a case plan that is reviewed regularly—at least once every six months—until a child’s case is \nresolved and the child leaves DHHS/DSS custody. These case plans focus on ways to resolve the \ncase and support the foster child, including plans to effectively engage family members and \nservices to address the family’s and the child’s needs. \n  65\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 65 of 99\n\n \n283.  DHHS fails to provide specific and updated case plans to children, instead resorting \nto “cookie cutter” case plans that are not regularly reviewed. Without effective case plans, foster \nchildren and their families go without the necessary services and support they require. \n284.  North Carolina has long known that it fails to provide timely and effective case \nplans, starting in 2015 when the CFSR found that North Carolina was not in substantial conformity \nwith the case review system, including Item 20 (written case plans), which was rated as an Area \nNeeding  Improvement.  This  was  because  “[i]nformation  in  the  statewide  assessment  and \nconfirmed during stakeholder interviews indicated that the state has no ability to monitor the \nfunctioning of this systemic factor item and that families are not consistently engaged in case \nplanning, especially non-custodial parents. Stakeholders expressed concern that parents were not \nprovided timely notification of case planning meetings and that diligent efforts to locate and serve \nnotice of the proceedings to non-custodial parents were not made. Stakeholders indicated that the \nplans are not reflective of the needs of the child and family.” \n285.  The CFSR also found that the agency made concerted efforts to involve children in \ncase planning on only 60% of cases reviewed, the agency made concerted efforts to involve \nmothers in case planning in only 67% of the cases reviewed and made concerted efforts to involve \nfathers in case planning in only 48% of the cases reviewed. The lack of involvement of families \nand children in case planning also leads to additional permanency issues and failures to obtain the \nsupportive services that foster children require.  \n286.  Similarly, a 2018 report by the Center of Support of Families, which was hired by \nNorth Carolina to review its child welfare system, found that “[c]hildren and parents are not \nconsistently engaged in the development of case plans.” Only 56% of foster cases reviewed rated \nas a strength for child and family engagement, and data suggested similar trends in engaging \n  66\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 66 of 99\n\n \nparents in case planning activities. Only 45% of counties held initial Child and Family Team \nMeetings (“CFTs”), and only 39% held ongoing CFTs.  \n287.  There is also little re-evaluation of case plans throughout the life of the case, which \nimpacts reunification and permanency efforts. For example, the Center of Support of Families \nreport found that Family Reunification Assessments were only being completed, reviewed and \nupdated approximately 50 percent of the time and that Family Services Agreements were not being \nconsistently reviewed and formally updated with parents. The report also noted that “the lack of \nconsistent quality face-to-face contact between workers and parents can also pose a barrier to \nestablishing relationships that help facilitate meaningful conversations with mothers and fathers \naround their changing needs and progress being made towards having their children returned to \nthem.” \n288.  The  lack  of  involvement  of  families  in  case  planning  and  the  lack  of \ncomprehensive, individualized, and updated assessments ensures that families and foster children \nare set up to fail. Case planning issues lead to longer times to permanency, to failures in \nreunification where reunification is possible, and to further emotional and physical harm to foster \nchildren. North Carolina has known about case planning issues for nearly a decade but has failed \nto adequately address them. \nV.  DHHS’s Failure to Establish a Reliable Information System Creates a Fragmented \nInformation Landscape And Places Foster Children at Risk of Serious Harm \n289.  Reliable information is a minimal requirement for all foster care systems. Reliable \ninformation in turn has certain minimal requirements: that it be full, complete, and comprehensive; \nthat it be accurate; and that it be available, usable, and readily accessible so that it can be relied \nupon. \n  67\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 67 of 99\n\n \n290.  Without a reliable information system, caseworkers are unable to perform critical \ntasks necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of foster children. \n291.  After  nearly  a  decade  ignoring  warnings  and  abdicating  its  leadership \nresponsibilities, DHHS has failed to establish a reliable case management system necessary to \ntrack the status and needs of children in foster care. \n292.  North Carolina’s 2015 CFSR revealed a defunct information system.  Following \nthe CFSR, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) placed DHHS on a three-\nyear Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), which set a goal for DHHS to “[e]nhance the statewide \ndata quality, collection and dissemination of information regarding services provided.” \n293.  In response, DHHS began development on a child welfare component of NC FAST, \nDHHS’s management software, called Program 4 (P4). But the development and rollout of P4 has \nproved disastrous. \n294.  The Social Services Regional Supervision and Collaboration Working Group and \nthe North Carolina Association of County Directors of Social Services both recommended that \nNorth Carolina reexamine plans to use P4 for child welfare case management. But DHHS ignored \nthese concerns and continued the rollout. \n295.  When issues persisted and counties protested, the General Assembly postponed \nimplementation of P4 and allowed counties to opt out. Of the 57 counties expected to adopt P4, \nmore than 40 counties opted out. As of 2020, “25 counties [were] using NC FAST for Intake and \nAssessment and [only] 11 pilot counties [were] using NC FAST for additional services such as In-\nHome Services and Permanency Planning.” That means 64 counties were not using NC FAST at \nall and were instead resorting to legacy computer systems and paper-based systems. In this \n  68\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 68 of 99\n\n \nfragmented landscape, data is often lost as children are moved between homes and institutions in \ndifferent counties. \n296.  DHHS’s failure to develop and implement a comprehensive electronic record and \ncase management system means that the case management problems identified over a decade ago \npersist today. Indeed, DHHS’s failures have exacerbated case management problems. Some \ncounties “are already exploring P4 alternatives including paper-based systems,” and others “are \npreparing to invest county funds to supplement their legacy systems with software that only \nsupports limited aspects of child welfare case management.” \n297.  North Carolina Senator Carl Ford expressed frustration after waiting more than a \ndecade and spending tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money on NC FAST, saying “We \njokingly call it NC Slow because it’s terrible . . .  It takes up too much time. And it just doesn’t \nwork, and we’ve wasted millions of dollars on it.’” North Carolina Senator Joyce Kraweic, \nchairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Health and Human Services, similarly \nexpressed frustration that “FedEx can track a package and tell you where it is every step of the \nway, and all about it . . . We can’t keep up with our children and where they are in NC Fast. And \nthere’s no excuse for it.” \n298.  DHHS’s failures place North Carolina’s federal funding in jeopardy, turning an \nalready perilous financial situation into a catastrophe. NC FAST was supposed to address these \ndata collection, entry, and reporting problems, but DHHS’s development and implementation of \nP4 has caused even greater fragmentation. \n299.  And DHHS knows or should know that its failure to secure and retain federal \nfunding via compliance with federal law exacerbates financial problems and places children at \nsignificant risk of serious and irreparable harm.  \n  69\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 69 of 99\n\n \nVI.  DHHS Failure to Monitor and Supervise Licensed Facilities Places Foster Children \nat Risk of Harm \n300.  DHHS is responsible for monitoring licensed homes and facilities. State law grants \nDHHS the power and responsibility to periodically review licensees to determine compliance with \nthe rules (§ 131D-10.3); to collect data on the use of restraints in residential child-care facilities (§ \n131D-10.5A); to conduct criminal background checks and determine if caretakers are fit to care \nfor foster children (§ 131D-10.3A); and to exercise its powers to protect the health and safety of \nchildren in facilities (§ 131D-10.6). \n301.  DHHS’s Division of Social Services (NC DSS) is responsible for overseeing foster \nhomes (G.S. 131D-10.2(8); NCAC 70E) and residential child-care facilities (G.S. 131D-10.2(8); \nNCAC  70I).  DHHS’s  Division  of  Health  Services  Regulation  (DHSR)  is  responsible  for \noverseeing residential treatment facilities (G.S. 122C-3(14); NCAC 27G.1300; NCAC 27G.1700; \nNCAC 27G.1800; NCAC 27G.1900). \n302.  The North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) requires DHSR to revoke a \nlicense whenever it finds: there has been failure to comply with G.S. 122C; there has been failure \nto comply with rules promulgated under G.S. 122C; and such failure to comply endangers the \nhealth, safety or welfare of the individuals in the facility (NCAC 27G .0405(d)). \n303.  Despite  these  powers  and  duties,  DHHS  does  not  regularly  inspect  licensed \nfacilities, or otherwise maintain any meaningful oversight of its licensees. \n304.  DHHS routinely fails to take any meaningful action when safety violations are \nuncovered. It issues citations, but almost never fines or suspensions. \n305.  Unlike  NC  DSS,  DHSR  publishes  its  inspection  reports.  The  DHSR  reports \n(“Statements of Deficiencies”) from 2018-2023 covering 205 facilities licensed by DHSR under \nNCAC 27G.1300, .1700, and .1800 reveal serious and chronic safety problems. \n  70\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 70 of 99\n\n \n306.  Of the 205 facilities reviewed, 57% (106) were cited for medical requirements \nviolations. Some facilities were cited multiple times, year after year. For example, Pearl’s Angel \nCare, Inc., a residential treatment facility in Cumberland County, was cited for violations of \nmedication requirements every year from 2019-2022. Children on psychotropic medications are \nbeing underdosed and overdosed, they are not provided their medication at the prescribed intervals, \nsome do not receive their medication at all, others receive medication that a doctor has not \nprescribed. Medications are stored improperly, and medical records are often pre-filled, incorrect, \nor left blank entirely. Medication issues are not properly reported to the child’s doctor, and the \nindividuals administering the medication lack the qualifications to administer such medication. \n307.  Of the 205 facilities reviewed, 40% (82) were cited for violations of minimum \nstaffing requirements. In these understaffed facilities, children are left unsupervised and are placed \nat significant risk of harm.  \n308.  Despite these facilities’ numerous and repeated violations of the NCAC, DHSR \nfails to take any meaningful enforcement action against them. Of the 205 facilities reviewed, less \nthan 1% received “penalties or serious administrative actions against their license.” \n309.  At most, the facilities are required to submit to a corrective action plan that contains \nno accountability measures. Due to the lack of any meaningful accountability, these facilities often \ncontinue to repeat these violations year after year. \n310.  DHSR’s lack of enforcement seriously endangers the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe children in these facilities. Moreover, DHHS’s knee-jerk response to news reports—that \nCounty DSS, not DHHS, are responsible—reveals that DHHS has made a deliberate choice not to \nconduct ongoing oversight based on its legally erroneous position that County DSS are responsible \n  71\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 71 of 99\n\n \nfor monitoring licensed facilities. DHHS is fully aware that its failure to monitor licensees with \nlong histories of noncompliance places foster children at serious risk of significant harm. \nVII.  DHHS’s Non-Enforcement Policy Places Foster Children at Significant Risk of  Harm \n311.  The  core  responsibility  of  supervisory  agencies  is  to  establish  performance \nrequirements, monitor compliance with the requirements, and enforce the requirements. North \nCarolina law requires DHHS to establish and implement mandatory performance requirements for \ncounty DSS child welfare services, and to develop and implement corrective action plans when \ncounty DSS do not meet those requirements. G.S. § 108A-74(a2), (a3), (c), (j). \n312.  However,  DHHS  has  established  only  one  statewide  mandatory  performance \nrequirement for county DSS child welfare services: that 95% of all foster youth have a face-to-\nface visit with the social worker each month, which is also a federal requirement which the agency \nis responsible for reporting on. DHHS has not established any additional mandatory performance \nrequirements. \n313.  Even  if  DHHS  developed  meaningful  performance  requirements,  those \nrequirements would go unenforced because DHHS has adopted a formal policy abandoning the \nuse of the statutorily mandated corrective action policy. In its 2021 Oversight Report to the Joint \nLegislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, DHHS announced that “[a]s part \nof encouraging capacity-building, DHHS will no longer enforce ‘corrective action’ upon counties. \nIt will instead focus on encouraging county-level ‘development plans’ that analyze and solve \nproblems through deliberate use of evidence.” DHHS reaffirmed this policy in its 2023 Oversight \nReport. \n314.  Instead of establishing meaningful performance requirements and taking corrective \nactions, DHHS has adopted a custom and practice of assuming direct control over child welfare \nservices only after the substantial risk of harm has escalated to actual irreparable harm.  \n  72\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 72 of 99\n\n \n315.  For example, in May 2022, DHHS assumed direct responsibility for Bertie DSS \nchild welfare services based on “systematic lack of adequate training, supervision, and capacity to \ndeliver  appropriate  child  welfare  services  in  accordance  with  law,  rule,  and  policy,”  and \ndeficiencies that posed “a substantial threat to children’s safety and welfare in Bertie County.” \nThis was after a DHHS review only five months earlier purportedly concluded that Bertie DSS \nwas adequately administering the child welfare system. \n316.  No child welfare staff, including the supervisor and director, had completed the \ntraining required for their roles. Staff were unable to “describe how the concepts of safety, well-\nbeing, and permanence are integrated from the point of Intake to Adoption,” “articulate the basics \nof child welfare practice,” or “describe a rationale for their decision making.” There was also “a \ncomplete absence of leadership over child welfare services.” Additionally, documentation in all \nrecords was “minimal to non-existent,” case decisions were not supported by information or \ndocumentation, and case decisions were made without guidance or input from a supervisor. \n317.  The Bertie DSS hotline was essentially nonfunctional. Bertie DSS did not have an \nintake schedule to ensure that calls were taken, and one community member reported that “they \nhad tried calling in a report every day for a week with no response.” Staff did not log intake reports, \ndid not track screening decisions, and did not record and maintain screened-out reports. “Most \nintakes were missing crucial information, screening tools were not complete, timeframes were not \nassigned to all cases, and most intakes did not have the required two-level screening.” \n318.  DHHS’s inability to identify these obvious and systemic deficiencies in the years \nand months preceding its assumption of control over Bertie county reflects systemic disfunction \nin its supervision and monitoring of county DSS. \n  73\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 73 of 99\n\n \n319.  A supervisory agency that waits for tragedy to strike before intervening is not \nperforming its most basic responsibility. DHHS’s failure to fulfill its supervisory role threatens the \nsafety and wellbeing of North Carolina’s foster children. DHHS officials were aware of these \nproblems and the risks they posed to foster children. DHHS’s decisions to forgo mandatory \nperformance metrics and corrective action plans delayed intervention until after children suffered \nserious irreparable harm. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSubstantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n320.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n321.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to provide reasonable care to, and to protect from harm, a child with whom it has \nformed a special relationship. \n322.  The foregoing actions, inactions, and omissions of Defendants constitute a policy, \npattern, practice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional \njudgment, is objectively unreasonable under the facts and circumstances, and amounts to deliberate \nindifference to the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests of all of the members of \nthe General Class. Defendants are well aware and should have been aware of the policies and \npractices in place, which prevent these class members from receiving adequate protection from \nphysical and psychological harm after the State has formed a special relationship with them. As a \nresult, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the class of children to whom the state owes \na special duty, children who have a special relationship with Defendants, including wards of \nDHHS, have been, and are, at risk of being deprived of their substantive due process rights \nconferred upon them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n  74\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 74 of 99\n\n \n323.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment and repeated maltreatment, while under the \nprotective supervision of the State; \nb.  the right to protection from unnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional \nwellbeing once the State has established a special relationship with that child; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm; \nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the purpose \nof government custody; \ne.  the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the \npurpose to be served by taking a child into government custody; \nf.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions of \ngovernment custody; \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n324.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n325.  Plaintiffs and the class members they represent are in Defendants’ custody or \nguardianship  and  are  wholly  dependent  on  Defendants  to  provide  for  their  basic  physical, \npsychological,  and emotional needs, and to protect them from physical, psychological, and \nemotional harm. \n326.  Children frequently and foreseeably suffer physical, psychological, and emotional \nharm in DCS custody. They suffer harm in part because, in sharp contrast with the ideal of a stable \nand permanent home and family, they are continually shuttled between temporary and often non-\nfamilial custodial arrangements. Professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \n  75\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 75 of 99\n\n \nDefendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their care in stable, permanent \nhomes and families. \n327.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment and amounts \nto deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the General \nClass. \n328.  By failing to take all reasonable efforts toward fostering familial association and \nsecuring a permanent home and family for the named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent, Defendants have failed to protect them from psychologically and emotionally harmful \nshuttling between temporary living arrangements. \n329.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class have \nbeen, and are at risk of being, deprived of the right to familial association and reasonable protection \nfrom psychological and emotional harm while in Defendants’ custody, in violation of the First \nAmendment’s right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n \n330.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n331.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom of depriving the named Plaintiffs and the classes they represent of the \nrights contained in the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoptive and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, to: \n  76\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 76 of 99\n\n \na.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to achieve safe \nand appropriate foster care placements in the least restrictive and most family-like \nsetting, closest to their home community, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A), and; \nb.  a case review system in which the status of the child is reviewed no less frequently \nthan every six months by a court, or person responsible for case management, for \npurposes  of  determining  the  safety  of  the  child,  continuing  necessity  and \nappropriateness of the placement, extent of compliance with their permanency plan \nand projected date of permanency, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C). \nc.  a written case plan that contains the health records of the child, including the child’s \nknown  medical  problems,  the  child’s  medications,  and  other  relevant  health \ninformation concerning the child, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(C)(v)-(vii). \nd.  a procedure for assuring that a child’s health record is reviewed and updated, and \nthat a child’s updated health record is provided to the foster parent or foster care \nprovider at the time of placement, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(D). \ne.  In the case of a child with respect to whom the permanency plan is placement with \na relative, a description of the steps the agency has taken to determine that it is not \nappropriate for the child to be returned home or adopted, the reasons for any \nseparation of siblings, and the reasons why a permanent placement with the relative \nis in the child’s best interests. 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(F). \nf.  A plan for ensuring the educational stability of the child while in foster care. 42 \nU.S.C. § 675(1)(G). \ng.  For each child in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, DSS (i) petition \nto  terminate  the  parental  rights  of  the  child’s  parents,  subject  to  statutory \n  77\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 77 of 99\n\n \nexceptions; and (ii) concurrently identifies, recruits, processes, and approves a \nqualified family for an adoption, or documents compelling reasons for determining \nthat filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child. 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 675(5)(E). \n332.  These provisions of the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, are clearly intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \nrepresent; the rights conferred are neither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence; \nand the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n333.  Defendants have been aware, should have been aware, are aware, and should be \naware of all of the deprivations complained of herein, and Defendants have been deliberately \nindifferent to such conduct, failing to take steps to abate the risk of harm as a reasonable official \nwould. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n334.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n335.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities. \n336.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,  developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2)  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DHHS. \n  78\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 78 of 99\n\n \n337.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51. Defendant Kody Kinsley is sued in his official capacities as the state official \nresponsible for supervising North Carolina programs and activities related to foster care services. \n338.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n339.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2). \n340.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n341.  Accordingly, DHHS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity \nto access foster care services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as it provides to children \nwithout disabilities in its custody. \n342.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \n  79\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 79 of 99\n\n \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.”  28  C.F.R.  § \n35.130(b)(7). \n343.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(2); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n344.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings and subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their disabilities, as set forth above, and \nwill continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance \nwith the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 Against County Defendants \n(Monell v. Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658) \n  \n345.  Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference all allegations of this Complaint as if \nfully set out herein. \nMecklenburg County and Mecklenburg DSS-YFS \n \n346.  The Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners created a Consolidated Health \nand Human Services Agency (Mecklenburg HHS). Mecklenburg County Department of Social \nServices-Youth and Family Services (Mecklenburg DSS-YFS) is a department under Mecklenburg \nHHS.  The  Board  of  Commissioners  exercises  oversight  over  all  county  programs  and \ndepartments.  \n347.  The Director of Mecklenburg DSS-YFS is the final policymaker for all policies and \nprocedures established to govern the operations and activities of Mecklenburg DSS-YFS.  \n  80\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 80 of 99\n\n \n348.  Kim Henderson is the current Director of Mecklenburg DSS.  \n349.  Mecklenburg County’s action, inactions, and/or omissions—including, but not \nlimited to, the failure to recruit, retain, and train caseworkers and foster parents—manifest \ndeliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and substantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not \nlimited to, the risk of placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive \ntimely or appropriate treatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly \ninstitutionalized. \n350.  Mecklenburg  County  maintains  a  policy,  custom,  or  pattern  of  practice  of \ntransporting foster children to hospital emergency departments for mental health treatment and \nletting those children languish at the hospital for days and weeks beyond medical necessity because \nDSS is unable or unwilling to find an appropriate placement for the child.  Often, these emergency \ndepartments are located in hospitals that are not equipped to address mental health needs or provide \nadequate pediatric care.  Hospital staff cannot adequately supervise these children or prevent them \nfrom running away.  \n351.  During these hospital stays, children often do not receive required educational or \nsocial services. \n352.  As  a  result  of  Mecklenburg  DSS’  failure  to  provide  necessary  medical  and \neducation  services  to  children  held  in  hospitals,  the  plaintiffs’  mental  and  physical  health \ndeteriorates, and their chances of placement stability and permanency diminish. \n353.  This policy, custom, or pattern of practice violates N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-142.2. \n354.  Mecklenburg County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, one \n  81\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 81 of 99\n\n \nin three children in the custody of Mecklenburg DSS had four or more placements. For children \nages 6-12, 37% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, 58% had four or more \nplacements. \n355.  Mecklenburg County also ranks among the worst jurisdictions (nationally and \nstatewide) for permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency \nwithin 12 months of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between July 1, 2023 and \nJune 30, 2024, Mecklenburg County averaged 26% permanency within 12 months. \n356.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Mecklenburg DSS. \n357.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand  resources.  In  fiscal  year  2023,  Mecklenburg  DSS-YFS  “experienced  significant  staff \nturnover…” And in fiscal year 2023, “experienced a decrease in placement resources for children \nin YFS custody, which has resulted in children remaining overnight in the DSS office, a hotel, or \npartner facility.” “Since July 2022, an average of 6 children per month have experienced an \novernight stay in an unlicensed arrangement. Some children stay for as little as one to two nights, \nand other have stayed several weeks.” “YFS needs increased capacity for licensed foster homes \nand emergency placements.” \nGaston County and Gaston DSS \n \n358.  The Gaston County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. \n359.  Gaston County Board of Commissioners created a Consolidated Health and Human \nServices Agency (Gaston DHHS). Gaston County Department of Social Services (Gaston DSS) is \n  82\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 82 of 99\n\n \na department under Gaston DHHS. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all \ncounty programs and departments.  \n360.  The Director of Gaston DSS is the final policymaker for all policies and procedures \nestablished to govern the operations and activities of Gaston DSS.  \n361.  Angela Karchmer is the current Director of Gaston DSS.  \n362.  Gaston County’s action, inactions, and/or omissions—including, but not limited to, \nthe  failure  to  recruit,  retain,  and  train  caseworkers  and  foster  parents—manifest  deliberate \nindifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nsubstantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not limited to, the risk \nof placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive timely or appropriate \ntreatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly institutionalized. \n363.  As of May 2022, Gaston County had about 400 children in foster care and only 50 \nlicensed foster homes. Consequently, foster children are housed in DSS offices, placed out-of-\ncounty, and shuffled between various placements. \n364.  Gaston County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 42% \nof children in the custody of Gaston DSS had four or more placements. For children ages 6-12, \n52% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, 57% had four or more placements. \n365.  Gaston County also ranks among the worst jurisdictions (nationally and statewide) \nfor permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency within 12 \nmonths of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between July 1, 2023 and June 30, \n2024, Gaston County averaged 21% permanency within 12 months. \n  83\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 83 of 99\n\n \n366.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Gaston DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal \nrights. \nJohnston County and Johnston DSS \n \n367.  The Johnston County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all county programs \nand departments. \n368.  Johnston County Department of Social Services (Johnston DSS) is a department \nunder the Johnston County Board of Commissioners. \n369.  The  Director  of  Johnston  DSS  is  the  final  policymaker  for  all  policies  and \nprocedures established to govern the operations and activities of Johnston DSS.  \n370.  Christine Dowdell is the current Director of Johnston DSS.  \n371.  Johnston County’s action, inactions, and/or omissions—including, but not limited \nto, the failure to recruit, retain, and train caseworkers and foster parents—manifest deliberate \nindifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nsubstantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not limited to, the risk \nof placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive timely or appropriate \ntreatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly institutionalized. \n372.  Johnston County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 24% \nof children in the custody of Johnston DSS had four or more placements. For children ages 6-12, \n34% had four or more placements.  \n  84\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 84 of 99\n\n \n373.  Johnston  County  also  ranks  among  the  worst  jurisdictions  (nationally  and \nstatewide) for rates of reentry. The national average for children reentering foster care within 12 \nmonths of discharge is 8%, and the state average is 4%. Between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, \nJohnston County averaged 18% reentry to foster care within 12 months. \n374.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and impermanence compromises the \nhealth and safety of children in the custody of Johnston DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal \nrights. \n375.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of foster \nhomes and staff. The Johnstonian News reported in July 2024 that Johnston County has over 300 \nfoster children, about 30 foster homes, and of those 30, only 8 with open beds. Consequently, many \nfoster children in Johnston County are forced to sleep in DSS offices, a problem that has become \nso pervasive that local organizations have attempted to fill the gap. When asked to comment on \nthe sexual assault of a child staying in a DSS office, former interim Director of Johnston DSS, Ben \nRose, described vacancies as high and turnover as constant. The combination of unmanageable \ncaseloads and turnover creates a cycle of crisis where children in Johnston County fall through the \ncracks. \nHarnett County and Harnett DSS \n \n376.  The Harnett County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all county programs \nand departments. \n  85\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 85 of 99\n\n \n377.  Harnett County Department of Social Services (Harnett DSS) is a department under \nthe Harnett County Board of Commissioners charged with administering the county’s foster care \nsystem.  \n378.  The Director of Harnett DSS is the final policymaker for all policies and procedures \nestablished to govern the operations and activities of Harnett DSS.  \n379.  Paul Polinski is the current Director of Harnett DSS.  \n380.  Harnett County’s action, inactions, and/or omissions—including, but not limited \nto, the failure to recruit, retain, and train caseworkers and foster parents—manifest deliberate \nindifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nsubstantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not limited to, the risk \nof placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive timely or appropriate \ntreatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly institutionalized. \n381.  Harnett County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 21% \nof children in the custody of Harnett DSS had four or more placements.  \n382.  Harnett County also ranks among the worst jurisdictions (nationally and statewide) \nfor permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency within 12 \nmonths of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between FY2022-2023, Harnett \nCounty averaged 11% permanency within 12 months. The median time a child spends in the \ncustody of Harnett DSS is 593 days, over 100 more days than the state average. \n383.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Harnett DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal \nrights. \n  86\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 86 of 99\n\n \n384.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand resources. Harnett County’s FY2022-2023 Approved Budget “Additional staff would ensure \na more proportionate distribution of caseloads to staff. This would decrease safety risks to children \nin the community and would greatly improve worker morale. CPS has a high turnover rate due to \nthe demands of the job to include higher than recommended caseload sizes.” Harnett County’s \nFY2023-2024 Approved Budget calls for hiring additional DSS supervisors “due to the increase \nin caseloads,  complexity of cases and multiple new standards and requirements. The State \nrecommends one supervisor for five social workers. Harnett County currently has one supervisor \nfor seven social workers. The number of children in foster care continues to increase. The lack of \nadequate supervisors could lead to standards being missed and the possibility that families and \nchildren are not receiving adequate services.” “DSS currently has seven vehicles that are shared \namong 45 social workers.” \nDavidson County and Davidson County DSS \n \n385.  The Davidson County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all county programs \nand departments. \n386.  Davidson County Department of Social Services (Davidson DSS) is a department \nunder Davidson County. \n387.  The  Director  of  Davidson  DSS  is  the  final  policymaker  for  all  policies  and \nprocedures established to govern the operations and activities of Davidson DSS.  \n388.  Patricia Baker is the current Director of Davidson DSS.  \n  87\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 87 of 99\n\n \n389.  Davidson County’s action, inactions, and/or omissions—including, but not limited \nto, the failure to recruit, retain, and train caseworkers and foster parents—manifest deliberate \nindifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nsubstantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not limited to, the risk \nof placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive timely or appropriate \ntreatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly institutionalized. \n390.  Davidson County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 38% \nof children in the custody of Davidson DSS had four or more placements (6% worse than the state \naverage). For children ages 6-12, 49% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, \n75% had four or more placements. \n391.  Davidson  County  also  ranks  among  the  worst  jurisdictions  for  permanency \noutcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency within 12 months of \nentering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between FY2022-2023 2022, Davidson County \naveraged 29% permanency within 12 months. \n392.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Davidson DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal \nrights. \n393.  Davidson County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of failing to \nprovide necessary services and mental health treatment for children in their custody. Davidson \nDSS  substantially  departs  from  professional  judgment  from  clinicians  and  other  health \nprofessionals as to the needs of the children in their care, and does not place children in the least \nrestrictive environment appropriate to their needs. \n  88\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 88 of 99\n\n \n394.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand resources. As of August 29, 2024, Davidson DSS only had five caseworkers out of fourteen \navailable positions, a vacancy rate of 64%. Those five caseworkers were responsible for handling \nover 180 foster children. Licensed foster parents are closing their homes and dropping their foster \nlicenses out of frustration with Davidson DSS. \nRockingham County and Rockingham County DSS \n \n395.  The Rockingham County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. \n396.  Rockingham County Board of Commissioners created a Consolidated Health and \nHuman Services Agency (Rockingham County DHHS). Rockingham County Department of \nSocial Services (Rockingham County DSS) is a department under Rockingham County DHHS. \nThe Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all county programs and departments.  \n397.  The Director of Rockingham County DSS is the final policymaker for all policies \nand procedures established to govern the operations and activities of Rockingham County DSS.  \n398.  Carye E. Dickerson is the current Director of Rockingham County DSS.  \n399.  Rockingham County’s  action, inactions, and/or  omissions—including, but not \nlimited to, the failure to recruit, retain, and train caseworkers and foster parents—manifest \ndeliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and substantially increase the serious risk of harm to Plaintiffs—including, but not \nlimited to, the risk of placement disruption and instability, the risk that children will not receive \ntimely or appropriate treatment, and the risk that children will be unnecessarily and unjustly \ninstitutionalized. \n  89\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 89 of 99\n\n \n400.  Rockingham County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 30% \nof children in the custody of Rockingham County DSS had four or more placements. For children \nages 6-12, 38% had four or more placements; and for children ages 13-17, 31% had four or more \nplacements.  \n401.  The vicious cycle of placement instability compromises the health and safety of \nchildren in the custody of Rockingham County DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ federal rights. \n402.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand resources. For example, media coverage in February 2023 highlighted the shortage of foster \nparents and foster homes in Rockingham County, which has led to children sleeping in DSS \noffices. \nRandolph County and Randolph County DSS \n403.  The Randolph County Board of Commissioners is charged with providing policy \ndirection for the administration of county government and providing for the efficient operation of \ngovernment services. The Board of Commissioners exercises oversight over all county programs \nand departments.  \n404.  Randolph County Department of Social Services (Randolph DSS) is a department \nunder Randolph County.  \n405.  The Director of Randolph County DSS is the final policymaker for all policies and \nprocedures established to govern the operations and activities of Randolph County DSS.  \n406.  Tracie Murphy is the current Director of Randolph County DSS.  \n407.

Randolph County maintains a policy, custom, or pattern of practice of shuttling \nchildren between placements with dangerous frequency. Between July 2022 and June 2023, 51% \nof children in the custody of Randolph County DSS had four or more placements. By comparison, \n32% of children in DSS custody in North Carolina experienced four or more placements. For \nchildren ages 6-12 in Randolph County DSS custody, 58% had four or more placements; and for \nchildren ages 13-17, 55% had four or more placements. The median time a child spends in the \ncustody of Randolph County DSS is approximately 549 days. \n409.  Randolph  County  also  ranks  among  the  worst  jurisdictions  (nationally  and \nstatewide) for permanency outcomes. The national average for children discharged to permanency \nwithin 12 months of entering care is 41%, and the state average is 28%. Between FY2023-2024, \nRandolph County averaged a mere 7% permanency within 12 months. \n410.  The vicious cycle of placement instability and delayed permanency compromises \nthe health and safety of children in the custody of Randolph County DSS in violation of plaintiffs’ \nfederal rights. \n411.  At the root of these placement and permanency problems are a severe lack of staff \nand resources. For example, according to the Randolph County DSS Annual Report Fiscal Year \n2020-2021, the Child Protective Services In-Home program had “a 50% turnover rate and a lack \nof qualified applicants applying for vacant positions, resulting in an inability to fill positions in a \ntimely manner.” These staffing shortages create “challenges with filing noncompliance petitions \n  91\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 91 of 99\n\n \nfor cases opened for services more than 180 days, with little to no progress toward case closure.” \nThe number of foster care children in the custody of DSS rose in the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which \nresulted in added strain on the Department, including “increased caseloads, increased court time \nand preparation of court reports, extended work hours for social workers, and increased placements \nand placement disruptions.” A study of Randolph County DSS that was published in November \n2022 showed that “foster care has grown by 82 percent in Randolph County since 2016.” The \nnumber of staff and placement providers has not kept pace with this increase. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nNorth Carolina Social Services Law \n(Asserted by County Subclass Against County Defendants) \n \n412.  Plaintiffs adopt and incorporate by reference all allegations of this Complaint as if \nfully set out herein. \n413.

Require that Defendants ensure that all children whose case plan identifies a need \nfor services and/or treatment timely receive those services and/or treatment; \ni.  Require Defendants to file and proceed with a timely petition to free a child for \nadoption when the child’s permanency plan is adoption, unless the child’s case plan \ndocuments show that doing so is not in the child’s best interest or that the child has \na statutory exemption from this requirement; \n  94\nCase 3:24-cv-00783-FDW-DCK     Document 37     Filed 11/22/24     Page 94 of 99\n\n \nj.
