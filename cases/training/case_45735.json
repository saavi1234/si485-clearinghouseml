Plaintiffs SisterReach, Inc. and Midwest Access Coalition, Inc. (collectively, &ldquo;SisterReach&rdquo;) assist young people in Tennessee in obtaining legal abortion care and other services. On June 26, 2024, SisterReach filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee Western Division against the Attorney General of Tennessee and several District Attorney Generals (collectively, &ldquo;the Attorney General&rdquo;). SisterReach alleged violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment as the language of the bill was allegedly vague, overbroad, and inhibited freedom of expression and association. Represented by private counsel and The Lawyering Project, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. This case was assigned to Chief Judge Sheryl H. Lipman.</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2024, the court denied SisterReach&rsquo;s motion for a temporary restraining order; it did not offer any reasoning for its decision.

Indifferent to the extraordinary impact of denying a young person1 access to legal \nabortion care, S.B. 1971(1)(a), Gen. Assemb., Sec. Reg. Sess. (Tn. 2023) (โSB 1971โ) seeks to \ncriminalize a wide range of actors, including Plaintiffs, for helping young people leave Tennessee \nto obtain legal abortions in other states without written, notarized parental consent to do so.  \n \n1 This complaint uses โyoung personโ as shorthand for an unemancipated minor under the age of \neighteen. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 3 of 40    PageID 3\n2.  In  incendiary  fashion,  SB  1971  brands  non-profit  groups  like  Plaintiffs  as \ntraffickers, when in fact they are longstanding, caring allies who serve young people to express \nrespect for and solidarity with them. \n3.  Contrary to fearmongering over youth and abortion, most young people involve a \nparent in decisions about whether to continue a pregnancy. SB 1971 would punish young people \nin Tennessee who have confided in a parent but cannot furnish the written, notarized parental \nconsent. SB 1971 would also punish young people in Tennessee with absent, incapacitated, \nabusive, or unsupportive parents; young people in state custody; and other system-involved youth.  \n4.  SB 1971 is so unclear that those dedicated to helping young people in Tennessee \nsecure legal abortion care cannot determine when their support would become a crime. As such, \nSB 1971 gives prosecutors unbridled discretion to target anyone whom they disfavor. What is \nmore, SB 1971 stifles helpersโ protected expression because the expression concerns legal \nabortion as opposed to any other legal healthcare, and because the speech concerns expanding \nrather than restricting legal abortion.  \n5.  Consequently, Plaintiffs, both of whom would continue helping young people in \nTennessee obtain legal abortion care in other states but for SB 1971, seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief from SB 1971โs vague, overbroad, and otherwise unconstitutional provisions.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n6.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. This is an action to  \nenforce civil and constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the United States \nConstitution. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 4 of 40    PageID 4\n7.  This Court has authority to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201, 2202, and 1343, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, and the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of the Court. \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(1) because certain \nDefendants, who are government officers sued in their official capacities, perform their official \nduties in this district. Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in this district and \nPlaintiff SisterReach is located in Memphis, Tennessee. \nPARTIES \n \nI.  Plaintiffs \n9.  SisterReach, Inc. (โSisterReachโ) is a Memphis-based non-profit organization with \na mission to empower the people it serves to lead healthy lives, raise healthy families, and live in \nhealthy and sustainable communities. It supports the reproductive autonomy of women and teens \nof color, poor and rural women, LGBTQIA+ people, and their families through the framework of \nreproductive justice. Reproductive and sexual justice organizations operate with the core principles \nthat people have the human rights to decide if and when they will have a baby and the conditions \nunder which they will give birth, adopt, or parent; to decide their option for preventing or ending \na  pregnancy;  to  parent  the  children  they  already  have  in  safe  environments  and  healthy \ncommunities without fear of violence from individuals or the state; to bodily autonomy free from \nall forms of reproductive oppression; to express their sexuality and spirituality without violence or \nshame; and to a quality of life that is sustainable before, during, and beyond their ability to give \nbirth or parent. SisterReach is the only reproductive justice organization in Tennessee. Among \nother programs, SisterReach operates the Tennessee Reproductive Access Fund, which pays for \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 5 of 40    PageID 5\nlegal abortion care for Tennesseans so they can put their own resources towards the other costs of \nobtaining that care, including transportation, lodging, meals, and childcare. \n10.  SisterReach provides such support to young people in Tennessee seeking legal \nabortions in other states regardless of whether they have supportive parents. SisterReach plans to \nstop that help on July 1, 2024, unless this Court declares or orders that SB 1971 cannot be enforced \nagainst it. \n11.  Through this help, SisterReach conveys that young people in Tennessee deserve to \nmake deeply personal decisions for themselves, including whether to continue a pregnancy and \nparent a child, and be unequivocally supported in doing so.  \n12.  SisterReach belongs to a coalition and seeks to achieve collective power through \neducation, service, advocacy, volunteer mobilization, and allied partnerships. \n13.  SisterReach sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its staff and volunteers. \n14.  Midwest Access Coalition, Inc. (โMidwest Access Coalitionโ or โMACโ) is a \nnonprofit organization based in Illinois working towards a world where all people can access safe, \nfree, and legal abortion care wherever they live. To that end, MAC provides people information \nabout and referrals for legal abortion care. MAC also helps people obtain legal abortion care by \ncoordinating and funding their transportation, lodging, meals, and childcare.2  \n \n2 Organizations that provide such support are often referred to as โpractical support \norganizations.โ \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 6 of 40    PageID 6\n15.  MAC provides such support to young people in Tennessee seeking legal abortions \nin other states regardless of whether they have parental consent. MAC plans to stop that support \non July 1, 2024, unless this Court declares or orders that SB 1971 cannot be enforced against it.  \n16.  Through these activities, MAC expresses that young people in Tennessee are \nworthy of respect and community. Through these activities, MAC conveys protest and defiance of \npoliticiansโ attempts to impose pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood on young people and to \nstigmatize young peopleโs decisions to reject or delay those things.  \n17.  MAC  belongs  to  a  coalition  and  seeks  to  achieve  collective  power  through \neducation, service, advocacy, volunteer mobilization, and allied partnerships.  \n18.  MAC sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its staff and volunteers.  \nII.  Defendants  \n \n19.  Defendant Jonathan Skrmetti is the Attorney General of Tennessee. As Attorney \nGeneral, Defendant Skrmetti is responsible for defending Tennessee laws against constitutional \nchallenges. See Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 8-6-109(b)(9). He is also empowered to petition the Tennessee \nSupreme Court to appoint a district attorney general pro tem to enforce SB 1971 where an elected \ndistrict attorney general declines to enforce the statute. See Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 8-7-106(a)(2). And \nhe has expressed a willingness to engage in criminal, civil, or administrative investigations or \nproceedings against helpers of abortion patients.3 โEnjoining a statewide official . . . based on his \n \n3 See Anita Wadhwani, Tennessee AG asserts right to out-of-state abortion, transgender care \nmedical records, Tennessee Lookout (July 18, 2023), \nhttps://tennesseelookout.com/2023/07/18/tennessee-ag-asserts-right-to-out-of-state-abortion-\ntransgender-care-medical-records/ (joining eighteen other attorneys general in opposing a \nDepartment of Health and Human Services rule that would prohibit uses and disclosures of \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 7 of 40    PageID 7\nobligation to enforce a law is appropriate when there is a realistic possibility the official will take \nlegal or administrative actions against the plaintiff's interests.โ Russell v.

And every pregnancy-related complication, including severe \nnausea and vomiting, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia, is more common among patients \ngiving birth than among those ending a pregnancy.5  \n54.  Labor and delivery present their own medical risks and burdens. Labor can last \nanywhere from hours to days, be extremely painful, involve tearing leading to incontinence and \nsexual dysfunction, be mentally taxing and even traumatic, entail profuse bleeding, and end in a \ncaesarean section, which is a major abdominal surgery.6 \n55.  Notably, the risk of death associated with childbirth is twelve times higher than that \nassociated with abortion.7 The United States has a significantly higher rate of maternal mortality \nthan other developed nations.8 In 2022, 817 women and girls died of maternal causes.9 And Black \nwomen and girls die from maternal causes at a substantially higher rate than White women and \ngirls.

In contrast to continuing a pregnancy through childbirth, abortion is one of the \nsafest medical interventions provided in the United States today. Complications associated with \nabortion are exceedingly rare: nationwide, fewer than one-quarter (0.23%) of 1% of all abortion \npatients experience a complication that requires hospitalization, surgery, or a blood transfusion.17  \n59.  Three methods of abortion are commonly used in the United States: medication \nabortion,  aspiration  abortion,  and  D&E  abortion.  Medication  abortion  involves  providing \nmedications that end a pregnancy and cause the uterus to expel its contents. This method may be \nused from the start of a pregnancy through eleven weeks gestation, as measured from the first day \nof a patientโs last menstrual period (โlmpโ). Aspiration abortion involves using suction to empty \nthe contents of the uterus. This method is typically used from six weeks lmp through fourteen to \nsixteen weeks lmp. D&E abortion involves using suction and medical instruments to empty the \ncontents of the uterus. This method is generally used beginning at fourteen to sixteen weeks lmp. \n60.  Although  abortion  is  extremely  safe  throughout  pregnancy,  its  complexity, \nduration, costs, and medical risks increase with gestational age. To illustrate, the average costs of \na medication abortion, first-trimester aspiration abortion, and second-trimester abortion are $568, \n$625, and between $715 and $2,000, respectively.18  \n61.  Further,  each  day  that  someone  remains  pregnant  against  their  will  can  be \nagonizing, particularly if the pregnancy resulted from abuse. \n \n17 Ushma D.

Young People in Tennessee Face Daunting Challenges to Obtaining Legal \nAbortion Care and Avoiding Compelled Pregnancy, Childbirth, and \nParenthoodโEspecially After Dobbs  \n \n62.  Tennessee has the thirteenth-highest poverty rate (13.28%) in the country and \ntwelfth-highest child poverty rate (17.34%) in the country.19  \n63.  Young people in Tennessee have always needed abortions. In fact, a fiscal analysis \nof SB 1971 found that between 2019 and 2020, before Tennesseeโs abortion ban took effect, over \n500 abortions were provided to young people in the state.20  \n64.  And  even  before  Tennesseeโs  abortion  ban  took  effect,  young  people  relied \ndisproportionately on organizations like SisterReach and MAC to secure resources needed to end \nan unwanted pregnancy. These included funding for the abortion itself, transportation to the \nabortion facility, and funding for childcare during the visit to the facility. These needs were \nespecially acute among young people belonging to communities of color, rural communities, and \nLGBTQ+ communities. \n65.  What is more, Tennessee required young people to secure the written consent of a \nparent or guardian to obtain an abortion. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 37-10-303(a). Most young people \ninvolved a parent in their decision of whether to continue a pregnancy.21 But some young people \ncould not secure that consent or had good reasons not to involve a parent or guardian in the \n \n19Poverty in the United States: Explore the Map, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS (Sep. 19, \n2022), https://www.americanprogress.org/data-view/poverty-data/poverty-data-map-tool/ (last \nvisited Jun 21, 2024).  \n20 Fiscal Note โ H.B. 1895 & S.B. 1971, Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee \n(Feb. 4, 2024), available at https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/113/Fiscal/HB1895.pdf. \n21 In a review of 1,500 minors seeking abortion care, 61% consulted at least one parent.

Among other challenges, these young people did not know whether or where their parents \nwere living, had parents who were incarcerated or battling substance abuse issues that prevented \nthem from adequately caring for their children, faced abusive or neglectful parents, lived in foster \ncare, or were in juvenile detention.22 These young people could, in theory, petition a court for \npermission  to  bypass  the  parental  consent  requirement.  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  ยง  37-10-303(b). \nDavidson County Juvenile Court Judge Sheila Calloway recalls deciding at least ten such petitions \na year until Tennesseeโs abortion ban took effect in 2022.23 Further, she recalls that young people \nwho sought a bypass were not always able to make the trip to her, potentially condemning them to \ncarry to term and become parents against their will.24 \n66.  In 2019, Tennessee enacted a criminal abortion ban whose enforcement would be \ntriggered by a U.S. Supreme Court judgment overturning Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Tenn. \nCode Ann. ยง 39-15-213. On June 24, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued such a judgment in \nDobbs v.

A study on judicial bypass seekers in Texas \nidentified common reasons why some minors choose not to disclose their abortion to their \nparents, included fear of being ostracized or โkicked outโ of the family home, substance abuse \nissues within the family, and fear of harming familial relationships.

Code Ann. ยง 38-15-213, subdiv. (c)(1)(A).

Yet, it has \neliminated the possibility of judicially bypassing the requirement.25 \n68.  An intended and horrifying consequence of Tennesseeโs criminal abortion ban is \nthat many Tennessee residents who do not want to remain pregnant, including young people, must \ntravel out of state for abortion care. Indeed, in the year after the ban took effect, the number of \nabortions provided in the state plummeted from about 1,200 each month to fewer than ten.26 This \nmeans that more than 14,000 Tennesseans, of whom almost 1,000 were young people, could no \n \n25 Paige Pfleger, Tennessee teens can no longer seek judicial bypass for abortions, NPR (Sept. 9, \n2022, 4:53 PM), https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1122123601/tennessee-teens-can-no-longer-\nseek-judicial-bypass-for-abortions#:~:text=Hourly%20News-\n,Tennessee%20teens%20can%20no%20longer%20seek%20judicial%20bypass%20for%20aborti\nons,about%20what%20options%20are%20left. \n26 Society of Family Planning, #WeCount Report, Society of Family Planning (Oct. 24, 2023), at \n11, https://societyfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WeCountReport_10.16.23.pdf. \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 25 of 40    PageID 25\nlonger  obtain  abortion  care  from  in-state  providers.27  Only  two  other  states  in  the  nation \nexperienced a greater drop in abortion care following the Dobbs decision.28 \n69.  Having to travel out of state for an abortion is generally more complicated, more \nexpensive, more time-consuming, and more distressing than obtaining an abortion in oneโs home \nstate. \n70.  As discussed below, Plaintiffs are intimately aware of the burdens that out-of-state \ntravel imposes on Tennesseans, and especially young people, because they work tirelessly to \nanticipate, identify, and alleviate those burdens. \n71.  Tennessee minors need to know where they can obtain care given their unique \ncircumstances, including their gestational age, health profile, and the funds they can cobble \ntogether for the cost of the care. \n72.  They need to know the most efficient way to get to their abortion appointment since \nmany lack a driverโs license and common carriers bar them from purchasing tickets on their own.29  \n \n27 Katherine Kortsmit, PhD et. al., MMWR Surveillance Summaries, Vol. 72, No. 9,  CENT.

Relatedly, young people in Tennessee, most of whom lack a meaningful income, \nneed transportation to their abortion appointments or funding covering transportation.  \n74.  The need to leave the state for an abortion also makes it more likely that young \npeople  in  Tennessee  will  need  lodging  or  funding  covering  lodging  to  legally  end  their \npregnancies. As with common carriers, Airbnb and many hotels will not sell accommodations to \na young person without an adultโs involvement.30  \n75.  And the longer someone seeking an abortion is away from home, the more meals \nthey will need away from homeโfor which young people in particular lack fundsโand the longer \nthey will need childcare. About one in ten of the young people that MAC serves need childcare. \nMore often, young people are caretakers for younger people in their family, such as siblings. \n76.  Just as before Tennesseeโs abortion ban took effect, these needs are especially acute \namong young people belonging to communities of color, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ \ncommunities. \n77.  MAC estimates that young people in Tennessee seeking an abortion out of state \nspend an average of five days with the organization developing a detailed plan for the journey and \nneed an average of $400 to execute that plan.

The fact that young people tend to learn they are pregnant at later \ngestational ages than adults only exacerbates these delays.  \n78.  Importantly, the need to flee Tennessee for legal abortion care makes many young \npeople feel like criminals. This is particularly true for young people who belong to populations \nthat are over-criminalized, including communities of color and poor communities. Likewise, \nhaving to leave the state adds untold stress and anxiety to the experience of obtaining an abortion \nas the young person contends with the prospect of having to carry their pregnancy to term and \nparent a child against their will.  \n79.  Thus, young people in Tennessee rely heavily on Plaintiffs and other helpers to \nobtain legal abortion care.  \nIII.  Plaintiffs Support Young People in Tennessee Seeking Legal Abortion Care in \nSolidarity with Young People and in Defiance of Efforts to Isolate and Degrade \nThem. \n80.  Plaintiffs are organizations with long histories of serving as helpers and trusted \nadults for young people who become pregnant.  \n81.  โHelpersโ are the people who assist others in realizing their rights.  \n82.  When helpers extend a hand, they do more than provide aid, however; they send a \nmessage. To those who are persecuted, they send a message of respect and solidarity: that the \npersecuted personโs humanity is bound up in that of the helpersโ, that their dignity is connected, \nthat their rights are one and the same, and that the helper is working toward achieving collective \nliberation. \n83.  To the persecutors, helpers send a message of protest and defiance: that the \npersecutorsโ attempts to isolate, stigmatize, and degrade others will not stand.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 28 of 40    PageID 28\n84.  This is true whether the aid furthers a politically popular viewpoint or a minority \none.  \n85.  It is especially true when the state disagrees with the message, values, or goals of \nthe aid provided. \n86.  Trusted adults are those in a community with whom young people can be and feel \nsafe. They are people young people can turn to in times of concern, hardship, or crisis. \n87.  Plaintiffs associate with pregnant young people in Tennessee as a show of respect \nand solidarity, communicating the messages that neither pregnancy nor their status as minors strips \nthem of their inherent dignity as decision-makers and that the young people are not alone. Plaintiffs \nexpress the message that there is, indeed, someone willing to truly listen to them as they consider \nwhether to continue their pregnancy and help them realize this momentous decision. \n88.  Plaintiffs also associate with pregnant young people in Tennessee as a show of \nprotest  and  defiance,  communicating  the  messages  that  continued  pregnancy,  childbirth, \nparenthood, or adoption must be as freely chosen as the pregnant personโs circumstances allow. \nPlaintiffs express the message that choosing not to continue a pregnancy is a valid, deeply personal \nchoice that should remain out of politiciansโ hands.  \n89.  Plaintiffs work, not only with pregnant young people in Tennessee, but also with \nother helpers to disseminate these messages, including reproductive justice organizations, abortion \nfunds, practical support organizations, clinicians, and donors.  \n90.  Plaintiff SisterReach, for example, provides two key services to young people in \nTennessee  seeking  legal  abortion  care  to  stand  in  solidarity  with  them,  communicate  the \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 29 of 40    PageID 29\nimportance of not imposing oneโs moral code on others, and resist politiciansโ efforts to do exactly \nthat to the detriment of the health and wellness of the communities SisterReach serves.31  \n91.  SisterReach sometimes provides these services at the request of a clergy member \ncalling on behalf of a young person in their congregation. At other times, it does so at the request \nof a young personโs parent.  \n92.  But SisterReach never requires that callers disclose their age, and thus does not \nrequire a young person to involve a parent or guardian in their decision to seek a legal abortion. \n93.  First, SisterReach provides accurate and complete information about a young \npersonโs lawful options for ending their pregnancy, which almost always involves abortion care in \nother states. SisterReach also refers young people to abortion providers based on their location and \ngestational age.  \n94.  Second, SisterReach provides funding to defray the cost of young peopleโs legal \nabortions. A young person is then free to use the funding they would have used to cover their \nabortion to pay for transportation, lodging, food, and childcare.  \n95.  By paying for young peopleโs legal abortion care regardless of the level of parental \ninvolvement, SisterReach honors their capacity to make decisions about the meaning of life and \nwhether to bring life into this world. It reaches a hand out to young people and lets them know \nthey are not alone and that they deserve to live in abundance.  \n96.  Plaintiff Midwest Access Coalition provides three key services to pregnant young \npeople in Tennessee, both to express respect for and solidarity with them, and to communicate \nprotest and defiance of attempts to brand abortion patients as shameful.  \n \n31 SisterReach also provides resources to Tennesseans, including young people, who continue \ntheir pregnancies, such as diapers, food, clothing, and toiletries. \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 30 of 40    PageID 30\n97.  MAC sometimes provides these services in close consultation with the young \npersonโs parent or primary caretaker, who sometimes accompanies the young person to their \nabortion appointment.  \n98.  But MAC does not ask callers their age, and thus does not require young people to \ninvolve a parent or guardian in their decision to seek a legal abortion.  \n99.  First, MAC gives young people in Tennessee accurate and complete information \nabout their lawful options for resolving their pregnancy, such as legal abortion care in other states. \nMAC also refers young people to clinicians, including abortion providers, consistent with young \npeopleโs considered decisions. In providing these services, MAC shows that young people deserve \nto make informed choices about their bodies and lives, and to have those choices honored. \n100.  Second, MAC helps pregnant young people in Tennessee navigate the logistics of \ntraveling to an out-of-state abortion provider by helping them develop a detailed plan. In some \ncases, an adult accompanying the young person has seldom left the state. Thus, these plans cover \neverything from how to maneuver air travel to places where the young person and her companion \ncan find nutritious, affordable food once they arrive at their destination. MAC also talks young \npeople in Tennessee through challenges as they arise during the trip. In working closely with young \npeople in this way, MAC communicates that, as human beings, they are entitled not simply to \nchoose whether to remain pregnant, give birth, or parent a child, but also to have a comfortable \nand private abortion experience if they choose to reject or delay those things.  \n101.  Third, MAC funds the travel, lodging, meals, and childcare that young people in \nTennessee need to obtain legal abortions out of state. This includes booking and/or paying for: \ngasoline, flights, commuter trains, ride shares, hotels, and babysitters. Occasionally, MAC also \nphysically transports young people from Tennessee to out-of-state abortion appointments. \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 31 of 40    PageID 31\n102.  While MAC does not pay for the abortion themselves, it does connect young people \nin Tennessee with sources of funding for abortion care, and often secures the funds on behalf of \nthe young people from multiple sources. \n103.  By providing practical support to pregnant young people who reside in Tennessee, \nMAC stands with them, affirms they are capable decision-makers, and expresses resistance to \npoliticiansโ attempts to impose pregnancy, childbirth, or parenthood on them.  \nIV.  SB 1971 Makes it a Crime to Support Young People in Tennessee Seeking Legal \nAbortion Care. \n \n104.  On May 28, 2024, Governor Bill Lee signed SB 1971 into law.  \n105.  SB 1971 creates the criminal offense of โabortion trafficking of a minor.โ S.B. \n1971(1)(a) (Tn. 2023). \n106.  The statute provides that โabortion traffickingโ occurs when any adult โrecruits, \nharbors, or transports a pregnant unemancipated minor within [Tennessee]โ without the written, \nnotarized consent of the minorโs parent or guardian for the purpose of: \n๏ท  โConcealing an act that would constitute a criminal abortion under ยง 39-15-213 from the \nparents or guardian of the pregnant unemancipated minorโ; \n๏ท  โProcuring an act that would constitute a criminal abortion under ยง 39-15-213 for the \npregnant unemancipated minor, regardless of where the abortion is to be procuredโ; or \n๏ท   โObtaining an abortion-inducing drug for the pregnant unemancipated minor for the \npurpose of an act that would constitute a criminal abortion under ยง 39-15-213, regardless \nof where the abortion-inducing drug is obtained.โ \nId. ยง 1(a).  \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 32 of 40    PageID 32\n107.  SB 1971 fails to define its key terms or phrases, including โrecruitingโ โharboringโ \nโtransporting,โ โconcealing,โ or โwithin Tennessee.โ \n108.  The legislative process leading up to the passage of SB 1971 demonstrates that \nlawmakers passed  the  statute  knowing  that  it  offered  little  guidance  as  to  what  conduct  it \ncriminalizes.  \n109.  When fellow legislators raised concerns during committee hearings and floor \ndiscussions about the then-billโs ambiguity, including the meaning of โrecruit,โ โharbor,โ or \nโtransport,โ bill sponsors Senator Paul Rose and Representative Jason Zachary demurred that the \ncourts would have to decide the issue.32 At other times, the sponsors admitted that โโto recruitโ \ncould include just about anything,โ and Representative Zachary characterized โhelp[ing] any \nyoung person travel out of state if they need[] an abortionโ as โrecruitment.โ33  \n110.  As Senator Jeff Yarbo summarized, SB 1971 โuses language that we donโt know \nwhat it means. We do not know what we are outlawing here . . . We are just creating a mess. And \nwe are creating a mess around conversations and interstate travel.โ34 \n \n32 See Senate Session, 61st Legislative Day (April 10, 2024, 10:03 AM)  \nhttps://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/videowrapper/default.aspx?CommID=601000; Video: House \nPopulation Health Subcommittee Hearing,(February 13, 2024, 2:05 PM)   \nhttps://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/videowrapper/default.aspx?CommID=801000; House Health \nCommittee Hearing, (February 21, 2024 11:09 AM)  \nhttps://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/videowrapper/default.aspx?CommID=801000. Rep. Zachary \nalso deferred some questions regarding statutory definitions to a legislative attorney, who \nsimilarly stated that the court would have to resolve questions about the billโs reach.  \n33 Id. at 0:13:17 (statement by Rep. Jason Zachary); Id. at 0:13:58 (statement by Rep. Jason \nZachary). \n34 See Senate Session,61st Legislative Day (April 10, 2024, 2:30 PM)  \nhttps://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/videowrapper/default.aspx?CommID=601000. \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 33 of 40    PageID 33\n111.  Notably, it is not clear that an abortion needs to occur for a helper to violate SB \n1971โthe statutory language may be construed to criminalize acting with the intent to help \nsomeone obtain an abortion. \n112.  SB 1971 โdoes not apply to the provision of a medical diagnosis or consultation \nregarding pregnancy careโ so long as the diagnosis or consultation excludes โperforming or \nattempting to perform an abortion . . . or arranging for travel . . . to procure an abortion or abortion-\ninducing drug.โ 35 Id. ยง 1(f). \n113.  SB 1971 makes โabortion traffickingโ a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by \nimprisonment for eleven months and twenty-nine days. Id. ยง 1(b).   \n114.  SB 1971 also authorizes a young personโs parent or legal guardian to bring a \nwrongful death suit against anyone who violates the statute. S.B. 1971(e) (Tn. 2023). In this case, \nthe plaintiff may recover economic damages, noneconomic damages, punitive damages, and \nattorney fees and costs. Id. ยง 1(e). The statute does not require a defendant to be criminally charged \nfor a civil suit to be brought against them. Id. \n115.  Without this Courtโs intervention, SB 1971 will take effect on July 1, 2024. \nV.  SB 1971 Would Severely Harm Plaintiffs and Young People in Tennessee \nSeeking Legal Abortion Care. \n \n116.  If SB 1971 takes effect, it will confuse some young people in Tennessee into \nthinking that it is illegal for them to obtain an abortion in another state even if the abortion is legal \n \n35 There is also an exemption for โcommon carrier[s] transporting passengers in the course and \nscope of their businessโ and โambulance driver[s] or operator[s] and any corresponding \nemergency medical services personnel . . . acting within the course and scope of their duties.โ \nS.B. 1971(c), Gen. Assemb., Sec. Reg. Sess. (Tn. 2023). \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 34 of 40    PageID 34\nthere. Consequently, SB 1971 will chill some young people in Tennessee from ever contacting \nPlaintiffs or other helpers for information, referrals, logistical, financial, or practical support.  \n117.  Further, SB 1971 does not allow Plaintiffs or other helpers to determine which of \ntheir services to young people in Tennessee who lack written, notarized parental consent constitute \ncriminal โrecruiting,โ โharboring,โ โtransporting,โ or โconcealing.โ  \n118.  Consider the following scenario. A young person in Tennessee expresses that she \ndoes not want to be pregnant, in part because her mother would throw her out of their home if she \nlearned of the pregnancy. A SisterReach employee provides the young person with comprehensive \ninformation  about  an  abortion provider  in  a  state  where  there  are  no parental  involvement \nrequirements. Does this constitute โrecruitingโ under SB 1971? \n119.   Similarly, does it constitute โharboringโ under SB 1971 for a young personโs aunt \nto allow her niece to spend a night in her Nashville home before the nieceโs flight to Washington, \nD.C., where the young person intends to obtain an abortion without her parents knowing? \n120.  And is a MAC employee โtransportingโ a young person under SB 1971 when they \ndisburse funds for an Uber to drive the young person from Tennessee to another state without \nknowing whether the young personโs parent consents to that service? \n121.  Lastly, does the โconcealingโ that SB 1971 criminalizes include a MAC employee \ndisbursing funds to a Tennessee hotel so that a young person can recuperate after obtaining an \nabortion in another state without disclosing the procedure to her family? \n122.  As these scenarios illustrate, the law is hopelessly vague. Consequently, it will have \na significant chilling effect on helpers who face criminal liability. Plaintiffs plan to cease providing \nservices to young people in Tennessee so long as SB 1971 can be enforced against them, especially \nin light of its criminal penalties. S.B. 1971(c) (Tn. 2023).  \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 35 of 40    PageID 35\n123.  SB 1971 would also, therefore, force Plaintiffs and other helpers to turn away any \nyoung person in Tennessee who cannot involve a parent in their abortion decision or has good \nreasons not to. These reasons include not knowing whether or where the young personโs parents \nare living; having parents who are incarcerated or battling substance abuse issues that prevent them \nfrom adequately caring for their children; having abusive36 or neglectful parents, including parents \nwho would throw the young person out for becoming pregnant; living in foster care;37 or living in \njuvenile detention.  \n124.  SB 1971 would also force Plaintiffs and other helpers to turn away young people \nin Tennessee whose parents have consented to their seeking a legal abortion in another state, but \nwho cannot secure written, notarized parental consent for all the support they need to obtain that \nabortion. Some parents lack state-issued identification, cannot visit a notary on short notice, or \nlack the technology needed to use a virtual notary.38  \n125.  In these ways, SB 1971 chills  \n126.  By depriving young people in Tennessee of helpersโ emotional support, SB 1971 \nwould exacerbate the fear and anxiety that they suffer trying to end a pregnancy in another state. \n \n36 The legislatureโs indifference towards young people living with abuse or incest is evident from \nits rejection of a proposed amendment that would have exempted young people from SB 1971 \nwhose pregnancy was caused by rape or incest by a parent. Am. 9 to H.B. 1895, Gen. Asemb., \nSec. Reg. Sess. (tn. 2023). \n37 For every 1,000 children under the age of eighteen in Tennessee, six live in foster care. Center \nfor American Progress, Poverty in the United States: Explore the Map (last visited March 6, 2024), \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/data-view/poverty-data/poverty-data-map-tool/.   \n38 Efforts to comply with the written notarization requirement may substantially delay a young \npersonโs abortion care, and not only require them to live with an unwanted pregnancy for longer, \nbut also increase the costs and health risks of the abortion.  \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 36 of 40    PageID 36\nIsolating young people in Tennessee in this way would also exacerbate the sensation of feeling \nlike a criminal for traveling out of state for legal healthcare.  \n127.  Moreover, without the guidance of Plaintiffs and other helpers, some young people \nin Tennessee may spend an inordinate amount of time identifying where they can get a legal \nabortion and securing an abortion appointment. This would push their abortions to even later \ngestational ages than usual, and not only require them to live with an unwanted pregnancy for \nlonger, but also increase the costs and health risks of the abortion.  \n128.  Even if they are able to cover the costs of obtaining an abortion out of state, they  \nmay have to divert funds from necessities such as food.  \n129.  Further, the logistical, financial and practical barriers to obtaining a legal abortion \nout of state may be insurmountable for some young people in Tennessee in the wake of the gap \nleft by Plaintiffs and other helpers. This is particularly true for young people who lack the support \nand guidance of a parent or trusted adult. A young person in foster care, for example, typically has \nno recourse other than a helper for securing the money needed for an abortion procedure. It is also \nparticularly true for young people who belong to communities of color, rural communities, and \nLGBTQ+ communities.  \n130.  In these ways, SB 1971 would compel some young people in Tennessee to carry a \npregnancy to term. Carrying a pregnancy to term against oneโs will can be traumatic even without \nserious complications during the pregnancy, labor, delivery, or postpartum period, especially as a \nyoung person. And it can require a young person to make agonizing decisions about whether or \nhow to parent a child in challenging circumstances.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp   Document 1   Filed 06/27/24   Page 37 of 40    PageID 37\n131.  SB 1971 would also compel some young people in Tennessee to try to end their \npregnancies themselves, which carries legal risks, particularly for young people belonging to \ncommunities of color.39  \n132.  By forcing Plaintiffs to turn away young people in Tennessee for lack of written, \nnotarized parental consent, SB 1971 would both stifle and subvert the messages they express \nthrough their services. That is, rather than express respect for and solidarity with young people or \ncommunicate protest and defiance of political schemes to deprive young people of legal abortion \naccess, SB 1971 would require them to reject and distance themselves from some young people, \nand to twist their operations to comply with legislation that would prevent some young people \nfrom obtaining legal abortions. \n \n    CLAIMS  \n \nCOUNT 1 \nVagueness  \n133.

SB 1971 is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment because it: a) fails to provide fair notice of the conduct it prohibits, and b) \nis so standardless that it authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the \nstatute.  \nCOUNT 2 \nFree Expression \n135.

Lipman \nJONATHAN SKRMETTI, et al.,    )  Magistrate Judge Tu M. Pham \n            ) \nDefendants.        ) \n \n \nRESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR SCHEDULING CONFERENCE \n \n \n  Defendants respectfully submit that a Rule 16 scheduling conference and the initiation of \ndiscovery would be premature at this juncture.  Plaintiffsโ motion [ECF 42] should thus be denied. \n  Courts have discretion to delay setting a preliminary scheduling conference where there is \nโgood causeโ for doing so.  See W.D. Tenn. L.R. 16(b)(4) (requirement that the court set a scheduling \nconference within certain time after service or appearance of a defendant does not apply where the \nโJudge finds good cause for delayโ); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(2) (deadline for issuing scheduling \norder inapplicable where the โjudge finds good cause for delayโ).  Indeed, a district court has the \npower โto control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for \nitself, for counsel, and for litigants.โ  Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936). \n  Good cause clearly supports this Courtโs delaying the preliminary scheduling conference in \nthis case until after it adjudicates Defendantsโ pending motion to dismiss.  Defendants have asserted \nthat this Court lacks jurisdiction due to Plaintiffsโ lack of standing and Defendantsโ own sovereign \nimmunity.  See MTD Mem., ECF 35 at PageID# 891-95; MTD Reply, ECF 40 at 995-98.  The Court \nis well within its discretion to postpone discovery until after it has addressed those threshold issues of \njusticiability.  See, e.g., Sault St. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians v. State of Mich., 5 F.3d 147, 149-50 (6th \n1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-02446-SHL-tmp     Document 43     Filed 03/17/25     Page 2 of 3      PageID\n1088\nCir. 1993) (sovereign immunity is โimmunity from suit itself, not just liabilityโ).  Defendants also have \nsought dismissal based on the complaintโs failure to state a plausible claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  MTD Mem., ECF 35 at 895-906; MTD Reply, ECF 40 at 998-1004.  When a โcomplaint is \ndeficientโ for any reason, the plaintiff โis not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.โ Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 686 (2009).  Requiring the parties to proceed with discovery before these threshold \njurisdictional and pleading-sufficiency issues have been decided would be unfairly prejudicial to \nDefendantsโall of whom are public servants. \nEven if the Court ultimately finds that any of Plaintiffsโ claims should be allowed to proceed, \nan early ruling on the merits of a case can โstreamline litigationโ by crystalizing the issues and \nโdispense with needless โฆ factfinding.โ Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 319 (1989).  It would thus \nserve judicial economyโand the interests of all partiesโto postpone the preliminary scheduling \nconference and the initiation of discovery until the Court has resolved the pending motion to dismiss. \nFor all the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request that Plaintiffsโ motion for a \nscheduling conference be denied as premature. \n Respectfully submitted, \n \nJONATHAN SKRMETTI \nAttorney General and Reporter \n \n/s/ Steven J.
