    "summary": "<p>This is a case challenging an Arizona statute (A.R.S. &sect; 15-120.02) that excludes transgender girls from participating in school-based sports teams that align with their gender identity. On April 17, 2023, the plaintiffs &mdash; school-aged transgender teens who were denied participation on several girls' school sports teams due to their assigned sex at birth &mdash; filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona against the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Arizona Interscholastic Association, a school district, and a private school. The plaintiffs filed suit under multiple statutes &mdash; including 42 USC &sect; 1983 (based on alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause), Title IX, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act &nbsp;&mdash; claiming that the ban discriminated on the basis of transgender status, had no viable justification, and caused harm to transgender students by excluding them from social participation. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees. District Court Judge Jennifer Zipps was assigned to the case. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The challenged statute prohibited schools from allowing transgender girls to play on girls&rsquo; teams in interscholastic competitions. In addition, the provision created a private cause of action for any student to sue a school or athletic program that breaches the law if the student believed they suffered a direct or indirect harm as a result. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the provision discriminated against the plaintiffs based on transgender status, which is a sex-based trait. They argued that because the statute does not have an &ldquo;exceedingly persuasive justification,&rdquo; a heightened scrutiny for classifications based on sex, it amounts to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the prohibition violated Title IX by discriminating against transgender individuals. They also argued that the denial of meaningful access to sports programs ran afoul the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because it constituted discrimination based on a disability (gender dysphoria). The plaintiffs alleged further that the exclusion caused them to experience stigma, denied them various benefits of participating in school sports, and &ldquo;directly contribute[d] to negative physical and emotional health consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day they filed the lawsuit, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Members of the Arizona legislature subsequently moved to intervene in the case as defendants. On June 12, 2023, the court allowed them to intervene only to make arguments against the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. 2023 WL 3956618.</p>\r\n<p>On July 20, 2023, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court found that excluding plaintiffs from school sports causes very serious injury, and emphasized that transgender girls who have not undergone male puberty do not have an athletic advantage over other girls. According to the court, the challenged statute was facially discriminatory against transgender students, and the defendants failed to demonstrate that the provision was substantially related to legitimate goals of ensuring equal opportunities for girls to play sports and to ensure safety. The court characterized the defendant's justification that the provision was necessary to protect girls&rsquo; sports as &ldquo;based on overbroad generalizations and stereotypes that erroneously equate transgender statute with athletic ability.&rdquo; Thus, the court found that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on their equal protection and Title IX claims. 683 F.Supp.3d 950. The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals a day later. The district court subsequently denied the defendants' motion for a stay of the injunction pending appeal. 2023 WL 5017231.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on December 11, the court dismissed the Title IX and Rehabilitation Act claims against one of the defendants (the private school), holding that those statutes did not apply to it. 2023 WL 11892137.</p>\r\n<p>On June 21, 2024, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, holding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged claims because those statutes prohibit discrimination based on gender dysphoria. 2024 WL 3091984.</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's grant of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit found that the district court did not err by concluding that the Plaintiffs would likely prevail on their Equal Protection claim. The Ninth Circuit held that the Arizona ban discriminates against transgender individuals on its face and that the defendants were unlikely to be able to adequately tie this to the important governmental objectives of preserving fair competition and equal opportunity for female student-athletes. The Ninth Circuit did not address the Title IX claims. 115 F.4th 1083</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2024, the defendants asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. As of April 4, 2025, the petition to the Court is still pending (docket 24-449).</p>",

(Doc. 98.) Plaintiffs filed an opposition and the \n18  Proposed Intervenors filed a reply. (Docs. 130, 138.) For the following reasons, the Court \n19  will deny the Motion to Intervene. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  In 2022, the Arizona Legislature and then-Governor Doug Ducey enacted A.R.S. § \n22  15-120.02 (the Statute), which provides that interscholastic or intramural “[a]thletic teams \n23  or sports designated for ‘females’, ‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the \n24  male sex.” The Statute went into effect in on September 23, 2022.  \n25  Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Megan Roe are two transgender girls who attend Arizona \n26  schools and intend to try out for and participate on girls’ sports teams in the current \n27  academic year. Plaintiffs allege that the Statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \n28  Fourteenth Amendment, Title IX, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 2 of 12\n \n \n \n1  the Rehabilitation Act. (Doc. 1.) In their April 2023 Complaint, Plaintiffs named five \n2  defendants: (1) Thomas C. Horne, in his official capacity as State Superintendent of Public \n3  Instruction; (2) Laura Toenjes, in her official capacity as Superintendent of the Kyrene \n4  School District; (3) the Kyrene School District; (4) The Gregory School, an independent \n5  school organized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit; and (5) the Arizona Interscholastic Association \n6  (AIA).1 (Id.) With their Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n7  on their Title IX and Equal Protection claims, seeking to enjoin Defendants from enforcing \n8  the Statute against them so that they may have “an equal opportunity to try out for and \n9  participate on the girls’ volleyball, soccer, basketball, and cross-country teams” during the \n10  school year while this case proceeds. (Doc. 3 at 5.) \n11  Before any defendant made an appearance, Senator Warren Peterson, President of \n12  the Arizona State Senate, and Representative Ben Toma, Speaker of the Arizona House of \n13  Representatives (the Legislators), filed a Motion to Intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the \n14  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Doc. 19.) Though the Court denied the Motion to the \n15  extent that Legislators sought to intervene  as of  right, the  Court granted permissive \n16  intervention on a limited basis to allow Legislators to present argument and evidence in \n17  opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 79.) Later, the Court \n18  amended its decision and allowed the Legislators to participate as a party to the litigation. \n19  (Docs. 111 & 142.) \n20  On June 30, 2023, while Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction was pending \n21  before the Court, Anna Van Hoek, Lisa Fink, Amber Zenczak, and Arizona Women of \n22  Action filed the pending Motion to Intervene in the action. (Doc. 98.)  \n23  On July 10, 2023, the parties to the litigation presented arguments before the Court \n24  in a hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 115.) The Court \n25  subsequently granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 127.)  \n26  The Motion to Intervene was fully briefed as of August 4, 2023. (Doc. 138.) \n27 \n \n1 Laura Toenjes and the Kyrene School District filed a Stipulation in lieu of Answer, \n28 \ninforming the Court that they “will not be an active participant in this case, including  \nfiling any response to Motions currently pending before the Court.” (Doc. 59 at 2.) \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 3 of 12\n \n \n \n1  DISCUSSION \nI.  Intervention as of Right \n2 \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit a party to intervene as of right under \n3 \nRule 24(a) and to intervene permissively under Rule 24(b). Cooper v. Newsom, 13 F.4th \n4 \n857, 864 (9th Cir. 2021). A party seeking intervention of right under Rule 24(a) must \n5 \nsatisfy a four-part test: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the applicant must have a \n6 \n“significantly protectable interest” relating to the property or transaction that is the subject \n7 \nof the action; (3) the applicant must be situated such that disposition of the action may \n8 \nimpair or impede the party’s ability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant’s interest \n9 \nmust not be adequately represented by existing parties. Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d \n10 \n1078, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003). An applicant seeking intervention bears the burden of proving \n11 \nthese requirements are met. Citizens for Balanced Use v. Mont. Wilderness Ass’n, 647 F.3d \n12 \n893, 897 (9th Cir. 2011). Failure to satisfy any one of the requirements is fatal to the \n13 \napplication. Perry v. Prop. 8 Official Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2009).  \n14 \nProposed Intervenors argue that they are entitled to intervene as of right in this \n15 \naction because their Motion was filed at an early stage in the litigation, their interest in \n16 \nensuring the equity of athletic opportunity through sex segregation would be impaired if \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ relief was granted, and the named Defendants will not adequately represent their \n18 \ninterests. (Doc. 98 at 9-16.) Plaintiffs argue that intervention as of right is not appropriate \n19 \nbecause the Proposed Intervenors’ interest is not related to the Plaintiffs’ claim and because \n20 \nthe Legislators and Defendant Horne are vigorously defending the challenged Statute on \n21 \nbehalf of the State. (Doc. 130 at 4-8.)  \n22 \nBecause  Proposed  Intervenors  have  not  proved  that  the  requirements  for \n23 \nintervention are met, the Court will deny the application to intervene as of right. The \n24 \nProposed Intervenors have not satisfied the four-part test required to intervene as a matter \n25 \nof right because: (1) their interest in ensuring the equality of athletic opportunity through \n26 \nsex segregation is not related to Plaintiffs’ as-applied challenge; (2) granting Plaintiffs’ \n27 \nrequested  relief  would  not  practically  impair  Proposed  Intervenors’  interest;  and  (3) \n28 \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 4 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Defendant Horne and the Legislators who crafted the bill have expressed their commitment \n2  to vigorously defend the Statute. \n3 \nA. Timeliness of Motion  \n4 \n“Courts weigh three factors in determining whether a motion to intervene is timely: \n5 \n‘(1) the stage of the proceeding at which an applicant seeks to intervene; (2) the prejudice \n6 \nto other parties; and (3) the reason for and length of delay.’” United States v. Alisal Water \n7 \nCorp., 370  F.3d 915, 921 (9th Cir. 2004)  (citation omitted). “The  ‘crucial date’ for \n8 \ndetermining timeliness is when the proposed intervenor ‘should have been aware that their \n9 \ninterests would not be adequately protected by the existing parties.’” Smith v. Los Angeles \n10 \nUnified Sch. Dist., 830 F.3d 843, 854 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Smith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d \n11 \n1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999)). “When considering prejudice to other parties, the Ninth Circuit \n12 \nhas held that the only ‘prejudice’ that is relevant . . . is that which flows from a prospective \n13 \nintervenor’s failure to intervene after he knew, or reasonably should have known, that his \n14 \ninterests were not being adequately represented.” Kalbers v. United States Dep’t of Just., \n15 \n22 F.4th 816, 825 (9th Cir. 2021). \n16 \nAs to the timing of the motion to intervene, Proposed Intervenors cite Ninth Circuit \n17 \ncase law that concluded “an intervention motion was timely when it was filed ‘less than \n18 \nthree months after the complaint was filed and less than two weeks after the [defendant] \n19 \nfiled its answer to the complaint.’” (Doc. 98 at 9-10); Citizens for Balanced Use v. Montana \n20 \nWilderness Ass’n, 647 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d \n21 \n949, 954 (9th Cir. 2006)). Proposed Intervenors argue that their motion to intervene meets \n22 \nthe Ninth Circuit’s “timeliness standard” because it was filed “less than eleven weeks after \n23 \nthe complaint was filed … about six weeks after Defendant Superintendent Horne filed his \n24 \nanswer to the complaint ….” (Doc. 98 at 10.) However, the “timeliness standard” that \n25 \nProposed Intervenors extrapolate from Ninth Circuit case law is relative and, as Plaintiffs \n26 \ncorrectly point out, this particular case progressed significantly within the first three \n27 \nmonths. Specifically, all parties appeared, the Legislators were granted limited permissive \n28 \nintervention,  and  the  parties  addressed  and  briefed  substantive  issues  with  regard  to \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 5 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. (Doc. 79, 80.) The quick progression of this \n2  case is relevant.  \n3  The Proposed Intervenors would or should have known whether their interests \n4  would be adequately protected by existing defendants. By their own account, prior to \n5  passage of the Statute, Proposed Intervenors spent substantial time and energy garnering \n6  support for the Statute, including giving a speech to the Arizona Senate committee, seeking \n7  witnesses to support the bill, and lobbying legislators. (Doc. 98 at 7-8). In light of their \n8  advocacy efforts, it is likely that Proposed Intervenors would have remained abreast of \n9  challenges to the Statute, particularly those made soon after the Statute’s implementation. \n10  Presumably, Proposed Intervenors would have determined whether their interests were \n11  adequately represented well before the three-month mark.   \n12  Despite Proposed Intervenors’ delay in filing their motion, the Court finds that no \n13  substantial  prejudice  to  the  other  parties  would  result  from  Proposed  Intervenors’ \n14  involvement at this point in the litigation. Though Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary \n15  injunction was granted, the merits of the case have yet to be briefed or argued. Additionally, \n16  Proposed Intervenors have stated that, if their motion is granted, they will collaborate with \n17  Defendants and take steps to avoid duplicative filings. (Doc. 138 at 10.) As such, the Court \n18  finds that the timeliness factor weighs slightly in favor of Plaintiffs, but is not dispositive.  \n19 \nB. Significantly Protectable Interest  \n20 \nPlaintiffs assert that because Jane Doe and Megan Roe bring an as-applied challenge \n21 \nto the Statute, Proposed Intervenors’ daughters will not suffer any “direct, non-contingent, \n22 \nand substantial” harm if the Court grants Plaintiffs’ requested relief. (Doc. 138 at 4.) The \n23 \nCourt agrees and finds that Proposed Intervenors have failed to establish that they would \n24 \nbe concretely affected if Plaintiffs are allowed to play on the girls’ sports teams at their \n25 \nschool.  \n26 \nRule 24(a)(2) requires that the asserted interest be “protectable under some law” and \n27 \nthat there exist “a relationship between the legally protected interest and the claims at \n28 \nissue.” Wilderness Soc'y v. U.S. Forest Serv., 630 F.3d 1173, 1179 (9th Cir. 2011). “If these \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 6 of 12\n \n \n \n1  two core elements are not satisfied, a putative intervenor lacks any ‘interest’ under Rule \n2  24(a)(2).” California Dep't of Toxic Substances Control v. Jim Dobbas, Inc., 54 F.4th 1078, \n3  1088 (9th Cir. 2022). “[A]n undifferentiated, generalized interest in the outcome of an \n4  ongoing action is too porous a foundation on which to premise intervention as of right.” S. \n5  California Edison Co. v. Lynch, 307 F.3d 794, 803 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Public Serv. \n6  Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197, 205 (1st Cir. 1998)).  \n7  Proposed Intervenors assert that, under Title IX, their interest in ensuring equality \n8  of athletic opportunity through sex segregation is a protectable interest. (Doc. 98 at 12.) \n9  Relying on California ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S., 450 F.3d 436 (9th Cir. 2006), they argue that \n10  their  protectable  interest  relates  to  Plaintiffs’  claims  because,  as  the  “intended \n11  beneficiaries” of the Statute (biological girls), their interest would be harmed if they were \n12  required to play with or against biological males in scholastic athletic competition. (Doc. \n13  138 at 2.)  \n14  In California ex rel. Lockyer, health care providers moved to intervene in an action \n15  brought  by  the  state  of  California  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  a  federal \n16  appropriations rider enacted to protect the health care providers’ interests. 450 F.3d at 439. \n17  In holding that the health care workers had the right to intervene, the Ninth Circuit \n18  explained, “if the Amendment is declared unconstitutional … [health care providers] will \n19  be more likely to be forced to choose between adhering to their beliefs and losing their \n20  professional  licenses.  Such  an  interest  is  sufficiently  ‘direct,  non-contingent,  [and] \n21  substantial.’” Id. at 441.  \n22  Unlike Lockyer, which dealt with a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a state \n23  statute,  here  Plaintiffs  bring  an  as-applied  challenge  to  the  Statute.  When  the \n24  constitutionality of a statute on its face is at issue, it necessarily follows that the intended \n25  beneficiaries of the statute would have a protectable interest in the outcome. Because this \n26  case involves an as-applied challenge, the outcome of the litigation will solely impact \n27  whether Jane Doe and Megan Roe can play school sports on girls’ teams. (See Doc. 1.) \n28  Significantly, if Plaintiffs prevail, Proposed Intervenors’ daughters will not be affected. \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 7 of 12\n \n \n \n1  None of the Proposed Intervenors’ daughters will play on the same team as or compete \n2  against Jane Doe or Megan Roe. And the “possibility” that Mrs. Zenczak’s daughters will \n3  transfer to a school in the Kyrene district and compete with or against Plaintiffs is too \n4  attenuated to demonstrate an interest that is sufficiently “direct, non-contingent, [and] \n5  substantial.” (Doc. 98-4 ¶ 3); see Lockyer, 450 F.3d at 451. \n6  As the parents of girls who compete in school sports, and supporters of the Statute, \n7  Proposed Intervenors have only demonstrated a generalized interest in the outcome of the \n8  ongoing action. Ensuring equality of athletic opportunity is a universal interest held by all \n9  parents with children participating in school sports. This interest alone does not warrant \n10  intervention as a right in a lawsuit. As such, the Court finds that the Proposed Intervenors’ \n11  asserted interest does not relate to the Plaintiffs’ claims.   \n12 \nC. Practical Impairment of Interest \n13 \nProposed Intervenors state that if the Court grants Plaintiffs’ requested relief, Ms. \n14 \nVan Hoek’s daughter may be forced to play against Jane Doe because she participates on \n15 \nAIA sports teams. (Doc. 98 at 12.) Additionally, Mrs. Zenczak’s daughters may transfer to \n16 \na Kyrene school in which case they may compete with or against Jane Doe. (Id.) Further, \n17 \nProposed Intervenors claim that the decision on appeal will establish precedent in this case. \n18 \n(Id.)  The  Court  concludes  that  Proposed  Intervenors’  interest  will  not  be  practically \n19 \nimpaired if Plaintiffs are granted relief in this action because the alleged harms are too \n20 \nremote and because the decision of a district court does not have binding precedential \n21 \nimpact.  \n22 \nA party has a sufficient interest for intervention purposes if it will “suffer a practical \n23 \nimpairment of its interests as a result of the pending litigation.” Lockyer, 450 F.3d at 441. \n24 \nThe Ninth Circuit has said that although “a stare decisis effect is an important consideration \n25 \nin  determining  the  extent  to  which  an  applicant’s  interest  may  be  impaired,”  the \n26 \nprecedential impact of a decision must be “clear.” United States v. State of Oregon, 839 \n27 \nF.2d 635, 638 (9th Cir. 1988); Green v. United States, 996 F.2d 973, 977 (9th Cir. 1993). \n28 \nIn the immediate case, it is unlikely that granting Plaintiffs’ requested relief would \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 8 of 12\n \n \n \n1  impair Proposed Intervenors’ interests. As noted above, Proposed Intervenors do not allege \n2  that their daughters attend the same school as Plaintiffs or compete against Plaintiffs’ \n3  schools. Van Hoek’s younger daughter attends a high school that is part of the AIA, but \n4  she plays softball and thus will not compete against either Jane Doe or Megan Roe, who \n5  do not. (Doc. 98-2 ¶ 3). And the “possibility” that Mrs. Zenczak’s daughters will transfer \n6  to a Kyrene school and compete with or against Plaintiffs is too attenuated to constitute an \n7  impediment to Proposed Intervenors’ interests. (Doc. 98 at 12.) Moreover, while the Court \n8  recognizes that stare decisis is an important consideration, Proposed Intervenors fail to \n9  establish a clear precedential impact. “A decision of a federal district court judge is not \n10  binding precedent in either a different judicial district, the same judicial district, or even \n11  upon the same judge in a different case.” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 709 n.7 (2011). \n12  Although there remains the possibility that the Ninth Circuit will eventually review this \n13  Court’s decision (as is the case with any litigation in this circuit), this is too speculative to \n14  support  Proposed  Intervenors’  claim  that  their  interest  would  be  impaired  without \n15  intervention. This is particularly true where the challenge is an as-applied challenge. Thus, \n16  Proposed Intervenors have not established that their practical interest would be impaired if \n17  the Court granted Plaintiffs’ requested relief.  \n18 \nD. Adequate Representation \n19 \nSince Proposed Intervenors filed their motion to intervene, the Court has permitted \n20 \nthe Legislators to intervene as a permanent party to the litigation. The Legislators, in \n21 \naddition to Defendant Horne, will adequately represent the interests of the Proposed \n22 \nIntervenors because these parties share the same “ultimate goal” in the litigation. In fact, \n23 \nDefendant Horne and the Legislators have vowed to vigorously defend the constitutionality \n24 \nof the Statute on behalf of their constituents.  \n25 \nIn  assessing  the  adequacy  of  representation,  the  Ninth  Circuit  considers  three \n26 \nfactors: “(1) whether the interest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly make \n27 \nall of a proposed intervenor’s arguments; (2) whether the present party is capable and \n28 \nwilling to make such arguments; and (3) whether a proposed intervenor would offer any \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 9 of 12\n \n \n \n1  necessary elements to the proceeding that other parties would neglect.” Arakaki, 324 F.3d \n2  at 1086. The “most important factor” in assessing the adequacy of representation is “how \n3  the interest compares with the interests of existing parties.” Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086. If \n4  an applicant for intervention and an existing party share the same ultimate objective, a \n5  presumption of adequacy of representation arises. League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. \n6  Wilson, 131 F.3d 1297, 1305 (9th Cir. 1997). “There is also an assumption of adequacy \n7  when the government is acting on behalf of a constituency that it represents ….” Citizens \n8  for Balanced Use, 647 F.3d at 898. To rebut the presumption, an applicant must make a \n9  “compelling showing” of inadequacy of representation. Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086.  \n10  Proposed Intervenors do not dispute that they share the same ultimate objective as \n11  Defendants Horne and the Legislators—defending the constitutionality of the Statute being \n12  challenged  by  Plaintiffs.  Thus,  Proposed  Intervenors  must  rebut  the  presumption  of \n13  adequacy with a compelling showing. For this purpose, Proposed Intervenors advance three \n14  arguments: (1) Defendants will not make the same arguments as Proposed Intervenors \n15  because Defendants represent a broader constituency; (2) Defendant Horne is not capable \n16  of making such arguments due to financial constraints; and (3) Defendant Horne will not \n17  adequately represent the perspective of biological girls. (Doc. 98 at 14-16; Doc. 138 at 4-\n18  6.) \n19  First, there is no basis to find that the Legislators and Defendant Horne will not \n20  make the same arguments proposed by the Proposed Intervenors as this case proceeds. \n21  Though Proposed Intervenors contend that the Legislators represent a “much broader \n22  constituency” which will “factor into how they respond to this action,” the Court finds no \n23  reason to believe that the Legislators would forgo any argument that Proposed Intervenors \n24  would  make.  (Doc.  138  at  5.)  Indeed,  as  evidenced  by  the  briefing  submitted  by \n25  Defendants, as well as the motion to dismiss submitted by Proposed Intervenors, Proposed \n26  Intervenors fail to articulate any argument that Defendant Horne or the State Legislators \n27  have  not  already  made.  Accordingly,  Proposed  Intervenors’  involvement  would  be \n28  unnecessary and redundant.  \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 10 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Additionally, the Legislators considered the Proposed Intervenors’ views when they \n2  crafted the Statute at issue. Proposed Intervenors individually, and AWOA as a whole, \n3  have been active in their support for the Save Women’s Sports Act. Ms. Zenczak “gave a \n4  speech to an Arizona Senate committee in favor of the Act,” and Ms. Fink has “[sought] \n5  witnesses to testify in support of the bill … and also email[ed] and call[ed] legislators in \n6  support of the bill.” (Doc. 98 at 7). The Legislators have expressed their commitment to \n7  vigorously defend the Statute stating “[they] have a crucial interest in … defending the \n8  constitutionality of state statutes” on behalf of their constituents. (Doc. 19 at 11.) Proposed \n9  Intervenors do not demonstrate that their interest differs from the Legislators or that the \n10  Legislators will fail to defend the bill with equal zealousness. \n11  Second, Proposed Intervenors argue that Defendant Horne is not capable of making \n12  the parent representatives arguments because he lacks the financial resources to do so. \n13  (Doc. 98 at 15.) Plaintiffs assert that this argument has already been disposed of by this \n14  Court—and the Court agrees. A.R.S. § 41-192(E) provides that, in the event that the \n15  attorney general is disqualified, “the state agency is authorized to make expenditures and \n16  incur indebtedness to employ attorneys to provide the representation or services.” Indeed, \n17  Defendant Horne has retained counsel, filed several motions, answered the complaint, and \n18  confirmed his intention to vigorously defend this lawsuit in the press. Moreover, the \n19  Legislators have been permitted to intervene. Defendant Horne and the Legislators are \n20  capable of adequately representing the Proposed Intervenors’ interests, which align with \n21  those of Defendant Horne and the Legislators.  \n22  Finally, Proposed Intervenors argue that they would “bring to this case the vital \n23  perspective of biological females,” an element that Defendant Horne would neglect. (Doc. \n24  98 at 16.) The Court is unconvinced that Defendants would neglect the perspective of \n25  biological  females.  On  the  contrary,  this  perspective  has  already  been  addressed  in \n26  Defendants’ briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Specifically, the \n27  Legislators argued that “[h]aving separate sex specific teams furthers efforts to promote \n28  sex equality by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 11 of 12\n \n \n \n1  strength and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain \n2  recognition, accolades, college scholarships and the numerous other long-term benefits that \n3  flow from success in athletic endeavors.” (Doc. 82 at 12.) Simply because an individual \n4  with a particular perspective is not made party to the litigation does not mean that their \n5  interest  will  not  be  adequately  protected  by  existing  parties.  Here,  Defendants  have \n6  demonstrated that they will represent the perspective of biological girls in the litigation. As \n7  such, there is no reason to believe that Defendants would neglect elements that would \n8  otherwise be raised by Proposed Intervenors.  \n9  In sum, Proposed Intervenors have not made a compelling showing that their interest \n10  will  not  be  adequately  protected  by  Defendants.  Accordingly,  the  Court  will  deny \n11  intervention as of right under rule 24(a).  \n12 \nII.  Permissive Intervention \n13 \nUnlike  intervention  as  of  right,  permissive  intervention  under  Rule  24(b)  is \n14 \ndiscretionary.  A  district  court  may  permit  intervention  if  the  movant,  “on  a  timely \n15 \nmotion…has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law \n16 \nor fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). The court must consider whether the intervention will unduly \n17 \ndelay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights. Dep’t of Fair Employment \n18 \n& Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 741 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n19 \nIf  the  initial  conditions  are  met,  the  court  may  also  consider  “whether  the \n20 \nintervenors’ interests are adequately represented by other parties … and whether parties \n21 \nseeking intervention will significantly contribute to full development of the underlying \n22 \nfactual issues in the suit and to the just and equitable adjudication of the legal questions \n23 \npresented.” Callahan v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., 38 F.4th 813, 822 (9th Cir. 2022). \n24 \nProposed Intervenors have established that they have a claim or defense that shares \n25 \na common question of law or fact with the main action, and their permissive intervention \n26 \nat this stage in the case would not unduly delay or prejudice the original parties. However, \n27 \nsuch  intervention  is  unnecessary  because,  as  explained  in  Section  I,  the  Proposed \n28 \nIntervenors’ interests will be adequately represented by the Legislators and Defendant \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 160   Filed 10/23/23   Page 12 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Horne. Moreover, participation of Proposed Intervenors is not necessary to fully develop \n2  the underlying factual issues in the suit. On the contrary, permitting intervention by \n3  Proposed Intervenors would likely result in redundant and unnecessary efforts.  \n4  Accordingly, the Court will deny Proposed Intervenors application for permissive \n5  intervention under Rule 24(b).  \n6  CONCLUSION \n7  For the foregoing reasons, Proposed Intervenors Motion to Intervene (Doc. 98) is \n8  DENIED.  \n9    Dated this 20th day of October, 2023. \n10   \n \n11 \n \n12 \n \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 12 - ",

Intervenor-Defendants argue Plaintiffs fail to state ADA and Rehabilitation \n17  Act claims in Count III of their Complaint because: (1) gender dysphoria is excluded from \n18  ADA coverage under 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b); (2) Plaintiffs do not allege that their gender \n19  identity disorder results from a physical impairment; and (3) Plaintiffs do not allege that a \n20  major life activity has been substantially limited. (See id.)1 The Motion is fully briefed. \n21  (Doc. 146, 150, 157.) For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the Motion. (Doc. \n22  146.) The Court concludes that Plaintiffs plausibly state claims under the ADA and the \n23  Rehabilitation Act in their Complaint.  \n24 \n25 \n \n1 Intervenor-Defendants also argue for dismissal of Plaintiff’s Equal Protection Claim \n26 \n(Count I) and Title IX Claim (Count II) for the reasons set out in the opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. (Doc. 146 at 11.) As Intervenor-Defendants \n27 \nacknowledge,  the  Court  considered  and  rejected  those  arguments  in  resolving  the \npreliminary injunction motion. (Doc. 127.)  The Court, therefore, will not revisit the \n28 \narguments here.  \n \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 2 of 8\n \n \n \n1   \n2  BACKGROUND \n3  Plaintiffs filed this action for declaratory and injunction relief, asserting A.R.S. § \n4  15-120.02 violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause, Title IX, the Americans \n5  With Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA). (See Doc. \n6  1.) A.R.S. § 15-120.02 provides that interscholastic or intramural “[a]thletic teams or sports \n7  designated for ‘females’, ‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.” \n8  (Doc. 1 at 2.)  If enforced, A.R.S. § 15-120.02 would prohibit Plaintiffs, two transgender \n9  girls, from participating on girls’ sports teams.  \n10  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a claim for relief by asserting \n11 \n“failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “To \n12 \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted \n13 \nas true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n14 \n662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A \n15 \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court \n16 \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” \n17 \nId. In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must “accept factual allegations in the \n18 \ncomplaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \n19 \nparty.” Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008). \n20 \nDismissal can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient \n21 \nfacts alleged under a cognizable legal theory. Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d \n22 \n696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988) (internal citation omitted). \n23 \nDISCUSSION \n24 \nI.  Plaintiffs plausibly allege that A.R.S. § 15-120.02 violates their rights under the \n25 \nADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \n26 \nA.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act  \n27 \nThe ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \n28  such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 3 of 8\n \n \n \n1  programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \n2  entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act similarly provides:  “No \n3  otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \n4  disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \n5  to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 \n6  U.S.C. § 794(a). Generally, the same legal principles govern ADA and Rehabilitation Act \n7  claims. M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 733 (9th Cir. 2012). “Because the applicable \n8  provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are ‘co-extensive,’ [courts] discuss both \n9  claims together, focusing on the ADA.” Id. To establish a discrimination claim under either \n10  the ADA or the RA, Plaintiffs must establish that (1) they have a disability; (2) they were \nexcluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \n11 \nof a public entity; and (3) the exclusion, denial, or discrimination was by reason of their \n12 \ndisability. Where Do We Go Berkeley v. Cal. Dep't of Transp., 32 F.4th 852, 860 (9th Cir. \n13 \n2022) (quoting Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001)). \n14 \nB. Gender dysphoria is not excluded under the ADA. \n15 \nIntervenor-Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ gender dysphoria is not a “disability” \n16 \nunder the ADA because Section 12211(b) excludes from the definition of disability: \n17 \n“transvestism,  transsexualism,  pedophilia,  exhibitionism,  voyeurism,  gender  identity \n18 \ndisorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders.” 42 \n19 \nU.S.C.  §  12211(b).    Although  gender  dysphoria  is  not  listed  in  Section  12211(b), \n20 \nIntervenor-Defendants argue that Congress intended to include gender dysphoria in the list \n21 \nof  excluded  conditions.  (Doc.  146  at  3.)    The  Fourth  Circuit  addressed  these  same \n22 \narguments in Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 766 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. \n23 \nCt. 2414 (2023).  The Court agrees with that court’s analysis and concludes that gender \n24 \ndysphoria is not excluded from coverage by Section 12211(b). \n25 \n1.   Section 12211(b) does not explicitly exclude gender dysphoria.  \n26 \nThe text of Section 12211(b) does not mention “gender dysphoria.” See 42 U.S.C. \n27 \n§ 12211; see Williams, 45 F.4th at 766–67 (“Although the ADA specifically lists a number \n28 \nof  exclusions  from  the  definition  of  disability,  that  list  does  not  include  gender \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 4 of 8\n \n \n \n1  dysphoria.”).  Adding  “gender  dysphoria”  to  the  list  of  ADA  exclusions  would \n2  impermissibly rewrite what Congress has chosen not to rewrite. See U.S. v. Watkins, 278 \n3  F.3d 961, 965 (9th Cir. 2002) (it is a canon of statutory construction that words should not \n4  be added to or read into a statute.) \n5  Intervenor-Defendants argue that “gender dysphoria” is excludable as a “gender \n6  identity disorder not resulting from physical impairments.” (Doc. 146 at 2-5.) However, \n7  this Court finds support for the conclusion that “gender dysphoria” is distinct from the \n8  category of “gender identity disorders.”  \n9  The ADA does not define “gender identity disorders.” As such, the Court looks to \n10  the meaning of the ADA's “terms at the time of its enactment.” Bostock v. Clayton County, \n140 S. Ct. 1731, 1738 (2020). The contemporary medical definitions are contained in the \n11 \nAmerican Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n12 \n(“DSM”). When the ADA was enacted in 1990, the DSM-3 did not recognize gender \n13 \ndysphoria as a diagnosis. See Williams, 45 F.4th at 767. Rather, the DSM-3 recognized \n14 \n“gender identity disorders,” of which the essential feature is “an incongruence between \n15 \nassigned sex and gender identity.” Id. (citing Am. Psych. Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical \n16 \nManual 71 (3d ed., rev. 1987) (DSM-III-R)).  \n17 \nIn 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed “gender identity disorders” \n18 \nfrom the DSM-5 and added “gender dysphoria” as a diagnosis. Williams, 45 F.4th at 767; \n19 \nsee Am. Psych. Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 451 (5th ed., \n20 \n2013) (DSM-5). Intervenor-Defendants argue the term “gender dysphoria” replaced the \n21 \nterm “gender identity disorder”  and did not create a new diagnosis. (Doc. 157 at 2.) Though \n22 \nthe DSM-5’s replacement of “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria” reflected \n23 \na shift in medical understanding, the revision was not simply semantic. Indeed, as the \n24 \nFourth  Circuit  noted  in  Williams,  such  a  reading  ignores  the  substantive  differences \n25 \nbetween the two diagnoses. 45 F.4th at 767.  \n26 \nGender  identity  disorders  and  gender  dysphoria  are  characterized  by  different \n27 \nsymptoms. Gender dysphoria is distinct from a “gender identity disorder” because it goes \n28 \nbeyond  merely  identifying  with  a  different  gender;  the  essential  element  of  “gender \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 5 of 8\n \n \n \n1  dysphoria”  is  the  “clinically  significant  distress”  felt  by  those  who  experience  an \n2  incongruence between their assigned sex and their gender identity. DSM-5 at 451–53. The \n3  DSM-5 explains that the distress caused by gender dysphoria may result in intense anxiety, \n4  depression, suicidal ideation, and even suicide. DSM-5 at 454–55. Further, when left \n5  untreated,  gender  dysphoria  can  expose  transgender  individuals  to  a  serious  risk  of \n6  psychological and physical harm. See Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 771 (9th Cir. \n7  2019). Prior to the DSM-5, there was no diagnosis for these distress symptoms. See \n8  Williams, 45 F.4th at 767. Thus, while the DSM-3 “pathologized the very existence of \n9  transgender people,” the DSM-5 “focuses on the dysphoria as the clinical problem, not \n10  identity per se.” Id. at 768-69 (noting not all transgender individuals will experience \ndistress as a result of gender incongruence, but for some, the incongruence results in gender \n11 \ndysphoria); DSM-5 at 451. Notably, in 2009, Congress amended the ADA, instructing \n12 \ncourts that the definition of “disability” “shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of \n13 \nindividuals under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted by the [ADA's] terms.” \n14 \n42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A).  For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that gender \n15 \ndysphoria does not fall under the category of “gender identity disorders” as conceived at \n16 \nthe time of the ADA’s enactment.  \n17 \n3. Gender dysphoria does not belong in the category of “other sexual \n18 \nbehavioral disorders.” \n19 \n  Intervenor-defendants argue that Section 12211(b)’s exclusion of “other sexual \n20 \nbehavior  disorders”  shows  Congress’s  intent  to  prohibit  the  ADA’s  application  to \n21 \nconditions that are sufficiently similar to the more specific categories of conditions that \n22 \nprecede it. (Doc. 146 at 5.) Intervenor-Defendants assert that gender dysphoria is an \n23 \nexcluded condition under this catchall provision. (Id.) However, there is support for the \n24 \nconclusion  that  gender  dysphoria  is  not  sufficiently  similar  to  “transvestism, \n25 \ntranssexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, and voyeurism” to be included in the catchall \n26 \nprovision. See 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b).  \n27 \nThe phrase “other sexual behavioral disorders” serves as a qualifier that emphasizes \n28 \nthe behavioral component of the explicitly excluded “sexual disorders.” See § 12211 \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 6 of 8\n \n \n \n1  (b)(1); see also Kozak v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 2023 WL 4906148, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. \n2  Aug. 1, 2023) (“[A]t the end [of Section 12211] is a qualifier that applies to the entire \n3  series: ‘or other sexual behavior disorders,’” suggesting that “Section 12211 is a list of \n4  behavior  disorders,”  with  a  “behavioral  component.”).  The  essential  element  of \n5  “transvestism” is the urge to cross-dress, see DSM-III-R-at 288; the essential element of \n6  “transsexualism” is the urge to live as a member of the opposite sex (often accomplished \n7  through cross-dress or sex reassignment), see DSM-III-R at 74; see also Kozak, 2023 WL \n8  4906148, at *6 (“'Transsexualism,’ as understood in 1987 . . . involved a behavioral \n9  component.”); the essential element of “pedophilia” is the urge to engage in sexual activity \n10  with a prepubescent child, DSM-III-R at 284; the essential element of “exhibitionism” is \nthe urge to expose one's genitals to a stranger, DSM-III-R 282; and the essential element \n11 \nof “voyeurism” is the urge to observe people who are either naked, disrobing, or engaged \n12 \nin sexual activity, DSM-III-R 289. Gender dysphoria is not characterized as a behavioral \n13 \ndisorder. See DSM-5; Kozak, WL 4906148, at *7 (“Gender dysphoria . . . has no behavioral \n14 \ncomponent” and “cannot be understood as a falling within the broad category of ‘sexual \n15 \nbehavior disorders.’”). As explained above, the essential element of gender dysphoria is \n16 \nthe “clinical distress” resulting from an individual’s discordant gender identity. DSM-5 at \n17 \n451–53. Finally, as noted above, Congress instructed the courts to construe the definition \n18 \nof  “disability”  in  favor  of  broad  coverage  in  its  2009  amendment.  See  42  U.S.C. \n19 \n§ 12102(4)(A).  Thus, this Court finds that gender dysphoria is not included in the catchall \n20 \ncategory “other sexual behavioral disorders,” or excluded as a disability.  \n21 \nC. Plaintiffs properly allege they have a qualifying disability.   \n22 \nIntervenor-Defendants dispute Plaintiffs’ allegation that they have a qualifying \n23 \ndisability under the ADA and RA because they do not specify “which major life activity \n24 \nhas been impaired.” (Doc. 146 at 8-10.) Intervenor-Defendants assert that “playing sports” \n25 \nis not a substantial life activity. (Doc. 146 at 10.) \n26 \nA disability is “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \n27 \nmajor life activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102. Major life activities include, but are not limited \n28 \nto,  caring  for  oneself,  eating,  sleeping,  learning,  reading,  concentrating,  thinking, \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 7 of 8\n \n \n \n1  communicating,  and  working.  42  U.S.C.  §  12102  (2)(A).  The  applicable  regulations \n2  instruct: “[t]he term ‘substantially limits’ shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive \n3  coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. ‘Substantially limits’ \n4  is not meant to be a demanding standard.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (j)(1)(i).  \n5  Plaintiffs plausibly allege that they have a disability that substantially limits one or \n6  more major life activities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(A). Plaintiffs allege that they suffer from \n7  gender dysphoria. (See Doc. 1 at 12 (“Jane was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she \n8  was seven years old and has lived her life as a girl since she was five years old.”) and Doc. \n9  1 at 14 (“[Megan] was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 10 years old,” and \n10  “has been receiving puberty-blocking medication since she was 11 years old,” as part of \nher medically-prescribed treatment).) Gender dysphoria is a condition recognized by the \n11 \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, and is described in the DSM-5 as characterized by \n12 \n“clinically significant distress.” DSM-5 at 451. Symptoms of gender dysphoria include \n13 \nanxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide. (Doc. 1 at \n14 \n8); see DSM-5 at 451-59. These symptoms may substantially limit major life activities \n15 \nincluding, but not limited to, eating, sleeping, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, \n16 \ncommunicating, and working. (Doc. 150 at 12.) In fact, the DSM-5 states that the functional \n17 \nconsequences of gender dysphoria include “interfere[nce] with daily activities.”  DSM-5 \n18 \nat  454-454.  Because  Plaintiffs  suffer  from  gender  dysphoria,  and  gender  dysphoria \n19 \nmanifests  in  symptoms  that  interfere  with  daily  activities,  the  Court  concludes  that \n20 \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently allege that they have a qualifying disability under the ADA.   \n21 \nIntervenor-Defendants’  assertion  that  “playing  sports”  is  not  a  substantial  life \n22 \nactivity  confuses  the  analysis.  (Doc.  146  at  9.)  The  ADA  and  RA  do  not  prohibit \n23 \ndiscrimination in the provision of “major life activities.” Rather, the ADA and RA prohibit \n24 \ncovered entities from precluding qualified individuals with a disability from participating \n25 \nin a program, service, or activity, or otherwise discriminating against them because of their \n26 \ndisability.  See Furgess v. Pa. Dep't of  Corr., 933 F.3d 285, 288–89 (3d Cir. 2019) \n27 \n(emphasis added). The issue is not whether “playing sports” is a major life activity, but \n28 \nrather, whether “playing sports” is an activity from which Plaintiffs have been excluded \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 213   Filed 06/21/24   Page 8 of 8\n \n \n \n1  based on their disability. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that they \n2  suffer from gender dysphoria, and that gender dysphoria qualifies as a disability under the \n3  ADA and RA. Accordingly,  \n4  IT IS ORDERED Intervenor-Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 146) is denied.  \n5  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Intervenor-Defendants must file an Answer to the \n6  Complaint on or before July 15, 2024.   \n7    Dated this 21st day of June, 2024. \n8   \n9   \n \n10 \n \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 8 - ",

Horne, in his official capacity as \nState Superintendent of Public Instruction; \n15 Laura Toenjes, in her official capacity as \nSuperintendent of the Kyrene School District \n16 Kyrene School District; The Gregory School; \nand Arizona Interscholastic Association, Inc., \n17\nDefendants.\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 2 of 21\n1 INTRODUCTION \n2 1. Generations of children across America have enjoyed playing sports with \n3 their  friends  and  classmates.  They  have benefited  physically,  mentally, socially,  and \n4 developmentally from doing so. For many children, playing sports is an important part of \n5 their school experience. \n6 2. Plaintiffs want nothing more than an equal opportunity to enjoy that same \n7 experience: to try out for and participate on the girls’ volleyball, soccer, basketball, and \n8 cross-country  teams  at  their  schools.  Arizona  law,  however,  denies  Plaintiffs  that \n9 opportunity because Plaintiffs are transgender girls. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02 (the \n10 “Ban”). Plaintiffs bring this suit to challenge the application of the Ban to them because it \n11 violates the U.S. Constitution and federal law.    \n12 3. The  Ban’s  exclusion  of  Plaintiffs  from  participating  in  school  sports \n13 because they are transgender denies them equal treatment under the law, excludes them \n14 from a critical school activity, causes them to experience shame and stigma, denies them \n15 well-known physical and mental health benefits that arise from playing school sports, and \n16 directly contributes to negative physical and emotional health consequences. \n17 4. The  Ban,  as  applied  to  Plaintiffs,  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause \n18 because  it  impermissibly  discriminates  based  on  Plaintiffs’  transgender  status  and  on \n19 account of their sex because being transgender is a sex-based trait. Accordingly, Arizona \n20 may apply the Ban to Plaintiffs only if it has an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for \n21 doing so, U.S. v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), which here is absent. In fact, the \n22 Ban’s impermissible discrimination cannot survive any level of scrutiny.  \n23 2 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 3 of 21\n1 5. The  application  of  the  Ban  to  Plaintiffs  also  violates  Title  IX  of  the \n2\nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq. (“Title IX”), the Americans \n3 with Disabilities  Act,  42 U.S.C.  §  12101,  et seq.  (“ADA”), and  Section 504  of the \n4 Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Rehabilitation Act”). \n5 6. Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  enjoin  the  Ban’s \n6 enforcement as applied to them. Without the injunctive relief sought, Plaintiffs will suffer \n7 immediate irreparable injury.\n8 PARTIES \n9 I. Plaintiffs \n10 7. Plaintiff  Jane  Doe1  is  an  11-year-old  transgender  girl  who  resides  in \n11 Maricopa County, Arizona. She proceeds in this case by her next friends and parents \n12 Helen Doe and James Doe.  \n13 8. Plaintiff Megan Roe is a 15-year-old transgender girl who resides in Pima \n14 County, Arizona. She proceeds in this case by her next friends and parents Kate Roe and \n15 Robert Roe. \n16 II. Defendants \n17 9. Defendant  Thomas  C.  Horne  is  the  State  Superintendent  of  Public \n18 Instruction. Defendant Horne is the chief executive officer of the Arizona Department of \n19 Education.  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  §  15-231(B)(2).  He  is  charged  with  superintending  the \n20 schools of Arizona and executing all education laws. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-251. Upon \n21\n1   Plaintiffs are filing herewith a motion to proceed via pseudonym. \n22\n23 3 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 4 of 21\n1 information and belief, Defendant Horne is a grant recipient of federal funds because he \n2\nhas administrative control over the Arizona Department of Education. He is sued in his \n3 official capacity only. \n4 10. Defendant Laura Toenjes is the Superintendent of Kyrene School District. \n5 Defendant Toenjes executes her official duties in Maricopa County and is responsible for \n6 the administration and oversight of the Kyrene School District. She is sued in her official \n7 capacity only. \n8 11. Defendant Kyrene School District is a public school district serving parts of \n9 Maricopa County. Kyrene School District oversees the Kyrene Aprende Middle School.  \n10 Upon information and belief, it receives federal financial assistance.  \n11 12. Defendant The Gregory School is a private middle and high school located \n12 in Tucson. Upon information and belief, it receives federal financial assistance.   \n13 13. Defendant  Arizona  Interscholastic  Association,  Inc.  (“AIA”)  is  a \n14 membership organization of public and private high schools that regulates and oversees \n15 interscholastic athletic competition in the State of Arizona. The Kyrene School District \n16 and The Gregory School’s athletic teams participate in competitions regulated by the AIA \n17\nand comply  with the AIA’s guidelines and policies. The AIA is subject to Title IX \n18\nbecause it indirectly receives federal funding from its member schools. See 34 C.F.R. \n19\n§ 106.2(i). It is also a government actor subject to the Fourteenth Amendment. Clark v. \n20\nArizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir. 1982).  \n21\n22\n23 4 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 5 of 21\n1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2 14. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under \n3 color of state law of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n4 Constitution and under Title IX, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n5 15. This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \n6 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the controversy arises under the laws of \n7 the United States, including laws providing for the protection of civil rights, and because \n8 this suit seeks redress for the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured by \n9 the United States Constitution. \n10 16. Venue is proper in the District of Arizona under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and \n11 (2) because Defendants reside in the District and because a substantial part of the events \n12 or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the District. \n13 17. This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide \n14 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \n15 Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n16 18. This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  because  they  are \n17 domiciled in Arizona and because their denial of Plaintiffs’ rights under the United States \n18 Constitution and the laws of the United States occurred within Arizona. \n19 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n20 I. Arizona’s Ban \n21 19. Prior to the enactment of the Ban, transgender girls were permitted to play \n22 on girls’ sports teams. Each school or school district set its own rules governing the \n23 5 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 6 of 21\n1 participation  of  transgender  students  in  intramural  sports,  and  the  AIA  set  rules  for \n2\ntransgender students’ participation in interscholastic sports.   \n3 20. In October 2014, the AIA Executive Board approved for the first time a \n4 transgender student’s request to compete on a sports team consistent with that student’s \n5 gender identity.2 Subsequently, the AIA considered requests for transgender students to \n6 play on the teams consistent with their gender identity on a case-by-case basis.3\n7 21. By  December  2018,  the  AIA  in  conjunction  with  its  Sports  Medicine \n8 Advisory Committee formalized and revised its policy to permit transgender students to \n9 play on teams consistent with their gender identity so long as the student’s parent or \n10 guardian made the request to the school administrator or athletic director and explained \n11 when their child realized they were transgender.4\n12 22. This policy’s goal was to ensure that transgender students felt supported \n13 and did not need to provide intrusive medical documentation.5 At that time, the AIA had \n14\n2   Robert Obert, AIA Approves First Transgender Athlete to Play a Sport, AZ Central \n15\nSports (Oct. 22, 2014), https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/high-\nschool/2014/10/22/aia-approves-first-transgender-athlete-play-sport/17718485/.  \n16\n3   Erin Buzuvis, “As Who They Really Are”: Expanding Opportunities for Transgender \n17 Athletes to Participate in Youth and Scholastic Sports, 34 L. & Ineq. 341, 346–47 \n(2016). \n18\n4 Minutes: Executive Board Meeting, Arizona Interscholastic Association (Dec. 10, \n19 2018), https://aiaonline.org/files/16539/executive-board-meeting-minutes-december-\n10-2018.pdf; Arizona Interscholastic Association, AIA Policies and Procedures, Art. \n20 41 (2022-2023), https://aiaonline.org/files/16362/article-41-sports-medicine.pdf.  \n5 AIA alters language of transgender policy for Arizona student-athletes, ABC 15 \n21\n(Dec. 17, 2018), https://www.abc15.com/sports/aia-alters-language-of-transgender-\npolicy-for-arizona-student-athletes. \n22\n23 6 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 7 of 21\n1 received only two or three requests by transgender students to play on teams consistent \n2\nwith their gender identity and had approved all of them.   \n3 23. Arizona’s  schools  and  teams  were  thus  including  the  small  number  of \n4 transgender students who sought to be treated in accordance with their gender identity, \n5 and no problems or complaints regarding their participation in school sports arose.   \n6 24. Despite the AIA’s successful policies, the Arizona Legislature passed the \n7 Ban at issue in this case on March 24, 2022. \n8 25. The Ban requires each interscholastic or intramural athletic team or sport \n9 that is sponsored by a public school or a private school whose students or teams compete \n10 against a public school to be designated as a boys’, a girls’, or coed team based on the \n11 students’ “biological sex.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(A). The Ban prohibits athletic \n12 teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls to be open to members of the \n13 “male sex.” Id. § 15-120.02(B). \n14 26. The Ban does not define the terms “biological sex,” “male sex,” or “sex” \n15 generally.  The  Legislative  findings,  however,  suggest  “sex”  as  being  determined  at \n16 “[fertilization] and revealed at birth or, increasingly, in utero.” S.B. 1165, 55th Leg., 2d \n17\nReg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022), § 2. \n18\n27. The law also forbids an interscholastic association—such as the AIA—\n19\nfrom permitting transgender girls to play on girls’ teams in interscholastic competitions. \n20\nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(A), (D).\n21\n28. In addition to regulating schools and interscholastic associations directly, \n22\nthe law creates a private cause of action for any student to sue a school or athletic \n23 7 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 8 of 21\n1 association that permits transgender girls to play on girls’ teams if that student believes \n2\nthat they have “suffer[ed] any direct or indirect harm” from a violation of the law. Id. § \n3 15-120.02(E), (G).     \n4 II. Transgender People and Sports  \n5 29. “Gender identity” is the medical term for a person’s internal, innate, deeply \n6 held sense of their own gender. Everyone has a gender identity. There is a medical \n7 consensus that a person’s gender identity is not subject to voluntary change and has a \n8 significant biological foundation. \n9 30. From a medical perspective, a person’s sex encompasses several different \n10 biological  attributes,  including  sex  chromosomes,  certain  genes,  gonads,  the  body’s \n11 production of and response to sex hormones, internal and external genitalia, secondary \n12 sex characteristics, and gender identity. Those attributes are not always aligned in typical \n13 ways. \n14 31. When a child is born, a health care provider designates the child’s sex to be \n15 marked on the child’s birth certificate based on the child’s observable anatomy. In the \n16 vast  majority  of  cases,  that  initial  designation  turns  out  to  be  consistent  with  the \n17\nindividual’s gender identity. For a transgender person, however, that initial designation \n18\nturns out to be inaccurate because it does not reflect the person’s gender identity.  \n19\n32. Gender dysphoria, which results from physical impairments, is the distress \n20\ncaused by incongruence between a person’s gender identity and their designated sex at \n21\nbirth. If untreated, gender dysphoria may cause anxiety, depression, eating disorders, \n22\nsubstance abuse, self-harm, and suicide. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosable and treatable \n23 8 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 9 of 21\n1 condition recognized by the American Psychiatric Association6 and is articulated in the \n2 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (“DSM-V”).7\n3 33. Under the medical standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria \n4 in adolescents, the only safe and effective treatment for gender dysphoria is to permit \n5 transgender adolescents to live consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of their \n6 lives. In addition, when a child begins puberty, doctors may prescribe puberty blocking \n7 medication and, for older adolescents, hormone therapy. Forcing a transgender girl to be \n8 treated  as  male  contradicts  the  medical  standards  of  care  and  can  result  in  serious \n9 negative  health  consequences,  including,  for  example,  severe  anxiety,  depression, \n10 substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality. \n11 34. There is a scientific consensus that the biological driver of average group \n12 differences between girls and boys with respect to athletic performance is differences in \n13 their respective levels of testosterone, which begin to diverge significantly only after the \n14 onset of puberty. \n15 35. Transgender  girls  who  receive  puberty-blocking  medication  do  not  go \n16 through male puberty. As a result, they do not experience the physiological changes \n17\ncaused by the increased production of testosterone associated with male puberty. If those \n18\n19\n6 What is Gender Dysphoria?, American Psychiatric Association, \n20 https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-\ndysphoria (last visited Apr. 12, 2023).  \n21\n7   American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) (2022).  \n22\n23 9 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 10 of 21\n1 girls subsequently receive hormone therapy, their bodies develop the skeletal structure, \n2\nfat distribution, and muscle and breast development typical of other girls. \n3 36. Transgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication and those who \n4 receive hormone therapy typically have testosterone levels in the same range as other \n5 girls and significantly lower than boys who have begun pubertal development.  \n6 37. For  transgender  youth,  research  has  shown  that  being  accepted  and \n7 supported  as  who  they  are  is  enormously  beneficial  to  their  health  and  well-being. \n8 Conversely, being denied recognition and support can cause significant harm, exacerbate \n9 gender dysphoria, and expose them to the risk of discrimination and harassment.\n10 III. The Benefits of School Sports\n11 38. For children and young adults, school-sponsored sports offer benefits they \n12 will experience throughout life and often have a positive developmental impact that is \n13 second only to family support. For example, students who participate in high school \n14 sports are more likely to finish college and more likely to be actively engaged in planning \n15 for their future. Participation in sports has a documented positive effect on academic \n16 achievement, with student athletes generally experiencing better academic achievement \n17\nthan students who are not athletes.  \n18\n39. Sports  provide  an  opportunity  to  gain  confidence,  to  build  social \n19\nconnections, and to develop important social, emotional, and coping skills. Participation \n20\nin  sports  provides  students  the  opportunity  to  make  friends  and  become  part  of  a \n21\nsupportive community of teammates and peers. It also reduces the effects of factors, such \n22\nas  stressful life events, that lead to  an increased likelihood of experiencing anxiety, \n23 10 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 11 of 21\n1 depression, poor academic performance, dropping out of school, and engaging in risky \n2\nbehaviors. Learning how to manage stressful events at a young age provides benefits to \n3 student  athletes  throughout  their  lives,  even  after  the  competitions  have  ended.  In \n4 contrast, when young people are excluded from participating in youth sports, or do not \n5 feel accepted or respected, they do not have the opportunity to experience these benefits. \n6 In addition, when youth are excluded from an equal opportunity to participate because \n7 they are transgender, the negative impact on their emotional and social development is \n8 severe;  in  addition  to  losing  the  benefits  that  participation  in  sports  provides,  they \n9 internalize the shame and stigma of being officially excluded for a personal characteristic \n10 (being transgender) over which they have no control and that already subjects them to \n11 prejudice and social stigma.   \n12 40. Participation in sports also allows students to build teamwork and discipline \n13 skills. Students learn the importance of working as part of a group to achieve a common \n14 goal  and  the  necessity  of  each  individual  member’s  role  in  bringing  about  success. \n15 Students also experience the success and personal fulfillment achieved from discipline, \n16 hard work, and perseverance through countless hours of practice and competition. \n17\n41. Through sports, students develop social skills and emotional maturity that \n18\nallow them to create and sustain lifelong friendships. Sportspersons spend considerable \n19\ntime with their teammates, often experiencing high-pressure situations together that lead \n20\nto deeper and more meaningful social bonds and friendships. These sports experiences in \n21\nturn result in reduced anxiety and higher self-esteem. These benefits positively affect \n22\nstudents throughout their entire lives. \n23 11 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 12 of 21\n1 42. Coaches and other staff members provide students who participate in sports \n2\naccess to meaningful mentorship and guidance. This mentorship extends beyond school \n3 sports, guiding students through academics and life. \n4 43. Students who participate in sports also derive physical and mental health \n5 benefits. In general, students who play sports in school have fewer physical and mental \n6 health problems than those who do not. Students who participate in sports further learn \n7 how  to  regulate  their  emotions,  and  they  experience  significantly  lower  levels  of \n8 emotional problems and distress as a result. Participation in sports at a young age also \n9 encourages  continued  participation  as  an  adult,  in  turn  reducing  the  morbidity  and \n10 mortality of many diseases that arise later in life. \n11 IV. Plaintiffs’ Medical Treatment and Participation in Sports \n12 A. Jane Doe \n13 44. Plaintiff Jane Doe is an 11-year-old girl who attends a public elementary \n14 school in the Kyrene School District. She will attend Kyrene Aprende Middle School \n15 starting in July 2023. Jane is transgender. This will be the first school year the Ban will \n16 apply to Jane.  \n17 45. Jane was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was seven years old \n18 and has lived her life as a girl since she was five years old. She is accepted by her family, \n19 soccer teammates, classmates, coaches, and teachers.  \n20 46. As part of her medical treatment for gender dysphoria, Jane’s doctors are \n21 monitoring her for signs of the onset of puberty. Because she has not yet started puberty, \n22\n23 12 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 13 of 21\n1 Jane  has  not  experienced  any  of  the  physiological  changes,  including  muscle \n2\ndevelopment, that increased testosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy. \n3 47. Jane  has played soccer  on  girls’ club and recreational sports  teams for \n4 nearly five years. She enjoys playing soccer and making new friends through it. The \n5 friendships she has made through soccer are real and meaningful, and Jane has shared \n6 with her soccer teammates that she is a transgender girl. Jane’s teammates and coaches \n7 have been highly supportive of her identity. \n8 48. For Jane’s family, playing sports is also an important value. \n9 49. Jane intends to try out for the girls’ soccer team at Kyrene Aprende Middle \n10 School—which has separate teams for boys and girls—in the winter 2023-2024 athletic \n11 season.   \n12 50. Jane also intends to try out for the girls’ cross-country team in the summer \n13 2023 season, which starts in mid-July 2023, and the girls’ basketball team in the spring \n14 2024 season at Kyrene Aprende Middle School. Like soccer, basketball has separate \n15 teams for boys and girls. While cross-country practices co-educationally, boys and girls \n16 compete separately.   \n17\n51. Jane’s health and well-being depend on being able to follow her medically-\n18\nprescribed treatment, including living as a girl in all aspects of her life.  \n19\n52. Playing on boys’ teams or not being able to compete with other girls is not \n20\nan option for Jane. It would be painful and humiliating for Jane to be forced to play on \n21\nboys’ teams. It would also contradict her medical treatment for her gender dysphoria.  \n22\n23 13 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 14 of 21\n1 53. The Ban thus denies Jane the opportunity to participate in school sports at \n2\nall and the numerous social, educational, and physical and emotional health benefits that \n3 school sports provide.  \n4 54. But for the Ban, the Kyrene School District would permit Jane to play on \n5 girls’ sports teams. In fact, the  members of the Kyrene School District’s  Governing \n6 Board have denounced the Ban.8\n7 55. If the Ban is not enjoined as to Jane, it will cause Jane to suffer irreparable \n8 emotional, psychological, and developmental harm that will irreparably and negatively \n9 affect her educational and social experience.  \n10 B. Megan Roe \n11 56. Plaintiff  Megan  Roe  is  a  15-year-old  transgender  girl  who  attends  The \n12 Gregory School.  \n13 57. Megan has identified as a girl since she was very young. She was diagnosed \n14 with gender dysphoria when she was 10 years old.  \n15 58. Before  starting  at  The  Gregory  School,  Megan’s  parents  informed \n16 administrators and teachers at the school that Megan is a transgender girl.  \n17 59. As part of her medically-prescribed treatment for gender dysphoria, Megan \n18 has been receiving puberty-blocking medication since she was 11 years old, after clinical \n19 documentation of the initial signs of puberty. This medication has prevented her from \n20\n8   Paul Maryniak, Kyrene Board Rips Transgender, Other State Laws, Ahwatukee \nFoothills News (Sept. 21, 2022, last updated Oct. 25, 2022), \n21\nhttps://www.ahwatukee.com/news/article_50d6aaa4-3907-11ed-baa2-\n5b5183664658.html.  \n22\n23 14 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 15 of 21\n1 undergoing male puberty. Megan then started to receive hormone therapy when she was \n2\n12 years old. As a result, she has not experienced the physiological changes, including \n3 muscle development, that increased testosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy. \n4 Instead,  the  hormones  she  has  received  have  caused  her  to  develop  many  of  the \n5 physiological changes associated with puberty in females.  \n6 60. Megan’s  health  and  well-being  depend  on  being  able  to  follow  her \n7 medically-prescribed treatment, including living as a girl in all aspects of her life.  \n8 61. Megan started to play volleyball a couple of years ago and has found it fun \n9 and enjoyable. Before volleyball, Megan enjoyed other sports, including swimming and \n10 dance. Megan’s schoolfriends are on the girls’ volleyball team.  Megan’s teammates, \n11 coaches, and The Gregory School have been highly supportive of her transgender identity \n12 and would welcome her participation on the girls’ volleyball team. \n13 62. At The Gregory School, volleyball is one of the most important sports in \n14 the school’s social fabric. The matches are an important social occasion, which are well-\n15 attended by the school community. \n16 63. The  Gregory  School  has  separate  volleyball  teams  for  boys  and  girls. \n17\nMegan intends to try out for the girls’ volleyball team at The Gregory School this fall.   \n18\n64. The Gregory School participates in the AIA and complies with its rules so \n19 that students can play in interscholastic competitions.9 But for the Ban, The Gregory \n20\nSchool would permit Megan to play on the girls’ volleyball team.   \n21\n9 The Gregory School Athletics Program, The Gregory School, \n22 https://www.gregoryschool.org/athletics (last visited Apr. 13, 2023).  \n23 15 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 16 of 21\n1 65. Competing on a boys’ volleyball team is not an option for Megan. It would \n2\nbe painful and humiliating for Megan to be forced to be on a boys’ team and would also \n3 contradict her medical care.  \n4 66. The Ban thus denies Megan the opportunity to participate in school sports \n5 at all. She will be prohibited from participating in school sports and therefore will be \n6 denied the numerous social, educational, and physical and emotional health benefits that \n7 school sports provide. \n8 67. If  the  Ban  continues  to  apply  to  Megan,  she  will  suffer  irreparable \n9 emotional, psychological, and developmental harm that will irreparably and negatively \n10 affect her educational and social experience. \n11 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n12 COUNT I\nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n13 U.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n(Against Defendants Horne, Toenjes, Kyrene School District, and the Arizona \n14 Interscholastic Association) \n15 68. Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as though \n16 fully set forth herein.  \n17\n69. Plaintiffs bring this Count against Defendants Thomas C. Horne and Laura \n18\nToenjes in their official capacities, as well as against Defendants Kyrene School District \n19\nand the Arizona Interscholastic Association.   \n20\n70. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable \n21\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \n22\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \n23 16 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 17 of 21\n1 71. The Ban singles out and categorically bars Plaintiffs from competing on \n2\ngirls’  teams  because  they  are  transgender  girls.  In  so  doing,  the  Ban  impermissibly \n3 discriminates based on Plaintiffs’ transgender status and, because being transgender is a \n4 sex-based trait, it also discriminates against Plaintiffs based on sex.  \n5 72. Under the Equal Protection Clause, classifications based on sex are subject \n6 to heightened scrutiny and are therefore presumptively unconstitutional absent a showing \n7 by the government that the discrimination has an “exceedingly persuasive” rationale and \n8 is substantially related to an important state interest. \n9 73.  The Ban fails heightened scrutiny as to Plaintiffs because it is not \n10 substantially related to any important state interest. Plaintiffs, who identify and live as \n11 girls and who have not and will not undergo male puberty, are similarly situated to other \n12 girls with respect to their participation on girls’ sports teams at school. The Ban, \n13 therefore, undermines the health and well-being of Plaintiffs by denying their access to \n14 school sports without any exceedingly persuasive rationale to support it. The Ban cannot \n15 survive even rational basis review because it lacks any rational basis, rests on stereotypes \n16 and misconceptions, and undermines rather than advances any alleged purpose.  \n17\nCOUNT II\nViolation of Title IX \n18\n20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. \n(Against All Defendants) \n19\n74. Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as though \n20\nfully set forth herein.  \n21\n22\n23 17 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 18 of 21\n1 75. Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis \n2\nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n3 discrimination  under  any  education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  financial \n4 assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n5 76. Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.   \n6 77. Under  Title  IX,  discrimination  “on  the  basis  of  sex”  encompasses \n7 discrimination against individuals because they are transgender. See Doe v. Snyder, 28 \n8 F.4th  103,  114  (9th  Cir.  2022)  (holding  that  discrimination  against  transgender \n9 individuals violates Title IX).   \n10 78. Title IX forbids sex discrimination in athletic programs. The implementing \n11 regulations for Title IX permit sports teams to be separated by sex but do not mandate \n12 such separation.  \n13 79. Neither Title IX, its regulations, nor its guidance purport to define “sex” as \n14 something that is determined at fertilization and revealed at birth or in utero. \n15 80. By barring Plaintiffs from playing on girls’ sports teams because they are \n16 transgender, Defendants exclude them from, deny them the benefits of, and subject them \n17\nto discrimination in educational programs and activities “on the basis of sex,” in violation \n18\nof their rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et \n19\nseq. \n20\n21\n22\n23 18 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 19 of 21\n1 COUNT III\nDiscrimination On Basis of Disability \n2\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 \n3 (Against All Defendants)\n4 81. Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as though \n5 fully set forth herein.  \n6 82. The ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \n7 reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \n8 the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \n9 by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act extends \n10 that protection to “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 \n11 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n12 83. Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.   \n13 84. Plaintiffs  have  a disability within the  meaning and  scope  of  42  U.S.C. \n14 § 12102  based  on  their  gender  dysphoria,  which  results  from  physical  impairments. \n15 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 29 U.S.C. § 705(9). Defendants are therefore required to afford \n16 Plaintiffs the protections of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n17 85. By depriving Plaintiffs of the opportunity to try out for and compete on \n18 girls’  sports  teams,  denying  Plaintiffs  meaningful  access  to  sports  programs  and \n19 activities, and subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination, all because of Plaintiffs’ gender \n20 dysphoria, Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the \n21 Rehabilitation Act. Playing on boys’ sports teams is not an available option for Plaintiffs \n22\n23 19 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 20 of 21\n1 because it would exacerbate Plaintiffs’ disabilities, be detrimental to their health, and \n2\ncontradict their prescribed medical treatment. \n3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter orders and \n5 judgment: \n6 A. Declaring that the enforcement by Defendants of Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-\n7 120.02 violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \n8 Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., the \n9 Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and Section 504 of the \n10 Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq.\n11 B. Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining  enforcement  or  any  threat  of \n12 enforcement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02 by Defendants and their employees, agents, \n13 appointees, or successors as to Plaintiffs, and requiring Defendants and their employees, \n14 agents, appointees, or successors to permit Plaintiffs to try out for and play on the school \n15 sports’ teams consistent with their gender identity; \n16 C. Waiving the requirement for the posting of a bond as security for entry of \n17\npreliminary injunctive relief; \n18\nD. Awarding Plaintiffs their costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees \n19\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable laws; and \n20\nE. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n21\n22\n23 20 \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 1   Filed 04/17/23   Page 21 of 21\n1\n2 Respectfully submitted this 17th day of April, \n2023. \n3\n/s/ Colin M.

FOR ADMINISTRATIVE STAY \n   \n12  Thomas C Horne, et al., \n \n13  Defendants. \n \n14   \n15  Before the Court is Intervenor-Defendants’ Motion for Stay Pending Appeal and \n16  Request for Administrative Stay.  (Doc. 132.)  Intervenor-Defendants request that the Court \n17  stay  its  July  20,  2023  preliminary  injunction.  In  the  alternative,  they  request  an \n18  administrative stay of the injunction for seven days to allow time for the United States \n19  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to consider an emergency motion to stay and request \n20  for administrative stay.1  The preliminary injunction at hand enjoins Defendant Horne from \n21  enforcing A.R.S. § 15-120.02 (Save Women’s Sports Act) as to 11-year-old Jane Doe and \n22  15-year-old Megan Roe.  The injunction allows Plaintiffs to participate in girls’ sports at \n23  their schools when athletics begin in July 2023.  Neither school opposes the injunction.       \n24  “The bar for obtaining a stay of a preliminary injunction is higher than the Winter \n25  standard for obtaining injunctive relief.”  Index Newspapers LLC v. U.S. Marshals Serv., \n26  977 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir. 2020).  In deciding whether to grant a stay, “a court considers \n27 \n \n28  1 Intervenor-Defendants request a ruling on their Motion by Monday, July 31, 2023, \nto allow them time to seek prompt appellate relief, if necessary.

Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 \n5  (2009) (cleaned up).  “The first two factors are the most critical; the last two are reached \n6  only once an applicant satisfies the first two factors.”  Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, \n7  1007 (9th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up).  Applying the Nken factors here, the Court denies \n8  Intervenor-Defendants’ Motion for Stay. \n9  Failure to Demonstrate Strong Showing of Success on Merits \n10  Applicants for a stay pending appeal must make a strong showing that they are likely \n11  to succeed on the merits.  Al Otro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1010.  Under the Ninth Circuit’s sliding \n12  scale approach to preliminary injunctions, “the elements of the preliminary injunction test \n13  are balanced, so that a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of \n14  another.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  For \n15  example, where there is a weak irreparable harm showing, the applicant must make a strong \n16  showing of a likelihood of success on the merits.  Al Otro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1010.  This \n17  sliding scale approach also applies to stays pending appeal.  Id. at 1007.  It is insufficient \n18  that the chance of success is better than negligible; the applicant must demonstrate “more \n19  than a mere possibility of relief.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  Intervenor-Defendants fail to \n20  make the required showing. \n21  Intervenor-Defendants  argue they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  for  four \n22  reasons.  (Doc. 132 at 2.)  They argue that the Act is subject to rational basis review “[f]or \n23  the reasons stated” in their prior briefing.  Id. at 9.  But binding precedent holds that laws \n24  that  discriminate  against  transgender  persons  are  sex-based  classifications  subject  to \n25  heightened scrutiny.  See Karnoski v Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1201 (9th Cir. 2019) (“We \n26  conclude that the 2018 Policy on its face treats transgender persons differently than other \n27  persons, and consequently something more than rational basis but less than strict scrutiny \n28  applies.”).  Therefore, rational-basis review does not apply.   \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 136   Filed 07/31/23   Page 3 of 8\n \n \n \n1  Intervenor-Defendants assert that the Court’s finding that transgender females who \n2  do not undergo male puberty have no competitive advantage over female athletes is clearly \n3  erroneous because “all the competent evidence in the record suggests the opposite.”  (Doc. \n4  132 at 7.)  They also argue that “[t]he evidence of male competitive advantage pre-puberty \n5  is overwhelming and effectively uncontradicted.”  (Id.)  These arguments misstate the \n6  record and the evidence.  Experts cited by both parties agree that male physiological \n7  advantages  are  largely  the  result  of  circulating  testosterone  levels  in  men  post-\n8  puberty.  (Doc. 127 at ¶¶ 97, 100, 112-117.)  In addition, Plaintiffs’ expert provided \n9  persuasive evidence that any prepubertal differences between boys and girls in various \n10  athletic measurements are minimal or nonexistent.  (Id. at ¶¶ 109-110.)  Defendants’ data \n11  regarding differences in prepubescent girls’ and boys’ physical fitness performance was \n12  not credited because the data is observational, does not determine a cause for what is \n13  observed, and fails to account for other factors which could explain the data.  (Id. at ¶¶ 101, \n14  103-106, 109-110.) \n15  Intervenor-Defendants argue that the Court misapplied heightened scrutiny.  (Doc. \n16  132  at  3-7.)    To  withstand  heightened  scrutiny,  a  classification  by  sex  “must  serve \n17  important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of \n18  those objectives.”  (Doc. 127 at ¶ 145) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976)). \n19  According to Intervenor-Defendants, the Court required perfect tailoring of the Act to \n20  Plaintiffs rather than assessing the validity of the classification as a whole.  (Doc. 132 at 5-\n21  7.)  Intervenor-Defendants argue that the Court disregarded extensive evidence of the \n22  competitive advantages for the large majority of transgender–female athletes, i.e., those \n23  that transition after undergoing male puberty, simply because the individual Plaintiffs \n24  claim they did not, or will not, undergo male puberty.2  (Id. at 4.) \n25  This argument is unpersuasive.  First, it imagines facts that were not presented. \n26  Intervenor-Defendants did not introduce any evidence, let alone extensive evidence, that \n \n27 \n2 Although Intervenor-Defendants disparage  Plaintiffs’ “claims” that they have not, \n28  and  will  not,  undergo  male  puberty,  Plaintiffs  provide  evidentiary  support  for  their \nstatements.  See Doc. 127 at ¶¶ 24-27, 48-51. \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 136   Filed 07/31/23   Page 4 of 8\n \n \n \n1  the majority of transgender-female athletes have undergone male puberty.  The evidence \n2  at the hearing showed only that in the past ten to twelve years, the Arizona Interscholastic \n3  Association (AIA) fielded twelve requests and approved seven students to play on a team \n4  consistent with their gender identity.  (Doc. 127 at ¶ 66.)  No evidence was presented as to \n5  whether any of those seven students were transgender females, and no evidence was \n6  presented as to whether any of those seven students had undergone puberty.  This lack of \n7  evidence suggests that the Act’s categorical bar against transgender female athletes is \n8  unrelated to the purpose of the Act. \n9  In  addition,  Intervenor-Defendants’  argument disregards  much  of  the  Court’s \n10  heightened scrutiny analysis.  In applying heightened scrutiny, the Court examined the \n11  Act’s “actual purposes and carefully consider[ed] the resulting inequality.” SmithKline \n12  Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Lab'ys, 740 F.3d 471, 483 (9th Cir. 2014).  The Court found that \n13  Defendant Horne and Intervenors failed to produce “persuasive evidence at the preliminary \n14  injunction stage to show that the Act is substantially related to the legitimate goals of \n15  ensuring equal opportunity for girls to play sports and to prevent safety risks,” and cited \n16  the breadth of the Act and its effect on individuals other than Plaintiffs as support.  (Id. \n17  at ¶¶ 158-161.)  Intervenor-Defendants claim in their Motion for Stay that the State’s \n18  purpose is to regulate unfair advantages caused by transgender-female athletes who have \n19  undergone male puberty, but the Act broadly and categorically prohibits all transgender \n20  athletes, including prepubescent transgender athletes.  The Act bans all education levels of \n21  transgender athletes—from kindergarten through college—although there is no evidence \n22  of injuries or unfair competitive advantages occurring at the kindergarten level.  And \n23  despite the State’s claim that the Act is intended to protect girls, the Act only bans \n24  “biological boys” from girls’ teams, without prohibiting “biological girls” from playing on \n25  boys’ teams, including teams made up of boys who have undergone puberty.  (Doc. 127 at \n26  ¶¶ 157-160.)  Given the Act’s overbreadth, it cannot be said that the Court required a \n27  “perfect fit.”  Rather, the State failed to show “an exceedingly persuasive justification” for \n28  its discriminatory treatment, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996), or a \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 136   Filed 07/31/23   Page 5 of 8\n \n \n \n1  justification that is genuine and not reliant on overbroad generalizations, id. at 533. \n2  Finally,  Intervenor-Defendants  argue  that  the  Court’s  conclusion  that  the  Act \n3  violates Title IX is unlikely to be upheld on appeal because Title IX specifically authorizes \n4  separation of sports teams based on biological sex which Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 \n5  S. Ct. 1731 (2020), and Grabowski v. Arizona Board of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110 (9th Cir. \n6  2023), do not change.  (Doc. 132 at 10.)  Whether legislation that prohibits all transgender \n7  athletes from participating in competitive sports violates Title IX is currently subject to \n8  debate.  A mere “possibility of relief,” however, fails to demonstrate a strong showing of \n9  likely success on the merits, particularly in light of Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim. \n10    The Court concludes that Intervenor-Defendants fail to make a strong showing that \n11  they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  claim.  This  failure  is  particularly \n12  detrimental because, as discussed below, Intervenor-Defendants’ showing of irreparable \n13  harm is weak.  See Al Otro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1010 (where there is a weak irreparable harm \n14  showing, the applicant must make a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the \n15  merits).  Thus, the first Nken factor favors Plaintiffs. \n16  Intervenor-Defendants Will Not Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Stay \n17  An applicant for stay pending appeal must demonstrate that a stay is necessary to \n18  avoid likely irreparable injury to the applicant while an appeal is pending.  Al Otro Lado, \n19  952 F.3d at 1007.  Showing a possibility of irreparable injury is insufficient.  Id.  The \n20  applicant is required to show that irreparable harm is likely to occur before the appeal is \n21  decided.  Id.  The applicant's irreparable harm burden “is higher than it is on the likelihood \n22  of success prong, as [it] must show that an irreparable injury is the more probable or likely \n23  outcome.”  Id.  \n24  In its Order granting the preliminary injunction, the Court concluded, “There is no \n25  evidence that any Defendant will be harmed by allowing Plaintiffs to continuing playing \n26  with their peers as they have done until now.”  (Doc. 127 at ¶ 184.)  Intervenor-Defendants \n27  advance little argument as to their irreparable harm, citing only  “the sovereign interest of \n28  the State of Arizona in enforcing its valid statutes.”  (Doc. 132 at 14.).  Clearly, however, \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 136   Filed 07/31/23   Page 6 of 8\n \n \n \n1  there is no irreparable harm if the statute is not valid.  Intervenor-Defendants “cannot suffer \n2  harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  Rodriguez v. Robbins, \n3  715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013).  The second Nken factor favors Plaintiffs.   \n4  Substantial Injury to Other Parties  \n5  Because Intervenor-Defendants fail to establish the first two Nken factors, the Court \n6  need not address the last two factors.  See Al Otro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1007 (“The first two \n7  factors are the most critical; the last two are reached only once an applicant satisfies the \n8  first two factors.”) (cleaned up).  However, factors three and four also do not support \n9  Intervenor-Defendants’ request for stay. \n10  The third factor, “whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other \n11  parties interested in the proceeding,” weighs against granting a stay.  Plaintiffs will suffer \n12  injury in the absence of a stay.  Prior to the Act, there were no bars to Plaintiffs participating \n13  in girls’ sports at their schools.  If a stay is granted,  Plaintiffs will suffer severe and \n14  irreparable mental, physical, and emotional harm if the Act applies to them because they \n15  cannot play on boys’ sports teams; the Act will effectively exclude Plaintiffs from school \n16  sports and deprive them of the social, educational, physical, and emotional health benefits \n17  that both sides acknowledge come from school sports; and Plaintiffs will suffer the shame \n18  and humiliation of being unable to participate in a school activity simply because they are \n19  transgender—a personal characteristic over which they have no control.  (Doc. 127 at ¶¶ \n20  174-176.)   The  school  year  has  started,  and  Plaintiffs  want  to  participate  in  girls’ \n21  sports.  The issuance of a stay would deprive Plaintiffs the opportunity to participate in \n22  girls’ first quarter sports—which are currently in progress—including the first cross-\n23  country meet scheduled for August 14, 2023.  (Doc. 127 at ¶¶ 32, 35, 38, 41, 55, 57-60.)   \n24  Intervenor-Defendants argue that the preliminary injunction imposes irreparable \n25  harm on other interested parties.  (Doc. 132 at 12-14.)  They argue that, absent a stay, \n26  “biological girls” will be unfairly displaced from participation in girls’ sports by Plaintiffs, \n27  whose involvement will necessarily exclude “biological girls” who try out for the team, \n28  and that Plaintiffs’ involvement will reduce the other girls’ playing time and success.  (Id. \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 136   Filed 07/31/23   Page 7 of 8\n \n \n \n1  at 12-13.)  However, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs’ participation will cause such \n2  harms to other participants.  There is no evidence that the schools limit the number of girls \n3  who participate in any of the sports at issue and there is no evidence that either Plaintiff \n4  would present an advantage, let alone an unfair advantage, if allowed to participate.    \n5  Public Interest Lies in Plaintiffs’ Favor \n6  Intervenor-Defendants argue that the public interest favors a stay because the public \n7  has an interest in upholding the laws passed by their elected officials.  (Doc. 132 at \n8  15.)  However, as discussed above, a state cannot suffer harm from an injunction that \n9  merely ends a discriminatory practice.  Rodriguez, 715 F.3d at 1145.  Thus, it follows \n10  that, “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional \n11  rights.”  (Doc. 127 at ¶ 180) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n12  2012)).  The fourth Nken factor supports denial of the Motion for Stay.     \n13  Administrative Stay Would Disrupt Status Quo \n14  As an alternative to their request for a stay pending appeal, Intervenor-Defendants \n15  request a seven-day administrative stay to allow the Circuit Court of Appeals time to \n16  consider their emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction order.  (Doc. 132 at \n17  15.)   An  administrative  stay  “is  only  intended  to  preserve  the  status  quo  until  the \n18  substantive motion for a stay pending appeal can be considered on the merits.”  Doe #1 v. \n19  Trump, 944 F.3d 1222, 1223 (9th Cir. 2019).  The Nken factors do not support imposition \n20  of an administrative stay.  Moreover, prohibiting Plaintiffs from participating in girls’ \n21  athletics would disrupt the status quo.

A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish (1) that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. The third and fourth factors, harm to the \nopposing party and weighing the public interest, merge when the Government is the opposing party. With respect to \nthe fourth factor, it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights, because \nall citizens have a stake in upholding the Constitution. But a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never \nawarded as of right.\nCivil Procedure > Appeals > Standards of Review > Abuse of Discretion\nCivil Procedure > Remedies > Injunctions > Preliminary & Temporary Injunctions\nCivil Procedure > Appeals > Standards of Review > Clearly Erroneous Review\nHN2[ ]  Standards of Review, Abuse of Discretion\nThe federal appellate court reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. This \nreview is limited and deferential, and it does not extend to the underlying merits of the case. A district court \nnecessarily abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous \nfindings of fact. But as long as the district court got the law right, it will not be reversed simply because the federal \nappellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case. A district \ncourt's factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be \ndrawn from the facts in the record. Although the federal appellate court reviews legislative factfinding under a \ndeferential  standard,  the  court  retains  an  independent  constitutional  duty  to  review  factual  findings  where \nconstitutional rights are at stake. The court reviews a district court's finding of discriminatory purpose for clear error.\nCivil Procedure > Appeals > Record on Appeal\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 2 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1083; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **1\nHN3[ ]  Appeals, Record on Appeal\nThe federal appellate court's review of the district court's findings, pursuant to its action on a motion for preliminary \njudgment is restricted to the limited record available to the district court when it granted or denied the motion.\nConstitutional Law > Equal Protection > Gender & Sex\nConstitutional Law > Equal Protection > Judicial Review > Standards of Review\nHN4[ ]  Equal Protection, Gender & Sex\nHeightened scrutiny applies to laws that discriminate based on transgender status.

Determining whether an \ninvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and \ndirect evidence of intent as may be available. The important starting point for assessing discriminatory intent under \nArlington Heights is the impact of the official action whether it bears more heavily on one race than another. Other \nconsiderations relevant to the purpose inquiry include, among other things, the historical background of the \njurisdiction's decision; the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision; departures from the \nnormal procedural sequence; and the legislative or administrative history, especially any contemporary statements \nby members of the decision-making body. Although the federal appellate court starts with a presumption that a \nlegislature acted in good faith, a plaintiff needs to demonstrate only that discrimination against a protected class \nwas a substantial or motivating factor in enacting the challenged provision, not the sole or predominant factor.\nConstitutional Law > Equal Protection > National Origin & Race\nConstitutional Law > Equal Protection > Judicial Review > Standards of Review\nHN6[ ]  Equal Protection, National Origin & Race\nA  policy's  discriminatory  impact  may  support  a  finding  of  discriminatory  purpose.

It arises when the defendant enacts a law or policy that treats \nindividuals differently on the basis of seemingly neutral criteria that are so closely associated with the disfavored \ngroup that discrimination on the basis of such criteria is, constructively, facial discrimination against the disfavored \ngroup.

The goal of medical treatment for gender dysphoria is to alleviate a \ntransgender patient's distress by allowing them to live consistently with their gender identity. This treatment, \ncommonly referred to as \"transition,\" includes one or more of the following components: (i) social transition, \nincluding adopting a new name, pronouns, appearance, and clothing, and correcting identity documents; (ii) medical \ntransition, including puberty-delaying medication and hormone-replacement therapy; and (iii) for adults, surgeries to \nalter the appearance and functioning of primary and secondary sex characteristics.

In 2022, Arizona enacted the Save Women's Sports Act, which prohibits \"students of the male \nsex,\" including transgender women and girls, from participating in women's and girls' sports. The complaint alleges \nthat the Act's transgender ban violates, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and \n** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the \nreader.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 6 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1083; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **1\nTitle IX. Plaintiffs challenge enforcement of the Act solely as applied to them. The district court concluded that \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal protection and Title IX claims, and preliminarily enjoined enforcing \nthe Act against them.\nThe panel held that the district court did not clearly err by finding that, before puberty, there are no significant \ndifferences [**2]  in athletic performance between boys and girls; treating small differences as insignificant; and \nfinding that transgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication do not have an athletic advantage over other \ngirls.\nThe panel affirmed the district court's holding that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal \nprotection claim. The district court did not clearly err by finding that the Act was adopted for the discriminatory \npurpose of excluding transgender girls from playing on girls' sports teams. Accordingly, the district court properly \nconcluded that the Act is subject to heightened scrutiny.\nThe panel held that Arizona's transgender ban discriminates on its face based on transgender status. To survive \nheightened scrutiny, a classification must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially \nrelated to the achievement of those objectives. The panel held that, given the district court's well-supported factual \nfindings, the district court properly concluded that Appellants—the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and \nseveral legislators—are unlikely to establish that the Act's sweeping transgender ban is substantially related to the \nachievement [**3]  of the State's important governmental objectives in ensuring competitive fairness and equal \nathletic opportunity for female student-athletes. The Act's transgender ban applies not only to all transgender \nwomen and girls in Arizona, regardless of circulating testosterone levels or other medically accepted indicia of \ncompetitive advantage, but also to all sports, regardless of the physical contact involved, the type or level of \ncompetition, or the age or grade of the participants. The district court therefore did not err by concluding that \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim. Because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non the merits of their equal protection claim, the panel did not reach the issue of whether Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their Title IX claim as well.\nThe panel held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in addressing the remaining preliminary injunction \nfactors—the likeliness of irreparable harm in the absence of relief, the balance of the equities, and the public \ninterest. Accordingly, the panel held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Plaintiffs' motion \nfor a narrow [**4]  preliminary injunction.\nCounsel: Justin R.

Each interscholastic or intramural athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a public school or a private \nschool whose students or teams compete against a public school shall be expressly designated as one of the \nfollowing based on the biological sex of the students who participate on the team or in the sport:\n1. \"Males,\" \"men\" or \"boys.\"\n2. \"Females,\" \"women\" or \"girls.\"\n3. \"Coed\" or \"mixed.\"\n [*1093]  B.

This section does not restrict the eligibility of any student to participate in any interscholastic or intramural \nathletic team or sport designated as being for \"males,\" \"men\" or \"boys\" [**15]  or designated as \"coed\" or \n\"mixed.\"\nD. A government entity, any licensing or accrediting organization or any athletic association or organization \nmay not entertain a complaint, open an investigation or take any other adverse action against a school for \nmaintaining separate interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 10 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1093; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **15\nE.

All civil actions must be initiated within two years after the alleged violation of this section occurred. A \nperson or organization that prevails on a claim brought pursuant to this section is entitled to monetary \ndamages, including damages for any psychological, emotional or physical harm suffered, reasonable attorney \nfees and costs and any other appropriate relief.\nI. For the purposes of this section, \"school\" means either:\n1. A school that provides instruction in any combination of kindergarten programs or grades one through \ntwelve.\n2. An institution of higher education.\nId. § 15-120.02. The Act's ban on transgender female students playing female sports resides in subsections A and \nB. Subsection A requires schools to classify sports and students by \"biological sex,\" and Subsection B bans \n\"students of the male sex\" from female-designated sports. The Act does not define \"biological sex,\" but the parties \nagree that the term is synonymous [**17]  with sex assigned at birth. See Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 957.2 Thus, the \nAct bans transgender women and girls from women's and girls' sports.\nAlthough the Act purports to ban all \"students of the male sex\" from female-designated athletics, including both \ncisgender male students and transgender female students, the Act in fact has no effect on the ability of cisgender \nmen and boys to engage in female sports, because they were already excluded from female sports  [*1094]  under \nthe pre-Act status quo. See, e.g., Clark ex rel. Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass'n (Clark I), 695 F.2d 1126, 1127 (9th \nCir. 1982) (upholding an Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) policy precluding cisgender boys from playing on \ngirls' teams); Clark ex rel. Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass'n (Clark II), 886 F.2d 1191, 1192, 1194 (9th Cir. 1989) \n(same). But the Act has a profound impact on transgender women and girls. Under Arizona's pre-Act status quo, \ntransgender women and girls in grade school, high school, and college were permitted to participate in women's \nand girls' sports, albeit under limited circumstances, consistent with policies established by the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association (NCAA), the AIA, and individual schools. Under current NCAA policy, for example, transgender \nwomen are permitted to compete in women's sports when they meet sport-specific standards for documented \ntestosterone  levels. [**18]   See  Transgender  Student-Athlete  Participation  Policy,  NCAA  (May  2024), \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/sports/2022/1/27/transgender-participation-policy.aspx (last visited Aug. 27, 2024). Under AIA \npolicy, which states that \"students should have the opportunity to participate in [AIA] activities in a manner that is \nconsistent with their gender identity,\" transgender female students were permitted to play on girls' teams when a \ncommittee of experts found \"that the student's request is appropriate and is not motivated by an improper purpose \nand there are no adverse health risks to the athlete.\" AIA, AIA Policies & Procedures, art. 41, § 41.9 ( 2022-23).3 \n2 Although the Act treats sex as binary (male or female), about \"two percent of all babies are born 'intersex,' or with 'a wide range \nof natural variations in physical traits—including external genitals, internal sex organs, chromosomes, and hormones—that do \nnot fit typical binary notions of male and female bodies.'\" Hecox v. Little (Hecox II), 104 F.4th 1061, 1076-77 (9th Cir. 2023), \npetition for cert. filed (U.S. July 11, 2024) (No. 24-38).\n3 The AIA is a voluntary association of public and private high schools. In the dozen or so years before the Act's passage, the \nAIA fielded approximately 12 requests from transgender students seeking to play on teams consistent with their gender identities \nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 11 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1094; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **18\nThe AIA policy also permitted each school district to set its own rules governing transgender students' participation \nin intramural—i.e., non-interscholastic—sports. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 960.\nThe Act abrogates these policies by categorically banning transgender women and girls from women's and girls' \nsports. As the district court explained, \"[u]nlike the prior case-by-case basis used to approve a transgender girl's \nrequest to play on a team consistent with her gender identity, which considered among other things the age and \ncompetitive level relevant to the request, [**19]  the Act categorically bans all transgender girls' participation.\" Id. at \n962.\nThe Act's sweeping transgender ban admits of no exceptions. The ban applies to all transgender female students, \nfrom kindergarten through graduate school; and for all sports, including intramural games, regardless of whether \nphysical contact is involved. Significantly, the ban turns entirely on a student's transgender or cisgender status, and \nnot at all on factors—such as levels of circulating testosterone—that the district court found bear a genuine \nrelationship to athletic performance and competitive advantage. The ban thus applies to many transgender women \nand girls who, according to the district court's findings, lack an athletic or competitive advantage over cisgender \nwomen and girls, including, for example: transgender girls such as kindergartners who are too young to have gone \nthrough male puberty; transgender women and girls who have received puberty-blocking medication and hormone \ntherapy and have never gone through male puberty; and transgender women and girls who have experienced male \npuberty but have received sustained hormone therapy  [*1095]  to suppress their circulating testosterone levels.\nOn its face, the Act [**20]  treats transgender women and girls less favorably than all other students. After passage \nof the Act, Arizona allows other students—including cisgender women and girls, cisgender men and boys, and \ntransgender men and boys—to play on teams corresponding with their gender identities; only transgender women \nand girls are barred from doing so.4\nThe Act also singles out women's and girls' athletics for unfavorable treatment. As the district court explained, \"[t]he \nAct's creation of a private cause of action against a school for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity \nor  suffers  any  harm,  whether  direct  or  indirect,  related  to  a  school['s]  failure  to  preclude  participation  of  a \ntransgender girl on a girls' team places an onerous burden on girls' sports programs, not faced by boys' athletic \nprograms.\" Id. at 963. \"[O]nly girls' teams fac[e] potential challenges, including litigation, related to suspected \ntransgender players.\" Id.; cf. Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1080 (holding that Idaho's transgender sports ban discriminated \nbased  on  sex  because  it  subjected  \"only  participants  in  women's  and  girls'  sports,  whether  cisgender  or \ntransgender, to the risk and humiliation of having their sex 'disputed' and then [**21]  suffering intrusive medical \ntesting [to have their biological sex verified] as a prerequisite for participation on school sports teams\").\nIn legislative findings, the Arizona Legislature suggested that a categorical transgender ban was justified because, \n\"[i]n  studies  of  large  cohorts  of  children  from  six  years  old,  '[b]oys  typically  scored  higher  than  girls  on \ncardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and speed/agility, but lower on flexibility,'\" and \n\"[t]he benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of testosterone \nsuppression.\" 2022 Ariz. Legis. Serv. ch. 106 (S.B. 1165) (West), at § 2, ¶¶ 6, 13 (second alteration in original) \nand approved seven of those requests. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 961. The record does not reveal whether these students were \ntransgender boys or transgender girls. Id.\n4 That the Act allows transgender men and boys to play on men's and boys' teams does not preclude a finding that the Act \ndiscriminates based on transgender status. As we explained in Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1079, \"a law is not immune to an equal \nprotection challenge if it discriminates only against some members of a protected class but not others.\" See, e.g., Rice v. \nCayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 516-17, 120 S. Ct. 1044, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2000) (\"Simply because a class defined by ancestry does \nnot include all members of the race does not suffice to make the classification race neutral.\"); Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9, \n97 S. Ct. 2120, 53 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1977) (\"The fact that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it does not \ndiscriminate against the class.\"); Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 504-05 n.11, 96 S. Ct. 2755, 49 L.

The legislature also found that \"[h]aving separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote \nsex equality by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and athletic abilities \nwhile  also  providing  them  with  opportunities  to  obtain  recognition,  accolades,  college  scholarships  and  the \nnumerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.\" Id. ¶ 14. In a signing statement, \nGovernor Ducey stated that the Act:\ncreates a statewide policy to ensure that biologically female athletes [**22]  at Arizona public schools, colleges, \nand universities have a level playing field to compete. This bill does not deny student-athletes the eligibility to \nplay on teams not designated as \"female,\" and it doesn't impact  [*1096]  club sports leagues offered outside of \nschools. Every young Arizona athlete should have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities that \ngive them a sense of belonging and allow them to grow and thrive.\nThis legislation simply ensures that the girls and young women who have dedicated themselves to their sport \ndo not miss out on hard-earned opportunities including their titles, standings and scholarships due to unfair \ncompetition. This bill strikes the right balance of respecting all students while still acknowledging that there are \ninherent biological distinctions that merit separate categories to ensure fairness for all.\n2022 Ariz. Legis. Serv. ch. 106 (S.B. 1165) (West) (Governor's Approval Message, Mar. 30, 2022). The Act became \neffective on September 24, 2022.\nC.\nIn April 2023, Plaintiffs Jane Doe and Megan Roe, by and through their parents, brought this as-applied challenge \nto the Act. Plaintiffs are transgender girls who have not gone through male puberty and wish to play girls' sports at \ntheir Arizona schools.\nJane is an 11-year-old transgender [**23]  girl who attends the Kyrene Aprende Middle School, a public school \nlocated in Chandler, Arizona, near Phoenix. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 958. She has lived as a girl in all aspects of \nher life since she was five years old and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at age seven. Id. She has changed \nher name through a court order to a more traditional female name, and she has a female gender marker on her \npassport. Id. at 958-59. Jane began receiving Supprelin, a puberty-blocking medication, in 2023, at age 11. Id. at \n959. The district court found that Jane will not experience any of the physiological changes that increased \ntestosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy. Id.\nSports are important to Jane, and she has played soccer for many years. Id. Aside from its physical and emotional \nhealth benefits, soccer has helped Jane make new friends and connect with other girls, and Jane's teachers, \ncoaches, friends, and members of her soccer team have all been supportive of her gender identity. Id. At Aprende, \nJane plays (or is interested in playing) on the girls' soccer, girls' basketball, and coed cross-country teams.5 Id. \nAprende, which participates in the AIA, has no objection to Jane playing on girls' teams. Id.\nMegan is a 15-year-old transgender [**24]  girl attending the Gregory School, a private school in Tucson. Id. Megan \nhas always known she is a girl, has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life since she was seven, and was diagnosed \nwith gender dysphoria at age 10. Id. at 959-60. Through a court order, Megan has changed her name to a more \ntraditional female name and her gender to female, and she has a female gender marker on her passport. Id. at \n960.6 Megan has been taking puberty blockers since she was 11 and began receiving hormone therapy at age 12. \nId. As a result of these treatments, the district court found that Megan has not experienced the physiological \nchanges that increased testosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy. Id. On the contrary, the district court \nfound that she has developed many of the physiological  [*1097]  changes associated with female puberty. Id.\n5 Boys and girls train together but compete separately on the coed cross-country team. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 959.\n6 The court ordered Megan's name changed; ordered the Office of Vital Records to amend Megan's birth record to reflect her \nnew name; and authorized Megan and her parents to correct her gender designation on her personal, vital, medical, financial, \neducational, and other public documents.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 13 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1097; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **24\nAs with Jane, sports have figured prominently in Megan's life. Id. When she was about seven, Megan joined a swim \nteam, and the coach of the swim team was supportive of her and her gender identity. Id. At the Gregory School, \nMegan is a member of the girls' volleyball team, although the Act has barred her from competing in interscholastic \ngames. Id. at 960, 962. Her teammates, coaches, and school [**25]  are all highly supportive of her and have \nwelcomed her participation on the team. Id. at 960. Like Kyrene Aprende Middle School, the Gregory School \nparticipates in the AIA.\nThe complaint alleges that the Act's transgender ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681; the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § \n794. The complaint names five defendants: Thomas C. Horne, in his official capacity as State Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction; Laura Toenjes, in her official capacity as Superintendent of the Kyrene School District; the \nKyrene School District; the Gregory School; and the AIA. In addition, Warren Petersen, President of the Arizona \nState  Senate,  and  Ben  Toma,  Speaker  of  the  Arizona  House  of  Representatives  (the  \"Legislators\"),  have \nintervened as defendants.\nPlaintiffs neither challenge the existence of separate teams for girls and boys nor challenge the Act facially. Rather, \nthey challenge enforcement of the Act solely as applied to them. They seek injunctive and declaratory relief in the \nform of an order allowing them to participate in their chosen sports.\nD.\nContemporaneous with the filing of the complaint, Plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the defendants from \nenforcing the Act as applied to them. Plaintiffs sought relief on the grounds [**26]  that they were likely to succeed \non  their  equal  protection  and  Title  IX  claims.  In  July  2023,  after  considering  the  parties'  briefs,  evidentiary \nsubmissions from numerous experts, and argument presented at a hearing, the district court granted the motion. \nDoe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 955-77. The preliminary injunction order includes a number of factual findings relevant to \nthis appeal. The district court found that \"[t]he Act was adopted for the purpose of excluding transgender girls from \nplaying on girls' sports teams.\" Id. at 963. The district court also found that, \"[b]efore puberty, there are no \nsignificant differences in athletic performance between boys and girls.\" Id. at 968. The court acknowledged studies \nshowing that prepubertal boys outperform prepubertal girls on school physical fitness tests, but the court found \"no \nbasis . . . to attribute those small differences to physiology or anatomy instead of to other factors such as greater \nsocietal encouragement of athleticism in boys, greater opportunities for boys to play sports, or differences in the \npreferences of the boys and girls surveyed.\" Id. at 966.\nThe district court also found that \"[t]he biological driver of average group differences in athletic performance \nbetween adolescent boys [**27]  and girls is the difference in their respective levels of testosterone, which only \nbegin to diverge significantly after the onset of puberty,\" and that puberty typically begins at around age 12. Id. at \n968. More specifically, the court cited \"the scientific consensus that the biological cause of average differences in \nathletic performance between men and women is . . . the presence of circulating levels of  [*1098]  testosterone \nbeginning with male puberty . . . between the ages of about 12 and 18.\" Id. at 964-65. Accordingly, the court found \nthat transgender girls such as Plaintiffs, who begin puberty-blocking medication and hormone therapy at an early \nage, \"do not have an athletic advantage over other girls.\" Id. at 964. The court found that \"[t]ransgender girls who \nreceive puberty-blocking medication do not have an athletic advantage over other girls because they do not \nundergo male puberty and do not experience the physiological changes caused by the increased production of \ntestosterone associated with male puberty.\" Id. at 968. It also found that \"[t]ransgender girls who receive hormone \ntherapy after receiving pubertyblocking medication will develop the skeletal structure, fat distribution, and muscle \nand breast development typical [**28]  of other girls\" and \"will typically have the same levels of circulating estrogen \nand testosterone as other girls.\" Id. Finally, the district court found that \"transgender girls who have not yet \nundergone male puberty or who have received puberty-blocking medication at the onset of puberty do not present \nany unique safety risk to other girls.\" Id.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 14 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1098; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **28\nOn the strength of these findings, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal \nprotection challenge to the transgender ban. As a threshold matter, the court concluded that heightened scrutiny \napplies because the Act discriminates against transgender girls both purposely and on its face. Id. at 971-72. \nApplying heightened scrutiny, the court concluded that Horne and the Legislators—the only defendants actively \ndefending the ban—failed to \"establish[] that categorically banning all transgender girls from playing girls' sports is \nsubstantially related to an important government interest.\" Id. at 973. The court concluded that their \"argument that \nthe Act is necessary to protect girls' sports by barring transgender girls, who purportedly have an unfair athletic \nadvantage over other girls and/or pose a safety risk to other girls, [**29]  is based on overbroad generalizations and \nstereotypes that erroneously equate transgender status with athletic ability.\" Id. at 973-74.\nThe district court also determined that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Title IX claim, that Plaintiffs would \nsuffer irreparable harm if relief were not granted, and that the public interest and the balance of the equities favored \nrelief. Id. at 974-76. Accordingly, the court granted Plaintiffs motion and preliminarily enjoined Horne from enforcing \nthe Act against Plaintiffs. Id. at 977. Horne and the Legislators (collectively, \"Appellants\") filed separate timely \nappeals that we subsequently consolidated.\nII.\nHN1[ ] \"The 'purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo ante litem pending a determination \nof the action on the merits.'\" Boardman v.

Specifically, Appellants argue that the district court clearly erred by: (1) finding that, before \npuberty, there are no significant differences in athletic performance between boys and girls; (2) treating small \ndifferences as insignificant; and (3) finding that transgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication do not \nhave an athletic advantage over other girls. We sustain these findings because they are not \"illogical, implausible, \nor without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record.\" United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1263 \n(9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). Appellants have not shown that the district court clearly erred.\nA.\nThe district court's finding that, \"[b]efore puberty, there are no significant differences in athletic performance \nbetween boys [**32]  and girls,\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 968, is not clearly erroneous. Dr. Daniel Shumer is a \nPediatric Endocrinologist and Medical Director of the Comprehensive Gender Services Program at Michigan \nMedicine, University of Michigan; the Clinical Director of Child and Adolescent  [*1100]  Gender Services at C.S. \nMott Children's Hospital; and an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Michigan, where the major \nfocus of his clinical and research work pertains to transgender adolescents. Shumer Decl. ¶ 3. He has personally \nevaluated and treated over 400 patients for gender dysphoria and has knowledge of the scientific literature \nconcerning the issues raised in this litigation. Id. ¶¶ 7, 14. Dr. Shumer stated that, \"[b]efore puberty, there are no \nsignificant differences in athletic performance between boys and girls.\" Id. ¶ 38. He acknowledged that \"some \nstudies have found small differences between the performance of boys and girls with respect to some discrete \nactivities,\"  but  he  noted  that  \"these  studies  did  not  control  for  other  factors,  particularly  age,  location,  or \nsocioeconomic factors.\" Rebuttal Decl. of Daniel Shumer, M.D., ¶ 10. He further explained, \"When research has \ncontrolled for those factors by using [**33]  representative data, researchers have found . . . 'no statistical difference \nin the capabilities of girls and boys until high-school age (commonly age 12).'\" Id. ¶ 11. According to Dr. Shumer, \n\"[t]here is no reliable basis . . . to attribute those small differences to physiology or anatomy instead of other factors, \nsuch as greater societal encouragement of athleticism in boys, greater opportunities for boys to play sports, or \ndifferent preferences of the boys and girls surveyed.\" Id. ¶ 13; see also Second Rebuttal Decl. of Daniel Shumer, \nM.D., ¶¶ 16-24.\nAppellants point to a handful of studies suggesting that prepubertal boys may be taller, weigh more, have more \nmuscle mass, have less body fat, or have greater shoulder internal rotator strength than prepubertal girls. These \nstudies, however, neither attributed these differences to biological rather than sociological factors nor concluded \nthat these differences translated into competitive athletic advantages. Moreover, the results of these studies are \ndisputed. Dr. Shumer, for example, testified that studies have found \"no statistical difference in the [muscle \nstrength] of girls and boys until high-school age\" and that height differences [**34]  between boys and girls \n\"disappear around age 6 to 8 years of age, and do not begin diverging again until puberty,\" when girls acquire an \nadvantage. Shumer 2d Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 13, 18. On appeal, Appellants cite the findings of these studies selectively. \nFor example, although a 2017 study found that prepubertal boys had greater shoulder internal rotator strength than \nprepubertal girls, the study also found \"no significant . . . differences between strength measures of boys or girls \naged 3-9 years\" with respect to the 12 other muscle groups studied. Marnee J. McKay et al., Normative Reference \nValues for Strength and Flexibility of 1,000 Children and Adults, 88 Neurology 36, 38 (2017). And Appellants' \nreliance on a 2023 study, Mira A. Atkinson et al., Sex Differences in Track and Field Elite Youth 10-11 (2023) \n(preprint), https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/324/65 4 (last visited Aug. 27, 2024), is misplaced \nbecause it does not appear that Appellants presented this evidence to the district court. HN3[ ] \"Our review of the \ndistrict court's findings, pursuant to its action on a motion for preliminary judgment is . . . restricted to the limited \nrecord available to the district court when it granted or denied [**35]  the motion.\" Sports Form, Inc. v. United Press \nInt'l, Inc., 686 F.2d 750, 753 (9th Cir. 1982).\nOn the record before it, the district court did not clearly err by finding that there are no significant differences in \nathletic performance between prepubescent boys and girls. We recognize that Appellants' experts—including Dr. \nEmma Hilton, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in developmental biology at the University of Manchester, UK, and \nDr. Gregory A. Brown, Ph.D., FACSM, a Professor of Exercise  [*1101]  Science in the Department of Kinesiology \nand Sport Sciences at the University of Nebraska Kearney—disagree with these findings, but our review of a district \nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 16 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1101; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **35\ncourt's  factual  findings  is  limited  and  deferential,  especially  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings.  Because  the \nchallenged findings are firmly grounded in evidence in the record, they are not clearly erroneous.\nB.\nAppellants contend the district court clearly erred by treating small differences between prepubertal boys and girls \nas insignificant. They note that small differences can \"have an enormous influence in competitive sports, where \noutcomes are routinely decided by tiny margins.\" Opening Br. at 56. Appellants overlook the court's finding that the \nsmall differences that have been identified by some studies have not been [**36]  shown to be attributable to \nbiological rather than sociological factors. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 966. The court found that \"any prepubertal \ndifferences between boys and girls in various athletic measurements are minimal or nonexistent\" and that there is \n\"no basis . . . to attribute\" the small differences observed in school-based fitness testing of prepubertal boys and \ngirls \"to physiology or anatomy instead of to other factors such as greater societal encouragement of athleticism in \nboys, greater opportunities for boys to play sports, or differences in the preferences of the boys and girls surveyed.\" \nId. at 966-67. These findings are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous.7\nC.\nAppellants also take issue with the district court's finding that \"[t]ransgender girls who receive puberty-blocking \nmedication do not have an athletic advantage over other girls because they do not undergo male puberty and do \nnot experience the physiological changes caused by the increased production of testosterone associated with male \npuberty.\" Id. at 968. Appellants point to what they describe as \"abundant evidence showing that preventing male \npuberty does not eliminate the advantages that [transgender females] have over [cisgender] females.\" [**37]  \nOpening Br. at 52.\nThe district court's finding is grounded in the record evidence. Dr. Shumer testified that transgender girls receiving \ntreatment consistent with current standards of care begin puberty blockers \"at the first onset of puberty, . . . long \nbefore the development of increased muscle mass and strength associated with the later stages of male puberty,\" \nand \"receive hormone therapy to allow them to go through puberty consistent with their female gender identity.\" \nShumer 2d Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 26-27. Consequently, Dr. Shumer testified that these transgender girls \"will develop \nmany of the same physiological and anatomical characteristics of non-transgender girls, including bone size, \nskeletal structure, and distinctive aspects of the female pelvis geometry that cut against athletic performance. . . . \nBecause such girls do not undergo male puberty, they do not gain the increased muscle mass or strength that \naccounts for why post-pubertal boys as a group have an advantage over post-pubertal girls as a group.\" Id. ¶¶ 27-\n28. Dr. Shumer testified, there is \"no evidence that transgender girls on puberty suppression medication or \nhormone therapy have an athletic advantage over other [**38]  girls,\"  [*1102]  there are \"no studies that have \ndocumented any such advantage,\" and there is \"no medical reason to posit that any such advantage would exist.\" \nId. ¶ 36; see also Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 14-27. Dr. Shumer also cited \"the scientific consensus that the \nbiological cause of average differences in athletic performance between men and women is the rise of circulating \nlevels of testosterone beginning in endogenous male puberty.\" Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶ 8. Dr. Shumer further \ntestified that \"a transgender girl who receives hormone therapy will typically have the same levels of circulating \nestrogen and testosterone levels as other girls.\" Shumer Decl. ¶ 36.\nRelying  on  several  studies,  Appellants  argue  that  transgender  females  who  receive  puberty  blockers  have \nadvantages over cisgender females in lean body mass, grip strength, and height. But Appellants overlook that in \nthese studies, male puberty was only partially blocked. In the lean body mass study, for example, the transgender \nwomen participants \"had much more testosterone exposure than transgender girls treated with modern protocols\" \nbecause they started puberty blockers at an average age of 14.5 years.

Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200-01 (9th Cir. 2019), and Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1079, we held \nthat  heightened  scrutiny  applies  to  laws  that  discriminate  based  on  transgender  status.  Thus,  if  the  Act \ndiscriminates based on transgender status, either purposefully or on its face, heightened scrutiny applies.8\n [*1103]  a.\nHN5[ ] A discriminatory purpose is shown when \"the decisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or \nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon \nan identifiable group.\" Pers.

United States v. Carrillo-Lopez, 68 F.4th 1133, 1139-40 (9th Cir. \n8 We recognize that the Act also classifies based on sex, but Plaintiffs do not challenge the State's decision to require that \nschools maintain separate teams for girls and boys, so we do not address it.

Here, the district court found that \"[t]he Act was adopted for the purpose of excluding transgender girls from \nplaying on girls' sports teams.\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 963. This finding is not clearly erroneous.\nFirst, Appellants' contention that the legislature adopted the Act to ensure competitive fairness and equal athletic \nopportunities for cisgender female athletes cannot be squared with the fact that the Act bars students from female \nathletics based entirely on transgender status and not at all based on factors the district court found bear a genuine \nconnection to athletic performance and competitive advantage, such as circulating [**42]  testosterone. The district \ncourt concluded that \"[t]he Arizona legislature intentionally created a classification, specifically 'biological girls,' that \nnecessarily excludes transgender girls,\" id. at 971, and that \"[t]he categorical preclusion of transgender women, \nespecially girls who have not experienced male puberty, appears unrelated to the interests the Act purportedly \nadvances,\" id. at 967.\nHN6[ ] Second, the Supreme Court has long recognized that a policy's discriminatory impact may support a \nfinding of discriminatory purpose. See Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S. Ct. 3211, 73 L. Ed. 2d \n948  (1982)  (\"In  determining  whether  .  .  .  a  [discriminatory]  purpose  was  the  motivating  factor,  the  racially \ndisproportionate effect of official action provides 'an important starting point.'\" (quoting Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274 (in \nturn  quoting  Village  of  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  266))).  Here,  the  Act's  transgender  ban  affects  only \ntransgender female students. To be sure, the statutory language bans all \"students of the male sex\" from female \nsports. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(B). But Appellants have not shown that the Act had any real-world impact on \ncisgender male students, who have long been excluded from female sports in Arizona and elsewhere.  [*1104]  See \nClark I, 695 F.2d at 1127; Clark II, 886 F.2d at 1192.9\nThe Act's burdens instead fall exclusively on transgender women and girls. Under the pre-Act [**43]  status quo, \ntransgender women and girls were permitted to participate in women's and girls' sports consistent with AIA, NCAA, \nand  individual-school  policies.  The  Act  functions  solely  to  abrogate  those  policies,  and  thus  burdens  only \ntransgender female students. Cf. Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1077 (\"[T]he Act's discriminatory purpose is . . . evidenced \nby the Act's prohibition of 'biological males' from female-designated teams because that prohibition affects one \ngroup of athletes only—transgender women. . . . The Act's only contribution to Idaho's student-athletic landscape is \nto entirely exclude transgender women and girls from participating on female sports teams.\"); B.P.J., 98 F.4th at \n556 (applying heightened scrutiny where the challenged legislation's \"only effect\" was \"to exclude transgender girls \n. . . from participation on girls sports teams\").10\nIn sum, the district court did not clearly err by finding a discriminatory purpose. Accordingly, the district court \nproperly concluded that the Act is subject to heightened scrutiny on this basis.\nb.\nTurning to facial discrimination, Appellants contend the Act \"is 'facially' neutral with respect to gender identity\" \nbecause it \"describes who may play on what sports teams 'without referring [**44]  to' gender identity.\" Opening Br. \n9 Appellants contend the Act affects cisgender males because there was no state law explicitly barring cisgender males from \nfemale sports before the Act's adoption and because AIA and NCAA policies excluding cisgender males from female sports \napplied only to member schools, not to other schools, and only to colleges and high schools, not to kindergarten through eighth \ngrade. This argument fails because the Act merely codifies preexisting rules barring cisgender males from participating on girls' \nsports teams, and it had no practical effect on cisgender males.\n10 The district court also found evidence of discriminatory purpose in the legislative history, noting that Senator Vince Leach \nexplained his vote for the bill by stating, \"if we allow transgenders to take over female sports, you will not have females \nparticipating,\" and that Senator Petersen, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, questioned whether critics of the bill \nwould \"be opposed to having just a trans league, so that they can all compete in their own league.\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 963. \nSpeakers at the legislative hearing on the bill also referred to transgender women and girls as \"males\" and \"men.\" See Hearing \non  Senate  Bill  1165,  Arizona  State  Senate,  Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  Jan.  20,  2022,  available  at \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022011057&startStreamAt=508 (last visited Aug. 27, 2024).\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 19 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1104; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **44\nat 32. They rely on Martin v. International Olympic Committee, 740 F.2d 670, 678 (9th Cir. 1984), which held that an \nIOC rule was gender neutral because it \"describe[d] the procedures for determining events to be included in the \nOlympic Games without referring to the competitors' sex.\" Under circuit precedent, however, the Act discriminates \non its face based on transgender status.\nIn Latta v. Otter, 771 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2014), we held that state laws defining marriage as between a man and a \nwoman, but making no mention of sexual orientation, discriminated on their face based on sexual orientation. Id. at \n464 n.2, 467-68. Although the challenged laws prohibited all same-sex couples from marrying, whether gay or \nstraight, the laws facially discriminated based on sexual orientation because only gay couples were barred from \nmarrying consistent with their sexual orientation. This precedent applies here. The Act bars all \"students of the male \nsex\" from playing on female teams, but only transgender female students are  [*1105]  prohibited from playing on \nteams consistent with their gender identity, and this distinction is plain from the face of the statute. Thus, under \nLatta, the Act discriminates on its face based on transgender status.\nIn Hecox II, moreover, we held that an Idaho transgender ban similar to [**45]  the Arizona law challenged here \ndiscriminated on its face based on transgender status. We reasoned that \"the Act's use of 'biological sex' functions \nas a form of '[p]roxy discrimination'\" because the Act's \"definition of 'biological sex'\" was \"carefully drawn to target \ntransgender women and girls, even if it does not use the word 'transgender' in the definition.\" Hecox II, 104 F.4th at \n1078 (quoting Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of Newport Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1160 n.23 (9th Cir. 2013)).11 We \nreach the same conclusion here; under Hecox II, Arizona's transgender ban discriminates on its face based on \ntransgender status.\nThis conclusion is consistent not only with common sense—there is simply no denying that a transgender sports \nban discriminates based [**46]  on transgender status—but also with the decisions of other courts, which have held \nthat transgender sports bans like the one challenged here discriminate on their face against transgender women \nand girls. See id. (\"In addition to having a discriminatory purpose and effect, the Act is also facially discriminatory \nagainst transgender female athletes.\"); B.P.J., 98 F.4th at 555-56 (\"If B.P.J. were a cisgender girl, she could play on \nher school's girls teams. Because she is a transgender girl, she may not. The Act declares a person's sex is defined \nonly by their 'reproductive biology and genetics at birth.' The undisputed purpose—and the only effect—of that \ndefinition is to exclude transgender girls from the definition of 'female' and thus to exclude them from participation \non girls sports teams. That is a facial classification based on gender identity.\"); Hecox v. Little (Hecox I), 479 F. \nSupp. 3d 930, 975 (D. Idaho 2020) (\"[T]he Act on its face discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may \ncompete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not \ncompete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\").\nc.\nCiting Katzenbach v.

New York State Department of Economic Development, 438 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 2006), Appellants argue that \nrational  basis  review  applies  to  the  Plaintiffs'  equal  protection  claim [**47]   because  Plaintiffs  assert  an \nunderinclusiveness challenge to a remedial statute.\n11 In Pacific Shores Properties, we explained:\nHN7[ ] Proxy discrimination is a form of facial discrimination. It arises when the defendant enacts a law or policy that \ntreats individuals differently on the basis of seemingly neutral criteria that are so closely associated with the disfavored \ngroup that discrimination on the basis of such criteria is, constructively, facial discrimination against the disfavored group. \nFor example, discriminating against individuals with gray hair is a proxy for age discrimination because \"the 'fit' between \nage and gray hair is sufficiently close.\"\n730 F.3d at 1160 n.23 (quoting McWright v. Alexander, 982 F.2d 222, 228 (7th Cir. 1992)).\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 20 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1105; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **47\nIn Morgan, 384 U.S. at 656, the Supreme Court considered a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge to a \nVoting Rights Act provision prohibiting states from denying the vote to some non-English speakers (those educated \nin schools in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories) but not to other non-English speakers (those educated beyond \nU.S. territories). Although classifications based on national origin ordinarily trigger strict scrutiny, the Court held that \nrational basis  [*1106]  review applied because \"the distinction challenged by appellees is presented only as a \nlimitation on a reform measure aimed at eliminating an existing barrier to the exercise of the franchise.\" Id. at 657. \nThe Court noted that a \"statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did,\" \nthat a legislature need not \"strike at all evils at the same time,\" and that \"reform may take one step at a time, \naddressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.\" Id. (first quoting \nRoschen v. Ward, 279 U.S. 337, 339, 49 S. Ct. 336, 73 L. Ed. 722 (1929), then quoting Semler v. Oregon State Bd. \nof Dental Examiners, 294 U.S. 608, 610, 55 S. Ct. 570, 79 L. Ed. 1086 (1935), and then quoting Williamson v. Lee \nOptical of Okla. Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563 (1955)). In Jana-Rock, the Second Circuit \nconsidered a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge to a New York affirmative action program providing \nbenefits [**48]  to some Hispanics (those from Latin America) but not to other Hispanics (those from Spain and \nPortugal). Although racial classifications ordinarily prompt strict scrutiny, the Second Circuit applied rational basis \nreview because \"once the government has shown that its decision to resort to explicit racial classifications survives \nstrict scrutiny by being narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest, its program is no longer presumptively \nsuspect.\" 438 F.3d at 200. The court declined \"to apply automatically strict scrutiny a second time in determining \nwhether an otherwise valid affirmative action program is underinclusive for having excluded a particular plaintiff.\" \nId.; see also id. at 206-11.\nRelying on Morgan and Jana-Rock, Appellants argue that rational basis review applies here. They argue that the \nAct \"is a remedial statute\" because \"[t]he Arizona legislature passed the law to provide girls and women a benefit—\nparticipation on their own sports teams—for the purpose of promoting opportunities for female athletes, ensuring \nthe safety of female athletes, and remedying past discrimination.\" Opening Br. at 18. Further, they argue that \nPlaintiffs' equal protection claim should be understood as an underinclusiveness challenge [**49]  because, rather \nthan challenging Arizona's adoption of \"sex-segregated sports teams,\" in their view Plaintiffs' claim is \"that the \ndefinition of 'females,' 'women,' and 'girls' in the [Act] is underinclusive—that the definition should be expanded to \ninclude not just biological females, but also at least some biological males who identify as females, i.e., transgender \nathletes like themselves.\" Id. at 2.\nAppellants' argument rests on the flawed premise that the Act qualifies as remedial legislation. The district court \nfound that \"[t]he Act was adopted for the purpose of excluding transgender girls from playing on girls' sports teams,\" \nDoe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 963, and, as discussed earlier, that finding is not clearly erroneous. Thus, the Act is not \nremedial,  and  Morgan  and  Jana-Rock  do  not  control.  HN8[ ]  Furthermore,  even  in  the  context  of  an \nunderinclusiveness challenge to a remedial statute, heightened scrutiny applies where, as here, the plaintiff \n\"demonstrate[s] that his or her exclusion was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\" Jana-Rock, 428 F.3d at 200. \nThus, even under Jana-Rock, heightened scrutiny applies here.\n2.\nHN9[ ] To withstand heightened scrutiny, a classification \"must serve important governmental objectives and must \nbe substantially related to achievement [**50]  of those objectives.\" Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1129 (quoting Craig v. \nBoren, 429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1976)). The State bears the burden of demonstrating an \n\"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for the classification, United States v. Virginia,  [*1107]  518 U.S. 515, 531, \n116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996), and \"[t]he justification . . . must not rely on overbroad generalizations \nabout the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females,\" id. at 533. Here, it is undisputed that \nthe State's asserted interests in ensuring competitive fairness, student safety, and equal athletic opportunities for \nwomen  and  girls  are  important  governmental  objectives.  The  question  is  whether  the  transgender  ban  is \nsubstantially related to the achievement of these objectives.\nFour decades ago, we addressed whether an Arizona policy excluding cisgender boys from girls' sports violated the \nEqual Protection Clause. We upheld that policy because it was substantially related to the state's objectives in \nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 21 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1107; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **50\n\"redressing past discrimination against women in athletics and promoting equality of athletic opportunity between \nthe sexes.\" Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131. We reached that conclusion because: (1) \"boys' overall opportunity\" to play \nschool sports was \"not inferior to girls'\"; (2) \"males would displace females to a substantial extent\" if cisgender boys \nwere allowed to play on girls' teams; and (3), most importantly, [**51]  \"average physiological differences\" between \nboys and girls \"allow[ed] gender to be used as . . . an accurate proxy\" for athletic ability and competitive advantage. \nId. (emphasis added). None of these conditions is present here.12\nFirst, the Act does not afford transgender women and girls equal athletic opportunities. The Act permits cisgender \nwomen and girls to play on any teams, male or female, while transgender women and girls are permitted to play \nonly on male teams. The Act also permits all students other than transgender women and girls to play on teams \nconsistent with their gender identities; transgender women and girls alone are barred from doing so. This is the \nessence of discrimination. See Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 657, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218 \n(2020) (\"HN10[ ] To 'discriminate against' a person . . . mean[s] treating that individual worse than others who are \nsimilarly situated.\").\nAlthough the Act allows transgender women and girls to play male sports, the district court found that Plaintiffs \n\"cannot play on boys' sports teams.\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 968. The court reasoned that Plaintiffs have \"athletic \ncapabilities like other girls [their] age,\" that they would find playing on boys' teams \"humiliating and embarrassing,\" \nand that \"playing on a [**52]  boys' sports team and competing against boys would directly contradict [their] medical \ntreatment  for  gender  dysphoria  and  jeopardize  [their]  health.\"  Id.  at  968-69.  In  fact,  the  court  found  that \n\"[p]articipating in sports on teams that contradict one's gender identity is equivalent to gender identity conversion \nefforts, which every major medical association has found to be dangerous and unethical.\" Id. (quoting Hecox I, 479 \nF. Supp. 3d at 977). As we explained in Hecox II, \"[t]he argument . . . that the Act does not discriminate against \ntransgender women because they can . . . play on men's teams is akin to the argument we rejected in Latta[] that \nsame-sex marriage bans do not discriminate against gay men because they are free to marry someone of the \nopposite sex.\" 104 F.4th at 1083 (citing Latta, 771 F.3d at 467).13\n [*1108]  Second, the record does not demonstrate that transgender females would displace cisgender females to a \nsubstantial extent if transgender females were allowed to play on female teams. As the district court noted in \ndistinguishing Clark I, \"[i]t is inapposite to compare the potential displacement [of] allowing approximately half of the \npopulation (cisgender men) to compete with cisgender women, with any potential displacement one half of one \npercent of the [**53]  population (transgender women) could cause cisgender women.\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 961 \n(footnote omitted) (quoting Hecox I, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977). In the dozen or so years before adoption of the Act, \nthe AIA approved just seven transgender students to play on teams consistent with their gender identities—a tiny \nnumber when compared to the roughly 170,000 students playing school sports in Arizona each year. Id. During \nlegislative hearings, proponents of the Act were unable to cite a single instance of a transgender girl displacing a \ncisgender girl on a girls' sports team in Arizona.\n12 As we noted in Hecox II, Clark I is also distinguishable from this case because the policy challenged in Clark I adversely \naffected cisgender boys, a historically favored group, rather than transgender women and girls, a historically disfavored minority. \nHecox II, 104 F.4th at 1082.\n13 HN11[ ] The generally accepted medical practice is to treat people who suffer from gender dysphoria with \"necessary, safe, \nand effective\" gender-affirming medical care. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 957. \"The goal of medical treatment for gender dysphoria \nis to alleviate a transgender patient's distress by allowing them to live consistently with their gender identity.\" Id. at 958. This \ntreatment, \"commonly referred to as 'transition,'\" includes \"one or more of the following components: (i) social transition, \nincluding adopting a new name, pronouns, appearance, and clothing, and correcting identity documents; (ii) medical transition, \nincluding puberty-delaying medication and hormone-replacement therapy; and (iii) for adults, surgeries to alter the appearance \nand functioning of primary- and secondary-sex characteristics.\" Id. \"For social transition to be clinically effective, it must be \nrespected consistently across all aspects of a transgender individual's life.\" Id.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 22 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1108; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **53\nThird, after carefully considering the extensive expert evidence in the preliminary injunction record, the district court \nfound that a student's transgender status is not an accurate proxy for average athletic ability or competitive \nadvantage. As noted, the district court cited \"the scientific consensus\" that \"the biological cause of average \ndifferences  in  athletic  performance  between  men  and  women  is  .  .  .  the  presence  of  circulating  levels  of \ntestosterone beginning with male puberty,\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 964, and that \"[t]he biological driver of average \ngroup differences in athletic performance between adolescent boys and girls is the difference in their respective \nlevels of testosterone, [**54]  which only begin to diverge significantly after the onset of puberty,\" id. at 968.\nContrary to the expert opinion evidence relied upon by the district court, the Act applies to all transgender women \nand girls, including those who the district court found do not have an average athletic advantage over cisgender \nwomen and girls. The district court found that, \"[b]efore puberty, there are no significant differences in athletic \nperformance between boys and girls,\" id., yet the ban applies to transgender kindergartners who are too young to \nhave experienced male puberty. Although prepubertal boys sometimes outperform prepubertal girls on school-\nbased fitness testing, the district court found \"no basis . . . to attribute those small differences to physiology or \nanatomy instead of\" sociological factors. Id. at 966.\nThe categorical ban includes transgender women and girls, such as Plaintiffs, who receive puberty blockers and \nhormone therapy and never experience male puberty. The district court found that \"[t]ransgender girls who receive \npuberty-blocking medication do not have an athletic advantage over other girls because they do not undergo male \npuberty  and  do  not  experience  the  physiological  changes  caused  by [**55]   the  increased  production  of \ntestosterone associated with male puberty.\" Id. at 968. The court also found that \"[t]ransgender girls who receive \nhormone therapy after receiving puberty-blocking medication will develop the skeletal structure, fat distribution, \n [*1109]  and muscle and breast development typical of other girls,\" and \"will typically have the same levels of \ncirculating estrogen and testosterone as other girls.\" Id.14\nGiven these well-supported factual findings, the district court properly concluded that Appellants are unlikely to \nestablish that the Act's sweeping transgender ban is substantially related to achievement of the State's important \ngovernmental objectives in ensuring competitive fairness and equal athletic opportunity for female student-athletes. \nHN12[ ] The Act's transgender ban applies not only to all transgender women and girls in Arizona, regardless of \ncirculating testosterone levels or other medically accepted indicia of competitive advantage, but also to all sports, \nregardless of the physical contact involved, the type or level of competition, or the age or grade of the participants. \nHeightened scrutiny does not require narrow tailoring, but [**56]  it does require a substantial relationship between \nthe ends sought and the discriminatory means chosen to achieve them. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. Appellants \nhave not made that showing here.\nWe recognize that the research in this field is ongoing and that standards governing transgender participation in \nsports are evolving. In the last few years alone, both the NCAA and International Olympic Committee have \ntightened their transgender eligibility policies—although neither organization has adopted anything like Arizona's \ncategorical ban on transgender females participating in female sports. HN13[ ] Legislatures are not prohibited \nfrom acting \"in the face of medical uncertainty,\" Carhart, 550 U.S. at 166, and \"[l]ife-tenured federal judges should \nbe wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by \nconstruing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, \n471 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 2679, 219 L. Ed. 2d 1297, 2024 WL 3089532 (U.S. June 24, 2024) \n(No. 23-477). But neither Carhart nor Skrmetti applied heightened scrutiny, as we are obliged to do, and that \nstandard  requires  the  State  to  demonstrate  an  \"exceedingly  persuasive  justification\"  for  a  discriminatory \n14 The Act also includes transgender women and girls who have gone through male puberty but receive gender-affirming \nhormone therapy to suppress their circulating testosterone levels. Dr. Shumer testified that \"studies on transgender women who \nhave undergone testosterone suppression as adults . . . show that testosterone suppression resulted in significant mitigation of \nmuscle mass and development in adult transgender women.\" See Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 17-18. These transgender women \ndo not appear to have a competitive athletic advantage. See id. ¶ 19 (citing Joanna Harper, Race Times for Transgender \nAthletes, 6 J. Sporting Cultures & Identities 1 (2015)).\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 23 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1109; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **56\nclassification,  without  relying  on  \"overbroad  generalizations  about  the  different  talents,  capacities,  or \npreferences [**57]  of males and females.\" Virginia, 518 U.S. at 531, 533.15 The district court was bound to rule on \nPlaintiffs' request for limited injunctive relief based on the evidence in the record before it. To be sure, future cases \nmay have different outcomes if the evolving science supports different findings. But the court did not have the luxury \nof waiting for further research to be conducted; \"we cannot avoid the duty to decide an issue squarely presented to \nus.\" United States v. Booker, 375 F.3d 508, 513 (7th Cir. 2004),  [*1110]  aff'd, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. \nEd. 2d 621 (2005).\nWe reject Appellants' argument that the Act survives intermediate scrutiny because it directly advances the State's \nobjectives \"roughly 99.996 percent of the time.\" Reply Br. at 26. In Appellants' view, even if the ban does not \ndirectly advance the State's legitimate objectives as applied to transgender women and girls who have not \nexperienced male puberty, such as Plaintiffs, the Act is substantially related to the State's interests because it \nadvances legitimate State interests as applied to cisgender men and boys, who make up the vast majority of \nstudents affected by the legislation. Because, as noted, the Act does not actually affect cisgender men and boys, \nthis argument is unpersuasive.16\nSo, too, is Appellants' argument that the Act satisfies [**58]  heightened scrutiny because it directly advances the \nState's objectives as applied to some transgender female athletes—those who have experienced male puberty and \nwho have not received hormone therapy to suppress their levels of circulating testosterone. HN14[ ] Appellants \ncorrectly point out that \"[n]one of [the Supreme Court's] gender-based classification equal protection cases have \nrequired that the statute under consideration must be capable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance.\" \nTuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 70, 121 S. Ct. 2053, 150 L. Ed. 2d 115 (2001). But the State does not carry \nits burden by showing that a classification is capable of achieving its ultimate objective in some circumstances. \nHeightened scrutiny requires that the means adopted by the State must be \"in substantial furtherance of important \ngovernmental objectives.\" Id. (emphasis added). Moreover, the Act's practical effect is to displace the existing AIA \nand NCAA policies which already limit the participation of transgender athletes based in part on levels of circulating \ntestosterone.\nB.\nThe district court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed not only on their equal protection claim but also on \ntheir Title IX claim. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 974-75. Appellants challenge this conclusion, arguing that [**59]  Title \nIX is unenforceable in this case because the State lacked clear notice that excluding transgender women and girls \nfrom female sports violates the statute. See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296, \n126 S. Ct. 2455, 165 L. Ed. 2d 526 (2006) (\"HN15[ ] Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it \ndisburses federal money to the States, but when Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal \nfunds, the conditions must be set out 'unambiguously.'\" (citations omitted) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1981))).\nAlthough not addressed by the district court, this is a colorable argument because Title IX regulations permit \nschools to \"operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex,\" 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), and it may not \nhave been clear to the State when it accepted federal funding that this provision does not authorize distinctions \nbased on assigned sex. Cf. Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 815-16 (11th Cir. \n2022) (en banc) (\"Under the Spending Clause's required clear-statement rule, the School Board's interpretation that \n15 See Carhart, 550 U.S. at 166 (addressing whether the challenged law was \"rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends\"); \nSkrmetti, 83 F.4th at 486 (applying rational basis review to an equal protection challenge to state laws prohibiting doctors from \nproviding gender-affirming medical care to minors).\n16 Because Plaintiffs do  not challenge the Act's sex classification, the  question presented is simply whether \"excluding \ntransgender girls from girls sports teams\" is substantially related to important governmental interests, not whether excluding all \n\"students of the male sex\" from such sports is justified. See B.P.J., 98 F.4th at 559.\nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 24 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1110; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **59\n[Title IX's] bathroom carve-out[, 34 C.F.R. § 106.33,] pertains to biological sex would only violate  [*1111]  Title IX if \nthe meaning of 'sex' unambiguously meant something other than biological sex, thereby providing the notice to the \nSchool Board that its understanding of the word 'sex' was incorrect.\").17\nWe need not address this issue at this time. Because Secretary [**60]  Horne (the only party formally enjoined by \nthe preliminary injunction, see Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 977) was properly enjoined based on the district court's \nconclusion that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim, we need not decide \nwhether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX claim as well. The district court should address \nthe Spending Clause issue in the first instance if raised in further proceedings. We express no opinion on how the \nissue should be resolved.\nV.\nHaving determined that the district court did not err by concluding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their equal \nprotection claim, we turn to whether the district court abused its discretion in addressing the remaining preliminary \ninjunction factors.\nA.\nHN16[ ] Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of relief. Johnson, 572 F.3d at 1078. Appellants argue that\n\"Plaintiffs' claim of irreparable harm is inconsistent with their delay in seeking injunctive relief,\" because \"[n]early a \nyear passed . . . before they challenged\" the Act. Opening Br. at 67. See Oakland Trib., Inc. v. Chron. Pub. Co., 762 \nF.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (\"Plaintiff's long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of \nurgency and [**61]  irreparable harm.\"); see also Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015) (en \nbanc) (noting that delay can undercut a claim of irreparable harm).\nWe disagree. Plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive relief just seven months after the Act took effect. This was not a \nlong delay in this context, and even if it were, \"delay is but a single factor to consider in evaluating irreparable \ninjury,\" and \"'courts are loath to withhold relief solely on that ground.'\" Arc of California, 757 F.3d at 990 (quoting \nLydo Enters., Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir. 1984)). Furthermore, even a long delay \"is \nnot particularly probative in the context of ongoing, worsening injuries.\" Id.18\nAppellants argue that Plaintiffs fail to show irreparable harm because their \"claims of harm stem from their gender \ndysphoria diagnosis\" rather than the Act. Opening Br. at 68. This misunderstands Plaintiffs' claims. It is Plaintiffs' \ngender  [*1112]  identity, not their gender dysphoria, that causes them to wish to play on girls' teams, and it is the \nAct, not their medical condition, that prevents them from doing so. HN17[ ] In any event, we ordinarily will not \nconsider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.19\n17 The Department of Education has proposed an amendment to § 106.41(b) that would clarify that Title IX does not authorize \nthe categorical exclusion of transgender female students from female sports. See Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in \nEducation Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance: Sex-Related Eligibility Criteria for Male and Female \nAthletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. 22,860 (proposed Apr. 13, 2023) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)(2)).\n18 Jane was not affected by the transgender ban during the 2023-24 school year. She played soccer on club and recreational \nteams, which were not subject to the ban. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(A) (applying only to school-sponsored sports); Doe, \n683 F. Supp. 3d at 959. Megan was affected by the ban in 2023-24; she was a member of the girls' volleyball team at the \nGregory School and was allowed to practice with the team but barred from playing in games. Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 962. \nMegan would have been irreparably harmed were she barred from playing in games for a second school year.\n19 Appellants point out that \"it is claims that are deemed waived or forfeited, not arguments.\" United States v. Blackstone, 903 \nF.3d 1020, 1025 n.2 (9th Cir. 2018) HN18[ ] (quoting United States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004)); \nsee Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 487, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2008) (\"[O]nce a federal claim is \nIsabel Bysiewicz\nPage 25 of 26\n\n115 F.4th 1083, *1112; 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 22847, **61\nB.\nAppellants argue that the final two preliminary injunction factors—the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest—favor the denial of [**62]  preliminary injunctive relief because \"Plaintiffs will displace biological female \nathletes\" if they are allowed to play on girls' teams. Opening Br. at 69. The record, however, shows that \"Megan's \nteammates, coaches, and school are highly supportive of her and would welcome her participation on the girls' \nvolleyball team,\" Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 960, and that \"Jane's teachers, coaches, friends, and members of her \nsoccer team have all been supportive of Jane's identity,\" id. at 959. Appellants have not shown that Plaintiffs would \ndisplace other students. HN19[ ] In any case, \"it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's \nconstitutional rights.\" Melendres, 695 F.3d at 1002 (quoting Sammartano, 303 F.3d at 974).\nVI.\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Plaintiffs' motion for a narrow preliminary \ninjunction. We note that nothing in today's decision, or in the district court's decision, precludes policymakers from \nadopting appropriate regulations in this field—regulations that are substantially related to important governmental \nobjectives.  See  Clark  I,  695  F.2d  at  1129.  States  have  important  interests  in  inclusion,  nondiscrimination, \ncompetitive fairness, student safety, and completing the still unfinished and important job of ensuring equal \nathletic [**63]  opportunities for women and girls, who must have an equal opportunity not only to participate in \nsports but also to compete and win. We hold only that the district court did not abuse its discretion by enjoining \nArizona from barring Jane and Megan from playing school sports consistent with their gender identity while this \nlitigation is pending.\nAFFIRMED.\nEnd of Document\nproperly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they \nmade below.\" (quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S. Ct. 1522, 118 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1992))). But these decisions \ndo not alter our general rule that we ordinarily do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. See Exxon \nShipping, 554 U.S. at 487 (\"'It is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed \nupon below,' when to deviate from this rule being a matter 'left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised \non the facts of individual cases'\" (citations omitted) (quoting Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 49 L. Ed. \n2d 826 (1976))); Bolker v.

Movants filed their motion to stay \nwith the district court on the second business day after the court’s preliminary \ninjunction order. \nUnder the district court’s preliminary injunction order, “the [Save Women’s \nSports] Act  shall  not  prevent  Plaintiffs  from  participating  in  girls’  sports”  and \n“Plaintiffs shall be allowed to play girls’ sports at their respective schools.”  A43.  \nAny success by Plaintiffs in try-outs and meets will displace biological girls from \nmaking a team, getting playing time, and succeeding in final results.  Biological girls \nwill be irreparably harmed if they are displaced by, forced to compete against, or risk \ninjury from Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs represented that the earliest sports activity affected by the Save \nWomen’s Sports Act was cross-country at Kyrene Middle School for Plaintiff Doe.  \nA15-16.    Boys  and  girls  on  Kyrene  Middle  School’s  cross-country  team  train \ntogether, but boys and girls compete separately.  A15.

Movants  sought  a  stay  or,  in  the  alternative,  an \nadministrative stay of the preliminary injunction for seven days to allow time for the \nNinth Circuit to consider an emergency motion to stay and request for administrative \nstay.

Under the Act, “Athletic teams or sports designated for ‘females,’ \n‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.”  A.R.S. § 15-\n120.02(B); A46.  The Act applies to higher education institutions, public schools, \nand any private school that competes against a public school.  Id. at § 15-120.02(A), \n(I); A46-47. \nEvidence in the district court supported the Act by conclusively showing that \nbiological males are stronger, run faster, jump higher, throw harder, and kick farther \nthan biological females.  These physiological differences exist before, during, and \nafter puberty, and they continue to exist even with puberty blockers or testosterone \nsuppression.  Biological females are at a competitive disadvantage and an increased \nrisk of injury when competing against biological males.  The Act thus is substantially \nrelated to the “legitimate and important” government interest of “redressing past \ndiscrimination  against  women  in  athletics  and  promoting  equality  of  athletic \nopportunity  between  the  sexes.”    Clark,  By  &  Through  Clark  v.  Arizona \nInterscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1982) (“Clark I”). \nMovants are likely to prevail on appeal because the district court misapplied \nintermediate scrutiny by not assessing the validity of the classification that Plaintiffs \nchallenge as a whole and instead requiring perfect tailoring as to these Plaintiffs.  \n1 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 12 of 33\nEven if tailoring were required, the district court clearly erred by finding against the \noverwhelming  weight  of  evidence  that  there  is  no  competitive  advantage  for \nbiological boys over girls pre-puberty.  And the Act does not violate Title IX because \nthat law authorizes separation of sports teams based on biological sex. \nIssuing a stay will impose no cognizable harm on Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs would \nhave an unfair competitive advantage if they played on girls’ teams.  Their exclusion \nfrom girls’ teams is due to a medical condition, not the States’ sex-based separation \nof sports teams.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ long delay before seeking judicial relief \nstrongly undercuts their claim of irreparable injury. \nIn contrast, the injunction irreparably harms the State and interested parties.  \nThe district court erred by overlooking the injuries to displaced biological girls.  Any \nsuccess by Plaintiffs in try-outs and meets will displace biological girls from making \na team, getting playing time, and succeeding in final results.  The court also gave no \nweight to the irreparable injury to the State of Arizona in enforcing its valid statutes. \nFinally, the public interest strongly favors a stay.  The public has an interest \nin upholding the law passed by their elected officials.  Girls also have an interest in \nnot competing against, being injured by, or being displaced by biological boys. \nThis Court should enter a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 13 of 33\nARGUMENT \nThis Court considers four factors when considering whether to grant a stay \npending appeal: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the \nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009).  These factors favor Movants here. \nMoreover, as the district court acknowledged, a mandatory injunction that \nchanges the status quo “requires a heightened burden of proof and is particularly \ndisfavored.”  A32 (citing Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. Mucos Pharma GmbH & \nCo., 571 F.3d 873, 879 (9th Cir. 2009)).  The district court held that its injunction is \nprohibitory, not mandatory, A32-33, but this holding is incorrect.  The Act went into \neffect on September 24, 2022, A10, and neither Plaintiff brought a challenge at that \ntime.  Instead, both Plaintiffs complied with the Act for many months, encompassing \nmultiple sports seasons, before challenging it.  See A20.  The “status quo” is that the \nAct was continuously in effect before the injunction, and the injunction is thus a \n“particularly disfavored” mandatory injunction that required a “heightened burden \nof proof,” which the district court did not apply.  A32. \nI.  Movants Are Likely to Prevail on Appeal. \nMovants are likely to succeed on the merits for at least four reasons. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 14 of 33\nA.  The district court misapplied intermediate scrutiny. \nThe  district  court’s  formulation  and  application  of  intermediate  scrutiny \ncontradicts precedent from the Supreme Court.  The Act provides that sports teams \nshall be designated “based on the biological sex of the students who participate on \nthe team or in the sport,” and that “[a]thletic teams or sports designated for ‘females,’ \n‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.”  A.R.S. § 15-120-\n02; A46.  As the district court noted, the Act classifies by biological sex for student-\nathletes of all ages: “The Act applies equally to kindergarten through college teams \n. . . .”  A21.1  The district court did not dispute that the Act advances the State’s \ninterests in fairness, equality of opportunity, and safety for female student-athletes \nat least at the older age ranges; the district court stated, “the problems identified as \nbeing addressed by the act—opportunity and safety—are limited to high school and \ncollege sports.”  Id.  In addition, the district court found biological males who have \ngone through male puberty do have a significant competitive advantage in sports.  \nSee A24.  Thus, the exclusion of such athletes from girls’ and women’s teams \nsignificantly  advances  the  Act’s  interests  of  fairness,  safety,  and  equality  of \nopportunity for biologically female athletes. \n \n1 The district court criticized the Act’s application to kindergartners as an example \nof “overbreadth.”  A4.  But “the existence of wiser alternatives than the one chosen \ndoes not serve to invalidate the policy [of excluding boys from girls’ sports] since it \nis substantially related to the goal.”  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1132. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 15 of 33\nNevertheless,  the  district  court  concluded  that  this  substantial  body  of \nundisputed  evidence  establishing  the  competitive  advantage  of  biological  male \nathletes who transition after going through puberty is “not relevant to the question \nbefore the Court: whether transgender girls like Plaintiffs, who have not experienced \nmale puberty, have performance advantages that place other girls at a competitive \ndisadvantage or at risk of injury.”  A24 (emphasis added).  The district court thus \ndisregarded the extensive, highly probative evidence of competitive advantages for \ntransgender-female athletes who transition after undergoing male puberty, simply \nbecause the two individual Plaintiffs in this case claim that they did not or will not \nundergo male puberty.  Id.  As the district court stated, evidence of male competitive \nadvantage after puberty “is not relevant because the Plaintiffs have not and never \nwill experience male puberty.”  A25. \nThis is error.  Under intermediate scrutiny, which the district court applied, \nthe  validity  of  the  classification  that  Plaintiffs  challenge  must  be  assessed  by \nconsidering  the  classification  as  a  whole,  not  by  considering  only  the  narrow \napplication  of  that  classification  to  the  individual  Plaintiffs  in  their  unique \ncircumstances.  By reasoning otherwise, the district court effectively applied strict \nscrutiny by requiring perfect tailoring as to these Plaintiffs—which is not required. \nThe Supreme Court’s precedent makes this clear.  Under intermediate scrutiny, \nthe question whether the Act advances the government’s asserted interests “cannot \n5 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 16 of 33\nbe answered by limiting the inquiry to whether the governmental interest is directly \nadvanced as applied to a single person or entity.  Even if there were no advancement \nas applied in that manner . . . there would remain the matter of the regulation’s \ngeneral application to others . . . .”  United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. \n418, 427 (1993) (emphasis added).  Thus, by focusing solely on whether the Act \nadvances its fairness, safety, and opportunity interests solely when it applies to \nPlaintiffs—to  the  point  of  treating  extensive  evidence  of  the Act’s  success  in \nadvancing its interests as to others as “not relevant,” A24—the district court “thus \nasked the wrong question.”  Edge Broadcasting, 509 U.S. at 472. \nEven if the Act did not substantially advance the State’s interests by excluding \nthese specific Plaintiffs from girls’ teams (which, in fact, it does, see infra), “that \nfact is beside the point, for the validity of the regulation depends on the relation it \nbears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct, not on the extent to \nwhich it furthers the government’s interests in an individual case.”  Ward v. Rock \nAgainst Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 801 (1989).  “Here, the regulation’s effectiveness \nmust be judged by considering all the varied groups” that it affects—including \nbiological males who transition post-puberty—“and it is valid so long as [Arizona] \ncould reasonably have determined that its interests overall would be served less \neffectively without the . . . guideline than with it.”  Id.  “Considering [the State’s] \nproffered justifications together,” under intermediate scrutiny the Act is valid if it \n6 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 17 of 33\n“directly furthers the [State’s] legitimate government interests and . . . those interests \nwould have been less well served in the absence of the . . . guideline.”  Id.  \nIndeed, this requirement of considering the Act as a whole under intermediate \nscrutiny—instead of requiring the State to provide a case-specific justification for \neach individual excluded—is inherent in the very concept of intermediate scrutiny.  \nIntermediate scrutiny for sex-based classifications does not require perfect tailoring.  \nOn the contrary, to justify a sex-based classification, the State need only show an \nimportant  governmental  interest  and  a  “substantial  relationship”  between  the \nclassification and that interest: “The State must show at least that the challenged \nclassification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”  \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (cleaned up); see also, e.g., \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982).  As a West Virginia \ndistrict  court  concisely  observed  in  addressing  a  similar  case:  “Sex-based \nclassifications  fall  under  intermediate  scrutiny  and  therefore  do  not  have  a \n‘narrowly-tailored’ requirement.”  B. P. J. v. W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ., No. 2:21-\nCV-00316, 2023 WL 111875, at *8 (S.D. W. Va. Jan. 5, 2023). \nBy  considering  only  the Act  as  applied  to  the  individual  Plaintiffs,  and \ndisregarding how the Act serves its purposes when applied to transgender-female \nathletes who transition after undergoing male puberty, the district court incorrectly \n7 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 18 of 33\nconflated the nature of Plaintiffs’ challenge with the substantive standard governing \nthe Act’s validity.  As the Supreme Court has held, “classifying a lawsuit as facial or \nas-applied affects the extent to which the invalidity of the challenged law must be \ndemonstrated and the corresponding breadth of the remedy, but it does not speak at \nall to the substantive rule of law necessary to establish a constitutional violation.”  \nBucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1127 (2019) (emphasis added). \nWhen the correct “substantive rule of law” is applied, id., the Act substantially \nadvances its important government interests in fairness, safety, and equality of \nopportunity for female athletes.  The district court agreed that these are important \ngovernment interests, A36; see also Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131, and the district court’s \nown  findings  demonstrate  that  transgender-female  athletes  who  transition  after \nundergoing  male puberty  have  a significant  athletic advantage over  biological-\nfemale athletes.  See, e.g., A25.  For example, the district court noted “specific male \nphysiological advantages” that “are a result of testosterone levels in men post-\npuberty,” and did not dispute that “such advantages are not reversed by testosterone \nsuppression after puberty or are reduced only modestly, leaving a large advantage \nover  female  athletes.”    A25.    These  facts  alone  demonstrate  that  the  Act  is \n“substantially related” to the interests it advances.  Virginia, 458 U.S. at 724.  \nB.  The district court’s finding that biological males who do not \nundergo male puberty have no competitive advantage over female \nathletes is clearly erroneous. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 19 of 33\nEven if the State were required to provide a case-specific justification for its \nexclusion of these particular Plaintiffs instead of justifying the Act as a whole—\nwhich it is not—the injunction is still unlikely to be upheld on appeal.  The district \ncourt’s key factual findings used to undermine the Act’s justification—i.e., that there \nis no competitive advantage for biological boys over girls pre-puberty, and thus no \ncompetitive advantage for transgender-female athletes who suppress male puberty—\nare clearly erroneous.  All the competent evidence in the record points in the opposite \ndirection.  There is a competitive advantage for boys over girls in sports before \npuberty, and there is not a scintilla of evidence that puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy eliminate this advantage. \nAs for the competitive advantage for biological boys before puberty, the \ndistrict court itself acknowledged some of this evidence:  \n50% of 6-year-old boys completed more laps in the 20-meter shuttle \n(14) than girls (12). (Brown Decl. (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶ 84.) Other fitness \ndata reflects differences between 9 through 17-year-old boys and girls, \nwith 9-year-old boys always exceeding girls’ running times by various \npercentages ranging from 11.1-15.2%, id. ¶ 89; arm hang fitness scores \n(7.48 boys, 5.14 girls), id. ¶ 92; standing broad jump (128.3 boys, 118.0 \ngirls), id. ¶ 99. (See also Brown Decl. (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶106 (quoting \nThomas 1985 study at 266) (“Boys exceed girls in throwing velocity by \n1.5 standard deviation units as early as 4 to 7 years of age . . .” and \nthrowing distance by 1.5 standard deviation units as early as 2 to 4 years \nof age).) \n \nA25-26.  And there is much more.  The evidence of male competitive advantage pre-\npuberty is overwhelming and effectively uncontradicted.  Declaration of Dr. Gregory \n9 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 20 of 33\nA.  Brown  (“Brown  Decl.”), A85-102,  ¶¶  77-115;  Rebuttal  Declaration  of  Dr. \nGregory A. Brown (“Brown Rebuttal Decl.”), A171-81, ¶¶ 6-15, 20, 23, 25, 31-32; \nDeclaration  of  Dr.  Emma  Hilton  (“Hilton  Decl.”),  A299-308,  ¶¶  7.1-7.22; \nDeclaration of Dr. Linda Blade, A354-59. \nPlaintiffs’ experts contend, and the district court held, that this overwhelming \nevidence of pre-puberty male competitive advantage should be discounted entirely \nbecause  it  supposedly  arises  from  “other  factors  such  as  greater  societal \nencouragement of athleticism in boys, greater opportunities for boys to play sports, \nor differences in the preferences of the boys and girls surveyed.”  A27 (emphasis \nadded).  Notably, by stating “or,” the district court declined to specify which of these \nthree “other factors” (or combination thereof) supposedly causes the observed pre-\npubescent male advantages—i.e., the district court held that some other factor(s) \nmust cause the competitive advantages, but did not determine what they are.  This is \nspeculation, not evidence.  And indeed, Plaintiffs’ expert offered only speculation \nand conjecture—not hard evidence—for his conclusion that other “social” factors \ncause this discrepancy.  See Second Rebuttal Declaration of Dr. Daniel Shumer, \nA373-74, A381, ¶¶ 21, 24, 46.  Based on the record evidence before the district court, \ntherefore, the only credible conclusion is that biological males have a significant \n10 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 21 of 33\ncompetitive advantage pre-puberty.  The district court’s conclusion to the contrary \ncontradicts the overwhelming weight of the evidence and common sense.2 \nLikewise, no evidence supports the Plaintiffs’ contention that puberty blockers \nand  hormone  treatment  eliminate  the  competitive  advantage  enjoyed  by  pre-\npubescent  males.    Brown  Decl., A102-105,  ¶¶ 116-125;  Brown  Rebuttal  Decl., \nA181, ¶ 33; Hilton Decl., A315, ¶¶ 11.1-11.4. \nC.  The Act easily satisfies rational-basis review. \nThe Act is subject to rational-basis review because Plaintiffs do not challenge \nthe classification based on sex, but rather how Arizona defines sex.  See, e.g., Jana-\nRock Constr., Inc. v. New York Dep’t of Econ. Dev., 438 F.3d 195, 212-14 (2d Cir. \n2006); Hoohuli v. Ariyoshi, 631 F. Supp. 1153 (D. Haw. 1986).  Unlike the facial \ndiscrimination in Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2019), the Act does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of transgender status because all biological boys, whether \n \n2 The three studies cited by the district court all found that in children younger than \nPlaintiffs, boys had competitive advantages over girls.  Handelsman reported that \nboys had a pre-pubertal advantage over girls in swimming, running, and jumping.  \nBrown Rebuttal Dec., A174-75, ¶ 20 (“This figure demonstrates an average male \nperformance advantage of ~3% in running at age 10, ~4% at age 11, and ~5% at age \n12, and this figure also demonstrates an ~6% male advantage in jumping at age 10, \nand ~5% at ages 11 and 12.”).  Senefeld reported that the top 100 boy swimmers had \ngreater swim velocity than the top 100 girl swimmers beginning around age 8 \n(Figure 1), and “beginning at age 10, boys had faster swimming performance than \ngirls.”  A222, A224.  And McKay’s data showed males were stronger in 11 of 12 \ntests from ages 3-9 years (Table 1), and that from 10 years of age “males are \nsignificantly stronger in all measures.”  A253, A255. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 22 of 33\nthey identify as boys or as girls, are excluded from girls’ sports.  Since the Clark I \nand II decisions in the 1980s, boys in Arizona have attempted to play in girls’ sports. \nThe district court’s alternative holding that the Act fails rational-basis review, \nA38-39, is unlikely to be upheld.  The Act satisfies rational-basis scrutiny “if there \nis any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the \nclassification.”  F.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993).  Here, \nthere is not just a “conceivable” justification, but an overwhelming one based on \nextensive scientific evidence, discussed above.  See supra. \nThe district court nevertheless held that the Act fails rational-basis scrutiny \nbecause it reflects a “bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.”  A38-\n39 (quoting U. S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973)).  This \nconclusion is insupportable.  No competent evidence supports it, and the district \ncourt cited none.  As Moreno makes clear, this conclusion applies only when “[t]he \nchallenged statutory classification … is clearly irrelevant to the stated purposes of \nthe Act.”  Id.  Here, the separation of sports based on biological sex is not “clearly \nirrelevant to the stated purposed of the Act,” id., as the Ninth Circuit’s case law \ndemonstrates.  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131.  Separating sports teams by biological sex \n“simply  recogniz[es]  the  physiological  fact  that  males  would  have  an  undue \nadvantage competing against women,” and “there is clearly a substantial relationship \nbetween the exclusion of males from the team and the goal of redressing past \n12 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 23 of 33\ndiscrimination and providing equal opportunities for women.”  Id.  Furthermore, \nbecause the Act does not involve a traditionally suspect class, Plaintiffs’ animus \nclaim cannot succeed if the Act serves a legitimate government interest, which the \nAct does.  Boardman v. Inslee, 978 F.3d 1092, 1119 (9th Cir. 2020); Animal Legal \nDef. Fund v. Wasden, 878 F.3d 1184, 1201 (9th Cir. 2018). \nD.  The Act does not violate Title IX. \nThe district court’s brief discussion of Title IX, A39-40, is unlikely to be \nupheld on appeal.  The Act is valid under Title IX for many of the same reasons that \nit is valid under the Equal Protection Clause. \nThe district court ignored and did not cite evidence that Title IX, from its \ninception, was understood to specifically authorize the separation of sports teams \nbased on biological sex—exactly what the Act does.  Title IX’s contemporaneous \nimplementing regulation, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b) (entitled “Separate teams”)—which \nthe  district  court  did  not  acknowledge  or  cite—makes  this  point  very  clear: \n“Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may \noperate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such \nteams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.”  Id.  \n“Title IX permits sex-separate athletic teams ‘where selection for such teams is based \nupon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.’”  B.P.J., 2023 WL \n111875, at *9 (quoting 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b)).  “[I]t would require blinders to ignore \n13 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 24 of 33\nthat  the  motivation  for  the  promulgation  of  the  regulation  was  to  increase \nopportunities for women and girls in athletics.”  Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, \nPa., 998 F.2d 168, 175 (3d Cir. 1993).  The Act, “which largely mirrors Title IX,” \ndoes not violate Title IX.  B.P.J., 2023 WL 111875, at *10. \nIn holding to the contrary, the district court relied heavily on Grabowski v. \nArizona Board of Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116 (9th Cir. 2023), and its discussion of \nBostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1746-47 (2020).  A39-40.  This was \nerror.  Bostock explicitly recognized that “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” \n(including transgender status) are distinct concepts.  Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1746-47.  \nPervasive harassment based on perceived sexual orientation violates Title IX under \nGrabowski, see 2023 WL 3961123, at *2, just as employment discrimination based \non sexual orientation may violate Title VI under Bostock, but neither Bostock nor \nGrabowski  addressed  whether  separating  sports  teams  based  on  biological  sex \nviolates Title IX.  See id.  Title IX and its implementing regulations provide that \nsports teams separated by biological sex are permissible, see 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), \nand binding Ninth Circuit precedent holds the same.  Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1127.  \nNothing in Grabowski purports to overrule Clark I or II—nor could it.  The district \ncourt’s  only  response  is  that  legislation  like Arizona’s  is  “currently  subject  to \ndebate.”  A5. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 25 of 33\nII.  Issuing a Stay Will Impose No Cognizable Harm on Plaintiffs. \nBecause the Act is valid, it imposes no cognizable harm on Plaintiffs.  As \ndiscussed above, as biological males, Plaintiffs would have an unfair competitive \nadvantage if they played on girls’ teams and forced biological girls to compete \nagainst them.  Being required to compete on an even biological footing is not a \ncognizable  harm,  while  forcing girls  to  compete  on  an uneven  footing against \nbiological boys is a cognizable harm—which the district court ignored.  See infra. \nTo be sure, as the district court held, Plaintiffs contend that they have a \nmedical condition—gender dysphoria—that prevents them from competing on boys’ \nsports teams.  See A30-32.  But it is not uncommon for biological males to have \nmedical conditions that prevent them from participating on male sports teams, and \nthose  males  suffer  the  same  injury  of  being  unable  to  participate  in  sports.  \nUltimately, that exclusion is due to their medical condition, not due to the States’ \nsex-based separation of sports teams.   \nLikewise,  Plaintiffs’  assertions  of  dignitary  harms,  “shame,”  and \n“humiliation,” A41, fail to identify cognizable injuries.  Requiring Plaintiffs to \nparticipate on a competitively even footing presents no objective affront to their \ndignity and provides no objective basis to experience shame or humiliation.  And \nmerely  subjective  feelings  of  anger,  shame,  or  embarrassment  as  a  result  of  a \ngovernment policy, however sincerely felt, do not constitute cognizable irreparable \n15 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 26 of 33\nharm—otherwise,  every  government  policy  would  be  subject  to  an  “emotional \nheckler’s veto.”  See, e.g., Mungia v. Judson Indep. Sch. Dist., No. CIV.A SA-09-\nCV-395-X, 2009 WL 3431397, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 19, 2009) (“[Plaintiff] has not \nprovided, nor can this Court locate, any authority in which a Court found irreparable \nharm  based  on  ‘humiliation’  or  ‘embarrassment.’”);  Sharon  City  Sch.  Dist.  v. \nPennsylvania  Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n,  Inc.,  No.  CIV.A.  9-213,  2009 WL \n427373,  at  *2  (W.D.  Pa.  Feb.  20,  2009)  (no  irreparable  harm  based  on \n“embarrassment  and  humiliation”);  United  Steelworkers  Of  Am.  Loc.  13792  v. \nMikocem Corp. Cemeteries, No. 05-73184, 2005 WL 2090884, at *4 (E.D. Mich. \nAug. 30, 2005) (no irreparable harm based on “stigmatization and humiliation”). \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ long delay before seeking judicial relief strongly undercuts \ntheir claim of irreparable injury.  As the district court held, Plaintiffs delayed through \nthree sports seasons—almost a year—before challenging the Act.  Plaintiff Roe \nparticipated in sports in accordance with the Act for many months before challenging \nthe Act.  A20.  This significant delay strongly undercuts the urgency of Plaintiffs’ \nasserted injuries.  See, e.g., Oakland Trib., Inc. v. Chron. Pub. Co., 762 F.2d 1374, \n1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Plaintiff’s long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction \nimplies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.”); see also Charlesbank Equity Fund \nII v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 163 (1st Cir. 2004); Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, \n16 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 27 of 33\nInc., 237 F.3d 891, 903 (7th Cir. 2001); Young v. Motion Picture Ass’n of Am., Inc., \n299 F.2d 119, 121 (D.C. Cir. 1962). \nIII.  The Injunction Imposes Irreparable Harm on Other Parties \nInterested in the Proceeding and on the State.  \n \nThe district court emphasized the injury to Plaintiffs from exclusion in sports, \nbut it disregarded the greater injury to the biological girls unfairly displaced by \nPlaintiffs’ participation in girls’ sports.  A40-42.  In the district court’s discussion of \nthe  last  three  equitable  factors,  this  critical  issue  was  never  mentioned.    Id.  \nOverlooking the commensurate injuries to the displaced biological girls is error.  \nThe district court’s finding of irreparable injury to Plaintiffs rested heavily on \nthe  district  court’s  findings  of  social,  emotional,  and  physical  benefits  from \nparticipation in sports:  \nSchool  sports  offer  social,  emotional,  physical,  and  mental  health \nbenefits.  The social benefits of school sports include the opportunity to \nmake friends and become part of a supportive community of teammates \nand peers.  School sports provide an opportunity for youth to gain \nconfidence and reduce the effects of risk factors that lead to increases \nin depression.  Students who play school sports have fewer physical and \nmental health concerns than those that do not.  Students who participate \nin high school sports are more likely to finish college and participation \nin high school sports has a positive impact on academic achievement. \n \nA23  (citations  and  paragraph  divisions  omitted).    Needless  to  say,  these  same \nbenefits of participating in competitive sports—“social, emotional, physical, and \nmental health benefits,” id.—are just as applicable to biological girls as transgender \ngirls.  See Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1131. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 28 of 33\nHere,  the  district  court’s  own  findings  demonstrated  that  Plaintiffs’ \nparticipation in sports threatens to displace biological girls from limited places on \nsports teams and competitions.  The teams on which Doe and Roe wish to compete \nhave competitive try-outs and competitive meets.  A15 (Doe “intends to … try out \nfor the girls’ soccer and basketball teams”); A16 (“the first cross-country competitive \nmeet will occur the week of August 14, 2023”); A17 (Roe “intends to try out for the \ngirls’ volleyball team”).  This means that Doe and Roe, to the extent that they \nsucceed in try-outs and meets, ipso facto will displace biological girls.  In every \ncompetitive try-out, a Plaintiff making the team displaces a biological girl who \notherwise would have made the team.  In every volleyball and basketball game, a \nPlaintiff getting coveted playing time displaces a biological girl who must sit on the \nbench.  Cross-country meets are scored by ordering all runners who participate from \nfirst to last.  That means that a transgender runner displaces every biological girl who \nfinishes after the transgender runner by at least one place.  Competitive sports are \nzero-sum by their very nature.  The district court’s analysis ignored the injuries to \nthe biological girls unfairly displaced by biological boys, and it thus relegates them \nto the status of anonymous, voiceless victims. \nThe district court held that there will not be much impact on Arizona girls \nbecause  there  are  relatively  few  transgender  athletes  in Arizona,  reasoning  as \nfollows: “Less than one percent of the population is transgender, with male and \n18 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 29 of 33\nfemale transgender people being roughly the same in number. . . .  It appears \nuntenable that allowing transgender women to compete on women’s teams would \nsubstantially displace female athletes.”  A19 (quoting Hecox v. Little, 479 F. Supp. \n3d 930, 977-78 (D. Idaho 2020)).  This holding contradicts the Ninth Circuit’s \nreasoning in Clark II, which emphasized the displacement injury that occurs “even \nto the extent of one player.”  Clark By & Through Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic \nAss’n, 886 F.2d 1191, 1193 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Clark II”).  “If males are permitted to \ndisplace females on the school volleyball team even to the extent of one player like \nClark, the goal of equal participation by females in interscholastic athletics is set \nback, not advanced.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nThe district court also erred by giving no weight to the irreparable injury to \nthe sovereign interest of the State of Arizona when it cannot enforce its valid statutes.  \n“[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by \nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.” Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (internal quotation \nomitted); see also Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 718, 719 (9th \nCir. 1997) (“[I]t is clear that a state suffers irreparable injury whenever an enactment \nof its people or their representatives is enjoined”); L. W. by & through Williams v. \nSkrmetti, No. 23-5600, 2023 WL 4410576, at *8 (6th Cir. July 8, 2023). \n19 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 30 of 33\nIV.  The Public Interest Strongly Favors a Stay. \nThe final factor—public interest—“merge[s]” with the injury to the State and \nits citizens.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  As noted, the district court \nheld that there are relatively few transgender athletes who have sought access to \ngirls’ and women’s teams in Arizona so far, and thus it concludes that the injunction \nwill have little impact on the public interest.  A19.  This is error.  Nken held that \n“courts must be mindful that the Government’s role as the respondent in every \nremoval  proceeding  does  not  make  the  public  interest  in  each  individual  one \nnegligible, as some courts have concluded.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  The fact that \nsuch proceedings apply to a single person does not undermine the strong public \ninterest in upholding the law.  Permitting a single transgender-female athlete to \nparticipate on girls’ teams “permits and prolongs a continuing violation of … law.”  \nId. (square brackets omitted).   The Act, as a duly enacted law adopted by Arizona’s \nelected representatives, is itself a clear and authoritative declaration of the public \ninterest in Arizona.  See, e.g., Virginian Ry. Co. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, \n552 (1937) (holding that a policy enacted in a statute “is in itself a declaration of \npublic interest and policy which should be persuasive in inducing courts to give \nrelief”).  The district court erred by disregarding these public interests. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should stay the district court’s injunction pending appeal.   \n20 \n \n\nCase: 23-16026, 08/01/2023, ID: 12766063, DktEntry: 7-1, Page 31 of 33\nDated: August 1, 2023    Respectfully Submitted, \n \n          James Otis Law Group, LLC \n \n          /s/ D.

Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 16(b) \n22  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,  \n23  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n24  1.  The  parties  shall  exchange  initial  disclosures  on  or  before \n25  September 29, 2023. \n26  2.  Intervenor Legislator Defendants shall file their answer or other responsive \n27  motion by September 12, 2023. \n28   \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 144   Filed 08/28/23   Page 2 of 5\n \n \n \n1  3.  The parties’ deadline for filing motions to amend pleadings and motions to \n2  join additional parties shall be October 23, 2023.   \n3  4.  Plaintiff shall disclose all expert witnesses, exhibits and other Rule 26(a)(2) \n4  matters on or before March 1, 2024. Defendant shall disclose all expert witnesses, exhibits \n5  and other Rule 26(a)(2) matters on or before April 1, 2024. All rebuttal expert opinions \n6  shall be disclosed on or before May 15, 2024.   \n7  5.  The parties shall disclose all lay witnesses pursuant to Rule 26(a)(3)(i), Fed. \n8  R. Civ.

In the event of a dispute over discovery matters, counsel are cautioned to first \n19  engage in personal consultation regarding the dispute and to make a sincere effort to \n20  resolve the conflict. See LRCiv 7.2(j). Counsel should act to resolve discovery disputes \n21  quickly. If such efforts fail, counsel should then jointly call the Judge’s law clerk to arrange \n22  a schedule for resolving the dispute expeditiously. \n23  8.  Dispositive motions shall be filed on or before August 16, 2024.

With respect to filing motions for \n5  summary judgment, the parties are directed to LRCiv 56.1. The parties are advised to pay \n6  particular attention to LRCiv 56.1(b), which states:  \n7  Any party opposing a motion for summary judgment must file \na statement, separate from that party’s memorandum of law, \n8  setting forth: (1) for each paragraph of the moving party’s \nseparate  statement  of  facts,  a  correspondingly  numbered \n9  paragraph indicating whether the party disputes the statement \nof fact set forth in that paragraph and a reference to the specific \n10  admissible portion of the record supporting the party’s position \nif the fact is disputed; and (2) any additional facts that establish \n11  a genuine issue of material fact or otherwise preclude judgment \nin favor of the moving party. Each additional fact must be set \n12  forth in a separately numbered paragraph and must refer to a \nspecific admissible portion of the record where the fact finds \n13  support. No reply statement of facts may be filed. \n14 \nThe opposing party’s separate statement must include both the controverting and additional \n15 \nfacts  in  consecutively  numbered  paragraphs,  starting  with  the  numbered  paragraphs \n16 \ncorresponding to the moving party’s separate statement of facts. In addition, filings with \n17 \nmore than one exhibit shall be tabbed and divided and include a table of contents.  \n18 \n10.  Five days prior to any oral argument, hearing, or trial, counsel shall provide \n19 \na Notice to Court Reporter to facilitate the creation of an accurate record.

Counsel shall file a Joint Proposed Pretrial Order and any Daubert motions \n5  within thirty (30) days after resolution of the dispositive motions filed after the end of \n6  discovery. If no such motions are filed, a Joint Proposed Pretrial Order will be due on or \n7  before September 16, 2024.  The content of the proposed pretrial order shall include, but \n8  not be limited to, that prescribed in the Form of Pretrial Order found on the Courts’ website, \n9  under the tabs: Judges Information/Judges Orders, Forms and Procedures for Judge Zipps: \n10  https://perma.cc/SK55-JKK4. \n11  12.  Counsel  shall  file  a  brief  Joint  Settlement  Status  Report  on  or  before \n12  January 22, 2024, and every ninety (90) days thereafter.

All motions for an award of attorneys’ fees shall be accompanied by an \n16  electronic spreadsheet, to be e-mailed to the Court and opposing counsel, containing an \n17  itemized statement of legal services with all information required by Local Rule 54.2(e)(1). \n18  This spreadsheet shall be organized with rows and columns and shall automatically total \n19  the amount of fees requested so as to enable the Court to efficiently review and recompute, \n20  if needed, the total amount of any award after disallowing any individual billing entries. \n21  This spreadsheet does not relieve the moving party of its burden under Local Rule 54.2(d) \n22  to  attach  all  necessary  supporting  documentation  to  its  memorandum  of  points  and \n23  authorities filed in support of its motion. A party opposing a motion for attorneys’ fees \n24  shall e-mail the Court and opposing counsel a copy of the moving party’s spreadsheet \n25  adding any objections to each contested billing entry (next to each row, in an additional \n26  column) so as to enable the Court to efficiently review the objections and recompute the \n27  total amount of any award after disallowing any individual billing entries.

(Id.)  \n21    Plaintiffs  plead  only  Title  IX,  ADA,  and  Rehabilitation  Act  claims  against \n22  Defendant The Gregory School (TGS), a private school organized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit \n23  and attended by one of the Plaintiffs. (Doc. 1.) Now pending before the Court is TGS’s \n24  partial Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 37.) TGS argues that Plaintiffs fail to state \n25  a claim against TGS under Title IX and the Rehabilitation Act because these statutes apply \n26  only to private entities that receive “federal financial assistance.” (Doc. 37 at 2.) TGS \n27  argues that Plaintiffs fail to state an ADA claim because Section 12132 of the ADA applies \n28  only to public entities, not private ones. (Id.) The Motion is fully briefed. (See Docs. 37, \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 2 of 9\n \n \n \n1  64, 77.) For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in \n2  part. \n3  I.  LEGAL STANDARD \n4  A 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of a claim. Conservation \n5  Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d 1240, 1241-42 (9th Cir. 2011). Claim dismissal is proper where \n6  there is no cognizable legal theory or there are insufficient facts to support a cognizable \n7  legal theory. Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n8  II.  REHABILITATION ACT AND TITLE IX CLAIMS \n9    Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title IX prohibit certain conduct by \n10  entities that receive federal financial assistance. See 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (Title IX applies \n11  to “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance”); 29 U.S.C. § \n12  794(a) (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applies to “any program or activity receiving \n13  Federal financial assistance”). TGS does not receive monetary grants or property from the \n14  federal government. Plaintiffs contend that TGS is subject to liability under Section 504 \n15  and Title IX because the school is recognized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. \n16  There is no controlling authority on point, and the courts that have addressed this issue \n17  have reached contrary conclusions.  \n18    Plaintiffs cite E.H. by & through Herrera v. Valley Christian Academy, 616 F. Supp. \n19  3d 1040, 1050 (C.D. Cal. 2022), Buettner-Hartsoe v. Baltimore Lutheran High School \n20  Ass'n,  No.  CV  RDB-20-3132,  2022  WL  2869041,  at  *3  (D.  Md.  July  21,  2022), \n21  reconsideration denied, motion to certify appeal granted, No. CV RDB-20-3132, 2022 WL \n22  4080294 (D. Md. Sept. 6, 2022), Fulani v. League of Women Voters Education Fund, 684 \n23  F. Supp. 1185, 1192 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd, 882 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1989), and McGlotten \n24  v. Connally, 338 F. Supp. 448, 461 (D.D.C. 1972), for the proposition that an organization’s \n25  § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt designation constitutes the receipt of federal financial assistance. \n26  (Doc. 64 at 9-11.) TGS cites Johnny's Icehouse, Inc. v. Amateur Hockey Ass'n Illinois, Inc., \n27  134 F. Supp. 2d 965, 972 (N.D. Ill. 2001), to support its position that non-profit tax-exempt \n28  status is not the equivalent of federal financial assistance. (Doc. 37 at 6.) TGS also relies \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 3 of 9\n \n \n \n1  on the reasoning of certain decisions of the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit Court of \n2  Appeals addressing the receipt of financial assistance. (Doc. 77 at 4.)  Both parties argue \n3  the  applicability  of  Department  of  Education  regulations  defining  federal  financial \n4  assistance.  The Court begins its analysis with these regulations.  \n5  Although  neither  Title  IX  nor  the  Rehabilitation  Act  define  federal  financial \n6  assistance, Department of Education regulations define “federal financial assistance” for \n7  purposes of Title IX as follows:  \n \n8 \nFederal financial assistance means any of the following, when authorized \n9  or extended under a law administered by the Department: \n \n10 \n(1) A grant or loan of Federal financial assistance, including funds made \n11  available for: \n \n12 \n(i) The acquisition, construction, renovation, restoration, or repair of \n13  a building or facility or any portion thereof; and \n \n14 \n(ii) Scholarships, loans, grants, wages or other funds extended to any \n15  entity for payment to or on behalf of students admitted to that entity, \nor extended directly to such students for payment to that entity. \n16 \n \n(2) A grant of Federal real or personal property or any interest therein, \n17 \nincluding surplus property, and the proceeds of the sale or transfer of such \n18  property, if the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not, \nupon such sale or transfer, properly accounted for to the Federal Government. \n19 \n \n20  (3) Provision of the services of Federal personnel. \n \n21 \n(4) Sale or lease of Federal  property or any interest therein at nominal \n22  consideration, or at consideration reduced for the purpose of assisting the \nrecipient  or  in  recognition  of  public  interest  to  be  served  thereby,  or \n23 \npermission  to  use  Federal  property  or  any  interest  therein  without \n24  consideration. \n \n25 \n(5) Any other contract, agreement, or arrangement which has as one of its \n26  purposes the provision of assistance to any education program or activity, \nexcept a contract of insurance or guaranty. \n27 \n34 C.F.R. § 106.2(g) (emphasis in original). “Tax-exempt status” is not listed as a form of \n28 \nfederal financial assistance in the Department of Education’s definition and tax-exempt \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 4 of 9\n \n \n \n1  status  is  not  assistance  “authorized  or  extended  under  a  law  administered  by  the \n2  Department,” as the introductory phrase of the regulatory definition requires. Id.   \n3   Plaintiffs assert that the § 106.2(g)(5) “catchall” provision is so broad as to include \n4  tax exempt status. Plaintiffs argue that tax exempt status is a “subsidy” that constitutes an \n5  “arrangement” which has as one of its purposes the provision of assistance to an education \n6  program. (Doc. 64 at 10.) Section 106(g)(5) is broad indeed; however, a catchall provision \n7  must be read as, “bringing within a statute categories similar in type to those specifically \n8  enumerated within the statute.” Paroline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 447 (2014). None \n9  of the categories of “financial assistance” described in subparts (1)-(5) of the regulation are \n10  similar to 501(c)(3) status. Rather, the enumerated categories consist of affirmative grants \n11  of federal resources, such as federal funds, federal property, and federal personnel.1 In \n12  contrast, tax-exempt status is a designation provided by the Internal Revenue Service to \n13  certain organizations, typically nonprofit entities, that meet specific criteria outlined in the \n14  tax code. 26 U.S.C. §§ 170, 501(c)(3). This status exempts the designated entity from \n15  federal income taxes for most types of revenue. Id. at § 501(a). In addition, many donations \n16  to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax deductible by the donor. See Charitable Contribution \n17  Deductions,  INTERNAL  REVENUE  SERVICE,  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-\n18  profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions (June 5, 2023).  Tax \n19  exempt status is distinguishable from an affirmative grant of federal resources because the \n20  bestowment  of  501(c)(3)  status  does  not,  by  and  in  itself,  provide  the  501(c)(3) \n21  organization with federal money, property, or services.  In fact, the benefit of not having \n22  to pay certain taxes is realized only if the tax-exempt organization earns income which \n23  would  otherwise  be  taxed.  See  Exemption  Requirements  -  501(c)(3)  Organizations, \n24  INTERNAL  REVENUE  SERVICE,  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-\n25  organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations (Feb. 6, 2023).  An entity with \n26 \n \n1 In United States Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, 477 \n27 \nU.S. 597, 607 (1986), the Supreme Court acknowledged that, “although ‘financial’ usually \nindicates ‘money,’ federal financial assistance may take nonmoney form.”  In so stating, \n28 \nhowever, the court referred only to an airport runway, which is a similarly tangible benefit, \nand also a benefit specifically included in the Department of Education definition.   \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 5 of 9\n \n \n \n1  501(c)(3) status may or may not have taxable income. Thus, while the IRS designation may \n2  allow a tax-exempt entity to allocate more resources toward its mission rather than to the \n3  payment of taxes, the entity may not be assisted by that benefit if the entity does not have \n4  otherwise taxable income.  In other words, the IRS’s designation does not ensure an \n5  organization will receive  any benefit.    \n6  Plaintiffs also argue that tax exempt status is comparable to the lease of federal \n7  property at nominal or reduced consideration—a category of assistance described in the \n8  fourth paragraph of the regulatory definition, 34 C.F.R. § 106.2(g)(4). (Doc. 131 at 16 ¶¶ \n9  1-13.) The Court concludes the two are not comparable. In the lease of government \n10  property, even at nominal consideration, the government directly provides to the recipient \n11  a tangible federal resource. In contrast, in granting tax-exempt status to an organization, \n12  the organization does not receive a direct or certain benefit; the organization will be \n13  “assisted financially” only if it receives certain independent donations or earns taxable \n14  income that is related to its exempt purpose. 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 170, 501(c)(3). \n15  The Court finds Johnny's Icehouse, Inc. v. Amateur Hockey Ass'n Illinois, Inc., 134 \n16  F. Supp. 2d 965 (N.D. Ill. 2001), persuasive.  There the district court in a Title IX case \n17  concluded that “the comprehensive definition of ‘federal financial assistance’ set out in the \n18  Department of Education’s regulation” did not include tax-exempt status because the \n19  benefit of such status was simply too indirect to constitute federal financial assistance.  Id. \n20  at 972.  According to the court, “‘federal financial assistance’ encompasses only direct \n21  transfers of federal  money,  property or services from the government to a program. \n22  Exemption from taxation just does not equate to such direct transfers.” Id. at 972 (internal \n23  citation omitted). The court noted that its conclusion was consistent with the Spending \n24  Clause foundation for Title IX which is contractual in nature, and explained, “[w]hen the \n25  government offers to transfer money or property to an entity to support an educational \n26  program or activity, the intended recipient has the choice whether or not to accept the \n27  assistance and the concomitant obligation not to discriminate on the basis of sex.” Id.  \n28  The Supreme Court has repeatedly focused on the contractual nature of Spending \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 6 of 9\n \n \n \n1  Clause legislation. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981) \n2  (emphasizing that legislation enacted under the Spending Clause has a contractual nature: \n3  in  return  for  federal  funds,  the  recipient  agrees  to  comply  with  federally  imposed \n4  conditions); Paralyzed Veterans of America, 477 U.S. at 605 (explaining that under Title \n5  VI, Title IX, and § 504, Congress enters into an arrangement in the nature of a contract \n6  with the recipients of the funds: the recipient's acceptance of the funds triggers coverage \n7  under the nondiscrimination provision); Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, \n8  524 U.S. 274, 286 (1998) (noting that Title IX operates in the same manner as Title VI, \n9  conditioning an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, \n10  in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government and the recipient of \n11  funds). Yet there is no indication that Congress intended to condition the receipt of \n12  501(c)(3)  tax  exempt  status  on  an  entity’s  promise  to  comply  with  federal \n13  antidiscrimination  statutes.  As  the  Johnny’s  Icehouse  court  stated,  “Congress  may \n14  condition tax-exempt status on an organization conforming to specific categories in Section \n15  501(c)(3), [but] that was not the power that Congress invoked to subject entities to the \n16  nondiscrimination requirements of Title IX.” 134 F.Supp.2d at 972.   \n17  Plaintiffs cite Grove City College v. Ball, 465 U.S. 555, 564 (1984), in arguing that \n18  both direct and indirect financial assistance trigger coverage under Title IX and that \n19  “financial assistance” should be construed broadly to include tax-exempt status. In Ball, \n20  the Supreme Court held that Grove City College was required to comply with Title IX \n21  because  it  accepted  federal  financial  assistance  indirectly  through  its  students,  who \n22  financed their educations with federal grants. Id. at 570. But Ball is distinguishable.  \n23  Although Ball recognizes that financial assistance may be indirect, the indirect benefit \n24  received  by the college was itself an actual tangible financial benefit – money. Tax-exempt \n25  status does not necessarily provide an actual or certain benefit. And, unlike the college in \n26  Ball,  TGS  has  not  received  or  accepted  federal  funds,  either  directly  or  through  an \n27  intermediary.   \n28  Plaintiffs also rely on Fulani v. League of Women Voters Education Fund.  But like \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 7 of 9\n \n \n \n1  Ball, in Fulani, the defendant non-profit organization received federal funds.  In fact, the \n2  organization received hundreds of thousands of dollars in direct federal funding from two \n3  government agencies. 684 F. Supp. at 1187.  There, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant \n4  fell under the purview of Title VI and Title IX, “as a recipient of federal funds,” id. at 1189, \n5  and the court concluded that the statutes applied to the defendant, at least in part, based on \n6  the organization’s receipt of the federal grants, id. at 1192. Here, the parties agree that TGS \n7  has not received any federal funds. \n8    Plaintiffs cite Valley Christian and Baltimore Lutheran, both of which hold that \n9  501(c)(3) tax exempt status constitutes federal financial assistance under Title IX in light \n10  of the purpose of that statute. See Valley Christian, 616 F. Supp. 3d at 1050 (looking to \n11  “the plain purpose of the statute,” which is “to eliminate discrimination in programs or \n12  activities benefitting from federal financial assistance.”); Baltimore Lutheran, 2022 WL \n13  2869041, at *3 (cleaned up) (“Enforcing the mandates of Title IX in schools with 501(c)(3) \n14  status aligns with and protects the principal objectives of Title IX[.]”). Similarly, in \n15  McGlotten, the D.C. Circuit considered significant the statutory purpose of the Civil Rights \n16  Act  in  determining  whether  certain  tax  code  provisions  constituted  federal  financial \n17  assistance in relation to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. 338 F. Supp. at 461 (D.C. Cir. \n18  1972).2  But concluding that a particular “grant” or “arrangement” constitutes “federal \n19  financial assistance” if it advances the purpose of an anti-discrimination statute begs the \n20  question of what constitutes federal financial assistance. As the Supreme Court has stated, \n21  under Title VI, Title IX, and § 504, a recipient's acceptance of federal funds triggers \n22  coverage under the nondiscrimination provision, not the other way around. See Paralyzed \n23  Veterans of America, 477 U.S. at 605. Indeed, the Supreme Court’s discussion of statutory \n24  purpose has always been in the context of the contractual nature of Spending Clause \n25  legislation. For example, in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), the \n26 \n \n2 The McGlotten court concluded that the clearly-indicated Congressional policy against \n27 \nracial discrimination required that Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(8), which allows \ndeduction of contributions to fraternal orders, be construed to disallow the deduction for \n28 \ncontributions to fraternal orders that excluded non-whites from membership. Id. \n \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 8 of 9\n \n \n \n1  court stated that the principal objective of Title IX is “to avoid the use of federal resources \n2  to support discriminatory practices in education programs.” Id. at 704  (emphasis added). \n3  In Paralyzed Veterans, the court held that Congress would require contractors to “bear the \n4  costs of providing employment for the handicapped as a quid pro quo for the receipt of \n5  federal funds.” 477 U.S. at 605.  Likewise, in Grove City College, the Supreme Court noted \n6  that the college was free to terminate participation in the federal grant program and thus \n7  avoid the requirements of Title IX. 465 U.S. at 475. As applied here, TGS is subject to \n8  Title IX and section 504 only if TGS received federal resources. The purpose of a statute \n9  is not determinative of whether 501(c)(3) status is a federal benefit.    \n10    Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status is not \n11  the type of grant or arrangement that qualifies as federal financial assistance.  Accordingly, \n12  the Complaint fails to state cognizable Title IX and Rehabilitation claims against TGS. \n13  III.  TITLE III ADA CLAIM \n14  A complaint should not be dismissed unless “it appears beyond doubt that the \n15  plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” \n16  Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334, 1337 (9th Cir. 1986) (cleaned up). Under Rule 8, \n17  Fed. R. Civ. P., a complaint must include only “a short and plain statement of the claim \n18  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). “Such a statement \n19  must simply give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds \n20  upon which it rests.” Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002). \n21    TGS argues that the Complaint fails to allege an ADA claim against TGS because \n22  the section of the ADA referenced in the Complaint is Title II, which applies to public \n23  entities, not private ones. TGS acknowledges that the ADA applies to TGS under Title III \n24  of the ADA, but requests that the Court require Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint to make \n25  clear that their claim is brought under Title III. (Docs. 37 at 7; 77 at 7-8.)  Plaintiffs argue \n26  that the Complaint as written broadly alleges a claim under Title III.  The heading for Count \n27  III asserts an ADA claim by reference to 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (Doc. 1, ¶19.)  42 U.S.C. \n28  § 12101 et seq. includes both Title II of the ADA for public entity defendants (42 U.S.C. § \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 172   Filed 12/11/23   Page 9 of 9\n \n \n \n1  12132) and Title III of the ADA for private defendants operating public accommodations \n2  (42 U.S.C. § 12182). TGS, a private school, could only be liable under Title III.  \n3  The Complaint gives TGS fair notice of what the Plaintiff's claim is and the grounds \n4  upon which it rests. Although the body of the Complaint  cites 42 U.S.C. § 12132 rather \n5  than 42 U.S.C. § 12182, the Complaint also references 42 U.S.C. § 12101, which includes \n6  both Title II and Title III claims.  The parties acknowledge in their filings that TGS could \n7  only be liable under Title III. Thus, the Court will deny TGS’s motion to dismiss Count III \n8  for failure to state a claim.   \n9  Accordingly, \n10  IT IS ORDERED TGS’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 37) is granted in part and \n11  denied in part.

(Doc. \n17  211.) On June 21, 2024, Intervenor-Defendants filed a Motion for Stay Pending Appeal \n18  stating their intention to seek a Writ of Mandamus from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n19  (Doc. 212.) If their Motion for Stay is denied, Intervenor-Defendants request this Court \n20  grant a 21-day administrative stay to allow time for the Ninth Circuit to consider a motion \n21  for stay and request for administrative stay. (Id.) Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. (Doc. 214.) \n22  For the following reasons, the Court will deny Intervenor-Defendants’ Motion for Stay \n23  Pending Appeal and Request for Administrative Stay.  \n24  Mandamus is a “drastic” remedy reserved for “extraordinary situations.” Bauman v. \n25  U.S. Dist. Ct., 557 F.2d 650, 654 (9th Cir. 1977). A petitioner must demonstrate that the \n26  “right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.” Bozic v. U.S. Dist. Ct. (In re Bozic), \n27  888 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2018). The Ninth Circuit considers five factors when \n28  examining a petition for issuance of a writ of mandamus: whether (1) Petitioners have “no \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 218   Filed 07/12/24   Page 2 of 3\n \n \n \n1  other  adequate  means,  such  as  a  direct  appeal,  to  attain  the  relief  ...  desire[d]”;  (2) \n2  Petitioners “will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal”; (3) the \n3  “district court's order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law”; (4) the “order is an oft-\n4  repeated error, or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules”; and (5) the “order \n5  raises new and important problems, or issues of law of first impression.” Bauman, 557 F.2d \n6  at 654-55. The absence of factor three will always defeat a petition for mandamus. Sussex \n7  v. U.S. Dist. Ct. (In re Sussex), 781 F.3d 1065, 1071 (9th Cir. 2015). \n8  When considering whether to grant a stay pending appeal, “a court considers four \n9  factors: (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to \n10  succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; \n11  (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the \n12  proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 \n13  (2009) (internal quotation omitted). “[A] movant’s failure to satisfy the stringent standard \n14  for demonstrating a substantial likelihood of success on the merits is an arguably fatal flaw \n15  for a stay application.” M.M.V. v. Barr, 459 F. Supp. 3d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2020).  \n16  The Intervenor-Defendants have not made a substantial showing that they are likely \n17  to succeed on a request for the extraordinary relief of mandamus. In granting Plaintiffs’ \n18  Motion to Compel, the Court concluded that: (1) the Intervenor-Defendants waived their \n19  legislative privilege by intervening in this litigation and putting their motives at issue, and \n20  (2) the Morgan Doctrine, which protects high ranking government officials from being \n21  unduly entangled in civil litigation, does not apply to prevent Intervenor-Defendants from \n22  being  deposed  where  they  voluntarily  intervened.  (See  Doc.  211.)  The  Intervenor-\n23  Defendants disagree, re-urging the arguments presented in their Objection to Plaintiffs’ \n24  Motion to Compel. (See Docs. 198, 212.) These arguments have been addressed by the \n25  Court and found to be without merit. \n26  Intervenor-Defendants  are  unlikely  to  succeed  on  their  claim  that  Legislative \n27  Privilege  shields  Intervenor-Defendants from producing  certain  documents  and  being \n28  deposed. As Intervenor-Defendants acknowledge, (Doc. 212 at 3 nt. 1), in a similar case \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 218   Filed 07/12/24   Page 3 of 3\n \n \n \n1  brought by the same Intervenor-Defendants, the Ninth Circuit ultimately concluded that \n2  the  district  court  did  not  clearly  err  in  determining  that  the  legislators  waived  their \n3  legislative privilege by intervening in the action. See In re Toma, 2023 WL 8167206, at *1 \n4  (9th Cir. Nov. 24, 2023) (unpublished) (reasoning that the district court could not clearly \n5  err where no Ninth Circuit authority prohibited the course taken by the district court). \n6  Intervenor-Defendants are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the  Morgan \n7  Doctrine shields Intervenor-Defendants from being deposed. The Morgan doctrine serves \n8  to protect high ranking officials from being “unduly entangled” in civil litigation. In re \n9  Gold King Mine Release in San Juan Cnty., 2021 WL 3207351, at *2 (D.N.M. Mar. 20, \n10  2021). The underlying rationale of protecting high ranking officials from being forced to \n11  participate in litigation is not applicable where the high ranking officials request to and \n12  voluntarily insert themselves as a party to a litigation and actively request discovery from \n13  other parties. Though Intervenor-Defendants argue that intervention does not affect the \n14  Morgan doctrine’s application, they cite no relevant caselaw that would suggest this Court \n15  clearly erred in reaching its conclusion. See In re U.S. Dep't of Educ., 25 F.4th 692, 698 \n16  (9th Cir. 2022) (“[T]he district court has erred when [the Ninth Circuit] has already directly \n17  addressed the question at issue or when similar cases from [the Ninth Circuit], cases from \n18  the Supreme Court, cases from other circuits, the Constitution, or statutory language \n19  definitively show us that a mistake has been committed.”). Accordingly,  \n20  IT IS ORDERED that Intervenor-Defendant’s Motion for Stay Pending Appeal \n21  and Request for Administrative Stay (Doc. 212) is denied.  \n22    Dated this 12th day of July, 2024. \n23   \n \n24 \n \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 3 - ",

(Doc. 156.) Defendant Horne has filed a Response and a Cross-Motion for \n17  Advisory Jury. (Doc. 159.) The motions are fully briefed. (Docs. 161, 163.) For the \n18  following reasons, the Court will grant the Motion to Strike the Demand for Jury Trial and \n19  Deny the Motion for Advisory Jury. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  In this action, Plaintiffs request the Court (1) permanently enjoin Defendants from \n22  enforcing A.R.S. § 15-120.02 against them, and (2) declare the enforcement of A.R.S. § \n23  15-120.02 violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause1, Title IX, the \n24  Americans with Disability Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (Doc. 1 \n25  at 16-20.) A.R.S. § 15-120.02 prohibits Plaintiffs, two transgender girls, from participating \nin interscholastic or intramural sports at their middle schools.  \n26 \n27 \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claim is asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 “to redress \n28 \nthe deprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution.” (Doc. 1, ¶ 14.)  \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 177   Filed 01/05/24   Page 2 of 6\n \n \n \n1  Defendant Horne filed a demand for jury trial, pursuant to Rule 38(b) of the Federal \n2  Rules of Civil Procedure, on all issues triable of right by a jury. (Doc. 56.) Plaintiffs have \n3  moved to strike the demand. (Doc. 156.) Plaintiffs also oppose Horne’s cross-motion for \n4  an advisory jury. (Doc. 161.)  \n5  ANALYSIS \n6  I.  Defendant Horne has no right to a jury trial  \n7  Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for the “right of trial by \n8  jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution—or as provided by a \n9  federal statute . . . [o]n any issue triable of right by a jury.” When the right to a jury trial is \n10  at issue, the court first looks to whether Congress has provided a statutory right to a jury \ntrial, and, in the absence of an explicit right, the Court determines whether the right to a \n11 \njury trial exists under the Seventh Amendment. Smith v. Barton, 914 F.2d 1330, 1336 (9th \n12 \nCir. 1990) (“[B]efore addressing the constitutional issue, we first analyze whether the \n13 \nstatute itself expresses any intent to grant plaintiffs a jury trial.”); Sakhrani v. City of San \n14 \nGabriel, No. 216CV01756CASPLAX, 2017 WL 507209, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2017) \n15 \n(“Because there is no express statutory right to a jury trial in this case, the Court examines \n16 \nwhether defendants are entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.”).  \n17 \nDefendant does not claim an express statutory right to a jury trial under 42 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 1983, Title IX, the ADA, or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Court finds \n19 \nthat none exists. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, \n20 \n707 (1999) (explaining 42 U.S.C. § 1983 “does not itself confer the jury right.”); Doe v. \n21 \nBd. Of Regents of Univ. of Nebraska, No. 4:21CV3049, 2023 WL 2351687, at *2 (D. Neb. \n22 \nMar. 3, 2023) (“[T]he provisions of Title IX do not contain explicit textual authorization \n23 \nfor a jury trial.”); Alvarado v. Cajun Operating Co., 588 F.3d 1261, 1270 (9th Cir. 2009) \n24 \n(“[N]o jury trial is available” where ADA claims seek only equitable relief.); Lutz v. \n25 \nGlendale Union High Sch., 403 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir. 2005) (as with the ADA, the \n26 \nRehabilitation Act does not provide for a right to a jury trial on equitable claims).  \n27 \nDefendant Horne is not entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment \n28 \nbecause Plaintiffs seek only equitable relief. The Seventh Amendment preserves the right \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 177   Filed 01/05/24   Page 3 of 6\n \n \n \n1  to trial by jury of all legal claims, but no right to a jury exists for equitable claims. See \n2  Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2001). To determine whether a claim is \n3  legal or equitable, the Court must first “compare the statutory action to 18th-century actions \n4  brought in the courts of England prior to the merger of the courts of law and equity,” and \n5  second, “examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in \n6  nature.” Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 417 (1987). The nature of the remedy is the \n7  more important of the two prongs. Id. at 421.  \n8  The parties do not address whether Plaintiffs’ statutory claims parallel any 18th-\n9  century actions at law or equity. In Smith v. Barton, the Ninth Circuit determined that \n10  similar claims2 could have been brought in 18th-century courts of law or courts of equity, \ndepending on the relief sought. 914 F.2d at 1337. Determining the first factor unpersuasive \n11 \nauthority either for or against the jury trial, the court turned to the second, “and more \n12 \nimportant  factor,”  the  characterization  of  the  relief  sought  by  plaintiffs.  Id.  Finding \n13 \nplaintiffs sought not only injunctive and declaratory relief, which would be equitable in \n14 \nnature, but also compensatory money damages—the “traditional form of relief offered in \n15 \nthe courts of law”—the court held that Plaintiffs were entitled to a jury trial on their claims. \n16 \nId.  \n17 \nHere, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys’ fees. (Doc. \n18 \n1 at 20.) Injunctive relief and attorneys' fees are equitable remedies. City of Monterey, 526 \n19 \nat U.S. 719 (“[T]he Seventh Amendment does not apply” in the context of “suits seeking \n20 \nonly injunctive relief.”); Finato v. Fink, 803 F. App'x 84, 89 (9th Cir. 2020) (“[T]he \n21 \nreasonable amount of attorneys' fees ... is an equitable claim that does not carry a Seventh \n22 \nAmendment right to a jury trial.”). Declaratory relief, on the other hand, “is neither strictly \n23 \n24 \n \n2  The Smith plaintiffs claimed they were constructively discharged, in violation of section \n25 \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because of their disabilities, and that their employer’s \nreorganization was a retaliatory measure instituted because of their membership in a \n26 \nparticular organization and, therefore, along with their discharge, a violation of their First \nAmendment right of free association and their Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process \n27 \nand equal protection under the law. Smith v. Barton, 914 F.2d at 1332-33. The Ninth Circuit \nconcluded that, “[a]lthough there were no discrimination actions at common law, plaintiffs' \n28 \naction [was] most closely analogous either to an 18th–century tort action or an action \nbrought to enforce an express or implied employment contract.” Id. at 1337. \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 177   Filed 01/05/24   Page 4 of 6\n \n \n \n1  equitable nor legal,” but rather depends on “the nature of the underlying controversy.” \n2  Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. DiGregorio, 811 F.2d 1249, 1251 (9th Cir. 1987); \n3  Pac. Indem. Co. v. McDonald, 107 F.2d 446, 448 (9th Cir. 1939).3 If the issue would have \n4  been tried to a jury had it arisen outside of the declaratory judgment action, then a jury trial \n5  right exists; however, if declaratory relief is the counterpart of a suit in equity, there is no \n6  right to a jury trial. Marseilles Hydro Power, LLC v. Marseilles Land & Water Co., 299 \n7  F.3d 643, 649 (7th Cir. 2002); see Hernandez v. Cnty. Of Monterey, 306 F.R.D. 279, 293 \n8  (N.D. Cal. 2015) (“Because Plaintiffs seek only equitable relief in the form of a permanent \n9  injunct[ion] and declaratory relief, a jury trial simply is not available.”); see Hope Medical \n10  Enterprises, Inc. v. Fagron Compounding Services, LLC, No. 219CV07748CASPLAX, \n2021 WL 2941546, at *5 (C.D. Cal. July 12, 2021) (plaintiff’s request for declaratory \n11 \njudgment did not entitle defendants to a jury trial because the additional remedies sought—\n12 \ndisgorgement of ill-gotten profits, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees—were equitable in \n13 \nnature).  \n14 \nHere, the declaratory relief prayed for by Plaintiffs is the counterpart of a suit in \n15 \nequity. First and foremost, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from enforcing A.R.S. § \n16 \n15-120.02 as it applies to them. Plaintiffs’ request for a declaration accompanying the \n17 \ninjunction is similarly equitable. Plaintiffs do not seek money damages nor any other legal \n18 \nremedy. Therefore, Defendant is not entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.  \n19 \nII.  The Court declines to empanel an advisory jury in this matter. \n20 \nIn an action not triable of right to a jury, the Court “may try any issue with an \n21 \nadvisory jury[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(c)(1). The decision to empanel an advisory jury is left \n22 \n23 \n \n \n24  3 Defendant Horne argues only that he is entitled to a jury trial on Plaintiffs’ claim for \ndeclaratory relief, citing Kam-Ko Biu-Pharm Trading Co. Ltd-Australia v. Mayne, 560 \n25 \nF.3d 935, 942 (9th Cir. 2009), to suggest that a party has “an absolute right to a jury” in \nany declaratory action, “unless a jury has been waived.” While it is true that the Kam-Ko \n26 \ncase includes such language, it is quite clear from the context of the case as well as other \nrelevant and binding authority, that the right to jury trial is dependent on the nature of the \n27 \nremedy sought, and that in Kam-Ko, the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial because it \nsought monetary damages for breach of contract. Id. at 939. More importantly, in Kam-Ko, \n28 \nthe plaintiff waived its jury-trial right. Id. at 943-44.  \n \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 177   Filed 01/05/24   Page 5 of 6\n \n \n \n1  entirely to the trial court's discretion. Kyei v. Oregon Dep't of Transp., 497 F. App'x 711, \n2  713 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n3  Defendant Horne argues that an advisory jury is warranted because a jury would not \n4  make the same factual errors that the Court has made in its ruling on the preliminary \n5  injunction; an advisory jury could provide the Court with a sense of how a group of Arizona \n6  citizens would find facts on the dispositive issues; and “an advisory jury will be crucial to \n7  provide the Court with a sense of how the effected community of Arizonans would \n8  determine the hotly-contested factual issues that will determine the outcome.” (Doc. 159 \n9  at 4; Doc. 163 at 2.)  \n10  For obvious reasons, the Court is not persuaded by Defendant’s argument that most \nof its factual findings have been erroneous. And, although jurors provide a valuable service \n11 \nin finding facts and applying the law in many cases, Defendant Horne’s reference to the \n12 \nadvisory jury as “the effected community” suggests that he seeks advisory jurors whose \n13 \npersonal beliefs about the propriety of A.R.S. § 15-120.02 might color their determination \n14 \nof the factual issues. Whether A.R.S. § 15-120.02 is constitutional, or whether A.R.S. § \n15 \n15-120.02 violates laws enacted by Congress, are not issues to be determined by popular \n16 \nvote.  \n17 \nIn its discretion, the Court will deny the request to empanel an advisory jury. The \n18 \nCourt is capable of evaluating expert medical testimony and, under the circumstances of \n19 \nthis case, would not likely benefit from the use of an advisory jury of citizens. Empaneling \n20 \nan advisory jury would not promote judicial economy; it would prolong proceedings and \n21 \nincrease costs while providing little benefit. See Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. \n22 \nDist., 267 F.R.D. 338, 339 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (denying request for advisory jury in a Title \n23 \nIX action because an advisory jury would have added unnecessary expense, time, and           \n24 \n// \n25 \n// \n26 \n// \n27 \n// \n28 \n \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 177   Filed 01/05/24   Page 6 of 6\n \n \n \n1  complexity to the case, and would not have assisted the court in fact-finding.)  \n2  Accordingly, \n3    IT IS ORDERED Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike Defendant Horne’s Demand for a \n4  Jury Trial (Doc. 156) is granted.  \n5  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Defendant’s Cross-Motion for an Advisory Jury \n6  (Doc. 159) is denied.  \n7  Dated this 5th day of January, 2024. \n8   \n9   \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 6 - ",

Plaintiffs assert that they have not undergone \n22  male puberty and do not have a competitive or physiological advantage over their non-\n23  transgender  peers  on  these teams.  Plaintiffs ask  the  Court  for declaratory  relief that \n24  enforcement by Defendants of Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02 violates Plaintiffs’ rights under \n25  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n26  Constitution, Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 \n27  U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 2 of 35\n \n \n \n1  The Arizona legislature adopted A.R.S. § 15-120.02, effective September 24, 2022, \n2  as follows: “Each interscholastic or intramural athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a \n3  public school or a private school whose students or teams compete against a public school \n4  shall be expressly designated as one of the following based on the biological sex of the \n5  students who participate on the team or in the sport: 1) ‘males,’ ‘men’ or ‘boys’; 2) \n6  ‘females,’  ‘women’  or  ‘girls,’  and  3)  ‘coed’  or  ‘mixed’.”  “Athletic  teams  or  sports \n7  designated for ‘females,’ ‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.” \n8  The statute does not apply to “restrict the eligibility of any student to participate in any . . \n9  .  athletic team or sport designated as being for males, men or boys or designated as coed \n10  or mixed.” The statute creates a private cause of action for injunctive relief and damages \n11  for any student for a deprivation of an athletic opportunity or who has suffered any direct \n12  or indirect harm as a result of a school knowingly violating this section. \n13  The Motion for Preliminary Injunction asks the Court to enjoin enforcement of \n14  A.R.S. § 15-120.02 by Defendant Horne and enjoin implementation of and compliance \n15  with the Act by Defendants Kyrene Middle School and The Gregory School (TGS) as to \n16  Plaintiffs. The Court has granted intervenor status to the legislators who adopted the Act. \n17  The Motion for Preliminary Injunction was fully briefed by all parties and the Intervenor \n18  Legislators (“Intervenors”). The Court will grant the Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n19  pursuant to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set out below. Defendant Arizona \n20  Interscholastic Association, Inc.’s (“AIA”) transgender policy, allowing transgender girls \n21  to play on teams consistent with their gender identity, complies with the terms of the \n22  preliminary injunction. \n23  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n24  On July 10, 2023, the Court heard oral argument and took evidence pertaining to \n25  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction.  Having  heard  oral  argument,  having \n26  examined the proofs1 offered by the parties, and having heard the arguments of counsel \n27 \n \n1 By stipulation, the parties offer proof by way of expert declarations filed in advance of \n28 \nthe hearing and by supplement thereafter. Accordingly, the Court references the evidence \nherein by CM/ECF document number, not as a trial exhibit. \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 3 of 35\n \n \n \n1  and being fully advised herein, the Court now finds generally in favor of Plaintiffs and \n2  against the Defendants, and hereby makes the following special Findings of Fact and \n3  Conclusions of Law pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 52(a) and (c) \n4  which constitutes the decision of the Court herein: \n5  I.  Findings of Fact \n6  To the extent these Findings of Fact are also deemed to be Conclusions of Law, they \n7  are hereby incorporated into the Conclusions of Law that follow. \n8  A.  Gender identity and gender dysphoria.  \n9  1. “Gender identity” is the medical term for a person’s internal, innate, deeply held \n10  sense of their own gender. (Dr. Daniel Shumer (“Shumer Decl.”) (Doc. 5) ¶ 18.) Everyone \n11  has a gender identity. (Id.)  \n12  2. “Gender identity” differs from “gender role,” which are behaviors, attitudes, and \n13  personality traits that a particular society considers masculine or feminine, or associates with \n14  male or female social roles. For example, the convention that girls wear pink and have longer \n15  hair, or that boys wear blue and have shorter hair, are socially constructed gender roles. \n16  Gender identity does not refer to socially contingent behaviors, attitudes, or personality traits; \n17  it is an internal and largely biological phenomenon. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶¶ 19-22.) \n18  3.  There is a consensus among medical organizations that gender identity is innate \n19  and cannot be changed through psychological or medical treatments. (Dr. Stephanie Budge \n20  Rebuttal (“Budge Decl. (Rebuttal)”) (Doc. 65-1) ¶ 31; Dr. Stephanie Budge (“Budge Decl.”) \n21  (Doc. 4) ¶ 21; Daniel Shumer Rebuttal (“Shumer Decl. (Rebuttal)”) (Doc. 65-2) ¶¶ 54–58; \n22  Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 23.)  \n23  4. When a child is born, a health care provider identifies the child’s sex based on the \n24  child’s observable anatomy. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 18; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 27.) This \n25  identification is known as an “assigned sex,” and in most cases turns out to be consistent \n26  with the person’s gender identity. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 18; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 27.) \n27    5. The term “biological sex” is not defined in the Act, but the Court finds that as used \n28  by Defendants it is synonymous with the term “assigned sex.” (See Declaration of Dr. James \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 4 of 35\n \n \n \n1  M. Cantor (“Cantor Decl.”) (Doc. 82-2; Doc. 92-2) ¶¶ 105-107; Declaration of Dr. Gregory \n2  A. Brown (“Brown Decl.”) (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶ 1; Dr. Emma Hilton (“Hilton Decl.”) (Doc. \n3  92-8) ¶¶1.8, ¶ 3.1-3.2 (explaining sex is an objective feature determined at the moment of \n4  conception; infants are born male or female, ascertainable by chromosomal analysis or visual \n5  inspection at birth).)2 \n6  6. For a transgender person, that initial designation does not match the person’s \n7  gender identity. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 18; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 27.) \n8    7. Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition characterized by significant and \n9  disabling distress due to the incongruence between a person’s gender identity and assigned \n10  sex. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 23; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 28.) Defendant Horne and \n11  Intervenors accept that gender dysphoria is a medical condition. (Preliminary Injunction, \n12  Oral Argument: July 10, 2023). \n13  8. Gender dysphoria is highly treatable. Every major medical association in the \n14  United States agrees that medical treatment for gender dysphoria is necessary, safe, and \n15  effective. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 25; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 30.) \n16     9.  “Transgender  individuals  may  experience  ‘gender  dysphoria,’  which  is \n17  ‘characterized by significant and substantial distress as result of their birth-determined sex \n18  being different from their gender identity.’ ‘In order to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, \n19  the incongruence must have persisted for at least six months and be accompanied by \n20  clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas \n21  of functioning.’ If left untreated, symptoms of gender dysphoria can include severe anxiety \n22  and depression, suicidality, and other serious mental health issues. Attempted suicide rates \n23  in the transgender community are over 40%.” Hecox v. Little, 479 F. Supp. 3d 930, 945-46 \n24  (D. Idaho 2020) (cleaned up), aff'd No. 20-35813, 2023 WL 1097255 (9th Cir. Jan. 30, \n25 \n \n2  From  a  medical  perspective,  the  terms  “biological  sex,”  “biological  male,”  and \n26 \n“biological female” are imprecise terms because a person’s sex encompasses several \ndifferent biological attributes, including sex chromosomes, certain genes, gonads, sex \n27 \nhormone levels, internal and external genitalia, other secondary sex characteristics, and \ngender identity, which may or may not be in alignment. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. \n28 \n113) ¶44 (citing Joshua D. Safer, Care of Transgender Persons, 381 N. Engl. J. Med. 2451 \n(2019)). \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 5 of 35\n \n \n \n1  2023). \n2    10. The major associations of medical and mental health providers in the United \n3  States, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \n4  the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the \n5  Pediatric Endocrine Society, have endorsed medical standards of care for treating gender \n6  dysphoria in adolescents, which were developed by the World Professional Association for \n7  Transgender Health (“WPATH”) and the Endocrine Society. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 31.)  \n8  11. The goal of medical treatment for gender dysphoria is to alleviate a transgender \n9  patient’s distress by allowing them to live consistently with their gender identity. (Budge \n10  Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 27; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 30.)  \n11  12. Undergoing treatment to alleviate gender dysphoria is commonly referred to as \n12  “transition” and includes one or more of the following components: (i) social transition, \n13  including  adopting  a  new  name,  pronouns,  appearance,  and  clothing,  and  correcting \n14  identity documents; (ii) medical transition, including puberty-delaying medication and \n15  hormone-replacement therapy; and (iii) for adults, surgeries to alter the appearance and \n16  functioning of primary- and secondary-sex characteristics. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶¶ 26–\n17  27; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 34.)  \n18  13. For social transition to be clinically effective, it must be respected consistently \n19  across all aspects of a transgender individual’s life. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 27.)  \n20  14. At the onset of puberty, adolescents with gender dysphoria may be prescribed \n21  puberty-delaying medications to prevent the distress of developing physical characteristics \n22  that conflict with the adolescent’s gender identity. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 28; Shumer \n23  Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 35.)  \n24  15. For older adolescents, doctors may also prescribe hormone therapy to induce the \n25  puberty associated with the adolescent’s gender identity. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 28; \n26  Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 36.)  \n27  16. When transgender adolescents are provided with appropriate medical treatment \n28  and have parental and societal support, they can thrive. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 29.)  \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 6 of 35\n \n \n \n1  17.  Untreated  gender  dysphoria  can  cause  serious  harm,  including  anxiety, \n2  depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide. (Budge Decl. (Doc. \n3  4) ¶ 33; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 28.)  \n4  18. Being denied recognition and support can cause significant harm, exacerbate \n5  gender dysphoria, and expose transgender adolescents to the risk of discrimination and \n6  harassment. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶¶ 33–34; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 28.) \n7  19. Attempts to “cure” transgender individuals by forcing their gender identity into \n8  alignment with their birth sex are harmful and ineffective. Those practices have been \n9  denounced as unethical by all major professional associations of medical and mental health \n10  professionals, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of \n11  Pediatrics,  the  American  Psychiatric  Association,  and  the  American  Psychological \n12  Association, among others. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 25.) \n13  B.  Plaintiffs are transgender girls who have not and will not experience male \n14  puberty.  \n15  20. Plaintiff Jane Doe is an 11-year-old transgender girl who will attend Kyrene \n16  Aprende Middle School beginning on July 19, 2023. (Jane Doe (“J. Doe Decl.”) (Doc. 6) \n17  ¶ 1; Helen Doe (Second) (“H. Doe 2nd Decl.”) (Doc. 78) ¶ 3.)  \n18  21. Jane has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life since she was five years old. (J. \n19  Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 2; Helen Doe (“H. Doe Decl.”) (Doc. 7) ¶¶ 3, 5.)  \n20  22. Jane was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was seven years old. (H. \n21  Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 7.)  \n22  23. Jane has changed her name through a court order to a more traditional female \n23  name and has a female gender marker on her passport. (Pls. Exs. 13 (Doc. 90-1), 15 (Doc. \n24  90-3).)  \n25  24. Jane has been monitored by her doctor for signs of the onset of puberty as part \n26  of her medical treatment for gender dysphoria. (H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 11.)  \n27  25. At an appointment on June 27, 2023, Jane’s doctor prescribed a Supprelin \n28  implant, which is a puberty-blocking medication. (Helen Doe (Third) (“H. Doe 3rd Decl.”) \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 7 of 35\n \n \n \n1  (Doc. 97-1) ¶ 4.)  \n2  26. Jane is in the process of scheduling the implant procedure for as soon as possible. \n3  (Id.)  \n4  27. Accordingly, Jane has not and will not experience any of the physiological \n5  changes that increased testosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy. (Shumer Decl. \n6  (Doc. 5) ¶ 45; Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 28.)   \n7  28. Sports are very important to Jane and her parents. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 5; H. \n8  Doe Decl. ¶ 12.)  \n9  29. Jane particularly loves playing soccer and has played soccer on girls’ club and \n10  recreational sports teams for nearly five years. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶¶ 6–8; H. Doe Decl. \n11  (Doc. 7) ¶ 12.)  \n12  30. Aside from its physical and emotional health benefits, soccer has helped Jane \n13  make new friends and connect with other girls. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 7; H. Doe Decl. \n14  (Doc. 7) ¶ 13.)  \n15  31. Jane’s teachers, coaches, friends, and members of her soccer team have all been \n16  supportive of Jane’s identity. (H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 9; Stipulation in Lieu of Answer \n17  (“Kyrene/Toenjes Stip.”) (Doc. 59) ¶ 1.)  \n18  32. When Jane enters Kyrene Aprende Middle School this July, she intends to \n19  participate and compete with the cross-country team and try out for the girls’ soccer and \n20  basketball teams. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 9; H. Doe 2nd Decl. (Doc. 78) ¶ 4.)  \n21  33. Both the soccer and basketball teams at Kyrene Aprende Middle School have \n22  separate teams for boys and girls. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 9.)  \n23  34. The cross-country team trains together, but boys and girls compete separately. \n24  (Id.)  \n25  35. Registration for the cross-country team began on July 1, 2023. (H. Doe 2nd Decl. \n26  (Doc. 78) ¶ 6.)  \n27  36. The registration occurs online and involves the submission of registration forms \n28  and supporting documents, such as a physical report signed by a doctor. (Id.)  \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 8 of 35\n \n \n \n1  37. Typically, a student’s registration takes at least two to three days to process after \n2  it is submitted. (Id.)  \n3  38. The first practice for cross country is on July 31, 2023, and the first cross-country \n4  competitive meet will occur the week of August 14, 2023. (Id. ¶ 7.)  \n5  39. Jane is excited to participate and compete on the girls’ teams with her friends \n6  and peers. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶¶ 8–9.)  \n7  40. If not for the Act, the Kyrene School District would permit Jane Doe to play on \n8  girls’ sports teams. (Kyrene/Toenjes Stip. (Doc. 59) ¶ 1.)  \n9  41. However, if the Act is applied to Jane, she will not be able to play on the girls’ \n10  soccer and basketball teams or compete with the girls’ cross-country team. (Id.)    \n11  42. Plaintiff Megan Roe is a 15-year-old transgender girl who attends TGS. (Megan \n12  Roe (“M. Roe Decl.”) (Doc. 8) ¶¶ 2, 5.)  \n13  43. Megan has always known she is a girl. (Kate Roe (“K. Roe Decl.”) (Doc. 9) ¶ \n14  3.)  \n15  44. Megan has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life since she was seven years old. \n16  (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 3; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶¶ 4–5.)  \n17  45. Through a court order, Megan has changed her name to a more traditional female \n18  name and her gender to female. (Pls.’ Ex. 14 (Doc. 90-2).) She also has a female gender \n19  marker on her passport. (Pls.’ Ex. 16 (Doc. 90-4).)  \n20  46. Megan was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was ten years old. (K. \n21  Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 6.)  \n22  47. Before starting school at TGS, Megan’s parents shared with administrators and \n23  teachers at the school that Megan is a transgender girl. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 5.) TGS \n24  has been very supportive of Megan and her identity. (Id.; Defendant TGS Motion to \n25  Dismiss (“TGS Mot. to Dismiss”) (Doc. 37) at 3.)  \n26  48. Megan has been taking puberty blockers since she was 11 years old as part of \n27  her medical treatment for gender dysphoria. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 6; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. \n28  9) ¶ 6.) This prevented Megan from undergoing male puberty. (K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 6.)  \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 9 of 35\n \n \n \n1  49. Megan began receiving hormone therapy when she was 12 years old. (M. Roe \n2  Decl. ¶ 6; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 6.)  \n3  50. As a result of the puberty blockers and hormone therapy, Megan has not \n4  experienced the physiological changes that increased testosterone levels would cause in a  \n5  pubescent boy. (K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 6; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 47; Budge Decl. (Doc. \n6  4) ¶ 29.)  \n7  51. The hormone treatment that she has received has caused Megan to develop many \n8  of the physiological changes associated with puberty in females. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ \n9  47; see also Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 29.) \n10  52. Sports have always been a part of Megan’s life. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 4.)  \n11  53. When she was about seven years old, Megan joined a swim team. (K. Roe Decl. \n12  (Doc. 9) ¶ 7.)  \n13  54. The coach of the swim team was supportive of Megan and her gender identity. \n14  (Id.)  \n15  55. Megan intends to try out for the girls’ volleyball team at TGS for this year’s fall \n16  season. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 7.)  \n17  56. Volleyball is an important part of the TGS community and many students attend \n18  the games. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 8; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 8.)  \n19  57. Megan is excited to play on the girls’ volleyball team with her friends. (M. Roe \n20  Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 7; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 8.)  \n21  58. Megan’s teammates, coaches, and school are highly supportive of her and would \n22  welcome her participation on the girls’ volleyball team. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 5; K. Roe \n23  Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 5; TGS Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. 37) at 3; Dr. Julie Sherrill (“Sherrill Decl.”) \n24  (Doc. 37-1) ¶ 5.)  \n25  59. If not for the Act, TGS would permit Megan to play on the girls’ volleyball team. \n26  (Sherrill Decl. (Doc. 37-1) ¶ 5.)  \n27  60. If the Act is applied to Megan, she will not be able to compete with the girls’ \n28  volleyball team. (Id.) \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 10 of 35\n \n \n \n1  C.  Prior to enactment of A.R.S. § 15-120.02, Plaintiffs would have been allowed \n2  to play on girls’ sports teams.  \n3  61. Defendant AIA sets rules for governing interscholastic sports, grades 9-12, and \n4  cutoff age of 19, for member schools, with membership being voluntary, but compliance \n5  with AIA rules being mandatory for all membership schools. (AIA Constitution; Article 2. \n6  Membership (Doc. 51-1).) \n7  62.  Each  school  or  school  district  set  its  own  rules  on  transgender  students’ \n8  participation in intramural sports. (Id. ¶¶ 2.5.2–3 (vesting “[f]inal authority and ultimate \n9  responsibilities in all matters pertaining to interscholastic activities of each school shall be \n10  vested in the school principal,” with school administration assuming responsibility for \n11  verification of all student eligibility rules).)  \n12  63. Prior to the enactment of the Act, A.R.S. § 15-120.02, transgender girls in \n13  Arizona were permitted to play on girls’ sports teams, under the AIA Constitution, Bylaws, \n14  Policies and Procedures § 41.9, as follows: “[A]ll students should have the opportunity to \n15  participate in Arizona Interscholastic Association activities in a manner that is consistent \n16  with their gender identity, irrespective of the sex listed on a student’s eligibility for \n17  participation in interscholastic athletics or in a gender that does not match the sex at birth.” \n18  (AIA Resp., Ex. 1 (Doc. 51-1).)  \n19  64. By December 2018, the AIA formalized its policy to permit transgender students \n20  to play on teams consistent with their gender identity so long as they had a letter of support \n21  from  their  parent  or  guardian  explaining  when  they  realized  they  were  transgender. \n22  (Compl. (Doc. 1) ¶ 21; AIA Answer (Doc. 50) ¶ 21; AIA Transgender Policy § 41.9 (Doc. \n23  51-1).)  \n24  65. Under the AIA policy, a student request to play on a team consistent with his or \n25  her gender identity is reviewed by a committee of medical and psychiatric experts, and \n26  consistent with AIA health and safety policy and if not motivated by an improper purpose, \n27  the request is approved or denied. (AIA Resp., Ex. 1 (Doc. 51-1) §  41.9.3; Consideration \n28  of Bills: Hearing on S.B. 1165 Before S. Comm. on Judiciary, Jan. 20, 2022, 55th Leg., 2d \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 11 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Reg. Sess. 50:12–52 (Ariz. 2022).) \n2  66.  In the past 10 to 12 years, the AIA fielded approximately 12 requests consistent \n3  with their policy and approved seven students to play on a team consistent with their gender \n4  identity. Consideration of Bills: Hearing on S.B. 1165 Before S. Comm. on Judiciary, Jan. \n5  20, 2022, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. 52:10 (Ariz. 2022). \n6  67. The parties do not provide the Court with a breakdown of the gender identity for \n7  these seven transgender students but even assuming they were all transgender girls, the \n8  Court finds that seven students over 10 to 12 years is not a substantial number, particularly \n9  when compared to the “roughly 170,000 students playing sports in Arizona.” (Preliminary \n10  Injunction, Oral Argument: July 10, 2023).3  \n11  68. Less than one percent of the population is transgender, with male and female \n12  transgender people being roughly the same in number. Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977–78. \n13  “Presumably, this means approximately one half of one percent of the population is made \n14  up of transgender females. It is inapposite to compare the potential displacement allowing \n15  approximately half of the population (cisgender[4] men) to compete with cisgender women, \n16  with any potential displacement one half of one percent of the population (transgender \n17  women) could cause cisgender women. It appears untenable that allowing transgender \n18  women to compete on women's teams would substantially displace female athletes.” Id. at \n19  977-978. \n20  69. The Arizona Bill Summary for the Act, SB 1165 transmitted to the Governor on \n21  May  11,  2022,  expressly  cites  the  AIA’s  “policy  allowing  transgender  students  to \n22  participate in activities in a manner consistent with their gender identity.

S.B. 1165, Bill Summary). \n \n24  3 The record is missing the relevant number of participants in girls’ sports and in sports \ngenerally over this same 10-to-12-year period. Based on its independent research, the Court \n25 \naccepts the 170,000 number as representing the total number of students playing sports per \nyear because in 2018-19, there were 52,817 girls and 68,520 boys playing sports in \n26 \nArizona. https://www.statista.com/statistics/202219/us-high-school-athletic-participation-\nin-arizona. \n27 \n \n4 “The term ‘cisgender’ refers to a person who identifies with the sex that person was \n28 \ndetermined to have at birth.” Hecox, 479 F.

Despite enactment of the Act, the AIA has not changed its transgender policy. \n2  (AIA Resp. (Doc. 51) at 5.)  Yet, organizations like the AIA do not have discretion to \n3  disregard validly enacted laws of the State of Arizona. (AIA Resp. (Doc. 51) at 4.) \n4  71. The Act prohibits “any licensing or accrediting organization or any athletic \n5  association  or  organization,”  including  the  AIA,  from  “entertain[ing]  a  complaint, \n6  open[ing]  an  investigation  or  tak[ing]any  other  adverse  action  against  a  school  for \n7  maintaining separate interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or sports for students of \n8  the female sex.”  A.R.S. § 15-120.02(D). \n9  72. The Act creates a private cause of action for students or schools to sue schools \n10  or organizations like the AIA if the school or organization violates the ban or retaliates in \n11  response to the reporting of a violation of the Act. A.R.S. § 15-120.02(F)-(G). \n12  D.  A.R.S. § 15-120.02 prevents Plaintiffs from playing on girls’ sports teams at \n13  their schools.  \n14  73. On March 30, 2022, Arizona enacted the Act (S.B. 1165), with an effective date \n15  of September 24, 2022. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02.  \n16  74. As of the effective date of the Act, School Year 2022-23, first quarter (July-\n17  September)  sports,  including  volleyball,  were  almost  over.  Second  quarter  (October-\n18  December) girls’ sports are softball and soccer.  The Third quarter (January-March) sports \n19  for girls, includes basketball. The Fourth quarter (March-May) sport is track and field. \n20  75. In School Year 2022-23, Megan was allowed to practice as a member of the \n21  team, but not allowed to participate in TGS interscholastic competitions (games). (TGS \n22  Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. 37) at 3, n3.)  \n23  76. In School Year 2022-23, Jane played soccer but not at her elementary school \n24  because it did not have a school team; she will attend Kyrene Middle School for the first \n25  time this year. (Preliminary Injunction, Oral Argument: July 10, 2023). \n26  77. The Court finds that the challenged conduct, passage of the Act precluding \n27  transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams, occurred at a time when the Plaintiffs \n28  had an opportunity to play on girls’ sports teams consistent with their gender identity.  \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 13 of 35\n \n \n \n1  78. Unlike the prior case-by-case basis used to approve a transgender girl’s request \n2  to play on a team consistent with her gender identity, which considered among other things \n3  the age and competitive  level relevant to the request, the  Act categorically bans all \n4  transgender girls’ participation by requiring each team that is sponsored by a public school \n5  or a private school team that competes against a public-school team to be designated as \n6  “male,” “female,” or “coed,” based on the “biological sex of the students who participate.” \n7  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(A).  \n8  79. The Act applies equally to kindergarten through college teams although the \n9  problems identified as being addressed by the Act-- opportunity and safety-- are limited to \n10  high school and college sports. See e.g. Consideration of Bills: Hearing on S.B. 1165 \n11  Before S. Comm. on Judiciary, Jan. 20, 2022, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess., 0:9:56 (Ariz. 2022) \n12  (Sharp testimony explaining problem being addressed is AIA policy that allows males in a \n13  matter of weeks to dominate a sport, break a girl’s record, and cause a girl to lose her \n14  championship or scholarship opportunity); same at 1:24:00 (Sen. Burley explanation for \n15  vote “yea” to protect integrity of high school sports by preventing victimization of girls \n16  that are trying to compete for sports scholarships).5 \n17  80. “Biological sex” is not defined in the statute. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02. \n18  However, the S.B. 1165 Legislative Findings state that for purposes of school sports, a \n19  student’s sex is determined at “fertilization and revealed at birth, or, increasingly, in utero.” \n20  S.B. 1165, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2022), § 2.  \n21  81. The Act states that “athletic teams or sports designated for ‘females’, ‘women’ \n22  or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02 (B).  \n23  82. The Act was adopted for the purpose of excluding transgender girls from playing \n24  on girls’ sports teams. See, e.g. Consideration of Bills: Hearing on S.B. 1165 Before S. \n25  Comm. on Judiciary, Jan. 20, 2022, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess., 1:17:32–39 (Ariz. 2022) \n26  (statement of Sen.

Precluding transgender girls, who have not experienced male puberty, from \n10  playing girls sports, treats transgender boys and transgender girls differently and treats \n11  boys’ and girls’ sports differently, with only girls’ teams facing potential challenges, \n12  including litigation, related to suspected transgender players.

Supp. 3d at 988 (explaining all biological women are subject, in the event \n17  of a challenge, to the statutory verification process in order to play on a team, and this \n18  creates a different, more onerous set of rules for women’s sports when compared to men’s \n19  sports).  \n20  84. Contrary to the asserted safety goal, the Act does not protect transgender boys—\n21  identified by Defendant Horne and Intervenors as “biological girls.” In fact, the Act allows \n22  “biological girls” to play on boys’ sports teams, subjecting them to the alleged risks of that \n23  association. This is allowed prepuberty and without regard for whether the transgender boy \n24  is receiving testosterone enhancements. \n25  85. The Act’s creation of a private cause of action against a school for any student \n26  who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any harm, whether direct or indirect, \n27  related to a schools’ failure to preclude participation of a transgender girl on a girls’ team \n28  places an onerous burden on girls’ sports programs, not faced by boys’ athletic programs.  \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 15 of 35\n \n \n \n1  86. The record does not support a finding that prior to the Act’s enactment, there \n2  was a problem in Arizona related to transgender girls replacing non-transgender girls on \n3  sports teams. Consideration of Bills: Hearing on S.B. 1165 Before S. Comm. on Judiciary, \n4  Jan. 20, 2022, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess., 1:15:30–36 (Ariz. 2022) (statement of Sen. Warren \n5  Petersen, Chairman, S. Comm. on Judiciary) (acknowledging to another Senator that \n6  “we’re not aware of a specific instance” where any cisgender girl had lost a place on a team \n7  to a transgender girl). \n8  87. The record does not support a finding that during the 10 to 12 years prior to \n9  passage of the Act there was a risk of any physical injury to or missed athletic opportunity \n10  by any girl as a result of allowing seven transgender girls to play on sports teams consistent \n11  with their gender identity.  \n12  E.  Excluding Plaintiffs from school sports causes very serious injury to \n13  Plaintiffs  \n14  88. School sports offer social, emotional, physical, and mental health benefits. \n15  (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶¶ 35–38.)  \n16  89. The social benefits of school sports include the opportunity to make friends and \n17  become part of a supportive community of teammates and peers. (Id. ¶ 35.)  \n18  90. School sports provide an opportunity for youth to gain confidence and reduce \n19  the effects of risk factors that lead to increases in depression. (Id. ¶ 36.)  \n20  91. Students who play school sports have fewer physical and mental health concerns \n21  than those that do not. (Id. ¶ 37.)  \n22  92. Students who participate in high school sports are more likely to finish college \n23  and participation in high school sports has a positive impact on academic achievement. (Id. \n24  ¶ 38.) \n25  93. It would be psychologically damaging for a transgender girl to be banned from \n26  playing school sports on equal terms with other girls. (Id. ¶ 39; Budge Decl. (Rebuttal) \n27  (Doc. 65-1) ¶ 10.)  \n28  94. Transgender girls will internalize the shame and stigma of being excluded for a \n \n- 15 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 16 of 35\n \n \n \n1  personal characteristic (being transgender) over which they have no control and which \n2  already subjects them to prejudice and social stigma. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 40.)  \n3  95. For transgender girls who are already playing on girls’ teams, a law that requires \n4  them to be excluded from continued participation on girls’ teams would have a further \n5  negative impact on their health and well-being, causing them to feel isolated, rejected, and \n6  stigmatized, and thereby putting them at high risk for severe depression and/or anxiety. \n7  (Id.) \n8  96.  For transgender girls, who are gender transitioning to address gender dysphoria, \n9  the benefits from playing sports on teams compatible with their gender identity is important \n10  because to be clinically effective, gender transitioning must be respected consistently \n11  across all aspects of her life.   \n12  F.  Transgender girls who have not undergone male puberty do not have an \n13  athletic advantage over other girls.  \n14  97. The Plaintiffs’ experts’ opinions are based on the scientific consensus that the \n15  biological cause of average differences in athletic performance between men and women \n16  is caused by the presence of circulating levels of testosterone beginning with male puberty. \n17  (Shumer Decl. (Rebuttal) (Doc 65-2) ¶ 8 (citing Brown Decl. ¶¶ 127–30 relying on \n18  Handelsman (2018) at 823 (“summarizing evidence makes it highly likely that the sex \n19  difference  in  circulating  testosterone  of  adults  explains  most,  if  not  all,  of  the  sex \n20  differences in sporting performance.”)); (Brown Hecox Decl. ¶¶ 20a, 25–28, 77–85). \n21  98. A large part of the record created by the Defendants is not relevant to the \n22  question  before  the  Court:  whether  transgender  girls  like  Plaintiffs,  who  have  not \n23  experienced  male  puberty,  have  performance  advantages  that  place  other  girls  at  a \n24  competitive disadvantage or at risk of injury. For example, Defendants submit evidence \n25  that girls have more body fat than boys at birth. (Brown Decl. (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶ 79.) \n26  Without more, this evidence is not relevant to the question before the Court.  \n27  99. Defendant Horne and the Intervenors submit expert declarations, including the \n28  declaration by Dr. James Cantor, which in large part are not relevant criticisms of medical \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 17 of 35\n \n \n \n1  treatments for gender dysphoria. The appropriateness of medical treatment for gender \n2  dysphoria is not at issue in this case. (Pls Ex. (Doc. 88-3) at 39-40 (dated March 30, 2022, \n3  describing purpose of Act to ensure a level playing by preventing unfair competition in \n4  women’s sports).) Protecting transgender girls from any such risk is not a rationale or \n5  purpose of the Act.  \n6  100.  Defendants’  expert  Dr.  Brown  admits  that  many  of  the  specific  male \n7  physiological advantages he describes are a result of testosterone levels in men post-\n8  puberty. This evidence is not relevant because the Plaintiffs have not and never will \n9  experience male puberty. The Court is not concerned with Dr. Brown’s opinion that such \n10  advantages are not reversed by testosterone suppression after puberty or are reduced only \n11  modestly, leaving a large advantage over female athletes. Dr. Brown agrees it is well \n12  documented that the large increases in physiological and performance advantages for men \n13  result from increases in circulating testosterone levels that males experience in puberty, “or \n14  generally between the ages of about 12 through 18.” (Brown Decl. (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶¶ \n15  163-164.)6 \n16  101. Defendants rely on school-based fitness testing of boys and girls, comparisons \n17  between  10th/50th/90th  percentile  scores  for  girl  and  boy  students  ages  6  through  11 \n18  reflecting, for example, that 50% of 6-year-old boys completed more laps in the 20-meter \n19  shuttle (14) than girls (12). (Brown Decl. (Doc. 82-1; 92-1) ¶ 84.) Other fitness data reflects \n20  differences between 9 through 17-year-old boys and girls, with 9-year-old boys always \n21  exceeding girls’ running times by various percentages ranging from 11.1-15.2%, id. ¶ 89; \n22  arm hang fitness scores (7.48 boys, 5.14 girls), id. ¶ 92; standing broad jump (128.3 boys, \n23  118.0 girls), id. ¶ 99.

The World Rugby Transgender Women’s Guidelines 2020 , which Dr. Brown \n14  cites throughout his declaration, allow transgender girls and women to participate in \n15  women’s rugby if they did not experience endogenous male puberty, stating: “Transgender \n16  women who transitioned pre-puberty and have not experienced the biological effects of \n17  testosterone during puberty and adolescence can play women’s rugby.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 24 (Doc. \n18  88-3); Shumer Decl.

The Court finds that transgender girls, who are being raised in conformance \n6  with their gender identity, will be subject to the same social/cultural factors that girls face \n7  that correlates to lower physical fitness scores. \n8  104. There is no evidence to support Dr. Hilton’s opinion that girls have “delicate \n9  brain structures” making them prone to injury; brain MRIs reveal no differences based on \n10  sex, except for size. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶ 40.) Evidence suggests the \n11  difference between male and female sports’ concussions occurs  because  girls, post-\n12  puberty, have weaker neck muscles than boys. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶ \n13  41 (citing Abigail C. Bretzin et al., Association of Sex with Adolescent Soccer Concussion \n14  Incidence and Characteristics, 4 JAMA Network Open 4, 6 (2021); Ryan T. Tierney et al., \n15  Gender  Differences  in  Head-Neck  Segment  Dynamic  Stabilization  During  Head \n16  Acceleration, 37 Med. & Sci. Sports & Exercise 272, 272 (2005)).  \n17  105. The Court rejects Dr. Hilton’s idea that “sporty-girls” will be “as well-trained \n18  as their male peers” and, therefore, higher win scores at Kyrene Middle School for boys \n19  cannot be explained by social cultural factors and must be biological. (Hilton Decl. (Doc. \n20  92-8)  (citing  Thomas  and  French,  1985,  Gender  differences  across  age  in  motor \n21  performance a meta-analysis: Psychol Bull 98(2): 260-282)).  \n22  106. Height differences in babies are negligible, with differences disappearing \n23  altogether between ages 6 and 8 but reappearing when girls enter puberty and overtake \n24  boys in height and weight for a few years until boys experience puberty and grow taller on \n25  average than girls/women. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶¶ 12-15.)  \n26  107. The Plaintiffs do not challenge the existence of separate teams for girls and \n27  boys. Defendants do not explain why the minor differences in physical fitness scores for \n28  prepuberty boys compared to girls reflect a significant athletic advantage of boys over girls, \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 20 of 35\n \n \n \n1  prepuberty. There are many other reasons why boys’ and girls’ sports teams are separated: \n2  (1) women historically were deprived of athletic opportunities in favor of men; (2) as a \n3  general matter, men had equal athletic opportunities to women; and (3) according to \n4  stipulated  facts,  average  physiological  differences  meant  that  “males  would  displace \n5  females to a substantial extent” if permitted to play on women's teams. See Hecox, 479 F. \n6  Supp. 3d at 976 (distinguishing Clark by and Through Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic \n7  Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126 (9th Cir. 1982) finding these factors do not apply for transgender \n8  women).  \n9  108. Defendants ask the Court to rely on evidence they allege supports separating \n10  sports teams by sex to conclude that transgender girls, who have not experienced puberty, \n11  should not play on girls’ teams solely because they are boys, regardless of whether they \n12  have experienced puberty. \n13  109. The Court will not make this leap because Plaintiffs present expert evidence \n14  that any prepubertal differences between boys and girls in various athletic measurements \n15  are minimal or nonexistent. (Shumer Decl. (Rebuttal) (Doc. 65-2) ¶ 5) (citing Alison \n16  McManus & Neil Armstrong, Physiology of elite young female athletes, 56 Medicine & \n17  Science Sports & Exercise 23, 24 (2011) (“Prior to 11 years of age differences in average \n18  speed are minimal”); id. at 27 (“[S]mall sex difference in fat mass and percent body fat are \n19  evident from mid-childhood”); id. at 29 (“[B]one characteristics differ little between boys \n20  and girls prior to puberty”); id. at 32 (“There is little evidence that prior to puberty \n21  pulmonary structure or function limits oxygen uptake”); id. at 34 (“[N]o sex differences in \n22  arterial compliance have been noted in pre- and early- pubertal children”)). \n23  110. Based on the evidence, transgender girls’ physical characteristics, especially in \n24  terms of height, weight, and strength, overlap with those of other girls. In other words, \n25  some girls may be taller than average, and some transgender girls may be taller than \n26  average.  The  rationale  for  excluding  transgender  girls  with  above  average  physical \n27  characteristics is equally applicable to excluding taller than average girls, but height, \n28  weight, or strength factors are not used at any level of competition to protect girls or women \n \n- 20 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 21 of 35\n \n \n \n1  athletes.

The categorical preclusion of transgender women, especially girls who have \n8  not experienced  male puberty, appears unrelated to the interests the Act purportedly \n9  advances. A “justification must be genuine, not hypothesized.” United States v. Virginia, \n10  518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). The proponents of the Act fail to provide persuasive evidence \n11  of any genuine, not hypothesized problem. Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 979. \n12  112. Before puberty, there are no significant differences in athletic performance \n13  between boys and girls. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶ 16; Shumer Decl. \n14  (Rebuttal) (Doc. 65-2) ¶¶ 9–13; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 38; Pls.’ Exs. 19–20, 22–23 (Doc. \n15  88-2).)  \n16  113. After puberty, adolescent boys begin to produce higher levels of testosterone, \n17  which over time causes them to become, on average, stronger and faster than adolescent \n18  girls. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 39; Pls.’ Exs. 18–19 (Doc. 88-2).)  \n19  114. The biological driver of average group differences in athletic performance \n20  between adolescent boys and girls is the difference in their respective levels of testosterone, \n21  which  only  begin  to  diverge  significantly  after  the  onset  of  puberty.  (Shumer  Decl. \n22  (Rebuttal) ¶¶ 4, 8; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 39; Pls.’ Exs. 18–19.)  \n23  115. Transgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication do not have an \n24  athletic advantage over other girls because they do not undergo male puberty and do not \n25  experience the physiological changes caused by the increased production of testosterone \n26  associated with male puberty. (Shumer Decl. (Rebuttal) (Doc. 65-2) ¶¶ 15–16; Shumer \n27  Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶¶ 35, 38–42.)  \n28  116.  Transgender  girls  who  receive  hormone  therapy  after  receiving  puberty-\n \n- 21 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 22 of 35\n \n \n \n1  blocking medication will develop the skeletal structure, fat distribution, and muscle and \n2  breast development typical of other girls. (Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶ 29; Shumer Decl. \n3  (Rebuttal) (Doc. 65-2) ¶ 22; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶¶ 35–36.)  \n4  117. A transgender girl who receives hormone therapy will typically have the same \n5  levels of circulating estrogen and testosterone as other girls. (Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 36.)  \n6  118. Knowing that a girl is transgender, if she has not gone through male puberty, \n7  reveals nothing about her athletic ability. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶ 31, 48; \n8  Shumer Decl. (Rebuttal) (Doc. 65-2) ¶¶ 26–27; Shumer Decl. (Doc. 5) ¶ 42.)  \n9  119. Similarly, transgender girls who have not yet undergone male puberty or who \n10  have received puberty-blocking medication at the onset of puberty do not present any \n11  unique safety risk to other girls. (Shumer Decl. (2nd Rebuttal) (Doc. 113) ¶¶ 25, 36; Shumer \n12  Decl. (Rebuttal) ¶ 41.)  \n13    120. In short, transgender girls, who have not experienced male puberty, play like \n14  girls. There is no logical connection between prohibiting them from playing on girls’ sports \n15  teams and the goals of preventing unfair competition in girls’ sports or protecting girls \n16  from being physically injured by boys.  \n17  G.  Plaintiffs cannot play on boys’ sports teams. \n18  121. Jane cannot play on boys’ teams or compete with the boys because she is a girl, \n19  with athletic capabilities like other girls her age and different from boys her age who are \n20  beginning to experience puberty and increased testosterone levels. Jane will not experience \n21  male puberty and will experience female puberty. Assuming there are safety issues created \n22  if girls compete with boys, Jane would be subjected to such risks by playing on boys’ \n23  teams.  \n24  122. Jane’s medical health depends on her ability to live her life fully as a girl, and \n25  playing on a boys’ sports team and competing against boys would directly contradict her \n26  medical treatment for gender dysphoria and jeopardize her health. (H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) \n27  ¶ 15; Budge Decl. (Doc. 4) ¶¶ 33–34.) \n28    123. “Participating in sports on teams that contradict one’s gender identity ‘is \n \n- 22 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 23 of 35\n \n \n \n1  equivalent to gender identity conversion efforts, which every major medical association \n2  has found to be dangerous and unethical.’” Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977. \n3  124. Jane would find it humiliating and embarrassing to play on a boys’ team \n4  because everyone at school knows her as a girl. (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 11; H. Doe Decl. \n5  (Doc. 7) ¶ 15.)  \n6  125. If she is not allowed to play sports on a girls’ team, Jane will be very upset. (J. \n7  Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 10; H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 16.)  \n8  126. Jane will not participate in sports at all if she is forced to be on a boys’ team. \n9  (J. Doe Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 11; H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 15.) The last thing she wants to do is \n10  draw attention to herself by drawing into question her gender identity. She wants to go to \n11  school like other girls. (Jane Decl. (Doc. 6) ¶ 11.) \n12  127. Jane will also lose the opportunity to receive the physical, social, and emotional \n13  benefits that school sports provide. (H. Doe Decl. (Doc. 7) ¶ 16).  \n14  128. Megan cannot play on boys’ teams or compete with the boys because she is a \n15  girl, with athletic capabilities like other girls her age and different from boys her age, who \n16  have experienced puberty and increased testosterone levels. Megan has not experienced \n17  male puberty and has experienced female puberty. Assuming there are safety issues created \n18  if girls compete with boys, Jane would be subjected to such risks by playing on boys’ \n19  teams.  \n20  129.  Playing  on  a  boys’  team  would  directly  conflict  with  Megan’s  medical \n21  treatment for gender dysphoria, and her medical health depends on her ability to live her \n22  life fully as a girl. Playing on a boys’ team would be emotionally painful and humiliating \n23  for her. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 9; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 10.)  \n24  130. “Participating in sports on teams that contradict one’s gender identity ‘is \n25  equivalent to gender identity conversion efforts, which every major medical association \n26  has found to be dangerous and unethical.’” Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977. \n27  131. If she is not allowed to play on the girls’ volleyball team, Megan will not \n28  compete on the boys’ volleyball team. (M. Roe Decl. (Doc. 8) ¶ 9; K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) \n \n- 23 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 24 of 35\n \n \n \n1  ¶ 10.)  \n2  132. Megan will be distraught if she loses the opportunity to try out for the girls’ \n3  volleyball team. (K. Roe Decl. (Doc. 9) ¶ 11.)  \n4  133. Megan will also lose the opportunity to receive the physical, social, and \n5  emotional benefits that school sports provide. (Id. ¶ 9.)  \n6  II.  Conclusions of Law \n7  To the extent these Conclusions of Law are also deemed to be Findings of Fact, they \n8  are hereby incorporated into the preceding Findings of Fact. \n9  134. A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” that is \n10  “never awarded as of right.” Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (citations \n11  omitted). Instead, in every case, the court must balance competing claims of injury and \n12  must consider the effect on each party of granting or withholding relief. Winter v. Natural \n13  Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008). \n14  135.  A  preliminary  injunction  may  take  one  of  two  forms:  1)  a  prohibitory \n15  injunction prohibits a party from taking action and “preserve[s] the status quo pending a \n16  determination of the action on the merits.” Chalk v. United States Dist. Court, 840 F.2d \n17  701, 704 (9th Cir. 1988). A mandatory injunction goes beyond simply maintaining the status \n18  quo and requires a heightened burden of proof and is particularly disfavored. Marlyn \n19  Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 879 (9th Cir. 2009) \n20  (citing Anderson v. United States, 612 F.2d 1112, 1114 (9th Cir. 1980)).  \n21  136. “Status quo” for the purpose of an injunction “refers to the legally relevant \n22  relationship between the parties before the controversy arose.” Arizona Dream Act Coal. \n23  v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir. 2014) (emphasis in original); see also Regents of \n24  Univ. of California v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 747 F.2d 511, 514 (9th Cir. 1984) (for \n25  purposes of injunctive relief, the status quo means “the last uncontested status which \n26  preceded the pending controversy”) (cleaned up).  \n27  137. For the purpose of issuing a preliminary injunction, the Court’s findings that \n28  both Jane and Megan could have played on girls’ sports teams last year prior to passage of \n \n- 24 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 25 of 35\n \n \n \n1  the Act, cannot play on sports teams consistent with their gender identity now, and want to \n2  participate in girls’ sports programs at Kyrene Middle School and TGS this year, warrant \n3  issuance of a mandatory prohibitory injunction to preserve the status quo. \n4  138. The purpose of a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order is to \n5  preserve the status quo if the balance of equities so heavily favors the moving party that \n6  justice requires the court to intervene to secure the positions until the merits of the action \n7  are ultimately determined. University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  \n8  139.  A party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that: (1) they are likely \n9  to succeed on the merits of their claims; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \n10  absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an \n11  injunction is in the public interest.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, \n12  1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n13  140. When the government is a party, the third and fourth factors merge.  Nken v. \n14  Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009); Porretti v. Dzurenda, 11 F.4th 1037, 1050 (9th Cir. \n15  2021).  \n16  A.  Likelihood of success on the merits. \n17  Equal Protection Clause Claim \n18  141. There is a strong presumption that gender classifications are invalid and the \n19  burden rests on the state to justify the classification. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. This burden \n20  tracks for purposes of considering the likelihood of the merits of the Plaintiffs’ claim. \n21  Defendants must show that it is “more likely than not” that the Act is constitutional. \n22  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao de Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429–30 (2006) \n23  (finding evidentiary equipoise insufficient and issuing a preliminary injunction). \n24  142. The Supreme Court has addressed the Defendants’ concern that legislation \n25  must be written for the population generally, therefore, “most legislation classifies for one \n26  purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons.”  Hecox, 479 \n27  F. Supp. 3d at 972); (Preliminary Injunction, Oral Argument: July 10, 2023). There are \n28 \n \n- 25 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 26 of 35\n \n \n \n1 \nthree tiers of judicial scrutiny depending on the characteristics of the disadvantaged group \n2 \nor the rights implicated by the classification. Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 972. \n3 \n143. When the state restricts an individual’s access to a fundamental right, the policy \n4 \nmust withstand the strictest of scrutiny. San Antonio Indep. Sch. District. v. Rodriguez, 411 \n5 \nU.S. 1, 16-17 (1973). Access to interscholastic sports is not a constitutionally recognized \n6 \nfundamental right. Walsh v. La High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 616 F.2d 152, 159-60 (5th Cir. \n7 \n1980). Strict scrutiny also applies if a government policy discriminates against a suspect \n8 \nclass  such  as  race,  alienage,  and  national  origin  because  government  policies  that \n9 \ndiscriminate based on race or national origin typically reflect prejudice.  City of Cleburn v. \n10 \nCleburn Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985). \n11 \n144. The least stringent level of scrutiny is rational basis review, which is applied \n12 \nto laws that impose a difference in treatment between groups but do not infringe upon a \n13 \nfundamental right or target a suspect or quasi-suspect class. Heller v. Dow, 509 U.S. 312, \n14 \n319-321 (1993). \n15 \n145.  Heightened  scrutiny  is  an  intermediate  scrutiny,  a  slightly  less  stringent \n16 \nstandard than strict scrutiny, but greater than rational basis review. Craig v. Boren, 429 \n17 \nU.S. 190, 197 (1976); Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. Heightened scrutiny applies to statutes \n18 \nthat discriminate on the basis of sex, a quasi-suspect classification. “‘The purpose of this \n19 \nheightened level of scrutiny is to ensure quasi-suspect classifications do not perpetuate \n20 \nunfounded stereotypes or second-class treatment.’” Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 973 (quoting \n21 \nLatta v. Otter (Latta I), 19 F. Supp. 3d 1054, 1073 (D. Idaho), aff'd, 771 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. \n22 \n2014) (citing Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533)). To withstand heightened scrutiny, a classification \n23 \nby sex “must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to \n24 \nachievement of those objectives.” Craig, 429 U.S. at 197.  \n25 \n146. Laws that discriminate against transgender people are sex-based classifications \n26 \nand, as such, warrant heightened scrutiny.  See Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1200–\n27 \n01 (9th Cir. 2019) (analyzing a policy barring transgender people from military service as \n28 \nsex-based discrimination and applying heightened scrutiny); see also D.T. v. Christ, 552 F. \n \n- 26 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 27 of 35\n \n \n \n1  Supp.  3d  888,  896  (D.  Ariz.  2021)  (“Discrimination  against  transgender  people  is \n2  discrimination based on sex; as such, heightened scrutiny applies.”).  \n3  147. Defendant Horne’s and Intervenors’ argument that the Act does not mention \n4  transgender girls and, therefore, does not discriminate based on transgender status or \n5  gender identity fails.  The Act’s disparate treatment of transgender girls because they are \n6  transgender is clear on the face of the statute and makes it facially discriminatory even if \n7  the statute does not expressly employ the term “transgender”.  See e.g. Hecox, 479 F. Supp. \n8  3d at 975 (rejecting defendants’ argument that similar Idaho statute “does not ban athletes \n9  on the basis of transgender status, but rather on the basis of the innate physiological \n10  advantages males generally have over females”); A.M., 617 F. Supp. 3d at 965–66 (holding \n11  that a virtually identical Indiana statute discriminated against transgender individuals \n12  despite not using the term “transgender”); B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., 550 F. Supp. \n13  3d 347, 353–54 (S.D. W. Va. 2021) (holding that a virtually identical West Virginia statute \n14  “discriminates on the basis of transgender status”), B. P. J. v. W. Virginia State Bd. Of \n15  Educ., No. 2:21-CV-00316, 2023 WL 111875, at *6 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 5, 2023) (cleaned \n16  up), stayed pending appeal B.P.J. v. W. Virginia State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078, 2023 \n17  WL 2803113, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 22, 2023). \n18  148.  The  Arizona  legislature  intentionally  created  a  classification,  specifically \n19  “biological girls,” that necessarily excludes transgender girls, and expressly allowed only \n20  that exclusive classification to play girls sports to the exclusion of transgender girls.  \n21  149. The legislative history demonstrates that the purpose of the Act is to exclude \n22  transgender girls from girls’ sports teams.  Therefore, the Court applies heightened scrutiny \n23  to the Act, does not make a presumption of constitutionality, and does not defer to \n24  legislative judgment. SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories, 740 F.3d 471, \n25  483 (9th Cir. 2014).  \n26  150. Plaintiffs Jane and Megan are transgender girls, members of a quasi-protected \n27  class. The Court applies heightened scrutiny in this case, placing the burden on the \n28  government  to  show  “an  exceedingly  persuasive  justification”  for  the  alleged \n \n- 27 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 28 of 35\n \n \n \n1  discriminatory  treatment,  Virginia,  518  U.S.  at  531,  which  must  not  be  based  on \n2  “generalizations” or “stereotypes,” id. at 549–50, 565.  “The justification ‘must be genuine, \n3  not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation,’ and ‘must not rely on \n4  overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males \n5  and females.”  Karnoski, 926 F.3d at 1200 (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533). \n6  151. In applying heightened scrutiny review, the Court must examine the Act’s \n7  “‘actual purposes and carefully consider any resulting inequality to ensure that our most \n8  fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class \n9  status.’” Latta II, 771 F.3d at 468 (quoting SmithKline, 740 F.3d at 483).  \n10  152. According to Defendants, the Act is to protect girls from physical injury in \n11  sports and promote equality and equity in athletic opportunities, which are, in addition to  \n12  redressing  past  discrimination  against  women  in  athletics,  considered  legitimate  and \n13  important governmental interests justifying rules excluding males from participating on \n14  female teams. Clark, 695 F.2d at 1131.  \n15  153. However, the well-established scientific consensus is that, before puberty, \n16  there are no significant physiological differences in athletic performance between boys and \n17  girls.  Instead, there is overlap between the sexes, with some boys being better athletically \n18  than some girls and some girls outplaying some boys. There is also no evidence that \n19  transgender girls who do not undergo male puberty because they have taken puberty \n20  suppressing medication at the onset of male puberty have an athletic advantage over other \n21  girls.  There are no studies that have documented any such advantage, and there is no \n22  medical reason to posit that any such advantage would exist.  (Id. ¶ 26.)   \n23  154. The testimony by Drs. Brown and Hilton that boys have some biological \n24  advantages related to physical fitness before puberty does not support a conclusion that \n25  Plaintiffs, who have not experienced male puberty, have any athletic advantage over other \n26  girls or pose a safety risk to other girls by playing on girls’ sports teams.  \n27  155. Defendant Horne and Intervenors discuss Clark, 695 F.2d at 1131, throughout \n28  their briefs but Clark strongly supports Plaintiffs.  In Clark, the Ninth Circuit held that it \n \n- 28 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 29 of 35\n \n \n \n1  was  lawful  to  exclude  boys  from  girls’  volleyball  teams  because:  (1)  women  had \n2  historically been deprived of athletic opportunities in favor of men; (2) as a general matter, \n3  men  had  equal  athletic  opportunities  compared  to  women;  and  (3)  according  to  the \n4  stipulated facts in the case, average physiological differences meant that males would \n5  displace females to a substantial extent if permitted to play on women’s volleyball teams.  \n6  Hecox, 479 F.Supp. 3d at 1131. \n7  156. None of the Clark premises hold true for girls who are transgender: (1) far from \n8  being  favored  in  athletics,  “women  who  are  transgender  have  historically  been \n9  discriminated against;” (2) transgender women—unlike the boys in Clark—would not be \n10  able to participate in any school sports; and (3) based on the very small numbers of \n11  transgender girls in the population, “transgender women have not and could not ‘displace’ \n12  cisgender women in athletics ‘to a substantial extent.’”  Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977 \n13  (quoting Clark, 695 F.2d at 1131).  Hecox’s analysis of Clark is more compelling here, \n14  where Plaintiffs have not experienced male puberty and will experience female puberty.  \n15  See Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 981 (transgender girls who do not experience male puberty \n16  “do not have an ascertainable advantage over cisgender female athletes”). \n17  157. Under Clark, the legislature need not pick the wisest alternative for addressing \n18  a problem, but it must show that the policy is “substantially related to the goals of providing \n19  fair and equal playing opportunities for girls and protections to ensure the safety of girls \n20  playing sports. Clark, 695 F.2d at 1132. \n21  158.  The  Court  finds  that  Defendant  Horne  and  Intervenors  fail  to  produce \n22  persuasive evidence at the preliminary injunction stage to show that the Act is substantially \n23  related to the legitimate goals of ensuring equal opportunities for girls to play sports and to \n24  prevent safety risks: \n \n25  -  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  transgender  girls  who  have  not \nexperienced  male  puberty,  have  presented  an  actual  problem  of  unfair \n26  competition or created safety risks to other girls.  \n \n27  -  There is no empirical evidence in the record that transgender girls who have not \nexperienced puberty, have any physiological advantages over other girls that \n28  create unfair competition for positions on girls’ sports teams and other athletic \nopportunities, or pose a safety risk to other girls.  \n \n- 29 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 30 of 35\n \n \n \n1   \n-  The Act is overly broad, reaching sports at all grade levels, including grades \n2  when  athletes  are  prepuberty;  it  bans  transgender  girls,  who  have  not \nexperienced male puberty and who, instead, will or have experienced female \n3  puberty. “The Supreme Court has long viewed with suspicion laws that rely on \noverbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences \n4  of males and females.” B. P. J. 2023 WL 111875, at *6. Laws that discriminate \nbased on sex must be backed by an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” \n5  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 531. \n \n6  -  The Act treats transgender boys and transgender girls and boys’ and girls’ sports \ndifferently. Transgender boys who, according to Defendants’ reasoning and \n7  classifications are “biological girls”, are allowed to play on boys’ sports teams, \nsubject to the alleged risks of that association which the Act proports to address. \n8  The Act creates a private cause of action that burdens only girls’ sports programs \nwith transgender challenges, investigations, and litigation. The Act subjects only \n9  female  athletes,  transgender  and  otherwise,  to  gender  challenges  and \ninvestigations. Boys playing on boys’ teams do not have to worry about any \n10  gender challenge or investigation.  \n \n11 \n159.  Defendant  Horne  and  Intervenors  have  not  established  that  categorically \n12 \nbanning all transgender girls from playing girls’ sports is substantially related  to an \n13 \nimportant government interest.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 524. \n14 \n160. Defendant Horne’s and Intervenors’ argument that the Act is necessary to \n15 \nprotect girls’ sports by barring transgender girls, who purportedly have an unfair athletic \n16 \nadvantage over other girls and/or pose a safety risk to other girls, is based on overbroad \n17 \ngeneralizations and stereotypes that erroneously equate transgender status with athletic \n18 \nability.  See Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 982 (holding that the asserted advantage between \n19 \ntransgender and non-transgender female athletes “is based on overbroad generalizations \n20 \nwithout factual justification”).  Therefore, the Act  does not withstand heightened scrutiny.  \n21 \nKarnoski, 926 F.3d at 1200 (citing Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533). \n22 \n161. Because the Court’s findings of fact reflect that the Act’s categorical bar \n23 \nagainst transgender girls’ participation on girls’ sports teams is not a genuine justification, \n24 \nthe Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits. Heightened scrutiny requires more than a \n25 \nhypothesized problem. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \n26 \n162.  In fact, the Act fails even under the rational basis test because it is not related \n27 \nto  any  important  government  interest.  “[I]f  the  constitutional  conception  of  ‘equal \n28 \nprotection  of  the  laws'  means  anything,  it  must  at  the  very  least  mean  that  a  bare \n \n- 30 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 31 of 35\n \n \n \n1  congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate \n2  governmental interest.” United States Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973). \n3  Title IX Claim \n4  163. Title IX provides, in relevant part, that no person “shall, on the basis of sex, be \n5  excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \n6  under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]” 20 \n7  U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n8  164. Defendants Kyrene School District (administered and overseen by Defendant \n9  Toenjes) and the AIA receive federal financial assistance, and Defendant Horne is a grant \n10  recipient of federal funds. All Defendants must comply with Title IX’s requirements.  (See \n11  Compl. ¶¶ 9–13.)8   \n12  165. Discriminating against an individual on the basis of transgender status is \n13  discrimination based on sex.  See Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741 (2020) \n14  (“[I]t is impossible to discriminate against a person for being . . . transgender without \n15  discriminating against that individual based on sex.”). \n16  166. The Ninth Circuit has held that discrimination based on transgender status also \n17  constitutes impermissible discrimination under Title IX.  See Grabowski v. Ariz. Bd. of \n18  Regents, 69 F.4th 1110, 1116 (9th Cir. 2023) (holding that Bostock Title VII case applies \n19  to Title IX); Doe v. Snyder, 28 F.4th 103, 114 (9th Cir. 2022). \n20  167. The Act discriminates against Plaintiffs based on their status as transgender \n21  girls by providing that for purposes of school sports a student’s sex is fixed “at birth.”  S.B. \n22  1165, 55th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2002), § 2.  \n23  168. The Act’s classification of all transgender girls as male and its prohibition of \n24  students  who  are  “male”  from  playing  on  girls’  teams,  Ariz.  Stat.  §  15-120.02(B), \n25  intentionally excludes all transgender girls, including Plaintiffs, from participating on girls’ \n26  teams.   \n \n27  8 TGS has filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that it does not receive federal financial \nassistance and therefore is not required to comply with Title IX requirements.  The Court \n28 \nwill address this motion by separate order.   \n \n \n- 31 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 32 of 35\n \n \n \n1  169. Exclusion from athletics on the basis of sex is a cognizable harm under Title \n2  IX because it deprives Plaintiffs of the benefits of sports programs and activities that their \n3  non-transgender classmates enjoy.  See Grabowski, 69 F.4th 1121–22 (holding that being \n4  removed from the team was an adverse action under Title IX); see also A.M. by E.M. v. \n5  Indianapolis Pub. Sch., 617 F. Supp. 3d 950 (S.D. Ind. 2022), appeal dismissed sub nom. \n6  A.M. by E.M. v. Indianapolis Pub. Sch. & Superintendent, No. 22-2332, 2023 WL 371646 \n7  (7th Cir. Jan. 19, 2023) (granting a preliminary injunction of a similar Indiana law that \n8  banned transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams based on Title IX). \n9  170.  The  Court  rejects  Defendant  Horne’s  and  Intervenors’  arguments  that \n10  Plaintiffs’ schools offer teams for both boys and girls and, therefore, Plaintiffs are not \n11  excluded from participating in sports on teams consistent with their “biological sex.” The \n12  Court’s findings of fact reflect that Plaintiffs, who are transgender girls, cannot play on \n13  boys’ teams because they are transgender girls who have not and will not go through male \n14  puberty and will go through female puberty. Moreover, playing on a boys’ team would be \n15  shameful and humiliating for Plaintiffs as well as in direct conflict with ongoing treatment \n16  for gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition.   \n17  B.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if Relief Is Not Granted. \n18  171. Plaintiffs face irreparable harm if this Court does not enjoin the Act as to them.  \n19  172. Enforcement of the Act in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in and of \n20  itself  is  sufficient  to  presume  irreparable  harm  to  justify  a  preliminary  injunction.  \n21  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994–95 (9th Cir. 2017) (“It is well established that \n22  the deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”) \n23  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 987 (noting this \n24  “dispositive presumption”). \n25  173. A violation of Title IX also causes irreparable harm.  See Anders v. Cal. State \n26  Univ., Fresno, 2021 WL 1564448, at *18 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2021) (finding irreparable \n27  harm under Title IX given the “presumption of irreparable injury where plaintiff shows \n28  violation of a civil rights statute” and in light of “the insult that comes from unequal \n \n- 32 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 33 of 35\n \n \n \n1  treatment”); Portz v. St. Cloud State Univ., 196 F. Supp. 3d 963, 973 (D. Minn. 2016) \n2  (“Plaintiffs have a fair chance of succeeding on their Title IX claim, and Congress passed \n3  Title  IX  pursuant  to  its  power  to  enforce  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.    Plaintiffs’ \n4  expectation that they may be treated unequally in violation of Title IX’s terms is an \n5  irreparable harm.”) (cleaned up).  \n6  174.  Plaintiffs  will  also  suffer  severe  and  irreparable  mental,  physical,  and \n7  emotional harm if the Act applies to them because they cannot play on boys’ sports teams. \n8  Playing on a boys’ team would directly contradict Plaintiffs’ medical treatment for gender \n9  dysphoria and would be painful and humiliating.  Plaintiffs’ mental health is dependent on \n10  living as girls in all aspects of their lives.   \n11  175. Enforcing the Act against Plaintiffs will effectively exclude Plaintiffs from \n12  school sports and deprive them of the social, educational, physical, and emotional health \n13  benefits  that  both  sides  acknowledge  come  from  school  sports.  This  exclusion  is  a \n14  cognizable harm.  Grabowski, 69 F.4th at 1121. \n15  176.  Plaintiffs  will  also  suffer  the  shame  and  humiliation  of  being  unable  to \n16  participate  in  a  school  activity  simply  because  they  are  transgender—a  personal \n17  characteristic over which they have no control.  Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 \n18  F.3d 586, 625 (4th Cir. 2020) (explaining that the stigma of exclusion “publicly brand[s] \n19  all transgender students with a scarlet ‘T’”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n20  177. In addition, Plaintiffs will suffer the cognizable and irreparable “dignitary \n21  wounds” associated with the passage of a law expressly designed to communicate the \n22  state’s moral disapproval of their identity, wounds that “cannot always be healed with the \n23  stroke of a pen.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 678 (2015); Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d \n24  at 987 (finding such wounds constitute irreparable harm). \n25  178. Plaintiffs have established that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Act is \n26  enforced against them.  \n27  C.  The Public Interest and Balance of Equities Favor Injunctive Relief. \n28  179. When an injunction is sought against a governmental entity, the public interest \n \n- 33 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 34 of 35\n \n \n \n1  and balance-of-the-hardships factors merge.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435–36.  \n2  180. As an initial matter, “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation \n3  of a party’s constitutional rights.”  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n4  2012). \n5  181.  The  balance  of  equities  favors  Plaintiffs  as  well.    Defendant  Horne  and \n6  Intervenors “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  \n7  Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013).  Plaintiffs, however, face \n8  serious and ongoing harm if the Act is enforced against them.   \n9  182. The alleged harm to Defendants and Intervenors—“that biological girls will be \n10  forced to compete against transgender girls who allegedly have an athletic advantage”—is \n11  unsupported by the record.  A.M., 617 F. Supp. 3d at 968.   Moreover, there is no evidence \n12  in the record  “that allowing [Plaintiffs] to play on the girls’ [teams] will make this \n13  [purported] harm a reality.”  Id.  On the contrary, the record suggests the opposite.  Based \n14  on the record for the preliminary injunction, the Court has found that Plaintiffs do not have \n15  a competitive advantage over other girls, and they do not pose a safety risk.  \n16  183. But for the Act, Defendants TGS, Kyrene School District, Superintendent \n17  Toenjes, and the AIA would all permit Plaintiffs to play on girls’ teams.   \n18  184. There is no evidence that any Defendant will be harmed by allowing Plaintiffs \n19  to continue playing with their peers as they have done until now.  Hecox, 479 F. Supp. 3d \n20  at 988 (“[A] preliminary injunction would not harm Defendants because it would merely \n21  maintain the status quo while Plaintiffs pursue their claims.”). \n22  185. Accordingly, the public interest and balance of equities favor a preliminary \n23  injunction.   \n24  CONCLUSION \n25  The Court’s findings of fact support Plaintiffs’ assertions that very serious damages \n26  will result from a change in the status quo, and as a matter of law and fact, this is not a \n27  doubtful case. See Anderson, 612 F.2d at 1114 (generally, mandatory injunctions require \n28  extreme or very serious damage and not issued in doubtful cases). Because Plaintiffs have \n \n- 34 - \n\n \nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ   Document 127   Filed 07/20/23   Page 35 of 35\n \n \n \n1  satisfied  all  elements  necessary  to  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction,  the  Court  grants \n2  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n3  The Court has the discretion to determine whether the moving party is required to \n4  post a bond as a condition for the granting of a preliminary injunction.  Diaz v. Brewer, \n5  656 F.3d 1008, 1015 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 \n6  (9th Cir. 2009)).  Here, a bond is not required because “there is no realistic likelihood of \n7  harm to the defendant from enjoining his or her conduct.”  Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d \n8  906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003). \n9  Accordingly, \n10  IT  IS  ORDERED  that  the  Motion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  (Doc.  3)  is \n11  GRANTED. \n12  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant Horne is enjoined from enforcing \n13  A.R.S. § 15-120.02 as to Plaintiffs. \n14  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  Act  shall  not  prevent  Plaintiffs  from \n15  participating in girls’ sports and, as agreed by Kyrene School District and Laura Toenjes, \n16  in her official capacity, pursuant to the Stipulation in Lieu of an Answer (Doc. 59), and by \n17  TGS in open Court at the hearing for the Preliminary Injunction, the Plaintiffs shall be \n18  allowed to play girls’ sports at their respective schools. \n19  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the AIA transgender policy, § 41.9, complies \n20  with the terms of this preliminary injunction. \n21    Dated this 20th day of July, 2023. \n22   \n \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 35 - ",

In 2022, Arizona enacted the Save \nWomen’s Sports Act, which prohibits “students of the male \nsex,”  including  transgender  women  and  girls,  from \nparticipating in women’s and girls’ sports.  The complaint \nalleges that the Act’s transgender ban violates, inter alia, the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and \nTitle IX.   Plaintiffs challenge enforcement of the Act solely \nas  applied  to  them.   The  district  court  concluded  that \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal protection \nand Title IX claims, and preliminarily enjoined enforcing the \nAct against them. \nThe panel held that the district court did not clearly err \nby  finding  that,  before  puberty,  there  are  no  significant \ndifferences in athletic performance between boys and girls; \ntreating small differences as insignificant; and finding that \ntransgender girls who receive puberty-blocking medication \ndo not have an athletic advantage over other girls. \n \n** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has \nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 5 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    5 \nThe  panel  affirmed  the  district  court’s  holding  that \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal \nprotection claim.  The district court did not clearly err by \nfinding that the Act was adopted for the discriminatory \npurpose of excluding transgender girls from playing on girls’ \nsports  teams.   Accordingly,  the  district  court  properly \nconcluded that the Act is subject to heightened scrutiny. \nThe  panel  held  that  Arizona’s  transgender  ban \ndiscriminates on its face based on transgender status.  To \nsurvive  heightened  scrutiny,  a  classification  must  serve \nimportant governmental objectives and must be substantially \nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.  The panel \nheld that, given the district court’s well-supported factual \nfindings,  the  district  court  properly  concluded  that \nAppellants—the State Superintendent of Public Instruction \nand several legislators—are unlikely to establish that the \nAct’s sweeping transgender ban is substantially related to the \nachievement  of  the  State’s  important  governmental \nobjectives in ensuring competitive fairness and equal athletic \nopportunity  for  female  student-athletes.   The  Act’s \ntransgender ban applies not only to all transgender women \nand girls in Arizona, regardless of circulating testosterone \nlevels or other medically accepted indicia of competitive \nadvantage, but also to all sports, regardless of the physical \ncontact involved, the type or level of competition, or the age \nor grade of the participants.  The district court therefore did \nnot err by concluding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their equal protection claim.  Because Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection \nclaim, the panel did not reach the issue of whether Plaintiffs \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX claim as \nwell. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 6 of 55\n6  DOE V. HORNE \nThe panel held that the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion  in  addressing  the  remaining  preliminary \ninjunction factors—the likeliness of irreparable harm in the \nabsence of relief, the balance of the equities, and the public \ninterest.  Accordingly, the panel held that the district court \ndid not abuse its discretion by granting Plaintiffs’ motion for \na narrow preliminary injunction. \n \n \nCOUNSEL \nJustin R.

Given  our \nlimited and deferential review and the district court’s well-\nsupported  factual  findings,  including  its  finding  that \n“[t]ransgender girls who have not undergone male puberty \ndo not have an athletic advantage over other girls,” Doe v. \nHorne, 683 F.

For a transgender \nperson, however, “that initial designation does not match the \nperson’s gender identity.”  Id.

Subsection A requires schools to classify sports and \nstudents  by  “biological  sex,”  and  Subsection  B  bans \n“students of the male sex” from female-designated sports.  \nThe Act does not define “biological sex,” but the parties \nagree that the term is synonymous with sex assigned at birth.  \nSee Doe, 683 F.

HORNE    17 \ncisgender male students and transgender female students, the \nAct in fact has no effect on the ability of cisgender men and \nboys to engage in female sports, because they were already \nexcluded from female sports under the pre-Act status quo.  \nSee, e.g., Clark ex rel. Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass’n \n(Clark I), 695 F.2d 1126, 1127 (9th Cir. 1982) (upholding an \nArizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) policy precluding \ncisgender boys from playing on girls’ teams); Clark ex rel. \nClark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass’n (Clark II), 886 F.2d \n1191, 1192, 1194 (9th Cir. 1989) (same).  But the Act has a \nprofound impact on transgender women and girls.  Under \nArizona’s pre-Act status quo, transgender women and girls \nin grade school, high school, and college were permitted to \nparticipate in women’s and girls’ sports, albeit under limited \ncircumstances, consistent with policies established by the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the AIA, \nand individual schools.  Under current NCAA policy, for \nexample, transgender women are permitted to compete in \nwomen’s sports when they meet sport-specific standards for \ndocumented testosterone levels.  See Transgender Student-\nAthlete  Participation  Policy,  NCAA  (May  2024), \nhttps://www.ncaa.org/sports/2022/1/27/transgender-\nparticipation-policy.aspx (last visited Aug. 27, 2024).  Under \nAIA policy, which states that “students should have the \nopportunity to participate in [AIA] activities in a manner that \nis consistent with their gender identity,” transgender female \nstudents were permitted to play on girls’ teams when a \ncommittee of experts found “that the student’s request is \nappropriate and is not motivated by an improper purpose and \nthere are no adverse health risks to the athlete.”  AIA, AIA \nPolicies & Procedures, art. 41, § 41.9 ( 2022-23).3  The AIA \n \n3 The AIA is a voluntary association of public and private high schools.  \nIn the dozen or so years before the Act’s passage, the AIA fielded \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 18 of 55\n18  DOE V. HORNE \npolicy also permitted each school district to set its own rules \ngoverning  transgender  students’  participation  in \nintramural—i.e., non-interscholastic—sports.  Doe, 683 F. \nSupp. 3d at 960. \nThe  Act  abrogates  these  policies  by  categorically \nbanning transgender women and girls from women’s and \ngirls’ sports.  As the district court explained, “[u]nlike the \nprior case-by-case basis used to approve a transgender girl’s \nrequest to play on a team consistent with her gender identity, \nwhich  considered  among  other  things  the  age  and \ncompetitive  level  relevant  to  the  request,  the  Act \ncategorically bans all transgender girls’ participation.”  Id. at \n962. \nThe  Act’s  sweeping  transgender  ban  admits  of  no \nexceptions.    The  ban  applies  to  all  transgender  female \nstudents, from kindergarten through graduate school; and for \nall sports, including intramural games, regardless of whether \nphysical contact is involved.  Significantly, the ban turns \nentirely on a student’s transgender or cisgender status, and \nnot  at  all  on  factors—such  as  levels  of  circulating \ntestosterone—that the district court found bear a genuine \nrelationship  to  athletic  performance  and  competitive \nadvantage.    The  ban  thus  applies  to  many  transgender \nwomen  and  girls  who,  according  to  the  district  court’s \nfindings,  lack  an  athletic  or  competitive  advantage  over \ncisgender  women  and  girls,  including,  for  example: \ntransgender girls such as kindergartners who are too young \nto have gone through male puberty; transgender women and \n \napproximately 12 requests from transgender students seeking to play on \nteams consistent with their gender identities and approved seven of those \nrequests.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 961. The record does not reveal \nwhether these students were transgender boys or transgender girls.

After passage of the \nAct,  Arizona  allows  other  students—including  cisgender \nwomen and girls, cisgender men and boys, and transgender \nmen and boys—to play on teams corresponding with their \ngender identities; only transgender women  and girls are \nbarred from doing so.4 \nThe Act also singles out women’s and girls’ athletics for \nunfavorable treatment.  As the district court explained, “[t]he \nAct’s creation of a private cause of action against a school \nfor any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or \nsuffers any harm, whether direct or indirect, related to a \nschool[’s] failure to preclude participation of a transgender \ngirl on a girls’ team places an onerous burden on girls’ sports \nprograms, not faced by boys’ athletic programs.”  Id. at 963.  \n \n4 That the Act allows transgender men and boys to play on men’s and \nboys’ teams does not preclude a finding that the Act discriminates based \non transgender status.  As we explained in Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1079, \n“a law is not immune to an equal protection challenge if it discriminates \nonly against some members of a protected class but not others.”  See, \ne.g., Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 516–17 (2000) (“Simply because a \nclass defined by ancestry does not include all members of the race does \nnot suffice to make the classification race neutral.”); Nyquist v. Mauclet, \n432 U.S. 1, 9 (1977) (“The fact that the statute is not an absolute bar does \nnot mean that it does not discriminate against the class.”); Mathews v. \nLucas,  427  U.S.  495,  504–05  n.11  (1976)  (“That  the  statutory \nclassifications challenged here discriminate among illegitimate children \ndoes not mean, of course, that they are not also properly described as \ndiscriminating between legitimate and illegitimate children.”). \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 20 of 55\n20  DOE V.

Plaintiffs are transgender girls who have not gone \nthrough male puberty and wish to play girls’ sports at their \nArizona schools. \nJane is an 11-year-old transgender girl who attends the \nKyrene Aprende Middle School, a public school located in \nChandler, Arizona, near Phoenix.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at \n958.  She has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life since she \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 22 of 55\n22  DOE V.

She has changed her name through a court \norder to a more traditional female name, and she has a female \ngender marker on her passport.  Id. at 958–59.  Jane began \nreceiving  Supprelin,  a  puberty-blocking  medication,  in \n2023, at age 11.  Id. at 959.  The district court found that Jane \nwill not experience any of the physiological changes that \nincreased testosterone levels would cause in a pubescent \nboy.  Id. \nSports are important to Jane, and she has played soccer \nfor many years.  Id.  Aside from its physical and emotional \nhealth benefits, soccer has helped Jane make new friends and \nconnect  with  other  girls,  and  Jane’s  teachers,  coaches, \nfriends, and  members of her soccer team have all been \nsupportive of her gender identity.  Id.  At Aprende, Jane \nplays (or is interested in playing) on the girls’ soccer, girls’ \nbasketball, and coed cross-country teams.5  Id.  Aprende, \nwhich participates in the AIA, has no objection to Jane \nplaying on girls’ teams.  Id. \nMegan is a 15-year-old transgender girl attending the \nGregory School, a private school in Tucson.  Id.  Megan has \nalways known she is a girl, has lived as a girl in all aspects \nof her life since she was seven, and was diagnosed with \ngender dysphoria at age 10.  Id. at 959–60.  Through a court \norder, Megan has changed her name to a more traditional \nfemale name and her gender to female, and she has a female \ngender marker on her passport.  Id. at 960.6  Megan has been \n \n5 Boys and girls train together but compete separately on the coed cross-\ncountry team.  Doe, 683 F.

As a result of these \ntreatments,  the  district  court  found  that  Megan  has  not \nexperienced  the  physiological  changes  that  increased \ntestosterone levels would cause in a pubescent boy.  Id.  On \nthe contrary, the district court found that she has developed \nmany of the physiological changes associated with female \npuberty.  Id. \nAs  with  Jane,  sports  have  figured  prominently  in \nMegan’s life.  Id.  When she was about seven, Megan joined \na swim team, and the coach of the swim team was supportive \nof her and her gender identity.  Id.  At the Gregory School, \nMegan is a member of the girls’ volleyball team, although \nthe Act has barred her from competing in interscholastic \ngames.  Id. at 960, 962.  Her teammates, coaches, and school \nare all highly supportive of her and have welcomed her \nparticipation on the team.  Id. at 960.  Like Kyrene Aprende \nMiddle School, the Gregory School participates in the AIA. \nThe complaint alleges that the Act’s transgender ban \nviolates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; Title IX of the \nEducation  Amendments  of  1972,  20  U.S.C.  § 1681;  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 \net seq.; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \nThe complaint names five defendants: Thomas C. Horne, in \nhis  official  capacity  as  State  Superintendent  of  Public \nInstruction;  Laura  Toenjes,  in  her  official  capacity  as \nSuperintendent of the Kyrene School District; the Kyrene \nSchool  District;  the  Gregory  School;  and  the  AIA.    In \naddition, Warren Petersen, President of the Arizona State \n \nher personal, vital, medical, financial, educational, and other public \ndocuments. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 24 of 55\n24  DOE V. HORNE \nSenate, and Ben Toma, Speaker of the Arizona House of \nRepresentatives  (the  “Legislators”),  have  intervened  as \ndefendants. \nPlaintiffs  neither  challenge  the  existence  of  separate \nteams for girls and boys nor challenge the Act facially.  \nRather, they challenge enforcement of the Act solely as \napplied to them.  They seek injunctive and declaratory relief \nin the form of an order allowing them to participate in their \nchosen sports. \nD. \nContemporaneous  with  the  filing  of  the  complaint, \nPlaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the defendants from \nenforcing the Act as applied to them.  Plaintiffs sought relief \non the grounds that they were likely to succeed on their equal \nprotection  and  Title  IX  claims.    In  July  2023,  after \nconsidering the parties’ briefs, evidentiary submissions from \nnumerous experts, and argument presented at a hearing, the \ndistrict court granted the motion.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at \n955–77.  The preliminary injunction order includes a number \nof factual findings relevant to this appeal.  The district court \nfound  that  “[t]he  Act  was  adopted  for  the  purpose  of \nexcluding transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports \nteams.”  Id. at 963.  The district court also found that, \n“[b]efore puberty, there are no significant differences in \nathletic performance between boys and girls.”  Id. at 968.  \nThe court acknowledged studies showing that prepubertal \nboys outperform prepubertal girls on school physical fitness \ntests, but the court found “no basis . . . to attribute those \nsmall differences to physiology or anatomy instead of to \nother  factors  such  as  greater  societal  encouragement  of \nathleticism in boys, greater opportunities for boys to play \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 25 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    25 \nsports, or differences in the preferences of the boys and girls \nsurveyed.”  Id. at 966. \nThe district court also found that “[t]he biological driver \nof  average  group  differences  in  athletic  performance \nbetween adolescent boys and girls is the difference in their \nrespective levels of testosterone, which only begin to diverge \nsignificantly after the onset of puberty,” and that puberty \ntypically  begins  at  around  age  12.    Id.  at  968.    More \nspecifically, the court cited “the scientific consensus that the \nbiological  cause  of  average  differences  in  athletic \nperformance between men and women is . . . the presence of \ncirculating  levels  of  testosterone  beginning  with  male \npuberty . . . between the ages of about 12 and 18.”  Id. at \n964–65.  Accordingly, the court found that transgender girls \nsuch as Plaintiffs, who begin puberty-blocking medication \nand hormone therapy at an early age, “do not have an athletic \nadvantage over other girls.”  Id. at 964.  The court found that \n“[t]ransgender  girls  who  receive  puberty-blocking \nmedication do not have an athletic advantage over other girls \nbecause  they  do  not  undergo  male  puberty  and  do  not \nexperience  the  physiological  changes  caused  by  the \nincreased production of testosterone associated with male \npuberty.”  Id. at 968.  It also found that “[t]ransgender girls \nwho  receive  hormone  therapy  after  receiving  puberty-\nblocking medication will develop the skeletal structure, fat \ndistribution, and muscle and breast development typical of \nother girls” and  “will typically have the same levels of \ncirculating estrogen and testosterone as other girls.”  Id.  \nFinally, the district court found that “transgender girls who \nhave not yet undergone male puberty or who have received \npuberty-blocking medication at the onset of puberty do not \npresent any unique safety risk to other girls.”  Id. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 26 of 55\n26  DOE V. HORNE \nOn  the  strength  of  these  findings,  the  district  court \nconcluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their \nequal protection challenge to the transgender ban.  As a \nthreshold  matter,  the  court  concluded  that  heightened \nscrutiny  applies  because  the  Act  discriminates  against \ntransgender girls both purposely and on its face.  Id. at 971–\n72.  Applying heightened scrutiny, the court concluded that \nHorne and the Legislators—the only defendants actively \ndefending the ban—failed to “establish[] that categorically \nbanning all transgender girls from playing girls’ sports is \nsubstantially related to an important government interest.”  \nId. at 973.  The court concluded that their “argument that the \nAct  is  necessary  to  protect  girls’  sports  by  barring \ntransgender girls, who purportedly have an unfair athletic \nadvantage over other girls and/or pose a safety risk to other \ngirls, is based on overbroad generalizations and stereotypes \nthat  erroneously  equate  transgender  status  with  athletic \nability.”  Id. at 973–74. \nThe district court also determined that Plaintiffs were \nlikely to succeed on their Title IX claim, that Plaintiffs \nwould suffer irreparable harm if relief were not granted, and \nthat the public interest and the balance of the equities favored \nrelief.    Id.  at  974–76.    Accordingly,  the  court  granted \nPlaintiffs motion and preliminarily enjoined Horne from \nenforcing the Act against Plaintiffs.  Id. at 977.  Horne and \nthe Legislators (collectively, “Appellants”) filed separate \ntimely appeals that we subsequently consolidated. \nII. \n“The ‘purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve \nthe status quo ante litem pending a determination of the \naction on the merits.’”  Boardman v.

But  “[a]  preliminary  injunction  is  an \nextraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24. \n“We  review  the  grant  or  denial  of  a  preliminary \ninjunction for abuse of discretion.”  Johnson, 572 F.3d at \n1078 (quoting Am.

Specifically,  Appellants \nargue that the district court clearly erred by: (1) finding that, \nbefore puberty, there are no significant differences in athletic \nperformance  between  boys  and  girls;  (2) treating  small \ndifferences as insignificant; and (3) finding that transgender \ngirls who receive puberty-blocking medication do not have \nan athletic advantage over other girls.  We sustain these \nfindings  because  they  are  not  “illogical,  implausible,  or \nwithout support in inferences that may be drawn from the \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 29 of 55\n  DOE V.

Appellants have not shown that the \ndistrict court clearly erred. \nA. \nThe district court’s finding that, “[b]efore puberty, there \nare  no  significant  differences  in  athletic  performance \nbetween boys and girls,” Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 968, is not \nclearly  erroneous.

He acknowledged that “some \nstudies  have  found  small  differences  between  the \nperformance of boys and girls with respect to some discrete \nactivities,” but he noted that “these studies did not control \nfor  other  factors,  particularly  age,  location,  or \nsocioeconomic factors.”  Rebuttal Decl. of Daniel Shumer, \nM.D.,  ¶ 10.    He  further  explained,  “When  research  has \ncontrolled for those factors by using representative data, \nresearchers have found . . . ‘no statistical difference in the \ncapabilities  of  girls  and  boys  until  high-school  age \n(commonly age 12).’”  Id. ¶ 11.  According to Dr. Shumer, \n“[t]here  is  no  reliable  basis  . . .  to  attribute  those  small \ndifferences  to  physiology  or  anatomy  instead  of  other \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 30 of 55\n30  DOE V.

These \nstudies,  however,  neither  attributed  these  differences  to \nbiological rather than sociological factors nor concluded that \nthese  differences  translated  into  competitive  athletic \nadvantages.    Moreover,  the  results  of  these  studies  are \ndisputed.  Dr. Shumer, for example, testified that studies \nhave found “no statistical difference in the [muscle strength] \nof girls and boys until high-school age” and that height \ndifferences between boys and girls “disappear around age 6 \nto 8 years of age, and do not begin diverging again until \npuberty,” when girls acquire an advantage.  Shumer 2d \nRebuttal Decl. ¶¶  13, 18.  On appeal, Appellants cite the \nfindings of these studies selectively.  For example, although \na  2017  study  found  that  prepubertal  boys  had  greater \nshoulder internal rotator strength than prepubertal girls, the \nstudy also found “no significant . . . differences between \nstrength measures of boys or girls aged 3–9 years” with \nrespect to the 12 other muscle groups studied.

Brown, Ph.D., FACSM, a Professor of \nExercise  Science  in  the  Department  of  Kinesiology  and \nSport Sciences at the University of Nebraska Kearney—\ndisagree with these findings, but our review of a district \ncourt’s factual findings is limited and deferential, especially \nat this stage of the proceedings.  Because the challenged \nfindings are firmly grounded in evidence in the record, they \nare not clearly erroneous. \nB. \nAppellants contend the district court clearly erred by \ntreating small differences between prepubertal boys and girls \nas insignificant.  They note that small differences can “have \nan  enormous  influence  in  competitive  sports,  where \noutcomes are routinely decided by tiny margins.”  Opening \nBr. at 56.  Appellants overlook the court’s finding that the \nsmall differences that have been identified by some studies \nhave not been shown to be attributable to biological rather \nthan sociological factors.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 966.  The \ncourt found that “any prepubertal differences between boys \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 32 of 55\n32  DOE V.

These findings are supported by \nthe record and are not clearly erroneous.7 \nC. \nAppellants  also  take  issue  with  the  district  court’s \nfinding  that  “[t]ransgender  girls  who  receive  puberty-\nblocking medication do not have an athletic advantage over \nother girls because they do not undergo male puberty and do \nnot  experience  the  physiological  changes  caused  by  the \nincreased production of testosterone associated with male \npuberty.”  Id. at 968.  Appellants point to what they describe \nas “abundant evidence showing that preventing male puberty \ndoes not eliminate the advantages that [transgender females] \nhave over [cisgender] females.”  Opening Br. at 52. \nThe district court’s finding is grounded in the record \nevidence.    Dr.  Shumer  testified  that  transgender  girls \nreceiving treatment consistent with current standards of care \nbegin puberty blockers “at the first onset of puberty, . . . long \nbefore  the  development  of  increased  muscle  mass  and \nstrength associated with the later stages of male puberty,” \n \n7 Because Appellants failed to show that there are differences in athletic \nperformance between prepubertal boys and girls that are attributable to \nbiology, the district court had no occasion to address whether slight \ndifferences of that nature would justify a categorical ban on transgender \nwomen and girls playing women’s and girls’ sports.  We likewise \nexpress no opinion on that question. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 33 of 55\n  DOE V.

Consequently, Dr. \nShumer testified that these transgender girls “will develop \nmany  of  the  same  physiological  and  anatomical \ncharacteristics of non-transgender girls, including bone size, \nskeletal structure, and distinctive aspects of the female pelvis \ngeometry that cut against athletic performance. . . .  Because \nsuch girls do not undergo male puberty, they do not gain the \nincreased muscle mass or strength that accounts for why \npost-pubertal boys as a group have an advantage over post-\npubertal  girls  as  a  group.”    Id.  ¶¶ 27–28.    Dr.  Shumer \ntestified, there is “no evidence that transgender girls on \npuberty suppression medication or hormone therapy have an \nathletic advantage over other girls,” there are “no studies that \nhave documented any such advantage,” and there is “no \nmedical  reason  to  posit  that  any  such  advantage  would \nexist.”  Id. ¶ 36; see also Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 14–27.  \nDr. Shumer also cited “the scientific consensus that the \nbiological  cause  of  average  differences  in  athletic \nperformance  between  men  and  women  is  the  rise  of \ncirculating levels of testosterone beginning in endogenous \nmale puberty.”  Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶ 8.  Dr. Shumer \nfurther  testified  that  “a  transgender  girl  who  receives \nhormone  therapy  will  typically  have  the  same  levels  of \ncirculating estrogen and testosterone levels as other girls.”  \nShumer Decl. ¶ 36. \nRelying  on  several  studies,  Appellants  argue  that \ntransgender  females  who  receive  puberty  blockers  have \nadvantages over cisgender females in lean body mass, grip \nstrength, and height.  But Appellants overlook that in these \nstudies, male puberty was only partially blocked.  In the lean \nbody  mass  study,  for  example,  the  transgender  women \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 34 of 55\n34  DOE V.

Sexual \nMed. 251 (2018).  Plaintiffs, by contrast, began receiving \npuberty blockers at age 11.  Similarly, the height study upon \nwhich Appellants rely considered “transgender girls who \nhad received puberty blockers from around 13 years of age” \nand “cross-sex hormones at 16 years of age”—far later than \nPlaintiffs and others following current protocols.

Given  the \nlimited relevance of these studies, the district court did not \nclearly err. \nIV. \nThe district court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on their equal protection and Title IX claims.  We \ndiscuss these claims in turn, beginning with equal protection. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 35 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    35 \nA. \n1. \nIn Karnoski v.

Thus, if the Act discriminates based \non transgender status, either purposefully or on its face, \nheightened scrutiny applies.8 \na. \nA  discriminatory  purpose  is  shown  when  “the \ndecisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or \nreaffirmed  a  particular  course  of  action  at  least  in  part \n‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon \nan identifiable group.”  Pers.

Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 489 (1997) \n(quoting Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).  \n“Other  considerations  relevant  to  the  purpose  inquiry \ninclude, among other things, ‘the historical background of \nthe  [jurisdiction’s]  decision’;  ‘[t]he  specific  sequence  of \nevents leading up to the challenged decision’; ‘[d]epartures \nfrom the normal procedural sequence’; and ‘[t]he legislative \nor administrative history, especially . . .

Although  we  start  with  a \npresumption that a legislature acted in good faith, a plaintiff \nneed  demonstrate  only  that  discrimination  against  a \nprotected class “was a substantial or motivating factor in \nenacting  the  challenged  provision,”  not  the  sole  or \npredominant factor.  United States v. Carrillo-Lopez, 68 \nF.4th 1133, 1139–40 (9th Cir. 2023).  Here, the district court \nfound  that  “[t]he  Act  was  adopted  for  the  purpose  of \nexcluding transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports \nteams.”  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 963.  This finding is not \nclearly erroneous. \nFirst, Appellants’ contention that the legislature adopted \nthe Act to ensure competitive fairness and equal athletic \nopportunities  for  cisgender  female  athletes  cannot  be \nsquared with the fact that the Act bars students from female \nathletics based entirely on transgender status and not at all \nbased on factors the district court found bear a genuine \nconnection  to  athletic  performance  and  competitive \nadvantage, such as circulating testosterone.  The district \ncourt concluded that “[t]he Arizona legislature intentionally \ncreated a classification, specifically ‘biological girls,’ that \nnecessarily excludes transgender girls,” id. at 971, and that \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 37 of 55\n  DOE V.

See Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., 458 \nU.S.  527,  544  (1982)  (“In  determining  whether  . . .  a \n[discriminatory]  purpose  was  the  motivating  factor,  the \nracially disproportionate effect of official action provides \n‘an important starting point.’” (quoting Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n274 (in turn quoting Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 266))).  Here, the Act’s transgender ban affects only \ntransgender  female  students.    To  be  sure,  the  statutory \nlanguage bans all “students of the male sex” from female \nsports.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-120.02(B).  But Appellants \nhave not shown that the Act had any real-world impact on \ncisgender male students, who have long been excluded from \nfemale sports in Arizona and elsewhere.  See Clark I, 695 \nF.2d at 1127; Clark II, 886 F.2d at 1192.9 \nThe Act’s burdens instead fall exclusively on transgender \nwomen and girls.  Under the pre-Act status quo, transgender \nwomen and girls were permitted to participate in women’s \nand  girls’  sports  consistent  with  AIA,  NCAA,  and \n \n9 Appellants contend the Act affects cisgender males because there was \nno state law explicitly barring cisgender males from female sports before \nthe Act’s adoption and because AIA and NCAA policies excluding \ncisgender males from female sports applied only to member schools, not \nto  other  schools,  and  only  to  colleges  and  high  schools,  not  to \nkindergarten through eighth grade.  This argument fails because the Act \nmerely  codifies  preexisting  rules  barring  cisgender  males  from \nparticipating on girls’ sports teams, and it had no practical effect on \ncisgender males. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 38 of 55\n38  DOE V. HORNE \nindividual-school  policies.    The  Act  functions  solely  to \nabrogate those policies, and thus burdens only transgender \nfemale students.  Cf. Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1077 (“[T]he \nAct’s discriminatory purpose is . . . evidenced by the Act’s \nprohibition of ‘biological males’ from female-designated \nteams because that prohibition affects one group of athletes \nonly—transgender women. . . .  The Act’s only contribution \nto Idaho’s student-athletic landscape is to entirely exclude \ntransgender women and girls from participating on female \nsports teams.”); B.P.J., 98 F.4th at 556 (applying heightened \nscrutiny where the challenged legislation’s “only effect” was \n“to exclude transgender girls . . . from participation on girls \nsports teams”).10 \nIn sum, the district court did not clearly err by finding a \ndiscriminatory  purpose.    Accordingly,  the  district  court \nproperly concluded that the Act is subject to heightened \nscrutiny on this basis. \nb. \nTurning to facial discrimination, Appellants contend the \nAct “is ‘facially’ neutral with respect to gender identity” \n \n10 The district court also found evidence of discriminatory purpose in the \nlegislative history, noting that Senator Vince Leach explained his vote \nfor the bill by stating, “if we allow transgenders to take over female \nsports,  you  will  not  have  females  participating,”  and  that  Senator \nPetersen, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, questioned \nwhether critics of the bill would “be opposed to having just a trans \nleague, so that they can all compete in their own league.”  Doe, 683 F. \nSupp. 3d at 963.  Speakers at the legislative hearing on the bill also \nreferred to transgender women and girls as “males” and “men.”  See \nHearing on Senate Bill 1165, Arizona State Senate, Committee on the \nJudiciary,  Jan.  20,  2022,  available  at \nhttps://www.azleg.gov/videoplayer/?eventID=2022011057&startStrea\nmAt=508 (last visited Aug. 27, 2024). \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 39 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    39 \nbecause it “describes who may play on what sports teams \n‘without referring to’ gender identity.”  Opening Br. at 32.  \nThey rely on Martin v. International Olympic Committee, \n740 F.2d 670, 678 (9th Cir. 1984), which held that an IOC \nrule  was  gender  neutral  because  it  “describe[d]  the \nprocedures for determining events to be included in the \nOlympic Games without referring to the competitors’ sex.”  \nUnder circuit precedent, however, the Act discriminates on \nits face based on transgender status.   \nIn Latta v. Otter, 771 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2014), we held \nthat state laws defining marriage as between a man and a \nwoman,  but  making  no  mention  of  sexual  orientation, \ndiscriminated on their face based on sexual orientation.  Id. \nat 464 n.2, 467–68.  Although the challenged laws prohibited \nall same-sex couples from marrying, whether gay or straight, \nthe laws facially discriminated based on sexual orientation \nbecause  only  gay  couples  were  barred  from  marrying \nconsistent with their sexual orientation.  This precedent \napplies here.  The Act bars all “students of the male sex” \nfrom playing on female teams, but only transgender female \nstudents are prohibited from playing on teams consistent \nwith their gender identity, and this distinction is plain from \nthe  face  of  the  statute.    Thus,  under  Latta,  the  Act \ndiscriminates on its face based on transgender status. \nIn Hecox II, moreover, we held that an Idaho transgender \nban similar to the Arizona law challenged here discriminated \non its face based on transgender status.  We reasoned that \n“the Act’s use of ‘biological sex’ functions as a form of \n‘[p]roxy discrimination’” because the Act’s “definition of \n‘biological sex’” was “carefully drawn to target transgender \nwomen  and  girls,  even  if  it  does  not  use  the  word \n‘transgender’ in the definition.”  Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1078 \n(quoting Pac.

HORNE \n730 F.3d 1142, 1160 n.23 (9th Cir. 2013)).11  We reach the \nsame  conclusion  here;  under  Hecox  II,  Arizona’s \ntransgender  ban  discriminates  on  its  face  based  on \ntransgender status. \nThis conclusion is consistent not only with common \nsense—there is simply no denying that a transgender sports \nban discriminates based on transgender status—but also with \nthe  decisions  of  other  courts,  which  have  held  that \ntransgender  sports  bans  like  the  one  challenged  here \ndiscriminate on their face against transgender women and \ngirls.    See  id.  (“In  addition  to  having  a  discriminatory \npurpose and effect, the Act is also facially discriminatory \nagainst transgender female athletes.”); B.P.J., 98 F.4th at \n555–56 (“If B.P.J. were a cisgender girl, she could play on \nher school’s girls teams.

It arises when the defendant enacts a \nlaw or policy that treats individuals differently on the \nbasis of seemingly neutral criteria that are so closely \nassociated  with  the  disfavored  group  that \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  such  criteria  is, \nconstructively,  facial  discrimination  against  the \ndisfavored group.  For example, discriminating against \nindividuals  with  gray  hair  is  a  proxy  for  age \ndiscrimination because “the ‘fit’ between age and gray \nhair is sufficiently close.” \n730 F.3d at 1160 n.23 (quoting McWright v.

Supp. 3d 930, \n975 (D. Idaho 2020) (“[T]he Act on its face discriminates \nbetween cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic \nteams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender \nwomen athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams \nconsistent with their gender identity.”). \nc. \nCiting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), and \nJana-Rock Construction, Inc. v. New York State Department \nof Economic Development, 438 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 2006), \nAppellants argue that rational basis review applies to the \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim because Plaintiffs assert an \nunderinclusiveness challenge to a remedial statute. \nIn  Morgan,  384  U.S.  at  656,  the  Supreme  Court \nconsidered a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge to \na  Voting  Rights  Act  provision  prohibiting  states  from \ndenying  the  vote  to  some  non-English  speakers  (those \neducated in schools in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories) \nbut  not  to  other  non-English  speakers  (those  educated \nbeyond U.S. territories).  Although classifications based on \nnational origin ordinarily trigger strict scrutiny, the Court \nheld  that  rational  basis  review  applied  because  “the \ndistinction challenged by appellees is presented only as a \nlimitation on a reform measure aimed at eliminating an \nexisting barrier to the exercise of the franchise.”  Id. at 657.  \nThe Court noted that a “statute is not invalid under the \nConstitution because it might have gone farther than it did,” \nthat a legislature need not “strike at all evils at the same \ntime,”  and  that  “reform  may  take  one  step  at  a  time, \naddressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 42 of 55\n42  DOE V. HORNE \nmost  acute  to  the  legislative  mind.”    Id.  (first  quoting \nRoschen v. Ward, 279 U.S. 337, 339 (1929), then quoting \nSemler v. Oregon State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 294 U.S. \n608, 610 (1935), and then quoting Williamson v. Lee Optical \nof Okla. Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955)).  In Jana-Rock, the \nSecond Circuit considered a Fourteenth Amendment equal \nprotection  challenge  to  a  New  York  affirmative  action \nprogram providing benefits to some Hispanics (those from \nLatin America) but not to other Hispanics (those from Spain \nand Portugal).  Although racial classifications  ordinarily \nprompt strict scrutiny, the Second Circuit applied rational \nbasis review because “once the government has shown that \nits decision to resort to explicit racial classifications survives \nstrict  scrutiny  by  being  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  a \ncompelling interest, its program is no longer presumptively \nsuspect.”  438 F.3d at 200.  The court declined “to apply \nautomatically strict scrutiny a second time in determining \nwhether an otherwise valid affirmative action program is \nunderinclusive for having excluded a particular plaintiff.”  \nId.; see also id. at 206–11. \nRelying on Morgan and Jana-Rock, Appellants argue \nthat rational basis review applies here.  They argue that the \nAct “is a remedial statute” because “[t]he Arizona legislature \npassed the law to provide girls and women a benefit—\nparticipation on their own sports teams—for the purpose of \npromoting opportunities for female athletes, ensuring the \nsafety  of  female  athletes,  and  remedying  past \ndiscrimination.”  Opening Br. at 18.  Further, they argue that \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim should be understood as an \nunderinclusiveness  challenge  because,  rather  than \nchallenging Arizona’s adoption of “sex-segregated sports \nteams,” in their view Plaintiffs’ claim is “that the definition \nof  ‘females,’  ‘women,’  and  ‘girls’  in  the  [Act]  is \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 43 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    43 \nunderinclusive—that the definition should be expanded to \ninclude not just biological females, but also at least some \nbiological males who identify as females, i.e., transgender \nathletes like themselves.”  Id. at 2. \nAppellants’ argument rests on the flawed premise that \nthe Act qualifies as remedial legislation.  The district court \nfound  that  “[t]he  Act  was  adopted  for  the  purpose  of \nexcluding transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports \nteams,” Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 963, and, as discussed \nearlier, that finding is not clearly erroneous.  Thus, the Act \nis not remedial, and Morgan and Jana-Rock do not control.  \nFurthermore, even in the context of an underinclusiveness \nchallenge to a remedial statute, heightened scrutiny applies \nwhere, as here, the plaintiff “demonstrate[s] that his or her \nexclusion  was  motivated  by  a  discriminatory  purpose.”  \nJana-Rock, 428 F.3d at 200.  Thus, even under Jana-Rock, \nheightened scrutiny applies here. \n2. \nTo withstand heightened scrutiny, a classification “must \nserve  important  governmental  objectives  and  must  be \nsubstantially related to achievement of those objectives.”  \nClark I, 695 F.2d at 1129 (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. \n190,  197  (1976)).    The  State  bears  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for \nthe classification, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, \n531 (1996), and “[t]he justification . . . must not rely on \noverbroad  generalizations  about  the  different  talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,” id. at 533.  \nHere, it is undisputed that the State’s asserted interests in \nensuring  competitive  fairness,  student  safety,  and  equal \nathletic opportunities for women and girls are important \ngovernmental  objectives.    The  question  is  whether  the \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 44 of 55\n44  DOE V. HORNE \ntransgender ban is substantially related to the achievement \nof these objectives. \nFour decades ago, we addressed whether an Arizona \npolicy excluding cisgender boys from girls’ sports violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  We upheld that policy because \nit  was  substantially  related  to  the  state’s  objectives  in \n“redressing past discrimination against women in athletics \nand promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the \nsexes.”    Clark  I,  695  F.2d  at  1131.    We  reached  that \nconclusion because: (1) “boys’ overall opportunity” to play \nschool sports was “not inferior to girls’”; (2) “males would \ndisplace females to a substantial extent” if cisgender boys \nwere  allowed  to  play  on  girls’  teams;  and  (3),  most \nimportantly, “average physiological differences” between \nboys  and  girls  “allow[ed]  gender  to  be  used  as  . . .  an \naccurate  proxy”  for  athletic  ability  and  competitive \nadvantage.  Id. (emphasis added).  None of these conditions \nis present here.12 \nFirst, the Act does not afford transgender women and \ngirls equal athletic opportunities.  The Act permits cisgender \nwomen and girls to play on any teams, male or female, while \ntransgender women and girls are permitted to play only on \nmale teams.  The Act also permits all students other than \ntransgender women and girls to play on teams consistent \nwith their gender identities; transgender women and girls \nalone are barred from doing so.  This is the essence of \ndiscrimination.  See Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. \n644, 657 (2020) (“To ‘discriminate against’ a person . . . \n \n12 As we noted in Hecox II, Clark I is also distinguishable from this case \nbecause the policy challenged in Clark I adversely affected cisgender \nboys, a historically favored group, rather than transgender women and \ngirls, a historically disfavored minority.  Hecox II, 104 F.4th at 1082. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 45 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    45 \nmean[s] treating that individual worse than others who are \nsimilarly situated.”). \nAlthough the Act allows transgender women and girls to \nplay  male  sports,  the  district  court  found  that  Plaintiffs \n“cannot play on boys’ sports teams.”  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d \nat 968.  The court reasoned that Plaintiffs have “athletic \ncapabilities like other girls [their] age,” that they would find \nplaying on boys’ teams “humiliating and embarrassing,” and \nthat “playing on a boys’ sports team and competing against \nboys would directly contradict [their] medical treatment for \ngender dysphoria and jeopardize [their] health.”  Id. at 968–\n69.  In fact, the court found that “[p]articipating in sports on \nteams that contradict one’s gender identity is equivalent to \ngender  identity  conversion  efforts,  which  every  major \nmedical  association  has  found  to  be  dangerous  and \nunethical.”  Id. (quoting Hecox I, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 977).  \nAs we explained in Hecox II, “[t]he argument . . . that the \nAct  does  not  discriminate  against  transgender  women \nbecause they can . . . play on men’s teams is akin to the \nargument we rejected in Latta[] that same-sex marriage bans \ndo not discriminate against gay men because they are free to \nmarry someone of the opposite sex.”  104 F.4th at 1083 \n(citing Latta, 771 F.3d at 467).13 \n \n13 The generally accepted medical practice is to treat people who suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria with “necessary, safe, and effective” gender-\naffirming medical care.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 957.  “The goal of \nmedical treatment for gender dysphoria is to alleviate a transgender \npatient’s distress by allowing them to live consistently with their gender \nidentity.”    Id.  at  958.    This  treatment,  “commonly  referred  to  as \n‘transition,’”  includes  “one  or  more  of  the  following  components: \n(i) social  transition,  including  adopting  a  new  name,  pronouns, \nappearance,  and  clothing,  and  correcting  identity  documents; \n(ii) medical  transition,  including  puberty-delaying  medication  and \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 46 of 55\n46  DOE V. HORNE \nSecond, the record does not demonstrate that transgender \nfemales would displace cisgender females to a substantial \nextent if transgender females were allowed to play on female \nteams.  As the district court noted in distinguishing Clark I, \n“[i]t is inapposite to compare the potential displacement [of] \nallowing approximately half of the population (cisgender \nmen) to compete with cisgender women, with any potential \ndisplacement  one  half  of  one  percent  of  the  population \n(transgender women) could cause cisgender women.”  Doe, \n683 F. Supp. 3d at 961 (footnote omitted) (quoting Hecox I, \n479 F. Supp. 3d at 977).  In the dozen or so years before \nadoption  of  the  Act,  the  AIA  approved  just  seven \ntransgender students to play on teams consistent with their \ngender identities—a tiny number when compared to the \nroughly 170,000 students playing school sports in Arizona \neach year.  Id.  During legislative hearings, proponents of the \nAct were unable to cite a single instance of a transgender girl \ndisplacing a cisgender girl on a girls’ sports team in Arizona. \nThird, after carefully considering the extensive expert \nevidence in the preliminary injunction record, the district \ncourt found that a student’s transgender status is not an \naccurate proxy for average athletic ability or competitive \nadvantage.  As noted, the district court cited “the scientific \nconsensus” that “the biological cause of average differences \nin athletic performance between men and women is . . . the \npresence of circulating levels of testosterone beginning with \nmale puberty,” Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 964, and that “[t]he \nbiological driver of average group differences in athletic \n \nhormone-replacement therapy; and (iii) for adults, surgeries to alter the \nappearance  and  functioning  of  primary-  and  secondary-sex \ncharacteristics.”  Id.  “For social transition to be clinically effective, it \nmust  be  respected  consistently  across  all  aspects  of  a  transgender \nindividual’s life.”  Id. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 47 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    47 \nperformance  between  adolescent  boys  and  girls  is  the \ndifference in their respective levels of testosterone, which \nonly  begin  to  diverge  significantly  after  the  onset  of \npuberty,” id. at 968. \nContrary to the expert opinion evidence relied upon by \nthe district court, the Act applies to all transgender women \nand girls, including those who the district court found do not \nhave an average athletic advantage over cisgender women \nand girls.  The district court found that, “[b]efore puberty, \nthere are no significant differences in athletic performance \nbetween  boys  and  girls,”  id.,  yet  the  ban  applies  to \ntransgender  kindergartners  who  are  too  young  to  have \nexperienced  male  puberty.    Although  prepubertal  boys \nsometimes  outperform  prepubertal  girls  on  school-based \nfitness  testing,  the  district  court  found  “no  basis  . . .  to \nattribute those small differences to physiology or anatomy \ninstead of” sociological factors.  Id. at 966. \nThe categorical ban includes transgender women and \ngirls, such as Plaintiffs, who receive puberty blockers and \nhormone therapy and never experience male puberty.  The \ndistrict court found that “[t]ransgender girls who receive \npuberty-blocking  medication  do  not  have  an  athletic \nadvantage over other girls because they do not undergo male \npuberty and do not experience the physiological changes \ncaused  by  the  increased  production  of  testosterone \nassociated with male puberty.”  Id. at 968.  The court also \nfound that “[t]ransgender girls who receive hormone therapy \nafter receiving puberty-blocking medication will develop the \nskeletal structure, fat distribution, and muscle and breast \ndevelopment typical of other girls,” and “will typically have \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 48 of 55\n48  DOE V. HORNE \nthe same levels of circulating estrogen and testosterone as \nother girls.”  Id.14   \nGiven these well-supported factual findings, the district \ncourt properly concluded that Appellants are unlikely to \nestablish  that  the  Act’s  sweeping  transgender  ban  is \nsubstantially related to achievement of the State’s important \ngovernmental objectives in ensuring competitive fairness \nand equal athletic opportunity for female student-athletes.  \nThe Act’s transgender ban applies not only to all transgender \nwomen  and  girls  in  Arizona,  regardless  of  circulating \ntestosterone levels or other medically accepted indicia of \ncompetitive advantage, but also to all sports, regardless of \nthe  physical  contact  involved,  the  type  or  level  of \ncompetition,  or  the  age  or  grade  of  the  participants.  \nHeightened scrutiny does not require narrow tailoring, but it \ndoes  require a  substantial relationship between the ends \nsought  and  the  discriminatory  means  chosen  to  achieve \nthem.  See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  Appellants have not \nmade that showing here. \nWe recognize that the research in this field is ongoing \nand that standards governing transgender participation in \nsports are evolving.  In the last few years alone, both the \nNCAA  and  International  Olympic  Committee  have \n \n14 The Act also includes transgender women and girls who have gone \nthrough male puberty but receive gender-affirming hormone therapy to \nsuppress their circulating testosterone levels.  Dr. Shumer testified that \n“studies  on  transgender  women  who  have  undergone  testosterone \nsuppression as adults . . . show that testosterone suppression resulted in \nsignificant  mitigation  of  muscle  mass  and  development  in  adult \ntransgender women.”  See Shumer Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 17–18.  These \ntransgender  women  do  not  appear  to  have  a  competitive  athletic \nadvantage.    See  id.  ¶ 19  (citing  Joanna  Harper,  Race  Times  for \nTransgender Athletes, 6 J. Sporting Cultures & Identities 1 (2015)). \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 49 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    49 \ntightened  their  transgender  eligibility  policies—although \nneither organization has adopted anything like Arizona’s \ncategorical  ban  on  transgender  females  participating  in \nfemale sports.  Legislatures are not prohibited from acting \n“in the face of medical uncertainty,” Carhart, 550 U.S. at \n166, and “[l]ife-tenured federal judges should be wary of \nremoving a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from \nthe ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely \nunamendable Constitution to occupy the field,” L.W. ex rel. \nWilliams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 471 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. \ngranted, 2024 WL 3089532 (U.S. June 24, 2024) (No. 23-\n477).  But neither Carhart nor Skrmetti applied heightened \nscrutiny, as we are obliged to do, and that standard requires \nthe  State  to  demonstrate  an  “exceedingly  persuasive \njustification”  for  a  discriminatory  classification,  without \nrelying on “overbroad generalizations about the different \ntalents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.”  \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 531, 533.15  The district court was \nbound to rule on Plaintiffs’ request for limited injunctive \nrelief based on the evidence in the record before it.  To be \nsure,  future  cases  may  have  different  outcomes  if  the \nevolving science supports different findings.  But the court \ndid not have the luxury of waiting for further research to be \nconducted; “we cannot avoid the duty to decide an issue \nsquarely presented to us.”  United States v. Booker, 375 F.3d \n508, 513 (7th Cir. 2004), aff’d, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). \nWe reject Appellants’ argument that the Act survives \nintermediate scrutiny because it directly advances the State’s \n \n15 See Carhart, 550 U.S. at 166 (addressing whether the challenged law \nwas “rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends”); Skrmetti, 83 F.4th at \n486 (applying rational basis review to an equal protection challenge to \nstate laws prohibiting doctors from providing gender-affirming medical \ncare to minors). \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 50 of 55\n50  DOE V. HORNE \nobjectives “roughly 99.996 percent of the time.”  Reply Br. \nat 26.  In Appellants’ view, even if the ban does not directly \nadvance  the  State’s  legitimate  objectives  as  applied  to \ntransgender women and girls who have not experienced male \npuberty, such as Plaintiffs, the Act is substantially related to \nthe State’s interests because it advances legitimate State \ninterests as applied to cisgender men and boys, who make up \nthe vast majority of students affected by the legislation.  \nBecause, as noted, the Act does not actually affect cisgender \nmen and boys, this argument is unpersuasive.16 \nSo, too, is Appellants’ argument that the Act satisfies \nheightened scrutiny because it directly advances the State’s \nobjectives as applied to some transgender female athletes—\nthose who have experienced male puberty and who have not \nreceived  hormone  therapy  to  suppress  their  levels  of \ncirculating testosterone.  Appellants correctly point out that \n“[n]one  of  [the  Supreme  Court’s]  gender-based \nclassification equal protection cases have required that the \nstatute under consideration must be capable of achieving its \nultimate objective in every instance.”  Tuan Anh Nguyen v. \nINS, 533 U.S. 53, 70 (2001).  But the State does not carry its \nburden  by  showing  that  a  classification  is  capable  of \nachieving  its  ultimate  objective  in  some  circumstances.  \nHeightened scrutiny requires that the means adopted by the \nState  must  be  “in  substantial  furtherance  of  important \ngovernmental objectives.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Moreover, \nthe Act’s practical effect is to displace the existing AIA and \nNCAA  policies  which  already  limit  the  participation  of \n \n16 Because Plaintiffs do not challenge the Act’s sex classification, the \nquestion presented is simply whether “excluding transgender girls from \ngirls sports teams” is substantially related to important governmental \ninterests, not whether excluding all “students of the male sex” from such \nsports is justified.  See B.P.J., 98 F.4th at 559. \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 51 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    51 \ntransgender athletes based in part on levels of circulating \ntestosterone. \nB. \nThe district court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed not only on their equal protection claim but also on \ntheir Title IX claim.  Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 974–75.  \nAppellants challenge this conclusion, arguing that Title IX \nis unenforceable in this case because the State lacked clear \nnotice that excluding transgender women and girls from \nfemale sports violates the statute.  See Arlington Cent. Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) \n(“Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it \ndisburses federal money to the States, but when Congress \nattaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of federal funds, \nthe conditions must be set out ‘unambiguously.’” (citations \nomitted)  (quoting  Pennhurst  State  Sch.  &  Hosp.  v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981))). \nAlthough not addressed by the district court, this is a \ncolorable  argument  because  Title  IX  regulations  permit \nschools to “operate or sponsor separate teams for members \nof each sex,” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), and it may not have \nbeen clear to the State when it accepted federal funding that \nthis  provision  does  not  authorize  distinctions  based  on \nassigned sex.  Cf. Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 815–16 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(“Under  the  Spending  Clause’s  required  clear-statement \nrule,  the  School  Board’s  interpretation  that  [Title  IX’s] \nbathroom  carve-out[,  34  C.F.R.  § 106.33,]  pertains  to \nbiological sex would only violate Title IX if the meaning of \n‘sex’ unambiguously meant something other than biological \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 52 of 55\n52  DOE V.

Because \nSecretary Horne (the only party formally enjoined by the \npreliminary injunction, see Doe, 683 F. Supp. 3d at 977) was \nproperly enjoined based on the district court’s conclusion \nthat Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nequal  protection  claim,  we  need  not  decide  whether \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX \nclaim as well.  The district court should address the Spending \nClause  issue  in  the  first  instance  if  raised  in  further \nproceedings.  We express no opinion on how  the issue \nshould be resolved. \nV. \nHaving determined that the district court did not err by \nconcluding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their equal \nprotection claim, we turn to whether the district court abused \nits  discretion  in  addressing  the  remaining  preliminary \ninjunction factors. \nA. \nPlaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \nthat they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof relief.  Johnson, 572 F.3d at 1078.  Appellants argue that \n \n17  The  Department  of  Education  has  proposed  an  amendment  to \n§ 106.41(b) that would clarify that Title IX does not authorize the \ncategorical exclusion of transgender female students from female sports.  \nSee Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or \nActivities  Receiving  Federal  Financial  Assistance:  Sex-Related \nEligibility Criteria for Male and Female Athletic Teams, 88 Fed. Reg. \n22,860  (proposed  Apr.  13,  2023)  (to  be  codified  at  34  C.F.R. \n§ 106.41(b)(2)). \n\nCase 4:23-cv-00185-JGZ     Document 243-1     Filed 10/01/24     Page 53 of 55\n  DOE V. HORNE    53 \n“Plaintiffs’ claim of irreparable harm is inconsistent with \ntheir delay in seeking injunctive relief,” because “[n]early a \nyear passed . . . before they challenged” the Act.  Opening \nBr. at 67.  See Oakland Trib., Inc. v. Chron. Pub. Co., 762 \nF.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Plaintiff’s long delay \nbefore seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of \nurgency and irreparable harm.”); see also Garcia v. Google, \nInc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (noting that \ndelay can undercut a claim of irreparable harm). \nWe disagree.  Plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief just seven months after the Act took effect.  This was \nnot a long delay in this context, and even if it were, “delay is \nbut  a  single  factor  to  consider  in  evaluating  irreparable \ninjury,” and “‘courts are loath to withhold relief solely on \nthat ground.’”  Arc of California, 757 F.3d at 990 (quoting \nLydo Enters., Inc. v. City of Las Vegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1214 \n(9th Cir. 1984)).  Furthermore, even a long delay “is not \nparticularly probative in the context of ongoing, worsening \ninjuries.”  Id.18 \nAppellants argue that Plaintiffs fail to show irreparable \nharm because their “claims of harm stem from their gender \ndysphoria diagnosis” rather than the Act.

In any \nevent, we ordinarily will not consider arguments raised for \nthe first time on appeal.19 \nB. \nAppellants  argue  that  the  final  two  preliminary \ninjunction factors—the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest—favor the denial of preliminary injunctive relief \nbecause “Plaintiffs will displace biological female athletes” \nif they are allowed to play on girls’ teams.  Opening Br. at \n69.  The record, however, shows that “Megan’s teammates, \ncoaches, and school are highly supportive of her and would \nwelcome her participation on the girls’ volleyball team,” \nDoe, 683 F.

Appellants \n \n19 Appellants point out that “it is claims that are deemed waived or \nforfeited, not arguments.”  United States v. Blackstone, 903 F.3d 1020, \n1025 n.2 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting United States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 \nF.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004)); see Exxon Shipping Co. v.

We note that nothing in today’s decision, or in \nthe district court’s decision, precludes policymakers from \nadopting appropriate regulations in this field—regulations \nthat  are  substantially  related  to  important  governmental \nobjectives.  See Clark I, 695 F.2d at 1129.  States have \nimportant  interests  in  inclusion,  nondiscrimination, \ncompetitive fairness, student safety, and completing the still \nunfinished  and  important  job  of  ensuring  equal  athletic \nopportunities for women and girls, who must have an equal \nopportunity not only to participate in sports but also to \ncompete and win.  We hold only that the district court did \nnot abuse its discretion by enjoining Arizona from barring \nJane and Megan from playing school sports consistent with \ntheir gender identity while this litigation is pending. \nAFFIRMED.
