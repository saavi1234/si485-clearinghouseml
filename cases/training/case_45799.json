Faced with a cascade of post-Covid evictions, soaring homelessness, and rising\nhousing unaffordability, the New York City Council held hearings and ultimately passed\na package of bills in the summer of 2023 expanding the CityFHEPS rental subsidy\nprogram. CityFHEPS is designed to be similar to the federal Section 8 program where\ntenants pay 30% of income in rent and the City pays the balance.\n2. In response to this thoughtful legislative process, the Mayor vetoed the entire\npackage. On July 13, 2023, the Council voted 42 to 8 to override the Mayor's veto, and\nthe laws went into effect on January 9, 2024. In December 2023, however, the City\nannounced publicly that it would not implement the laws.\n1 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 02/14/2024\n3. Petitioners, long-term tenants facing eviction from their affordable apartments,\nand a family languishing in shelter, bring this mandamus proceeding seeking CityFHEPS\nvouchers on behalf of themselves and the class of households who would be eligible for\nCityFHEPS vouchers under the duly passed laws. With CityFHEPS, petitioners can stay\nhoused and exit shelter. Without the vouchers, Petitioners will be evicted or will be\nforced to remain in shelter.\nJURISDICTION\nPetitioners'\n4. The Court has jurisdiction over claims pursuant to C.P.L.R. § 7801.\nVENUE\n5. Venue is proper in the County of New York pursuant to C.P.L.R. §§ 7804(b) and\nRespondents'\n506(b) because principal offices are in New York County and its violation\nof Local Law 99-102 occurred in that County.\nPARTIES\n6. Petitioner Marie Vincent, a cancer survivor, resides in a shelter in Harlem with\nher 12-year-old grandson. The family entered shelter in May 2023, when they were\nforced from their longtime home in the Bronx after a new landlord purchased the building\nand evicted all the tenants. She works nights in housekeeping at a hospital and is eligible\nfor CityFHEPS with her current income pursuant to newly enacted Local Law 100 of\n2023. Despite identifying several eligible apartments, Ms. Vincent cannot obtain a\nCityFHEPS shopping letter required to secure an apartment and thus cannot exit shelter\nwith her grandson because Respondents refuse to implement the CityFHEPS Reform\nLaws.\n7. Petitioner Carolina Tejeda resides in an apartment in the Bronx with her 11-year-\nold daughter. She is disabled and cannot afford the low $1254.60 monthly rent with her\n2\n2 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 02/14/2024\nfixed income of $1213.00 per month. When Ms. Tejeda was approved for Social Security\nDisability Insurance (\"SSDI\") in 2021, she was no longer eligible for public assistance\nand thus lost the Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (\"FHEPS\") that critically\nenabled her to afford the rent. Ms. Tejeda is now facing eviction in housing court but\ncannot obtain CityFHEPS because Respondents refuse to implement the CityFHEPS\nReform Laws expanding assistance to income-eligible households at risk of eviction.\n8. Petitioner Mary Cronneit is an 86-year-old Brooklyn resident who has lived in her\ncurrent apartment for over 20 years. After her husband died during the COVID-19\npandemic, she was unable to pay the $1006.06 monthly rent because she had no\nindependent source of income. Advocates recently assisted her with applying for public\nassistance and food benefits (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or \"SNAP\").\nDue to the rental arrears that accrued after her husband passed away, Ms. Cronneit is now\nfacing eviction. She is eligible for CityFHEPS pursuant to Local Law 101 but cannot\naccess this critical subsidy because Respondents refuse to implement the CityFHEPS\nReform Laws.\n9. Petitioner Susan Acks is a 65-year-old disabled Brooklyn resident who has lived\nin her current apartment for almost 40 years. While her monthly rent is $1,062.33, she is\nunable to afford it with her $948.00 monthly income. As a result, she owes significant\nrental arrears and is at risk of eviction. She is eligible for CityFHEPS pursuant to Local\nLaw 101 but cannot access this critical subsidy Respondents refuse to implement the\nCityFHEPS Reform Laws.\n10.

The named petitioners bring this proceeding on their own behalf and on behalf of\na proposed class consisting of all New York City households that are eligible to receive a\nCityFHEPS voucher under Local Laws 99, 100, 101, and 102, but are unable to obtain a\nCityFHEPS voucher because the City refuses to implement the new laws.\n13. The proposed class seeks class certification and mandamus relief.\nII. The Class Meets the Requirements for Class Certification\n14. This class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Although\nthe exact number and identities of the members of the Class are currently unknown to\nPetitioners, on information and belief, thousands of households who are in shelter and in\nthe community are eligible to receive a CityFHEPS voucher due to the CityFHEPS\nRespondents'\nexpansion but cannot receive the benefit because of failure to implement\nthe law.\n15. Nearly all factual, legal, and statutory relief issues that are raised in this petition\nare common to, and will apply uniformly to, each member of the Class.\n16. There are questions of fact and law common to the class, including but not limited\nto, whether Respondents must implement the laws duly enacted by the New York City\nCouncil.\n17. The claims of the named petitioners are typical of the claims of the class in that\neach petitioner meets the eligibility criteria for receipt of a CityFHEPS voucher but\nRespondents'\ncannot access this benefit due to failure to implement the law.\n4\n4 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 02/14/2024\nRespondents'\n18. Mandamus relief is appropriate for the class because failure to act is\napplicable to the class.\n19. There are no material conflicts between the claims of the named Petitioners and\nthe members of the Class that would make class certification inappropriate.\n20. The named Petitioners and the proposed class are represented by The Legal Aid\nSociety, whose attorneys are experienced in class action litigation and will adequately\nrepresent the class. Counsel for the Class will vigorously assert the claims of all\nmembers of the Class.\n21. A class action is superior to other available methods for a fair and efficient\nadjudication of this matter in that the prosecution of separate actions by individual class\nmembers would unduly burden the Court and create the possibility of conflicting\ndecisions.\nFACTS\nI The Governing Regulatory Scheme\nA. Background on CityFHEPS\n22. To address the enormous and dire need for expanded access to rental assistance\nfor New Yorkers experiencing and at risk of homelessness, the New York City Human\nResources Administration (\"HRA\") launched New York City's rental supplement\n2018.1\nprogram, CityFHEPS, in October CityFHEPS consolidated a number of the City's\npre-existing voucher programs (LINC, CITYFEPS, and SEPS), with the goal of more\neffectively and efficiently administering City-funded rental assistance. CityFHEPS is a\nsubsidy that helps tenants pay the rent; tenants pay 30% of their household income in rent\nand the City contributes the remaining balance up to a maximum amount.\n1\nCity Record, Vol. 145, No. 189, at 5328 (Sept. 28, 2018). CityFHEPS stands for City Fighting Homelessness and\nEviction Prevention Supplement.\n5\n5 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 02/14/2024\n23. From its inception, the CityFHEPS program has been hampered by overly strict\ncriteria and a policy design that focused almost exclusively on assisting families only\nafter they entered shelter. Additionally, the program's complicated bureaucratic\nprocesses and rigid requirements have contributed to a low utilization rate. A policy\nreport from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies estimated that households in\nshelter typically spend one to three years in the process of obtaining CityFHEPS before\nvoucher.2\nexiting shelter with a\n24. One of the major issues faced by eligible households trying to use CityFHEPS to\nexit the shelter system was that maximum rents for the program were set at 85% of the\nSection 8 levels, making it very difficult for homeless households or households at risk of\neviction to utilize the vouchers. For example, a household of two was required to find an\napartment in New York City with a maximum rent of $1323. The vacancy rate for\napartments with asking rents between $1,000 and $1,499 per month was only 2.52\nsince.3\npercent in 2017, a rate that has continuously declined\n25. To address the CityFHEPS program's prohibitively low maximum rents the City\nCouncil passed Local Law 71 in 2021, setting maximum rents at the same payment\nstandard used for federal Section 8 vouchers, and allowing households that remained\notherwise eligible to continue receiving annual renewals of their vouchers after their fifth\nyear in the CityFHEPS rental assistance program.\n26. Later that same year, the City implemented Local Law 71 as required, by\namending Title 68 of the Rules of the City of New York, increasing the maximum rents\nfor CityFHEPS apartments to the Section 8 payment standard adopted by the New York\nCity Housing Authority. The increase to maximum rents significantly widened the pool\n2 \"\nCatherine Darin, \"Maximizing the Benefits of Housing Vouchers in New York City.

NO. 1 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 02/14/2024\nof CityFHEPS eligible apartments, giving households a better chance at leaving shelter\nand maintaining affordable housing.\n27. Despite these important improvements to the CityFHEPS program, there\nremained significant barriers to access, especially for households facing eviction from\nlow-rent apartments. To use CityFHEPS to prevent eviction, tenants had to meet a series\nof highly restrictive, complex criteria, which included having an active case in housing\ncourt and recent shelter history or an active Adult Protective Services (\"APS\") case or\nbeing a veteran at risk of homelessness or a tenant facing eviction from one of the\napproximately 16,000 rent-controlled apartments remaining in the city (compared to over\n1,000,000 rent-stabilized apartments). These rules arbitrarily excluded tenants like\nPetitioners Tejeda, Cronneit and Acks whose regulated rents are far below market but are\nstill well above their ability to afford with their limited incomes.\n28. Under these rules, Petitioners Tejeda, Cronneit and Acks would be forced to\nrelinquish longtime tenancies in rent stabilized apartments with low rents and enter the\nshelter system in order to access a housing subsidy meant to reduce homelessness.\nSignificantly, Petitioners Tejeda and Acks would also lose the important benefit of the\nDRIE program, which freezes the rent of participating tenants.\n29. Shelter residents also continued to struggle with burdensome eligibility criteria,\nlike waiting 90 days after entering shelter to simply apply for a voucher and being\nrequired to apply for public assistance regardless of eligiblity.\n30. Income eligibility also persisted as a hurdle to obtaining a CityFHEPS voucher\nfor low-income working families both at risk of and experiencing homelessness. Any\nhousehold with income over 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, which was less than\n$40,000 a year for a family of two in 2023, could not obtain a voucher. To contrast, 50%\nof Area Median Income (\"AMI\") in New York City for a household of two is $56,500. A\nhousehold of two with an annual income of $40,000 can afford to pay only $1000 in rent\na month. This punitive income limit results in working, low-income families making too\n7\n7 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC.

Obtaining an eligibility determination did not signify the end to barriers erected in\nthe paths of households trying to secure affordable housing through the CityFHEPS\nprogram. The program's confusing utility allowance deduction scheme prohibits\nparticipants from renting units at the statutory maximum if, like most New York\napartments, the tenant must pay for her own utilities. HRA's utility provisions therefore\nreduce the number of apartments available to voucher holders, without conferring any\nbenefit on the tenant family.\nB. 2023 CityFHEPS Expansion\n32. The end of the pandemic-related eviction moratorium in January 2022 triggered a\nsurge in nonpayment filings in New York City housing court. Evictions have been rising\nsteadily since, nearly tripling from 2022 to 2023, with low-income communities of color\nin Central Brooklyn and South and Central Bronx experiencing the highest rates.\nEvictions are on track to surpass pre-pandemic levels; there were 119 more evictions in\n(2,365).4\nOctober and November 2023 (2,484) than in the same period in 2019\n33. The rising number of evictions post-moratorium coincided with historically high\nlevels of homelessness, climbing rents and a steadily declining inventory of affordable\napartments. By the beginning of 2023, there were over 70,000 individuals sleeping in\nNew York City shelters each night, a majority longtime New Yorkers, compared to\n2022.5\n45,000 at the start of\n34.

The hearings were called to highlight deficiencies of the CityFHEPS program and\nthe significant need for proposed reforms. Over 30 organizations and community\nmembers testified in support of expanded CityFHEPS eligibility criteria, including:\nCitizens'\nVOCAL-NY, Community Service Society, Committee for Children of New\nYork, Women in Need (WIN), Coalition for the Homeless, New York City Comptroller\nBrad Lander, Make the Road New York, Neighborhood Defender Service, Safe Horizon,\nNew York Legal Assistance Group, Her Justice and The Legal Aid Society. Additionally,\nthe Robin Hood Foundation, in collaboration with The Century Foundation and Next 100,\npublished a report in early 2022, recommending targeted reforms to the CityFHEPS\nprogram focusing on preventing evictions from happening in the first place, and\npromoting housing stability by expanding eligibility.\n36. On May 25, 2023, following the hearings the City Council passed Intro 229-A\n(later Local Law 99), Intro 878-A (later Local Law 100), Intro 893-A (later Local Law\n101), and Intro 894-A (later Local Law 102) amending CityFHEPS (\"City FHEPS\nexpansion\"). Together, these laws simplify and expand CityFHEPS eligibility for\nhouseholds in shelter and at risk of eviction and increase the benefit's value by changing\nthe way utility allowances are treated. See, Exhibit A, Local Laws 99-102.\n37. Local Law 100 ended the rule that required households to live in shelter for 90-\ndays before they could be eligible for CityFHEPS and prohibits the Department of Social\nServices from requiring an applicant to have resided or reside in a shelter of any kind.\nCity Council Member Diana Ayala, who sponsored the bill that became Local Law 100,\n\"arduous\"\ndescribed the 90-day rule as stating that it puts \"unnecessary burdens on those\nhousing\"\nseeking permanent and, \"exacerbated the existing strains on our shelter system\nby preventing individuals and families from moving out and becoming stably housed as\n9\n9 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC.

Local Law 101 expanded eligibility for a CityFHEPS rental assistance voucher to\ninclude any income-eligible applicant household at risk of eviction or experiencing\nhomelessness. Upon introducing Intro 893-A (later Local Law 101), bill sponsor\nCouncilmember Pierina Sanchez stated, \"In Bronx Community District 5, one in ten\nhouseholds faced eviction last year. This means children are forced to commute\nsometimes 90 minutes to two hours from a shelter in Queens to their school on Tremont\nAvenue in the Bronx, severing vital social bonds and support networks for them and for\ntheir families.

On June 16, 2023, the HRA issued emergency rules at the direction of Mayor\nAdams, amending the CityFHEPS rules to eliminate the 90-day stay requirement for\nsingle adults and families and reduced the number of hours that families are required to\nwork to become eligible for CityFHEPS from 14 to 10 hours per week. The emergency\nrule added requirements that were absent from the newly enacted Council laws, including\nimplementing a 10-hour per week work requirement for single adults and prohibiting a\nhousehold moving out of shelter from moving into a residence they resided in at any\npoint during the prior year.\n42. On June 23, 2023, the Mayor vetoed Intros 229-A, 878-A, 893-A and 894-A.\n(Charter Section 37(b)).\n43. On July 13, 2023, the City Council overrode the Mayor's vetoes by a margin of\n42-8 and assigned them Local Law numbers 99, 100, 101 and 102, pursuant to its powers\nunder Charter Section 37(b).

Ms. Vincent works at night in housekeeping at a hospital and is eligible for\nCityFHEPS under Local Law 100 with her current income of approximately $48,000 per\nyear. Because her income is above the current City's maximum for CityFHEPS ($39,220\nfor a household of two), however, she cannot obtain a CityFHEPS voucher. To contrast,\n50% of Area Median Income (\"AMI\") in New York City for a household of two is\n$56,500. If Respondent implemented Local Law 100, Ms. Vincent's income would allow\nher to obtain a CityFHEPS shopping letter required to secure an apartment.\n49. Ms. Vincent attempted to reduce her hours to become income eligible for\nCityFHEPS, however she was still assessed as over income and the negative impact on\nher ability to meet her other financial responsibilities, especially purchasing food for\nherself and her grandson, is not sustainable.\n50. Despite identifying multiple eligible apartments, Ms. Vincent cannot obtain a\nCityFHEPS shopping letter required to secure an apartment and her family is languishing\nin shelter because Respondents refuse to implement the CityFHEPS Reform Laws. She\ncannot find an apartment she can afford on her own. With her income, she can only\nafford an apartment with a rent of $1200.00. The vacancy rate for units renting for $1,100\npercent.\"\nto $1,649 is less than one\n51.

Ms. Tejeda's monthly rent is frozen because\nshe participates in the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (\"DRIE\") program.\n53. Ms. Tejeda worked hard for most of her life to support herself and her family. But\nin 2011 she sustained devastating injuries in a car accident, including a fractured pelvis\nand traumatic brain injury, and became permanently disabled.\n54. Despite her permanent injuries, Ms. Tejeda continued working to support her\nhousehold and keep a roof overhead. She worked until about 2019, when she was forced\nto stop due to worsening health issues.\n55. Ms. Tejeda's disabilities include chronic pelvic and hip issues from the accident,\nfatigue, headaches, osteoarthritis in both hands, diabetes and anemia requiring blood\ntransfusions, among other issues. These conditions leave Ms. Tejeda with regular\nheadaches, pain, difficulty seeing, difficulty walking, and other symptoms.\n56. Soon after she stopped working, Ms. Tejeda faced eviction in housing court for\nfalling behind in rent. She applied for public assistance and was able obtain a New York\nState Family Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement (\"FHEPS\") subsidy.\nWith FHEPS, Ms. Tejeda's eviction was prevented, and she could afford the rent going\nforward.\n57. Knowing that she could not support her family with public assistance benefits\nalone, Ms. Tejeda applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (\"SSDI\"), which she\nwas approved for based on her work history and disabilities.\n58. After Ms. Tejeda was approved for SSDI, she became ineligible to continue\nreceiving public assistance. Because eligibility for cash assistance is a requirement for\nFHEPS, her FHEPS voucher was terminated, leaving Ms. Tejeda solely responsible for\npaying the rent. Ms. Tejeda receives about $1,213.00 in SSDI each month, less than her\nlow rent of $1,254.60.\n14\n14 of 20\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 02/14/2024 10:11 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC.

Petitioner Mary Cronneit is 86 years old and has resided in the same apartment in\nBrooklyn, New York for over 22 years. Her monthly rent is $1006.06, and her apartment\nis rent stabilized.\n62. After Ms. Cronneit's husband died during the COVID-19 pandemic, she was\nunable to pay the $1006.06 monthly rent because she had no independent source of\nincome and began accruing arrears.\n63. Ms. Cronneit's husband was responsible for all the household finances. After he\npassed away, she was left trying to survive with no income and some family support for\nbare necessities.

Due to the rental arrears that accrued after her husband passed, she is now facing\neviction. Ms. Cronneit's landlord commenced a nonpayment eviction proceeding in 2021\nand is now seeking approximately $16,000.00 in rental arrears. Without a CityFHEPS\nvoucher, she cannot afford her rent.

NO. 138 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/02/2024\n \nand 102 of 2023, (the “City FHEPS Reform Laws”) and directing respondents and their agencies \nto immediately implement the City FHEPS expansion by offering vouchers to petitioners and all \nsimilarly situated applicants who are eligible under the newly enacted laws.  Petitioners are New \nYork City tenants who are in jeopardy of eviction and families or individuals who reside in \nshelter or are otherwise homeless. \n  Respondents, Mayor Eric Adams and the City of New York, contend that the City \nCouncil’s enactment of the City FHEPS Reform Laws is unlawful based on preemption by state \nlaw.  Respondents also argue that to the extent the Court declines to find that the subject laws are \npreempted, mandamus is inappropriate, and the appropriate remedy is declaratory judgment as to \nthe validity of the new laws. \nThe City Council passed the City FHEPS Reform Laws which were ultimately vetoed by \nMayor Eric Adams.  The Council then overrode the Mayor’s veto by a supermajority, pursuant to \nits powers granted by the New York City Charter § 37(b).  Respondents refused to implement \nthose laws guided by the belief that the laws are legally invalid and are preempted by the New \nYork State Social Services Law (the “SSL”) and should have been passed through referendum.  \nThe issue is not whether the Council’s action of overriding the Mayor’s veto was lawful but \nrather whether the subject of the legislation is preempted by state law.  \nIntervention \n  First, the Court will address the multitude of parties seeking to intervene in this special \nproceeding, motions sequences 002, 003, 005, and 006.   As to, motion sequence 002, the parties \nconsented to the City Council’s intervention in this action as per a stipulation between the \nparties.  See NYSCEF Doc. 49. \n   \n450563/2024 Motion No.  001 002 003 005 006  Page 2 of 6 \n \n2 of 6\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 08/06/2024 11:59 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 138 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/02/2024\n \nAs to the remaining motions of the proposed petitioners and respondents, the Court does \nnot find that intervention is appropriate in this matter.  The sole issue before this Court is \nwhether the respondents are required to implement the laws, as passed by the City Council, not \nwhether the proposed intervenors would be eligible for such benefits.  To the extent the proposed \nintervenors already have matters pending in Housing Court, that is the appropriate venue for \nthose matters.  A determination here that the respondents are not implementing the laws as \npassed by the City Council is not a determination that any of the proposed petitioner intervenors \nwould be entitled to the benefits that the laws seek to provide.  It is for those same reasons that \nthe Court finds class certification inappropriate.   \nThe Underlying Petition \n  Preliminarily, it appears undisputed that once the City Council has passed valid \nlegislation the Mayor has a duty to implement the legislation (Council of City of New York v \nBloomberg, 6 NY3d 380, 389 [2006]).  “[A] strong presumption of validity attaches to legislative \nenactments, imposing upon a party who challenges the constitutionality of a statute a heavy \nburden of establishing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt” (Metro. Package Store \nAssn. v Koch, 89 AD2d 317, 324 [3d Dept 1982]).  \nPetitioners’ position is that the City FHEPS Reform Laws are neither preempted by the \nSSL, and further contend, that the Mayor’s argument of preemption is violative of the Municipal \nHome Rule, which provides, pursuant to the New York State Constitution, that localities may \nadopt and amend local laws for the well-being of its citizens.  Petitioners contend that the City \nFHEPS Reform Laws are an exercise of that power. \nThe parties primary focus on preemption involves language in the SSL, specifically \n“social services districts.”  Petitioners contend that the local legislature, the City Council, not \n   \n450563/2024 Motion No.  001 002 003 005 006  Page 3 of 6 \n \n3 of 6\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 08/06/2024 11:59 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 138 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/02/2024\n \nonly the City Department of Social Services is meant to be included in the definition of a social \nservice district, thus it is with equal authority to supplement the public assistance programs \npursuant to the SSL. Petitioners argue that the NYS SSL contemplates that local legislatures will \nfill in the gaps and supplement rental assistance programs. \nIn opposition, respondents contend that the entity serves as the “social services district” is \nthe City DSS, not the City Council, that has received authority from the State to set social \nservices policy.  For this reason, the Council’s new laws conflict with that state law delegation of \npolicymaking authority and are preempted.  \nDiscussion \n  The Court finds that respondent have, beyond a reasonable doubt, established that the \nCity FHEPS Reforms Laws are invalid, based on field preemption.  The Court agrees with \nrespondents, that the Court of Appeals holding in Beaudoin, is binding precedent and ends the \ninquiry regarding the state delegation of authority.  \nIn New York State, the social services program is a State program, \nadministered through the 58 local social services districts under the \ngeneral supervision of the State Department of Social Services and \nthe State Commissioner of Social Services. (NY Const, art XVII, § \n1; Social Services Law, §§ 17, 20, 34.) The county commissioners \nare denominated by statute \"agents\" of the State department (Social \nServices  Law,  §  65,  subd  3).  In  the  administration  of  public \nassistance funds, whether they come from Federal, State or local \nsources,  the  authority  and  responsibility  is  that  of  the  county \ncommissioners  of  social  services,  not  the  counties;  the  local \ncommissioners act on behalf of and as agents for the State. Each is \na part of and the local arm of the single State administrative agency. \n \n(Beaudoin v Toia, 45 NY2d 343, 347 [1978]). The SSL does not provide a role for  \n \nlocal legislation in the administration of social services programs.  \n“The doctrine of preemption acts as a significant restriction on the home rule powers of \nmunicipalities. Local laws may be inconsistent with and preempted by state law either because \n   \n450563/2024 Motion No.  001 002 003 005 006  Page 4 of 6 \n \n4 of 6\n\nFILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 08/06/2024 11:59 AM INDEX NO. 450563/2024\nNYSCEF DOC.

Assn. v Town of Guilderland, 74 NY2d 372, 377 \n[1989). \nThe Court finds that entity that serves as the “social services district” that has received \nauthority from the State to set social services policy is City DSS, and consequently the Council’s \nnew laws conflict with that state law delegation of policymaking authority and is preempted.  \nThe Court is also not persuaded by petitioners’ contention that the Mayor’s own previous \npractice somehow waives respondents’ rights from raising the issue of preemption now.  The \nCourt does not find that while this current mayoral administration, and possibly prior \nadministrations, failed to raise this issue, that failure is an admission that the subject matter here \nis not field preempted.  The Council provides no legal basis for this proposition and the Court \ndeclines to adopt it in this context, where, to this Court, both statutory and binding Court of \nAppeals precedent mandates the result that this Court adopts.  Based on the foregoing, the \npetitions are denied.   \nAccordingly, it is hereby \n  ORDERED that the petitions, motions sequences 001 and 002, and motions sequences \n003, 005, and 006 are hereby denied. \n \n8/2/2024             \nDATE  LYLE E.
