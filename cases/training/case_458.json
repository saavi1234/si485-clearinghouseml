    "summary": "<p>On February 21, 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The plaintiff asked the district court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of patients at the Rosewood State Hospital (RSH) in Owings Mill, Maryland.  RSH was a facility where citizens with intellectual disabilities were confined for the purpose of treatment, and the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had unconstitutionally failed to provide such treatment. The complaint also alleged that the RSH patients were unconstitutionally subjected to insufficient staffing, lack of security (which allowed residents to inflict physical harm on themselves or each other), lack of care for personal hygiene, use of isolation rooms, insufficient sleeping space, lack of sanitation in living/sleeping areas, unpleasant odors, and unsanitary kitchen and laundry facilities.</p><p>The defendants made no reply to the plaintiff's complaint, but on April 27, 1976, the defendants asked the district court to dismiss the complaint.  On July 8, 1976, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Judge Edward Skottowe Northrop) dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiff had no authority to bring the lawsuit.  U.S. v. Solomon, 419 F.Supp. 358 (D.Md. 1976).  The plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On October 12, 1977, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge Harrison Lee Winter) affirmed the district court's decision to dismiss the case, holding that the plaintiff had no authority to bring the lawsuit.  U.S. v. Solomon, 563 F.2d 1121 (4th Cir. 1977).</p><p></p>",

Does the Attorney General of the United States without statutory\nauthorization have authority to bring suit against State officials to enjoin\nalleged deprivations of 13th and 14th Amendment rights of third parties?\n2. Has the Attorney General of the United States made sufficient\nallegation of injury in fact to its legal interests as to satisfy the require-\nments of standing?\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThis action has been brought by the Attorney General of the United\nStates against three public officials with responsibility for the care of\nmentally retarded clients at the Rosewood Hospital Center. Dr. Neil Solomon\nis the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and has the\noverall responsibility for all State health programs including State programs\non behalf of the mentally retarded. Bert Schmickel at the time of the filing\nof this action was the Director of the Mental Retardation Administration with\ndirect authority for programs in the area of mental retardation. Dr. Marvin\nMalcotti is the Superintendent of the Rosewood State Hospital (hereinafter\n\"Rosewood!') which is the subject of this suit.\niRosewood is a facility for the treatment and habilitation of the\nmentally retarded. The hospital is located in Owings Mills, Maryland, a suburb\nof Baltimore. Although Rosewood had 2400 residents at the time the complaint\nwas filed, the hospital census has now been reduced to about 1600 persons.\nThe State of Maryland has embarked voluntarily on a program to improve the\nquality of care and habilitation given to residents at the hospital.\n\n/\nf\n-- 2 --\nThe complaint alleges that conditions at Rosewood are such\nthat the rights of its residents under the 8th, 13th and 14th Amendments to\nthe Constitution have been violated. Nevertheless, no resident or guardian\nof a resident at Rosewood has joined this action as plaintiff or intervenor.\nWith exception of the amicus curiae brief filed on appeal by the Mental Health\nLaw Project on behalf of three organizations concerned with the mentally re-\ntarded, no organization representing the mentally retarded has participated\nin this case in any capacity. Although the Plaintiff has attempted to inject\nselected portions of the voluminous discovery into the argument on the legal\nquestions, no evidentiary hearing has ever been held in this matter and there\nare no findings of fact for this honorable court to review. This court must\ndeal with the important questions of authority and standing rather than the\nmerits of _his action.\nIn the proceedings before the District Court, the State moved\nto dismiss the action on the grounds that the United States lacked the auth-\nority and'standing to bring the action. Judge Northrop dismissed this action\nfor the reasons stated in his opinion, see Appendix at 11-40.\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nThe instant case raises grave questions concerning federal-\nstate relationships and the proper scope of the authority of the Executive\nBranch of the Federal government. As will be shown in this brief, the Attor-\nney Genera]. is attempting in this case to circumvent the clear and frequently\nexpressed will of Congress that the Attorney General not have the power to\ninitiate this type of suit against state officials.\nThe Congress of the United States has expressly rejected\nevery effort in the last 19 years to give the Attorney General statutory\n\n- 3 -\nauthority to bring an action such as the instant case. Onthe other hand,\nCongresshas given the Attorney General the authority to bring civil actions\nfor injunctive relief to enforce individual rights under the 13th, 14th and\n15th Amend_entsin a numberof special areas such as voting, public accomo-\ndations, desegregation, employmentand housing. Suchauthority has been close-\nly circumscribed by safeguards to protect the rights of defendants and to pro-\ntect the integrity of state government. All of the authority to enforce the\nprovisions of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendmentsis vested in the Congressof\nthe United States. Since Congresshas the exclusive authority to enforce\nthe 13th and 14th Amendmentsas well as the 8th Amendment,applicability of\nwhich to the states is basedon the 14th Amendment,see\nPowell v. Texas,\n392 U.S. 514 (1968), and Congress has denied the Attorney General the power\nto bring this type of action to enforce such rights, this case must be dis-\nmissed on the grounds that the Attorney General has no authority to bring\nthis suit._\nAlthough a non-statutory right to sue has been recognized\nto protect the proprietary or governmental functions of the United States, or\nto prevent interference with interstate commerce or the national defense, the\ngreat weight of authority has rejected the extension of such a right to the\nprotectionlof 13th and 14th Amendment rights of third parties.\nThe United States may not bring this action as a civil ana-\nlogue to the enforcement of two criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C., Sections 241 and\n242. Congress by statute has authorized private citizens, but not the United\nl\nStates, to bring civil actions analagous to 18 U.S.C., Sections 241 and 242.\nAdditionally, these criminal statutes prohibit conspiracies to deny the equal\nprotection of the laws on the grounds of race. The United States has made no\n\n- 4 -\nallegation of conspiracy to deny equal protection or of racially discrimina-\ntory action in this case.\nAs the United States has no statutory or constitutional\nauthority to bring this action, it stands in the sameposition as any private\nlitigant. Assuch it must allege sufficient injury to its owninterests to\nestablish its standing to bring suit in a federal court. The various \"in-\nterests\" recited in the Plaintiffs' briefs fail to establish such injury.\n\n-5-\nARGUMENT\nI. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NEITHER STATUTORY NOR INHERENT AUTHORITY\nTO BRING THIS ACTION.\nA. The Congress Of The United States Has Consistently Denied The\n_Attorney General The Power To Brin_ An Injunctive Action Against\nState Officials To Enforce The Rights Of Third Persons Under The\n13th And 14th Amendments Except In Very Narrow Circumstances Not\nHere Relevant. Congress Has The Exclusive Authority To Enforce\nThe 13th And 14th Amendments And Has Chosen To Do So By A Variety\nOf Other Mechanisms. Accordingly, The Attorney General Has No\nAuthority To Brin_ This Action.\nThe fundamental question at issue in this case is the authority of the\nAttorney GEneral of the United States, a part of the executive branch of the\nFederal government, to initiate, without the authority of a statute, suit for\ninjunctive relief against the officials of a state government for the enforce-\nment of 13th and 14th Amendment rights. The answer to this question can only\nbe found by careful analysis of federal executive authority, particularly in\nthe area of the enforcement of civil rights.\nThe landmark case on the question of executive authority is Youngstown\nSheet and Tube Co._ Inc. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), the so-called \"Steel\nSeizure Case.\" The primary issue in that case was whether the President of the\nUnited States had the authority to seize the nation's steel industry in an effort\nq\nto prevent a crippling steel strike during the Korean War.\nThe Court held that the seizure was beyond the powers of the execu-\ntive branc[h because the President had no statutory or Constitutional authority\nto seize tlhe steel mills. The power to do so could not be inferred from the\nstatutes, as Congress had declined to give the President such authority. Justice\nJackson and Justice Frankfurter wrote major concurrences which explained the\nrationale of the Court's decision. Justice Jackson's concurrence is of parti-\ncular importance because of the guidelines it established for the analysis of\nfederal power:\n\n-6-\n\"i. When the President acts pursuant to an express or\nimplied authorization of Congress, his authority is at\nits maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in\nhis own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In\nthese circumstances, and in these only, may he be said\n(for what it may be worth) to personify the federal\nsovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under\nthese circumstances, it usually means that the federal\ngovernment as an undivided whole lacks power. A\nseizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act\nof Congress would be supported by the strongest of\npresumptions and the widest lattitude of judicial\ninterpretation, and the burden of persuasion would\nrest heavily upon any who might attack it.\n\"2. When the President acts in absence of either a Con-\ngressional grant or denial of authority, he can only\nrely upon his own independent powers, but there is a\nzone of twilight in which he and Congress may have con-\ncurrent authority, or in which its distribution is un-\ncertain. Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference\nor acquiescense may sometimes, at least as a practical\nmatter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent\npresidential responsibility. In this area, any actual\ntest of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of\nevents and contemporary imponderables rather than on\nabstract theories of law.\n\"3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the\nexpress or implied will of Congress, his power is at its\nlowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own con-\nstitutional powers, minus any constitutional powers of\nCongress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive\npresidential control in such a case only by disabling\nthe Congress from acting upon the subject. Presidential\nclaim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive\nmust be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake\nis the equilibrium established by our constitutional\nsystem.\" 343 U.S. at 636-38\ni\nI\nJustice Jackson noted that the steel seizure had not taken place pur-\nsuant to a C:ongressional enactment, so that his first category was inapplicable.\nIn reliance upon the exhaustive history of labor legislation set forth in\nJustice Frarkfurter's concurrence, Idu., at 597-609, Justice Jackson also stated\ni\nthat the case did not fall within the second category because Congress' failure\nto legislate steel seizure powers did not result from Congressional inaction,\n\n-7-\nI\nacquiescence or inertia. Indeed, Congress had legislated mightily in the field\n_!\nof labor relations, but had expressly rejected the power to seize industrial\nI\nfacilities i_nd thereby interven]e directly in private business relationships.\nI\nCongress instead decided upon an entirely different approach to emergency\nI\nsituations, _.g., the so-called Taft-Hartley injunction which provided for an\ni\nI\n80-day cool-off period to permilt the resolution of strikes endangering the\nJ\nnational interest, see 29 U.S.C. Sections 178, 179, 180. The steel seizure\nl\ntherefore fit the third category. 343 U.S. at 640.\nIn reviewing the possible bases of executive power suggested by\n|\nthe United States in its argumJnt to the Court, Justice Jackson determined that\nthe executive had no inherent or constitutional power beyond that of Congress\nI\nto seize mills. Thus, although the command of the Army and Navy under the\ni\nConstitution was vested in thelPresident , the power to declare war and to raise\nb\nand support the armed servicesiwas reserved for Congress. Although the President\ni\nhas the duty to faithfully execute the laws, the laws themselves derive from\nCongress. _e_e, U.S. Constitution, Article i, Section i. Justice Jackson con-\ncluded that' the steel seizure was an improper exercise of power.\nNew York Times Co., v. United States_ 403 U.S. 713 (1971), in which\nthe Court held an injunction against publication of the so-called \"Pentagon\ni\nPapers\" to be unconstitutional, followed the reasoning of Youngstown. See,\nConcurring Opinion of Justice Marshall Id___aa.t 740; see also Concurring Opinions\nof Justice Douglas, Id___,a.at 720 and Justice White, Id___,a.at 730. As Justice\nAn excellent article by Peter D. Junger, Down Memory Lane: The Case of the\nPenta$on Papers, 23 Case-Western Reserve L. Rev. 3 (1971) argues persuasively\nthat New York Times Co. v. United States can only be understood as a separation\nof powers case rather than as a first Amendment case.\n\n-8-\nMarshall in particular noted, Congress had enacted legislation giving the\nexecutive branch the authority to prevent disclosure of classified material\nby the use of criminal sanctions. Civil injunctions had never been authorized\nand in fact had been rejected by Congress as an executive branch tool to pre-\nvent breaches of security. The Court had no authority to remedy what the\nexecutive branch felt to be a gap in the legislation, most particularly when\nCongress had expressly and conscientiously refused to fill that gap itself.\nIn an analysis of the instant case, two things must be determined:\n(1) into which of Justice Jackson's categories does this case fit, and (2}\nwhether there is a source of federal executive authority to act without con-\ngressional authorization.\nThe Attorney General has not alleged that it is acting under a\nstatute. Nor is this action based by necessary implication on any federal\nstatute. The various statutes, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396(c) and (d), 20 U.S.C.\nSection i_01 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. Sections 2661-2666, 2670-2677, referred to\nin paragraph ll of the Attorney General's complaint are appropriations statutes\nauthorizing the use of federal funds for the construction and oPeration of\nstate facilities for the mentally retarded. The references to these sections\nare only iLntended to serve as evidence of federal \"interest\" in the mentally\nretarded. See discussion infra. This action therefore does not fall within\nthe first category of Justice Jackson's analysis.\nIt is equally clear that this case does not fall within category\ni\nnumber 2 The area of civil rights and specifically the enforcement of various\nI\nportions of the Bill of Rights as well as the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments\n\n-9-\nare not areas in which Congress has exhibited \"inertia, indifference or\nacqulescence . On the contrary, the area of civil rights has seen substantial\nlegislative activity, see_e,generally, 42 U.S.C. 1971 et se_. and 18 U.S.C.\nSections 241-45, much of it concerned with the authority of the Attorney General\nof the United States to enforce the constitutional rights of citizens. Se____e,\n42 U.S.C., Sections 1971, 1973, 1974, 1987, 2000a-5, 2000b, 2000c-6, 2000e-6,\n2000h-2, 2000h-3, 18 U.S.C., Section 242.\nAs the filing of this action is clearly \"incompatible with the\nexpress or implied will of Congress\", se____ee,discussioninfra, the instant case\nfalls clearly within category 3 of Justice Jackson's analysis. From 1957 to\nthe present, the United States has undergone a virtual revolution in the en-\nforcement of the rights of minorities. In particular, landmark legislation in\nthe area of civil rights was passed in 1957, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1970 and\n1972. The power of the Attorney General in the area of civil rights enforce-\nment has been dramatically expanded. However, many proposals to expand the\nAttorney General's powers failed of passage, and what powers the Attorney\nGeneral has to initiate such action are circumscribed. A review of the legis-\nlative history of the various civil rights acts will demonstrate that Congress\nhas consistently rejected every effort to accord the Attorney General the\npower to bring the type of action represented by this case.\na. Civil Rights Act of 1957. The original version of the\nI\n2\nCivil Rights Act of 1957 contained a provision known as Title III, which\n2\n\"PART II] - TO STRENGTHEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\nSection 121, Section 1980 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1985) is amended\nby adding thereto two paragraphs to be designated fourth and fifth and to read\nas follows: 'Fourth.

Title\nIII was inserted in response to a request by Attorney General Herbert Brownell,\nthat he be given authority to seek civil remedies in the area of civil rights,\nremedies which Brownell felt were not available to him. Se____Lee,tter of\nAttorney General Herbert Brownell, H.R. Report No. 29, April i, 1957, U.S.\nCode\nCong. and Administrative News I 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 1957 vol. 2 at\n1979-80. Under this provision no individual party needed to be joined as\nplaintiff and there were no limits on the discretion of the Attorney General\nother than that he should have reasonable grounds to believe that a conspiracy\nto violate someone's rights was taking place. Title III was included in the\nversion of the bill which passed the House of Representatives on July 23, 1957,\nId. 1966-67.\nSerious questions were raised in the Senate as to the wisdom and\nconstitutionality of Title III. Among the more serious objections were:\ncontinuation of 3\nconspire, or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for\nthe purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any persons or class\nof persons of the equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and\nimmunities under the laws, or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the\nconstituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to\nall persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws;\nor if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or\nthreat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support,\nor advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any law-\nfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice-President, or as\na member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any citizen in person\nor property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case of conspiracy\nset forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause\nto be done I any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby\nanother is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and\nexercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the\nparty so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages,\noccasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the\nconspirators.\n\n-12-\n(i) that Title III abrogated the right to a jury trial in that conspiracies\nto violate civil rights which\nordinarily would be prosecuted criminally\nunder 18 U.S.C., Section 242 would instead under Title III be the subject\nof civil sanctions including contempt proceedings, (2)Title III would upset\nthe separation of powers between federal and state governments by permitting\nthe Attorney General to initiate broad-gauge attacks on state institutions.\nSee e.g0, i03 Cong. Rec. 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 12530-12565 (July 24, 1957).\nThe bill was amended to eliminate Title III, Id., at 12565, and the remainder\nof the bi).l was enacted by the Senate to become known as the Civil Rights Act\nof 1957, 102U.S.C., Sections 1971, 1975.\nThe 1957 Act was not silent on the question of the powers of the\nAttorney General. The Attorney General was given specific authority to seek\ninjunctiw_ relief to prevent interference with the rights of citizens to vote\nin federal elections. Thus, Congress denied the Attorney General the broad\npowers originally proposed and instead substituted a very narrowly drawn ex-\ntension of the powers of the Attorney General to initiate action.\nb. Civil Ri6hts Act of 1960 . It had become obvious by 1960\nthat the 11957 Act was inadequate to protect the rights of minority citizens.\nA number of civil rights bills were introduced and assigned to a special\nHouse Subcommittee which recommended a bill to the House Judiciary Committee.\ni\nH.R. 3147, the bill reported to the House Judiciary Committee, contained a\nmodified!version of Title III of the 1957 Act (indeed, the provision was Title\nIII of H.R. 3147 and was referred to as such). The modified Title III would\nhave permitted the Attorney General to initiate a civil action for equitable\nrelief if' he first received a written complaint from a person whose equal\nprotection rights were violated. Thereafter, the Attorney General would have\n\n-13-\nhad to certify that the said person wasunable to protect his ownrights.\nA civil action would be possible without written complaint against any persons\nattempting to hinder state or federal officials from carrying out court orders.\nSee HouseReport No. 956 (Aug. 20, 1959).\nU.S. Code Con_. and Admin. News r\n86th Cong., 2nd Sess. 1960, vol. 2 at 1954. The modified Title III was\neliminated from the bill, H.R. 8601, which was reported to the House by the\nJudiciary Committee and which ultimately passed in the House, Id., at 1939.\nDuring the floor debate in the Senate on H.R. 8601, an amendment\nwas offered by Senator Case of New Jersey which would substantially have\nreincorporated Title III into the legislation. After vigorous debate, se___ee.g.,\n106 Cong. Rec. 86th Cong., 2d Sess., (March I0, 1960) at 5151-5182 the amend-\nment was defeated, Id., at 5182.\nThe 1960 Act did address itself to the role of the Attorney General\nin civil rights proceedings by making minor changes in 42 U.S.C. Section\n1971(c) permitting an action to be brought directly against a State. Section\n1971(e) also created certain ministerial duties for the Attorney General when\na suit under Section 1971(c) was found to be meritorious by a court.\nc. The Civil Rights Act of 1964. In response to the racial\ni,\ncrisis oflthe early 1960's, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an Act substantially\naltering the relationship between the federal and state governments, was\nenacted.\nI\niThe House version of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, H.R. 7152 was\nassigned to a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee for analysis.\nThe version of H.R. 7152 which the subcommittee recommended to the Judiciary\nCommittee contained as Title IIIa provision authorizing the Attorney General\nto initiate civil actions or to intervene in ongoing civil actions to enforce\n\n-14-\nthe equal rights protection of the 14th Amendment.

Id. at 2393, 2411.\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy's remarks in opposition to that\nportion of' Title III which was deleted are of some note in the context\nof the instant case. He stated in testimony before the Judiciary Committee\nthat:\n\"Title III would extend to claimed violations of\nconstitutional rights in State criminal pmoceedings\nor in book or movie censorship; disputes involving\nchurch-state relations; economic questions such as\nallegedly confiscatory rate-making or the constitut-\nional requirement of just compensation in land ac-\nquisition cases; the propriety of incarceration in\na mental hospital; searches and seizures; and con-\ntroversies involving freedom of worship, or speech,\nor of the press.\nObviously r the proposal in_ects Federal\nexecutive authority into some areas which are not\nits legitimate concern and vests the Attorney\nGeneral with broad discretion in matters of _reat\npolitical and social concern.\" Id. at 2450\n(emphasis added)\nThe AttorneY General in the instant case claims to have without congressional\nauthoritylmore power than the then Attorney General thought could wisely be\ngranted his office by an act of Congress.\nThe 1964 Act as passed contained the provision permitting interven-\ntion in all equal rights cases provided that the Attorney General certify\nthat the case was of general public importance.

The complaint\nfiled must be signed by the Attorney General or the Acting Attorney General\nand must state facts showing a pattern or practice of resistance. Actions\nbrought under 2000a-5(a) may be heard by a three-judge court. See 42 U.S.C.\nSection 2000a-5(b).\nAction under 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000b(a) and 2000c-6(a) may not\nbe initiated except upon written complaint to the Attorney General from per-\nsons whose rights are being violated. Thereafter, the Attorney General must\ndetermine (a) that the complaint is meritorious, (b) that the complainants\nwould be unable to maintain an appropriate legal action on their own and (c)\nthat the action would materially further the attainment of the desegregation\nof the particular type of institution. Sections 2000b(b) and 2000c_6(b)\ndefine inability to maintain an action as (i) the inability to bear the\n\n-16-\nexpenses of litigation, either personally or through an interested person or\n(2) the fear that such litigation would jeopardize the personal safety,\nemploymentor economicstanding of the complainant or his family or property.\nAssumingthat a person wasin criminal contempt of court for violating\nan injunction resulting from a civil action brought by the Attorney General\nor from an intervention by the Attorney General, the accused would have a\nright to a jury trial. The sentence could not exceed 6 months imprisonment\nor a $1,000 fine. See 42 U.S.C. Section 200Oh. Although the powers of the\nAttorney General were increased greatly by the 1964 Act, that portion of the\noriginally proposed bill which might have authorized the Attorney General to\nbring the instant case wasnot even reported out of committee.\nd.\nThe Votin$ Rights Act of 1965. The Voting Rights Act of\n1965 was designed to protect the 14th and 15th Amendment rights of minorities,\nand led to a substantial increase in the involvement of the federal government\nin state governmental processes. The power of the Attorney General in par-\nticular was expanded enormously in the area of the enforcement of 15th Amend-\nment rights.\nThe thrust of the Voting Rights Act was to avoid where possible the\nnecessity of court action to enforce voting rights. An effort was made to\nreverse tPLe burden of producing evidence by the establishment of presumptions\nof violations of rights based on percentages of non-voters in various states.\nThus, undE_r 42 U.S.C., Section 1973b(b), the Attorney General is directed to\ndeterminelwhich states have literacy tests or other devices which could be\nf\nused as instruments to interfere with the exercise of voting rights. The\nBureau of the Census would thereafter have to determine whether fewer than\n50% of the voting age population in such states were registered to vote. Such\na dual determination would serve under 42 U.S.C. Section 1973b(a) to stop the\n\n-17-\nenforcement of such literacy tests or devices. If the Attorney General were\nto bring a civil action against the use of such tests or devices, a court\nwould authorize the appointment of federal election examiners, 42 U.S.C.\nSection 1973a, whocould register voters themselves, 42 U.S.C. Section\n1973e. If a state involved in such discrimination were to institute a new\ntest or device, the state would submit the proposed law to the Attorney\nGeneral. If he did not act within 60 days, the law could go into effect.\nIf he objected to the law on the grounds of its discriminatory effect, the\nstate could bring an action for declaratory relief in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. See42 U.S.C. Section 1973c.\nAspart of this comprehensiveschemeto protect voting rights, the\npoll tax in federal elections was prohibited, 42 U.S.C. Section 1973h(h),\nand the Attorney General wasauthorized to institute civil actions for injunc-\ntive relief to prevent enforcement of the poll tax. See 42 U.S.C. Section\n1973h(b). The Attorney General was also authorized under 42 U.S.C. Section\n1973j to eieekinjunctive relief against any effort to interfere with the\nenforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Suchactions must be heard by a\nthree-jud_:e court. See 42 U.S.C. Section 1973bb-2(a)(2).\n- j\nOne source of criti ism of the Voting Rights Act at the time of\nconsiderat_ion was that it would not serve to protect citizens from the use of\nphysical or economic coercion to prevent the exercise of voting rights, the\nrights tolcampaign for office, to hold meetings or to publish and speak in\nI\nfavor of _r against candidates or on public issues. See e.g., House Report\nNo. 439 (_fudiciary Committee} (June l, 1965) Additional Views of Rep. John\nLindsay {FI.NY}, U.S. Code Con_. and Admin. News r 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1965\nvol. 2 at 2483-84. Accordingly, an amendment to the voting rights bill was\n\n-18-\noffered on the floor of the House of Representatives authorizing the Attorney\nGeneral to bring civil actions for injunctive relief to prevent interference\nwith first amendment rights. The amendment was rejected by the House of\nRepresentatives. Se____iei,i Cong. Rec. 89th Cong., ist Sess. (July 9, 1965)\nat 16263-16265.\ne. Fair Housin_ Act of 1968. The Attorney General was\nauthorized in the Fair Housing Act to bring a civil action for injunctive\nrelief when he should find (a) pattern or practice of resistance to the full\nenjoyment of fair housing rights or (b) that any group of persons has been\ndenied such rights and such denial raises an issue of general public importance.\nSee 42 U.S.C. Section 3613.\nf. Votin_ Rights Act Amendments of 1970. The Voting Rights\nAct of 1965 was extended for an additional five year period in 1970 by the Voting\nRights Act Amendments. The Attorney General's power to initiate civil actions\nwas extended so that he could seek injunctions to prevent voting violations in\nstates where the 50% determination had not been made, or where improper re-\nsidency requirements were in effect, see 42 U.S.C. Section 1973aa-2. He could\nalso bring actions to enjoin enforcement of any state laws which prevented\npersons between 18 and 21 from voting. See 42 U.S.C. Section 1973bb-2. Under\ni\nboth Sections 1973aa-2 and 1973bb-2, such civil actions must be tried before\ni\ni\na three-judge court.\ng. Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. This Act sub-\nl\nstantial]y amended the equal employment opportunity provision of the 1964\nAct. Th4,1972 Act extended the Attorney General's authority in one area,\nthat is, the Attorney General was authorized to bring an action against a\nstate governmental agency on grounds of employment discrimination upon request\nby the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. See, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-5(f).\n\n-19-\nHowever, the 1972 Act substantially reduced the power of the\nAttorney Ceneral to initiate action to prevent employment discrimination.\nThe 1964 Act had authorized civil action by the Attorney General where a\npattern or' practice of employment discrimination existed, se___e42 U.S.C.\nSection 2000e-6(a). The 1972 Act added subsections (c}, (d), and (e) to\nSection 2000e-6 which transferred all the Attorney General's powers in this\narea to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In so doing, Congress\nin 42 U.S..C. Section 2000e-6(d} incorporated the procedures of 42 U.S.C.\nSection 2000e-5 into the prosecution of \"pattern and practice\" suits.\nSection 2000eZ5(b)mandates tMat the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nattempt to resolve employment discrimination cases by informal methods of\n\"conferences, conciliation and persuasion\" before suit can be brought.\nSections 2000e-5(b), (c) and (d) require the Equal Employment Opportunltles\nCommission to defer to state and local anti-discrimination procedures when\nsuch are available. Under Section 2000e-8(b} the Co_ission is authorized to\nenter into contractual relationships with state and local agencies by which\nthe Commission may agree to refrain from processing charges against the\nagency or. to exempt the agency from certain requirements in an effort to\npermit the agency to resolve its own complaints. Thus the 1972 Amendments\nby substituting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the Attorney\ni\nGeneral made a substantial change both in procedure and philosophy in dealing\nwith employment discrimination cases.\ni\nh. Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975. Congress has recently\npassed amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which make minor changes.\nThe protections of the 1965 Act are extended to Spanish-speaking citizens and\nthe Attorney General's authority under the Act is extended to reach such\n\n-20-\nI\ncitizens.\nSection 1973bb-2 is amended to reflect passage of the 26th\nI\nAmendment giving persons 18 years and over the right to vote.

Furthermore, in\n1964 such_a provision was rem >ved from the Civil Rights Bill while it was\nstill in committee, and in th most recent Congress, three such bills died in\ncommit teei_\n,Congress has substantially increased the powers of the Attorney\nGeneral i!n this period. Yet these increases have been carefully restricted as\ni\nto the subject matter and as to procedural safeguards. Thus, the Attorney\n,i\nGeneral is free to bring suit only in the areas of voting rights, public\naccomodation, public facilities, school desegregation and housing.\nThe Attorney General's authority to bring actions even in these areas\nhas been:circumscribed. In cases involving public accomodations, employment\ndiscrimination and voting rights, the Attorney General has to find a pattern\nor practice of denial of these rights before a civil action may be initiated.\n\n-22-\nIn cases involving state operated facilities and public schools, no action can\nbe initiated except upon written complaint of the victim of discrimination.\nAdditionally, the Attorney General has to find that the\nvictims were unable\nto conduct the litigation because of expense or fears for personal or economic\nsafety.\nThe Attorney General may not even intervene in an action under the\nequal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, despite the broad authority\nto do so, without certifying that the particular case is of general public\ninterest. Furthermore, actions brought under the public accomodations laws\nmay be heard before a three-judge court, and actions under the voting rights\nprovisions must be heard by a three-judge court. Criminal contempt actions\nbrought under any provision of the 1964 Act must be tried by a jury.\nThe 1972 amendments to the equal employment opportunities provisions\nof the 1964 Act are particularly significant in this context. Congress\neliminated the power of the Attorney General to bring an action upon the mere\nfinding oi\" a pattern or practice of discrimination. It instead substituted\nthe elaborate procedures of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which\nafford st_ite and local agencies as well as companies, unions, eta, every\nopportuni!;y to purge themselves of discrimination by conciliation, by contract\n]\nwith the ]EEOC, and by recourse to state and local procedures. In keeping with\nthis approach, H.R. 12230, 12008 and 2323 all provided for an opportunity for\nstate off![cials to be informed of violations and have a chance to correct\nrights violations before suit is brought. Congressional action thus demon-\nstrated great concern not to inject the federal government too boldly into the\noperation;of state and local institutions. Even the Justice Department's own\nI\nbills recognized the necessidy for harmonizing the protection of the institu-\n|\n\n-23-\n• I 4\ntionalized with the princlple of federalism.\nCongress has created a complex body of legislation for the enforce-\ni\nment of civil rights. Congress has had to pick and choose among various tools\nfor the enforcement of right_ to ensure both the maximum benefits to minorities\n1\nand the minimum injury to important principles of federalism and the separation\nI\nof powers. The bludgeon of _he use of the full power of the federal govern-\nment through the Justice Depar_menl\"t to enforce the provisions of the 14th\nr\nAmendment. was rejected in 1957, 1960, 1964 and 1965 in favor of other measures.\ni\nDespite the further opportun_tles to give the Attorney General broad powers\nin 1968, 1970, 1972, 1975, a!d 1976, Congress has chosen to legislate cautiously.\nIn 1972 Congress actually withdrew such powers from the Attorney General and\nI\nsubstituted procedures designed to minimize federal-state friction.\nI\nh\nThe Attorney General alleges that he has the inherent power to\nI\nbring actions such as the instant one absent statutory authorization whenever\nthe Attorney General in his discretion should find that the United States has\nan interest. If the Attorne_ General's position is. correct, the Congress of\np\nthe United States has been e_gaged in the incredible hoax over the last 20\ni\ni\n4 r\nThe United States has made much of Congressional passage of that portion\nof the budget of the Justice Department relating to the conduct of a\ngroup of suits including the instant case against a number of States.\nSe___B_reief of the United States at 22-25. The failure of the Congress\nto excise a $269,000 item involving 13 employees from a federal budget\nof over $400,000,000,000 involving millions of employees can hardly be\nsaid to reflect a change in a position of Congress so consistently held\nfrom 1957 to the present. The true indication of Congressional policy\nis the persistent refusal of Congress on each occasion in which the\nquestion has been presented to authorize the type of broad enforcement\npowe!?s the Attorney General now claims to possess. Se____Uen,ited States\nv. Solomon, App. at 25.'\n\n-24 -\nyears of passing legislation purporting to expand the Attorney General's\nauthority, when, in reality, such legislation was in fact limiting it. Thus,\nby passing 42 U.S.C., Section'2000b stating that the Attorney General may ini-\ntiate action against a non-educational state institution only if he receives\na written complaint, which complaint must seem meritorious, and if he finds\nJ\nthe complainant to be unable to bring the action because of fear of retaliation\nor lack of resources, Congress was imposing restrictions on the Attorney Gen-\neral's presently unfettered a_thority. Similarly, Attorneys General Brownell\nand Levy would seem to be seeking a reduction in their own authority when they\nsubmitted civil rights bills for consideration by Congress.\nThese conclusions are obviously absurd. Congress has been legis-\nlating vigorously over the last two decades to expand the degree of protection\nafforded to the rights of all of our citizens. The various civil rights acts\nare obviously grants of authority to the Attorney General which the Attorney\nGeneral had never had before. In light of the legislative history and the\nstatutory framework of the civil rights acts, the action of the Justice Depart-\nment in the instant case must be seen as an effort to aggrandize power which\nCongress had consciously denied the Attorney General. 5 The use of executive\n5The Justice Department has relied upon United States v.

Rec. 86th Cong. 2d. Sess. at 5151-5182 (March 10, 1960},\nand the committee reports in 1964, see, _._., House Report (Judiciary Commit-\ntee No. 914, U.S. Code Con_. and Admin. News, 88th Cong. 2d. Sess. 1964 vol.\n2 at 2392, demonstrates that Congress felt that the Attorney General did not\nalready have the power which was the subject of dispute.\n\n-25-\nauthority in this case is clearly and emphatically \"incompatible with the\nexpress or' implied will of Congress,\"\nYoungstown Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer t\nsupra at 638 and is squarely within category 3 of Justice Jackson's con-\ncurrence.\nUnder these circumstances, the power to initiate an action could\nbe exercised only if there were an independent Constitutional source of\nexecutive power in excess of that of Congress. Examination of applicable law\nmakes it clear, however, that such an independent source of executive authority\ndoes not exist. The 13th and 14th Amendments themselves vest all enforcement\npower in the Congress. See Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544\n(1969); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966); South Carolina v. Katzenbach\n383 U.S. 301 (1966). Thus Section 5 of the 14th Amendment provides:\n\"The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by\nappropriate legislation, the provisions of this\narticle.\"\nSection 2 of the 13th Amendment contains similar language. The vesting of\nenforcement power in Congress was not a capricious act. The 13th and 14th\nAmendments as well as the 15th Amendment_ which also vests enforcement power\nin Congress, were the first Constitutional provisions which directly impinged\nupon the internal authority of the states and theexercise of state power.\nThe power I_o enforce these amendments was therefore vested in Congress, the\nA\nonly branch of government which organically represents the states of the\nI\nUnited States. Indeed at the time of passage of the amendments, Senators\nwere elected by state legislatures and not by popular election The structu_\ni\nof the Amendments is such that any encroachmentrupon state prerogatives and\npowers whic:h may occur through the three amendments would be only those en-\ncroachments authorized by the representatives of the states themselves. See\nAllen v. State Board of Elections,supra, at 562-63. The amendments represent\n\n-26-\nan effort to balance the rights of minorities with the principles of federalism.\nThe three amendmentswere designed to ensure that state governmentswould pro-\ntect the rights of minority citizens, not to substitute federal authority for\nstate authority. Enforcement powerwas reserved to CongressbecauseCongress\nrather than the executive branch, could be relied upon to be sensitive to the\nneeds of state government.\nSince no power to enforce the provisions of the 14th Amendmenbty\nthe executive branch exists within the 14th Amendmenittself, to bring this\naction at all the Attorney General mustehowthat it has constitutional power\nwhich derives from a source outside the 14th Amendment. Furthermore, such\npower must be sufficient to justify a change in the relationship betweenthe\nfederal a!ndstate governments which Congresshas consciously declined to make.\nAsJudge Northrop noted below, a \"most severe\" burden is placed upon the\nexecutive branch to showan independent source of authority where the executive\nintends to act contrary to the wishes of Congress in areas in which Congress\nhas the exclusive constitutional enforcement authority.\nJudge Northrop rightly held that the United States had not met that\nburden. In particular, he held that the duty to \"take care that the laws be\nfaithfully executed\" U.S. Constitution Art. II, Section 3, cannot serve as\nan excuse to contravene or go beyond the laws established by Congress. This\nI\"\nduty'.. ;.isa duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve\nmore than Congress sees fit to leave within his power,\" Youngstown Sheet and\nTube v. _iaw_, supra at 610 (Frankfurter, J. concurring} quoting Myers v. United\nI\nStates, _!7_ U.S. 52 {Holmes, J.). Clearly, this provision would not permit the\nexecutive branch to act contrary to the wishes of the Congress which makes\nthe laws.\nJustice Frankfurter's concluding remarks in Youngstown are appro-\n\n-27-\npriate here:\n\"It is one thing to draw an intention of Congress\nfrom general language and to say that Congress\nwould have explicitly written what is inferred,\nwhere Congresshas not addressed itself to a\nspecific situation. It is quite impossible, how-\never, whenCongressdid specifically address it-\nself to a problem as Congressdid to that of\nseizure, to find secreted in the interstices of\nlegislation the very grant of powerwhich Congress\nconsciously withheld. To find authority so\nexplicitly withheld is not merely to disregard\nin a particular instance the clear will of Congress.\nIt is to disrespect the whole legislative process\nand the constitutional division of authority between\nPresident and Congress.... 'Balancing the equities'\nwhenconsidering whether an injunction should issue,\nis lawyer's jargon for choosing between conflicting\npublic interests. WhenCongressitself has struck\nthe balance, has defined the weight to be given the\ncompeting interests, a court of equity is not\njustified in ignoring that pronouncementunder\nthe guise of exercising equitable jurisdiction.\"\nYoungstown Sheet and Tube. Co. v. Sawyer, su_,\nat 609-10 (Concurrence of Frankfurter, J._\nCongress has struck the balance in the area of enforcement of the\n13th and 14th Amendments by its creation of a wide range of remedies including\nprivate civil suits, administrative proceedings, conciliation_ and a broad\nbut limited authority on the part of the Attorney General of the United States\nI\nto seek injunctive relief. The Attorney General's action in bringing this\naction is a bald effort to assert authority where there is none, and unilater-\nally to establish a new balance between public interests in contravention of\nthe balance established by Congress.\n\n- 28 -\nB. Any Right Of The United States To Sue In The Absence Of Express\nStatutory Authorization To Do So Is Limited To Cases In Which It\nSeeks To Protect Its Proprietary Or Governmental Functions Or To\nPrevent Interference With Interstate Commerce Or The National\nDefense. The Great Weight Of Authority Has Rejected The Extension\nOf Such A Right To The Protection Of 13th And 14th Amendment Rights\nOf Third Parties.\nThe foregoing argument should not be understood as denying\nthe United States the power to bring suit without statutory authorization in\nthe proper circumstances. Indeed, such a right has long been recognized, see,\n_._.,Du_an v. United States, 16 U.S.(3 Wheat.) 172 (1818).

United States Klans r supra; held that the United States\nhad standing to sue both under the interstate commerce clause of the Consti-\ntution, aind alternatively under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.\nHowever, an analysis of Deb._sand the line of cases following Deb____l_esnds no\ni\nsupport ti3 Brand Jewelers.\nI.\n1 In re Debs was an action brought by the Attorney General\nagainst the leadership of various railroad unions to enjoin acts of violence\nI\nresulting from the Pullman Strike of 1894. The case was appealed to the Supreme\nCourt on ,grounds that the Attorney General did not have the authority to bring\nthe action.\nJ\nThe rationale of Debs is unclear, and in light of modern con-\nditions it is problematical _hether the Supreme Court would arrive at the same\n\n-32-\nconclusion today if such a case again were to be presented. The SupremeCourt\n!\nbegan its analysis by noting _hat the power to regulate interstate commerce\nJ\nrested with Congress, and tha Congress had made use of that power by legisla-\ntion. The national governmen_ therefore had the authority to prevent obstruc-\ntions to interstate commerce. Although Congress had the power to prevent ob-\nstruction by the use of crimi_'al penalties, the Court stated that, in cases of\nemergency, authority clearly e_isted to maintain order by the use of federal\ntroops if necessary. The Cour I then asked rhetorically why, if troops could be\n[\nused, a peaceful alternative, _._. an injunction, could not be used to equal\neffect. [\nThe Court an lyzed in great detail the common law powers of\nL\na Court of equity to abate public nuisances at the request of governmental\ni\nagencies. The Court defined the difference between a public nuisance and a\ni\nprivate as that the \"one affects the public at large and the other simply the\nin6ividual.\" F_uitable powers had frequently been invoked to prevent inter-\nference with commerce on navigable rivers which are the property of the govern-\n/\nment as custodian of the right_ of the public at large. Since railroads were\nr\nanalogous to rivers as the gre_t highways of commerce, the government had the\n' i\nsame duty an'd power to main tainIthe free flow of commerce on the railroads as\non the rivers.\n: The test for'authority to bring suit was stated as follows:\n: \"...While it is not the province of the govern-\ni ment tolinterfere in any matter of private controversy\nbetweenlindividuals_ or to use its great powers to\nenforcelthe rights of one a_ainst the other, yet,\nwhenever the wrongs complained of are such as af-\nfected the public at large, and are in respect of\nmatters lwhich by the Constitution are entrusted to\ni\nthe care of the Nation and concerning which the\nNation owes the duty to all the citizens\n• I\nsecurlng them their common rights, then the mere\n\n-33-\nfact that the overnment has no pecuniary interest\nin the controversy is not sufficient to exclude it\nfrom the courtls or prevent it from taking measures\ntherein to fully discharge those Constitutional duties.\"\nId. at 586 (e_phasis added) .\n|\nThus, three factory must be present to authorize suit. (1) The wrongs\ncomplained of must affect the public at large. (2) The wrongs must be in respect\nq\nof matters entrusted by the Constitution to the care of the national government.\nii i     _   _ ovteo oent/-must\nThe language of Del_s clearly refers to wrongs comparable to public\nM\nnuisances, e.g., obstruction_ of navigable waterways, in which the injury is\n-- !\nto the community as a whole nd not to individuals. The Court in Debs quoted\n/\napprovingly language from it_ earlier decision in United States v. San Jacinto\nTin Co., 125 U.S. 273 (1888)': \"...if it is apparent that the suit is brought\nfor the benefit of some thir'd party, and that the United States has no pecuniary\nl\ninterest :£n the remedy sough , and is under no obligation to the party who will\nbe benefited to sustal\"n an ac_t't_on for his use in short, if there does not\nt\nappear any obligation on the part of the United States to the public or to any\nindividua&, or any interest of its own, it can no more sustain such an action\nthan any private person could under similar circumstances,\" 125 U.S. 273, 285\nquoted atl158 U.S. 564, 584-585. Thus, In re Debs, despite the expansiveness\ni\nof its ru'ling lends no support to the concept that federal power may be invoked\nwithout the aid of a statute for the redress of individual rights.\nThe successors to In re Debs, with the exception of Brand Jewelers,\nhave consistently applied the Debsdoctrine to cases either involving burdens\non interstate commerce usually in the nature of a public nuisance, or to cases\nI\ndirectly involving an interest of the United States. The early successors to\n\n-34-\nDebs involved specialized situations. In Sanitary District of Chicago v. United\nStates, supra, the United Sts_es sought an injunction to prevent a water pro-\nl\nject which would reverse the Iflow of a navigable river. Robbin__._sv___U.nited State._s,\n!\naffected.\nwas not involved, a propriet4ry interest of the United States was\n!\nThe greatest use of In re Debs was made in the early 1960's. In a\n4\naccomodation facili-\nline of cases arising out oflefforts to desegregate public\nI\nties, it was held that the violation of 14th Amendment equal protection rights\nI\nin public transportation facilities constituted a burden on interstate commerce.\nI\nSe____Uenited States v. City oflJackson r supra; United States v. City of Shreveport,\nJ\nsupra; United States v. Lasslter, supra; United States v. City of Montgomery,\nsupra; United States v. Unitld States Klans, supra; United States v. State of\nl\nMississippi, 229 F. Supp. 925, (S.D. Miss. 1964), (3 judge court,Brown , J.\nI\ndissenting), rev'd, 380 U.S. Jl28, (1965). An additional group of cases held\nt\nthat violations of the 14th Amendment constituted burdens on the national defense.\nSee Unite'd States v. Arlin_t n County, supra; United States v. Brittain, supra.\nJ\n\" Of special interest is United States v. City of Jackson, supra,\n(heavily;'relied upon in Bran Jewelers)in which Judge Wisdom made the often-\nL\nquoted comment:\n,' \"When the act, on of a state violative of the 14th\nAmendment conflicts with the Commerce Clause and\ncasts more than a shadow on the Supremacy Clause\nthe United Sitates has a duty to protect the 'in-\nterest of al_.' The Courts offer the first avenue\nfor counteralction by the Nation. Such thinking may\ntake us downl the road to recognition of Government\nstanding to _ue under the 14th Amendment or under\nany clause of the Constitution.\"\nHowever, he went on to say:\n\n-35-\n\"The Issue here is framed by the CommerceClause.\nUnder that clause there is authority for the\nUnited States to sue without specific congressional\nauthorization.\" 318 F.2d at 14.\nRehearing was requested and denied in\nUnited States v. City of Jackson,\nsupra. Because of the potentially expansive reading which could have been given\nto the case due to Judge Wisdom's treatment of the non-statutory standing issue,\nI\nthe other two judges specifically dissociated themselves from his opinion and\nfound instead that sufficient statutory authorization existed. As Judge Northrop\nnoted, City of Jackson represents no real expansion of the Debs principle.\nUnited States v] Solomon t App. at ll-12.\nIn applying In re Debs to a 14th Amendment case, the District Court\nin Brand Jewelers not only gave a more expansive reading of the case than has any\nother court, but also gave amore expansive interpretation than the language of\nthe original decision permits. A careful analysis of Brand Jewelers shows how\nthis was done. After holding that the widespread deprivations of due process\ninvolved {[n \"sewer service\" constituted a burden on interstate commerce, a holding\ntenuously within the Debs principle, but see, United States v. Solomon, App. at\n22-27, the court held in the alternative that standing existed under the 14th\nI,\nAmendment, itself. The court achieved this result in an interesting manner. At\nI,\n1299 of t:ae opinion, the Deb_.__t_esst {quoted herein supra, at 32-33} is para-\nphrased r_ther than quoted as:\n\"an obstruction of broad impactt suf.ficient in its\ndimensions to be thousht 'public' rather than 'private:\ncausing or threatening injury of such moment as to\nbring fairly into play the National Government's\n'powers and duties to be exercised and discharged for\nthe general welfare...'\" (emphasis added)\nI\nBy its Paraphrase, the court effectively changed the test. Debs required that\na wrong affect the \"public at large,\" not that it be \"of broad impact, suf-\nficient in its dimensions to be thought 'public r rather than 'private'.\" A\n\n-36-\nsmall scale impact on interstate commercewould be a wrong against the public\nat large for the purpose of Deb__a_n_ds,conversely, a large scale deprivation\nof other rights maynot be a wrong against the public at large.\nFurthermore, in Deb.__fse,deral action was justifiable when\n(I) the wrong is in \"respect of matters which by the Constitution are entrust-\ned to the care of the Nation\" and (2) \"the Nation owesthe duty to all citi-\nzens of securing them their commonrights.\" The test as stated in\nBrand Jewel-\ners focused on the quantity o_ the wrong and asked if the injury was of such\nmoment as to bring federal power into play and whether the injury touched upon\npowers and duties exercised for the public interest. Debs focused on the qual-\nity of the wrong, and required that the wrong be in an area in which citizens\nhave common rights and in which the Nation owes a duty to all citizens.\nHaving misstated the test, the District Court proceeded to the\n14th Amendment analysis. The court stated that it could see no basis for dis-\ntinction between the \"authority of the Attorney General to protect against large\nscale buri_ens on interstate commerce from his authority to protect against large\nscale denials of due process.\" 318 F. Supp. 1300. There Would be no such dis-\nI\ntinction if Debts were read as referring only to the scale of such deprivations.\n'i I\ni\nHowever, _eb___sand the cases following it have consistently followed a public\ni\nnuisance ;interpretation of federal authority, and have therefore distinguished\nbetween burdens on interstate commerce however small and other types of consti-\ntutional violations.\ni\n, The lack of statutory authority in Brand Jewelers was disposed\nof handily by the comment that \"the failure of Congress to take positive action,\ni\nsometimes a matter of moment', is hardly the equivalent of a negation.\" 318 F.\nSupp. at 1300. However, Congress has clearly acted to negate any such power\n\n-37-\nin the Attorney General. Se___ediscussion,supra. There is no indication that\nthe court in Brand Jewelers took any notice of the legislative history of the\ncivil ri_ts acts.\n'i\nBrand Jewelers is an anomaly, probably motivated by the judge's\n,i\nsympathy for the victims of a vicious scheme, rather than by consideration of\nthe fine ]_egal questions involved. The case is legally unsound, and contrary\nto the ow_rwhelming weight of authority. Judge Northrop properly rejected the\nauthority of Brand Jewelers as should this court.\n\n-38-\nC. The Right To Brin_ A Civil Action On Behalf Of The United States Cannot\nBe Inferred From The Criminal Civil Rights Statutes.\ni\ni,\nThe Attorney General in reliance upon dicta appearing in that portion\nof the opinion to which Judge Tuttle alone subscribed in In re Estelle, 516 F.2d\nI\n480, 486-87 (5th Cir. 1976) _ert. den. 96 S. Ct. 2637 (1976), (Rehnquist, J.\ndissenting), argues that thelUnited States has a civil cause of action to re-\ni\ndress 14th Amendment violations, inferrable from the criminal civil rights sta-\ntutes, 18 U.S.C., Section 24iand 242\nJudge Tuttle's dicta is clearly inapplicable to the instant case and\nis in any event legally incorrect. Section 241 addresses iSself to conspiracies\n:i\nto violate civil rights. There is no conspiracy alleged in this matter. Section\ni\n. i\n242 addresses itself solely to violations based on alienage, race or color.\nL\nThere is no such discrimination alleged in this case.\n,I\nEven if the instant case were analogous to the situation described\ni\nin the criminal statutes, no civil action can reasonably be inferred. The\np\nlack of a comparable statutorily authorized civil action on behalf of the\nUnited States was no accident. A private right of action does exist under the\nCivil Rights laws, se___4e2, U.S.C., Section 1983, but Congress has consistently\nrejected any extension of such powers to the Attorney General. The government\nbrief at 32 notes that under the criminal statutes the United States would have\nto prove criminal intent and'such an element of proof would make the government's\ni\ntask more difficult. The Defendant would note that the necessity of a jury trial,\nthe higher burden of proof, and the entire panoply of constitutional protec-\ntions for the rights of the criminally accused would also come into play and\nwould also complicate the goyernment's task. These complications may well be\nI\nthe reason why Congress has 6hosen to confine the United States to criminal ac-\ntions, rather than extending the Attorney General's authority to.the more easily\n\n- 39 -\nconducted civil action. See103Cong. Rec. 85th Cong., Ist Sess. 12530-12565.\nCf. 42 U.S.C., Section 2000h_\nWyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, supra, upon\nwhich Judge Tuttle relies, clearly explains the circumstances in which a civil\nt\nI\naction can be inferred from _ criminal statute on behalf of the United States\n!\nor any other party. (I) Th interest of the plaintiff must fall within the\nl\nzone of interests that the statute was intended to protect. (2) The harm which\noccurred must be of the type which the statute was intended to forestall. Clear-\nly, the United States was not intended to be the beneficiary of Sections\nf\n241 or 242, nor has the United States alleged that it was harmed in any manner\ncontemplated by Sections 241 and 242. Both sections seek to protect individuals\nagainst the denial of equal }rotection. By comparison, the statutes in Wyan-\ndott___seought to protect the Inited States from injury to interstate commerce.\nIn any event, a civil actionl could hardly be inferred from a criminal statute\nwhen Congress had expressly _ejected the civil action sought to be inferred.\nSee discussion, supra.\nIn conclusion we would note Justice Rehnquist's comments in\ndissent in In re Estelle, supra, at 2639, in which he was joined by Chief Jus-\nf I\ntice Burger and Justice Powell:\n\"But the United States surely has no claim of its\nown under the Fourteenth Amendment which it may\nassert against petitioners, and the rather pallid\nbrief of the United States in opposition to certiorari\nis discreetly silent as to the source of any such\n'claim.' 42 U.S.C. Section 2000h-2, which author-\nizes intervention by the Attorney General in an\naction seeking relief from the denial of equal pro-\ntection of the laws 'on account of race, color, reli-\ngion, sex or national origin...,' clearly affords\nno basis for intervention by the Government on the\npleadings before the District Court. The Solicitor\nGeneral's brief also refers to the fact that the\n\n- 40 -\nUnited States has statutory responsibility for enforc-\ning 18 U.S.C. Sections 241 and 242, 'the criminal\ncounterpart to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983,' but it would\nseem unlikely that respondent or any other District\nCourt could grant intervention for the reason that\nthe proposed intervenor wished later to institute\ncriminal proceedings against one of the parties to a\ncivil action. In its memorandum in support of its\nmotion to intervene in the District Court, the United\nStates urged that it had 'inherent standing to sue to\nenjoin widespread and severe deprivations of constitu-\ntional rights. In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895).'\nIf Deb____sw,hich held that a federal court had author-\nity to issue an injunction against an armed conspiracy\nthat threatened the interstate transportation of the\nmails, is to be extended to the situation presented by\nthis case, I think the decision to do so should be\nmade by this Court.\"\n\n-41 -\nII. THEUNITEDSTATESHASFAILEDTOALLEGETHATIT HASSUFFEREIDNJURYTOA\nLEGALLYPROTECTEINDTERESTSOASTOESTABLISHITS STANDINGTOBRINGTHIS\nACTION.\nASthe United States has brought this action without the bene-\nfit of a statute, the United States must, like any other litigant, justify its\nstanding to sue.\nAs was stated in United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125\nU.S. 273 1888):\n\". . .If it is apparent that the suit is brought\nfor the benefit of some third party, and that the\nUnited States has no pecuniary interest in the\nremedy sought, and is under no obligation to the\nparty who will be benefited to sustain an action for\nhis use; in short, if there does not appear any ob-\nligation on the part of the United States to the\npublic or any individual, or any interest of its own,\nit can no more sustain such an action than any private\nperson could under similar circumstances.\"\nAn analysis of standing must begin with a review of the alle-\nI\ngations w!]ich appear in the United States' s petition. Se_._e,Sierra Club v. Morton,\n405 U.S. IT27 (1972). Paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of the Petition set forth the\nallegations upon which the Petitioner must rely to establish its standing to\nbring suit in this action. Paragraph 11 states that the proper treatment and\nI\nhabilitation of the mentally retarded is \"a matter of direct concern to the\nUnited Sti_tes.\" As evidence of such concern, the Petition cites the President's\nI,\nstatement on Mental Retardation of November 16, 1971, the Social Security Act,\ni\n42 U.S.C., Section 1396(c) and (d)(relating to Medicaid payments for certain\n!.\nservices), the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1401 et. se_.\n(relating to federal appropriations to the States for the establishment of ed-\nucational programs and facilities for the education of handicapped persons) and\nthe Devell)pmental Disabilities Services Facilities Construction Act, 42 U.S.C.\nSection 2661-2666, 2670-2677c (relating to appropriations to the States for the\ni\n\n-42-\nI\nestablishment of programs and facilities for the developmentally disabled).\n,i\nIn addition to the allegations of the complaint the United States\nadditionally has argued that:'under 18 U.S.C. Sections 516-519, mention of\n.f\nwhich does not occur in the petition, the Attorney General is appointed the\nofficer with the authority to conduct litigation for the United States in\nthose cases wherein the United States has an \"interest.\" See Brief for the\nI\nUnited States at lO. As Sections 516-519 serve only to appoint a lawyer\nrather than to define what cases may be brought, see, United States v. Daniel,\nUrbahn r Seelye and Fuller, 357 F.Supp. 853 (N.D. Ill. E.D. 1973), the United\nStates attempts to demonstrate an \"interest\" in mental retardation sufficient\nto establish standing.\n'Three \"aspects\" of'the case are cited which, it is argued, \"in\ncombination, give rise to a litigable interest on the part of the United\nStates.\" Brief for the United S_ates at 14. These aspects are: (1) statutory\nenactments of Congress establishing a national policy regarding the protection\nI\nof the mentally retarded, (2) federal tax funds spent in programs for the men-\ntally reti_rded at Rosewood, Which are conditioned upon certain standards of\nI.\ntreatment, and (3) the interest of the federal government to vindicate syste-\nmatic deprivations of 13th and 14th Amendment rights. The third aspect has\nbeen treated fully in this brief already, se___e,discussion supra. The amicus\ni\ncuriae brief of the Mental Health Law Project generally supports the interest\nI\nof the Un'ited States and further states that the treatment of the mentally\nI\nretarded nationally is poor, and that there are insufficient legal resources\navailable privately to vindicate the rights of the retarded.\nUpon analysis, all of the various grounds alleged by the United\nStates as to its \"interest,\"iwith exception of the enforcement of the\n\n- 43 -\nterms of the receipt of fede _al funds, fail utterly to meet evenminimal stand-\nards for the recognition of standing. See_._.\nSchlesin_er v. Reservists to Stop\nthe War, L_18 U.S. 208 (1974); United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 (1974);\nUnited States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669 (1973); Sierra Club v. Morton, supra; Asso-\nciation oi' Data Processin_ Services Or_anizationst Inc. v. Camp1 397 U.S. 150 (1970).\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962).\nThe one exception, the enforcement of the terms of federal\ngrants, m!ght justify standing, see DefendantS' Brief, supra, at 28. How-\never, unless the government's brief on appeal is to be construed as an amend-\nment to the petition in this:matter, the petition itself is utterly lacking in\nreferences to state violations of the terms of any contract or grant with the\nfederal government. Indeed, paragraph I of the complaint simply states:\n\"The United States alleges as follows:\n\"I. This is a civil action commenced by the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States for the purpose of enjoin-\ning serious and widespread violations of the rights\nsecured to residents and potential residents of the\nRosewood State Hospital, Owings Mills, Maryland, by\nthe Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution. This Court has\njurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. 1345\nand the Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution.\"\nThe discovery, negotiation and argument in this case have not\nfocused ol violations of federal regulations, or contractual obligations.\nFurthermore, as Judge Northrop points out in his opinion, such violations of\nregulations are more properly redressed by the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfar_e than by the Attorney General. Se___e,United States v. Solomon, App.\nI\nat 34. i\nQuite clear'ly, if standing is to be found it must be found\n\nL\n- 44 -\nwithin the four corners of the petition in the allegations that Congress and\nthe President have declared a national interest or policy in the mentally re-\ntarded an4 that no other enforcement mechanism exists.\nThe test for standing as it has been repeatedly stated is\nwhether t!]e complaining party has \"alleged such personal stake in the outcome\ni\nl\nof the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the\npresentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumina-\ntion of difficult constitutional questions.\" Baker v. Carr, supra at 204. The\n\"personal stake\" specified in the Baker v. Carr test has come to refer to some\nconcrete injury to the protected interests of the specific complainant. Se__e\nI\nSierra Cl_ub v. Morton, supra. Generalized complaints as in a bare allegation\nr\nof injury to \"federal policy and the national interest\" are insufficient.\nIndeed, the Court in Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the\nWa..._rs,upr._, indicated that:\n\"Concrete injury, whether actual or threatened is\nthat indispensable element of a dispute which serves\nin part to cast it in a form traditionally capable\nof Judicial resolution . . This personal stake is\nwhat the Court has consistently held enables a complain-\nant authoritatively to present to a court a complete\nperspective upon the adverse consequences flowing from\nthe specific set of facts undergirding his grievance.\nmoreover. . the requirement of concrete injury\nfurther serves the function of insuring that such\nadjudication does not take place unnecessarily .\nFirst, concrete injury removes from the realm of specu-\nlation whether there is a real need to exercise the\npower of judicial review in order to protect the\ninterests of the complaining party . . .Second, the\ndiscrete factual context within which the concrete\ninjury occurred or is threatened insures the framing\nof relief no broader than required by the precise facts\nto which the Court's ruling would be applied. This is\nespecially important when the relief sought produces\na confrontation with one of the coordinate branches of\nthe _overnment; . . .\" Id. at 220- 22Z\n\n-45-\nAnecessary corollary of the requirement of a concrete injury\nis that a party maynot sue to redress the violations of the rights of third\nt\nparties, see\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, (1975}. Although the standing of\nthird parties has sometimes been recognized to protect the interests of their\ni\nmemberships, such parties were required to have some immediate nexus with the\ninterests of the membership.! See Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (1953);\nj.\nPierce v. Society of Sisters', 268 U.S. 510 (1925). Such a nexus is necessary\nI\nr\nto insure proper representation of the interests of the patties whose rights\nI\nhave been violated, ii\nThe policy is well _illustrated in this case. No resident oP Rosewood\nnor any family member of a resident nor any organization to which a resident\nor family member belongs is a party in this matter. No resident or family\nmember or organization for the retarded has any control over the conduct\nJ\nof the suit, the relief requested, the definition of issues, possible terms of\ni °\nsettlement, trial strategy and tactics. Yet the residents of Rosewood will\nf' i\nhave to _ive with any changes wrought by an order issued by the District Court,\nor by any, settlement agreement between the Justice Department and the Defendants.\nii\ni\nI\nJ\nI\nJ\n1\ni,\n\n-46-\nThe position of the United States in this litigation is similar\nto that cf the Sierra Club in\nSierra Club v. Morton, supra. The Supreme\nCourt said of the Club: \"The Sierra Club is a large and long-established\norganization, with a historic commitment to the cause of protecting our\nNation's heritage from man's depradatlons. Id. at 739. Yet the Sierra\nClub was dismissed because the mere existence of \"special interest\" in an\narea did not suffice to establish standing.\nNothing the Attorney General has alleged in this matter amounts\nto more than a subjective \"special interest\" of the United States in the\nrights of the retarded.\nThe reliance of both the United States and the Mental Health Law\nProject cn the \"Bill of Rights for the Mentally Retarded,\" 42 U.S.C. Section\n6010, to establish more than subjective interest is misplaced. The conference\nreport, House Conference Report No. 94-473, 1975 U.S. Code Con_. and Admin.\nNews at 961, quoted by the United States, Brief of the United States at 19,\nand by the amicus curiae, Brief of Amicus Curiae, at 22, does indicate that\nthe rights of the retarded set forth in 42 U.S.C. Section 6010 must be protected\ni\n\"by the Congress and the cou_ts.\" Reference to 42 U.S.C. Section 6012, enacted\ni\nas part of the same legislation as the \"Bill of Rights for the Mentally Re-\ntarded,\" will serve to explain the ambiguous reference to the courts in the\nconference report. Section 6012 reads as follows:\n\"The Secretary shall require as a condition to\na state receiving an allotment...that the State\nprovide the Secretary satisfactory assurances\nthat not later than such date (1} the State will\nhave in effect a system to protect and advocate\nthe rights of persons with developmental dis-\nabilities anld (2) such system will (A) have the\n• [\nauthorlty to pursue legal, administratlve and other\n• ] . • r\napproprlate _remedles to insure that protectlon of the\nrights of such persons who are receiving treatment, services\n\n-47-\nor habilitation within the State, and (B) be\nIndependent of any State agencywhich provides\ni°\ntreatment servlces, or habilitation to persons\nwith developmental disabilities .... {b}(1). To\nassist state_ in meeting the requirements of sub-\nsection (a),Ithe Secretary shall allot to the\ni\nStates the sums appropriated under paragraph (2}.\"\nFar from supportin the government's position, this federal statute\nmakes clear the Congressiona_ policy that the States must enforce the rights\nof the retarded through Stat advocacy a_encies. The federal role is to\nfinance the State advocacy p _ogram. There is clearly no expression in this\nlegislation of an \"interest\" of the United States which the Attorney General\nis to enforce by way of suit On the contrary, the expressed interest of the\nUnited Sta•tes is to permit St!ate authorities to serve as advocates for the\nmentally retarded.\nThe cases relied u on by the United States in support of its con-\ni\ntention that it may bring suit where federal policy has been established\nI\nthrough legislation are inapposite. Uni.t_ed States v. Sanitary District of\nChicago, supra; United State v. Republic Steel; supra, and Wyandotte Trans-\n!\nportation Co. v. United Stat s_ supra, were all based upon the United States'\ni I\npower to i_egulate interstate commerce and upon the Rivers and Harbors Act of\ni\ni\nwhich the ,United States, as owIner of all navigable waterways, is the primary\nbeneficia!!y. See, Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, supra. United\nq\nStates v. _Rock Island Centenn'ial Brid_e Commission, supr__a,was brought to en-\nforce the conditions of a federal construction grant. United States v. Ira\nS. Bushey & Sons r Inc., 346 F.Supp. 145 (D. Vt. 1972) was based upon the power\nof the federal government under federal common law to abate a public nuisance\naffecting navigable waterways'. In each of these cases, proprietory or govern-\nmental interests of the United States were injured by the alleged wrongdoing.\n\n-48-\nOnefinal point t_ be addressed is the contention of the amicus\ncuriae that standing should be granted becausethere would be inadequate\nresources available to the mentallyretarded to protect their rights should\nJudge Northrop's opinion be sustained. The law is clear that the lack of\nalternati_re remedies does not confer standing to sue. See,United\nStates v.\nRichardson, supra, at 179. This is true even if the counsel for the party\nseeking standing is capable of presenting able argument and briefing. See,\nSchlesin_er v. Reservists to Stop the War, supra, at 225. However, even if\nthe lack of resources could confer standing, it is clear that at least in\nMaryland the mentally retarded have been ably represented in a number of\nsuits. See, Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens_ Inc. v. Solomon_ Civ.\nNo. N-74-228 (D. Md. filed March 6, 1974); Maryland Association for Retarded\nCitizens v. Maryland, Civ. No. 72-733-M (D. Md. filed July 19, 1972); Bauer\nv. Mandel, Docket 30,Folio 61, File 22871 (Cir. Ct. of Anne Arundel County,\nfiled Sep{.ember ll, 1975); Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens v.\nDepartment of Health and Mental H_iene, Docket i00, Folio 182, File 77676\n(Cir. Ct.for Baltimore County, decided for plaintiff, May 3, 1974). Further-\ni\nmore, thelimplementation of federally funded state advocacy programs under42\nU.S.C. Section 6012 will go far towards securing adequate resources for the\n!\nrepresentation of the mentally retarded. Accordingly, there is no need for\nthe United States to exercise the role it has claimed for itself in this area.\ni\n' CONCLUSION\nI,\n'For the reasons herein stated, the decision of the District Court\ni\ni\nshould be affirmed.\n\n-49-\nFrancis B.

ADDENDUM A\n2., • - _ ,, _ ._\n_- - _ 5->\"\nZSNf \nFebruary 18, 1976\nv Tile Speaker\nHouse of Representatives\nWashington, D.C. 20515\nDear Nr. Speaker:\nEnc].osed for your consideration and appropriate reference\nis a legislative proposal \"To improve the administration of\nState institutions holding persons involuntarily confined,\nand for other purposes.\"'\nThe draft bill would authorize the Attorney General to\nbring suit to prohibit a State or its agents from pursuing a\n\"pattern or practice\" of denying the constitutional rights of\npersons involuntarily confined. However, that power could\nnot be exercised unless the State, after notice, had failed\nto correct the alleged constitutional violations within a • I\nreasonable time. The Attorney General would also have au-\nthority to intervene in cases of public importance challenging\nthe constitutionality of conditions in state institutions\noccupied by involuntarily confined persons.\nThis proposed legislation would operate to upgrade state\norison conditions. It would thereby help to eliminate the\ncurrent distortion in the sentencing process and the breeding\nof caree_ criminals which result from inhumane penal institu-\ntions. As the Presidentlobserved in his Crime Message of\nJune 19, 1975:\n_nen a defendant is convicted, even for\na violent crime, judges are too often un-\nwilling to impose prison sentence, in part\nbecause they consider prison conditions in-\nhumane. Moreover, a cruel and dehumanizing\npenal institution can actually be a breeding\nground for criminality. In any case, a civi-\nlized society that seeks to diminish violence\nin its midst cannot condone prisons where\nmurder, vicious assault, and homosexual rapes\nare common occurrences.\nThe draft bill would also require individuals involun-\nt._ril'/ confined in stat_ _nstitutions to exhaust any available\n.\n- 50 -\n\n-2-\n\"plain, speedy, and efficient state administrative remedy\"\nbefore bringing a civi_ rights suit in federal district\ncourt under 42 U.S.C. [983. The Supreme Court has inter-\npreted section 1983 to preclude federal courts from requir-\ning exhaustion of stateadministrative remedies. See\nSteffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 472, 473 (1974); Wilwording v.\nSwenson, 404 U.S. 248 (1971).\nP i\nA _jor purpose of the draft bill is to encourage States\nto adopt: effective inmate grievance procedures. Under current\nlaw, States have little incentive to establish such procedures\nbecause inmates can bypass them in filing section 1983 suits.\nAnother purpose of the draft bill is to reduce the burden\non the federal judiciary of prisoner suits brought under\nsection 1983. Such su£ts are currently being filed at an\nannual ]:ate exceeding 6,000, or approximately 5% of the civil\ncaseload of all federaldistrict courts. The overwhelming\nmajority of these suits are frivolous and many of the under-\nlying dJ.sputes could be satisfactorily resolved through ade-\nouate grievance machinery. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has\nhad i_mate grievance machinery in operation since April, 1974.\nApproximately 40% of the grievances filed have been resolved\nin favor of the inmate. I\ni\nIn addition, section 1983 suits filed after an unsuccessful\nadministrative hearing would be considerably easier to decide\nthan is typically the case now. The record created during the\nproceeding would sharpen the issues in dispute.\nIt should be stressed that the exhaustion requirement does\nnot den i, prisoners access to federal courts in section 1983\nsuits, lit requires only the \"plain, speedy and efficient\"\nstate ac_inistrative remedies be exhausted before bringing\nsuch suits. A prisoner unsatisfied with the administrative\ndecisio_l would be permi tted to file a section 1983 suit.\n[\nThe Office of Mana _ement and Budget has advised that there\nis no objection to the Isubmission of this proposal and that\nit would be in accord w [th the program of the President from\nthe standpoint of the _inistration's program.\nSincerely,\nAttorney General\nEnclosure\n- 51 -\n\nI\nADDENDUM B\ni', '\nR 12230'\n• • ' , ,lil:.i\n; ' ,! i ', ,ll //\nn ' i !, _n _i . _1 II I\nIN TIIE ]IOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n' '.l!l]',' I I_' l'_\n]_[^m:n9, 1976\nMr. Iiom_o (by request) introduced the following bill ;.which Waft'l'oferred\nto the Connmitte_ on tim .ludiciary\n_ \"- 'Jl ' I : t II,\n• ' :',1 ',ll ' \" l=\nA BILL\nTo impr.vc Ihe adminlsl.ral,i.nl of Sl:alc i.sLitul,lons I!ohling per-\n.

Pennhurst, Civil\nNo. 74-1345 (E. D. Pa. filed May 30, 1974) numerous\nofficials of the Department of Public Welfare\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as well as\na State School and Hospital for the mentally retarded\nare named as defendants. The plaintiffs allege\na deprivation of their claimed constitutional\nrights to treatment and to treatment in the least\nrestrictive manner possible. In the Halderman\naction the United States of America was granted\nleave to intervene as a party plaintiff to vindicate\nthese asserted rights. Subsequently, defendants\nMotion to Dismiss the United States of America\nwas denied.\nThe precise issue raised by the defendants\nin the Halderman action involvesthe legality of\nthe United States' participation as an intervening\nparty. While the intervention issue is not of\ndirect concern to this Court, the paramount issue,\n-2-\n\nthe authority of the United States to participate\nin, and initiate such litigation, is central to\nboth cases.\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania contends\nthat the United States of America has absolutely\nno independent interest sufficient to initiate an\naction seeking to remedy alleged deprivations\nof Constitutional rights, absent specific Congressional\nauthorization. To hold otherwise would ignore\nthe well established constitutional principles\nof case or controversy set forth in Article III,\nSection 2 of the United States Constitution, and\nwould constitute a serious disruption of the\ndelicate balance of federalism, long preserved\nand honored by the federal judiciary. Cf. Rizzo\nv. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976).\n-3-\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThis actionwas initiated on February 21,\n1974 by the United States of America, through\nits Attorney General. The complaint alleges that\nthe mentally retarded _esidents of Rosewood State\nHospital, a facility operated by the State of\nMaryland, are being denied their claimed constitu-\ntional rights under the Eighth, Thirteenth, and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Con-\nstitution.\nOn April 27, 1976, defendants moved to dismiss\nthe complaint on the ground that the United States\nhad no power or authority to initiate this action.\nAfter extensive briefing, in which the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania joined as amicus curiae, the Honorable\nEdward S. Northrop dismissed the complaint and\nentered judgment accordingly on July 8, 1976.\nThe opinion of the lower court is reported at\n419 F. Supp. 358 (D. Md. 1976).\nThe United States of America brought this appeal\non September 3, 1976\n-4-\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THROUGH ITS\nATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NO AUTHORITY TO INITIATE\nTHIS ACTION.\nThe United States of America, through its\nAttorney General, has been an active litigant\nin a number of recent cases concerning the rights\nof institutional individuals. 1 The fact that\nthe United States is participating in, or in fact\ninitiated, these actions can not be doubted. The\nissue framed in the instant case is the constitutional\npropriety of the United States' participation in these cases.\n1\nIn the mental health field these cases include:\nWyatt v. Stickney, 334 F. Supp. 1341 (M. D. Ala.\n1971); 344 F. Supp. 373, 344 F. Supp. 387 (M.\nD. Ala. 1972) aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt,\n503 F. 2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974) (United States appointed\nas litigating amicus curiae; question of standing\nnot in issue); North Carolina Association for\nRetarded Children v. North Carolina, No. 3050\n(E. D. N. C.) (United States is plaintiff-intervenor;\nunknown whether question of standing in issue);\nUnited States v. Kellner, No. 74-138 (D. Mont.\nfiled November 8, 1974) (United States is plaintiff;\nquestion of standing raised, and United States\ndismissed), Horacek v. Exon, 357 F. Supp. 71 (D.\nNeb. 1973) (United States is plaintiff-intervenor;\nquestion of standing raised; Motion to Dismiss\npending), Halderman v. Pennhurst, No. 74-1345 (E.\nD. Pa. filed May 30, 1974) (United States is plaintiff-\nintervenor; question of standing raised; Motion to\nDismiss denied).\n-5-\n\nUnquestionably, the power to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United states Constitution\nrests with the Congress. \"The Congress shall\nhave the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,\nthe provisions of this Article\" (Amendment 14,\nSection 5). However, there is absolutely no general\nlegislative authority emanating from the Congress which\nallows the Attorney General of the United States to remedy\ndeprivations of the constitutional rights claimed in\nthis case through civil litigation seeking injunctive\nrelief. Indeed, as amply demonstrated by the Court\nbelow, existing legislative authorizations for the\ninvocation of executive power in enforcing various\nCivil Rights Acts have been carefully defined and\nare limited in scope. United States v. Solomon,\n419 F. Supp. 358, 370-72 (D. Md. 1976). Therefore, the United\nStates possesses no general authority to institute cases\nlike the present one.\nAlthough no Congressional authorization\nexists for the civil enforcement of the Fourteenth\nAmendment by the Attorney General, the United States\ninsists that its criminal enforcement duties (18 U.S.C.\n-6-\n\n_§241 and 242) implicitly encompass the broad civil\nenforcement powers it now claims 2. In its Brief the\nUnited Sta%esmerely relies on these statutes and the\nreasoning of Judge Turtle alone in In re Estelle,\n516 F. 2d 480 (5th Cir. 1975) cert. den. U.S.\n96 S. Ct. 2637 (1976) for the proposition that\nwhen criminal prosecution wouid be ineffectual,\n2\n18 U.S.C. S_241 and 242 provide:\n$241. If two or more persons conspire to injure,\nopress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in\nthe free exercise of enjoyment of any right or\nprivilege secured to him by the Constitution or\nlaws of the United States, or because of his having\nso exercised the same;...\nThey shall be fined not more than $i0,000 or\nimprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and\nif death results, they shall be subject to inprisonment\nfor any term of years or for life.\n§242. Whoever, under color of any law, statute,\nordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects\nany inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District\nto the deprivation of any rights, privileges,\nor immunities secured or protected by the Constitution\nor laws of the United States, or to different\npunishments, pains, or penalties, on account of\nsuch inhabitant being an alien, or by reason or\nhis color, or race, than are prescribed for the\npunishment of citizens, shall be fined not more\nthan $i,000 or imprisoned not more than one year,\nor both; and if death results shall be subject\nto imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\n-7-\n\nthe Attorney General may seek an alternative civil\nremedy (Brief for the United States at pp. 31-32).\nBut the United States relies too much on Judge\nTuttle's analysis. Even accepting the argument that\nthe existence of an apparant overlap between these\ncivil (42 U.S.C. §1983) 3 and criminal (18 U.S.C. §§241\nand 242) sections implies a Congressional intent to\nconfer civil enforcement power on the Attorney General,\nnevertheless, the argument is inapplicable here.\nSection 241 relates only to conspiracies for\ndeprivation of the rights of citizens. Yet, no\nallegation of conspiracy is made in the present\ncomplaint, nor is any attempt made to state a cause\nof action under 42 U.S.C. _1985. Section 242\nrelates only to deprivations of rights by reason\nof color or race. And again there is no allegation\nin this complaint which even suggests any deprivation\non account of color or race. Thus while Judge\n42 U.S.C. §1983 provides:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage,\nof any State or Territory, subjects, or causes\nto be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction\nthereof to the deprivation of any rights,\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to\nthe party injured in an action at law, suit\nin equity, or other proper proceeding for\nredress.\n-8-\n\nTuttle's, and the United States' views, may be\ncorrect in the limited context of a case alleging\neither a conspiracy to deprive a citizen of his\nrights or a deprivation of rights due to race\nor color, there is nothing in the wording of the\ncriminal statutes that is even applicable to this\ncase.\nIn a number of cases relied on by the United\nStates, including Wyandote v. United States, 389\nU.S. 191 (1967); United States v. Republic Steel\nCorporation, 362 U.S. 482 (1960); Sanitar_ District\nof Chicago v. United States, 266 U.S. 405 (1925);\nand United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125\nU.S. 273 (1888) the Supreme Court has held that\nif criminal or other remedies authorized by Congress\nare inadequate, theUnited States, through its\nAttorney General, may seek other relief. But\nthese cases provide no support for the United\nStates' contentions here. In each of these instances\nwhere the Supreme Court countenanced some alternative\nform of relief, the purpose was clearly to allow\nthe United States to protect rights of the United States qua\nUnited States, pursuant to Article I, Section 8,\n-9-\n\nclause 3, or pursuant to some existing property\ninterest. In each of these cases the United States\nwas a proper party before the Court in the first\ninstance, and the Court merely invoked its inherent\npowers to fully remedy a controversy between leqally\ninterested parties one of which happened to be the\nUnited States. In this case, however, the United\nStates has no independent interest in the controversy.\nBeyond an admirable concern over the conditions of state\nmental facilities throughout the nation, the United\nStates has no independent interest in the specific\nconditions at Rosewood. Therefore, invocation of\nUnited States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., supra, and\nsimilar cases is misplaced here.\nIn addition, the United States relies on\n28 U.S.C. 55164 as providing authority for their\ninitiation of this action (Brief for the United\nStates at p. 10). Section 516 simply empowers\n28 U.S.C. §516 provides:\nExcept as otherwise authorized by law, the\nconduct of litigation in which the United\nSStates, an agency, or officer thereof is\na party, or is interested, and securing\nevidence therefore, is reserved to oZficers\nof the Department of Justice, under the\ndirection of the Attorney General\n-10-\n\nthe Department of Justice to conduct litigation in\nwhich the United States is a party or is interested.\nThe section merely identifies who shall act as counsel\nfor the United States in litigation. Thus, in\nthis case, the United States, as a party, is represented\nby its Attorney General. That is the complete scope\nand effect of Section 516. It says no more. There is\nno basis on which to conclude that Section516 was meant\nto grant \"standing\" to or empower the United States to\ninitiate suit when it is not otherwise a proper litigant.\nA broader construction would do violence to the clear\nmeaning of the statute which, based on its legislative\nhistory, must be strictly construed. United States v.\nDaniel, Urbahn, Seel[e and Fuller, 357 F. Supp. 853\n(N. D. Ill. 1973).\nThis statute does nothing more than grant\nthe Attorney General the sole authority to provide\nrepresentation for the United States in cases\nin which the United States has an interest. It\ndoes not and could not change the constitutional\nrequirement of standing. The mere fact that the\nUnited States is interested in a particular area\nof legal development does not confer upon it the\n\"interest\" required by the Constitution and necessarily\ncontemplated by Section 516.\n-ii-\n\nThe United States also raises the novel and\ndisquieting argument best described as implied\namendment of substantive Constitutional law by\nappropriation. The United States suggests that\nbecause Congress has appropriated money for the\nspecial litigation program of the Department of\nJustice, pursuant to which this action was brought,\nCongress has in effect given its imprimatur to the\nDepartment of Justice's activities. \"Surely he\nthat imagines this may imagine more.\" S. Johnson,\nRasselas r Poems & Selected Prose (New York 1958).\nAn annual appropriation is that and nothing more.\nThere is absolutely no basis on which to conclude\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to greatly\nexpand the Attorney General's enforcement powers\nin the civil rights area by this rather insignificant\nappropriation, which, by its own terms, is only\ntemporary.\n-12-\n\nThe Congressional appropriation to the special\nlitigation program confers no standing on the\nUnited States Attorney General to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment. Nor can it enlarge the\npower of the Attorney General beyond constitutional\nbounds. It is the duty of a federal court to assure\nthat every plaintiff possesses the standing to proceed.\nThat basic requirement can not be met by the United\nStates.\nII. THE UNITED STATES HAS NO STANDINGTO BRING\nTHIS ACTION\nGenerally\none party lacks standing to assert the\nrights of another. This principle applies to the United\nStates as well as every other litigant. Bailey v.\nPatterson, 369 U.S. 31 (1962); Brown v. Board of Trustees\nof La Grange Independent School District, 187 F. 2d\n20 (5th Cir. 1951); United States v. Biloxi Municipal\nSchool District, 219 F. Supp. 691 (S. D. Miss. 1963) ,\naff'd 327 F. 2d 929 (5th Cir. 1963); United States\nv. School District of Ferndale, Michigan,\n400 F. Supp. 1122 (E. D. Mich.\n-13-\n\n1975); 400 F. Supp. 1131 (E. D. Mich. 1975); and\n400 F. Supp. 1141 (E. D. Mich. 1975).\nClearly, the United States can not derive\nstanding itself from the asserted denial of the\nconstitutional rights of others. The United States\nmust show some impaired legally cognizable interest\nof its own to establish independent standing if\nit is to bring this action.\nThe interest manifested by the United States\nin the conditions at Rosewood State Hospital is\ncertainly not an interest in the conduct of interstate\ncommerce which is sufficient to confer standing\non the United States. 5 Nor does it constitute an interest\nin some property right of the United States, which would be\n6\nsufficient to confer standing on the United States.\n5\nIn re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895); United States\nv. Brand Jewelers, Inc. 318 F. Supp. 1293 (S.\nD. N. Y. 1970); United States v. City of Jackson,\n318 F. 2d 1 (Sth Cir. 1963); rehearing denied,\n320 F. 2d 870 (5th Cir. 1963); United States v.\nUnited States Klans, 194 F. Supp. 897 (M. D. Ala.\n1961); United States v. Lassiter, 203 F. Supp.\n20 (W. D. La. 1962)aff'd 371 U.S. i0 (1962).\n6\nUnited States v. New York Times, 403 U.S. 713\n(1971); Cotton v. United States, ii How. 229 (1851);\nUnited States v. San Jacinto Tin Com_an_, 125\nU.S. 273 (1888); Sanitary District of Chicago\nv. United States, 266 U.S. 405 (1925); United\nStates v. Bell Telephone Co., 128 U.S. 315 (1888);\nUnited States v. Fitzgerald , 201 Fed. Rep. 295\n(8th Cir. 1912).\n-14-\n\nOnly one case in the litany cited by the United\nStates arguably stands for the proposition that\nthe Attorney General, absent Congressional authorization\nhas standing to sue on behalf of citizens based on\nallegations of a widespread denial of constitutional\nrights. In United States v. Brand Jewelers, Inc.\n318 F. Supp. 1293 (S. D. N. Y. 1970), after an\nextensive discussion of the standing of the United\nStates to remedy burdens on interstate commerce,\nthe court held alternatively, in a single sentence\nand without discussion, that the United States\nhad standing to sue to end a widespread deprivation\nof property through state action, without due\nprocess of law.\nThis holding is ably criticized by the lower\ncourt, 419 F. Supp. at 365-66, as well as the\ncourt in United States v. School District of Ferndale,\nMichigan, supra. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\nas amicus curiae strongly supports these and other\nrecent holdings which thoughtfully reach a contrary\nresult. United States v. County School Board\nof Prince Geor@e Count_, Va., 221 F. Supp. 93\n(E. D. Va. 1963); United States v. Biloxi\nMunicipal School District, 219 F. Supp.\n691 (S. D. Miss. 1963) aff'd on other grounds\n-15-\n\n326 F. 2d 237 (5th Cir. 1964), cert. den. 379\nU.S. 929 (1964); United States v. Madison County\nBoard of Education, 219 F. Supp. 60 (N. D. Ala.\n1963), aff'd on other grounds 326 F. 2d 237 (5th\nCir. 1964), cert.den. 379 U.S. 929 (1964).\nThe United States is thus left only with\nits \"direct concern\" for the treatment and rehabilitation\nof the mentally retarded as evidenced by various\nfederal appropriations in this area. (Brief for\nthe United States at p. 16) There is, however,\nno allegation in the complaint that such\nappropriations are being misused. The only issue\nraised by the complaint is an alleged deprivation\nof constitutional rights. To derive standing\nfrom the bare fact that federal appropriations\nexist in the area would effect an unusual and\ndangerous mutation on the doctrine of standing.\nIf standing is found on the basis of the\nfederal governments' financial involvement in\nan area, the united States, unlike any other\nlitigant would have the extraordinary power to challenge\nany act of a state or local government which may\nallegedly violate some constitutional right, so\n-16-\n\nlong as some federal expenditure was involved.\nThe United States would be able to question, despite\nthe clear \"case or controversy\" dictates of the\nConstitution, a wide variety of state and local\ngovernmental actions. And, the fundamental relationship\nof co-existing sovereignty between the federal\ngovernment and the several states which was constitutionally\ncreated and judicially preserved would be destroyed.\nRizzo v. Goode, supra.\nThe concern expressed by the United States is,\nto be sure, appreciated by the recipients of its\nlargess. But that concern does not rise to the\nmagnitude necessary to invoke the federal judicial\npower over a recipient state defendant.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons and authorities, the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Connecticut\nas amici curiae respectfully urge this Court to affirm\nthe order of the District Court.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDeputy Attorneys General\nJ.

NElL SOLOMON, et al.,\nDefendant-Appellees\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland\nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES\nThe briefs of the defendants and the States of Texas,\nPennsylvania and Connecticut as amici curiae do not alter\nthe issues as presented in the opening brief of the United\nStates, i.e., despite the district court's casting its\nopinion in terms of the Attorney Generals \"authority,\"\nlittle can be said to suggest that the Attorney General\ndoes not have authority to represent the \"interests\" of\nthe United States in court, and whether this suit will lie\ndepends upon the presence of governmental interests sufficient\nto provide standing.\nf\n\n-2-\nNO ACT OF CONGRESS HAS TAKEN AWAY THE ATTORNEY\nGEb_RAL'S AUTHORITY TO REPRESENT TH_ INTEREST\nOF THE UNITED STATES\nThe thrust of defendants extensive recitation of the\nhistory of civil rights legislation is that Congress,\nbecause it granted certain power to the Attorney General\nand withheld others must have intended to forestall all\nsuits by the Attorney General in the broad category of\n\"civil rights\"not specifically covered by the enacted\nlegislation. (Brief, pp. 5-27)\nUndoubtedly, Congress did not want to grant the Attorney\nGeneral power to bring suits against \"any acts or practices\nwhich would give rise to a cause of action pursuant to\n[42 U.S.C. 1985].\" / Such a grant of power would allow suits\nby the United States, inter alia, against conspiracies\n\"...for the purpose of depriving, either directly or in-\ndirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protec-:\ntion of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under,\nthe laws...\" / But, to refuse such sweeping authority is not\nthe same as taking away the long recognized authority of the\n_/ Defendants' brief, p. 9, fn. 2, Part III of proposed\nCivil Rights Act of 1957.\n_/ 42 U.S.C. 1985 (3).\n\n-B-\nthe Attorney General to represent the interests of the\nUnited States in Court. 28 _.S.C. 516, 518(b) and 519.\nKern River Co. v. United States, 257 U.S. 147, 155 (]921).\nThe various acts described in defendants brief are\nimportant parts of Congress'efforts to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, but they represent, primarily$ an effort to\nestablish and enforce a national policy toward ending racial\ndiscrimination in various areas, some of which are Thirteenth\nand Fourteenth _nendment matters, e.g. public school desegrega-\ntion, public facilities, and some of which are not, e.g.\nprivate employment, public accommodations and federally\nfinanced programs. They have nothing to do with \"due process\"\nrights, Eighth Amendment rights, the right to treatment of\nmentally retarded persons or suits to enforce those rights.\nThey could not, therefore, cast any light on Congressional\nintentions about the Attorney Generals authority in these areas.\nDefendants apparently recognize this in Part I B, pp. 28-\n29, and in Part II, p. 42, of their brief where it is implicitly\nconceded that the authority of the Attorney General to bring\nnon-statutory suits on behalf of the United States depends upon\nWhether there are \"interests\" which supply standing, not upon\nthe legislative history of defeated bills, or Acts and amend-\nments on an unrelated subject.\n\n-4-\nTHE UNITED STATES IIAS STANDING TO BRING\nTHIS SUIT\nPlaintiff would not attempt to restate the important\ngovernmental interests which give it standing toprosecute\nthis suit which are detailed in its opening brief. However,\nseveral points in reply should be made.\nFirst, despite the arguments to the contrary by defendants\nand the states amice, there is, as to the issues in this case,\nno distinction between a suit basediupon the power granted to\nCongress tc regulate interstate co_nerce, and a suit based\nupon the power granted to Congress to enforce the Thirteenth and\nFourteenth Amendments, assuming both involve the interests\nof the \"public at large,\" In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 586 (1895).\nEven though Defendants and amici insist on construing the\ncomplaint as one solely to enforce individual rights,\nit is more than that. Admittedly, the suit is one to protect\nthe constitutional rights of a class of persons. But it is a\n=lass of persons in whose rights the United States has a\n\n-5-\ndirect interest,_/ and that interest has been injured by the\nacts of defe_dants _;hich defeat the legislated intent of\nCongress to provide for the'treatment of the mentally retarded\nas well as injure our fundamental law. This suit seeks to re-\nquire that treatment.\nSecond, defendants concede that enforcement of the\nterms of the federal grants which they have received would\nprovide sufficient standing to bring suit. Brief, p. 43.\nThe terms of the grants they receive relating to the treat-\nment of the mentally retarded person_; in this case are found\nin 42 C.F.R. §249.12 (reproduced in Addendum B of opening\nbrief), regulations authorized by 42 U.S.C. 1396d(d) which\nrequires treatment and certain standards for the operation of\nRosewood.\nf\n/ We adhere to the view that governmental interests arise\nFrom all considerations described in,the opening brief, in-\neluding the criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242, which\ncover the same subject matter as this case. Defendants' Brief,\np. 38, misreads section 242 as applying only to \"violations _\nbased on alienage, race or color.\" The statute applies, how-\never, to willful \"deprivation of any rights, privileges or\nimmunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of\nthe United States\" as well as to the separate offense of sub-\njecting someone to different pains and penalties on account of\nrace, color or alienage. See U.S.v. Classic, 313 UoS. 299 (1941).\nSimilarly, defendants give the Equal Employment Opportunity\nAct of 1972 its most restrictive possible interpretation, Brief,\npp. 18-19, by saying the Attorney General's authority to file employ-\nment discrimination suits against state and local agencies exists\nonly upon referral from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-\nsion. Although, the issue is irrelevant here, the 1972 Act\n(Footnote continued on following page)\n\n-6-\nIt would be anomalous for the gs_vernment to be able\nto sue to enforce these regulations, but _able to sue to enforce\nthe constitutional rights that the regulations are designed\nto protect because it has no \"interest\" in the constitutional,\nas opposed to the regulatory, integrity of a particular grant:\nprogram.\nThe complaint alleges: \"the proper treatment and\nhabilitation of mentally retarded individuals is a matter\nof direct concern to the United States as evidenced by ...\nCongressional enactments such as sections 1905(c) and (d)\nof Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.\n1396d(c) and (d))...\" For the defendants to contend, in the\nface of these statutes and regulations relating to \"treatment\"\nthat the United States has no governmental interest, or that\nthe complaint is insufficient to allege an interest, in the\nright to \"treatment\" of the mentally retarded citizens of\nRosewood defies all prior meaning given to the term \"interest.\"\nMoreover, the presence of Congressional acts applying\nto this subject matter pu t this case squarely withinUnited\nStates v. Arlington County, 362 F.2d 929 (C.A. 4 1964) which\n/ (Footnote continued from preceding page)\n_dded authority in Section 707 to file \"pattern or practice\"\nsuits against state and local governments. Referral suits are\ncovered by Section 706. Whether \"pattern or practice\" authority\nvisa vis governmental units transferred to EEOC, or disappeared,\nor requires a referral, is the subject of more argument than\nshould be reproduced here.\n\n-7-\ndefendants gloss over as a suit involving the exercise •\nof governmeutal functions in the area of national defense.\nBrief, pp. 28, 34. In that case the court enforced by in-\njunctionthe Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act relating to\ntaxation of servicemen by local governments. The Act made\nno provision for injunctive suits by theUnited States. The\nact was passed by Congress pursuant to its power to \"provide\nfor the common Defense...; To raise and support Armies...;\nTo provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Govern-\nment and Regulation of land and naval forces,\"_/ but this\nCourt characterized it as a suit to enforce the government's\n\"policies and programs\" 362 F.2d at 932. Surely, the statutes\nand funding provided by Congress for the treatment of mentally\nretarded citizen are a program of the federal government sub-\nject to enforcement by suit.\nThird, defendants are incorrect in stating, Brief p. 29,\nthat \"six of seven district courts which have considered the _\nnon-statutory authority of the UnitedStates to bring suit\nto enforce Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights have\ndenied the government such authority.\" The only district court\nother than the one below to rule against the United States on\n_/ U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Section 8.\n\n-8-\nthe governmental interest in the rig_ts of institutionalized\npersons is the district cou_t for the district of Montana,\nUnited States v. Mattson, Civ. No. 74-138, reproduced as an\nappendix to defendants' brief; that decision, resting solely\non the authority of the opinion below, has been appealed. On\nthe other hand, the district court for the eastern district\nof Texas has ruled that the United States may intervene as\nparty plaintiff in Rui._z v. Estelle, Civil Action No. 5523\n(opinion unreported, but was the suhject of the attempted\nmandamus reported In Re Estelle, 516 F.2d 480 (C.A. 5 1975)\ncert. denied, 44 Law Week 5700), a ease involving systemic\ndeprivation_ of constitutional rights of inmates of a Texas\nprison. The district court for the eastern district of\nPennsylvania denied a motion of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\nto dismiss the United States as plaintiff-intervenor in\nHalderman v, Pennhurst State School and Hospital, Civil Acticn\nNo. 74-1345, November 30, 1976 (note@ in us brief of\nPennsylvania, p. 2.); a similar motion in Horacek v. Exon,\n(D. Neb.) Civil Action No. 72-L-299 was denied on January 4,\n1977. Both of these cases involve the rights of institutionalized\npersons. The court in Alexander v. Hall, 64 F.R.D. 152, 157\n(D. S.C. 1974) in permitting intervention as plaintiff by the\nUnited States in a suit such as this, ruled:\n\n-9-\nThe 7edera] governmenu has long had an\ninterest in the improvement of mental\nhealth facilities, the-maintenance of\nadequate training for professional personnel,\nand the administration of proper treatment\nfor mentally ill individuals. Substantial\nsums of federal money are expended annually\nin the area of mental health care under the\nMedicaid program, 42 U.S.C. §1396 et seq.,\nthe Medicare program, 42 U.S.C. §1395 et seq.,\nand the Community Mental Health Center Act,\n42 U.S.C. §2681 et seq.\nand further said:\nThe United States has nonstatutory authority\nto sue to remedy widespread and severe depriva-\ntions of constitutional rights. [citition\nomitted] _\nThus_ when the issue is stated more in terms of this\ncase, the district court count _ould, arguably, be four to\ntwo against defendants. There are no appellate decisions\non this issue.\n- t\nThe inclusion of the four school desegregation cases by\ndefendant could not be more off the point. United States v.\nCounty School Board of Prince Geor_es County 221 F. Supp. 93 _\n(E.D. Va. 1963); United States v. Biloxi Municipal School\nDistrict, 219 F. Supp. 691 (S.D. Miss. 1963) and United States v.\nMadison County Board of Education, 219 F. Supp. 60 (N.D. Ala.\n1963) were all attempts by the United States to require\ndesegregation of school facilities operated by local authorities\nfor children of military personnel under an alleged contract\n\n-10-\n_hich providud federal money to local school districts.\nOn construction of the allg_d contract, the United States\nprevailed in the Prince Georges case and lost in the other\ntwo. United States v. School District of Ferndale, 406 F. Supp.\n1122 (E.D. Mich. 1975) involved interpretation of legislation\nauthorizing the Attorney General to sue to remedy discrimina-\ntion in education. The government did not claim it had\nauthority to remedy Fourteenth Amendment wrongs independent\nof the statutes. In each of these four eases, the statements\nof the district courts concerning the government's authority\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, are either unrelated to the\nprincipal issues in the cases or dicta. By way\nof contrast, United States v. Brand Jewelers, 318 F. Supp.\n1983 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) is squarely and emphatically an opinion\ncontrary to defendants' position.\nThe othc:r standing cases cited by defendant and the\nstates amici, e.g. Sierra Club Vo Morton, 405 UoS. 727 (1972)7\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), add nothing to the stand-\ning issue here. The plaintiff does not argue that it can assert\nthe rights of individuals, as such. This was made clear in\nUnited States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U.S. 273 (1888), as\ndefendant ably urges. Brief, p. 41. But the United States can,\nas was also _lade clear in San Jacinths, sue to protect the\nintegrity of governmental functions.\n\n-ll-\nFinally, the briefs of the states amici both raise a\nconcern about the effect of this suit on federalism, as\ndid the district court. Plaintiff agrees that this might\nbe a consideration when the merits of the case are decided\nand the equities are balanced. It would be a distortion of\nthis consideration, however, for it to control the pre-trial\nissue of standing to bring suit, and to defeat the interest\nof the United States before it can even be heard on the merits.\nIt would be an anomalous result if federalism would not :\ndefeat a suit by the United States to enjoin a local tax,\nArlington County, supra, would not defeat a suit to enjoin\na use of tolls over a toll bridge which would cost local\nauthorities millions in revenues, United States v. Rock Island\nCentennial Brid_e Co_ . ion, 346 F.2d 361 (C.A. 7 1964),\nwould not defeat a suit to enjoin use of Chicago's waste dis-\nposal system, Sanitary District of Chica_o v. United States,\n266 U.S. 405 (1925), but would defeat a suit to secure con-\nstitutional treatment for mentally retarded citizens that\nCongress has prescribed and paid for_ :\nr\n\n-12-\nCOECLUS ION\nFor the reasons stated-herein and in the opening brief,\nthe United States submits that the district court's judgment\nshould be reversed and the case remanded for trial.\nRespectfully submitted\nJERVIS FINNEY Jo STANLEY POTTINGER\nUnited States Attorney Assistant AttorneyGeneral\nLOUIS M.

The Complaint alleges\nthat the defendants' policies and practices have resulted in severe and widespread deprivation of the rights\nguaranteed by the eighth, thirteenth, and fourteenth amendments of the Constitution to residents of Rosewood\nState Hospital, Maryland's major facility for the residence of the mentally retarded.\nThe defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss, contending that the Attorney General has no authority or standing\nto bring this action on behalf of the United States. The states of Pennsylvania and Texas have filed amicus curiae\nbriefs in support of the defendants' position. Plaintiff, of course, sharply disputes the contention that it does not\nhave the authority and standing to prosecute this action.\nThe issue of executive authority which has thus been joined by this Motion to Dismiss has far-reaching\nimplications for the functioning of a system of constitutional, democratic government based on a balance of\npowers. See Estelle v. Justice, 426 U.S. 925, 929, 96 S.Ct. 2637, 49 L.Ed.2d 380 (1976) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting from a denial of certiorari). After exhaustive consideration of the relevant arguments and authorities,\nthis Court has reached the emphatic conclusion that the power of the executive branch of government does not\nextend to bringing a suit such as this one and that defendants' Motion to Dismiss should therefore be granted.\nBefore detailing the reasons for this conclusion, this Court wants to emphasize that it is expressing no opinion on\nthe merits of the underlying issue regarding the care and treatment of the mentally retarded in Maryland. The\nproper habilitation of mentally retarded citizens is a matter of acute concern to this Court, as indeed it should be\nto all decent and civilized persons. This Court has no doubt that the instant lawsuit stems from a benevolent\ndesire on the part of officials of the Department of Justice to improve the lot of the mentally retarded. Important\nand compelling as a charitable aspiration for helping the mentally retarded achieve a meaningful existence may\n\nbe, however, it must not be allowed to impel a procedural result which by implication, if not by direct effect, would\nthreaten the delicate balance of power which the Constitution conceives among the various branches of the\n362 federal government and between *362 the federal and state governments. This conclusion does not leave the\nmentally retarded without remedy for violations of their constitutional rights; it simply means that lawsuits aimed\nat protecting these rights must be brought by proper plaintiffs. It is noteworthy that several such lawsuits have\nbeen brought in recent years in Maryland. See Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Solomon, Civ.\nNo. N-74-228 (D.Md., filed Mar. 6, 1974); Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens v. Maryland, Civ. No.\n72-733-M (D.Md., filed July 19, 1972); Bauer v. Mandel, Docket 30, Folio 61, File 22871 (Circ.Ct. of Anne Arundel\nCounty, filed Sept. 11, 1975); Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens v. Department of Health & Mental\nHygiene, Docket 100, Folio 182, File 77676 (Circuit Court of Baltimore County, Maryland; decided for plaintiff,\nMay 3, 1974).\nThis, then, is not in any sense a decision about the rights and needs of the mentally retarded. It is a decision\nabout the proper limitation of the power of the executive branch of the United States Government.\nBasic to the philosophy of the American Constitution is the notion that the branches of the federal government\nhave no \"natural\" power, but only such power as is provided by the Constitution itself. See generally Hamilton,\nMadison, and Jay, The Federalist, included in Scott, The Federalist and Other Constitutional Papers (2 vol. ed.\n1894; 1 vol. ed. 1898). So central was this concept in the thinking of the founders of our country that they went to\nthe trouble of making it explicit by means of the ninth and tenth amendments of the Bill of Rights. Thus, the\ndiscussion of executive power in this case must start from the premise that the executive branch of the federal\ngovernment has no power and therefore no legal standing to bring this suit unless such authority can be found,\neither explicitly or implicitly, in the scheme of government laid out by the Constitution.\n[1]\nThe Constitution says nothing explicitly about the power of the executive to bring a suit before the judiciary.\nDespite this, there has never been much question that the Congress, in exercise of its delegated powers\n(particularly the \"necessary and proper\" powers of Article I, Section 8), can authorize the executive to sue. See,\ne. g., United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 27, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960). Indeed, such legislative\nauthorization abounds.\nIn the instant case, the government contends that Congress, by means of Sections 516 and 518 of Title 28 of the\nUnited States Code, has explicitly authorized the Attorney General to bring this suit. Section 516 is entitled\n\"Conduct of litigation reserved to Department of Justice\" and provides as follows:\nExcept as otherwise authorized by law, the conduct of litigation in which the United States, an\nagency, or officer thereof is a party, or is interested, and securing evidence therefor, is reserved to\nofficers of the Department of Justice, under the direction of the Attorney General.\nSection 518 is entitled \"Conduct and argument of cases\" and provides in pertinent part as follows:\nWhen the Attorney General considers it in the interests of the United States, he may personally\nconduct and argue any case in a court of the United States in which the United States is\ninterested, or he may direct the Solicitor General or any officer of the Department of Justice to do\nso.\nThese sections, however, do not grant authority to the Attorney General to bring an action concerning any matter\nin which he thinks that the United States might be \"interested.\" United States v. Daniel, Urbahn, Seelye and\nFuller, 357 F.Supp. 853, 858 (N.D.Ill.1973); see Allen v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 28 F.R.D.\n363 358, 362-63 (E.D.Va. 1961). The sections tell us nothing about *363 the nature of \"interest\" which will activate the\nAttorney General's discretion to act. These sections, therefore, constitute no authority on which to base a\nconclusion that Congress has explicitly authorized the executive to bring suits generally under the thirteenth and\nfourteenth amendments.\nThe Supreme Court long ago made it clear that the executive does have authority to bring suit in some situations\neven though the Constitution says nothing explicitly concerning such power and even though Congress has not\nexpressly granted such power. The first of such situations recognized by the Court involved the proprietary and\n\ncontractual interests of the federal government. Dugan v. United States, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 172, 4 L.Ed. 362\n(1818) (suit on a bill of exchange); United States v. Tingey, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115, 8 L.Ed. 66 (1831) (suit for\nbreach of contract); Cotton v. United States, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 229, 13 L.Ed. 675 (1850) (suit for trespass).\nBroadly speaking, the Supreme Court concluded that the power to bring suit was a logical and necessary adjunct\nto the executive's power to oversee the national government's proprietary and contractual interest. See also \nUnited States v. California, 332 U.S. 19, 27, 67 S.Ct. 1658, 91 L.Ed. 1889 (1947).\nThis limited view of the executive's power to sue was expanded somewhat in United States v. San Jacinto Tin\nCo., 125 U.S. 273, 8 S.Ct. 850, 31 L.Ed. 747 (1888), to allow suit to set aside a land patent based on alleged\nfraud. Accord, Kern River Co. v. United States, 257 U.S. 147, 155, 42 S.Ct. 60, 66 L.Ed. 175 (1921). San Jacinto\nTin seemed to require that the government have some \"pecuniary interest in the remedy sought,\" 125 U.S. at\n286, 8 S.Ct. at 857, but such a limitation was apparently abandoned in United States v. American Bell Telephone\nCo., 128 U.S. 315, 9 S.Ct. 90, 32 L.Ed. 450 (1888), where a right of action was granted to the executive to\nprotect the government from fraud in the issuance of a patent of invention. The Court in Bell Telephone\nconcluded that, despite the lack of any pecuniary interest of the government in rescinding the patent, it would be\na \"strange anomaly\" to make the government stand by while \"a party may practice an intentional fraud upon the\nofficers of the government who are authorized and whose duty it is to decide upon his right to a patent, and he\nmay by means of that fraud perpetrate a grievous wrong upon the general public.\" Id. at 357, 9 S.Ct. at 93.\nThis idea of basing the executive's nonstatutory power to sue on the notion of a \"grievous wrong upon the\ngeneral public,\" as opposed to basing it on an invasion of the executive's proprietary, contractual, or pecuniary\ninterest, was brought to full flower in the watershed case of In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.\n1092 (1895). The case involved the question of whether the Attorney General had authority to bring a suit for\ninjunction against activities of union leaders, including conspiracy to use violence to interrupt the mails, during the\nPullman strike of 1894. The Supreme Court found that he did. The Court could have rested its decision solely on\nthe executive's proprietary interest in protecting the mails, but Justice Brewer, after citing that basis for suit, went\non to conclude the following:\nWe do not care to place our decision upon this ground [protecting the mails] alone. Every\ngovernment, intrusted by the very terms of its being with powers and duties to be exercised and\ndischarged for the general welfare, has a right to apply to its own courts for any proper assistance\nin the exercise of the one and the discharge of the other, and it is no sufficient answer to its appeal\nto one of those courts that it has no pecuniary interest in the matter. The obligations which it is\nunder to promote the interest of all and to prevent the wrongdoing of one, resulting in injury to the\ngeneral welfare, is often of itself sufficient to give it a standing in court. This proposition in some of\nits relations has heretofore received the sanction of this court. [Whereupon, the Court discussed \nSan Jacinto Tin and Bell Telephone.] . . .\n. . . . .\n364 *364 It is obvious from these decisions that while it is not the province of the government to\ninterfere in any mere matter of private controversy between individuals, or to use its great powers\nto enforce the rights of one against another, yet, whenever the wrongs complained of are such as\naffect the public at large, and are in respect of matters which by the constitution are intrusted to\nthe care of the nation, and concerning which the nation owes the duty to all the citizens of\nsecuring to them their common rights, then the mere fact that the government has no pecuniary\ninterest in the controversy is not sufficient to exclude it from the courts, or prevent it from taking\nmeasures therein to fully discharge those constitutional duties.\nThe national government, given by the constitution power to regulate interstate commerce, has by\nexpress statute assumed jurisdiction over such commerce when carried upon railroads. It is\ncharged, therefore, with the duty of keeping those highways of interstate commerce free from\nobstruction, for it has always been recognized as one of the powers and duties of a government to\nremove obstructions from the highways under its control.\nId. at 584-86, 15 S.Ct. at 906-907.\n\nIt is not clear from the language of Debs just exactly how expansive a meaning the Court intended to attach to\nthe concept of \"wrongs . . . such as affect the public at large, and are in respect of matters which by the\nconstitution are intrusted to the care of the nation, and concerning which the nation owes the duty to all the\ncitizens of securing to them their common rights.\" In decisions subsequent to Debs, the Court has applied the\nconcept primarily to situations involving emergency obstructions to interstate commerce. For example, in Sanitary\nDistrict of Chicago v. United States, 266 U.S. 405, 45 S.Ct. 176, 69 L.Ed. 352 (1925), the Court allowed a suit by\nthe executive for an injunction against reversal of the flow of the Chicago River which threatened the water level\nof the Great Lakes. See also Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 191, 201-02, 88 S.Ct. 379,\n19 L.Ed.2d 407 (1967); United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, 492, 80 S.Ct. 884, 4 L.Ed.2d 903\n(1960).\nSome lower federal courts have determined that the Debs holding would have application in situations involving\nnational security. E. g., United States v. Marchetti, 466 F.2d 1309, 1313 (4th Cir. 1972),cert. denied,409 U.S.\n1063, 93 S.Ct. 553, 34 L.Ed.2d 516 (1972); United States v. Arlington County, Commonwealth of Virginia, 326\nF.2d 929 (4th Cir. 1964); United States v. New York Times Co., 328 F.Supp. 324, 327-28 (S.D.N.Y.1971),rev'd on\nother grounds,444 F.2d 544 (2d Cir. 1971),rev'd,403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971); United\nStates v. Brittain, 319 F.Supp. 1058, 1061 (N.D.Ala.1970). Such an application might be implied by the Supreme\nCourt's alternate holding in Sanitary District that the implementation of treaty obligations would also justify a suit\nby the executive without legislative authorization. United States v. City of Glen Cove, 322 F.Supp. 149\n(E.D.N.Y.1971),aff'd,450 F.2d 884 (2d Cir. 1971). However, the Court itself recently avoided an opportunity to\ndecide explicitly whether the Debs concept extends to national security matters. New York Times Co. v. United\nStates, 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (the \"Pentagon Papers\" case); see also Sullivan v.\nUnited States, 395 U.S. 169, 89 S.Ct. 1648, 23 L.Ed.2d 182 (1969); Paul v. United States, 371 U.S. 245, 83 S.Ct.\n426, 9 L.Ed.2d 292 (1963). That the executive's constitutional role in protecting national security is arguably\nmuch broader than its constitutional role in developing interstate commerce policy may be justification for\nextending the Debs principle into areas of national security, at least when dire emergencies are involved. Be that\nas it may, it suffices to note that no allegations concerning national security have been made in the instant case.\nDespite the susceptibility of Debs to the interpretation that the government's nonstatutory right to sue with regard\n365 to interstate commerce matters is activated only in *365 situations involving severe obstructions in the nature of\nemergency public nuisances, a series of civil rights cases brought by the Attorney General in states of the South\nin the early 1960's raised the possibility that Debs might have a much wider interstate commerce application. \nUnited States v. City of Jackson, 318 F.2d 1, 11-16 (5th Cir. 1963),reh. denied,320 F.2d 870 (1963) (per curiam);\nUnited States by Katzenbach v. Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, 250 F.Supp. 330, 356 (E.D.La.1965); United\nStates v. City of Shreveport, 210 F.Supp. 36 (W.D.La.1962); United States v. Lassiter, 203 F.Supp. 20\n(W.D.La.1962),aff'd,371 U.S. 10, 83 S.Ct. 21, 9 L.Ed.2d 47 (1962) (per curiam); United States v. City of\nMontgomery, 201 F.Supp. 590 (M.D.Ala.1962); United States v. U. S. Klans, Knights of Ku Klux Klan, Inc., 194\nF.Supp. 897, 902 (M.D. Ala.1961). A basic thrust of these cases was that racial discrimination in public\naccommodations and interference with travel on the basis of race constituted obstructions of interstate commerce\nwhich the Attorney General could sue to remove without Congressional authorization. Such \"obstructions\" could\nbe viewed as less emergent, less tangible, and less direct than the obstructions in Debs. So viewed, this line of\ncivil rights cases constitutes an extension of Debs. On the other hand, it could be argued that owing to the\nextremely tense racial situation in the early 1960's, these \"obstructions\" which the Attorney General was\nattempting to enjoin constituted no less of an emergency threat to interstate commerce than the violent actions\ninvolved in Debs. In other words, it would not be illogical to conclude that these civil rights cases did not go\nbeyond a narrow interpretation of the Debs concept at all. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that when the\nFifth Circuit panel in City of Jackson refused a rehearing, two judges took the opportunity to disavow any support\nfor Judge Wisdom's prior opinion for the court insofar as it had suggested the possibility of broadened\nnonstatutory right for the executive to sue. These two judges instead concluded that a Congressional enactment\nhad specifically authorized the suit before them. 320 F.2d at 871-73 (Bootle, J. and Ainsworth, J., specially\nconcurring).\nNevertheless, a very broad reading of Debs and its civil rights progeny was adopted in the case of United States\nv. Brand Jewelers, Inc., 318 F.Supp. 1293 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). The Attorney General had brought the suit to halt the\n\nscurrilous practice of \"sewer service\" in New York City. This practice involved the sale by unscrupulous retailers\nof consumer items on easy credit terms. The sales were quickly followed by lawsuits by the retailers claiming that\ncredit payments had not been made. The retailer would employ private process servers in such suits with the\napparent intention that service not actually be made (hence, the name \"sewer service,\" for the alleged practice of\nthe private process servers of simply throwing process papers into the gutter). The idea was to obtain a cheap\ndefault judgment with which to garnish the unknowing defendant's salary.\nOne of the government's arguments in favor of its being able to bring the suit without Congressional authorization\nin Brand Jewelers was that the practice of \"sewer service\" constituted a substantial burden on interstate\ncommerce due to losses of employment from garnishments, burdens upon employers, and disruptions of labor-\nmanagement relations. Responding to the defendant's argument that this \"burden\" was quite different from the\nobstructive crisis in Debs, Judge Frankel concluded that \"no plausible reason\" existed for attributing any\nsignificance to the distinction between physical and nonphysical burdens and between direct and indirect\nburdens. Id. at 1298-99. He cited the civil rights cases and the Arlington County decision dealing with national\nsecurity as authority for this conclusion. His decision, therefore, stands for the notion that chronic, indirect,\nintangible burdens on interstate commerce are as sufficient to give the federal executive nonstatutory authority to\nsue as emergent, physical obstructions of the Debs or Sanitary District variety.\n366 Judge Frankel's expansive application of Debs has been roundly criticized. E. g.,*366 Note, Nonstatutory\nExecutive Authority to Bring Suit, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 1566 (1972); Recent Decision, Federal Courts00Standing\n97\n00United States Has Non-Statutory Authority Under Commerce and Due Process Clauses to Bring Suit to Enjoin\n97\n\"Sewer Service\" Practices by Private Business00 United States v. Brand Jewelers, Inc., 84 Harv.L.Rev. 1930\n97\n(1971); Note, Constitutional Law00United States Government's Standing to Sue00A New Approach to Legal\n97 97\nAssistance for Ghetto Residents or an Invitation to Executive Lawmaking? 17 Wayne L.Rev. 1287 (1971). With all\ndue respect to Judge Frankel, this Court finds itself in agreement with much of the criticism.\nThe extension of the Debs principle toward the outer limits of the definition of \"burdens\" on interstate commerce\nworks a subtle reorganization of the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the\nfederal government. Congress has been specifically entrusted with primary responsibility for the regulation of\ninterstate commerce. U.S.Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. It is one thing to give the executive an independent role when\nthere is an emergency threat to interstate commerce to which only the executive branch of government has the\ncapacity to respond with appropriate alacrity, but it is quite another thing to give the executive an independent\nrole where the \"emergency\" is debatable and all that may be at stake is the development of policy concerning\ninterstate commerce. The commerce clause clearly anticipates that policy development is to be left to Congress.\nIt is no answer to this analysis of the structure of our government to suggest, as Judge Frankel did (see Brand\nJewelers, supra at 1299), that the power to sue is not really an independent power because it is, after all, subject\nto the check and balance of the judiciary which adjudicates the merits of any suit. Lawsuits, especially ones\nbrought by the federal government, unquestionably have an impact that transcends any adjudication which may\noccur. Settlement, particularly where it involves pure capitulation by the defendant, can result in a de facto policy\nwhich has never been subject to the check of final adjudication. More important, though, the wisdom of a judge,\neven if he gets a chance to exercise it, is no substitute in our system of representative government for the\npolitical process of the legislature in areas of important policy development such as interstate commerce.\nIt is also no answer to the balance-of-powers problem to presume, see id., that the legislature can and will correct\nany result with which it does not concur. The policy effected by the lawsuit may be irreversible, or at least the\nreversal may prove more troublesome than the effort is worth. Action by Congress is usually time-consuming and\nquite arduous. To place a burden of response on the legislative process would undoubtedly result in the\ndevelopment of ambiguous policy situations in which, for whatever reasons, the legislature has been unable to\ngrind out either an explicit approval or disapproval of the policy brought into being by an executive lawsuit.\nPerhaps the strongest reason against allowing the nonstatutory authority of the executive to sue to extend to the\nbroadest reaches of interstate commerce is the impact such power has on our system of federalism. Difficult\nindeed is the task of anyone who tries to demonstrate in this day and age that any action, especially a state\nprogram or policy, has no effect on interstate commerce. Thus, if the executive nonstatutory power to sue to\nprotect interstate commerce is given its broadest application, no state policy or program will be safe from the\n\nquestioning eyes of those few lawyer-bureaucrats who have the authority to devise government lawsuits. Such\nan affront to the federal system of shared powers should not be countenanced unless absolutely necessary. Cf. \nRizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).\nOf course, this Court is fully cognizant of the fact that the Supreme Court has allowed the powers of Congress\n367 itself to reach into the farthest and darkest nooks *367 and crannies of man's conception of \"interstate\ncommerce.\" E. g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). This, too, can lead to\nserious debasement of the principle of federalism. See, e. g., Maryland v. Wirtz, 269 F.Supp. 826, 852-55\n(D.Md.1967) (Northrop, J., dissenting), aff'd,392 U.S. 183, 201-05, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968)\n(Douglas, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court, however, is now demonstrating a greater concern for\nCongressional assaults on federalism through the Commerce Clause. The National League of Cities v. Usery,\n___ U.S. ___, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976) (which expressly overruled Maryland v. Wirtz). In any event,\nit can at least be said that Congressional impingement on state policy-making sovereignty is quite different from\nexecutive intrusion. The members of Congress are drawn from and maintain close ties with their respective\nstates; thus, Congress cannot act without the states in a sense having some say in the matter. The same cannot\nbe said when the executive branch of the federal government acts alone. It must also be noted that the legislative\nprocess is by its very nature less given to the influence of the whims and fancy of just one or two individuals. In\nshort, troubling though the encroachment of Congress through the Commerce Clause on the integrity of state\nsovereignty may be, allowing the executive to exercise independent powers of encroachment would be far more\ntroubling.\nHaving said all of this, this Court hastens to recognize that the government in the instant case is not claiming that\nits power to sue stems from a burden on interstate commerce. The foregoing analysis is not in vain, however, for\nthe same considerations which militate against extending Debs to the limits of the notion of burdens on interstate\ncommerce also dictate against acceptance of the government's argument in this case that the Debs principle\nshould be extended beyond interstate commerce into the area of thirteenth or fourteenth amendment\nenforcement.\nApparent authority for the government's position is found in Brand Jewelers. Judge Frankel not only extended the\nDebs principle as it applies to obstruction of commerce, but he alternatively held that the executive has a\nnonstatutory right to sue under the fourteenth amendment irrespective of any burdens on interstate commerce. In\nreaching this conclusion, the judge chose not to follow several courts which had determined that the Attorney\nGeneral has no such sweeping power. United States v. County School Board, Prince George County, Virginia,\n221 F.Supp. 93, 103-04 (E.D.Va.1963) (dictum); United States v. Biloxi Municipal School District, 219 F.Supp.\n691, 693-94 (S.D.Miss.1963) and United States v. Madison County Board of Education, 219 F.Supp. 60, 61\n(N.D.Ala.1963),both aff'd on other grounds, 326 F.2d 237 (5th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 929, 85 S.Ct.\n324, 13 L.Ed.2d 341 (1964). Instead, he relied on the more tenuous authority represented by Judge Wisdom's\nopinion in City of Jackson, supra, which, as previously pointed out, was rejected by the other two judges insofar\nas it suggested (and, indeed, it had only \"suggested\" without indicating total acceptance) application of the\nprinciples on which Judge Frankel wished to rely, and on a dissent in United States v. Mississippi, 229 F.Supp.\n925, 976 (S.D.Miss.1964) (Brown, J., dissenting), rev'd,380 U.S. 128, 85 S.Ct. 808, 13 L.Ed.2d 717 (1965) which\nrelied entirely on Judge Wisdom's opinion.\nRealizing that his holding was breaking new ground in the application of Debs, Judge Frankel offered the\nfollowing justification for the expansion:\n[T]his court finds no acceptable basis in principle for distinguishing today the authority of the\nAttorney General to protect against large-scale burdens on interstate commerce from his authority\nto protect against large-scale denials of due process. The dramatic history of how great judges\nparticipated in the building of a nation by imaginative unfolding of the commerce power needs no\nretelling here. Nor is it necessary now to be portentous about the new struggles for individual\n368 rights and decency that may be *368 vital for the preservation of what our predecessors built. It\nseems sufficient for present purposes to say that there appears to be no pertinent constitutional\ndifference between the national power to regulate commerce and the prohibition in the Fourteenth\nAmendment which the United States seeks in this suit to enforce.\n\nUnited States v. Brand Jewelers, supra at 1300; see also Alexander v. Hall, 64 F.R.D. 152, 157 (D.S.C.1974)\n(allowing government intervention in a suit challenging state commitment and detainment procedures for the\nmentally ill).\nThis Court respectfully declines to follow this \"imaginative unfolding\" of the Debs principle into the area of\nfourteenth amendment enforcement.\nJust as nonstatutory executive power to sue based on a broad notion of burdens on interstate commerce\ninsinuates the federal legal bureaucracy into practically every conceivable affair of state policy-making, thereby\ndestroying federalism, so too does a power to sue based on notions of deprivation of thirteenth and fourteenth\namendment rights. Such a blow to federalism might arguably be justified if absolutely no other adequate\nprotection for fourteenth amendment rights were available. This \"absolute necessity\" factor was perhaps a key in\nthe application of the Debs principle in the civil rights cases of the early 1960's, for the pervasive racial\ndiscrimination which was in issue in those cases also worked as a mighty deterrent to any kind of effective court\naction by the aggrieved individuals themselves. No such \"absolute necessity\" obtains in the instant case. As\nevidenced by the suits which are presently pending in this court and in the state courts, the mentally retarded are\n[2]\ncertainly not without adequate resources for the protection of their civil rights. See Maryland Association for\nRetarded Citizens, Inc. v. Solomon, supra; Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Maryland, supra;\nBauer v. Mandel, supra; and Maryland Association for Retarded Citizens v. Department of Health & Mental\nHygiene, supra.\nAs with interstate commerce, policy-making in the area of enforcement of the thirteenth and fourteenth\namendments is primarily entrusted to Congress. U.S. Const., Amend. 13, § 2; Amend. 14, § 5. Thus, any\nextension of independent authority to the executive in enforcing the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments is\nfraught with potential for undoing the balance of powers between the branches of the government. With regard to\nthis balance of power, it is extremely significant to note that the Debs extension of independent nonstatutory\nauthority to the executive took place in the context of Congress not having expressed any opinion as to whether\nthe executive should have such new power. Debs, and its predecessors and progeny, could in fact be read as\nfinding that the nonstatutory authority of the executive to sue extends only to situations in which it can be\nsurmised that Congress wants the executive to sue. The instant case reveals a quite different picture of the will of\nCongress.\nPursuant to its power to regulate interstate commerce and to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of\nthe thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, Congress has enacted numerous enforcement schemes\ninvolving the Attorney General. See, e. g., 18 U.S.C. § 242; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1973, 1974, 2000a-5, 2000b,\n2000c-6, 2000e-6, 2000h-2, 2000h-3. None of these authorizations covers the situation in the instant case. It\n369 could therefore be argued that Congress intended that the executive *369 not sue in a case like the instant one.\nTo counter this inference, the government contends, first of all, that Congress' various specific authorizations for\nsuit by the Attorney General constitute merely \"legislative direction\" for the exercise of the sweeping power which\nCongress otherwise generally intends the Attorney General to have in thirteenth and fourteenth amendment\ncases. In other words, the specific authorizations are actually diminutions of the power Congress otherwise wants\nthe executive to have. It can hardly be believed, however, that Congress would go to so much effort just to give\n\"direction.\" United States v. School District of Ferndale, Michigan,, 400 F.Supp. 1122, 1130 (E.D.Mich.1975). In\nany event, as will be demonstrated infra, the tenor, as well as the substance, of the Congressional debates and\nreports regarding the various civil rights acts belies any such notion.\nThe government also points out that Congress has passed much legislation evidencing concern for the mentally\nretarded. Although, like the civil rights legislation, none of the mental retardation legislation provides explicit\nauthority for the instant suit, the government contends that the two types of legislation taken together impliedly\nsanction a suit like the instant one.\nThis Court recognizes that it is proper to infer in some situations that Congress tacitly intended a more wide-\nreaching scheme for the accomplishment of its goals than it was able to articulate. Wyandotte, etc. v. United\n\nStates, supra; United States v. Republic Steel Corp., supra. This, however, is not an appropriate case for such an\ninference.\nFirst, in one of the enactments cited by the government, the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of\n370 Rights Act (the \"Act\"),[3] Congress has provided a *370 scheme whereby the executive branch of government\ncan accomplish much of what the Attorney General hopes to accomplish in this suit. Under this Act, in order for a\nstate to receive federal funds for construction of new facilities and provision of new services for the mentally\nretarded, it must agree to abide by qualitative standards for habilitative care prescribed in regulations\npromulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare. 42 U.S.C. §§ 6008, 6063. A state's funds may be\ndiscontinued (after notice and opportunity for hearing) if the Secretary finds that the standards prescribed by the\nregulations are no longer being met. 42 U.S.C. § 6065. Thus, Congress has devised what it hopes will be an\n[4]\neffective carrot-and-stick method of improving the lot of the mentally retarded in America.  This Court simply\ncannot believe that Congress intended or expected that while an elaborate plan to improve the lot of the mentally\nretarded was being implemented by the one federal agency (the Department of Health, Education & Welfare) with\nexpertise in the field of mental retardation, another government agency (the Department of Justice) with no\nexpertise in the solution of the very difficult problems posed by mental retardation would simultaneously be\nmaking wholesale attacks on a state's mental retardation programs under the guise of protecting thirteenth and\nfourteenth amendment rights. Surely, if Congress had wanted two agencies to be involved in ameliorating the\nstates' efforts to help the mentally retarded, it would have at least provided some legislative guidance as to\nprocedures for preventing the conflict and contradictory goals that can and do occur when two federal agencies\nindependently act on the same matter.\nAn even stronger reason for not inferring from the various Congressional enactments aimed at helping the\nmentally retarded and protecting civil rights that Congress tacitly sanctions a broad authority to sue for the\nAttorney General is that Congress has several times explicitly considered and rejected the idea of broadening the\nAttorney General's powers to sue to protect citizens' rights under the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments.\nThe bill passed by the House of Representatives which ultimately became the Civil Rights Act of 1957 included a\n[5]\nsection, Title III,  giving the Attorney General broad powers to seek civil remedies in civil rights cases involving\nviolations of 42 U.S.C. § 1985. The inclusion of Title III was apparently in response to the then Attorney General's\nrequest that he be given the expanded powers. See Letter of Attorney General Herbert Brownell, H.R.Rep.No.\n291, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957), 1957 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 1979-80. After vehement\nopposition to Title III on the floor of the Senate00opposition based in significant part on the effect such broad\n97\n371 power might have on the balance of powers between the federal and state governments, *371 see 103\nCong.Rec. 12530-12565 (daily ed. July 24, 1957)00it was deleted from the Senate version of the bill, and the Civil\n97\nRights Act of 1957 was subsequently enacted without it.\nAn attempt to rejuvenate Title III in the Civil Rights Act of 1960 was also rejected. See H.R.Rep.No.956, 86th\nCong., 2d Sess. (1960), 1960 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 1940; 106 Cong.Rec. 5151-5182 (daily ed. Mar.\n10, 1960).\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly broadened the Attorney General's power to bring suits, but the House\nexplicitly rejected in committee an attempt to incorporate broad, Title III-type powers for the Attorney General.\n[6]\nSee H.R.Rep.No.914, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), 1964 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 2392-93, 2411.\nPerhaps a significant factor in the House's rejection of the notion of expanding the Attorney General's power to\nbring suit to the ultimate limits allowed by the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments was the caution of then\nAttorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who made the following remarks to the Committee on the Judiciary:\nTitle III would extend to claimed violations of constitutional rights in State criminal proceedings or\nin book or movie censorship; disputes involving church-state relations; economic questions such\nas allegedly confiscatory ratemaking or the constitutional requirement of just compensation in land\nacquisition cases; the propriety of incarceration in mental hospital; searches and seizures; and\ncontroversies involving freedom of worship, or speech, or of the press.\n\nObviously, the proposal injects Federal executive authority into some areas which are not its\nlegitimate concern and vests the Attorney General with broad discretion in matters of great\npolitical and social concern.\n. . . Which types of disputes should the Attorney General make a matter of Federal concern? . . .\nId. at 2450 (emphasis added).\nThus, since Congress has explicitly considered and rejected extending the authority of the Attorney General to\nsue generally in cases such as the instant one, the inference is strong that Congress feels the Attorney General\nshould not have a power to sue broader than that it has specifically given.\nThe government attempts to overcome Congress' rejection of broader powers to sue by asserting that the\nauthority to sue can be inferred even where Congress has explicitly considered and rejected such authority. The\ngovernment cites as authority for this proposition the case of United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19, 27-28, 67\nS.Ct. 1658, 91 L.Ed. 1889 (1947), in which the government's authority to sue to void leases improperly granted\nby California for oil exploration in offshore lands owned by the federal government was upheld in the face of two\nprior failures of Congress to grant such power to sue. A significant aspect of the Supreme Court's decision,\nhowever, was the explanation in a footnote that Congress had failed to grant such power to sue because it felt\nthat the executive already had such power in the situation involved. Id. at 28 n. 4, 67 S.Ct. 1658. In the instant\ncase, on the other hand, Congress has failed to grant the power to sue, not because it feels the executive already\nhas such power, but because it apparently doubts whether the executive should have such power. United States\nv. California therefore does not constitute authority for allowing suit by the executive in this case.\nWhen the apparent will of Congress is that the executive should not have a power, the burden of the executive to\n372 show that it should nevertheless have the power is an extremely heavy one, \"for what *372 is at stake is the\nequilibrium established by our constitutional system.\" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., Inc. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S.\n579, 637-38, 72 S.Ct. 863, 871, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (the \"Steel Seizure\" case). When\nthe independent authority (or, as plaintiff terms it, the \"inherent power\") is sought to be exercised in an area of\nconcern, such as national security, where the executive's Constitutional role is equal, if not superior, to that of\nCongress, the executive's burden may be eased somewhat. But when the independent executive authority is\nsought to be exercised in an area of concern, such as the protection of fourteenth amendment rights or the\ndevelopment of interstate commerce policy, where the role of Congress is predominant under the Constitution,\nthe executive's burden of showing the need for an independent authority to act is most severe.\nThat severe burden is not sustained in the instant case by the government's incantation of the Constitution's\ncharge to the executive that it \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" Art. II, § 3. While this duty may\nprovide a basis for independent action in certain very limited situations where Congress has not taken a position\nconcerning such action, see, e. g., In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 63-66, 10 S.Ct. 658, 34 L.Ed. 55 (1890), in general it\nis subject to the wise circumscription expressed by Justice Frankfurter in the Steel Seizure case:\nApart from his vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, the embracing\nfunction of the President is that \"he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed * * *.\" Art.\nII, § 3. The nature of that authority has for me been comprehensively indicated by Mr. Justice\nHolmes. \"The duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go\nbeyond the laws or require him to achieve more than Congress sees fit to leave within his power.\" \nMyers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 177, 47 S.Ct. 21, 85, 71 L.Ed. 160. The powers of the\nPresident are not as particularized as are those of Congress. But unenumerated powers do not\nmean undefined powers. The separation of powers built into our Constitution gives essential\ncontent to undefined provisions in the frame of our government.\nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co., Inc. v. Sawyer, supra, 343 U.S. at 610, 72 S.Ct. at 897 (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring).\nIn this case, the executive has not shown to exist with regard to the protection of the rights of the mentally\nretarded citizens of Maryland, anything approaching a situation of national emergency, the appropriate response\n\nto which can only be made independently by the executive branch of the federal government. Thus, this Court\nconcludes that the executive's severe burden to justify independent action in the face of Congressional\ndisapproval of such action has not been met, and the federal executive therefore lacks standing to bring the\ninstant action.\nAccordingly, IT IS, this 8th day of July, 1976, by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland,\nORDERED:\n1. That defendants' Motion to Dismiss this action BE, and the same hereby IS, GRANTED; and\n2. That the within case BE, and the same hereby IS, DISMISSED.\n[1] It can perhaps be argued that such a power is contemplated, at least in some circumstances, by Article III,\nSection 2, which extends the judicial power to \"controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.\"\n[2] Of course, concerns about federalism can also play a significant role in civil rights suits brought by individuals,\nparticularly where the remedy sought involves the creation of new state programs, Rizzo v. Goode, supra, or a\nmajor continuing intrusion of the Federal courts into the daily conduct of state affairs. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S.\n488, 502, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). It would be premature to speculate at this point what the effect of\nsuch concerns might be in a suit brought by individuals which contains the type of allegations and requests for\nremedies present in the instant suit.\n[3] 42 U.S.C. § 6001 et seq. This legislation pulls together and embellishes several prior enactments aimed at\ndeveloping a meaningful federal program for assisting the states and private agencies in improving habilitative\nservices for the mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled persons. The background of the legislation\nis succinctly presented in the following excerpt from the legislative history: \nDevelopmental disabilities are disabilities, such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, dyslexia\nand neurological conditions, which originate in childhood, continue indefinitely, and constitute a substantial\nhandicap to the affected individual. There are over 6 million people in the United States suffering from mental\nretardation and, depending on who is counted, an additional several million people suffering from other\ndevelopmental disabilities. Citizens with developmental disabilities need support and assistance with learning and\nliving so that they may function in our society as the citizens that they are with maximum effectiveness.\nThe Congress of the United States began to respond to the needs of these millions of people many years ago\nwith an assortment of social security and rehabilitation programs. This response received new impetus in 1963\nwith the enactment of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act\nof 1963 (Public Law 88-164, October 31, 1963). This Act provided for centers for research on the mentally\nretarded, construction of university affiliated facilities for the mentally retarded, construction of other facilities for\nthe mentally retarded, and training of teachers of mentally retarded and other handicapped children.\nThe legislation was continued with modest revisions by the Mental Retardation Amendments of 1967 (Public Law\n90-170). This Act extended the authority for grants for the construction of facilities for the mentally retarded and\nuniversity-affiliated facilities through June, 1970, added authority for grants for the costs of the professional and\ntechnical personnel of community mental retardation facilities, added authority for the training of physical\neducators and recreation personnel for such facilities, and broadened the definition of mental retardation to\ninclude neurological handicaps related to it.\nThe Act was subsequently rewritten in 1970 by the Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities\nConstruction Amendments (Public Law 91-517). This Act changed the title of the program and its direction to a\nbroader and more inclusive concern for the developmentally disabled generally. It authorized formula grants to\nstates for planning, administration, construction, and services concerned with developmental disabilities, grants\nfor interdisciplinary training programs in institutions of higher learning, grants for special projects of national\nsignificance, grants for the construction and operation of university-affiliated facilities for those with\ndevelopmental disabilities, and provided for the establishment of a National Advisory Council on Services and\nFacilities for the Mentally Disabled.\n\nH.R.Report No. 94-58, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975), 1975 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 921-22.\n[4] A similar carrot-and-stick approach to improving services by the states is present in other enactments which\naffect the mentally retarded. See, esp., 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395-96 (\"Medicaid\"). Maryland receives substantial\namounts of funds under the Medicaid program for care of persons at Rosewood Hospital. Plaintiff's Brief,\nAddendum B. Significantly, as revealed at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, Maryland is at this very moment\nengaged in an effort to ensure that its programs at Rosewood meet the rigorous requirements of the Medicaid\nprogram. See also 42 U.S.C. § 1397.\n[5] Title III read in pertinent part as follows: \nSection 121, Section 1980 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1985) is amended . . . to read as follows: \"Fourth.\nWhenever any persons have engaged or there are reasonable grounds to believe that any persons are about to\nengage in any acts or practices which would give rise to a cause of action pursuant to paragraphs 1st, 2nd, or\n3rd, the Attorney-General may institute for the United States, or in the name of the United States, a civil action or\nother proper proceeding for preventive relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary injunction,\nrestraining order, or other order. . .\"\n[6] The bill passed by Congress did provide broad power for the Attorney General to intervene in fourteenth\namendment cases. 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. It is unnecessary at this time to decide whether this intervention\nauthorization might justify a different line of analysis in a case where the government seeks authority to intervene\nin a situation outside the boundaries of this specific authorization. Consider, e. g., In re Estelle, 516 F.2d 480 (5th\nCir. 1975),cert. denied,426 U.S. 925, 96 S.Ct. 2637, 49 L.Ed.2d 380 (1976); Alexander v.

Gen., State of\nConnecticut, for Amicus Curiae.\nBefore WINTER, BUTZNER and HALL, Circuit Judges.\nWINTER, Circuit Judge:\nThe question we must decide is whether the Attorney General of the United States, without specific statutory\nauthorization, has the right to bring suit on behalf of the United States against three state officials, responsible for\nthe operation of a state hospital for the confinement and treatment of mentally retarded persons, to redress the\nalleged deprivation of Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the patients. The district court\nconcluded that he did not and it dismissed the complaint. We agree, and we therefore affirm.\nI.\nThe dismissed complaint alleges that Rosewood State Hospital, located at Owings Mills, Maryland, was\nestablished and is operated by officials of the State of Maryland for the purpose of providing treatment and care\nto mentally retarded persons. Approximately 2,400 persons are patients at Rosewood, and many are committed\nthere and involuntarily confined. About one-half of the patients are younger than twenty-one, and about one-half\nof the patients are classified as severely or profoundly mentally retarded. It is asserted that, notwithstanding that\nall, or nearly all, mentally retarded patients at Rosewood are capable of benefitting from treatment and\nrehabilitative care, defendants, who are charged with responsibility for the operation of Rosewood, have failed or\nrefused to provide treatment and rehabilitative care to patients in a number of respects. It is also asserted that, in\na number of respects, defendants have failed or refused to provide Rosewood patients with decent and humane\n\nliving conditions and to keep them free from harm. As a consequence, it is alleged that the rights of these patients\nunder the Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments are being infringed.\nIn a submission made to the district court to supplement the complaint, it is asserted that Rosewood receives\nsubstantial amounts of federal funds. For example, in 1975 it received in excess of $5.6 million from the\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare, mostly as payments under the Medicare Program, in excess of\n$12,000 from the Department of Defense for providing rehabilitative treatment for military dependents entitled to\nmilitary health care, and a smaller amount from the Department of Agriculture. Similar payments, in comparable\namounts, were made from each of these sources for 1974 and 1973, and some funds from still other federal\nsources are received.\nThe complaint alleges that the United States has a direct concern in the proper treatment, habilitation, and rights\nof mentally retarded patients at Rosewood by virtue of a Presidential Statement on Mental Retardation\n(November 16, 1971), as well as §§ 1905(c) & (d) of Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(c) &\n(d)), the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. §§ 1401 et seq.), and the Developmental Disabilities\nServices and Facilities Construction Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2661-2666 and 2670-2677c) (as now amended by the\nDevelopmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, P.L. 94-103, 89 Stat. 486, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6001-6012\n[1]\n(1977)).\n1124 The United States sought equitable relief against continuation of the claimed deprivations, *1124 asserting it to\nbe the only adequate means of preventing the unconstitutional practices being committed by defendants. The\ndistrict court, however, dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the United States lacked the authority and\nstanding to bring the suit.\nII.\nIt is too late in the day to deny that in a proper case the protections of the Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth\nAmendments extend to the mentally retarded who are involuntarily confined. See, e. g., Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503\nF.2d 1305, 1316 (5 Cir. 1974). Similarly, we have no doubt that if the United States had authority to bring the suit,\nthe Attorney General of the United States is the one to act as its counsel. The provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§ 516-519\nrequire this conclusion because the language of § 516 could hardly be clearer: \"Except as otherwise authorized\nby law, the conduct of litigation in which the United States . . . is a party . . . is reserved to officers of the\n[2]\nDepartment of Justice, under the direction of the Attorney General.\"  But this statute does not decide this case.\nIt is merely a housekeeping provision. United States v. Daniel, Urbahn, Seelyle and Fuller, 357 F.Supp. 853,\n857-58 (N.D.Ill.1973); Allen v. School Bd. of Prince Edward City, 28 F.R.D. 358 (E.D.Va.1961). As said in Daniel,\nUrbahn, Seelyle and Fuller, \"[Section 516] does not explicitly provide that officers of the Department of Justice\nmay conduct any litigation in which they believe the government has any interest; it merely provides that if any is\nconducted, it shall be done by the Department of Justice.\" 357 F.Supp. at 858.\nIII.\nThus, the question presented by this case, as we see it, is whether the United States or the Attorney General had\nauthority to sue to redress the alleged deprivations of the patients' rights. The answer to the question is to be\nfound in a consideration of the statutes on which the government relies and a determination of whether they\nexplicitly authorize the suit, and, if they do not, a consideration of the scope and application of the judicially\ncreated doctrine of permitting a suit by the United States, despite lack of statutory authorization, in certain areas\nin which the United States has an interest.\nIn the instant case, while the United States points to numerous examples of federal legislation evidencing federal\ninterest, concern and action with respect to the mentally retarded, it points to no statute which explicitly\nauthorizes the bringing of this suit. The closest that the government comes to citing a statute granting authority to\nsue is in its discussion of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6010 et\nseq., but even then the United States relies not on the statute but on its legislative history. The statute, § 6010,\n\nenacts a bill of rights for persons with developmental disabilities; that is, a statement of minimum objectives and\nstandards for their treatment, services and habilitation which is made binding on both the federal government and\nthe states. In the legislative history of this Act, the statement is made that the rights of such persons should be\nprotected and assured by Congress and the courts. Conf.Rep. No. 94-473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 42; [1975]\n[3]\nU.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 919, 961.\n1125 *1125 The Act is legislation to provide grants in aid to the states. A grant is given to a state if the state submits a\nplan complying with the statutory and administrative requirements set forth in §§ 6011 and 6012. Included in\nthese are the requirements of § 6012(a) that the state \"will have in effect a system to protect . . . the rights of\npersons with developmental disabilities\" and that the system will \"have the authority to pursue legal,\nadministrative, and other appropriate remedies to insure the protection of the rights of such persons . . ..\" Once a\ngrant has been given to a state, the Act imposes no continuing duty on the United States to see to its proper\napplication. Indeed, § 6003 particularly states that, except as specifically provided otherwise, \"nothing contained\nin this chapter shall be construed as conferring on any Federal officer or employee the right to exercise any\nsupervision or control over the administration, personnel, maintenance or operation\" of any facility such as\nRosewood.\nThus, we do not think that the Act is capable of a reading that explicitly gives the United States the right to\ninstitute this suit. The language in the conference committee report referring to the right to resort to a judicial\nforum for the protection of the right to treatment manifestly refers to a state judicial forum and not to a federal\njudicial forum where the United States customarily sues.\n[4]\nNor do we find implicit authority in any of the legislation on which the government relies to authorize it to sue.\nWe have no doubt that the United States has an interest, in the generic sense, in the subject matter of the suit,\nand that it has an interest, in the generic sense, in seeing that the various funds which it pays to Rosewood are\nproperly expended. We note that the suit is not one against the State of Maryland to enforce the condition of a\ngrant or for breach of a contract pursuant to which a grant was made. Where we differ from the government's\n1126 conception of the issue *1126 before us is that we view the case as one of a question of authority and not simply\nof interest. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952),\ndiscussed infra. Express or implicit statutory authority to sue simply does not exist.\nIV.\nSince we find no statute which expressly or impliedly authorizes the filing of this suit, we consider whether the\ncase is one within the line of authorities permitting the United States to sue even when not authorized by statute.\nThe historical development of the doctrine is well summarized in P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler,\nHart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and The Federal System, 1301-09 (1972), and Note, Nonstatutory\nExecutive Authority to Bring Suit, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 1566 (1972). Succinctly stated, it can be said that it was early\nestablished that, without benefit of statute, the United States could bring suit on a contract to which it was a party\nor to protect or vindicate a right to property which it owned. See, e. g., Dugan v. United States, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.)\n172, 4 L.Ed. 362 (1818); United States v. Tingey, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115, 8 L.Ed. 66 (1831); Cotton v. United States,\n52 U.S. (11 How.) 229, 13 L.Ed. 675 (1850); Jessup v. United States, 106 U.S. 147, 1 S.Ct. 74, 27 L.Ed. 85\n(1882). Its right to sue as guardian of the Indian tribes and to vindicate the rights of its Indian wards is\nestablished. See, e. g., Heckman v. United States, 224 U.S. 413, 32 S.Ct. 424, 56 L.Ed. 820 (1912); United\nStates v. Board of Comm'rs of Osage County, 251 U.S. 128, 40 S.Ct. 100, 64 L.Ed. 184 (1919).\nRecognition of the right to sue to protect the public, as distinguished from its own property interests or those of\nthe persons for which it was guardian, occurred in United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U.S. 273, 8 S.Ct.\n850, 31 L.Ed. 747 (1888) (patent to land allegedly procured by fraud), and United States v. American Bell\nTelephone Co., 128 U.S. 315, 9 S.Ct. 90, 32 L.Ed. 450 (1888) (letters patent to an invention allegedly fraudulently\nobtained).\nThe real expansion in the doctrine permitting the United States to sue without specific authorization occurred in In\nre Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092 (1895). That case arose out of the Pullman strike of 1894. It\n\nwas an application for a writ of habeas corpus questioning the validity of an injunction for violation of which the\npetitioner was held in contempt and committed. The injunction had been granted in a suit to enjoin the strike in\nwhich the district court's jurisdictional base was alleged to be a conspiracy to obstruct the carriage of the mails\nand processes of interstate transportation in violation of the Sherman Act. Although in sustaining the district\ncourt's assertion of jurisdiction the Court could well have relied on established doctrines, the Court stated its\npreference to place its decision on broader grounds:\nSumming up our conclusions, we hold that the government of the United States is one having\njurisdiction over every foot of soil within its territory, and acting directly upon each citizen; that\nwhile it is a government of enumerated powers, it has within the limits of those powers all the\nattributes of sovereignty; that to it is committed power over interstate commerce and the\ntransmission of the mail; that the powers thus conferred upon the national government are not\ndormant, but have been assumed and put into practical exercise by the legislation of Congress;\nthat in the exercise of those powers it is competent for the nation to remove all obstructions upon\nhighways, natural or artificial, to the passage of interstate commerce or the carrying of the mail;\nthat while it may be competent for the government (through the executive branch and in the use of\nthe entire executive power of the nation) to forcibly remove all such obstructions, it is equally\n1127 within its competency to appeal to the civil courts for an inquiry and determination *1127 as to the\nexistence and character of any alleged obstructions, and if such are found to exist, or threaten to\noccur, to invoke the powers of those courts to remove or restrain such obstructions; that the\njurisdiction of courts to interfere in such matters by injunction is one recognized from ancient times\nand by indubitable authority; . . .. 158 U.S. at 599, 15 S.Ct. at 912.\nThe exact contours of Debs are difficult to fathom and they have received differing interpretations in the decided\ncases. If Debs is given its most expansive possible meaning, the executive may sue without statutory\nauthorization whenever the alleged violations \"affect the public at large.\" 158 U.S. at 586, 15 S.Ct. 900. One court\nhas come close to this reading. United States v. Brand Jewelers, Inc., 318 F.Supp. 1293 (S.D.N.Y.1970), and the \nBrand Jewelers' court treated our decision in United States v. Arlington County, 326 F.2d 929 (4 Cir. 1964) as\nsupporting this result. Other courts, however, have treated Debs as depending upon one or more of the particular\nelements of the facts on which it was decided, e. g., a situation of national emergency, a case where Congress\nhad exercised the constitutional power which was impugned by the action sought to be redressed, the harm was\na public nuisance, and there was a statute authorizing suit on which the decision could have been grounded. \nSanitary District v. United States, 266 U.S. 405, 45 S.Ct. 176, 69 L.Ed. 352 (1925), is not authority for a broad\nreading of Debs. While it permitted the United States, without specific statutory authorization, to sue to enjoin the\noperation of a municipal sewage system endangering navigation on the Great Lakes, the Debs elements of\ncommerce and nuisance were both present and there were both a treaty and a federal statute defining the\ninterests to be protected.\nExcept for Brand Jewelers, no court has interpreted Debs as broadly as we are asked to do in the instant case. In\nthis circuit we have held that the United States may sue to effect recovery of federal funds improperly disbursed. \nWilson Clinic & Hospital, Inc. v. Blue Cross of South Carolina, 494 F.2d 50 (4 Cir. 1974). We have held that the\nUnited States may sue to enforce immunity of the armed forces to certain state taxes in accordance with a\ncongressionally authorized program relating to national defense. United States v. Arlington County, 326 F.2d 929\n(4 Cir. 1964). In United States v. Marchetti, 466 F.2d 1309 (4 Cir. 1972),cert. denied,409 U.S. 1063, 93 S.Ct.\n553, 34 L.Ed.2d 516 (1972), we held that the interest of the United States in national security where it had\n[5]\ncontractual rights to protect that interest permitted it to sue without explicit authority.  In all of these cases, the\nUnited States had a property interest to be protected or there was a well-defined statutory interest of the public at\nlarge to be protected. In United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d 655 (4 Cir. 1953),aff'd on other grounds,\n348 U.S. 296, 75 S.Ct. 326, 99 L.Ed. 329 (1955), we held that the United States could not maintain an action for\nbreach of a trade agreement setting import quotas in the absence of express authorization by Congress and\nwhen the agreement was in violation of a statute dealing with the matter to which it was related.\nThe instant case is one in the field of civil rights and in this area nonstatutory authority on the part of the\ngovernment to sue has been upheld in cases where the government sought to desegregate public facilities on the\nground that segregated facilities constituted an obstruction to the flow of interstate commerce and Congress has\n\n1128 exercised its power to outlaw such conduct. *1128United States v. Original Knights of the KuKlux Klan, 250\nF.Supp. 330 (E.D.La.1965) (alternative holding); United States v.

State of Mississippi, 229 F.Supp. 925 (S.D.Miss.1964) (three-judge court)\n(Brown, J., dissenting), rev'd, 380 U.S. 128, 85 S.Ct. 808, 13 L.Ed.2d 717 (1965).\nWhere, however, there was no basis on which to claim that interstate commerce was obstructed by a denial of\ncivil rights in violation of some congressional enactment, four courts have held that the government lacks\nnonstatutory authority to sue. United States v. County School Board of Prince George County, 221 F.Supp. 93\n(E.D.Va.1963); United States v. Biloxi Municipal School District, 219 F.Supp. 691 (S.D.Miss.1963),and United\nStates v. Madison County Board of Education, 219 F.Supp. 60 (N.D.Ala.1963),both affirmed on other grounds,\n326 F.2d 237 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 929, 85 S.Ct. 324, 13 L.Ed.2d 341 (1964); United States v. School\nDistrict of Ferndale, 406 F.Supp. 1122 (E.D.Mich.1975). See also United States v. Mattson, CV 74-138-BU\n(D.Mont.1976) (holding same relying on district court opinion in this case).\nWe consider United States v. Brand Jewelers, Inc., 318 F.Supp. 1293 (S.D.N.Y.1971), which has been criticized\nin 84 Harv.L.Rev. 1930 (1971); 37 Brooklyn L.Rev. 426 (1971); 17 Wayne L.Rev. 1287 (1971). It held that the\nUnited States has nonstatutory authority to sue in a case where there was a claim of an obstruction to commerce\ngenerally but no claim of violation of any statute enacted to protect commerce, and, alternatively, a claim of denial\nof due process of law. In Brand Jewelers, the principal defendant was engaged in the retail sale of jewelry mostly\non credit. It was alleged that debtors were deprived of their property without due process of law by defendant's\npractice of obtaining judgments for customer defaults in payments without proper service of suit papers and by\nfalse affidavits of service. On motion to dismiss, the nonstatutory right of the government to sue was sustained\nbecause of its allegation that Brand Jewelers' business scheme00that of retail sales on credit, the fraudulent\n97\nobtention of judgments for unpaid balances and the subsequent garnishment of wages00constituted a burden on\n97\ninterstate commerce and that it constituted a denial of due process of law. Giving Debs an extreme reading, the\nCourt reasoned that since the United States had authority to remove substantial burdens on interstate commerce\nand to correct deprivations of property without due process of law, albeit both unexercised in the areas of Brand\nJewelers' practices, the government could sue.\nWe decline to follow Brand Jewelers and we decline to hold that in the absence of specific authority the United\nStates may sue in the instant case. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96\nL.Ed. 1153 (1952)00the so-called \"Steel Seizure Case\"00is one of the reasons for our decision. It raised the\n97 97\nquestion of whether the President had the authority to seize the nation's steel industry in an effort to prevent a\ncrippling steel strike during the Korean War. Because the President had no statutory or constitutional authority to\nseize the mills, the Court held that the seizure was illegal and improper.\nThe case is important here because of the light that it sheds on the doctrine of separation of powers. It stressed\nthat the concept forbade the conclusion that the President acted properly, because to sustain his action would be\n1129 to permit him to make law since *1129 he did not otherwise have the authority to act and that, in turn, would\nviolate the provision of the Constitution assigning legislative powers to the Congress. Mr. Justice Jackson, while\nhe concurred in the Court's opinion, also wrote a separate concurrence and he, too, stressed that when the\nexecutive acts in an area in which he has neither explicit nor implicit statutory authority, \"what is at stake is the\nequilibrium established by our constitutional system.\" 343 U.S. at 638, 72 S.Ct. at 871.\nIn the instant case, if we were to read Debs to authorize this suit, we would not only permit the executive to take\naction for which we have concluded he is neither explicitly nor impliedly authorized to take, we would also\nauthorize the executive to do what Congress has repeatedly declined to authorize him to do. See n. 4, supra.\nMoreover, we would do so in an area where considerations of federalism and comity are also present. Although\nthe instant case is a suit against certain officials of Rosewood, its effect on the State of Maryland is manifest.\n\nCongressional concern with federal-state relations in the area of civil rights is sufficiently great that we are\nreluctant to sustain nonstatutory executive acts in all but the clearest case.\nIn addition, there is in this case no factor of interstate commerce. Nor can it be said that, as abhorrent as\nmaltreatment of the mentally deficient would be if proved, the immediate victims constitute \"the public at large,\" or\nthat the situation constitutes a national emergency.\nFor all of these reasons, therefore, we do not think that Debs may be relied on to sustain the present suit.\nAFFIRMED.\nBUTZNER, Circuit Judge, concurring:\nI concur specially to emphasize that this case has been decided on narrow grounds. The government brought\nsuit to enjoin the violation of rights secured to present and prospective mentally retarded patients of Rosewood\nState Hospital by the eighth, thirteenth, and fourteenth amendments. I agree that this suit \"is not one against the\nState of Maryland to enforce the condition of a grant or for breach of a contract pursuant to which a grant was\nmade.\" P. 1125.\nEvidence proffered by the government shows that between 1973 and 1975 Rosewood received more than $14\nmillion in federal grants designed to aid the mentally retarded. To secure these funds the state was required to\ncomply with the constitutional provisions, laws, and regulations governing their disbursal. If the government had\nbrought suit to enforce the conditions of the grants or for breach of contract, quite a different question might well\nhave been presented. It has long been recognized that the United States has implied authority to sue for\nvindication of its proprietary and contractual interests in grants that it has made. United States v. San Jacinto Tin\nCo., 125 U.S. 273, 279-85, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1888) (land grant); United States v. Bell Telephone Co.,\n128 U.S. 315, 356-73, 9 S.Ct. 90, 32 L.Ed. 450 (1888) (patent); United States v. San Francisco, 310 U.S. 16,\n29-30, 60 S.Ct. 749, 84 L.Ed. 1050 (1940) (land grant); United States v. County School Board of Prince George\nCounty, Va., 221 F.Supp. 93, 103 (E.D.Va.1963) (educational impact funds); United States v. Frazer, 297 F.Supp.\n319, 322-24 (M.D.Ala.1968), 317 F.Supp. 1079, 1082-84 (M.D.Ala.1970) (grant-in-aid programs).\n[1] In its brief in this court, the United States makes reference to additional legislation evidencing congressional\naction with respect to the field of mental retardation, viz: 7 U.S.C. § 1431 (surplus food for various institutions,\nincluding hospitals for mentally disabled persons); 42 U.S.C. § 1761 (school lunch programs for institutionalized\nchildren); and 20 U.S.C. § 1401 (education for handicapped children). Attention is called also to the regulations of\nHEW, 45 C.F.R. §§ 249.12 and 249.13, establishing standards relating to the treatment of beneficiaries of\nMedicare and Medicare programs, which were adopted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(c) and (d).\n[2] The Reviser's Notes to § 516 state that \"[t]he words `Except as otherwise authorized by law are added to\nprovide for existing and future exceptions (e. g., section 1037 of title 10).\" In the instant case, no party claims that\nanyone is authorized to bring suit except through the Attorney General.\n[3] The pertinent language of the report follows: \nThe conference substitute contains a compromise which enumerates Congressional findings respecting the rights\nof persons with developmental disabilities. These include findings that the developmentally disabled have a right\nto appropriate treatment, services and habilitation; that such treatment, services and habilitation should be\ndesigned to maximize the developmental potential of the person and be provided in the setting that is least\nrestrictive to his personal liberty; that the Federal government and the States have an obligation to assure that\npublic funds are not provided in programs which do not provide appropriate treatment, services and habilitation or\ndo not meet minimum standards respecting diet, medical and dental services, use of restraints, visiting hours and\ncompliance with fire and safety codes; and that programs for the developmentally disabled should meet\nappropriate standards including standards adjusted for the size of the institutions which are at least comparable\nto those promulgated under title 19 of the Social Security Act. These rights are generally included in the\nconference substitute in recognition by the conferees that the developmentally disabled, particularly those who\nhave the misfortune to require institutionalization, have a right to receive appropriate treatment for the conditions\n\nfor which they are institutionalized, and that this right should be protected and assured by the Congress and the\ncourts. (Emphasis added.)\n[4] It is significant that several attempts extending over a period of twenty years to enact legislation empowering\nthe Attorney General to bring the type of action represented by the instant case have failed of enactment. In\nregard to the Civil Rights Act of 1957, see Letter of Herbert Brownell, Jr., Attorney General, to the Speaker of the\nHouse, H.R. 291, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., [1957] U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1966, 1978-80. In regard to the\nCivil Rights Act of 1960, see H.R. 956, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., [1960] U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1925,\n1953-54. In regard to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see H.R. 914, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., [1964] U.S.Code Cong. &\nAdmin.News 2355, 2392, 2450. \nEven when there is no legislative history to show that during this period Congress considered granting authority\nsufficiently broad to authorize suit in the instant case, it nevertheless extended the Attorney General's authority to\nsue. Thus, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 contains authority for the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief to\nprevent enforcement of the poll tax. 42 U.S.C. § 1973h(c). See 42 U.S.C. § 1973j; 42 U.S.C. § 1973a. But see\nH.Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (additional views of John Lindsay); [1965] U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News\nat 2483-84, and 111 Cong.Rec. 16263-16265 (1965) (rejecting amendment allowing suits to enjoin interference\nwith first amendment rights). Other authorizations are contained in the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970\n(42 U.S.C. § 1973aa-2, § 1973bb-2), the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (adding 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e-5(f), but transferring other functions to EEOC, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-6(c), (d), (e)), and the Voting Rights Act\nAmendments of 1975 (Attorney General's authority extended to include suits with regard to Spanish-speaking\ncitizens).\nFinally, we note that there are presently pending in the current Congress S. 1393 and H.R. 2439, 95th Cong., 1st\nSess., legislative authorization for suits like the instant case.\n[5] In New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971), suit was\npredicated upon the assertion that it was necessary for the United States to sue to protect national security and\nforeign relations. Unlike Marchetti, there was no claim that the United States had contractual rights which it was\nallegedly protecting. Since the New York Times conceded the government's right to sue, the issue was not\nlitigated. The opinions of the several justices, however, disclosed an awareness and concern with regard to the\ngovernment's right to sue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

NElL SOLOMON, et al.\nDefendants-Appellees\nOn Appeal from the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\nThe issue presented by this appeal in its broadest terms\nis whether the district court erred in its pre-trial dismissal\nof a complaint brought by the Attorney General on behalf of\nthe United States for injunctive relief against an alleged\npattern and practice of continuing deprivations of basic constitu-\ntional rights of mentally retarded citizens confined in a Maryland\nstate hospital. This issue can be divided into two parts:\n\n-2-\n(I) _ether the Attorney General has the authority\nto bring suit to represent the interests of the United\nStates without a statutory authorization in specific terms,\nand\n(2) Whether the United States has any interests in this\ncase sufficient to give it standing to sue.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Procedural History\nThis action was brought on February 21, 1974, by the\nUnited States government, acting through the Attorney General\nof the United States, against three officials of the State of\nMaryland who are responsible for the operation of the Rose-\nwood State Hospital, a hospital where mentally retarded\ncitizens are confined for the purpose of habilitative treat-\nment (App. 2-8). The complaint alleges that no such treatment\nis, in fact, provided and that the circumstances and conditions\nof the confinement of mentally retarded persons are such that\nthey are denied basic rights assured to them by the Eighth,\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment_ to the Constitution of\nthe United States. No answer to the complaint was filed. Dis-\ncovery took place from June 27, 1974, through May 20, 1976\n(R. 15-392). On April 27, 1976, defendants moved to dismiss\n\njv\n-3-\nthe complaint claiming that the United States had no\nauthority to maintain this action (App. 9-10). On July 8,\n1976, the district court entered an opinion and order dis-\nmissing the complaint (App. 11-40), and judgment was entered\naccordingly (App. 41). On September 3, 1976, the United States\nappealed to this court from the district court's dismissal\n(App. 42).\nB. Factual Alienations\nThere has been no trial on the merits or other evidentiary\nhearing in this case, and a motion of the United States seek-\ning to present evidence in support of its opposition to the\ndefendants' motion to dismiss was denied (R. 441). However,\nthe facts which the government contends justify its standing\nto prosecute this action, and which could be proved at trial\nare contained in the allegations of the complaint and in the\nmaterials assembled in the discovery process.\nRosewood State Hospital, located at Owings Mill, Maryland\nwas established and is operated by officials of the State of\nMaryland for the purpose of providing treatment and habilita-\ntive care to mentally retarded persons. At the time the com-\nplaint was filed there were approximately 2400 persons housed\nat Rosewood. The complaint alleges that mentally retarded\n\npersons can be and are involuntarily committed to and con-\nfined in Rosewood State Hospital. It is alleged that\ndefendants, who have the responsibility for the operation\nof Rosewood, have failed to provide the treatment and\nhabilitative care to residents which is the sole purpose for\nconfinement of persons to Rosewood. (App. 5) The complaint\nalleges that this failure falls so far below what is minimally\nadequate for such confined individuals that the rights of\nthose individuals under the Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth\nAmendments are infringed. (App.7) The complaint alleges that\ndefendants have failed to provide humane living conditions by:\n(a) Failing or refusing to recruit, employ, and train\ndirect care personnel in sufficient numbers to supervise the\ndaily life activities of Rosewood residents, provide proper\ncustodial care, and prevent such residents from inflicting\nphysical harm upon themselves or others;\n(b) Failing or refusing to inculcate in Rosewood residents\nbehavioral.and social skills sufficient to enable such residents\nto restrain themselves from antisocial or dangerous conduct,\nand to care for their own personal and hygienic needs;\n(c) Authorizing, permitting, or failing or refusing to\nprevent the seclusion of Rosewood residents in locked rooms\nor cells for extended periods of time;\n\n-5-\n(d) Failing or refusing to provide Rosewood residents\nwith living or sleeping space sufficient to insure protec-\ntion from physical harm at the hands of others and a modicum\nof privacy and human dignity; and\n(e) Failing or refusing to provide Rosewood residents\nwith clean, odor-free, safe, and sanitary living and sleep-\ning areas, and failing or refusing to maintain sanitary and\nminimally adequate kitchen and laundry facilities. (App.5-6)\nThe complaint also makes reference to the interest of\nthe United States in halting the described practices as\nevidenced by a Presidential statement and federal statutes\nproviding for the care and treatment of the mentally retarded.\n(App. 7) Most of these statutes provide for federal funds to\nbe made available for the care and treatment of the mentally\nretarded, and the record contains'a submlssion made to the\ndistrict court indicating the amount and governmental source\nof federal funds made available to Rosewood immediately before\nand after the filing of the complaint:\n\n-6-\nHealth, Education\nFiscal Year and Welfare Champus-- Agriculture\n1975 5,610,936.00 12,732.87 6,933.09\n1974 4,098,710.00 77,814o61 29,671.34\n1973 4,224,182o00 30,289.72 41,376.94\n(R., Unnumbered Jacket, Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants'\nMotion to Dismiss, Addendum B).\nIn addition, it is submitted that significant sums of\nmoney have been provided to a variety of programs for the\ncare and training of the mentally retarded, generally. (R.,\nUnnumbered Jacket, Supplemental Submission of the United States\nin Support of Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, Tab C.)\nFinally, it is alleged that the practices, unless enjoined\nwill continue in derogation of national policy. (App. 7-8)\nDetails of the conditions under which Rosewood residents\nare required to live have been gathered through discovery and\nthese details were summarized in submissions to the district\ncourt in opposition to motion to dismiss. (Ro, Unnumbered\nJacket, Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, Adden-\ndum A) Based upon this, it appears that, at trial, numerous\n!/ A program operated through the Department of Defense to\nreimburse mental health facilities which undertake to provide\nhabilitative treatment for military dependents entitled to\nmilitary health care.\n\n-7-\nexamples of the constitutional deficiency of Rosewood could\nbe proved, e.g. excessive use of behavior drugs solely for\ncontrol, overpopulation and understaffing, lack of psychiatric\ntreatment and therapy, idleness, unsanitary conditions,\narbitrary confinements, infectious diseases, and physical\ninjury and deaths resulting from a combination of conditions.\nINTRODUCTION AND SUbIMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe plaintiff contends that where the authority of the\nAttorney General, • or the standing of the United States, to bring\na civil action without specific statutory authorization is called\ninto question, the case should be controlled by the application\nof two legal principles:\n(I) That the Attorney General is the appropriate official to\nrepresent the United States in the courts, and to bring action\non behalf of the United States; and (2) That the Attorney General\nmay bring civil actions on behalf of the United States if there\nare sufficient \"interests\" to give the government standing. These\nare the controlling principles found in numerous judicial opinions.\nIn Part-I of this brief, it is argued that•the Attorney General\nhas authority to bring this civil action if theUnited States has\nsufficient interest to vindicate, and that it was erroneous for\nthe district court to treat the issue as one involving the reaches\n\n-8-\nof executive power. Clearly, if suit may be brought, the\nexecutive is the branch of government to bring such suit.\nWhether suit may be brought depends upon the standing of the\ngovernment which, in turn, depends upon whether there is a\ngovernmental \"interest\" at stake.\nPart II contains a description of those interests which\nthe United States has in this case which give it standing\nto sue for injunctive relief. These interests lie in the\nexecution of a policy and program enacted by Congress providing\nfor the care and treatment of mentally retarded persons\nand in the protection of their rights, in the constitutional\nintegrity of federal spending programs to which conditions re-\ngarding treatment of the beneficiaries of those programs have been\nattached by Congress and in the removal of systematic and\ninstitutionalized deprivations of Thirteenth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights which \"affect the public at large\".\nBecause the district court did not give appropriate weight\nto those \"interests\", it erred in dismissing the complaint, and\nshould be reversed.\n\nr_\n-9-\nARGUb_NT\nI. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL _Y FILE AND PROSECUTE CIVIL\nACTIONS IN THE COURTS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE IN-\nTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNmeNT\nThis action was brought by the United States, acting\nthrough the Attorney General, against officials responsible\nfor operating Rosewood Hospital, a facility of the State of\nMaryland for the training and habilitation of mentally re-\ntarded persons, many of whom are involuntarily confined there. 2/\nThere is ample authority that the constitutional rights of the\nmentally retarded which are cited in the complaint may be\nappropriately protected by actions in federal court for in-\njunctive relief. Wyatt v. Aderholt_ 503 F.2d 1305, 1316\n(C.A. 5 1974). This proposition was not challenged by the\ndefendants in their motion to dismiss, and the district\n_/ See Annotated Code of Maryland, Art. 59A, §§1-17.\n\n-10-\ncourt, in dismissing the complaint, acknowledged as much\n(App. 13). The district court held, however, that the\nexecutive branch of the federal government has no authority\nto institute this action.\nUnquestionably, under 18 U.S.C. 516-5193_/, the Attorney\nGeneral is the appropriate officer to bring suit on behalf\nof the federal government and to represent the government\nin litigation where the government has an \"interest\". Section\n516 reserves to the Attorney General the authority to conduct,\nor to supervise the conducting of, litigation in which the\nUnited States has an interest. Section 518(b) gives the\nAttorney General the authority to either personally conduct,\nOr to direct other officers of the Department of Justice to\nconduct and argue cases in which the United States is interested.\nSection 519 gives the Attorney General the authority to super-\nvise all litigation in which the United States is a party.\nWe have no disagreement with the district court's statement\nthat these statutes do not say anything about what litigation\nthe government may have an \"interest\" in. (App. 15-16) They\ndo, however, provide congressional support for the long reeog-\n.n_zed view that the Attorney General has the authority to\n_/ Statutes relevant to this case are reproduced in an addendum\nto this brief.\n\n-ll-\ninstitute litigation when the United States has an \"interest\"\nat stake. Dugan v. United States, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 172\n(1818); United States v. Tingey, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115 (1831);\nCotton v. United States, 52 U.S. (II How.) 229 (1850)\nIt seems equally clear that, if the United States has a\njudicially cognizable governmental or pecuniary interest, the\nAttorney General needs no statute specifically authorizing\nhim to prosecute this civil action.\nIn the absence of some legislative direction to\nthe contrary..., the general authority of the\nAttorney General in respect of those pleas of the\nUnited States and the litigation which is necessary\ntoestablish and safeguard its rights affords ample\nwarrant for the institution and prosecution by him\nof a suit such as this. Kern River Co. v. United\nStates, 257 U.S. 147, 155 (1921)\nThe Kern River Co. case was one where a sufficient interest\nl'f\non the part of the government was found in the allocation of\nrights of way across public lands. Interests sufficient for\nthe government to initiate and maintain litigation without\nspecific statutory authority have been present in a variety\nof matters of a governmental nature._/\ni/ E.__ suits to revoke a fraudulantly obtained patent.

In Re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 584 (1895) quoted\nat 362 F.2d 932.\nThe district court, in this case, recognized that there\nare instances where the United States, acting through the\nAttorney General, may bring suit without specific statutory\nauthority, and even recognized that there is statutory authority\nin the Attorney General to represent the \"interests\" of the\nUnited States in the Courts. (App. 16) The district court\ndid not, however, analyze whether there are any protectable\ninterests of the United States present in this case, and\nit failed to apply the principles found in the case law\nfor testing whether a judicially cognizable interest exists.\nInstead, the district court viewed the issue as one of\nexecutive power, and read the existing authorities as recogniz-\ning a power in the executive branch to bring suit in case if\nan \"emergency public nuisance\" or in \"dire emergencies.\"\n\n(App. 20, 24, 40) But not one case cited in the district\ncourt opinion rested its holding on such a rationaleS/\nIn Part I_ infra, the three aspects of this case which,\nin combination, give rise to a litigable interest on the part\nof the United States, left undiscussed by the district court,\nare described. Summarily stated, they are: (I) the statutory\nenactments of Congress, applicable to Rosewood, which\nestablish the national policy regarding the protection of the\nrights of the mentally retarded administratively and through\nthe courts; (2) the federal tax funds which have been spent\nin programs for the mentally retarded generally, and which\nhave been spent at Rosewood, the receipt of which is condi-\ntioned upon providing certain standards of treatment; and (3)\nthe interest of the federal government, recognized by Congress,\nto vindicate systematic de,privations of rights secured by the\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Admendments to the United States\nConstitution.\nThe district court cited the Federalist Papers for the point\nthat the federal government has no powers not given it by the\nConstitution (App. 14), a principle beyond dispute, but those\nworks, which spoke of a strong and independent executive, see\nFederalist, Nos. 48, 73, 78, are also relevant to a discussion\nof executive power, a central theme of the district court opinion.\n\nIt is axomatic, of course, that where Congress has\nenacted statutes which describe the scope of permissible\nlitigation on behalf of the government, those statutes con-\ntrol whether any given suit will lle. In this case, however,\nthere is no such statute. Nor, as we contend in Part II, is\nthere any action by Congress which is inconsistent with the\nposition which the government takes in this case. Where this\nstate of statutory law obtains, the appropriate inquiry, in\ndeciding whether the Attorney General may bring suit, is to\ndecide whether the government has any substantial interest to\nadvance._/ If there is such an interest, then there is no doubt\nthat under the statutes and the case law, the Attorney General,\nand 6nly the Attorney General, may bring suit on behalf of the\nUnited States. If not, then no element of the government may\nbring suit. It is of little assistance to dwell on the difference\nbetween Congressional and executive power when there is no con-\nflict between them presented.\nNor is there a reason to raise the spectre of unlimited\n6_ \"The government can sue even if there is no specific authoriza-\ntion.

United States, 224 U.S. 413, 443 (1911).\nThis record rebuts the conclusion, reached by the\ndistrict court, (App. 34) that Congress intended the Secretary\nof Health, Education and Welfare to be the sole enforcer of the\nrights of mentally retarded persons to the exclusion of the\ncourts and the Attorney General. In any event, the normal\nrule of construction is that where Congress intends an executive\nremedy to be exclusive in derogation of other existing remedies,\nit must say so explicitly. United States v. Witte!___, 337 U.S. 346,\n359-60 (194.8) United States v. Stevenson, 215 U.S. 190, 198,\n(1909). This, Congress has not done, but it has made manifest\nthe government's law enforcement interest in the subject matter\nof this suit.\nB. The United States has an interest in the\nconstitutional integrity of its spending\nprograms.\nIn one sense, it is a misnomer to call this a non-statutory\nsuit. As established in the preceding section, there are\nnumerous statutes establishing a federal policy of protecting\nthe mentally retarded. The most direct means Congress has adopted\nto carry out this policy is through the provision of federal\n\nfunds for the purpose of providing treatment through state\nauthorities. These funds have conditions attached which\nrelate to the standards for treatment which must be provided.\nThe complaint in this case, which makes allegations of con-\nditions at Rosewood far below any acceptable standards for\ntreatment of the mentally retarded, also recites the govern-\nment's interest as reflected in the Medicaid program as it\napplies to Rosewood residents. 42 U.S.C. 1396d (c) & (d).\nSubmissions to the district court reflect that Rosewood has\nreceived over 13 million dollars over the last three years\nfrom the Department of Health, Education and Welfare through\nthe Medicaid program. Statutes provide that funds such as\nthis may be expended if the primary purpose of the institu-\ntion in question is \"to provide health or rehabilitative\nservices,\" it meets standards \"prescribed by the Secretary\n[of Health, Education and Welfare]\" and the individuals for\nwhom payment is sought are \"receiving active treatment.\"\n42 UoS.C. 1396d (d).\nPursuant to this statute, and the authority conferred\nby 42 U.S.C. 1302, the Secretary has prescribed \"Standards for\nIntermediate Care Facilities.\" 45 C.F.R. §249.12. These\nstandards include requirement s that institutions such as\n\n-27-\nRosewood maintain sufficient staff to carry out the policies,\nresponsibilities and programs of the facility; that written\npolicies provide, inter alia, for the rights of residents and\nprohibit their mistreatment and abuse; that the facility be\nin conformity with Federal, State and local laws pertaining to\nhealth and safety; that there be regulation of physical re-\nstraints, chemical restraints, living space, medication and\ndiet; and that they provide necessary training in living and\nself-help skills, physical and occupational therapy, psychologi-\ncal services, speech pathology and audiology and other services\nappropriate to such institutions.\nThe complaint in this case makes allegations of insufficient\nstaff, lack of psychiatric and social services, inhumane, un-\nsanitary and crowded living conditions and a general lack of\nadequate treatment. If the allegations are true, the condi-\ntions at Rosewood violate both the regulations and the Medicaid\nstatutes, as well as the constitution. This suit, of course,\nis one to enforce constitutional standards. But where the\nstatutory standards require adequate treatment, and so does the\nConstitution, the interest of the government in enforcing those\nstandards is clear. The regulations may require more than due\n\n-28-\nprocess considerations; they are, however, instructive as to\nminimal requirements as viewed by those with expertise respecting\nthe needs of the mentally ret_rded.\nThe interest of the government in enforcing conditions\nattached to its grants has been repeatedly recognized as\nbeing sufficient to maintain suit without statutory authority.\nUnited States v. Frazier, 297 F. Supp. 319, 323 (M.D. Ala.\n1968) supplementary opinion, 317 F. Supp. 1079; Griffin v.\nUnited States_ 168 F.2d 457, 459 (G.A. 8 1948); United States\nv.

The federal government\nis financing an institution which, under the complaint, is\nabridging the constitutional rights of the persons confined\n,\nto that institution. The governments duty to obey constitu-\ntional commands, if nothing else, Frontiero v. Richardson,\n411 U.S. 677 (1973), gives rise to more than sufficient in-\nterest to maintain this litigation.\nIt would be incongruous to say that the Congress has the\nauthority to require that adequate treatment for the mentally\nretarded be a condition of receiving federal funds, as it\nclearly does, King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968); United States\nv. San Francisco, 310 U.S. 16 (1940), but that the executive\nbranch is limited in the performance of its duty to \"take care\n,!\nthat the laws be faithfully executed_ _ to the inflexible,\n_/United States Constitution, Article II, Section 3.\n\n-30-\nbut statutorily authorized measure of terminating the flow\nof funds2_ intended to secure the rights of the mentally\nretarded. Such a limitation of power has never been presumed,\nIn Re Nestle I 135 U.S. i, 63-66 (1890), and if Congress intended\nto take away from the government standing to file suit in courts_\nit cannot do so by simply failing to grant authority. United\nStates v. California, 332 U.S. 19, 27-28 (1947).\nThe government, therefore, contends that it has sufficient\ninterest to sue not only to enforce statutorily defined policies\nand conditions attached to the award of federal grants, but also\nto insure the constitutional integrity of grants.\nC. The govermment has an interest in vindication\nof systematic and institutionalized depriva-\ntion of Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights whichaffect the public at large.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly, the United States\nhas an interest in the vindication of systematic deprivations\nof rights secured by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments\n24/ See district court opinion (App. 34-35).\n\n-31-\nto the Constitution of the United States. Congress has\n•acted in substantial and detailed terms over the last two\ndecades to enforce these Amendments.2___ But the most broadly\nworded legislatio n was the legislation of the 1860's and\n1870's, the important parts of which survive as R.S. §§1977-\n198_/ and 18 U.S.C. 241 and 242. These statutes recognized\nthe importance which both civil and criminal litigation plays\nin developing and vindicating the rights declared by the\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, and most of the judicial\ninterpretation of these Amendments has been in cases brought\npursuant to these statutes.\nThe executive branch of the government has the respon-\nsibility to bring criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. 241\nand 242 where appropriate. These are broadly worded, and are\nin pari materia to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985 which provide for\ncivil action to redress the same conduct made criminal under\nSection 241 and 242. Baldwin v.

(App. 26-27) But the\nAttorney General does not assert in this case such a sweeping\npower. Rather, what is asserted is that the government has\nan interest to vindicate in court.
