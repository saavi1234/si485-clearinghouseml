    "summary": "<p>Involuntarily unhoused residents of Chico, California, filed this lawsuit against the City of Chico and the City of Chico Police Department, challenging the City&rsquo;s ordinances that criminalized homelessness by banning camping and storing personal property in public places. Represented by attorneys from Legal Services of Northern California, on April 8, 2021, eight individuals sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and alleged violations of their rights guaranteed by the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments in the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs brought suit in the Eastern District of California. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining the City of Chico from enforcing ordinances that punished people for camping on public property when there was no alternative shelter available, and also enjoining the City from destroying the property of unhoused people. The case was initially assigned to Judge Kimberly J. Mueller, but she recused herself, and it was reassigned to Senior Judge Morrison C. England, Jr.; in 2024, it was reassigned to Judge Dale A. Drozd.</p>\r\n<p><br />The plaintiffs alleged that due to a lack of alternative shelter for unhoused people in Chico, 66% of Chico&rsquo;s homeless population was unsheltered. The plaintiffs further argued that, because Chico did not have available alternative shelter for unhoused people, the city ordinances that criminalized camping in public violated their constitutional rights. According to the complaint, the Chico ordinances criminalized homelessness by making it unlawful to (1) camp on any public property or private property that was not a designated campground; (2) store private property on parks, streets, public parking lots, or near waterways; (3) sit on sidewalks in commercial districts; (4) obstruct entrances to buildings; and (5) obstruct sidewalk traffic. The plaintiffs alleged that the Chico police enforced the ordinancesse by warning unhoused residents to move and threatening arrest if they refused to move. They further alleged that between 2018 and 2020, Chico police made 120 arrests for violations of the anti-camping ordinance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The plaintiffs argued that the ordinance that criminalized camping in public violated their Eighth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution by punishing them for life-sustaining activities such as sleeping in public, and also violated their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the California Constitution. They also argued that the defendants&rsquo; practice of forcibly removing plaintiffs from encampments and forcing them to sleep on rights-of-way with only a sleeping bag was a &ldquo;state-created danger&rdquo; that violated the California Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. They further contended that the defendants&rsquo; seizure of property was unlawful under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. They also argued that the anti-camping ordinances violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; due process rights under the California Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because the City failed to inform the public about what speech or conduct would subject them to criminal penalties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2021, the plaintiffs filed ex parte motions to proceed in forma pauperis (&ldquo;IFP&rdquo;; i.e., an indigent status that would allow the court to waive their costs and fees). On April 10, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order with an accompanying memorandum supporting it. On April 11, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Whereas the initial complaint sought only injunctive relief, the amended complaint also sought declaratory relief in which the court declared that their rights had been violated. That same day, the court granted the temporary restraining order in favor of the plaintiffs. The temporary restraining order prohibited the City of Chico and its police department from enforcing notifications that gave unhoused community members at Comance Green Way 72 hours to remove their belongings and leave the location, and from issuing or enforcing similar notifications. The temporary restraining order also barred the defendants from enforcing or threatening to enforce specific municipal ordinances, including the bans on camping and storing personal property in public. It also prohibited the defendants from destroying the personal property of unhoused individuals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motions to proceed IFP on April 15, 2021. On April 23, 2021, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction, which was continued to May 14, 2021. The court ordered the temporary restraining order to remain in effect until May 14. On May 10, Judge England continued the preliminary injunction hearing until June. In June, the preliminary injunction hearing was continued again, and the temporary restraining order remained in effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, 2021, the court heard arguments on the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. The court agreed to extend the temporary restraining order until it determined the outcome of the preliminary injunction motion. During these proceedings, the parties agreed to have the case referred to a magistrate judge for a settlement conference, and the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />On July 8, 2021, Judge England granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction, converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction on the same terms. In granting the preliminary injunction, Judge England concluded that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits under 9th Circuit precedent, <em>Martin v. City of Boise</em>, 920 F.3d 584, (9th Cir. 2024), which held that under the Eighth Amendment, a jurisdiction could not prosecute homeless people for involuntary sitting, lying, or sleeping in public when there were more homeless individuals than shelter beds available in the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Beginning in August 2021, the court held multiple settlement conferences throughout the remainder of the calendar year. In January 2022, the parties reached a settlement agreement and filed a proposed order for dismissal, which Judge England signed the following day, dismissing the entire action with prejudice. Chico residents sent letters and emails to the court asking Judge England to refuse to sign the current settlement agreement, which they argued was overly generous to the homeless community and burdened taxpayers. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the City was required to construct the Chico Emergency Non-Congregate Housing Site (&ldquo;Housing Site&rdquo;) with at least 50 pallet shelters, personal hygiene facilities, and potable drinking water and meal services. The City also agreed not to enforce its anti-camping bans and not to require a homeless person to relocate their property until the Housing Site was open and available as alternative housing. When the Housing Site was open, the City agreed that it would require a homeless person to relocate their property or themselves only if it had assessed that there was available alternative shelter and it had given prior notice to the individual. The City also agreed that it would dismiss all administrative and criminal citations and charges against the plaintiffs related to their status as homeless. The City agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of $12,000 in damages and to pay plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel $650,000 in attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman would oversee the implementation and enforcement of the settlement agreement for a period of five years from its effective date.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The City opened the Housing Site in 2022, and by the end of April of that year, Magistrate Judge Newman declared that the city could begin to enforce the ordinances following the terms provided in the settlement agreement, as noted above. On August 25, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. On February 24, 2023, Magistrate Judge Newman issued an order after an informal conference, declaring that the City must offer three alternative sites to unhoused individuals when enforcing its ordinances and that when a homeless person goes to one of those alternative sites, the City was not allowed to enforce against that person again for at least 60 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 5, 2024, this action was reassigned to Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn K. Delaney, in light of Magistrate Judge Newman&rsquo;s upcoming retirement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States announced its decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/43966/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, Oregon, 144 S.Ct. 2022 (2024)</a>, which held that enforcing bans on sleeping or camping on public property was not prohibited &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishment&rdquo; under the Eighth Amendment. In light of the <em>Grants Pass</em> decision, the City of Chico filed a motion for relief from the injunction on August 31, 2024. In their reply brief, the plaintiffs argued that by filing the motion for relief from final judgment, the defendants were engaging in an improper attempt to circumvent the dispute resolution process that they had agreed to in the settlement agreement, which required the parties to meet informally and attend a conference with the magistrate judge before attempting to modify the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2024, this action was randomly reassigned to District Judge A. Drozd, and as of that date, District Judge Morrison C. England, Jr., was no longer associated with this case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of December 4, 2024, the City of Chico&rsquo;s motion for relief from the preliminary injunction was pending before Judge Drozd.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "On April 8, 2021, involuntarily unhoused residents of Chico, California, who were represented by Legal Services of Northern California, filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the City of Chico, California and the City of Chico Police Department, challenging the constitutionality of city ordinances that criminalized homelessness by banning camping and storing personal property in public places. The complaint alleged that due to insufficient shelter space in Chico, unhoused residents were forced to sleep outside. They argued that Chicoโs ordinances that criminalized doing so violated their rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and injunctive relief enjoining the City of Chico from enforcing these ordinances and from destroying the property of unhoused people. The court granted a temporary restraining order, which was then converted into a preliminary injunction. The parties reached a settlement agreement on January 22, 2022, which required the City to open a new housing site to provide alternative shelter to its unhoused residents before it could continue to enforce or threaten to force its bans on camping and storing personal property in public places. In light of the Supreme Courtโs 2024 decision in Johnson v. City of Grants Pass, Oregon, 144 S.Ct. 2022 (2024), which held that enforcing bans on sleeping or camping on public property was not prohibited โcruel and unusual punishmentโ under the Eighth Amendment, the City of Chico filed a motion for relief from the preliminary injunction; as of December 4, 2024, that motion is pending before the court.",

If the \n28  Parties are unable to reach agreement, then they shall submit this dispute for resolution to the dispute \n \n8 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  resolution process outlined in Paragraph 16 of this Agreement.  The Housing Siteโs written policies \n2  shall comport with all of the following and all other sections of this Agreement: \n3  a.  The City and/or Housing Site Operator may have a preference for admission for \n4  Homeless Persons who reside in the City. If such a preference is implemented, Homeless \n5  Persons shall only be subject to reasonable requirements to demonstrate residency.  Homeless \n6  Persons cannot be denied admission to the Housing Site on the basis that Pallet Shelters are \n7  reserved for other Homeless Persons who have been or will be subject to Enforcement efforts by \n8  the City or referrals by the City or third parties with one exception. That exception is that the \n9  City may reserve, or cause to be reserved, the number of Pallet Shelters needed to provide \n10  shelter to the number of Homeless Persons identified in any notice served on Plaintiffsโ Counsel \n11  pursuant to Paragraph 10(c) and/or (d) of this Agreement until such Enforcement has concluded.    \n12  b.  The Housing Site shall be Low-Barrier, which means the admissions and eligibility \n13 \npolicies will prioritize admitting people directly from living outside and shall not include \n14 \nadmission barriers such as: sobriety requirements, drug testing, credit checks, and/or \n15 \nidentification requirements. Criminal background checks shall only be performed and \n16 \nconsidered for the purpose of admission to the Housing Site when required by law.  \n17 \n18  c.  The Housing Site shall be open 24 hours per day, seven days per week and occupants \n19 \nmay remain at the Housing Site at all times.  \n20 \nd.  The Housing Site shall not have a limit on the amount of time an occupant may stay at \n21 \nthe site. \n22 \ne.  The Housing Site rules as to expulsion from the site shall only apply to occupantsโ \n23 \n24  behavior within the site, such as behavior that puts the health and safety of staff and occupants \n25  at risk. \n26 \nf.  Occupants shall not be required to participate in any programs or services as a \n27 \ncondition of admission or remaining at the Housing Site. The City and/or the Housing Site \n28 \noperator may provide voluntary programs on site.  \n \n9 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  g.  Sobriety shall not be required for occupant admission and to remain at the Housing \n2 \nSite. \n3 \nh.  On-site possession and/or use of controlled substances that are illegal under California \n4 \nlaw may be prohibited. \n5 \ni.  Anyone who is denied admission to reside in the Housing Site shall receive a written \n6 \n7  notice stating the reason for denial and the grievance procedure for challenging the denial.  \n8  j.  When the City or Housing Site operator believes there is grounds to expel an occupant, \n9 \nthe City and/or Housing Site operator must provide, or cause to be provided written notice and \n10 \nan opportunity to cure the alleged conduct, unless the conduct is so extreme that it has put or \n11 \nlikely will put other occupants or staff at immediate physical harm and the risk cannot be \n12 \n13  reasonably mitigated. \n14  k.  The City shall ensure, or cause to be ensured, that all occupants of the Housing Site are \n15  offered voluntary case management to provide assistance with securing permanent housing, \n16  employment and income benefits, health care (both physical and mental), treatment for \n17  substance use, assistance with legal issues and transportation. \n18  7.  Notice of Opening Date for Chico Non-Congregate Emergency Housing Site. The City \n19  or any of its contractors or agents may only start admitting occupants to the Housing Site once it meets \n20  all of the requirements of Paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of this Agreement. At least 5 business days before the \n21  Housing Site opens, the City shall notify Plaintiffsโ counsel and the Butte County Continuum of Care of \n22  the opening date. The City shall also offer Plaintiffsโ Counsel the opportunity to tour the Housing Site \n23  before it opens. \n24  8.  Reservation of Pallet Shelters for Plaintiffs.  Each Plaintiff shall be offered a Pallet \n25  Shelter at the Housing Site, and the City must reserve, or cause to be reserved, eight Pallet Shelters for \n26  Plaintiffs for two months after the date the Housing Site opens. Plaintiffs may accept a Pallet Shelter \n27  and move into the Pallet Shelter upon the Housing Site opening and for two months from that date.  \n28  9.  Enforcement of Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations.  The City shall not require a \n \n10 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Homeless Person to relocate from Public Property and/or Enforce its Anti-Camping Ordinances and \n2  Regulations until the Housing Site is open and available to admit Homeless Persons. Once the Housing \n3  Site is open, the City may only require Homeless Persons to relocate from Public Property and Enforce \n4  the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  \n5  10.  Notice and Individual Assessment Prior to Enforcement of Anti-Camping Ordinances \n6  and Regulations. Any requirement that a Homeless Person relocate themselves or their personal \n7  property from Public Property and/or Enforcement of the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations \n8  against a Homeless Person will be preceded by notice to Plaintiffsโ counsel, contacts with Outreach and \n9  Engagement Staff, and an Individual Assessment as follows: \n10  a.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties or pursuant to a decision as part of the dispute \n11  resolution procedure outlined in Paragraph 16 of this Agreement, the Torres Community Shelter \n12  (Torres Shelter) and the Housing Site are the only shelter locations that can be counted to \n13  determine if there are sufficient shelter beds for the City to begin Enforcement in accordance \n14  with the terms of this Agreement. The Torres Shelter is a congregate shelter located at 101 \n15  Silver Dollar Way, Chico, CA 95928. The Partiesโ understanding of the Torres Shelter as of the \n16  time of signing this agreement is as follows: The Torres Shelter is a year-round congregate \n17  shelter that allows occupants to remain at the site 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The Torres \n18  Shelter is available to men and women who are homeless, does not require participation in a \n19  religious or other program as a prerequisite to admission or to remain at the shelter, and allows \n20  one service or companion animal per person. The Torres Shelter provides three meals a day, and \n21  shower and laundry facilities to occupants. Occupants sleep in bunk beds in a dormitory. There \n22  is one dormitory for women and one for men. The Torres Shelter also provides sleeping \n23  accommodations on mats.   \n24  b.  The City must count, or cause to be counted, the number of Homeless Persons staying \n25  on the designated Public Property it wishes to relocate Homeless Persons from and/or Enforce \n26  the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations, and confirm that, prior to the actions below, \n27  there are at least the same number of Pallet Shelters available at the Housing Site and/or beds \n28  available at the Torres Shelter.  The City may not count spaces on a mat at the Torres Shelter as \n \n11 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  available. The City may only count, or cause to be counted, one available bed per unoccupied \n2  Pallet Shelter at the Housing Site.  However, whenever the number of Homeless Persons at the \n3  designated Public Property subject to relocation and/or Enforcement exceeds the number of \n4  unoccupied Pallet Shelters, the City may count an unoccupied bed in a Pallet Shelter provided \n5  that the City has a reasonable basis to believe that Homeless Person(s) in question would \n6  voluntarily agree to reside together in the particular Pallet Shelter. The City may not require a \n7  Homeless Person to share a Pallet Shelter with another Homeless Person. Plaintiffs reserve the \n8  right to dispute that there is enough shelter to begin relocation and/or Enforcement, including \n9  when the City counts beds in occupied Pallet Shelters. \n10  c.  Upon conducting the count of Homeless Persons and confirming there are sufficient \n11  open Pallet Shelters at the Housing Site and beds at the Torres Shelter to accommodate all of the \n12  Homeless Persons on the designated Public Property, the City shall provide written notice to \n13  Plaintiffsโ counsel at least 7 days prior to issuing the notices required to Homeless Persons in \n14  Paragraph 10(f) of this Agreement. The notice to Plaintiffsโ Counsel shall state: 1) the exact \n15  location of Public Property of the planned Enforcement; 2) the number of Homeless Persons the \n16  City determined are currently residing at that location; 3) the date the City plans to provide the \n17  notices required in Paragraph 10(f); 3) the number of open Pallet Shelters at the Housing Site \n18  and the number of open shelter beds at the Torres Shelter by gender (if the Pallet Shelters and/or \n19  beds are restricted to a particular gender and the Torres Shelter is able to provide such \n20  information with respect to its beds); and 4) the name, phone number, and email of a contact at \n21  both shelter sites that Plaintiffsโ counsel can contact to verify the shelter information.  Plaintiffsโ \n22  counsel shall keep this notice and its contents confidential, but are not precluded from \n23  investigating the information in the notice.  If Plaintiffsโ counsel dispute within 7 days of \n24  receiving the notice that there are sufficient open Pallet Shelters and beds for the City to begin \n25  the planned Enforcement, Plaintiffsโ counsel shall initiate the dispute resolution process in \n26  Paragraph 16 of this Agreement. The City must stay Enforcement at the designated location \n27  until the dispute resolution process concludes. \n28  d.  When the City serves a notice on Plaintiffsโ Counsel pursuant to Paragraph 10(c) of this \n \n12 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Agreement, and the notice designates a Public Property with 5 or fewer Homeless Persons, the \n2  City may serve the notice three business days prior to issuing the notices required to Homeless \n3  Persons in Paragraph 10(f) of this Agreement.  \n4  e.  The City may only serve Plaintiffsโ Counsel one notice pursuant to Paragraphs 10 (c) \n5  and/or (d) of this Agreement at a time, and cannot serve a subsequent notice until all of the time \n6  periods for all notices required by Paragraph 10 of this Agreement have expired.  The City may \n7  include up to three Public Properties within a single notice so long as the total number of \n8  Homeless Persons at multiple locations does not exceed fifty (50).  If a single Public Property is \n9  identified in a notice, there shall be no limit on the number of Homeless Persons who may be \n10  subject to relocation.   \n11  f.  The City must then provide, or cause to be provided, a notice to all Homeless Persons \n12  staying on the designated Public Property the City wishes to close and/or Enforce its Anti-\n13  Camping Ordinances and Regulations at least 7 days before the City issues, or causes to be \n14  issued, a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification or takes any other action to Enforce its Anti-\n15  Camping Ordinances and Regulations.  This notice must explain the Individual Assessment \n16  process.  The notice shall state the Homeless Persons may contact Legal Service of Northern \n17  California at 530-345-9491, chico-office@lsnc.net, or 541 Normal Ave, Chico, California \n18  95928 for information about their legal rights during this process.   \n19  g.  The O&E Staff must meet with all Homeless Persons at the Public Property noticed for \n20  Enforcement to conduct an Individual Assessment and provide written notice to the Homeless \nPerson of the outcome of the Individual Assessment. The Individual Assessment must occur when \n21 \nor after notice required in Paragraph 10(f) is issued, and at least prior to the date the City issues, \n22 \nor causes to be issued, a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification or takes any other action to \n23 \nEnforce its Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations as to that person. O&E Staff may provide \n24 \nHomeless Persons information about, and referrals to, any permanent, transitional, and emergency \n25 \nhousing space available, and make voluntary referrals to such housing. However, if the Homeless \n26 \nPerson declines any of the above, the O&E must assess whether an open Pallet Shelter at the \n27  Housing Site or bed at the Torres Shelter is an Appropriate Shelter Space, as defined in Paragraph \n28  10(h) of this Agreement, for the individual.  \n \n13 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  h.  A  Pallet  Shelter  at  the  Housing Site  and/or  a bed  at  the  Torres  Shelter  is  not  an \n2  โAppropriate Shelter Spaceโ for an individual when:  \ni.  The shelter cannot accommodate the personโs physical and/or mental disabilities;  \n3 \nii.  The shelterโs hours and/or other policies unreasonably impair or otherwise unreasonably \n4 \nhinder a personโs ability to work, engage in other income generating activities, and/or attend \n5 \nschool; \n6 \niii. In the case of a family unit, the family would have to be involuntarily separated into two \n7 \nor  more  different  rooms  or  units,  but  a  family  unit  may  voluntarily  accept  such  an \n8 \narrangement;  \n9  iv. The  individual  would  be  disqualified  from  accessing  the  shelter  space  due  to  any \n10  restrictions, rules or covenants beyond their reasonable use or control, such as having a pet \nthat the shelter does not allow;  \n11 \nv.  The shelter space requires mandatory participation in a religious or other program as a \n12 \nprerequisite to access or use the shelter space; \n13 \nvi. The shelter space only offers a mat, and not a bed for sleeping; or  \n14 \nvii. The shelter space cannot provide the appropriate single-gender placement for someone \n15 \nwho reasonably objects to mixed-gender placement. \n16 \ni.  The following procedures apply to Individual Assessments: \n17  i.  It shall be conducted at the then-current location of the Homeless Person, or any other \n18  location convenient for the Homeless Person. \n19  ii.  Chico Police Department or other law enforcement may be present at the general location \nwhere O&E Staff are meeting with Homeless Persons but they must remain far enough away \n20 \nfrom O&E Staff and Homeless Persons to ensure that the Individual Assessment remains \n21 \nprivate and outside the immediate presence of law enforcement unless O&E staff requests law \n22 \nenforcementโs presence due to safety concerns or law enforcement determines that they need \n23 \nto intervene for safety reasons. \n24 \niii. O&E  Staff  must  meet  with  the  Homeless  Person  more  than  once  to  complete  the \n25  Individual Assessment, if necessary.  \n26  iv. The Homeless Person may have one advocate or representative attend the Individual \n27  Assessment.  \nv.  O&E Staff must document all attempts to meet with a Homeless Person during the 7-day \n28 \nO&E process.  If O&E Staff documents that it was at the Homeless Personโs location at least \n \n14 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  five days during the 7-day O&E period and made a good faith attempt each day to conduct an \n2  Individual Assessment of that person, O&E Staff does not need to make any further attempts \nto conduct an Individual Assessment for that person. O&E Staff must leave a notice on the \n3 \nHomeless Personโs property or in the area the person is known to stay that 1) it attempted to \n4 \ncontact the Homeless Person, 2) provides the dates and times of the attempted contacts, 3) \n5 \ninforms that Homeless Person they can still get an Individual Assessment by contacting O&E \n6 \nStaff, and 4) provides how to contact O&E Staff.  \n7 \nj.  If O&E Staff determines there is an Appropriate Shelter Space at Torres Shelter or the \n8 \nHousing Site for the Homeless Person, O&E Staff will provide the homeless person written notice \n9  of the Appropriate Shelter Space.  \n10  k.  If the Homeless Person accepts the Appropriate Shelter Space at the Torres Shelter or \nHousing Site, the O&E Staff will provide or arrange for transportation to the placement, if needed.  \n11 \nl.  If the Homeless Person declines the Appropriate Shelter Space offered, the City may issue \n12 \na 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification upon the expiration of the 7-day notice required in \n13 \nParagraph 10 (f). If the individual relocates within the 72 hours, then they will not be cited or \n14 \narrested for violating the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations.  If the individual fails to \n15 \nrelocate, then the individual may be issued a citation or, subject to this Agreement, placed under \n16 \ncustodial arrest for the violation. \n17  m.  If the O&E Staff determine through the Individual Assessment that there is not an \n18  Appropriate Shelter Space for a Homeless Person, the City may not Enforce its Anti-Camping \n19  Ordinances and Regulations against the Homeless Person. The City may provide, or cause to be \n20  provided, to the Homeless Person a list of at least three Public Property locations where the City \n21  will not Enforce its Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations for at least 60 days and may \n22  require the Homeless Person to relocate to one of those three sites. When the City provides the \n23  Homeless Person with the list of Public Property locations, the notice must also state the person \n24  may contact Legal Services of Northern California at 530-345-9491, chico-office@lsnc.net, or \n25  541 Normal Ave, Chico, California 95928 for information about their legal rights during this \n26  process.  The three sites must be within a half mile of public transportation and food services. \n27  The City must provide or arrange, or cause to be provided or arranged, for transportation to the \n28  new site for the Homeless Person and their personal belongings, if requested by the Homeless \n \n15 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Person. The City may only require a Homeless Person who O&E Staff has determined there is \n2  not an Appropriate Shelter Space at Torres and/or the Housing Site to relocate under this \n3  process two times during a 12-month period.   \n4  n.  The City must keep, or cause to be kept, all notices issued under this process and, only \n5  upon request by a Homeless Person, must provide, or cause to be provided, information about the \nIndividual Assessment to the Homeless Person or any representative of the Homeless Person with \n6 \nthe Homeless Personโs permission. \n7 \no.  The Parties shall meet and confer and try to reach  agreement on the language of all notices \n8 \nrequired in Paragraph 10 of this Agreement within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement \n9 \nand at least fourteen (14) days before the Housing site opens, whichever is earlier. If the Parties \n10 \nare unable to reach agreement, they shall submit the dispute for resolution to the dispute resolution \n11 \nprocess outlined in Paragraph 16 of this Agreement.  \n12  11.

Except as specified below in Paragraphs 11(c) and (d), Defendants shall not seize any \n19  personal property that is attended, unattended, or believed to be abandoned on public \n20  property in violation of applicable City ordinance(s) without first providing a written pre-\n21  removal notice at least 72 hours in advance of the seizure that is posted prominently at the \n22  location of the personal property, and if possible, provided to the apparent owner of the \n23  personal property.  \n24  A.  The pre-removal notice shall provide: \n25  1)  A general description of the personal property to be removed;  \n26  2)  A description of the geographic location or area that is sufficient for a \n27  reasonable person to understand the location or area within which personal property \n28  will be subject to removal;  \n \n16 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  3)  The date and time the notice was posted;  \n2  4)  A statement that the personal property has been stored on public property in \n3  violation of the applicable City ordinance(s) with citations to those ordinances; \n4  5)  A statement that the personal property may be relocated or stored if not \n5  removed from public property within 72 hours;  \n6  6)  The address where removed personal property will be stored; \n7  7)  A telephone number through which a person may receive information as to \n8  stored personal property; \n9  8)  The daily schedule when a person may retrieve their personal property; \n10  9)  A statement that stored personal property may be destroyed if not claimed \n11  within ninety (90) calendar days after storage; and \n12  10)  A statement that property determined to be an imminent threat to health and \n13  safety may be destroyed. \n14 \niii.

Personal property obstructing any operational and useable entrance, exit, \n \n18 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  driveway, or loading dock. \n2  ii.  When Defendants relocate personal property without prior written notice in the \n3  circumstances described above, they shall prominently post and date a โPersonal Property \n4  Relocation Noticeโ either at the exact location from which the personal property was \n5  relocated or as close as possible to that location and prominently post a copy of that notice at \n6  the new location of the personal property.

For personal property relocated due to construction, maintenance, repair, or \n16  landscaping operations, the notice shall include a phone number that the personal \n17  property owner may call for assistance from Defendants in returning their personal \n18  property to its original location.  \n19  d.  ITEMS NOT SUBJECT TO RELOCATION, SEIZURE, AND STORAGE \n20  PROCEDURES \n21  i.  Personal property may be seized and/or destroyed without being subject to the above \n22  relocation, removal, and storage procedures under any of the following circumstances: \n23  A.  The property presents a health or safety risk, such as toxic sharps, chemicals, and \n24  bedding or clothing that is soiled by infectious materials, human waste, body fluids, \n25  mold or mildew; \n26  B.  The property is infested by rodents or insects;  \n27  C.  The property is evidence of a crime, or is contraband; or \n28  D.  The property owner confirms in writing that they are abandoning the property. \n \n19 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  ii.

Public Sanitary Facilities. The City shall not close or fence off any public bathrooms, \n7  toilets, and sinks located on Public Property so as to make such public facilities unavailable to \n8  Homeless Persons, except that such facilities may be closed temporarily for maintenance or repairs. \n9  Such closure shall only be for the time needed for the applicable maintenance or repairs. If such \n10  facilities are closed due to damage and the cost of repair is too costly for the City to repair and reopen, \n11  the City may provide mobile toilets and handwashing stations in lieu of making such repairs in the \n12  same quantity as the closed facilities and in the same general location.   The City shall not cause water \n13  to be cut off to any water fountain located on Public Property, or restrict access to such water fountains \n14  so as to make them unavailable to Homeless Persons, unless and only for the time required for \n15  maintenance and repairs.  It is the Partiesโ understanding that the City has not closed public sanitary \n16  facilities for the purpose of making the same unavailable to Homeless Persons, but rather to repair and \n17  maintain damaged public sanitary facilities.  The intent of this provision is simply to balance Homeless \n18  Personsโ interest in keeping public sanitary facilities open against the Cityโs interest in reducing the \n19  costs required to maintain and repair the same.  \n20  13.  Dismissals of Citations and Charges related to Homelessness against Plaintiffs. Within \n21  30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the City shall file a request for dismissal and/or take \n22  any other appropriate action to dismiss all administrative and criminal citations, charges, and cases \n23  against Plaintiffs that relate to Plaintiffsโ status as a homeless individual.

Carol Beth Thompson (Case Nos. 18CI05620 and 17TR10367, and citation (AKA Chico \n6  Police Department Notice to Appear) number 300659 issued on December 28, 2021).  \n7  e.  If Plaintiffs discover any additional administrative and/or criminal citations, charges, \n8  and cases that should be dismissed pursuant to this Paragraph, Plaintiffsโ Counsel shall notify \n9  the City of the additional cases and request dismissal. The Cityโs failure to dismiss any \n10  administrative and/or criminal citations, charges, and cases relating to Plaintiffsโ status as a \n11  homeless person that are not specifically identified here or subsequently identified shall not \n12  constitute a breach of this Agreement.  \n13  14.  Damages. The City shall pay Plaintiffs a total of $12,000, comprising payment for \n14  Plaintiffsโ claims for damages.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the City shall \n15  deliver, or cause to be delivered, a check for $12,000 payable to Legal Services of Northern California, \n16  at Legal Services of Northern California, 541 Normal Avenue, Chico, CA 95928. \n17  15.  Attorneysโ Fees and Costs. The City shall pay Plaintiffsโ counsel a total of $650,000, \n18  comprising payment for Plaintiffsโ claims for attorneysโ fees and costs.  Within 30 days of the Effective \n19  Date of this Agreement, the City shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, a check for $650,000 payable to \n20  Legal Services of Northern California, at Legal Services of Northern California, 541 Normal Avenue, \n21  Chico, CA 95928.  This payment of $650,000 does not apply to any additional fees and costs that might \n22  be subsequently awarded to Plaintiffsโ counsel pursuant to Paragraph 16(g) below.  \n23  16.  Dispute Resolution.  Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman (โJudge Newmanโ) will retain \n24  jurisdiction over the Action until five years from the Effective Date for purposes of overseeing \n25  implementation, enforcement and/or modification of this Agreement through the dispute resolution \n26  process described below. Plaintiffsโ counsel may present disputes in the dispute resolution process \n27  which not only affect Plaintiffs but any other aggrieved Homeless Person in the City.  The dispute \n28  resolution process does not apply to any dispute between Plaintiffs and other Homeless Persons, on the \n \n21 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  one hand, and the City, on the other hand, other than alleged violations of the Anti-Camping \n2  Ordinances and Regulations and this Agreement. \n3  a.  Should a dispute arise over the implementation, enforcement or modification of the \n4  Agreement, the Parties will first attempt to meet and confer informally with the other side to \n5  resolve the matter in good faith.  Such attempt will at least involve (a) a communication from \n6  the party initiating the dispute to the other sideโs counsel describing in detail the dispute and the \n7  requested remedy and providing any available evidence in relation thereto; and (b) a discussion \n8  either in person or by telephone seeking to resolve the dispute. \n9  b.  If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute, then within five court days after \n10  completing the meet and confer process outlined above, the Party initiating the dispute shall \n11  request an informal conference before Judge Newman to resolve the matter by contacting Judge \n12  Newmanโs Courtroom Deputy via e-mail. \n13  c.  If the informal conference before Judge Newman does not resolve the dispute, then the \n14  Party initiating the dispute may thereafter file a motion to implement, enforce or modify the \n15  Agreement in accordance with the standards and processes to be set by Judge Newman, and \n16  Judge Newman will have jurisdiction to resolve that dispute.  If the Dispute involves an \n17  emergency situation that presents a threat to the immediate health and safety of an individual, \n18  the parties may seek expedited review by Judge Newman.  \n19  d.  The initiation of the dispute resolution process does not affect the Cityโs right to enforce \n20  any laws other than the Anti-Camping Ordinances and Regulations. If a pending dispute \n21  brought by Plaintiffsโ Counsel involves Plaintiff(s) or other Homeless Person(s), the City agrees \n22  that no citation or custodial arrest will subsequently be made for violating an Anti-Camping \n23  Ordinance or Regulation arising from an individualโs status as a Homeless Person until the \n24  dispute resolution process is concluded.  Once the dispute resolution process is concluded \n25  regarding an issue, the City is not required to engage in a subsequent dispute resolution process \n26  regarding the same issue. \n27  e.  In resolving any dispute, Judge Newman may enforce any rights available to a Party \n28  under this Agreement, subject to sufficient notice, opportunity to be heard, briefing, evidence, \n \n22 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  and other due process.  Judge Newman may award damages (other than punitive damages), \n2  other monetary relief, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other relief, if appropriate, to \n3  any Party or Homeless Person as a result of any dispute submitted to the dispute resolution \n4  process.  Judge Newman shall make the final determination on any motion and no right of \n5  appeal shall exist. \n6  f.  Nothing in this Agreement limits the ability of Plaintiffs or other Homeless Persons to \n7  seek damages and/or other monetary relief, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other type \n8  of relief in other proceedings not subject to this Agreement.   \n9  g.  Judge Newman will have discretion to award reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs \n10  against Defendants if Plaintiffsโ counsel prevail on any dispute, whether it was resolved by \n11  motion or through the informal conference with Judge Newman.  Judge Newman may issue \n12  sanctions if a determination is made that Plaintiffsโ counsel, Defendantsโ counsel, or Defendants \n13  have not acted in good faith or with substantial justification in bringing or opposing any dispute \n14  subject to the dispute resolution process.    \n15  h.  If Judge Newman becomes unavailable to resolve disputes during the Courtโs five-year \n16  jurisdiction period, Judge Newman will designate another judge with the Partiesโ consent to \n17  serve in his place. In the event of Judge Newmanโs replacement, either Plaintiffs or Defendants \n18  may determine that they will not agree that the designated judge shall make the final \n19  determination on any motions brought to implement, enforce, or modify the Agreement without \n20  a right of appeal and Paragraph 16(e) shall be modified accordingly. \n21  17.  No Guarantee.  Nothing in this Agreement constitutes a promise, representation, or \n22  warranty by City that any number of beds will be available to any particular Homeless Person at any \n23  time. \n24  18.  Release and Covenant Not to Sue by Plaintiffs.  In consideration for the terms of this \n25  Agreement, Plaintiffs Bobby Warren, Andy Lambach, Jonathon Williams, Michael Samuelson, Tracy \n26  Miller, Tona Petersen, Carol Beth Thompson, Christa Stevens, and each of them, on their own behalf, \n27  (the โReleasing Plaintiffsโ), hereby release and forever discharge the City, City of Chico Police \n28  Department, as well as their present and former employees, agents, managers, officers, directors, \n \n23 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  council members, insurance companies, attorneys, departments, and divisions or affiliated entities, \n2  whether previously or hereafter affiliated in any manner (the โReleased City Partiesโ), from and against \n3  any and all claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages, attorneysโ fees and costs, and \n4  liabilities, arising from or relating to the events detailed in the lawsuit of any nature whatsoever, \n5  whether or not now known, suspected, or claimed, which the Releasing Plaintiffs, and/or any of them, \n6  have, or ever may claim to have, as against the Released City Parties, or any of them, whether directly \n7  or indirectly, relating to or arising out of (a) the Action, (b) any claims raised in, or that could have \n8  been raised in, the Action, (c) the availability of the Housing Site, Pallet Shelters, beds, and/or other \n9  homeless accommodations, (d) the Cityโs alleged obligation to provide and/or fund such \n10  accommodations, and/or (e) the Cityโs alleged inability to Enforce any of the Anti-Camping Ordinances \n11  and Regulations (including, without limitation, to any law that the Releasing Plaintiffs claim \n12  criminalizes a personโs homeless status), against any person because of his or her homeless status (the \n13  โReleased Plaintiff Claimsโ). \n14  a.  The release set forth above is a release of ALL claims, demands, causes of action, \n15  obligations, damages, and liabilities, of any nature whatsoever, and is intended to encompass all \n16  known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, claims that are possessed by the Releasing \n17  Plaintiffs and within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims based solely and only on the \n18  events giving rise to this Action.  To effectuate the intent of the Parties, the Releasing Plaintiffs \n19  expressly agree to waive and relinquish all rights and benefits they may have under California \n20  Civil Code section 1542, which reads as follows: \n21  SECTION 1542.  A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS \n22  THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR \n23  SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING \n24  THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE \n25  MATERIALLY  AFFECTED  HIS  OR  HER  SETTLEMENT  WITH  THE \n26  DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. \n27  b.  The Releasing Plaintiffs, and each of them, warrant that they have made no assignment, \n28  and will make no assignment, of any claim, chose in action, right of action, or any right, of any \n \n24 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  kind whatsoever, within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims, and that, as far as they \n2  know, no other person or entity of any kind had or has any interest in any of the demands, \n3  obligations, actions, causes of action, debts, liabilities, rights, contracts, damages, attorneysโ \n4  fees, costs, expenses, losses, or claims within the scope of the Released Plaintiff Claims. \n5  19.  Release and Covenant Not to Sue by Defendants.  In consideration for the terms of this \n6  Agreement, Defendants City, City of Chico Police Department, and each of them, on their own behalf, \n7  (the โReleasing Defendantsโ), hereby release and forever discharge Plaintiffs Bobby Warren, Andy \n8  Lambach, Jonathon Williams, Michael Samuelson, Tracy Miller, Tona Petersen, Carol Beth Thompson \n9  and Christa Stevens, their respective heirs, family members, executors, administrators, successors, \n10  attorneys, agents, representatives, insurance companies and assigns, whether previously or hereafter \n11  affiliated in any manner (the โReleased Plaintiffsโ), from and against any and all claims, demands, \n12  causes of action, obligations, damages, attorneysโ fees and costs, and liabilities, arising from or relating \n13  to the events detailed in the lawsuit of any nature whatsoever, whether or not now known, suspected, or \n14  claimed, which the Releasing Defendants, and/or any of them, have, or ever may claim to have, as \n15  against the Released Plaintiffs, or any of them, whether directly or indirectly, relating to or arising out \n16  of (a) the Action, (b) any claims raised in, or that could have been raised in, the Action, and (c) the \n17  availability of the Housing Site, Pallet Shelters, beds, and/or other homeless accommodations, and (d) \n18  any prior administrative or criminal citations for violations of C.M.C. ยงยง 9.20.030, 9.20.050, 9.44.015, \n19  9.44.018, 9.44.010, 9.43.030, 9.50.030 (B)-(E), 12.18.430, 12.18.450, 12R.04.340, and/or 12R.04.370, \n20  including:  Butte County Superior Court Case numbers 20CI02971, 19CI06356, 18TR04448, \n21  19CI00183, 18CI06895, 18CI03014, 19CI06426, 19CI06410, 18TR02787, 19CI06360, 18TR02923, \n22  NT239654, NT238935, NT238269, NT237637, NT230336, 18CI05620, and 17TR10367 (the \n23  โReleased Defendant Claimsโ). \n24  a.  The release set forth above is a release of ALL claims, demands, causes of action, \n25  obligations, damages, and liabilities, of any nature whatsoever, and is intended to encompass all \n26  known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, claims that are possessed by the Releasing \n27  Defendants and within the scope of the Released Defendant Claims based solely and only on the \n28  events giving rise to this Action.  To effectuate the intent of the Parties, the Releasing \n \n25 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  Defendants expressly agree to waive and relinquish all rights and benefits they may have under \n2  California Civil Code section 1542, which reads as follows: \n3  SECTION 1542.  A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS \n4  THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR \n5  SUSPECT  TO  EXIST  IN  HIS  OR  HER  FAVOR  AT  THE  TIME  OF \n6  EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, \n7  WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT \n8  WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. \n9  b.  The Releasing Defendants, and each of them, warrant that they have made no \n10  assignment, and will make no assignment, of any claim, chose in action, right of action, or any \n11  right, of any kind whatsoever, within the scope of the Released Defendant Claims, and that, as \n12  far as they know, no other person or entity had or has any interest in any of the demands, \n13  obligations, actions, causes of action, debts, liabilities, rights, contracts, damages, attorneysโ \n14  fees, costs, expenses, losses, or claims within the scope of the Released Defendant Claims.  \n15  However, the foregoing warranty does not apply to the following cases which have already been \n16  referred out to Butte County Central Collections:  Butte County Superior Court Case numbers \n17  20CI02971, 19CI06356, 18TR04448, 19CI00183, 18CI06895, 18CI03014, 19CI06426, \n18  19CI06410, 18TR02787, 19CI06360, 18TR02923, NT239654, NT238935, NT238269, \n19  NT237637, NT230336, 18CI05620, and 17TR10367.

Non-Admission of Liability.  By entering into this Agreement, the City admits no liability, \n25  and explicitly denies any liability or wrongdoing of any kind arising out of or relating to any of the \n26  claims alleged in the Action.  Nothing herein constitutes an admission by the City as to any \n27  interpretation of laws, or as to the merits, validity, or accuracy of any of the claims or legal contentions \n28  made in the Action.  The City entered into this Agreement solely to avoid the time, expense, and risk of \n \n26 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  continued litigation.  The Parties agree that an express condition of this settlement is that there has been \n2  no finding of liability on the merits, and that this settlement and any document related to this \n3  settlement, including this Agreement and the Order, and the negotiations leading up to this settlement, \n4  are inadmissible in evidence and cannot be used for any purpose in this or any other proceeding except \n5  in an action or proceeding to approve, interpret, or enforce the Agreement. \n6  22.  Knowing and Voluntary.  This Agreement is an important legal document and, in all \n7  respects, has been voluntarily and knowingly executed by the Parties.  The Parties, and each of them, \n8  specifically represent that, before signing, and within the time to consider whether to accept this \n9  Agreement, they have each carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions of this Agreement, \n10  and they are voluntarily, knowingly, and without coercion entering into this Agreement based upon \n11  their own judgment.  Plaintiffs, and each of them, further specifically represent that, before signing this \n12  Agreement, they have conferred with counsel of their choice to the extent desired concerning the legal \n13  effect of this Agreement, and that the legal effect of this Agreement has been adequately explained to \n14  them. \n15  23.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement Constitutes the entire agreement between Plaintiffs \n16  and the City regarding the matters discussed herein and supersedes any and all other agreements, \n17  understandings, negotiations, or discussions, either oral or in writing, express or implied, between \n18  Plaintiffs and the City relating to the subject matter hereof.  Plaintiffs and the City each acknowledge \n19  that no representations, inducements, promises, agreements, or warranties, oral or otherwise, have been \n20  made by them, or anyone acting on their behalf, which are not embodied in this Agreement, that they \n21  have not executed this Agreement in reliance on any such representation, inducement, promise, \n22  agreement, or warranty, and that no representation, inducement, promise, agreement, or warranty not \n23  contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any purported supplements, modifications, \n24  waivers, or terminations of this Agreement, are valid or binding, unless executed in writing by all of the \n25  Parties to this Agreement.  Any alteration, change, or modification of or to this Agreement must be \n26  made by written instrument executed by each of the Parties in order to become effective. \n27  24.  Warranty of Authority.  Each individual or entity that executes this Agreement represents \n28  and warrants, in his, her, or its personal capacity, that he, she, or it is duly authorized and empowered to \n \n27 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n\n \n1  enter into this Agreement on behalf of the party it purports to represent. \n2  25.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which is \n3  considered an original but all of which constitute one agreement. \n4  26.  Notices. Any notice required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered \n5  by electronic mail. Notices are effective when received.

ECF 1. On April 11, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a First \n5  Amended Complaint alleging that Defendants unlawfully enforced a citywide web of local laws \n6  that imposed criminal penalties on people experiencing unsheltered homelessness when they \n7  sleep, sit, lie down, and rest in public in violation of, among other things, the Fourth, Eighth, and \n8  Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and California civil rights laws. ECF \n9  34. Defendants have denied all material allegations in the First Amended Complaint. ECF 86. \n10  On April 11, 2021, this Court granted the Temporary Restraining Order restraining and \n11  enjoining Defendants from enforcing or threatening to enforce laws regulating camping, entering \n12  and remaining, and storing personal property on public property. ECF 37. On July 8, 2021, this \n13  Court entered a Preliminary Injunction against Defendants continuing the same terms previously \n14  set forth in the Temporary Restraining Order. ECF 110. \n15  Following extensive discussions, the Parties subsequently reached a settlement resolving \n16  the disputed claims in this Action. A copy of the fully executed Settlement Agreement \n17  (โSettlement Agreementโ) is attached hereto as Exhibit A, the terms of which are expressly \n18  incorporated herein by reference. \n19  The Court hereby expressly retains jurisdiction to resolve any future disputes regarding \n20  the interpretation, performance, or enforcement of the Settlement Agreement for a period of five \n21  (5) years from the date of dismissal.

ORDER GRANTING LEAVE TO FILE SUR-\nREPLY TO THE PENDING MOTION FOR \n13  CITY OF CHICO, et al.,  RELIEF FROM FINAL JUDGMENT \n14  Defendants.  (Doc. No. 220) \n15   \n16    This matter is before the court on plaintiffsโ motion to file a sur-reply in support of \n17  plaintiffsโ opposition to defendantsโ pending motion for relief from final judgment.  (Doc. No. \n18  220.)  For the reasons explained below, the court will grant plaintiffsโ motion to file a sur-reply. \n19    On January 14, 2022, this action was dismissed with prejudice by the previously assigned \n20  district judge pursuant to the partiesโ settlement agreement.  (Doc. No. 153.)  The court retained \n21  exclusive jurisdiction for a period of five years to enforce that settlement agreement and referred \n22  the matter to then-Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman1 to resolve any future disputes pursuant \n23  to the dispute resolution procedures outlined in the settlement agreement.  (Doc. No. 153 at 4.)  \n24  On August 31, 2024, defendants filed a motion for relief from final judgment seeking โlimited \n25  relief that would allow all City pre-enforcement and enforcement of Anti-Camping Ordinances \n26  and Regulations in accordance with local, state, and federal laws, including the Grants Pass \n27   \n1 As a result of Magistrate Judge Newmanโs retirement, Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn K. \n28  Delaney was reassigned as the settlement judge in this action.  (Doc. No. 201.)  \n  1   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-DAD-DMC   Document 223   Filed 11/15/24   Page 2 of 3\n1  decision.โ  (Doc. No. 209 at 13.)2  In their opposition, plaintiffs argue that by filing a motion for \n2  relief from final judgment, defendants are attempting to improperly bypass the dispute resolution \n3  process outlined in the settlement agreement, which requires the parties to meet and confer \n4  informally and then attend a conference with a magistrate judge before filing a motion to modify \n5  the settlement.  (Doc. No. 216 at 11โ12.)  In their reply, defendants stated that they โrespectfully \n6  request[] that this [c]ourt provide relief from, inter alia, the dispute resolution procedures . . . .โ  \n7  (Doc. No. 218 at 17.)  Plaintiffs subsequently filed the pending motion for leave to file a sur-reply \n8  to address defendantsโ request for relief from the dispute resolution process.  (Doc. No. 220 at 2.) \n9    Parties do not have a general right to file sur-reply briefs.  See L.R. 230.  However, \n10  โnothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prevents the court from granting a party leave to \n11  file a sur-reply.โ  McGechie v. Atomos Ltd., No. 2:22-cv-01812-DJC-DB, 2023 WL 2918681 at \n12  *1 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 12, 2023).  โA decision to grant or deny leave to file a sur-reply is generally \n13  committed to the sound discretion of the court.โ  Tounget v. Valley-Wide Recreation & Park \n14  Dist., No. 16-cv-00088-JGB-KK, 2020 WL 8410456 at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 20, 2020) (internal \n15  quotation and citation omitted).  โAlthough the [c]ourt may in its discretion permit the filing of a \n16  sur[-]reply, this discretion should be exercised in favor of allowing a sur[-]reply only where a \n17  valid reason for such additional briefing exists, such as where the movant raises new arguments in \n18  its reply brief.โ  Fedrick v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1190, 1197 (N.D. Ga. \n19  2005).   \n20    In their motion for leave to file a sur-reply, plaintiffs contend that defendantsโ request for \n21  relief from the dispute resolution process as set forth in their reply brief โclarif[ied] the relief \n22  soughtโ and that plaintiffs โshould have an opportunity to respondโ to that new argument.  (Doc. \n23  No. 220 at 2.)  In defendantsโ opposition to plaintiffsโ motion for leave to file a sur-reply, \n24  defendants argue that, because their original motion for relief from judgment seeks relief from \n25  โcumbersome notice and enforcement proceduresโ in the settlement agreement, this implicitly \n26 \n \n27  2  On September 6, 2024, this case was reassigned to the undersigned.  (Doc. Nos. 210, 211.)  On \nSeptember 10, 2024, defendants re-noticed their motion for relief from final judgment in front of \n28  the undersigned.  (Doc. No. 213.) \n  2   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-DAD-DMC   Document 223   Filed 11/15/24   Page 3 of 3\n1  also seeks relief from the dispute resolution process, including relief from the required processes \n2  prior to the filing of any motion for relief from final judgment.  (Doc. No. 222 at 3โ4.)  The court \n3  has reviewed defendantsโ motion for relief from judgment and observes that the โcumbersome \n4  notice and enforcement proceduresโ that defendants refer to solely regard substantive portions of \n5  the settlement agreement, such as the processes of noticing specific encampment sites to be \n6  cleared, counting the occupants, assessing willingness to enter a shelter, etc.  (Doc. No. 213 at \n7  14.)  Accordingly, the court is not persuaded that defendantsโ motion for relief from judgment \n8  sufficiently notified plaintiffs that defendants are also seeking relief from the dispute resolution \n9  process outlined in the partiesโ settlement agreement.  Thus finds that plaintiffs have stated good \n10  cause for the filing of a sur-reply.  And their motion for leave to file a sur-reply will be granted. \n11    Also in their opposition to plaintiffsโ motion for leave to file a sur-reply, defendants \n12  request that, should the court grant plaintiffsโ request, the court also grant defendants โpermission \n13  to file a reply to the sur-reply.โ  (Doc. No. 222 at 5.)  However, granting this request at this point \n14  would encourage โan endless volley of briefs.โ  Garrison v. Ne. Ga. Med. Ctr., 66 F. Supp. 2d \n15  1336, 1340 (N.D. Ga. 1999).  Therefore, the court will deny defendantsโ request to file a reply to \n16  the sur-reply without prejudice to renewal if appropriate. \n17    Accordingly, \n18    1.  Plaintiffsโ motion for leave to file a sur-reply (Doc. No. 220) is granted;  \n19  2.  The hearing on the pending motion set for November 19, 2024 in this matter is \n20  hereby vacated; and \n21  3.  Within fourteen (14) days of the date of entry of this order, plaintiffs shall file a \n22  sur-reply to defendantsโ reply in support of their motion for relief from final \n23  judgment (Doc. No. 218).  Plaintiffsโ sur-reply may only address new arguments \n24  raised for the first time in defendantsโ reply. \n \n25 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n26 \nDated:     November 14, 2024      \n27  DALE A.

Kimberly J. Mueller \nDefendants. \n21     \n22   \n23  This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffsโ ex parte motion for temporary restraining \n24  order. All Parties were given notice. Having considered the papers filed in support of Plaintiffsโ \n25  motion for a temporary restraining order, and any opposition thereto, for good cause shown, the \n26  Court hereby enters the following Order:  \n27   \n28 \n  1   \n[Proposed] Order Regarding Temporary Restraining Order (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 32   Filed 04/11/21   Page 2 of 3\n \n \n \n1  The Court finds that a temporary restraining order is warranted pursuant to Federal Rule of \n \n2  Civil Procedure 65 and Civil Local Rule 231. Plaintiffs have carried their burden of demonstrating \n3  that they are likely to succeed on the merits, that they would be irreparably harmed in the absence \n4  of a temporary restraining order, that the equities weigh in favor of granting the requested \n5  temporary restraining order, and that the temporary restraining order would not be against the \n6  public interest. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have no other adequate legal remedy to preserve \n7  the status quo.  \n8  This order is based, in part, on a finding that there are not enough available emergency \n9  shelter beds or other emergency shelter for the number of unhoused persons in Chico, California.  \n10  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ motion for a temporary restraining \n11  order is GRANTED. The Court orders as follows: \n12  1.  Defendants City of Chico and Chico Police Department, their agents, servants, employees \n13  and attorneys and those in active concert or participation with them are restrained and \n14  enjoined from the following, pending this Courtโs resolution of Plaintiffโs Motion for \n15  Preliminary Injunction: \n16  a.  Enforcing or threatening to enforce the 72-Hour Illegal Encampment \n17  Notifications dated April 8, 2021 at 12 p.m. at Comanche Creek Green \n18  Way in Chico, California;  \n19  b.  Issuing or enforcing any other 72-Hour Illegal Encampment Notifications \n20  as to unhoused persons on public property in Chico, California;  \n21  c.  Enforcing or threatening to enforce the Chico Municipal Code sections \n22  listed in the April 8, 2021 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification, which \n23  are Municipal Code sections 12R.04.340, 12.18.430,  9.20.010  through \n24  9.20.060; and 9.50.030.  Enforcement and threat of enforcement of ยง \n25  9.20.030 (Unlawful Camping) is only restrained on public property. \n26  Enforcement and threat of enforcement of ยง 9.50.030 is limited to  ยงยง \n27  9.50.030 (B) -(E) (Waterways Ordinance - Camping, Staying, Storage of \n28  Personal Property, Entering and Remaining);  \n  2   \n[Proposed] Order Regarding Temporary Restraining Order (Warren, et al v.

Enforcing or threatening to enforce California Penal Code ยง 647(c), which \n \n2  is listed on the April 8, 2021 at 12 p.m. Illegal Encampment Notification; \n3  and \n4  e.  Destroying property of unhoused persons seized by Defendants even if \n5  Defendants value the property at $100 or less and/or determine it is not of \n6  reasonable value. \n7  2.  There is no cost to Defendants and Plaintiffs are indigent, unhoused persons, so no \n8  security bond is required.  \n9  3.   Since this Temporary Restraining Order was granted on ex parte notice, Defendants may \n10  apply to the court for modification or dissolution on two days' notice or such shorter \n11  notice as the court may allow.  \n12   \n13  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n14   \n15  DATE and TIME_________  \n16        \n17   \n          ___________________________________________ \n18  Hon.

Given that Plaintiffs were challenging enforcement actions set to begin \n28  the following morning, this Court issued a TRO to preserve the status quo until full \n  1   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 2 of 7\n1  briefing could be provided and a hearing could be had on whether a longer term \n2  preliminary injunction should issue.  Essentially, the Court called a โtime-outโ prohibiting \n3  Defendants from taking any further action until it could receive briefing from both sides \n4  on the issues raised.  In keeping with the short-term nature of that TRO, the Court set a \n5  hearing on Plaintiffsโ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on April 23, 2021.  At that hearing, \n6  the parties agreed to extend the TRO so they could try to work together to reach an \n7  informal resolution of Plaintiffsโ claims.  They were not able to reach an agreement, and \n8  this case came before the Court for hearing on the pending Motion on July 2, 2021.  \n9  Having considered the record in its entirety and the applicable law, Plaintiffsโ Motion is \n10  hereby GRANTED.   \n11   \n12 \nSTANDARD \n13   \n14  โA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.โ  Munaf v. Geren, \n15  553 U.S. 674, 689 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  โ[T]he \n16  purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo between the parties \n17  pending a resolution of a case on the merits.โ  McCormack v. Hiedeman, 694 F.3d 1004, \n18  1019 (9th Cir. 2012).  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \n19  that:  (1) he is โlikely to succeed on the merits;โ (2) he is โlikely to suffer irreparable harm \n20  in the absence of preliminary relief;โ (3) โthe balance of equities tips in his favor;โ and \n21  (4) โan injunction is in the public interest.โ  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n22  20 (2008).  โWhen the government is a partyโ to a case in which a preliminary injunction \n23  is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors โmerge.โ  Drakes Bay \n24  Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014).  โGenerally, public interest \n25  concerns are implicated when a constitutional right has been violated, because all \n26  citizens have a stake in upholding the constitution.โ  Preminger v. Principi, 422 F.3d 815, \n27  826 (9th Cir. 2005).  There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of an \n28  unlawful government action.  UFW v. U.S. DOL, No. 1:20-CV-1690, 2020 WL 7646406, \n  2   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 3 of 7\n1  at *20 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2020) (citing League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, \n2  12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). \n3  Alternatively, under the so-called sliding scale approach, โ[t]he Ninth Circuit \n4  weighs [the above] factors on a sliding scale,โ so that where there are โโserious \n5  questions going to the meritsโโthat is, less than a โlikelihood of successโ on the meritsโ\n6  a preliminary injunction may still be issued so long as โthe balance of hardships tips \n7  sharply in the plaintiffโs favorโ and the other two factors are satisfied.โ  Short v. Brown, \n8  893 F.3d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, \n9  632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011)). \n10  โIn each case, courts โmust balance the competing claims of injury and must \n11  consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested \n12  relief.โโ  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. \n13  531, 542 (1987)).  A district court should enter a preliminary injunction only โupon a clear \n14  showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.โ  Id. at 22.   \n15   \n16  ANALYSIS1 \n17   \n18  The City of Chico has put into place ordinances that make it unlawful for any \n19  individual to sit, lie, stand, sleep on any public property within the City without being \n20  subject to criminal penalties.  More specifically, Chicoโs anti-camping ordinance makes it \n21  unlawful โfor any person to camp or occupy camp facilities on any public property or any \n22  private property which is not operated and maintained as a campground . . . .โ  Chico \n23  Cal., Mun. Code ยง 9.20.030 (2021) (emphasis added).  โโCampโ means to place, pitch or \n24   \n1 This Memorandum focuses on Plaintiffsโ Eighth Amendment cause of action.  It appears to the \n25 \nCourt that the property destruction challenged in the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims occurs in \nconnection with cleaning up โillegalโ encampments.  That property destruction should thus cease with the \n26 \ncriminal enforcement of the relevant ordinances.  In an abundance of caution, however, the Court makes \nclear that it finds Plaintiffs have shown they are likely to succeed on the merits of those claims, Lavan v. \n27 \nCity of Los Angeles, 693 F.3d 1022, 1030 (9th Cir. 2012), they are likely to suffer imminent irreparable \nharm absent an injunction, and that the balance of equities and public interest favor issuing an injunction \n28 \nas well.    \n  3   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 4 of 7\n1  occupy camp facilities; to live temporarily in a camp facility or outdoors.โ  Id. \n2  ยง 9.20.020(A) (emphasis added).  โViolation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor or \n3  an infraction and may be enforced by the filing of a criminal action by the city attorney or \n4  the issuance of an administrative citation . . . . .โ  Id. ยง 9.20.060.  Defendantsโ counsel \n5  conceded that โa person could never sit, sleep, lie on any property or else they would . . . \n6  be criminally prosecuted . . . unless the person walked 24 hours a day and had no \n7  personal property.โ  Transcript, Apr. 23, 2021, ECF No. 72, at 19.    \n8  Because the ordinances passed by the City Council subject individuals to criminal \n9  penalties for โliving outdoorsโ anywhere in the City, the result is that homeless individuals \n10  are subject to criminal prosecution no matter where they go within the jurisdiction.  This \n11  Circuit has previously held that ordinances such as this are not enforceable, unless there \n12  is enough practically available shelter within the City for all unhoused individuals.  \n13  Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 617 (2019) (holding โthat โso long as there is a \n14  greater number of homeless individuals in [a jurisdiction] than the number of available \n15  beds [in shelters],โ the jurisdiction cannot prosecute homeless individuals for \n16  โinvoluntarily sitting, lying, and sleeping in public.โโ) (quoting Jones v. City of Los \n17  Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 (9th Cir. 2006)).   \n18  At the first preliminary injunction hearing, Plaintiffs advised the Court there were a \n19  total of 120 shelter beds in Chico to serve an estimated homeless population of over 500 \n20  individuals.  That is insufficient under Martin if Chico wants to criminalize resting on \n21  public property.  See id.2   \n22  As indicated above, however, the Court extended the TRO after that initial hearing \n23  to allow the parties time to try to work toward a negotiated resolution.  According to the \n24  City, it then โconstructed an outdoor temporary shelter facility at the Chico Municipal  \n25  /// \n \n26 \n2 Given the great disparity between the number of beds and the number of unhoused persons, the \nCourt need not get into the weeds of whether the existing beds are โpractically available.โ  There was \n27 \nsimply not enough shelter available for the community to opt to enforce its criminal sanctions.  Plaintiffs \nare nonetheless again advised that the Court is not necessarily convinced that the reasons they offer for \n28 \ndeclining shelter render that shelter โpractically unavailableโ under Martin. \n  4   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 5 of 7\n1  Airport that accommodates all 571 of the Cityโs homeless persons.โ  Defs.โ Suppl. Br., \n2  ECF No. 90, at 3:13-14.  This raises the question, โWhat is shelter?โ \n3  According to Defendants, โ[a] shelter is a practically-available space for persons \n4  who are unhoused to go on a given day that would enable a city . . . to enforce its anti-\n5  camping, sit/lie, and so forth ordinances.โ  Transcript July 2, 2021, ECF No. 106, at 5:18-\n6  22.  That definition does not pass the straight face test.  Calling a plot of land a shelter \n7  does not make it so.3   \n8  So we turn to the dictionaries.  Merriam-Webster defines shelter as:  \n9  1:  a:  something that covers or affords protection  \n10  //a bomb shelter \n11    b:  an establishment providing food and shelter (as to \nthe homeless) \n12 \n  c:  an establishment that houses and feeds stray or \n13  unwanted animals \n14  2:   a position or the state of being covered and protected \n15  //took shelter \n16  Shelter, Mirriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shelter (last \n17  visited July 8, 2021).  In the Cambridge English dictionary, shelter is โ(a building \n18  designed to give) protection from bad weather, danger, or attack.โ  Shelter, Cambridge \n19  Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/shelter (last visited July 8, \n20  2021).  And Blackโs Law Dictionary defines โshelterโ as โ[a] place of refuge providing \n21  safety from danger, attack, or observation.โ  Shelter, Blackโs Law Dictionary (11th ed. \n22  2019).       \n23  /// \n24   \n3 To the extent Defendants instead tried to argue at the July 2 hearing that the airport site is a \n25 \ndesignated place individuals can rest within the city limits, that argument also fails.  If Defendants want to \nexempt particular โspacesโ from criminal enforcement, they need to codify those spaces into their rules, \n26 \npaying particular attention to what Martin may require.  It is unlikely that designating an airport tarmac as \nthe one place in the city where individuals may rest without being criminally prosecuted would be a viable \n27 \nargument under Martin.  Regardless, Chico defines โcamp facilitiesโ to include โtemporary shelters,โ Cal. \nMun. Code ยง 9.20.020(B), which seems to mean that it is still illegal for individuals to frequent the airport \n28 \nsite, regardless of whether the City invites them.     \n  5   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 6 of 7\n1    Even Martin, which does not directly answer this question, seems to contemplate \n2  shelter will offer individuals a place to sleep โindoors.โ  920 F.3d at 617.    \n3  Under none of these definitions is the airport site a โshelter.โ  It is an asphalt \n4  tarmac with no roof and no walls, no water and no electricity.  It is an open space with \n5  what amounts to a large umbrella for some shade.  It affords no real cover or protection \n6  to anyone.   \n7  That ends the Courtโs current inquiry.  Since Chicoโs ordinances prohibit \n8  homeless persons from resting on all public property and there is not enough practically-\n9  available shelter within the City, Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success under \n10  Martin, such that the City cannot resort to arresting people or imposing criminal penalties \n11  like fines on homeless persons in violation.4     \n12  Given the likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs have also shown a \n13  likelihood of irreparable harm in the form of the potential violation of their constitutional \n14  rights.  The Cityโs interest in enforcing its health and safety ordinances is not strong \n15  enough to outweigh Plaintiffs interests when balancing the equities and, given the strong \n16  showing that Plaintiffs made on the likelihood of success and irreparable harm, the \n17  public interest also tips in their favor.  Nothing in this Courtโs decision prevents the \n18  enforcement of laws that do not criminalize the status of being homeless โ e.g., public \n19  intoxication laws, destruction of public property, etc.  As such preliminary injunctive relief \n20  is appropriate.   \n21  /// \n \n22 \n4 As straight-forward as the Martin analysis plays out in application of the law to the facts of this \n23  case, the Court understands the practical ramifications for the community are much more complex.  \nIndeed, the concerns raised in the dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc appear to have come to \nfruition in Chico.  See id. 920 F.3d at 594 (โSuch a holding leaves cities with a Hobsonโs choice: They must \n24 \neither undertake an overwhelming financial responsibility to provide housing for or count the number of \nhomeless individuals within their jurisdiction every night, or abandon enforcement of a host of laws \n25 \nregulating public health and safety.โ); id. at 596 (โI fear that the panelโs decision will prohibit local \ngovernments from fulfilling their duty to enforce an array of public health and safety laws.  Halting \n26 \nenforcement of such laws will potentially wreak havoc on our communities.  As we have already begun to \nwitness, our neighborhoods will soon feature โ[t]ents ... equipped with mini refrigerators, cupboards, \n27 \ntelevisions, and heaters, [that] vie with pedestrian trafficโ and โhuman waste appearing on sidewalks and at \nlocal playgrounds.โโ) (footnotes and citations omitted).  The impact on local governments was a foregone \n28  conclusion under Martin.     \n  6   \n \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 110   Filed 07/08/21   Page 7 of 7\n1  CONCLUSION \n2     \n3  Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffsโ motion for a preliminary \n4  injunction is GRANTED.  The TRO already in place is hereby converted to a preliminary \n5  injunction on the same terms previously set forth.

Acknowledging an unprecedented shortage of emergency shelter and affordable \n4  housing, the City of Chico, located in Butte County declared a shelter crisis in October 2018. Just \n5  one month later, the Camp Fire destroyed nearly 14,000 single-family and multifamily homes in \n6  the county, leaving tens of thousands of people in the county homeless. Less than two years later, \n7  in 2020, another wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes. In 2018, when the City of Chico declared \n8  a shelter emergency, there were nearly 1,000 homeless residents in the entire county, hundreds of \n9  whom were unhoused. Today, more than two years after the Camp Fire, the Housing Authority of \n10  the County of Butte estimates that there are more than six thousand households in Chico and its \n11  neighboring town, Oroville that lack permanent housing and are sleeping in tents, cars, and camp \n12  trailers.  \n13  2.  In 2020, the available shelter beds in the region decreased due to the COVID-19 \n14  pandemic. The only congregate shelter in Chico reduced its capacity to reduce the spread of the \n15  virus. The cityโs temporary winter shelter did not open for most of the winter. At the same time, \n16  there is a zero percent rental housing vacancy rate and rents have increased to unaffordable levels \n17  for Chicoโs lowest income residents.  \n18  3.  In December 2020, fully aware of the housing crisis and hundreds, if not thousands \n19  of unhoused community members without access to indoor shelter, the Chico City Council \n20  adopted an ordinance criminalizing camping and remaining after-hours in city parks and open \n21  spaces. The ordinance increased penalties for these acts from administrative citations to criminal \n22  penalties, which permitted the City to arrest and charge unhoused community members with \n23  misdemeanors for resting or sleeping in areas of the city where they were least likely to obstruct \n24  traffic, disturb commercial activity or increase risk of community spread of COVID-19. \n25  4.  In January 2021, the City and Police Department began aggressive enforcement of \n26  the new ordinance and an older citywide ordinance that bans camping on any public property \n27  within city limits. Law enforcement has methodically, location by location, forced unhoused \n28  residents to leave their resting and sleeping places by threatening criminal citation, arrest, and \n  2   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 3 of 33\n \n \n \n1  seizure of the residentsโ property.   \n \n2  5.  These two anti-camping ordinances are part of a larger scheme of local laws that \n3  impose criminal penalties for homeless people when they sleep, sit, lie down, and rest in public. \n4  The city continued enforcing this web of ordinances, even following the devastating wildfire \n5  disasters and pausing only briefly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. According to public \n6  documents, the city made 120 arrests for violations of the citywide anti-camping ordinance \n7  between 2018 and 2020. Through its recent increased enforcement that started on January 7, \n8  2021, the city has enforced its anti-camping ordinances by threatening more than 100 unsheltered \n9  people with arrest at various locations throughout the city. \n10  6.  Defendants actions against involuntarily homeless individuals violate their right to \n11  be free from cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fees, and to due process of the law \n12  under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Defendants \n13  persistent and aggressive enforcement initiative is taking place as the global COVID-19 pandemic \n14  continues to pose immediate danger to the health and safety all people who are unsheltered, and \n15  to the entire community, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n16  7.  Plaintiffs are all involuntarily unhoused residents of Chico. They are at immediate \n17  risk of being cited, arrested and prosecuted for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting and simply existing \n18  in the City of Chico. Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 42 \n19  U.S.C. section 1983.  \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  8.

The City of Chico has had an affordable housing crisis that has persisted for \n7  several years. On October 2, 2018, the city declared a shelter crisis based on a finding that a \n8  significant number of persons located within the City are unable to find shelter. \n9  22.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey of people who are homeless in Butte County \n10  reaffirmed the continuation of this crisis. The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey, which is the most \n11  recent survey completed, found that there were 891 unsheltered, 420 sheltered, and 993 people \n12  sheltered with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support in Butte County. About \n13  43.66 percent of those unsheltered in Butte County live in the City of Chico.  \n14  23.  According to the 2019 Point-In-Time Survey, in Chico alone, there are 571 \n15  unsheltered individuals and 293 sheltered individuals, meaning 66 percent of Chicoโs homeless \n16  population is unsheltered. The report estimated that the actual number is higher, โdue to ongoing \n17  challenges in locating homeless individuals, especially those who are displaced and unhoused due \n18  to the Camp Fire.โ \n19  24.  The number of unhoused individuals and families in Butte County increased \n20  dramatically after the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2020 North Complex Fires. The Housing Authority \n21  of the County of Butte estimates that today as many as six to seven thousand households in \n22  Chico, and its neighboring town, Oroville are unhoused and living in tents or trailers. The \n23  Housing Authority also estimates that within these unhoused households there are 500 school-\n24  aged children.  \n25  25.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey found that 31 percent of all people experiencing \n26  homelessness in Chico reported losing homes in the Camp Fire. Eighty percent of Camp Fire \n27  survivors experiencing homelessness in Chico are unsheltered โ 38 percent of whom report \n28  sleeping with a friend or family in their house or apartment, 30 percent on the street or sidewalk, \n  5   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 6 of 33\n \n \n \n1  14 percent in the park, 8 percent in an outdoor encampment, 5 percent under a bridge/overpass, \n \n2  and 5 percent โother.โ \n3  26.  About 69 percent of people experiencing homelessness in Chico reported in the \n4  2019 Point-in-Time Survey that they are homeless for financial reasons. \n5  27.  On February 2, 2021, a staff report directed to the Chico City Council stated, \n6  โThere is insufficient capacity to shelter everyone experiencing homelessness in Chico.โ \n7  28.  There are only two emergency shelter providers in Chico. These two shelters do \n8  not have sufficient combined capacity for all people who are unsheltered in Chico, and only have \n9  a combined maximum capacity of 130 โ 135 beds due to COVID-19 virus transmission safety \n10  protocols.  \n11  29.  One of the two shelters is the Torres Community Shelter, a year-round congregate \n12  emergency shelter that is available to unsheltered men and women. It also operates a shelter in \n13  another location for families with children. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Torres Shelter \n14  currently has a reduced capacity of 120 beds.  \n15  30.  Guests of the Torres Shelter sleep in a communal setting and are provided meals.  \n16  The shelter has limited ability to provide accommodations for guests with disabilities or medical \n17  conditions who require a special diet, private space or service animals. For the most part, the \n18  shelter cannot accommodate pets.  \n19  31.  The second shelter, Safe Space Winter Shelter, is a temporary winter shelter. \n20  However, it did not open in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, the shelter \n21  opened a medical referral-only shelter in rotating locations with 10 to 15 beds for unsheltered \n22  individuals, including those discharged from Enloe Hospital or Oroville Hospital or referred by \n23  Project Roomkey. The Safe Space Winter Shelter will end in mid-April 2021. The shelter is \n24  currently full and has a waitlist. It is not generally available to people who are unsheltered. \n25  32.  Project Roomkey provides hotel rooms to unhoused people who are vulnerable to \n26  complications from COVID-19, in accordance with Center for Disease Control (CDC) Guidelines \n27  to provide non-congregate sheltering wherever possible and with state and local shelter-in-place \n28  rules and recommendations. While there remain approximately 79 people in the program, Project \n  6   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 7 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Roomkey is no longer available as an emergency shelter. It is only for people who are currently \n \n2  unsheltered if they have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19. \n3  33.  The City of Chico now has fewer shelter beds than it did in 2018 when it declared \n4  a shelter crisis, despite having more people who are unsheltered.  \n5  34.  When Chico declared a shelter crisis, the rental housing vacancy rate was less than \n6  2 percent. One month later, following the Camp Fire, the vacancy rate dropped to nearly zero as \n7  Chico absorbed more than 18,000 new residents between 2018 and 2020, a 20 percent population \n8  increase. During the same period, however, the city added fewer than 3,900 new housing units, an  \n9  increase of only 1.4 percent.  \n10  35.  The HUD Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom unit in Chico increased from $785 \n11  in 2018 to $894 in 2019 and has remained around $900. Actual median rents are higher.  \n12  36.  Nearly one quarter (23.2 percent) of Chico residents live in poverty. This is more \n13  than double the poverty rate of the California, which is 11.8 percent. Butte County also has a high \n14  poverty rate of 16.1 percent.  \n15  37.  Inexplicably, the city rescinded its shelter crisis declaration on April 6, 2021, \n16  despite having more people who are unhoused and fewer emergency shelter options than when it \n17  declared the crisis in 2018. The cityโs action will result in less pubic money to provide shelter and \n18  housing for unhoused community members.  \n19  CHICOโS POLICY AND PRACTICE OF CRIMINALIZING HOMELESSNESS \n20  Chicoโs Laws Punishing Homelessness \n21  38.  In December 2020, the Chico City Council passed Ordinance 2556 to criminalize \n22  violations of the cityโs park regulations in Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12R.04, including \n23  camping in parks and greenways. At the December 8, 2020 Chico City Council meeting in which \n24  the city adopted Ordinance 2556, city staff and city council members said the proposed ordinance \n25  was needed to give the city the authority to criminally cite, arrest, and initiate misdemeanor \n26  charges for violations of the existing park regulations, which previously only allowed the city to \n27  administer a fine. The council passed Ordinance 2556, creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter \n28  12.18 as an urgency ordinance on December 8, 2020. The council voted to enact Ordinance 2556, \n  7   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 8 of 33\n \n \n \n1  creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 as a regular ordinance, on December 15, 2020. \n \n2  39.  Ordinance 2557 applies to thousands of acres of public property in Chico, \n3  including all of the cityโs parks; all city-owned greenways, adjoining all creeks, streams, and \n4  watercourses; and any property purchased by or accepted by the city for use of a park or \n5  playground.  C.M.C. ยง 12.04.010 and 12.18.020(N).  \n6  40.  The land subject to Ordinance 2557 represents nearly all, if not all, of the city-\n7  owned public spaces that are realistically available for people who are unsheltered to \n8  involuntarily sleep and engage in other conduct that is an unavoidable consequence their \n9  unhoused status. The City of Chico spans 27.8 square miles and Bidwell Park alone spans 5.73 \n10  square miles, more than a fifth of the cityโs private and public land.  \n11  41.  Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 states in part: \n12  12.18.430 Camping - Prohibited - Exception - Permit required. \n13  No person or group of persons shall camp overnight or remain or stay overnight within \n14  any city park or playground unlessโฆ the overnight camping or stay is authorized by a \n15  permitโฆ \n16  12.18.450 Closure of parks, greenways and open spaces.  \n17  [I]t is unlawful for any person to be present in any city of Chico or Chico Area Parks and \n18  Recreation District parks, greenways, or open spaces during the hours the parks, \n19  greenways. or open spaces are closed. Unless otherwise posted, closing hours shall be \n20  between the hours of 11 :00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. \n21  42.  Chapter 12.18 does not define โcamp.โ \n22  43.  In addition to Ordinance 2557, the City has multiple ordinances that punish \n23  unhoused people for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting, or simply existing on public property. These \n24  ordinances are all punishable by administrative citation, infraction, or misdemeanor.  \n25  44.  Citywide Camping Prohibition - Chicoโs Municipal Codes 9.20.020 and \n26  9.20.030 prohibits camping on all public property and states in part: \n27  9.20.020 Definitions. \n28  A. โCampโ means to place, pitch or occupy camp facilities; to live temporarily in a camp \n  8   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

On, near or adjacent to any waterway as defined in Section 9.50.020 of this \n17  code. \n18  46.  Sitting on Sidewalks in Commercial Districts - Chico Municipal Code 9.44.015, \n19  which prohibits sitting on sidewalks in commercial districts, states in part: \n20  A. Prohibition. No person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, curb or street, or \n21  upon a blanket, stool, chair or other object placed upon a public sidewalk, curb or street \n22  which is adjacent to any property zoned or used for commercial uses, . . .โ \n23  47.

Between 2018 and 2020, Chico public records provided by the city to Legal \n20  Services of Northern California pursuant to a public records act request show that the Defendants \n21  made 120 arrests for violations of its citywide anti-camping ordinance, Chico Municipal Code \n22  section 9.20.030. During this same time period, the city issued 21 administrative citations for \n23  violations of section 9.20.030.  \n24  53.  Chico police also have a  policy and practice of enforcing the anti-camping \n25  ordinance as well as the other ordinances that prohibit sleeping, sitting, lying, and resting on \n26  public property by warning people to move and threating citation or arrest if they refuse to move. \n27  Public records provided by the City show that between 2018 and 2020, police resolved 968 \n28  citywide calls for service based on complaints of unlawful camping with the disposition \n  10   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 11 of 33\n \n \n \n1  description, โmoved alongโ.1  \n \n2  54.  For unhoused Chico community members resting or sleeping on sidewalks and \n3  other public areas, it is common to be told to move along by the Chico Police, including being \n4  woken up while sleeping and forced to move immediately. Often, officers recommended that \n5  unhoused people move to alternative locations including, other locations within parks and other \n6  public land where unhoused people have traditionally stayed.  \n7  55.  Defendants also have a policy and practice of removing people sleeping outside \n8  from locations by issuing 48-hour or 72-hour notices that inform unhoused community members \n9  they must remove their belongings and leave the location identified on the notice. These notices, \n10  titled โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cite to specific sections of the city municipal code, \n11  including section 9.20.010 et seq., the citywide anti-camping ordinance, and inform the recipient \n12  โ[v]iolations may result in citation or arrest.โ \n13  Chico Increased Enforcement of Its Anti-Camping Ordinances in January 2021 \n14  56.  In early January 2021, soon after the passage of Ordinance 2556, the city and \n15  Police Deparment increased its enforcement of its anti-camping ordinances. On January 7, 2021, \n16  police issued 72-hour notices titled โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ to unhoused community \n17  members who were staying in areas of Bidwell Park called โAnnieโs Glennโ and โHorseshoe \n18  Pits.โ Police issued notices to approximately 50 people that day.  \n19  57.  The โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cites to the Municipal Code Chapter that \n20  contains both the citywide anti-camping and property storage ordinances (CMC ยง 9.20.010 et \n21  seq.), the Park anti-camping ordinance and regulation (CMC ยงยง 12R.18.340, 12.18.430), the \n22  waterway ordinance (CMC ยง 9.50.030), and Penal Code section 647(e).  It threatens recipients \n23  that โ[v]iolations may result in a citation or arrest.โ \n24  58.  The Illegal Encampment Notification also states what will happen to property: \n25  โFailure to remove your property will result in removal by the City of Chico personnel. Any \n26  property that is valued over $100 and all other personal property of reasonable value will be \n27 \n                                                           \n1 This disposition description does not include cases where people left of their own \n28  volition, because the records included a separate category, โgone on arrivalโ. \n  11   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 12 of 33\n \n \n \n1  delivered to the Police Department.โ The notice then provides a phone number to call to retrieve \n \n2  property and says property not retrieved within 90 days will be disposed of.  \n3  59.  The Illegal Encampment Notification asks โDo you need assistance complying \n4  with this order?โ It instructs the recipient to contact the Chico Police Department TARGET Team \n5  at (530) 897-4942.  Upon receiving the notices in January, a number of people staying at Annieโs \n6  Glenn and Horseshoe Pits, called and left messages at the phone number listed for the TARGET \n7  team. The TARGET Team did not answer the phone and did not return the messages. \n8  60.  On January 11, 2021, the Chico Police Department arrived at Bidwell Park to \n9  enforce the notices. Unhoused community members were told they may be cited or arrested if \n10  they did not leave. Over the course of the next few days, the area was cleared of people and their \n11  belongings. Employees from the Public Works Department arrived with a back hoe and dump \n12  truck and collected as waste whatever items unhoused people could not carry with them. The city \n13  threw away tents, tarps, clothing, bedding, and other personal property. \n14  61.  Beginning January 7, 2021, the City of Chico and Police Department issued the \n15  72-hour notices that threaten citation and arrest to at least 100 unhoused community members in \n16  at least seven different locations. Each of these 72-hour notices cites the citywide anti-camping \n17  ordinance (Chico Municipal Code ยง 9.20.010 et seq.) and the park and greenway specific anti-\n18  camping ordinance, Chico Municipal Code ยง 12.18.430. \n19  62.  When the Police TARGET Team was serving the notices, they told unhoused \n20  community members that they would have to remove their property from the encampment by the \n21  expiration of the notice and could not sleep in the park anymore after the parkโs closing hours. \n22  The police TARGET team said if they did not comply, they would be subject to citation and \n23  arrest, and their property would be thrown away. \n24  63.  The officers providing and enforcing the 72-hour warning notices did not provide \n25  any information beyond what was listed in the notice itself, other than to offer bus tickets to leave \n26  Chico. The city has not provided any specific locations where unsheltered people can sleep, sit, \n27  and rest without being subject to citation or arrest. When asked where people can legally sleep in \n28  Chico when there is no shelter available, the response from the City of Chico and the police \n  12   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 13 of 33\n \n \n \n1  department has been the same: people may sleep on a public right-of-way with basic necessities, a \n \n2  sleeping bag and pillow, but no tents or structures. The alleged acceptable place on a right-of-way \n3  is a sidewalk space that does not block entrances, driveways, pedestrian traffic, or vehicle traffic. \n4  Plaintiffs allege based on information and belief that there are no such locations in Chico \n5  sufficient for all people who are involuntarily unsheltered. Further, unhoused community \n6  members who have previously slept in locations to which they were directed by the police were \n7  later threatened with a citation or arrest if they did not leave those locations.  \n8  64.  Defendants issued and enforced the Illegal Encampment Notifications to unhoused \n9  community members on a vacant city-owned residential lot on Boucher Street, on a large grass \n10  traffic median referred to as the โTriangle,โ in parks, and near waterways. In other words, the city \n11  is methodically enforcing its ordinance throughout the city.  \n12  65.  Police gave at least one unhoused community member a criminal citation for a \n13  misdemeanor when he did not remove his belongings from Bidwell Park after receiving a 72-hour \n14  notice in February 2021.  \n15  66.  City leaders have made clear that the police will continue to threaten to cite and \n16  arrest and will follow through on that threat. On January 12, 2021, City of Chico Police Chief \n17  Matt Madden speaking about the Illegal Encampment Notifications stated, โAs we continue to \n18  enforce this law, we hope that we continue to see compliance. If people still refuse to leave after \n19  the 72 hours and have been given the opportunity to do so, we will enforce this law with citations. \n20  This law is a misdemeanor, so physical arrest is also possible.\" \n21  67.  The cityโs intent is to force its unhoused community members out of Chico. City \n22  Councilmember Sean Morgan stated in a radio interview on February 5, 2021:  \n23  \"The police department's going to keep moving them. And they're going to keep moving \n24  them. And the stragglers that just came to Chico, which is the great majority of them, \n25  because it was convenient and it was easy, and they heard somewhere 'I can get needles \n26  and drugs, healthcare, and free camping,' they're gonna go somewhere else. And those are \n27  people that we can't help. Now is there going to be a little pain while that's happening? \n28 \n  13   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Despite Councilmember Sean Morganโs claims, the 2019 Point In Time Survey \n3  shows that the vast majority of unhoused community members have lived in Butte County for \n4  years. More than 75 percent of people reported they lived in Butte County when they became \n5  homeless.  \n6  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNHOUSED RESIDENTS OF CHICO AT RISK FOR CITATION OR \n7  ARREST FOR SLEEPING OUTSIDE \n8  Plaintiff Bobby Warren \n9  69.  Plaintiff Bobby Warren has lived in Chico for about four years.  He became \n10  homeless after he and his spouse divorced and he became ill with cancer.  \n11  70.  Before becoming homeless, Mr. Warren owned a home and ran a business. Right \n12  now, he does not have any income, other than the money he earns from recycling.

Mr. Warrenโs essential personal items have been taken by the police many times \n3  during his four years sleeping outside in Chico. Police have taken, among other items, his \n4  medication, food, and sleeping bag.  \n5  77.  In 2020, Mr. Warren was repeatedly told by Chico Police he could stay with his \n6  belongings in certain areas and then later told he must move from those areas.  \n7  78.  In late 2020, Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay at One Mile Recreation \n8  Area in Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police then told him to go to the corner of Woodland Avenue \n9  and East Fourth Street, near Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay \n10  there because it was not considered part of the park. However, on January 7, 2021 Mr. Warren \n11  received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification for being in this area, where the police \n12  previously told him to go.  \n13  79.  The Illegal Encampment Notification stated โ[v]iolations may result in citation or \n14  arrest.โ  \n15  80.  Mr. Warren is still sleeping outside.  \n16  81.  Mr. Warren cannot stay in a congregate shelter because he has cancer, which puts \n17  him at high risk for death or serious illness if he contracts COVID-19.  \n18  82.  Mr. Warren cannot sleep on a sidewalk or right of away because he is especially \n19  vulnerable to the elements when compared to a person who does not have disabilities. He would \n20  be very anxious about his safety due to being vulnerable to people passing by who may harm him \n21  because he is homeless on the sidewalk. It would be nearly debilitating due to his anxiety \n22  disorder. \n23  83.  Mr. Warren is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n24  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n25  Plaintiff Andy Lambach  \n26  84.  Plaintiff Andy Lambach and his wife Natalie Lambach lived in Paradise, \n27  California for 6 years. On November 8, 2018 they lost their home in the Camp Fire. \n28  85.  After the fire, Mr. Lambach and his wife came to Chico to stay at the Red Cross \n  15   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 16 of 33\n \n \n \n1  shelter for fire survivors. The shelter closed in January 2019, and Mr. Lambach and his wife have \n \n2  been living outdoors in Chico since then.  \n3  86.  Mr. Lambach has no income and survives solely on CalFresh benefits, which \n4  provide a monthly allowance to buy food. He cannot afford to pay for housing.  \n5  87.  Mr. Lambach has congestive heart failure, an injured shoulder that only has 30 \n6  percent use, and a pinched sciatic nerve.  \n7  88.  Mr. Lambach and his wife have a dog, โZeusโ. \n8  89.  Since becoming homeless in Chico, Mr. Lambach has slept at three different \n9  locations. He has been told by the Chico police to leave locations, and has lost personal \n10  belongings that he was not able to carry away with him.   \n11  90.  In one instance, Mr. Lambach and his wife were sleeping on the south side of \n12  Comanche Creek in Chico. One day he and his wife left the area and came back to find their \n13  belongings gone. Mr. Lambach learned from other people sleeping in the area that the Chico \n14  Police had come to area and went tent to tent. If there was a tent without anyone there, the police \n15  threw that tent and the items in it away. Mr. Lambach did not receive any notice that this was \n16  going to happen and police did not leave a notice telling him how to retrieve his belongings.  \n17  91.  In August 2020, when Mr. Lambach was still sleeping on the south side of \n18  Comanche Creek, he received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification. The notice told him he \n19  was at risk for citation or arrest if he did not remove his belongings from the area.  \n20  92.  When the police came to enforce the notice, the Chico police told Mr. Lambach \n21  and other unhoused residents sleeping in the area that if they did not leave and take their \n22  belongings they would be arrested and their belongings would be thrown away.  \n23  93.  A park ranger told Mr. Lambach and others sleeping in the area that they could go \n24  to the north side of Comanche Creek and would be left alone as long as they stayed at least 50 \n25  feet from the creek.  \n26  94.  However, on April 8, 2021 Mr. Lambach received a 72-hour notice threatening \n27  citation or arrest if he does not leave the area police previously directed him to.  \n28  95.  Mr. Lambach cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to the pain it will cause because of \n  16   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 17 of 33\n \n \n \n1  his injured shoulder and pinched sciatic nerve.  \n \n2  96.  Due to his congestive heart failure, he is in a high risk group for becoming \n3  seriously ill if he contracts COVID-19, and is therefore at risk for serious illness or death if he \n4  were to stay at a congregate shelter.  \n5  97.  Mr. Lambach is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n6  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n7  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson \n8  98.  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson has been a resident of Chico, California for 6 years. \n9  Ms. Thompson had a rent-to-own contract for a house, and then discovered the person she paid \n10  rent to was not the legal owner. She was then physically removed from the home and became \n11  homeless.  \n12  99.  Ms. Thompson has multiple physical disabilities.  She has a condition that makes \n13  it difficult to feel and close her hand, an injured hip, an injured back, and weak lungs due to a \n14  having contracted pneumonia in the past. \n15  100.  Ms. Thompson also has depression. She has dogs to cope with her depression.  \n16  101.  Ms. Thompson has no stable source of income and cannot afford to pay for \n17  housing.  \n18  102.  When she first became homeless, Ms. Thompson moved back and forth between \n19  sleeping in the bike path between Guill Street and near the 20th Street Community Park in Chico \n20  and sleeping in the park itself. The Chico police repeatedly told Ms. Thompson she had to leave \n21  these locations.  \n22  103.  After six months of moving back and forth on 20th Street, Ms. Thompson slept at \n23  the Lindo Channel for about 2 to 3 months until the police told her that in a week they would be \n24  giving camping citations to anyone who was still in Lindo Channel. Fearing a citation, she left the \n25  Lindo Channel. \n26  104.  Ms. Thompson then slept in One Mile Recreation Area in Bidwell Park. She \n27  would remain in one location in the park until the police would tell her to move. She would then \n28  move to another location until the police told her to move again. Eventually, Ms. Thompson \n  17   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 18 of 33\n \n \n \n1  moved out of Bidwell Park due to the Chico police constantly telling her to move but not telling \n \n2  her where she could go. \n3  105.  Ms. Thompson then slept at various locations in Chico. She eventually left each \n4  place because the police told her she had to remove her belongings and leave.  \n5  106.  Ms. Thompson was cited and convicted of infractions in 2017 and again in 2018 \n6  camping outside on public land. The 2017 conviction was for violating the Chico regulation \n7  against camping in a city park, while the 2018 conviction was for violating the Chico ordinance \n8  against camping near a waterway. She received a $483 fine in each case. \n9  107.  Ms. Thompson has lost personal belongings that she could not carry away when \n10  forced to leave locations by the police.  \n11  108.  During one encounter with the Chico police, a police officer told Ms. Thompson \n12  that he is not saying that she should not be homeless, but that she should not be homeless in \n13  Chico. \n14  109.  On August 10, 2020, when Ms. Thompson was sleeping on the south side of \n15  Comanche Creek, Officer Sandoval of the Chico Police Department told Ms. Thompson and \n16  others at the creek to move to the north side of the creek. Officer Sandoval told Ms. Thompson \n17  that she needed to move to the northside by the morning of August 12, 2020. Officer Sandoval \n18  said that if was not out by August 12, then the Chico Police Department would take care of it and \n19  take all of her belongings. \n20  110.  On April 8, 2021 Ms. Thompson received a 72-hour notice threatening citation or \n21  arrest if she does not leave the area to which police previously directed her. \n22  111.  The police have not told Ms. Thompson where she can legally and safely move \n23  and sleep.  \n24  112.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep at a congregate shelter because she is at risk for \n25  becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, due to her history of contracting pneumonia.  \n26  113.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to her injured hip and back.  \n27  114.  Ms. Thompson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is \n28  sleeping outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n  18   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 19 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams \n \n2  115.  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams has been without a home in Chico for 3 years. He \n3  came to Chico to resolve some child support issues he had with the county. When he arrived he \n4  could not find affordable housing. \n5  116.  Mr. Williams has arthritis, no vertebrae on the bottom of his spine, schizophrenia, \n6  manic depression, and bipolar disorder. \n7  117.  Mr. Williams has a dog, โGeorgiaโ that helps him cope with his mental \n8  disabilities. \n9  118.  When Mr. Williams first started sleeping on the streets the police would tell him to \n10  move or they would arrest or cite him. \n11  119.  In March or April 2020 he began to stay on the southside of Comanche Creek. \n12  During his stay there the police told him that he needed to move he would be arrested or cited. \n13  Mr. Williams moved to another area along the southside of the creek. \n14  120.  A few months later around August 2020, the Chico Police Department gave \n15  everyone on the southside of the creek notices to vacate. They recommended that they move to \n16  the northside of the creek. Mr. Williams moved to the northside of the creek but left after about \n17  two weeks because it was so crowded there. \n18  121.  Mr. Williams then stayed at One Mile Park until late February or early March, \n19  2021 when the Chico Police Department gave the people staying there 72-hour notices to vacate. \n20  The police told Mr. Williams that he could move to a public space if he did not block a right of \n21  way. \n22  122.  Mr. Williams then moved to bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n23  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. However, the police have \n24  told him he will need to move again.  \n25  123.  Mr. Williams cannot stay in congregate housing because his mental disabilities \n26  require that he stay with his dog, and he does not know if he can bring the dog into these shelters. \n27  His disabilities also make him increasingly stressed and claustrophobic when in shelters that have \n28  strict rules and policies. \n  19   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 20 of 33\n \n \n \n1  124.  Mr. Williams cannot sleep on the sidewalk due to the missing vertebrae in his \n \n2  lower back. \n3  125.  Mr. Williams is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n4  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n5  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson \n6  126.  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson is 62 years old and has been a resident of Chico since \n7  1961. He last had stable housing about 8 years ago when the person he cared for as a live-in \n8  caretaker passed away.  \n9  127.  Since Mr. Samuelson lost his housing he has received citations for camping 7 \n10  times in Chico. Five of these citations were in 2013 under City of Chico municipal code section \n11  12R.04.340. One citation was in 2018 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.20.030. One \n12  citation was in 2019 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.50.030C. \n13  128.  Mr. Samuelson estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n14  him and take his belongings approximately 20 times. \n15  129.  In the spring of 2020, Mr. Samuelson began to sleep at One Mile Park. In January \n16  2021 he was given a 72-hour notice to vacate. He was told that if he was not gone in 72 hours \n17  then the police would take his belongings, charge him with a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. \n18  Samuelson asked where he could move and he was told any public right of way where he was not \n19  blocking access. \n20  130.  Mr. Samuelson then moved northwest of Highway 99 in Bidwell Park. He stayed \n21  there until the police gave him another 72-hour notice on February 22, 2021. The police again \n22  told him that if he was not gone in 72 hours then they would take his belongings, charge him with \n23  a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. Samuelson asked where he could move and was again told \n24  any public right of way where he was not blocking access. The police said that a bike path would \n25  be fine if he was not blocking it. \n26  131.  Mr. Samuelson then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th \n27  Street Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. He placed all of his \n28  belongings to the side of the path so that he would not block access. \n  20   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 21 of 33\n \n \n \n1  132.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n \n2  Mr. Samuelson to expect notices to vacate soon. \n3  133.  Mr. Samuelson cannot go into the Torres Shelter because he fears contracting \n4  COVID-19 in such a confined and populated space. He fears that, due to his age, he is more \n5  vulnerable to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer serious harm, or death, if he contracts the \n6  virus. \n7  134.  Mr. Samuelson has tried to sleep on the sidewalk in the past but the Chico Police \n8  Department told him to move. \n9  135.  Mr. Samuelson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n10  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n11  Plaintiff Tracy Miller \n12  136.  Plaintiff Tracy Miller is 58 years old and has been unhoused for 2 years because he \n13  is unable to afford any housing on his very limited income. \n14  137.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Miller stayed in the Safe Space Winter \n15  Shelter until it closed.  \n16  138.  He then began sleeping outdoors near the Jesus Center where he received food and \n17  mail services, and then at the Triangle until February 2021 when he received a 72-hour notice that \n18  he had to leave and take his property. He complied with the notice to avoid arrest and moved to \n19  vacant, city-owned land at Boucher Street between Wisconsin Street and Little Chico Creek.  \n20  139.  At the Boucher Street location, Mr. Miller and others sleeping there were verbally \n21  harassed by neighbors and in mid-February 2021 he received a 72-hour notice that police \n22  enforced on February 16, 2021, telling Mr. Miller they would throw away any property he left \n23  behind. \n24  140.  Mr. Miller took his belongings and went to Humboldt/Windchime Park, but again \n25  he received a 72-hour notice from the Chico Police Department to leave and take all his \n26  belongings. He left the park when police came to enforce the notices on April 1, 2021 to avoid \n27  being arrested.  \n28  141.  Mr. Miller has a dog and believes the local shelter will not allow him in with his \n  21   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 22 of 33\n \n \n \n1  dog.  \n \n2  142.  Mr. Miller is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n3  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n4  Plaintiff Tona Petersen \n5  143.  Plaintiff Tona Petersen is 55 years old and has been unhoused since she lost her \n6  home in the town of Paradise in the 2018 Camp Fire. \n7  144.  Immediately after the Camp Fire, Ms. Petersen evacuated to Oroville with her \n8  fiancรฉe, but due to her fiancรฉeโs violence she soon entered the Catalyst confidential shelter for \n9  domestic violence survivors where she remained until February 2019.  \n10  145.  As a result of trauma from the Camp Fire and domestic violence, Ms. Petersen has \n11  post-traumatic stress disorder, which causes panic attacks, as well as bipolar disorder and \n12  borderline personality disorder. Ms. Petersen also has a seizure disorder, a history of stroke, a \n13  heart murmur and asthma.  \n14  146.  Ms. Petersen has slept at the Comanche Creek Greenway, an open space that \n15  begins at the intersection of Park Avenue, East Park Avenue and Midway, since she left the \n16  Catalyst shelter in 2019. This location permits her to maintain distance from other people, which \n17  is essential to her controlling her mental health symptoms. \n18  147.  Ms. Petersen is unable to live in a congregate shelter environment because close \n19  interactions with other people trigger severe symptoms related to her significant mental health \n20  conditions.  \n21  148.  Her physical disabilities prevent her from safely sleeping on a sidewalk and make \n22  her particularly susceptible to severe illness should she contract COVID-19 and she sought access \n23  to safe shelter through Project Roomkey and learned she was selected for that program, but that \n24  due to her homelessness the coordinators were unable to locate her to inform her, so she was \n25  returned to that programโs waiting list. \n26  149.  Due to very limited income from unemployment insurance and collecting cans for \n27  recycling, Ms. Petersen is unable to afford rental housing. \n28  150.  Ms. Petersen is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n  22   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 23 of 33\n \n \n \n1  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n \n2  Plaintiff Christa Stevens \n3  151.  Plaintiff Christa Stevens has been without stable housing in Chico for 8 years.  \n4  152.  In the last 8 years Ms. Stevens has received 3 citations based on her inability to \n5  find stable housing. One of these citations was in 2018 for Unlawful Camping under City of \n6  Chico municipal code section 12R.04.340. One of these citations was 2019 for Unlawful Storage \n7  of Personal Property on Any Public Parking Lot or Public Area under City of Chico municipal \n8  code section 9.20.050C. Another citation was in 2019 for staying a park after closure under City \n9  of Chico municipal code section 12R.04.370B(4) \n10  153.  Ms. Stevens estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n11  her or give her a citation approximately 40 times in the last 8 years. \n12  154.  Five years ago, Ms. Stevens was sleeping at Depot Park when the Chico Police \n13  Officer told her and her boyfriend that they had too many belongings. The officer took her three \n14  bags of belongings, threw them into the back of his car and said โnow you gotta find new shit.โ \n15  She never got her belongings back. \n16  155.  In fall 2019 Ms. Stevens began to sleep in the area of Bidwell Park northeast of \n17  Highway 99. On February 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department gave her a 72-hour notice to \n18  vacate. The police told Ms. Stevens that if she was not gone in 72 hours then the police would \n19  take her belongings, charge her with a misdemeanor, and arrest her.  \n20  156.  The police told Ms. Stevens that she could move to a public right of way where \n21  she was not blocking access. The police said a bike path would be fine if she did not block the \n22  path. \n23  157.  Ms. Stevens then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n24  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions.  She placed her belongings \n25  to the side of the path so that she would not be blocking peopleโs access.  \n26  158.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n27  Ms. Stevens to expect notices to vacate soon. \n28  159.  Ms. Stevens cannot stay in the Torres Shelter because she fears contracting \n  23   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 24 of 33\n \n \n \n1  COVID-19 in the confined and populated space. Ms. Stevens also has a dog that helps her cope \n \n2  with her anxiety and makes her feel safe when outside. Ms. Stevens does not believe that she can \n3  safely bring her dog into the Torres Shelter. \n4  160.  Ms. Stevens has tried sleeping on the sidewalk in the past and the Chico Police \n5  Department would tell her to move. \n6  161.  Ms. Stevens is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n7  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n8  IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS TO UNHOUSED PERSONS FORCIBLY \n9  REMOVED FROM ENCAMPMENTS \n10  162.  More than 530,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States in the last \n11  year. More than 56,000 Californians have died of COVID-19.  \n12  163.  In April 2020, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued \n13  โInterim Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for \n14  Homeless Service Providers and Local Officialsโ (CDC Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness).  \n15  164.  This guidance explains that โ[s]ome people who are experiencing unsheltered \n16  homelessness may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to older age or \n17  certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions.โ  \n18  165.  The CDC specifically tells local jurisdiction they should not take action to clear \n19  encampments: โIf individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living \n20  unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing encampments can cause \n21  people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This \n22  increases the potential for infectious disease spread.โ  \n23  166.  The CDC advises local jurisdictions to take the following actions rather than \n24  clearing encampments:  \n25  a.  โEncourage those staying in encampments to set up their tents/sleeping quarters \n26  with at least 12 feet x 12 feet of space per individual.โ \n27  b.  โIf an encampment is not able to provide sufficient space for each person, allow \n28  people to remain where they are but help decompress the encampment by linking \n  24   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 25 of 33\n \n \n \n1  those at increased risk for severe illness to individual rooms or safe shelter.โ \n \n2  c.  โWork together with community coalition members to improve sanitation in \n3  encampments.โ \n4  d.  โEnsure nearby restroom facilities have functional water taps, are stocked with \n5  hand hygiene materials (soap, drying materials) and bath tissue, and remain open \n6  to people experiencing homelessness 24 hours per day.โ \n7  e.  โIf toilets or handwashing facilities are not available nearby, assist with providing \n8  access to portable latrines with handwashing facilities for encampments of more \n9  than 10 people. These facilities should be equipped with hand sanitizer (containing \n10  at least 60% alcohol).โ \n11  167.  The CDC Guidance was first issued in April 2020 when the COVID-19 rates if \n12  infection were far less than they are currently in the United States, California, and Butte County.  \n13  168.  The CDC has continued to update and reaffirm its guidance, as recently as March \n14  21, 2021. \n15  169.  The City of Chico is not abiding by the CDC guidance. On December 8, 2020 and \n16  15, 2020, the City Council voted to allow the city police to conducts sweeps of encampments in \n17  the city, knowing these actions violate the CDCโs guidance.  \n18  170.  The city is also forcing unhoused residents to move from one location to another \n19  within the city. The city is also threatening to confiscate unhoused community membersโ essential \n20  items that are needed to help guard against COVID-19, such as tents.  \n21  171.  The cityโs ordinances, and policy and practice of banning tents, puts unhoused \n22  people at higher risk for contracting COVID-19, and increases the risks of bodily harm from \n23  exposure-related conditions like hypothermia during colder and wetter seasons and heat stroke \n24  during warmer, dryer seasons.  \n25  172.  These health risks are especially acute for people with disabilities. The 2019 Point-\n26  In-Time count found that a significant amount of Chicoโs unhoused community members have \n27  physical and/or mental disabilities. Around 47 percent have a chronic health disability, 15 percent \n28  have a developmental disability, 44 percent have a mental health disability, and 39 percent have a \n  25   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 26 of 33\n \n \n \n1  physical disability. \n \n2  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n3  173.  At all relevant times, Defendants and their agents acted under color of state law \n4  and within the scope of their employment.  \n5  174.  Defendants' actions and conduct have resulted and will result in irreparable injury \n6  to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law to address the wrongs \n7  described herein. Defendants have made it clear by their previous and ongoing actions that they \n8  intend to continue the unlawful conduct described above.  Defendants have a policy and practice \n9  of  (1) confiscating and destroying the personal property of individual Plaintiffs and similarly \n10  situated homeless individuals without legal basis; and (2) criminalizing individual Plaintiffsโ \n11  ability to rest and perform other unavoidable acts of survival in public places. Defendants have \n12  and will continue to participate in implementing this policy and practice unless and until \n13  restrained by an injunctive decree of this Court. \n14  175.  The acts of Defendants as alleged above constituted violations of individual \n15  Plaintiffsโ established constitutional rights. Defendants knew or should have known that their \n16  conduct in seizing and destroying individual Plaintiffs' personal property  that Defendants \n17  determined was valued as less than $100 or not of reasonable value was inconsistent with \n18  individual Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, and they knew or should have known that citing, \n19  arresting, and issuing notices threatening criminal prosecution for the Chico Municipal \n20  Ordinances discussed herein violates the Eighth Amendment. \n21  176.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants because \n22  Defendants have engaged in the unlawful and unconstitutional conduct as alleged and intend to \n23  continue this unlawful conduct as an ongoing practice and policy of Defendants. Plaintiffs seek a \n24  declaration that the prosecution and threat of prosecution and imposition of criminal penalties for \n25  involuntary conduct associated with being homeless and the seizure and destruction of personal \n26  property without proper notices, warrants, or hearing rights is unlawful and unconstitutional. \n27  177.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ unconstitutional and unlawful \n28  policies, practices and conduct, individual Plaintiffs have suffered, and will continue to suffer \n  26   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 27 of 33\n \n \n \n1  damages, including but not limited to: (1) having no place to sleep, rest, or lie without harassment \n \n2  and criminal punishment by Defendants; and (2) the deprivation and destruction of property, \n3  including clothing, bedding, medication, personal documents and other personal possessions, \n4  leaving them without their essential personal belongings necessary for shelter, health, wellbeing \n5  and personal dignity. \n6   \n7  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n8  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n9  Cruel and Unusual Punishment; Excessive Fines \n10  (Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; 42 U.S.C. ยง1983; Art. 7) \n11  178.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n12  fully set forth herein. \n13  179.  The acts and omissions of Defendants, as described herein, violate the \n14  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs to be free from actual or threatened cruel and unusual \n15  punishment and excessive fines.

The City of Chico  and City of Chico Police Department have a policy and practice \n19  of forcibly removing Plaintiffs who are involuntarily sleeping overnight from public property, \n20  including all parks, waterways, and city-owned properties. This has the effect of a citywide ban \n21  that does not allow for Plaintiffs to maintain life-sustaining activities that are the unavoidable \n22  consequence of being without housing.  \n23  181.  Defendants have a custom, policy, and/or practice of encouraging its officers to \n24  threaten and to cite or arrest homeless people for sleeping or having property in public, which is \n25  unavoidable behavior due to their unhoused status. \n26  182.  There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendants concerning the \n27  continued threat of citation and arrest if Plaintiffs remain on public property, in parks, waterways, \n28  and other city-owned properties. Defendants will continue enforcement throughout the city and \n  27   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 2 of 31\n \n \n \n1  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n2  1.  Acknowledging an unprecedented shortage of emergency shelter and affordable \n3  housing, the City of Chico, located in Butte County declared a shelter crisis in October 2018. Just \n4  one month later, the Camp Fire destroyed nearly 14,000 single-family and multifamily homes in \n5  the county, leaving tens of thousands of people in the county homeless. Less than two years later, \n6  in 2020, another wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes. In 2018, when the City of Chico declared \n7  a shelter emergency, there were nearly 1,000 homeless residents in the entire county, hundreds of \n8  whom were unhoused. Today, more than two years after the Camp Fire, the Housing Authority of \n9  the County of Butte estimates that there are more than six thousand households in Chico and its \n10  neighboring town, Oroville that lack permanent housing and are sleeping in tents, cars, and camp \n11  trailers.  \n12  2.  In 2020, the available shelter beds in the region decreased due to the COVID-19 \n13  pandemic. The only congregate shelter in Chico reduced its capacity to reduce the spread of the \n14  virus. The cityโs temporary winter shelter did not open for most of the winter. At the same time, \n15  there is a zero percent rental housing vacancy rate and rents have increased to unaffordable levels \n16  for Chicoโs lowest income residents.  \n17  3.  In December 2020, fully aware of the housing crisis and hundreds, if not thousands \n18  of unhoused community members without access to indoor shelter, the Chico City Council \n19  adopted an ordinance criminalizing camping and remaining after-hours in city parks and open \n20  spaces. The ordinance increased penalties for these acts from administrative citations to criminal \n21  penalties, which permitted the City to arrest and charge unhoused community members with \n22  misdemeanors for resting or sleeping in areas of the city where they were least likely to obstruct \n23  traffic, disturb commercial activity or increase risk of community spread of COVID-19. \n24  4.  In January 2021, the City began aggressive enforcement of the new ordinance and \n25  an older citywide ordinance that bans camping on any public property within city limits. Law \n26  enforcement has methodically, location by location, forced unhoused residents to leave their \n27  resting and sleeping places by threatening criminal citation, arrest, and seizure of the residentsโ \n28  property.   \n  2   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 3 of 31\n \n \n \n1  5.  These two anti-camping ordinances are part of a larger scheme of local laws that \n \n2  impose criminal penalties for homeless people when they sleep, sit, lie down, and rest in public. \n3  The city continued enforcing this web of ordinances, even following the devastating wildfire \n4  disasters and pausing only briefly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. According to public \n5  documents, the city made 120 arrests for violations of the citywide anti-camping ordinance \n6  between 2018 and 2020. Through its recent increased enforcement that started on January 7, \n7  2021, the city has enforced its anti-camping ordinances by threatening more than 100 unsheltered \n8  people with arrest at various locations throughout the city. \n9  6.  The cityโs actions against involuntarily homeless individuals violate their right to \n10  be free from cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fees, and to due process of the law \n11  under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The cityโs \n12  persistent and aggressive enforcement initiative is taking place as the global COVID-19 pandemic \n13  continues to pose immediate danger to the health and safety all people who are unsheltered, and \n14  to the entire community, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n15  7.  Plaintiffs are all involuntarily unhoused residents of Chico. They are at immediate \n16  risk of being cited, arrested and prosecuted for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting and simply existing \n17  in the City of Chico. Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 42 \n18  U.S.C. section 1983.  \n19  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20  8.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based upon the \n21  violations of Plaintiffsโ rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n22  United States Constitution. Jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. sections 1331 (federal \n23  question jurisdiction) and 1343 (civil rights jurisdiction). Jurisdiction also exists under the \n24  Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง2201(a) and 2202. \n25  9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the related state law claims pursuant \n26  to 28 U.S.C. section 1367(a) because those claims form part of the same case or controversy \n27  under Article III of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffsโ state law claims share all common \n28  operative facts with their federal law claims, and the parties are identical. Resolving Plaintiffโs \n  3   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 4 of 31\n \n \n \n1  federal and state claims in a single action serves the interests of judicial economy, convenience, \n \n2  consistency, and fairness to the parties. \n3  10.

The City of Chico has had an affordable housing crisis that has persisted for \n6  several years. On October 2, 2018, the city declared a shelter crisis based on a finding that a \n7  significant number of persons located within the City are unable to find shelter. \n8  22.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey of people who are homeless in Butte County \n9  reaffirmed the continuation of this crisis. The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey, which is the most \n10  recent survey completed, found that there were 891 unsheltered, 420 sheltered, and 993 people \n11  sheltered with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support in Butte County. About \n12  43.66 percent of those unsheltered in Butte County live in the City of Chico.  \n13  23.  According to the 2019 Point-In-Time Survey, in Chico alone, there are 571 \n14  unsheltered individuals and 293 sheltered individuals, meaning 66 percent of Chicoโs homeless \n15  population is unsheltered. The report estimated that the actual number is higher, โdue to ongoing \n16  challenges in locating homeless individuals, especially those who are displaced and unhoused due \n17  to the Camp Fire.โ \n18  24.  The number of unhoused individuals and families in Butte County increased \n19  dramatically after the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2020 North Complex Fires. The Housing Authority \n20  of the County of Butte estimates that today as many as six to seven thousand households in \n21  Chico, and its neighboring town, Oroville are unhoused and living in tents or trailers. The \n22  Housing Authority also estimates that within these unhoused households there are 500 school-\n23  aged children.  \n24  25.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey found that 31 percent of all people experiencing \n25  homelessness in Chico reported losing homes in the Camp Fire. Eighty percent of Camp Fire \n26  survivors experiencing homelessness in Chico are unsheltered โ 38 percent of whom report \n27  sleeping with a friend or family in their house or apartment, 30 percent on the street or sidewalk, \n28  14 percent in the park, 8 percent in an outdoor encampment, 5 percent under a bridge/overpass, \n  5   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 6 of 31\n \n \n \n1  and 5 percent โother.โ \n \n2  26.  About 69 percent of people experiencing homelessness in Chico reported in the \n3  2019 Point-in-Time Survey that they are homeless for financial reasons. \n4  27.  On February 2, 2021, a staff report directed to the Chico City Council stated, \n5  โThere is insufficient capacity to shelter everyone experiencing homelessness in Chico.โ \n6  28.  There are only two emergency shelter providers in Chico. These two shelters do \n7  not have sufficient combined capacity for all people who are unsheltered in Chico, and only have \n8  a combined maximum capacity of 130 โ 135 beds due to COVID-19 virus transmission safety \n9  protocols.  \n10  29.  One of the two shelters is the Torres Community Shelter, a year-round congregate \n11  emergency shelter that is available to unsheltered men and women. It also operates a shelter in \n12  another location for families with children. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Torres Shelter \n13  currently has a reduced capacity of 120 beds.  \n14  30.  Guests of the Torres Shelter sleep in a communal setting and are provided meals.  \n15  The shelter has limited ability to provide accommodations for guests with disabilities or medical \n16  conditions who require a special diet, private space or service animals. For the most part, the \n17  shelter cannot accommodate pets.  \n18  31.  The second shelter, Safe Space Winter Shelter, is a temporary winter shelter. \n19  However, it did not open in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, the shelter \n20  opened a medical referral-only shelter in rotating locations with 10 to 15 beds for unsheltered \n21  individuals, including those discharged from Enloe Hospital or Oroville Hospital or referred by \n22  Project Roomkey. The Safe Space Winter Shelter will end in mid-April 2021. The shelter is \n23  currently full and has a waitlist. It is not generally available to people who are unsheltered. \n24  32.  Project Roomkey provides hotel rooms to unhoused people who are vulnerable to \n25  complications from COVID-19, in accordance with Center for Disease Control (CDC) Guidelines \n26  to provide non-congregate sheltering wherever possible and with state and local shelter-in-place \n27  rules and recommendations. While there remain approximately 79 people in the program, Project \n28  Roomkey is no longer available as an emergency shelter. It is only for people who are currently \n  6   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 7 of 31\n \n \n \n1  unsheltered if they have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19. \n \n2  33.  The City of Chico now has fewer shelter beds than it did in 2018 when it declared \n3  a shelter crisis, despite having more people who are unsheltered.  \n4  34.  When Chico declared a shelter crisis, the rental housing vacancy rate was less than \n5  2 percent. One month later, following the Camp Fire, the vacancy rate dropped to nearly zero as \n6  Chico absorbed more than 18,000 new residents between 2018 and 2020, a 20 percent population \n7  increase. During the same period, however, the city added fewer than 3,900 new housing units, an  \n8  increase of only 1.4 percent.  \n9  35.  The HUD Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom unit in Chico increased from $785 \n10  in 2018 to $894 in 2019 and has remained around $900. Actual median rents are higher.  \n11  36.  Nearly one quarter (23.2 percent) of Chico residents live in poverty. This is more \n12  than double the poverty rate of the California, which is 11.8 percent. Butte County also has a high \n13  poverty rate of 16.1 percent.  \n14  37.  Inexplicably, the city rescinded its shelter crisis declaration on April 6, 2021, \n15  despite having more people who are unhoused and fewer emergency shelter options than when it \n16  declared the crisis in 2018. The cityโs action will result in less pubic money to provide shelter and \n17  housing for unhoused community members.  \n18  CHICOโS POLICY AND PRACTICE OF CRIMINALIZING HOMELESSNESS \n19  Chicoโs Laws Punishing Homelessness \n20  38.  In December 2020, the Chico City Council passed Ordinance 2556 to criminalize \n21  violations of the cityโs park regulations in Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12R.04, including \n22  camping in parks and greenways. At the December 8, 2020 Chico City Council meeting in which \n23  the city adopted Ordinance 2556, city staff and city council members said the proposed ordinance \n24  was needed to give the city the authority to criminally cite, arrest, and initiate misdemeanor \n25  charges for violations of the existing park regulations, which previously only allowed the city to \n26  administer a fine. The council passed Ordinance 2556, creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter \n27  12.18 as an urgency ordinance on December 8, 2020. The council voted to enact Ordinance 2556, \n28  creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 as a regular ordinance, on December 15, 2020. \n  7   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 8 of 31\n \n \n \n1  39.  Ordinance 2557 applies to thousands of acres of public property in Chico, \n \n2  including all of the cityโs parks; all city-owned greenways, adjoining all creeks, streams, and \n3  watercourses; and any property purchased by or accepted by the city for use of a park or \n4  playground.  C.M.C. ยง 12.04.010 and 12.18.020(N).  \n5  40.  The land subject to Ordinance 2557 represents nearly all, if not all, of the city-\n6  owned public spaces that are realistically available for people who are unsheltered to \n7  involuntarily sleep and engage in other conduct that is an unavoidable consequence their \n8  unhoused status. The City of Chico spans 27.8 square miles and Bidwell Park alone spans 5.73 \n9  square miles, more than a fifth of the cityโs private and public land.  \n10  41.  Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 states in part: \n11  12.18.430 Camping - Prohibited - Exception - Permit required. \n12  No person or group of persons shall camp overnight or remain or stay overnight within \n13  any city park or playground unlessโฆ the overnight camping or stay is authorized by a \n14  permitโฆ \n15  12.18.450 Closure of parks, greenways and open spaces.  \n16  [I]t is unlawful for any person to be present in any city of Chico or Chico Area Parks and \n17  Recreation District parks, greenways, or open spaces during the hours the parks, \n18  greenways. or open spaces are closed. Unless otherwise posted, closing hours shall be \n19  between the hours of 11 :00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. \n20  42.  Chapter 12.18 does not define โcamp.โ \n21  43.  In addition to Ordinance 2557, the City has multiple ordinances that punish \n22  unhoused people for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting, or simply existing on public property. These \n23  ordinances are all punishable by administrative citation, infraction, or misdemeanor.  \n24  44.  Citywide Camping Prohibition - Chicoโs Municipal Codes 9.20.020 and \n25  9.20.030 prohibits camping on all public property and states in part: \n26  9.20.020 Definitions. \n27  A. โCampโ means to place, pitch or occupy camp facilities; to live temporarily in a camp \n28  facility or outdoors \n  8   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v.

Any park; \n13  B.  Any street; \n14  C.  Any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved; and \n15  D.  On, near or adjacent to any waterway as defined in Section 9.50.020 of this \n16  code. \n17  46.  Sitting on Sidewalks in Commercial Districts - Chico Municipal Code 9.44.015, \n18  which prohibits sitting on sidewalks in commercial districts, states in part: \n19  A. Prohibition. No person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, curb or street, or \n20  upon a blanket, stool, chair or other object placed upon a public sidewalk, curb or street \n21  which is adjacent to any property zoned or used for commercial uses, . . .โ \n22  47.

Park Regulations - The City also has park regulations, including 12R.04.340, \n12  which states in part:  \n13  No person or group of persons shall camp overnight or remain or stay overnight within \n14  any city park or playground unlessโฆ the overnight camping or stay is authorized by a \n15  permitโฆ The park regulations are punishable by a fine. \n16  Chico Arrests, Cites, and Threatens to Arrest Unhoused Community Members Sleeping on \n17  Public Property \n18  52.  Between 2018 and 2020, Chico public records provided by the city to Legal \n19  Services of Northern California pursuant to a public records act request show that the city made \n20  120 arrests for violations of its citywide anti-camping ordinance, Chico Municipal Code section \n21  9.20.030. During this same time period, the city issued 21 administrative citations for violations \n22  of section 9.20.030.  \n23  53.  Chico police also have a  policy and practice of enforcing the anti-camping \n24  ordinance as well as the other ordinances that prohibit sleeping, sitting, lying, and resting on \n25  public property by warning people to move and threating citation or arrest if they refuse to move. \n26  Public records provided by the City show that between 2018 and 2020, police resolved 968 \n27  citywide calls for service based on complaints of unlawful camping with the disposition \n28 \n  10   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 11 of 31\n \n \n \n1  description, โmoved alongโ.1  \n \n2  54.  For unhoused Chico community members resting or sleeping on sidewalks and \n3  other public areas, it is common to be told to move along by the Chico Police, including being \n4  woken up while sleeping and forced to move immediately. Often, officers recommended that \n5  unhoused people move to alternative locations including, other locations within parks and other \n6  public land where unhoused people have traditionally stayed.  \n7  55.  The city also has a policy and practice of removing people sleeping outside from \n8  locations by issuing 48-hour or 72-hour notices that inform unhoused community members they \n9  must remove their belongings and leave the location identified on the notice. These notices, titled \n10  โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cite to specific sections of the city municipal code, including \n11  section 9.20.010 et seq., the citywide anti-camping ordinance, and inform the recipient \n12  โ[v]iolations may result in citation or arrest.โ \n13  Chico Increased Enforcement of Its Anti-Camping Ordinances in January 2021 \n14  56.  In early January 2021, soon after the passage of Ordinance 2556, the city increased \n15  its enforcement of its anti-camping ordinances. On January 7, 2021, police issued 72-hour notices \n16  titled โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ to unhoused community members who were staying in \n17  areas of Bidwell Park called โAnnieโs Glennโ and โHorseshoe Pits.โ Police issued notices to \n18  approximately 50 people that day.  \n19  57.  The โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cites to the Municipal Code Chapter that \n20  contains both the citywide anti-camping and property storage ordinances (CMC ยง 9.20.010 et \n21  seq.), the Park anti-camping ordinance and regulation (CMC ยงยง 12R.18.340, 12.18.430), the \n22  waterway ordinance (CMC ยง 9.50.030), and Penal Code section 647(e).  It threatens recipients \n23  that โ[v]iolations may result in a citation or arrest.โ \n24  58.  The Illegal Encampment Notification also states what will happen to property: \n25  โFailure to remove your property will result in removal by the City of Chico personnel. Any \n26  property that is valued over $100 and all other personal property of reasonable value will be \n27 \n                                                           \n1 This disposition description does not include cases where people left of their own \n28  volition, because the records included a separate category, โgone on arrivalโ. \n  11   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 12 of 31\n \n \n \n1  delivered to the Police Department.โ The notice then provides a phone number to call to retrieve \n \n2  property and says property not retrieved within 90 days will be disposed of.  \n3  59.  The Illegal Encampment Notification asks โDo you need assistance complying \n4  with this order?โ It instructs the recipient to contact the Chico Police Department TARGET Team \n5  at (530) 897-4942.  Upon receiving the notices in January, a number of people staying at Annieโs \n6  Glenn and Horseshoe Pits, called and left messages at the phone number listed for the TARGET \n7  team. The TARGET Team did not answer the phone and did not return the messages. \n8  60.  On January 11, 2021, the Chico Police Department arrived at Bidwell Park to \n9  enforce the notices. Unhoused community members were told they may be cited or arrested if \n10  they did not leave. Over the course of the next few days, the area was cleared of people and their \n11  belongings. Employees from the Public Works Department arrived with a back hoe and dump \n12  truck and collected as waste whatever items unhoused people could not carry with them. The city \n13  threw away tents, tarps, clothing, bedding, and other personal property. \n14  61.  Beginning January 7, 2021, the City of Chico issued the 72-hour notices that \n15  threaten citation and arrest to at least 100 unhoused community members in at least nine (9) \n16  different locations. Each of these 72-hour notices cites the citywide anti-camping ordinance \n17  (Chico Municipal Code ยง 9.20.010 et seq.) and the park and greenway specific anti-camping \n18  ordinance, Chico Municipal Code ยง 12.18.430. \n19  62.  When the Police TARGET Team was serving the notices, they told unhoused \n20  community members that they would have to remove their property from the encampment by the \n21  expiration of the notice and could not sleep in the park anymore after the parkโs closing hours. \n22  The police TARGET team said if they did not comply, they would be subject to citation and \n23  arrest, and their property would be thrown away. \n24  63.  The officers providing and enforcing the 72-hour warning notices did not provide \n25  any information beyond what was listed in the notice itself, other than to offer bus tickets to leave \n26  Chico. The city has not provided any specific locations where unsheltered people can sleep, sit, \n27  and rest without being subject to citation or arrest. When asked where people can legally sleep in \n28  Chico when there is no shelter available, the response from the City of Chico and the police \n  12   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 13 of 31\n \n \n \n1  department has been the same: people may sleep on a public right-of-way with basic necessities, a \n \n2  sleeping bag and pillow, but no tents or structures. The alleged acceptable place on a right-of-way \n3  is a sidewalk space that does not block entrances, driveways, pedestrian traffic, or vehicle traffic. \n4  Plaintiffs allege based on information and belief that there are no such locations in Chico \n5  sufficient for all people who are involuntarily unsheltered. Further, unhoused community \n6  members who have previously slept in locations to which they were directed by the police were \n7  later threatened with a citation or arrest if they did not leave those locations.  \n8  64.  The city has issued and enforced the Illegal Encampment Notifications to \n9  unhoused community members on a vacant city-owned residential lot on Boucher Street, on a \n10  large grass traffic median referred to as the โTriangle,โ in parks, and near waterways. In other \n11  words, the city is methodically enforcing its ordinance throughout the city.  \n12  65.  Police gave at least one unhoused community member a criminal citation for a \n13  misdemeanor when he did not remove his belongings from Bidwell Park after receiving a 72-hour \n14  notice in February 2021.  \n15  66.  City leaders have made clear that the police will continue to threaten to cite and \n16  arrest and will follow through on that threat. On January 12, 2021, City of Chico Police Chief \n17  Matt Madden speaking about the Illegal Encampment Notifications stated, โAs we continue to \n18  enforce this law, we hope that we continue to see compliance. If people still refuse to leave after \n19  the 72 hours and have been given the opportunity to do so, we will enforce this law with citations. \n20  This law is a misdemeanor, so physical arrest is also possible.\" \n21  67.  The cityโs intent is to force its unhoused community members out of Chico. City \n22  Councilmember Sean Morgan stated in a radio interview on February 5, 2021:  \n23  \"The police department's going to keep moving them. And they're going to keep moving \n24  them. And the stragglers that just came to Chico, which is the great majority of them, \n25  because it was convenient and it was easy, and they heard somewhere 'I can get needles \n26  and drugs, healthcare, and free camping,' they're gonna go somewhere else. And those are \n27  people that we can't help. Now is there going to be a little pain while that's happening? \n28 \n  13   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v.

Despite Councilmember Sean Morganโs claims, the 2019 Point In Time Survey \n3  shows that the vast majority of unhoused community members have lived in Butte County for \n4  years. More than 75 percent of people reported they lived in Butte County when they became \n5  homeless.  \n6  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNHOUSED RESIDENTS OF CHICO AT RISK FOR CITATION OR \n7  ARREST FOR SLEEPING OUTSIDE \n8  Plaintiff Bobby Warren \n9  69.

Mr. Warrenโs essential personal items have been taken by the police many times \n3  during his four years sleeping outside in Chico. Police have taken, among other items, his \n4  medication, food, and sleeping bag.  \n5  77.  In 2020, Mr. Warren was repeatedly told by Chico Police he could stay with his \n6  belongings in certain areas and then later told he must move from those areas.  \n7  78.  In late 2020, Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay at One Mile Recreation \n8  Area in Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police then told him to go to the corner of Woodland Avenue \n9  and East Fourth Street, near Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay \n10  there because it was not considered part of the park. However, on January 7, 2021 Mr. Warren \n11  received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification for being in this area, where the police \n12  previously told him to go.  \n13  79.  The Illegal Encampment Notification stated โ[v]iolations may result in citation or \n14  arrest.โ  \n15  80.  Mr. Warren is still sleeping outside.  \n16  81.  Mr. Warren cannot stay in a congregate shelter because he has cancer, which puts \n17  him at high risk for death or serious illness if he contracts COVID-19.  \n18  82.  Mr. Warren cannot sleep on a sidewalk or right of away because he is especially \n19  vulnerable to the elements when compared to a person who does not have disabilities. He would \n20  be very anxious about his safety due to being vulnerable to people passing by who may harm him \n21  because he is homeless on the sidewalk. It would be nearly debilitating due to his anxiety \n22  disorder. \n23  83.  Mr. Warren is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n24  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n25  Plaintiff Andy Lambach  \n26  84.  Plaintiff Andy Lambach and his wife Natalie Lambach lived in Paradise, \n27  California for 6 years. On November 8, 2018 they lost their home in the Camp Fire. \n28  85.  After the fire, Mr. Lambach and his wife came to Chico to stay at the Red Cross \n  15   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 16 of 31\n \n \n \n1  shelter for fire survivors. The shelter closed in January 2019, and Mr. Lambach and his wife have \n \n2  been living outdoors in Chico since then.  \n3  86.  Mr. Lambach has no income and survives solely on CalFresh benefits, which \n4  provide a monthly allowance to buy food. He cannot afford to pay for housing.  \n5  87.  Mr. Lambach has congestive heart failure, an injured shoulder that only has 30 \n6  percent use, and a pinched sciatic nerve.  \n7  88.  Mr. Lambach and his wife have a dog, โZeusโ. \n8  89.  Since becoming homeless in Chico, Mr. Lambach has slept at three different \n9  locations. He has been told by the Chico police to leave locations, and has lost personal \n10  belongings that he was not able to carry away with him.   \n11  90.  In one instance, Mr. Lambach and his wife were sleeping on the south side of \n12  Comanche Creek in Chico. One day he and his wife left the area and came back to find their \n13  belongings gone. Mr. Lambach learned from other people sleeping in the area that the Chico \n14  Police had come to area and went tent to tent. If there was a tent without anyone there, the police \n15  threw that tent and the items in it away. Mr. Lambach did not receive any notice that this was \n16  going to happen and police did not leave a notice telling him how to retrieve his belongings.  \n17  91.  In August 2020, when Mr. Lambach was still sleeping on the south side of \n18  Comanche Creek, he received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification. The notice told him he \n19  was at risk for citation or arrest if he did not remove his belongings from the area.  \n20  92.  When the police came to enforce the notice, the Chico police told Mr. Lambach \n21  and other unhoused residents sleeping in the area that if they did not leave and take their \n22  belongings they would be arrested and their belongings would be thrown away.  \n23  93.  A park ranger told Mr. Lambach and others sleeping in the area that they could go \n24  to the north side of Comanche Creek and would be left alone as long as they stayed at least 50 \n25  feet from the creek.  \n26  94.  However, on April 8, 2021 Mr. Lambach received a 72-hour notice threatening \n27  citation or arrest if he does not leave the area police previously directed him to.  \n28  95.  Mr. Lambach cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to the pain it will cause because of \n  16   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 17 of 31\n \n \n \n1  his injured shoulder and pinched sciatic nerve.  \n \n2  96.  Due to his congestive heart failure, he is in a high risk group for becoming \n3  seriously ill if he contracts COVID-19, and is therefore at risk for serious illness or death if he \n4  were to stay at a congregate shelter.  \n5  97.  Mr. Lambach is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n6  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n7  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson \n8  98.  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson has been a resident of Chico, California for 6 years. \n9  Ms. Thompson had a rent-to-own contract for a house, and then discovered the person she paid \n10  rent to was not the legal owner. She was then physically removed from the home and became \n11  homeless.  \n12  99.  Ms. Thompson has multiple physical disabilities.  She has a condition that makes \n13  it difficult to feel and close her hand, an injured hip, an injured back, and weak lungs due to a \n14  having contracted pneumonia in the past. \n15  100.  Ms. Thompson also has depression. She has dogs to cope with her depression.  \n16  101.  Ms. Thompson has no stable source of income and cannot afford to pay for \n17  housing.  \n18  102.  When she first became homeless, Ms. Thompson moved back and forth between \n19  sleeping in the bike path between Guill Street and near the 20th Street Community Park in Chico \n20  and sleeping in the park itself. The Chico police repeatedly told Ms. Thompson she had to leave \n21  these locations.  \n22  103.  After six months of moving back and forth on 20th Street, Ms. Thompson slept at \n23  the Lindo Channel for about 2 to 3 months until the police told her that in a week they would be \n24  giving camping citations to anyone who was still in Lindo Channel. Fearing a citation, she left the \n25  Lindo Channel. \n26  104.  Ms. Thompson then slept in One Mile Recreation Area in Bidwell Park. She \n27  would remain in one location in the park until the police would tell her to move. She would then \n28  move to another location until the police told her to move again. Eventually, Ms. Thompson \n  17   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 18 of 31\n \n \n \n1  moved out of Bidwell Park due to the Chico police constantly telling her to move but not telling \n \n2  her where she could go. \n3  105.  Ms. Thompson then slept at various locations in Chico. She eventually left each \n4  place because the police told her she had to remove her belongings and leave.  \n5  106.  Ms. Thompson was cited and convicted of infractions in 2017 and again in 2018 \n6  camping outside on public land. The 2017 conviction was for violating the Chico regulation \n7  against camping in a city park, while the 2018 conviction was for violating the Chico ordinance \n8  against camping near a waterway. She received a $483 fine in each case. \n9  107.  Ms. Thompson has lost personal belongings that she could not carry away when \n10  forced to leave locations by the police.  \n11  108.  During one encounter with the Chico police, a police officer told Ms. Thompson \n12  that he is not saying that she should not be homeless, but that she should not be homeless in \n13  Chico. \n14  109.  On August 10, 2020, when Ms. Thompson was sleeping on the south side of \n15  Comanche Creek, Officer Sandoval of the Chico Police Department told Ms. Thompson and \n16  others at the creek to move to the north side of the creek. Officer Sandoval told Ms. Thompson \n17  that she needed to move to the northside by the morning of August 12, 2020. Officer Sandoval \n18  said that if was not out by August 12, then the Chico Police Department would take care of it and \n19  take all of her belongings. \n20  110.  On April 8, 2021 Ms. Thompson received a 72-hour notice threatening citation or \n21  arrest if she does not leave the area to which police previously directed her. \n22  111.  The police have not told Ms. Thompson where she can legally and safely move \n23  and sleep.  \n24  112.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep at a congregate shelter because she is at risk for \n25  becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, due to her history of contracting pneumonia.  \n26  113.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to her injured hip and back.  \n27  114.  Ms. Thompson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is \n28  sleeping outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n  18   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 19 of 31\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams \n \n2  115.  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams has been without a home in Chico for 3 years. He \n3  came to Chico to resolve some child support issues he had with the county. When he arrived he \n4  could not find affordable housing. \n5  116.  Mr. Williams has arthritis, no vertebrae on the bottom of his spine, schizophrenia, \n6  manic depression, and bipolar disorder. \n7  117.  Mr. Williams has a dog, โGeorgiaโ that helps him cope with his mental \n8  disabilities. \n9  118.  When Mr. Williams first started sleeping on the streets the police would tell him to \n10  move or they would arrest or cite him. \n11  119.  In March or April 2020 he began to stay on the southside of Comanche Creek. \n12  During his stay there the police told him that he needed to move he would be arrested or cited. \n13  Mr. Williams moved to another area along the southside of the creek. \n14  120.  A few months later around August 2020, the Chico Police Department gave \n15  everyone on the southside of the creek notices to vacate. They recommended that they move to \n16  the northside of the creek. Mr. Williams moved to the northside of the creek but left after about \n17  two weeks because it was so crowded there. \n18  121.  Mr. Williams then stayed at One Mile Park until late February or early March, \n19  2021 when the Chico Police Department gave the people staying there 72-hour notices to vacate. \n20  The police told Mr. Williams that he could move to a public space if he did not block a right of \n21  way. \n22  122.  Mr. Williams then moved to bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n23  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. However, the police have \n24  told him he will need to move again.  \n25  123.  Mr. Williams cannot stay in congregate housing because his mental disabilities \n26  require that he stay with his dog, and he does not know if he can bring the dog into these shelters. \n27  His disabilities also make him increasingly stressed and claustrophobic when in shelters that have \n28  strict rules and policies. \n  19   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 20 of 31\n \n \n \n1  124.  Mr. Williams cannot sleep on the sidewalk due to the missing vertebrae in his \n \n2  lower back. \n3  125.  Mr. Williams is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n4  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n5  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson \n6  126.  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson is 62 years old and has been a resident of Chico since \n7  1961. He last had stable housing about 8 years ago when the person he cared for as a live-in \n8  caretaker passed away.  \n9  127.  Since Mr. Samuelson lost his housing he has received citations for camping 7 \n10  times in Chico. Five of these citations were in 2013 under City of Chico municipal code section \n11  12R.04.340. One citation was in 2018 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.20.030. One \n12  citation was in 2019 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.50.030C. \n13  128.  Mr. Samuelson estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n14  him and take his belongings approximately 20 times. \n15  129.  In the spring of 2020, Mr. Samuelson began to sleep at One Mile Park. In January \n16  2021 he was given a 72-hour notice to vacate. He was told that if he was not gone in 72 hours \n17  then the police would take his belongings, charge him with a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. \n18  Samuelson asked where he could move and he was told any public right of way where he was not \n19  blocking access. \n20  130.  Mr. Samuelson then moved northwest of Highway 99 in Bidwell Park. He stayed \n21  there until the police gave him another 72-hour notice on February 22, 2021. The police again \n22  told him that if he was not gone in 72 hours then they would take his belongings, charge him with \n23  a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. Samuelson asked where he could move and was again told \n24  any public right of way where he was not blocking access. The police said that a bike path would \n25  be fine if he was not blocking it. \n26  131.  Mr. Samuelson then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th \n27  Street Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. He placed all of his \n28  belongings to the side of the path so that he would not block access. \n  20   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 21 of 31\n \n \n \n1  132.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n \n2  Mr. Samuelson to expect notices to vacate soon. \n3  133.  Mr. Samuelson cannot go into the Torres Shelter because he fears contracting \n4  COVID-19 in such a confined and populated space. He fears that, due to his age, he is more \n5  vulnerable to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer serious harm, or death, if he contracts the \n6  virus. \n7  134.  Mr. Samuelson has tried to sleep on the sidewalk in the past but the Chico Police \n8  Department told him to move. \n9  135.  Mr. Samuelson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n10  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n11  Plaintiff Tracy Miller \n12  136.  Plaintiff Tracy Miller is 58 years old and has been unhoused for 2 years because he \n13  is unable to afford any housing on his very limited income. \n14  137.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Miller stayed in the Safe Space Winter \n15  Shelter until it closed.  \n16  138.  He then began sleeping outdoors near the Jesus Center where he received food and \n17  mail services, and then at the Triangle until February 2021 when he received a 72-hour notice that \n18  he had to leave and take his property. He complied with the notice to avoid arrest and moved to \n19  vacant, city-owned land at Boucher Street between Wisconsin Street and Little Chico Creek.  \n20  139.  At the Boucher Street location, Mr. Miller and others sleeping there were verbally \n21  harassed by neighbors and in mid-February 2021 he received a 72-hour notice that police \n22  enforced on February 16, 2021, telling Mr. Miller they would throw away any property he left \n23  behind. \n24  140.  Mr. Miller took his belongings and went to Humboldt/Windchime Park, but again \n25  he received a 72-hour notice from the Chico Police Department to leave and take all his \n26  belongings. He left the park when police came to enforce the notices on April 1, 2021 to avoid \n27  being arrested.  \n28  141.  Mr. Miller has a dog and believes the local shelter will not allow him in with his \n  21   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 22 of 31\n \n \n \n1  dog.  \n \n2  142.  Mr. Miller is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n3  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n4  Plaintiff Tona Petersen \n5  143.  Plaintiff Tona Petersen is 55 years old and has been unhoused since she lost her \n6  home in the town of Paradise in the 2018 Camp Fire. \n7  144.  Immediately after the Camp Fire, Ms. Petersen evacuated to Oroville with her \n8  fiancรฉe, but due to her fiancรฉeโs violence she soon entered the Catalyst confidential shelter for \n9  domestic violence survivors where she remained until February 2019.  \n10  145.  As a result of trauma from the Camp Fire and domestic violence, Ms. Petersen has \n11  post-traumatic stress disorder, which causes panic attacks, as well as bipolar disorder and \n12  borderline personality disorder. Ms. Petersen also has a seizure disorder, a history of stroke, a \n13  heart murmur and asthma.  \n14  146.  Ms. Petersen has slept at the Comanche Creek Greenway, an open space that \n15  begins at the intersection of Park Avenue, East Park Avenue and Midway, since she left the \n16  Catalyst shelter in 2019. This location permits her to maintain distance from other people, which \n17  is essential to her controlling her mental health symptoms. \n18  147.  Ms. Petersen is unable to live in a congregate shelter environment because close \n19  interactions with other people trigger severe symptoms related to her significant mental health \n20  conditions.  \n21  148.  Her physical disabilities prevent her from safely sleeping on a sidewalk and make \n22  her particularly susceptible to severe illness should she contract COVID-19 and she sought access \n23  to safe shelter through Project Roomkey and learned she was selected for that program, but that \n24  due to her homelessness the coordinators were unable to locate her to inform her, so she was \n25  returned to that programโs waiting list. \n26  149.  Due to very limited income from unemployment insurance and collecting cans for \n27  recycling, Ms. Petersen is unable to afford rental housing. \n28  150.  Ms. Petersen is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n  22   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 23 of 31\n \n \n \n1  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n \n2  Plaintiff Christa Stevens \n3  151.  Plaintiff Christa Stevens has been without stable housing in Chico for 8 years.  \n4  152.  In the last 8 years Ms. Stevens has received 3 citations based on her inability to \n5  find stable housing. One of these citations was in 2018 for Unlawful Camping under City of \n6  Chico municipal code section 12R.04.340. One of these citations was 2019 for Unlawful Storage \n7  of Personal Property on Any Public Parking Lot or Public Area under City of Chico municipal \n8  code section 9.20.050C. Another citation was in 2019 for staying a park after closure under City \n9  of Chico municipal code section 12R.04.370B(4) \n10  153.  Ms. Stevens estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n11  her or give her a citation approximately 40 times in the last 8 years. \n12  154.  Five years ago, Ms. Stevens was sleeping at Depot Park when the Chico Police \n13  Officer told her and her boyfriend that they had too many belongings. The officer took her three \n14  bags of belongings, threw them into the back of his car and said โnow you gotta find new shit.โ \n15  She never got her belongings back. \n16  155.  In fall 2019 Ms. Stevens began to sleep in the area of Bidwell Park northeast of \n17  Highway 99. On February 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department gave her a 72-hour notice to \n18  vacate. The police told Ms. Stevens that if she was not gone in 72 hours then the police would \n19  take her belongings, charge her with a misdemeanor, and arrest her.  \n20  156.  The police told Ms. Stevens that she could move to a public right of way where \n21  she was not blocking access. The police said a bike path would be fine if she did not block the \n22  path. \n23  157.  Ms. Stevens then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n24  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions.  She placed her belongings \n25  to the side of the path so that she would not be blocking peopleโs access.  \n26  158.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n27  Ms. Stevens to expect notices to vacate soon. \n28  159.  Ms. Stevens cannot stay in the Torres Shelter because she fears contracting \n  23   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 24 of 31\n \n \n \n1  COVID-19 in the confined and populated space. Ms. Stevens also has a dog that helps her cope \n \n2  with her anxiety and makes her feel safe when outside. Ms. Stevens does not believe that she can \n3  safely bring her dog into the Torres Shelter. \n4  160.  Ms. Stevens has tried sleeping on the sidewalk in the past and the Chico Police \n5  Department would tell her to move. \n6  161.  Ms. Stevens is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n7  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n8  IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS TO UNHOUSED PERSONS FORCIBLY \n9  REMOVED FROM ENCAMPMENTS \n10  162.  More than 530,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States in the last \n11  year. More than 56,000 Californians have died of COVID-19.  \n12  163.  In April 2020, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued \n13  โInterim Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for \n14  Homeless Service Providers and Local Officialsโ (CDC Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness).  \n15  164.  This guidance explains that โ[s]ome people who are experiencing unsheltered \n16  homelessness may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to older age or \n17  certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions.โ  \n18  165.  The CDC specifically tells local jurisdiction they should not take action to clear \n19  encampments: โIf individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living \n20  unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing encampments can cause \n21  people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This \n22  increases the potential for infectious disease spread.โ  \n23  166.  The CDC advises local jurisdictions to take the following actions rather than \n24  clearing encampments:  \n25  a.  โEncourage those staying in encampments to set up their tents/sleeping quarters \n26  with at least 12 feet x 12 feet of space per individual.โ \n27  b.  โIf an encampment is not able to provide sufficient space for each person, allow \n28  people to remain where they are but help decompress the encampment by linking \n  24   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-KJM-DMC   Document 1   Filed 04/08/21   Page 25 of 31\n \n \n \n1  those at increased risk for severe illness to individual rooms or safe shelter.โ \n \n2  c.  โWork together with community coalition members to improve sanitation in \n3  encampments.โ \n4  d.  โEnsure nearby restroom facilities have functional water taps, are stocked with \n5  hand hygiene materials (soap, drying materials) and bath tissue, and remain open \n6  to people experiencing homelessness 24 hours per day.โ \n7  e.  โIf toilets or handwashing facilities are not available nearby, assist with providing \n8  access to portable latrines with handwashing facilities for encampments of more \n9  than 10 people. These facilities should be equipped with hand sanitizer (containing \n10  at least 60% alcohol).โ \n11  167.  The CDC Guidance was first issued in April 2020 when the COVID-19 rates if \n12  infection were far less than they are currently in the United States, California, and Butte County.  \n13  168.  The CDC has continued to update and reaffirm its guidance, as recently as March \n14  21, 2021. \n15  169.  The City of Chico is not abiding by the CDC guidance. On December 8, 2020 and \n16  15, 2020, the City Council voted to allow the city police to conducts sweeps of encampments in \n17  the city, knowing these actions violate the CDCโs guidance.  \n18  170.  The city is also forcing unhoused residents to move from one location to another \n19  within the city. The city is also threatening to confiscate unhoused community membersโ essential \n20  items that are needed to help guard against COVID-19, such as tents.  \n21  171.  The cityโs ordinances, and policy and practice of banning tents, puts unhoused \n22  people at higher risk for contracting COVID-19, and increases the risks of bodily harm from \n23  exposure-related conditions like hypothermia during colder and wetter seasons and heat stroke \n24  during warmer, dryer seasons.  \n25  172.  These health risks are especially acute for people with disabilities. The 2019 Point-\n26  In-Time count found that a significant amount of Chicoโs unhoused community members have \n27  physical and/or mental disabilities. Around 47 percent have a chronic health disability, 15 percent \n28  have a developmental disability, 44 percent have a mental health disability, and 39 percent have a \n  25   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n7  fully set forth herein. \n8  174.  The acts and omissions of Defendant, as described herein, violate the \n9  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs to be free from actual or threatened cruel and unusual \n10  punishment and excessive fines. By virtue of their status as homeless people, and due to the  \n11  insufficiency of shelter or housing in the City of Chico, the Plaintiffs have no way to comply with \n12  the laws Defendant enacted and continues to enforce against them. \n13  175.  The City of Chico has a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs who \n14  are involuntarily sleeping overnight from public property, including all parks, waterways, and \n15  city-owned properties. This has the effect of a citywide ban that does not allow for Plaintiffs to \n16  maintain life-sustaining activities that are the unavoidable consequence of being without housing.  \n17  176.  Defendant has a custom, policy, and/or practice of encouraging its officers to \n18  threaten and to cite or arrest homeless people for sleeping or having property in public, which is \n19  unavoidable behavior due to their unhoused status. \n20  177.  There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and the City of Chico concerning \n21  the continued threat of citation and arrest if Plaintiffs remain on public property, in parks, \n22  waterways, and other city-owned properties. The city will continue enforcement throughout the \n23  city and has a history of issuing citations and making arrests in other areas of the city. Plaintiffs \n24  desire a judicial determination of their rights and duties and a declaration as to Defendantโs \n25  constitutional obligations. \n26  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n27  Cruel and Unusual Punishment \n28  (Art. 7, ยง17 California Constitution) \n  26   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n \n2  fully set forth herein. \n3  179.  The acts and omissions of Defendant, as described herein, violate the \n4  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs to be free from actual or threatened cruel and unusual \n5  punishment and excessive fines. By virtue of their status as homeless people, and due to the \n6  insufficiency of shelter or housing in the City of Chico, the Plaintiffs have no way to comply with \n7  the laws Defendant enacted and continues to enforce against them. \n8  180.  The City of Chico has a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs who \n9  are involuntarily sleeping overnight from public property, including all parks, waterways, and \n10  city-owned properties. This has the effect of a citywide ban that does not allow for Plaintiffs to \n11  maintain life-sustaining activities that are the unavoidable consequence of being without housing.  \n12  181.  Defendant has a custom, policy, and/or practice of encouraging its officers to \n13  threaten and to cite or arrest homeless people for sleeping or having property in public, which is \n14  unavoidable behavior due to their unhoused status. \n15  182.  There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and the City of Chico concerning \n16  the continued threat of citation and arrest if Plaintiffs remain on public property, in parks, \n17  waterways, and other city-owned properties. The City has made clear that it will continue \n18  enforcement throughout the city and has a history of issuing citations and making arrests in other \n19  areas of the City. Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights and duties and a \n20  declaration as to Defendantโs constitutional obligations. \n21  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n22  Right to Due Process of Law: State-Created Danger \n23  (Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n24  183.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n25  fully set forth herein. \n26  184.  Defendant has a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs from \n27  encampments and instructing them to sleep on rights-of-way with only a sleeping bag for \n28  protection.

Defendant has a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs from \n4  encampments and instructing them to sleep on rights-of-way with only a sleeping bag for \n5  protection.

Defendant has a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs from \n19  encampments and instructing them to sleep on rights-of-way with only a sleeping bag for \n20  protection. This places Plaintiffs in immediate danger to their health and safety from the COVID-\n21  19 global pandemic, depriving them of their rights to substantive due process guaranteed by \n22  Article 1, section 7 of the California Constitution. \n23  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n24  Unlawful Seizure of Property \n25  (Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n26  189.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n27  fully set forth herein. \n28  190.  Defendant has a policy and practice of permanently seizing, with no opportunity \n  28   \nComplaint (Warren, et al v.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n9  fully set herein. \n10  192.  The City of Chicoโs Anti-Camping Ordinances and, in particular, the lack of a \n11  definition of โcampโ in the section 12.18.430 and the existing definitions of โcampโ and โcamp \n12  facilitiesโ in section 9.20.020, create vague and uncertain requirements that are a denial of due \n13  process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \n14  because they fail to inform Plaintiffs and other members of the public as to what speech or \n15  conduct will subject them to criminal penalties and what forms of speech or conduct will not. \n16  SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n17  Right to Due Process of Law \n18  (Article I, Section 7 of the California Constitution) \n19  193.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n20  fully set herein. \n21  194.  The City of Chicoโs Ordinance and, in particular, the definitions of โcampโ and \n22  โcamp facilitiesโ in section 9.20.020, create vague and uncertain requirements that are a denial of \n23  due process of law, as guaranteed by Article 1, section 7 of the California Constitution, because \n24  they fail to inform Plaintiffs and other members of the public as to what speech or conduct will \n25  subject them to criminal penalties and what forms of speech or conduct will not. \n26  EIGTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n27  Violation of California Civil Code ยง 52.1 \n28  195.

Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 2 of 33\n \n \n \n1   \n \n2  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n3  1.  Acknowledging an unprecedented shortage of emergency shelter and affordable \n4  housing, the City of Chico, located in Butte County declared a shelter crisis in October 2018. Just \n5  one month later, the Camp Fire destroyed nearly 14,000 single-family and multifamily homes in \n6  the county, leaving tens of thousands of people in the county homeless. Less than two years later, \n7  in 2020, another wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes. In 2018, when the City of Chico declared \n8  a shelter emergency, there were nearly 1,000 homeless residents in the entire county, hundreds of \n9  whom were unhoused. Today, more than two years after the Camp Fire, the Housing Authority of \n10  the County of Butte estimates that there are more than six thousand households in Chico and its \n11  neighboring town, Oroville that lack permanent housing and are sleeping in tents, cars, and camp \n12  trailers.  \n13  2.  In 2020, the available shelter beds in the region decreased due to the COVID-19 \n14  pandemic. The only congregate shelter in Chico reduced its capacity to reduce the spread of the \n15  virus. The cityโs temporary winter shelter did not open for most of the winter. At the same time, \n16  there is a zero percent rental housing vacancy rate and rents have increased to unaffordable levels \n17  for Chicoโs lowest income residents.  \n18  3.  In December 2020, fully aware of the housing crisis and hundreds, if not thousands \n19  of unhoused community members without access to indoor shelter, the Chico City Council \n20  adopted an ordinance criminalizing camping and remaining after-hours in city parks and open \n21  spaces. The ordinance increased penalties for these acts from administrative citations to criminal \n22  penalties, which permitted the City to arrest and charge unhoused community members with \n23  misdemeanors for resting or sleeping in areas of the city where they were least likely to obstruct \n24  traffic, disturb commercial activity or increase risk of community spread of COVID-19. \n25  4.  In January 2021, the City and Police Department began aggressive enforcement of \n26  the new ordinance and an older citywide ordinance that bans camping on any public property \n27  within city limits. Law enforcement has methodically, location by location, forced unhoused \n28  residents to leave their resting and sleeping places by threatening criminal citation, arrest, and \n  2   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 3 of 33\n \n \n \n1  seizure of the residentsโ property.   \n \n2  5.  These two anti-camping ordinances are part of a larger scheme of local laws that \n3  impose criminal penalties for homeless people when they sleep, sit, lie down, and rest in public. \n4  The city continued enforcing this web of ordinances, even following the devastating wildfire \n5  disasters and pausing only briefly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. According to public \n6  documents, the city made 120 arrests for violations of the citywide anti-camping ordinance \n7  between 2018 and 2020. Through its recent increased enforcement that started on January 7, \n8  2021, the city has enforced its anti-camping ordinances by threatening more than 100 unsheltered \n9  people with arrest at various locations throughout the city. \n10  6.  Defendants actions against involuntarily homeless individuals violate their right to \n11  be free from cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fees, and to due process of the law \n12  under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Defendants \n13  persistent and aggressive enforcement initiative is taking place as the global COVID-19 pandemic \n14  continues to pose immediate danger to the health and safety all people who are unsheltered, and \n15  to the entire community, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n16  7.  Plaintiffs are all involuntarily unhoused residents of Chico. They are at immediate \n17  risk of being cited, arrested and prosecuted for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting and simply existing \n18  in the City of Chico. Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 42 \n19  U.S.C. section 1983.  \n20  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21  8.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based upon the \n22  violations of Plaintiffsโ rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n23  United States Constitution. Jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. sections 1331 (federal \n24  question jurisdiction) and 1343 (civil rights jurisdiction). Jurisdiction also exists under the \n25  Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง2201(a) and 2202. \n26  9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the related state law claims pursuant \n27  to 28 U.S.C. section 1367(a) because those claims form part of the same case or controversy \n28  under Article III of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffsโ state law claims share all common \n  3   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 5 of 33\n \n \n \n1  20.  Defendant City of Chico Police Department is a department of the City of Chico. \n \n2  The Police Department employees enforce the actions, policies, procedures, practices, and \n3  customs of both the City of Chico and City of Chico Police Department policy makers.  \n4  FACTS \n5  CHICOโS LACK OF ADEQUATE SHELTER \n6  21.  The City of Chico has had an affordable housing crisis that has persisted for \n7  several years. On October 2, 2018, the city declared a shelter crisis based on a finding that a \n8  significant number of persons located within the City are unable to find shelter. \n9  22.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey of people who are homeless in Butte County \n10  reaffirmed the continuation of this crisis. The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey, which is the most \n11  recent survey completed, found that there were 891 unsheltered, 420 sheltered, and 993 people \n12  sheltered with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support in Butte County. About \n13  43.66 percent of those unsheltered in Butte County live in the City of Chico.  \n14  23.  According to the 2019 Point-In-Time Survey, in Chico alone, there are 571 \n15  unsheltered individuals and 293 sheltered individuals, meaning 66 percent of Chicoโs homeless \n16  population is unsheltered. The report estimated that the actual number is higher, โdue to ongoing \n17  challenges in locating homeless individuals, especially those who are displaced and unhoused due \n18  to the Camp Fire.โ \n19  24.  The number of unhoused individuals and families in Butte County increased \n20  dramatically after the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2020 North Complex Fires. The Housing Authority \n21  of the County of Butte estimates that today as many as six to seven thousand households in \n22  Chico, and its neighboring town, Oroville are unhoused and living in tents or trailers. The \n23  Housing Authority also estimates that within these unhoused households there are 500 school-\n24  aged children.  \n25  25.  The 2019 Point-in-Time Survey found that 31 percent of all people experiencing \n26  homelessness in Chico reported losing homes in the Camp Fire. Eighty percent of Camp Fire \n27  survivors experiencing homelessness in Chico are unsheltered โ 38 percent of whom report \n28  sleeping with a friend or family in their house or apartment, 30 percent on the street or sidewalk, \n  5   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 6 of 33\n \n \n \n1  14 percent in the park, 8 percent in an outdoor encampment, 5 percent under a bridge/overpass, \n \n2  and 5 percent โother.โ \n3  26.  About 69 percent of people experiencing homelessness in Chico reported in the \n4  2019 Point-in-Time Survey that they are homeless for financial reasons. \n5  27.  On February 2, 2021, a staff report directed to the Chico City Council stated, \n6  โThere is insufficient capacity to shelter everyone experiencing homelessness in Chico.โ \n7  28.  There are only two emergency shelter providers in Chico. These two shelters do \n8  not have sufficient combined capacity for all people who are unsheltered in Chico, and only have \n9  a combined maximum capacity of 130 โ 135 beds due to COVID-19 virus transmission safety \n10  protocols.  \n11  29.  One of the two shelters is the Torres Community Shelter, a year-round congregate \n12  emergency shelter that is available to unsheltered men and women. It also operates a shelter in \n13  another location for families with children. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Torres Shelter \n14  currently has a reduced capacity of 120 beds.  \n15  30.  Guests of the Torres Shelter sleep in a communal setting and are provided meals.  \n16  The shelter has limited ability to provide accommodations for guests with disabilities or medical \n17  conditions who require a special diet, private space or service animals. For the most part, the \n18  shelter cannot accommodate pets.  \n19  31.  The second shelter, Safe Space Winter Shelter, is a temporary winter shelter. \n20  However, it did not open in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, the shelter \n21  opened a medical referral-only shelter in rotating locations with 10 to 15 beds for unsheltered \n22  individuals, including those discharged from Enloe Hospital or Oroville Hospital or referred by \n23  Project Roomkey. The Safe Space Winter Shelter will end in mid-April 2021. The shelter is \n24  currently full and has a waitlist. It is not generally available to people who are unsheltered. \n25  32.  Project Roomkey provides hotel rooms to unhoused people who are vulnerable to \n26  complications from COVID-19, in accordance with Center for Disease Control (CDC) Guidelines \n27  to provide non-congregate sheltering wherever possible and with state and local shelter-in-place \n28  rules and recommendations. While there remain approximately 79 people in the program, Project \n  6   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 7 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Roomkey is no longer available as an emergency shelter. It is only for people who are currently \n \n2  unsheltered if they have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19. \n3  33.  The City of Chico now has fewer shelter beds than it did in 2018 when it declared \n4  a shelter crisis, despite having more people who are unsheltered.  \n5  34.  When Chico declared a shelter crisis, the rental housing vacancy rate was less than \n6  2 percent. One month later, following the Camp Fire, the vacancy rate dropped to nearly zero as \n7  Chico absorbed more than 18,000 new residents between 2018 and 2020, a 20 percent population \n8  increase. During the same period, however, the city added fewer than 3,900 new housing units, an  \n9  increase of only 1.4 percent.  \n10  35.  The HUD Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom unit in Chico increased from $785 \n11  in 2018 to $894 in 2019 and has remained around $900. Actual median rents are higher.  \n12  36.  Nearly one quarter (23.2 percent) of Chico residents live in poverty. This is more \n13  than double the poverty rate of the California, which is 11.8 percent. Butte County also has a high \n14  poverty rate of 16.1 percent.  \n15  37.  Inexplicably, the city rescinded its shelter crisis declaration on April 6, 2021, \n16  despite having more people who are unhoused and fewer emergency shelter options than when it \n17  declared the crisis in 2018. The cityโs action will result in less pubic money to provide shelter and \n18  housing for unhoused community members.  \n19  CHICOโS POLICY AND PRACTICE OF CRIMINALIZING HOMELESSNESS \n20  Chicoโs Laws Punishing Homelessness \n21  38.  In December 2020, the Chico City Council passed Ordinance 2556 to criminalize \n22  violations of the cityโs park regulations in Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12R.04, including \n23  camping in parks and greenways. At the December 8, 2020 Chico City Council meeting in which \n24  the city adopted Ordinance 2556, city staff and city council members said the proposed ordinance \n25  was needed to give the city the authority to criminally cite, arrest, and initiate misdemeanor \n26  charges for violations of the existing park regulations, which previously only allowed the city to \n27  administer a fine. The council passed Ordinance 2556, creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter \n28  12.18 as an urgency ordinance on December 8, 2020. The council voted to enact Ordinance 2556, \n  7   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 8 of 33\n \n \n \n1  creating Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 as a regular ordinance, on December 15, 2020. \n \n2  39.  Ordinance 2557 applies to thousands of acres of public property in Chico, \n3  including all of the cityโs parks; all city-owned greenways, adjoining all creeks, streams, and \n4  watercourses; and any property purchased by or accepted by the city for use of a park or \n5  playground.  C.M.C. ยง 12.04.010 and 12.18.020(N).  \n6  40.  The land subject to Ordinance 2557 represents nearly all, if not all, of the city-\n7  owned public spaces that are realistically available for people who are unsheltered to \n8  involuntarily sleep and engage in other conduct that is an unavoidable consequence their \n9  unhoused status. The City of Chico spans 27.8 square miles and Bidwell Park alone spans 5.73 \n10  square miles, more than a fifth of the cityโs private and public land.  \n11  41.  Chico Municipal Code Chapter 12.18 states in part: \n12  12.18.430 Camping - Prohibited - Exception - Permit required. \n13  No person or group of persons shall camp overnight or remain or stay overnight within \n14  any city park or playground unlessโฆ the overnight camping or stay is authorized by a \n15  permitโฆ \n16  12.18.450 Closure of parks, greenways and open spaces.  \n17  [I]t is unlawful for any person to be present in any city of Chico or Chico Area Parks and \n18  Recreation District parks, greenways, or open spaces during the hours the parks, \n19  greenways. or open spaces are closed. Unless otherwise posted, closing hours shall be \n20  between the hours of 11 :00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. \n21  42.  Chapter 12.18 does not define โcamp.โ \n22  43.  In addition to Ordinance 2557, the City has multiple ordinances that punish \n23  unhoused people for sleeping, sitting, lying, resting, or simply existing on public property. These \n24  ordinances are all punishable by administrative citation, infraction, or misdemeanor.  \n25  44.  Citywide Camping Prohibition - Chicoโs Municipal Codes 9.20.020 and \n26  9.20.030 prohibits camping on all public property and states in part: \n27  9.20.020 Definitions. \n28  A. โCampโ means to place, pitch or occupy camp facilities; to live temporarily in a camp \n  8   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Any park; \n14  B.  Any street; \n15  C.  Any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved; and \n16  D.  On, near or adjacent to any waterway as defined in Section 9.50.020 of this \n17  code. \n18  46.  Sitting on Sidewalks in Commercial Districts - Chico Municipal Code 9.44.015, \n19  which prohibits sitting on sidewalks in commercial districts, states in part: \n20  A. Prohibition. No person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, curb or street, or \n21  upon a blanket, stool, chair or other object placed upon a public sidewalk, curb or street \n22  which is adjacent to any property zoned or used for commercial uses, . . .โ \n23  47.

Between 2018 and 2020, Chico public records provided by the city to Legal \n20  Services of Northern California pursuant to a public records act request show that the Defendants \n21  made 120 arrests for violations of its citywide anti-camping ordinance, Chico Municipal Code \n22  section 9.20.030. During this same time period, the city issued 21 administrative citations for \n23  violations of section 9.20.030.  \n24  53.  Chico police also have a  policy and practice of enforcing the anti-camping \n25  ordinance as well as the other ordinances that prohibit sleeping, sitting, lying, and resting on \n26  public property by warning people to move and threating citation or arrest if they refuse to move. \n27  Public records provided by the City show that between 2018 and 2020, police resolved 968 \n28  citywide calls for service based on complaints of unlawful camping with the disposition \n  10   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 11 of 33\n \n \n \n1  description, โmoved alongโ.1  \n \n2  54.  For unhoused Chico community members resting or sleeping on sidewalks and \n3  other public areas, it is common to be told to move along by the Chico Police, including being \n4  woken up while sleeping and forced to move immediately. Often, officers recommended that \n5  unhoused people move to alternative locations including, other locations within parks and other \n6  public land where unhoused people have traditionally stayed.  \n7  55.  Defendants also have a policy and practice of removing people sleeping outside \n8  from locations by issuing 48-hour or 72-hour notices that inform unhoused community members \n9  they must remove their belongings and leave the location identified on the notice. These notices, \n10  titled โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cite to specific sections of the city municipal code, \n11  including section 9.20.010 et seq., the citywide anti-camping ordinance, and inform the recipient \n12  โ[v]iolations may result in citation or arrest.โ \n13  Chico Increased Enforcement of Its Anti-Camping Ordinances in January 2021 \n14  56.  In early January 2021, soon after the passage of Ordinance 2556, the city and \n15  Police Deparment increased its enforcement of its anti-camping ordinances. On January 7, 2021, \n16  police issued 72-hour notices titled โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ to unhoused community \n17  members who were staying in areas of Bidwell Park called โAnnieโs Glennโ and โHorseshoe \n18  Pits.โ Police issued notices to approximately 50 people that day.  \n19  57.  The โIllegal Encampment Notificationโ cites to the Municipal Code Chapter that \n20  contains both the citywide anti-camping and property storage ordinances (CMC ยง 9.20.010 et \n21  seq.), the Park anti-camping ordinance and regulation (CMC ยงยง 12R.18.340, 12.18.430), the \n22  waterway ordinance (CMC ยง 9.50.030), and Penal Code section 647(e).  It threatens recipients \n23  that โ[v]iolations may result in a citation or arrest.โ \n24  58.  The Illegal Encampment Notification also states what will happen to property: \n25  โFailure to remove your property will result in removal by the City of Chico personnel. Any \n26  property that is valued over $100 and all other personal property of reasonable value will be \n27 \n                                                           \n1 This disposition description does not include cases where people left of their own \n28  volition, because the records included a separate category, โgone on arrivalโ. \n  11   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 12 of 33\n \n \n \n1  delivered to the Police Department.โ The notice then provides a phone number to call to retrieve \n \n2  property and says property not retrieved within 90 days will be disposed of.  \n3  59.  The Illegal Encampment Notification asks โDo you need assistance complying \n4  with this order?โ It instructs the recipient to contact the Chico Police Department TARGET Team \n5  at (530) 897-4942.  Upon receiving the notices in January, a number of people staying at Annieโs \n6  Glenn and Horseshoe Pits, called and left messages at the phone number listed for the TARGET \n7  team. The TARGET Team did not answer the phone and did not return the messages. \n8  60.  On January 11, 2021, the Chico Police Department arrived at Bidwell Park to \n9  enforce the notices. Unhoused community members were told they may be cited or arrested if \n10  they did not leave. Over the course of the next few days, the area was cleared of people and their \n11  belongings. Employees from the Public Works Department arrived with a back hoe and dump \n12  truck and collected as waste whatever items unhoused people could not carry with them. The city \n13  threw away tents, tarps, clothing, bedding, and other personal property. \n14  61.  Beginning January 7, 2021, the City of Chico and Police Department issued the \n15  72-hour notices that threaten citation and arrest to at least 100 unhoused community members in \n16  at least seven different locations. Each of these 72-hour notices cites the citywide anti-camping \n17  ordinance (Chico Municipal Code ยง 9.20.010 et seq.) and the park and greenway specific anti-\n18  camping ordinance, Chico Municipal Code ยง 12.18.430. \n19  62.  When the Police TARGET Team was serving the notices, they told unhoused \n20  community members that they would have to remove their property from the encampment by the \n21  expiration of the notice and could not sleep in the park anymore after the parkโs closing hours. \n22  The police TARGET team said if they did not comply, they would be subject to citation and \n23  arrest, and their property would be thrown away. \n24  63.  The officers providing and enforcing the 72-hour warning notices did not provide \n25  any information beyond what was listed in the notice itself, other than to offer bus tickets to leave \n26  Chico. The city has not provided any specific locations where unsheltered people can sleep, sit, \n27  and rest without being subject to citation or arrest. When asked where people can legally sleep in \n28  Chico when there is no shelter available, the response from the City of Chico and the police \n  12   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 13 of 33\n \n \n \n1  department has been the same: people may sleep on a public right-of-way with basic necessities, a \n \n2  sleeping bag and pillow, but no tents or structures. The alleged acceptable place on a right-of-way \n3  is a sidewalk space that does not block entrances, driveways, pedestrian traffic, or vehicle traffic. \n4  Plaintiffs allege based on information and belief that there are no such locations in Chico \n5  sufficient for all people who are involuntarily unsheltered. Further, unhoused community \n6  members who have previously slept in locations to which they were directed by the police were \n7  later threatened with a citation or arrest if they did not leave those locations.  \n8  64.  Defendants issued and enforced the Illegal Encampment Notifications to unhoused \n9  community members on a vacant city-owned residential lot on Boucher Street, on a large grass \n10  traffic median referred to as the โTriangle,โ in parks, and near waterways. In other words, the city \n11  is methodically enforcing its ordinance throughout the city.  \n12  65.  Police gave at least one unhoused community member a criminal citation for a \n13  misdemeanor when he did not remove his belongings from Bidwell Park after receiving a 72-hour \n14  notice in February 2021.  \n15  66.  City leaders have made clear that the police will continue to threaten to cite and \n16  arrest and will follow through on that threat. On January 12, 2021, City of Chico Police Chief \n17  Matt Madden speaking about the Illegal Encampment Notifications stated, โAs we continue to \n18  enforce this law, we hope that we continue to see compliance. If people still refuse to leave after \n19  the 72 hours and have been given the opportunity to do so, we will enforce this law with citations. \n20  This law is a misdemeanor, so physical arrest is also possible.\" \n21  67.  The cityโs intent is to force its unhoused community members out of Chico. City \n22  Councilmember Sean Morgan stated in a radio interview on February 5, 2021:  \n23  \"The police department's going to keep moving them. And they're going to keep moving \n24  them. And the stragglers that just came to Chico, which is the great majority of them, \n25  because it was convenient and it was easy, and they heard somewhere 'I can get needles \n26  and drugs, healthcare, and free camping,' they're gonna go somewhere else. And those are \n27  people that we can't help. Now is there going to be a little pain while that's happening? \n28 \n  13   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 14 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Yes, and you're seeing it, and we'll stay on top of it.\"2 \n \n2  68.  Despite Councilmember Sean Morganโs claims, the 2019 Point In Time Survey \n3  shows that the vast majority of unhoused community members have lived in Butte County for \n4  years. More than 75 percent of people reported they lived in Butte County when they became \n5  homeless.  \n6  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNHOUSED RESIDENTS OF CHICO AT RISK FOR CITATION OR \n7  ARREST FOR SLEEPING OUTSIDE \n8  Plaintiff Bobby Warren \n9  69.  Plaintiff Bobby Warren has lived in Chico for about four years.  He became \n10  homeless after he and his spouse divorced and he became ill with cancer.  \n11  70.  Before becoming homeless, Mr. Warren owned a home and ran a business. Right \n12  now, he does not have any income, other than the money he earns from recycling. He was \n13  receiving unemployment insurance, but the benefits recently ended.  \n14  71.  Mr. Warren takes medication for his cancer. He uses the money he earns recycling \n15  for his medicine and must earn $60 a week to cover the costs of his medicine.  He has fatigue and \n16  low energy due to the disease and treatment. Mr. Warren also has generalized anxiety disorder \n17  and depression. \n18  72.  Mr. Warren has slept in various places throughout Chico. During this time, he has \n19  received more than six Illegal Encampment Notifications that said he could be cited or arrested.  \n20  73.  Mr. Warren was cited in 2019 and 2020 for violating the citywide ordinance \n21  against storing personal property on public land. He was cited September 7, 2019, and fined $483 \n22  on December 10, 2019, for having personal property in a public lot or area. He was cited June 7, \n23  2020, and fined $525 on February 2, 2021, for having personal property near a waterway.  \n24  74.  Mr. Warren was cited  and fined $483 on January 2, 2019, and cited again on \n25  March 12, 2019, for camping at or near a waterway. \n26  75.  Mr. Warren was cited twice in 2018 for violating the Chico regulation against \n27  being in a city park after hours. He was cited February 15, 2018, and fined $516 on July 10, 2018 \n                                                           \n28  2\n https://kpay.com/podcasts/morning-show?play_file=100044 \n  14   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 15 of 33\n \n \n \n1  and then cited again May 2, 2018 and fined another $516. \n \n2  76.  Mr. Warrenโs essential personal items have been taken by the police many times \n3  during his four years sleeping outside in Chico. Police have taken, among other items, his \n4  medication, food, and sleeping bag.  \n5  77.  In 2020, Mr. Warren was repeatedly told by Chico Police he could stay with his \n6  belongings in certain areas and then later told he must move from those areas.  \n7  78.  In late 2020, Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay at One Mile Recreation \n8  Area in Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police then told him to go to the corner of Woodland Avenue \n9  and East Fourth Street, near Lower Bidwell Park. Chico Police told Mr. Warren he could stay \n10  there because it was not considered part of the park. However, on January 7, 2021 Mr. Warren \n11  received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification for being in this area, where the police \n12  previously told him to go.  \n13  79.  The Illegal Encampment Notification stated โ[v]iolations may result in citation or \n14  arrest.โ  \n15  80.  Mr. Warren is still sleeping outside.  \n16  81.  Mr. Warren cannot stay in a congregate shelter because he has cancer, which puts \n17  him at high risk for death or serious illness if he contracts COVID-19.  \n18  82.  Mr. Warren cannot sleep on a sidewalk or right of away because he is especially \n19  vulnerable to the elements when compared to a person who does not have disabilities. He would \n20  be very anxious about his safety due to being vulnerable to people passing by who may harm him \n21  because he is homeless on the sidewalk. It would be nearly debilitating due to his anxiety \n22  disorder. \n23  83.  Mr. Warren is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n24  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n25  Plaintiff Andy Lambach  \n26  84.  Plaintiff Andy Lambach and his wife Natalie Lambach lived in Paradise, \n27  California for 6 years. On November 8, 2018 they lost their home in the Camp Fire. \n28  85.  After the fire, Mr. Lambach and his wife came to Chico to stay at the Red Cross \n  15   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 16 of 33\n \n \n \n1  shelter for fire survivors. The shelter closed in January 2019, and Mr. Lambach and his wife have \n \n2  been living outdoors in Chico since then.  \n3  86.  Mr. Lambach has no income and survives solely on CalFresh benefits, which \n4  provide a monthly allowance to buy food. He cannot afford to pay for housing.  \n5  87.  Mr. Lambach has congestive heart failure, an injured shoulder that only has 30 \n6  percent use, and a pinched sciatic nerve.  \n7  88.  Mr. Lambach and his wife have a dog, โZeusโ. \n8  89.  Since becoming homeless in Chico, Mr. Lambach has slept at three different \n9  locations. He has been told by the Chico police to leave locations, and has lost personal \n10  belongings that he was not able to carry away with him.   \n11  90.  In one instance, Mr. Lambach and his wife were sleeping on the south side of \n12  Comanche Creek in Chico. One day he and his wife left the area and came back to find their \n13  belongings gone. Mr. Lambach learned from other people sleeping in the area that the Chico \n14  Police had come to area and went tent to tent. If there was a tent without anyone there, the police \n15  threw that tent and the items in it away. Mr. Lambach did not receive any notice that this was \n16  going to happen and police did not leave a notice telling him how to retrieve his belongings.  \n17  91.  In August 2020, when Mr. Lambach was still sleeping on the south side of \n18  Comanche Creek, he received a 72-hour Illegal Encampment Notification. The notice told him he \n19  was at risk for citation or arrest if he did not remove his belongings from the area.  \n20  92.  When the police came to enforce the notice, the Chico police told Mr. Lambach \n21  and other unhoused residents sleeping in the area that if they did not leave and take their \n22  belongings they would be arrested and their belongings would be thrown away.  \n23  93.  A park ranger told Mr. Lambach and others sleeping in the area that they could go \n24  to the north side of Comanche Creek and would be left alone as long as they stayed at least 50 \n25  feet from the creek.  \n26  94.  However, on April 8, 2021 Mr. Lambach received a 72-hour notice threatening \n27  citation or arrest if he does not leave the area police previously directed him to.  \n28  95.  Mr. Lambach cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to the pain it will cause because of \n  16   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 17 of 33\n \n \n \n1  his injured shoulder and pinched sciatic nerve.  \n \n2  96.  Due to his congestive heart failure, he is in a high risk group for becoming \n3  seriously ill if he contracts COVID-19, and is therefore at risk for serious illness or death if he \n4  were to stay at a congregate shelter.  \n5  97.  Mr. Lambach is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n6  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n7  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson \n8  98.  Plaintiff Carol Beth Thompson has been a resident of Chico, California for 6 years. \n9  Ms. Thompson had a rent-to-own contract for a house, and then discovered the person she paid \n10  rent to was not the legal owner. She was then physically removed from the home and became \n11  homeless.  \n12  99.  Ms. Thompson has multiple physical disabilities.  She has a condition that makes \n13  it difficult to feel and close her hand, an injured hip, an injured back, and weak lungs due to a \n14  having contracted pneumonia in the past. \n15  100.  Ms. Thompson also has depression. She has dogs to cope with her depression.  \n16  101.  Ms. Thompson has no stable source of income and cannot afford to pay for \n17  housing.  \n18  102.  When she first became homeless, Ms. Thompson moved back and forth between \n19  sleeping in the bike path between Guill Street and near the 20th Street Community Park in Chico \n20  and sleeping in the park itself. The Chico police repeatedly told Ms. Thompson she had to leave \n21  these locations.  \n22  103.  After six months of moving back and forth on 20th Street, Ms. Thompson slept at \n23  the Lindo Channel for about 2 to 3 months until the police told her that in a week they would be \n24  giving camping citations to anyone who was still in Lindo Channel. Fearing a citation, she left the \n25  Lindo Channel. \n26  104.  Ms. Thompson then slept in One Mile Recreation Area in Bidwell Park. She \n27  would remain in one location in the park until the police would tell her to move. She would then \n28  move to another location until the police told her to move again. Eventually, Ms. Thompson \n  17   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 18 of 33\n \n \n \n1  moved out of Bidwell Park due to the Chico police constantly telling her to move but not telling \n \n2  her where she could go. \n3  105.  Ms. Thompson then slept at various locations in Chico. She eventually left each \n4  place because the police told her she had to remove her belongings and leave.  \n5  106.  Ms. Thompson was cited and convicted of infractions in 2017 and again in 2018 \n6  camping outside on public land. The 2017 conviction was for violating the Chico regulation \n7  against camping in a city park, while the 2018 conviction was for violating the Chico ordinance \n8  against camping near a waterway. She received a $483 fine in each case. \n9  107.  Ms. Thompson has lost personal belongings that she could not carry away when \n10  forced to leave locations by the police.  \n11  108.  During one encounter with the Chico police, a police officer told Ms. Thompson \n12  that he is not saying that she should not be homeless, but that she should not be homeless in \n13  Chico. \n14  109.  On August 10, 2020, when Ms. Thompson was sleeping on the south side of \n15  Comanche Creek, Officer Sandoval of the Chico Police Department told Ms. Thompson and \n16  others at the creek to move to the north side of the creek. Officer Sandoval told Ms. Thompson \n17  that she needed to move to the northside by the morning of August 12, 2020. Officer Sandoval \n18  said that if was not out by August 12, then the Chico Police Department would take care of it and \n19  take all of her belongings. \n20  110.  On April 8, 2021 Ms. Thompson received a 72-hour notice threatening citation or \n21  arrest if she does not leave the area to which police previously directed her. \n22  111.  The police have not told Ms. Thompson where she can legally and safely move \n23  and sleep.  \n24  112.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep at a congregate shelter because she is at risk for \n25  becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, due to her history of contracting pneumonia.  \n26  113.  Ms. Thompson cannot sleep on a sidewalk due to her injured hip and back.  \n27  114.  Ms. Thompson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is \n28  sleeping outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n  18   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 19 of 33\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams \n \n2  115.  Plaintiff Jonathon Williams has been without a home in Chico for 3 years. He \n3  came to Chico to resolve some child support issues he had with the county. When he arrived he \n4  could not find affordable housing. \n5  116.  Mr. Williams has arthritis, no vertebrae on the bottom of his spine, schizophrenia, \n6  manic depression, and bipolar disorder. \n7  117.  Mr. Williams has a dog, โGeorgiaโ that helps him cope with his mental \n8  disabilities. \n9  118.  When Mr. Williams first started sleeping on the streets the police would tell him to \n10  move or they would arrest or cite him. \n11  119.  In March or April 2020 he began to stay on the southside of Comanche Creek. \n12  During his stay there the police told him that he needed to move he would be arrested or cited. \n13  Mr. Williams moved to another area along the southside of the creek. \n14  120.  A few months later around August 2020, the Chico Police Department gave \n15  everyone on the southside of the creek notices to vacate. They recommended that they move to \n16  the northside of the creek. Mr. Williams moved to the northside of the creek but left after about \n17  two weeks because it was so crowded there. \n18  121.  Mr. Williams then stayed at One Mile Park until late February or early March, \n19  2021 when the Chico Police Department gave the people staying there 72-hour notices to vacate. \n20  The police told Mr. Williams that he could move to a public space if he did not block a right of \n21  way. \n22  122.  Mr. Williams then moved to bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n23  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. However, the police have \n24  told him he will need to move again.  \n25  123.  Mr. Williams cannot stay in congregate housing because his mental disabilities \n26  require that he stay with his dog, and he does not know if he can bring the dog into these shelters. \n27  His disabilities also make him increasingly stressed and claustrophobic when in shelters that have \n28  strict rules and policies. \n  19   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 20 of 33\n \n \n \n1  124.  Mr. Williams cannot sleep on the sidewalk due to the missing vertebrae in his \n \n2  lower back. \n3  125.  Mr. Williams is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n4  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n5  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson \n6  126.  Plaintiff Michael Samuelson is 62 years old and has been a resident of Chico since \n7  1961. He last had stable housing about 8 years ago when the person he cared for as a live-in \n8  caretaker passed away.  \n9  127.  Since Mr. Samuelson lost his housing he has received citations for camping 7 \n10  times in Chico. Five of these citations were in 2013 under City of Chico municipal code section \n11  12R.04.340. One citation was in 2018 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.20.030. One \n12  citation was in 2019 under City of Chico municipal code section 9.50.030C. \n13  128.  Mr. Samuelson estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n14  him and take his belongings approximately 20 times. \n15  129.  In the spring of 2020, Mr. Samuelson began to sleep at One Mile Park. In January \n16  2021 he was given a 72-hour notice to vacate. He was told that if he was not gone in 72 hours \n17  then the police would take his belongings, charge him with a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. \n18  Samuelson asked where he could move and he was told any public right of way where he was not \n19  blocking access. \n20  130.  Mr. Samuelson then moved northwest of Highway 99 in Bidwell Park. He stayed \n21  there until the police gave him another 72-hour notice on February 22, 2021. The police again \n22  told him that if he was not gone in 72 hours then they would take his belongings, charge him with \n23  a misdemeanor, and arrest him. Mr. Samuelson asked where he could move and was again told \n24  any public right of way where he was not blocking access. The police said that a bike path would \n25  be fine if he was not blocking it. \n26  131.  Mr. Samuelson then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th \n27  Street Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions. He placed all of his \n28  belongings to the side of the path so that he would not block access. \n  20   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 21 of 33\n \n \n \n1  132.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n \n2  Mr. Samuelson to expect notices to vacate soon. \n3  133.  Mr. Samuelson cannot go into the Torres Shelter because he fears contracting \n4  COVID-19 in such a confined and populated space. He fears that, due to his age, he is more \n5  vulnerable to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer serious harm, or death, if he contracts the \n6  virus. \n7  134.  Mr. Samuelson has tried to sleep on the sidewalk in the past but the Chico Police \n8  Department told him to move. \n9  135.  Mr. Samuelson is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n10  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n11  Plaintiff Tracy Miller \n12  136.  Plaintiff Tracy Miller is 58 years old and has been unhoused for 2 years because he \n13  is unable to afford any housing on his very limited income. \n14  137.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Miller stayed in the Safe Space Winter \n15  Shelter until it closed.  \n16  138.  He then began sleeping outdoors near the Jesus Center where he received food and \n17  mail services, and then at the Triangle until February 2021 when he received a 72-hour notice that \n18  he had to leave and take his property. He complied with the notice to avoid arrest and moved to \n19  vacant, city-owned land at Boucher Street between Wisconsin Street and Little Chico Creek.  \n20  139.  At the Boucher Street location, Mr. Miller and others sleeping there were verbally \n21  harassed by neighbors and in mid-February 2021 he received a 72-hour notice that police \n22  enforced on February 16, 2021, telling Mr. Miller they would throw away any property he left \n23  behind. \n24  140.  Mr. Miller took his belongings and went to Humboldt/Windchime Park, but again \n25  he received a 72-hour notice from the Chico Police Department to leave and take all his \n26  belongings. He left the park when police came to enforce the notices on April 1, 2021 to avoid \n27  being arrested.  \n28  141.  Mr. Miller has a dog and believes the local shelter will not allow him in with his \n  21   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 22 of 33\n \n \n \n1  dog.  \n \n2  142.  Mr. Miller is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because he is sleeping \n3  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n4  Plaintiff Tona Petersen \n5  143.  Plaintiff Tona Petersen is 55 years old and has been unhoused since she lost her \n6  home in the town of Paradise in the 2018 Camp Fire. \n7  144.  Immediately after the Camp Fire, Ms. Petersen evacuated to Oroville with her \n8  fiancรฉe, but due to her fiancรฉeโs violence she soon entered the Catalyst confidential shelter for \n9  domestic violence survivors where she remained until February 2019.  \n10  145.  As a result of trauma from the Camp Fire and domestic violence, Ms. Petersen has \n11  post-traumatic stress disorder, which causes panic attacks, as well as bipolar disorder and \n12  borderline personality disorder. Ms. Petersen also has a seizure disorder, a history of stroke, a \n13  heart murmur and asthma.  \n14  146.  Ms. Petersen has slept at the Comanche Creek Greenway, an open space that \n15  begins at the intersection of Park Avenue, East Park Avenue and Midway, since she left the \n16  Catalyst shelter in 2019. This location permits her to maintain distance from other people, which \n17  is essential to her controlling her mental health symptoms. \n18  147.  Ms. Petersen is unable to live in a congregate shelter environment because close \n19  interactions with other people trigger severe symptoms related to her significant mental health \n20  conditions.  \n21  148.  Her physical disabilities prevent her from safely sleeping on a sidewalk and make \n22  her particularly susceptible to severe illness should she contract COVID-19 and she sought access \n23  to safe shelter through Project Roomkey and learned she was selected for that program, but that \n24  due to her homelessness the coordinators were unable to locate her to inform her, so she was \n25  returned to that programโs waiting list. \n26  149.  Due to very limited income from unemployment insurance and collecting cans for \n27  recycling, Ms. Petersen is unable to afford rental housing. \n28  150.  Ms. Petersen is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n  22   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 23 of 33\n \n \n \n1  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n \n2  Plaintiff Christa Stevens \n3  151.  Plaintiff Christa Stevens has been without stable housing in Chico for 8 years.  \n4  152.  In the last 8 years Ms. Stevens has received 3 citations based on her inability to \n5  find stable housing. One of these citations was in 2018 for Unlawful Camping under City of \n6  Chico municipal code section 12R.04.340. One of these citations was 2019 for Unlawful Storage \n7  of Personal Property on Any Public Parking Lot or Public Area under City of Chico municipal \n8  code section 9.20.050C. Another citation was in 2019 for staying a park after closure under City \n9  of Chico municipal code section 12R.04.370B(4) \n10  153.  Ms. Stevens estimates that the Chico Police Department has threatened to arrest \n11  her or give her a citation approximately 40 times in the last 8 years. \n12  154.  Five years ago, Ms. Stevens was sleeping at Depot Park when the Chico Police \n13  Officer told her and her boyfriend that they had too many belongings. The officer took her three \n14  bags of belongings, threw them into the back of his car and said โnow you gotta find new shit.โ \n15  She never got her belongings back. \n16  155.  In fall 2019 Ms. Stevens began to sleep in the area of Bidwell Park northeast of \n17  Highway 99. On February 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department gave her a 72-hour notice to \n18  vacate. The police told Ms. Stevens that if she was not gone in 72 hours then the police would \n19  take her belongings, charge her with a misdemeanor, and arrest her.  \n20  156.  The police told Ms. Stevens that she could move to a public right of way where \n21  she was not blocking access. The police said a bike path would be fine if she did not block the \n22  path. \n23  157.  Ms. Stevens then moved to the bike path between Guill Street and the 20th Street \n24  Community Park believing this complied with the policeโs directions.  She placed her belongings \n25  to the side of the path so that she would not be blocking peopleโs access.  \n26  158.  On March 22, 2021 the Chico Police Department came to the bike path and told \n27  Ms. Stevens to expect notices to vacate soon. \n28  159.  Ms. Stevens cannot stay in the Torres Shelter because she fears contracting \n  23   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 24 of 33\n \n \n \n1  COVID-19 in the confined and populated space. Ms. Stevens also has a dog that helps her cope \n \n2  with her anxiety and makes her feel safe when outside. Ms. Stevens does not believe that she can \n3  safely bring her dog into the Torres Shelter. \n4  160.  Ms. Stevens has tried sleeping on the sidewalk in the past and the Chico Police \n5  Department would tell her to move. \n6  161.  Ms. Stevens is subject to arrest, citation, and prosecution because she is sleeping \n7  outdoors and has nowhere to go.  \n8  IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS TO UNHOUSED PERSONS FORCIBLY \n9  REMOVED FROM ENCAMPMENTS \n10  162.  More than 530,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States in the last \n11  year. More than 56,000 Californians have died of COVID-19.  \n12  163.  In April 2020, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued \n13  โInterim Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for \n14  Homeless Service Providers and Local Officialsโ (CDC Guidance on Unsheltered Homelessness).  \n15  164.  This guidance explains that โ[s]ome people who are experiencing unsheltered \n16  homelessness may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to older age or \n17  certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or serious heart conditions.โ  \n18  165.  The CDC specifically tells local jurisdiction they should not take action to clear \n19  encampments: โIf individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living \n20  unsheltered or in encampments to remain where they are. Clearing encampments can cause \n21  people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This \n22  increases the potential for infectious disease spread.โ  \n23  166.  The CDC advises local jurisdictions to take the following actions rather than \n24  clearing encampments:  \n25  a.  โEncourage those staying in encampments to set up their tents/sleeping quarters \n26  with at least 12 feet x 12 feet of space per individual.โ \n27  b.  โIf an encampment is not able to provide sufficient space for each person, allow \n28  people to remain where they are but help decompress the encampment by linking \n  24   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 25 of 33\n \n \n \n1  those at increased risk for severe illness to individual rooms or safe shelter.โ \n \n2  c.  โWork together with community coalition members to improve sanitation in \n3  encampments.โ \n4  d.  โEnsure nearby restroom facilities have functional water taps, are stocked with \n5  hand hygiene materials (soap, drying materials) and bath tissue, and remain open \n6  to people experiencing homelessness 24 hours per day.โ \n7  e.  โIf toilets or handwashing facilities are not available nearby, assist with providing \n8  access to portable latrines with handwashing facilities for encampments of more \n9  than 10 people. These facilities should be equipped with hand sanitizer (containing \n10  at least 60% alcohol).โ \n11  167.  The CDC Guidance was first issued in April 2020 when the COVID-19 rates if \n12  infection were far less than they are currently in the United States, California, and Butte County.  \n13  168.  The CDC has continued to update and reaffirm its guidance, as recently as March \n14  21, 2021. \n15  169.  The City of Chico is not abiding by the CDC guidance. On December 8, 2020 and \n16  15, 2020, the City Council voted to allow the city police to conducts sweeps of encampments in \n17  the city, knowing these actions violate the CDCโs guidance.  \n18  170.  The city is also forcing unhoused residents to move from one location to another \n19  within the city. The city is also threatening to confiscate unhoused community membersโ essential \n20  items that are needed to help guard against COVID-19, such as tents.  \n21  171.  The cityโs ordinances, and policy and practice of banning tents, puts unhoused \n22  people at higher risk for contracting COVID-19, and increases the risks of bodily harm from \n23  exposure-related conditions like hypothermia during colder and wetter seasons and heat stroke \n24  during warmer, dryer seasons.  \n25  172.  These health risks are especially acute for people with disabilities. The 2019 Point-\n26  In-Time count found that a significant amount of Chicoโs unhoused community members have \n27  physical and/or mental disabilities. Around 47 percent have a chronic health disability, 15 percent \n28  have a developmental disability, 44 percent have a mental health disability, and 39 percent have a \n  25   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v. Chico)  \n  \n\n \nCase 2:21-cv-00640-MCE-DMC   Document 34   Filed 04/11/21   Page 26 of 33\n \n \n \n1  physical disability. \n \n2  LEGAL BACKGROUND \n3  173.  At all relevant times, Defendants and their agents acted under color of state law \n4  and within the scope of their employment.  \n5  174.  Defendants' actions and conduct have resulted and will result in irreparable injury \n6  to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law to address the wrongs \n7  described herein. Defendants have made it clear by their previous and ongoing actions that they \n8  intend to continue the unlawful conduct described above.  Defendants have a policy and practice \n9  of  (1) confiscating and destroying the personal property of individual Plaintiffs and similarly \n10  situated homeless individuals without legal basis; and (2) criminalizing individual Plaintiffsโ \n11  ability to rest and perform other unavoidable acts of survival in public places. Defendants have \n12  and will continue to participate in implementing this policy and practice unless and until \n13  restrained by an injunctive decree of this Court. \n14  175.  The acts of Defendants as alleged above constituted violations of individual \n15  Plaintiffsโ established constitutional rights. Defendants knew or should have known that their \n16  conduct in seizing and destroying individual Plaintiffs' personal property  that Defendants \n17  determined was valued as less than $100 or not of reasonable value was inconsistent with \n18  individual Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, and they knew or should have known that citing, \n19  arresting, and issuing notices threatening criminal prosecution for the Chico Municipal \n20  Ordinances discussed herein violates the Eighth Amendment. \n21  176.  An actual controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants because \n22  Defendants have engaged in the unlawful and unconstitutional conduct as alleged and intend to \n23  continue this unlawful conduct as an ongoing practice and policy of Defendants. Plaintiffs seek a \n24  declaration that the prosecution and threat of prosecution and imposition of criminal penalties for \n25  involuntary conduct associated with being homeless and the seizure and destruction of personal \n26  property without proper notices, warrants, or hearing rights is unlawful and unconstitutional. \n27  177.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ unconstitutional and unlawful \n28  policies, practices and conduct, individual Plaintiffs have suffered, and will continue to suffer \n  26   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Plaintiffs incorporate each and every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if \n12  fully set forth herein. \n13  179.  The acts and omissions of Defendants, as described herein, violate the \n14  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs to be free from actual or threatened cruel and unusual \n15  punishment and excessive fines.

The City of Chico  and City of Chico Police Department have a policy and practice \n19  of forcibly removing Plaintiffs who are involuntarily sleeping overnight from public property, \n20  including all parks, waterways, and city-owned properties. This has the effect of a citywide ban \n21  that does not allow for Plaintiffs to maintain life-sustaining activities that are the unavoidable \n22  consequence of being without housing.  \n23  181.  Defendants have a custom, policy, and/or practice of encouraging its officers to \n24  threaten and to cite or arrest homeless people for sleeping or having property in public, which is \n25  unavoidable behavior due to their unhoused status. \n26  182.  There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendants concerning the \n27  continued threat of citation and arrest if Plaintiffs remain on public property, in parks, waterways, \n28  and other city-owned properties. Defendants will continue enforcement throughout the city and \n  27   \nFirst Amended Complaint (Warren, et al v.

Defendants have a policy and practice of forcibly removing Plaintiffs who are \n15  involuntarily sleeping overnight from public property, including all parks, waterways, and city-\n16  owned properties. This has the effect of a citywide ban that does not allow for Plaintiffs to \n17  maintain life-sustaining activities that are the unavoidable consequence of being without housing.  \n18  186.  Defendants have a custom, policy, and/or practice of encouraging its officers to \n19  threaten and to cite or arrest homeless people for sleeping or having property in public, which is \n20  unavoidable behavior due to their unhoused status. \n21  187.
