Sean F. Cox \nD-14 Raymond Adams, \nDefendant/Petitioner.\n____________________________/\nOPINION & ORDER \nDENYING § 2255 MOTION (Doc. # 417), DENYING MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT\nOF COUNSEL (Doc. # 388), AND DECLINING TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF\nAPPEALABILITY \nIn Criminal Case Number 12-20218, Petitioner Raymond Adams (“Petitioner”) pleaded\nguilty, pursuant to a Rule 11 Plea Agreement, to one count of Robbery Affecting Interstate\nCommerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 and one count of Using or Carrying a Firearm\nDuring a Federal Crime of Violence; Aiding and Abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). \n(Doc. # 374, Rule 11 Plea Agreement).  This Court sentenced Petitioner to a total term of 90\nmonths.  (Doc. # 387).  \nThe matter is now before the Court on Petitioner’s pro se letter, construed by the Court as\na Motion to Vacate Sentence brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.  (Doc. # 417, Pet. Br.). \nPetitioner’s request for relief is based upon the Supreme Court’s decisions in Rosemond v.\nUnited States, 135 S. Ct. 1240 (2014), which clarified what is necessary to aid and abet a\nviolation of § 924(c) and Johnson v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 2251 (2015), which held that the\nresidual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”) was unconstitutionally vague.  The\n1\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 2 of 8    Pg ID 3840\nGovernment has filed a response opposing Petitioner’s motion.  (Doc. # 409, Gov’t Resp.). \nPetitioner has not filed a reply to the Government’s response and time to do so has passed.  \nBecause the files and records of the case conclusively establish that Petitioner is not\nentitled to relief as to any of the claims set forth in this § 2255 motion, an evidentiary hearing is\nnot necessary.  The motion is therefore ready for a decision by this Court.  For the reasons set\nforth below, Petitioner’s motion to vacate will be DENIED and Petitioner’s motion for\nappointment of counsel is DENIED AS MOOT.  Moreover, the Court declines to issue a\ncertificate of appealability.  \nBACKGROUND \nOn December 10 2014, Petitioner pleaded guilty, pursuant to a Rule 11 Plea Agreement,\n“to Counts One and Two of the Sixth Superseding Indictment, which charge Robbery Affecting\nInterstate Commerce and Using or Carrying a Firearm During and in Relation to a Federal Crime\nof Violence.”  (Rule 11 Plea Agreement, at ¶ 1A). \nThis Court sentenced Petitioner to 6 months on Count 1 and to 84 months on Count 2, to\nrun consecutively with the sentenced imposed on Count 1.  (Doc. # 387).  Petitioner did not file a\ndirect appeal. \nJanuary 25, 2016, Petitioner filed a pro se letter, titled “Motion to be Appointed\nCounsel.”  (Doc. # 388).  Petitioner requested counsel in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in\nJohnson v. United States.  On May 19, 2016, Petitioner filed a second pro se letter, which the\nCourt has construed as a Motion to Vacate Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.  (Doc. # 417). \nIn it, Petitioner asserts that his § 924(c) aiding and abetting conviction must be vacated in light\nof Rosemond v. United States and Johnson v. United States.  The Government filed a brief in\n2\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 3 of 8    Pg ID 3841\nopposition to the motion on September 29, 2016.  (Doc. # 409).  \nSTANDARD \nPetitioner’s motion is brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which provides: \nA prisoner in custody under a sentence of a court established by Act of Congress\nclaiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence imposed was\nin violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was\nwithout jurisdiction to impose such a sentence, or that the sentence was in excess\nof the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack,\nmay move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct\nthe sentence.\n28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).  To prevail on a § 2255 motion, “a petitioner must demonstrate the\nexistence of an error of constitutional magnitude which has a substantial and injurious effect or\ninfluence on the guilty plea or the jury’s verdict.”  Humphress v. United States, 398 F.3d 855,\n858 (6th Cir. 2005).  A movant can prevail on a § 2255 motion alleging non-constitutional error\nonly by establishing a “fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of\njustice, or an error so egregious that it amounts to a violation of due process.”  Watson v. United\nStates, 165 F.3d 486, 488 (6th Cir. 1999).  \nThe Court must hold an evidentiary hearing on a § 2255 motion “[u]nless the motion and\nthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief . . . .” \n28 U.S.C. § 2255(b); Blanton v. United States, 94 F.3d 227, 235 (6th Cir. 1996) (“evidentiary\nhearings are not required when . . . the record conclusively shows that the petitioner is entitled to\nno relief.”).  Because the files and records of the case conclusively show that Petitioner is not\nentitled to relief as to any of the claims in this § 2255 motion, an evidentiary hearing is not\nnecessary and the matter is ripe for a decision by this Court.  \n3\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 4 of 8    Pg ID 3842\nANALYSIS \nA. Petitioner May Not Rely On Johnson To Collaterally Attack § 924(c) Convictions\nTo the extent that Petitioner relies on Johnson, the Government argues that “the Sixth\nCircuit has declined to extend Johnson to section 924(c) convictions.”  (Gov’t Resp. at 2).  The\nCourt agrees that Petitioner may not rely on Johnson to collaterally attack his § 924(c)\nconviction.  \nIn Johnson v. United States, the Supreme Court invalidated the ACCA residual clause for\nbeing unconstitutionally vague.  Johnson, 135 S.Ct. At 2257.  Here, Petitioner cannot rely on\nJohnson for relief because the Court did not sentence Petitioner under the ACCA’s residual\nclause.  Nor was Petitioner sentenced under the ACCA.   \nPetitioner appears to be relying on Johnson to collaterally attack his 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\nconviction.  Presumably, Petitioner’s position is that Johnson reaches § 924(c)’s definition of a\n“crime of violence” since section 924(c)(3) includes a residual clause similar to the ACCA\nresidual clause invalidated in Johnson.  See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(B).  \nUnder § 924(c), anyone who uses or carries a firearm during or in relation to a “crime of\nviolence” is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence.  For purposes of § 924(c), a “crime of\nviolence” is a felony offense that: \n(A) has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson or property of another, or \n(B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or\nproperty of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3).  “The first clause, 924(c)(3)(B), is commonly referred to as the ‘force’\nclause.  The second, 924(c)(3)(B), is commonly referred to as the ‘residual’ clause[.]” United\n4\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 5 of 8    Pg ID 3843\nStates v. Moore, 2016 WL 2591874, at *3 (E.D. Mich. May 5, 2016).  \nHere, the predicate crime of violence charged in this case was a Hobbs Act robbery (i.e.,\nrobbery affecting interstate commerce).  A Hobbs Act robbery, by definition, requires “actual or\nthreatened force, or violence, or fear of injury.”  18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(1).  This definition fits\nsquarely within the definition of “crime of violence” as set forth the “force” clause of §\n924(c)(3)(A).  Thus, there is no need to resort to the “residual” clause of § 924(c)(3)(B) to\ndetermine whether a Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a “crime of violence” for purposes of §\n924(c) firearm charges.  See Washington v. United States, 2016 WL 4089133, at *1 (E.D. Mich.\nAug. 2, 2016) (“Courts both within this Circuit and outside of it have held, even in the wake of\nJohnson, that Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a crime of violence under the force clause of §\n924(c)(3)(A), not the residual clause”).  \nMoreover, even if it were necessary to rely upon the residual clause of § 924(c)(3)(B) to\nestablish whether or not a Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a “crime of violence,” Petitioner would\nstill not be entitled to the relief he seeks.  To the extent that Petitioner is arguing that the residual\nclause under § 924(c)(3) is vague and unconstitutional because it uses the phrase “crime of\nviolence” or because it contains a residual clause similar to that of the ACCA, this argument has\nalready been rejected by the Sixth Circuit and district courts within it.  See, e.g., United States v.\nTaylor, 814 F.3d 340, 379 (6th Cir. 2016) (rejecting the petitioner’s “argument that Johnson\neffectively invalidated § 924(c)(3)(B)”); Moore v. United States, 2017 WL 68494 (N.D. Ohio\n2017) (same).\nB. Petitioner’s Reliance on Rosemond is Misplaced \nTo the extent that Petitioner relies on Rosemond, the Government argues that the “record\n5\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 6 of 8    Pg ID 3844\nin this case clearly establishes that Dismukes used and carried a gun during the robbery, and that\n[Petitioner] had the requisite advance knowledge that Dismukes would have a gun during the\nrobbery.”  (Gov’t Resp. at 6-7).  The Court agrees. \nIn Rosemond, the Supreme Court clarified what is necessary to aid and abet a violation of\n§ 924(c).  The Supreme Court specifically explained that: \nAn active participant in a drug transaction [or in a crime of violence] has the\nintent needed to aid and abet a § 924(c) violation when he knows that one of his\nconfederates will carry a gun.  In such a case, the accomplice has decided to join\nin the criminal venture, and share in its benefits, with full awareness of its\nscope–that the plan calls not just for a drug sale, but an armed one.  In so doing,\nhe has chosen ... to do what he can to “make [that scheme] succeed.”  Nye &\nNissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766.  He thus becomes responsible, in the\ntypical way of aiders and abettors, for the conduct of others.  He may not have\nbrought the gun to the [deal] himself, but because he took part in that deal\nknowing a confederate would do so, he intended the commission of a § 924(c)\noffense–i.e., an armed drug sale. \nFor all that to be true, though, the § 924(c) defendant’s knowledge of a firearm\nmust be advance knowledge–or otherwise said, knowledge that enables him to\nmake the relevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice.  When an accomplice knows\nbeforehand of a confederate’s design to carry a gun, he can attempt to alter that\nplan or, if unsuccessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go\nahead with his role in the venture that shows his intent to aid and armed offense. .\n. . \nRosemond, 134 S.Ct. at 1249. (emphasis in original).  \nHere, Petitioner pleaded guilty to robbing, and aiding and abetting Jesse Dismukes in\nrobbing, a Radio Shack store on February 3, 2013.  And while Petitioner was unarmed during the\nrobbery, he pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Jesse Dismukes in using or carrying a firearm\nduring the robbery.  At his plea hearing, Petitioner testified that he intended to help Dismukes\nrob the store.  (Doc. 3 407, Plea Hearing Trans. at 21).  Petitioner further testified that, prior to\nentering the store on February 3, 2013, he knew that Dismukes had a gun. (Id. at 22).  \n6\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 7 of 8    Pg ID 3845\nBased upon Petitioner’s own admissions, it is clear that he had advance knowledge of the\ngun prior to the commission of the robbery and that he therefore intended to aid in the armed\noffense.  As such, Petitioner’s 924(c) conviction, as an aider and abettor, fully comports with the\nrequirements set forth in Rosemond. \n C. Certificate of Appealability \nA certificate of appealability must issue before a petitioner may appeal the district court’s\ndenial of his § 2255 Motion.  28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(B); Fed. R. App. P. 22(b).  28 U.S.C. 2253\nprovides that a certificate of appealability may issue only if a petitioner makes a substantial\nshowing of a denial of a constitutional right.  28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2).  \n“Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claim on the merits, the showing\nrequired to satisfy 2253(c) is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable\njurists would find the district court’s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or\nwrong.”  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\nThe Court concludes that reasonable jurists would not find the Court’s assessment of\nPetitioner’s claims debatable or wrong.  As such, the Court declines to issue a certificate of\nappealability.  \nCONCLUSION & ORDER \nFor the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Petitioner’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255\nmotion (Doc. # 417) is DENIED.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner’s Motion for\nAppointment of Counsel (Doc. # 388) is DENIED AS MOOT. \nAdditionally, this Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability.  This Court also\ncertifies, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that an appeal from this decision could not be taken \n7\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 426   Filed 03/31/17   Pg 8 of 8    Pg ID 3846\nin good faith. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  March 31, 2017 s/Sean F.

ZATKOFF \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  This matter is before the Court on Defendant Timothy Ivory Carpenter’s (“Carpenter”) \nMotion to Dismiss the Third Superseding Indictment (Docket #116).  The Government filed a \nresponse  brief.1    Carpenter  did  not  file  a  reply.    The  Court  finds  that  the  facts  and  legal \narguments  pertinent  to  the  motion  are  adequately  presented  in  the  parties’  papers,  and  the \n                                                 \n1By the time the Government filed its response brief, the Government had filed a Fourth \nSuperseding Indictment.  In the Fourth Superseding Indictment, Carpenter is charged with an \nadditional four crimes.  Each of the new charges, however, is for a crime of the nature with \nwhich he previously was charged.  Thus, the same substantive case law and arguments pertain to \nthe four new charges.  No additional charges have been filed against Carpenter since the \nGovernment’s response brief was filed.  Therefore, this Opinion addresses and governs all \ncharges the Government has filed against Carpenter in this case. \n \n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 168   Filed 10/21/13   Pg 2 of 6    Pg ID 759\n \ndecision process will not be aided by oral arguments.  Therefore, pursuant to E.D. Mich. Local \nR. 7.1(f)(2), it is hereby ORDERED that the motion be resolved on the papers submitted, without \nthis Court entertaining oral arguments.  For the reasons that follow, Carpenter’s motion is \ndenied.   \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n  On  July  10,  2013,  the  Grand  Jury  returned  a  Fourth  Superseding  Indictment \n(“Indictment”)  charging  Timothy  Carpenter  with  six  counts  of  robbery  affecting  interstate \ncommerce,  in  violation  of  18  USC  §1951  (Counts  One,  Three,  Seven,  Nine,  Eleven  and \nThirteen), and four counts of aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm during a federal \ncrime of violence, in violation of 18 USC § 924(c) (Counts Two, Four, Eight, Ten, Twelve, and \nFourteen).   \n  The charges in the Indictment stem from a series of alleged robberies of four Radio \nShack stores (on December 13, 2010, April 5, 2011, April 11, 2011, and December 1, 2012), and \ntwo T-Mobile stores (on December 18, 2010 and October 31, 2012).   In each of Counts One, \nThree, Seven, Nine, Eleven and Thirteen, Carpenter is alleged to have: \nknowingly and unlawfully took, and aided and abetted others in taking, personal \nproperty from the person or presence of another through actual and threatened \nforce and violence and by causing the victims to have a fear of immediate injury \nto  their  person  during  the  defendants’  robbery  of  [the  store]  and  thereby \nobstructed, delayed, and affected interstate commerce, in violation of [18 U.S.C.] \n§ 1951(a). \n \nIn each of Counts Two, Four, Eight, Ten, Twelve and Fourteen, Carpenter is alleged to have: \nknowingly used and carried, and aided and abetted others in using and carrying, a \nfirearm  during  and  in  relation  to  [a]  robbery  charged  in  [a  count  of  this \n \n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 168   Filed 10/21/13   Pg 3 of 6    Pg ID 760\n \nIndictment],  during  which  a  firearm  was  brandished,  all  in  violation  of  [18 \nU.S.C.] § 924(c)(1). \n \n  III.  ANALYSIS \n  Carpenter makes three arguments in support of his motion to dismiss the Indictment.  \nA.   Absence of Allegation of Intentional Facilitation  \n  or Encouragement under § 924(c) \n \n  Carpenter first argues that the Indictment contains no allegation of intentional facilitation \nor encouragement of the use of a firearm.  Some circuits require direct proof that the defendant \nfacilitated or encouraged the use of a firearm during the commission of the crime.  As Carpenter \nacknowledges,  however,  the  Sixth  Circuit  does  not  require  direct  proof  of  facilitation  or \nencouragement.  See  United  States  v.  Gardner,  488  F.3d  700,  712  (6th  Cir.  2007)  (“the \ngovernment must prove ‘that the defendant as the accomplice, associated and participated in the \nuse of the firearm in connection with the underlying ... crime.’”) (quoting United States v. \nFranklin, 415 F.3d 537, 554-55 (6th Cir. 2005)).  Though the U.S. Supreme Court has granted \ncertiorari to resolve a circuit split on this issue, there is no governing U.S. Supreme Court law on \nthe issue.  Therefore, this Court must apply the current law of the Sixth Circuit.  As such, \nCarpenter’s motion must be denied as it relates to his argument that the Indictment does not \nallege intentional facilitation or encouragement of the use of a firearm.    \nB.   Absence of Allegation that Carpenter Performed any Act  \n  to Facilitate or Encourage the Use of a Firearm \n \n  Carpenter next argues that the Government used only general and conclusory language to \nallege that he “knowingly used and carried” a firearm and there is no fact alleged that he ever \n \n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 168   Filed 10/21/13   Pg 4 of 6    Pg ID 761\n \nknowingly carried or used a firearm himself.  Carpenter further states that, based on all the \ndiscovery produced by the Government, there is no evidence the Government could present that \nCarpenter ever “knowingly used and carried” a firearm at any point on any of the days of the \nalleged robberies. \n  Carpenter argues that the Indictment in this case “must be accompanied with such a \nstatement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense, \ncoming under the general description, with which he is charged.” Russell v. United States, 369 \nU.S. 749, 765 (1963); see also Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974). Carpenter \nargues that the Indictment “contains no such statement of facts the [C]onstitution requires to \nsufficiently apprise Carpenter of the nature and circumstances of the alleged offense. Without \nsuch  critical  details,  Carpenter  is  unable  to  adequately  prepare  and  assist  in  his  defense.”  \nCarpenter further argues that Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth \nAmendment require that an indictment give notice of each of these elements with a sufficient \nstatement of facts to permit the defendant to prepare a defense at trial and for the court to rule on \nrelevance and admissibility of evidence. Russell, 369 U.S. at 765.  As such, Carpenter suggests \nthat, under these circumstances, “[a] bill of particulars cannot cure a legal deficiency; rather the \nproper result is dismissal of the indictment.” United States v. Superior Growers Supply Inc., 982 \nF.2d 173, 177 (6th Cir. 1992). \n  The Court finds that the Indictment satisfies the demands of the Sixth Circuit and U.S. \nSupreme Court.  There is no requirement that the Government set forth the factual predicate for a \ncharge in the Indictment; rather, as the Sixth Circuit has held, “[a]n indictment is usually \nsufficient if it states the offense using the words of the statute itself, as long as the statute fully \n \n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 168   Filed 10/21/13   Pg 5 of 6    Pg ID 762\n \nand unambiguously states all of the elements of the offense.” See United States v. Landham, 251 \nF.3d  1072,  1079  (6th  Cir.  2001);  United  States  v.  Hudson,  491  F.3d  590,  593  (6th  Cir. \n2007)(affirming  district  court’s  refusal  to  dismiss  an  indictment  that  tracked  the  statutory \nlanguage).  In this case, each count states:  (1) the date of the alleged offense, (2) the address and \ntype of store that was allegedly robbed, and (3) the elements of the charged crime, all of which \nare set forth in the statute, by tracking the statutory language.  Although the Government will \nhave to prove at trial that Carpenter: (a) “used and carried” a firearm, or (b) encouraged or \nfacilitated the use or carrying of a firearm by others, in order to convict Carpenter of a particular \ncharge, the Government has no obligation to set forth in the Indictment how it will do so.  \nAccordingly,  the  Court  denies  Carpenter’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  Indictment  based  on  this \nargument. \nC.   Allegations that Carpenter Aided and Abetted  \n  Violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951 and 924(c) \n \n  Finally, Carpenter argues that “the Indictment does not provide [him] any information as \nto how he allegedly aided and abetted in the commission” of the alleged robberies charged in \nCounts One, Three, Seven, Nine, Eleven and Thirteen and, therefore, must be dismissed.  And, \nCarpenter argues, as the Indictment fails to allege that he aided and abetted in the commission of \nthe predicate “crime of violence,” the charges pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Counts Two, Four, \nEight, Ten, Twelve, and Fourteen) also must be dropped.  As set forth in Section III.B., however, \nthe Government satisfied its burden in the preparation of the Indictment; there was no obligation \nto provide Carpenter with information as to how Carpenter aided and abetted in the commission \nof the robberies.  Moreover, the Government specifically charged Carpenter with aiding and \nabetting, even though the Sixth Circuit has held that an “an indictment need not specifically \n \n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 168   Filed 10/21/13   Pg 6 of 6    Pg ID 763\n \ncharge ‘aiding and abetting’ or ‘causing’ the commission of an offense...in order to support a \njury verdict based upon a finding of either. United States v. McGee, 529F.3d 691, 695 (6th Cir. \n2008) (citations omitted).  \n  Accordingly, the Court holds that Carpenter’s argument that the Government did not \nsufficiently allege that he aided and abetted with respect to the crimes charged lacks merit. \n \n  IV.  CONCLUSION \n  Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby DENIES Carpenter’s \nMotion to Dismiss the Third Superseding Indictment (Docket #116). \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n                                 S/Lawrence P.

Defendants Timothy Carpenter (“Carpenter”) and\nTimothy Sanders (“Sanders”) are proceeding to trial.  Defendants have filed the following two\nmotions in limine that are contested by the Government: 1) a motion seeking to suppress cell\nphone data, as violative of the Fourth Amendment; and 2) a motion seeking to preclude Special\nAgent Christopher Hess from testifying as an expert witness at trial.

Defendants Carpenter and Sanders are\nproceeding to trial.   \n The Government does not contend that either Carpenter or Sanders entered the stores\nduring the robberies.

One of the robberies occurred in Warren Ohio, while the\nother six robberies occurred in the Metropolitan Detroit area.  \nThe robberies that will be at issue at trial are those charged in Counts One through\nFourteen, which occurred during the time period from December 13, 2010 to December 1, 2012.\nOn May 2, 2011, and again on June 7, 2011, the Government applied for and obtained \ncourt orders under 18 U.S.C. § 2703 for toll records, call detail records, and cell/site section\ninformation for several different cell phone numbers, including (313) 579-8507 and (313) 412-\n6845.  (See 6/7/11 Order signed by Judge Stephen Murphy, D.E. No. 196-2; 5/2/11 Order signed\nby Magistrate Judge Michaelson, D.E. No.  221-3).  Those Orders state that the Government had\n“demonstrated to the Court that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information\nsought is relevant and material to a legitimate law enforcement investigation into possible\nviolations of Title 18, United States Code, § 1951.”  (Id. at 1) (emphasis added).\nAt trial, the Government intends to present evidence through F.B.I. Special Agent\nChristopher Hess that, on March 4, 2011, Sanders’s cell phone, (313) 579-8507, was located in a\ngeographic area consistent with the robbery charged in Count 7, which occurred in Warren,\nOhio.  It also intends to present evidence that Carpenter’s cell phone, (313) 412-6845, was in\nvarious areas consistent with robberies charged in other Counts.\nANALYSIS\nI. Motion to Suppress Cell Phone Data:  D.E. 196 (With Joinder in D.E. 214)\nIn this motion, Defendant Sanders asks the Court to suppress cell phone data for cell\nphone number (313) 579-8507 because the data was obtained in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.  He makes two arguments.  First, he argues that the “reasonable grounds standard”\n2\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 3 of 12    Pg ID 1215\nin the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2703 et seq. (“the Act”) is unconstitutional. \nSecond, he argues that the Government did not present sufficient “reasonable grounds”\ninformation in order to obtain the order in any event.  \nDefendant Carpenter filed a “Notice of Joinder” (D.E. No. 214), wherein he stated that he\n“adopts and joins in Defendant [Sanders’s] Motion in Limine To Suppress Cell Phone Data\n(R196).”  In a supplement to that notice, he states that “[e]xcept for the difference in phone\nnumbers referred to in the Order,” the same analysis applies.  (D.E. No. 216). \nA. Should The Data Be Suppressed Because The “Reasonable Grounds\nStandard” In The Act Unconstitutional?\nThe parties agree that, under the Act, the standard of proof required for the Court Orders\nat issue here is as follows:\n(d) Requirements for court order . . .  A court order for disclosure . . . shall issue\nonly if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that\nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . . records or other information\nsought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) (emphasis added).\nDefendants argue that the reasonable grounds standard in the Act is unconstitutional\nbecause a cell phone user has a reasonable expectation of privacy in prolonged surveillance data\nand therefore a probable cause determination should be required.  Defendants claim that the\nSixth Circuit has not addressed this issue and that lower courts that have addressed the issue\nhave been divided.  They rely on: 1) In re U.S. for Historical Cell Site Data, 747 F.Supp.2d 827\n(S.D. Tex. 2010), wherein the district court held that the warrantless seizure of cell cite records\nover a period of two months was unreasonable because the phone user has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in prolonged surveillance information); and 2) In re Application of U.S.,\n3\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 4 of 12    Pg ID 1216\n736 F.Supp.2d 578 (E.D. N.Y. 2010), wherein the district court also held that historical cell site\ndata is protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Those district court judges were influenced by case\nlaw holding that placing a G.P.S. tracking device on a vehicle requires a warrant.\nSanders’s brief, filed on November 21, 2013, indicates that the appeal in In re\nApplication of U.S. is still pending (see Sanders’s Br. at 5), but that is not the case.  On July 30,\n2013, the Fifth Circuit issued its decision reversing the lower court’s ruling.  \nIn response to Defendants’ motion, the Government notes that Defendants have not\ndirected the Court to a single decision by any United States Court of Appeals, much less the\nSixth Circuit, that supports their position.  The Government directs the Court to United States v.\nSkinner, 690 F.3d 772 (6th Cir. 2012).1  In that case, the authorities obtained court orders for\nsubscriber information, cell cite information, G.P.S. real-time location, and “ping” data for cell\nphones.  Id. at 776.  In affirming the district court’s ruling denying the defendant’s motion to\nsuppress, the Sixth Circuit held that there was “no Fourth Amendment violation because [the\ndefendant] did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data given off by his\nvoluntarily procured pay-as-you-go cell phone.”  Id. at 777. The Skinner court reaffirmed there is\nno legitimate expectation of privacy in cell site data because the “‘cell-site data is simply a\nproxy’” for the defendant’s visually observable location, and a defendant has no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in his movements along public highways.  Id. at 779 (quoting United\n1The Government also contends that if Section 2703(d) were found unconstitutional in\nthis case, the evidence should not be suppressed in any event because the agents relied in good\nfaith on the Act in obtaining the evidence.  (Govt.’s Br. at 5) (citing United States v. Warshak,\n631 F.3d 266, 288-89 (6th Cir. 2010)).  The Court agrees that this is an additional basis for\ndenying the motion. \n4\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 5 of 12    Pg ID 1217\nStates v. Forrest, 355 F.3d 942, 951-52 (6th Cir. 2004)).  The Skinner decision reflects that the\nSixth Circuit views obtaining routine cell phone data quite differently than it does data obtained\nvia a G.P.S. device being placed on a vehicle without a warrant:\nWhen criminals use modern technological devices to carry out criminal acts . . .\nthey can hardly complain when the police take advantage of the inherent\ncharacteristics of those very devices to catch them.  This is not a case in which the\ngovernment secretly placed a tracking device in someone’s car.\nId. at 774 (emphasis added).\nThis Court rejects Defendants’ argument that the Act is unconstitutional.\nB. Did The Government Present Sufficient Reasonable Grounds?\nIn this motion, Defendants also make a secondary argument that the Government did not\npresent sufficient reasonable grounds to obtain the orders in any event.  (See Sanders’s Br. at 2,\nasserting that, “upon information and belief,” the order was “obtained in violation of the Act\nbecause ‘reasonable grounds’ were not presented to obtain the Order.”). \nIn response, the Government contends it satisfied the applicable standard.  (See Govt.’s\nBr. at 5-6).  The Court agrees.\nThe Order that Sanders challenges is the one issued by Judge Murphy.  The Application\nthat requested that order (D.E. No. 221-2) set forth the factual basis for the Government’s\nrequest and included, among other things, that: 1) there was an ongoing criminal investigation as\nto a series of armed robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Detroit, Michigan; 2) the\nDetroit Police Department has arrested four individuals believed to be involved in the robberies;\n3) a cooperating defendant was interviewed, admitted his role as to nine robberies, identified\nothers involved in the robberies, indicated they planned to do additional robberies, and provided\nhis own cell phone number and those of others involved in the robberies; and 4) the cell site\n5\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 6 of 12    Pg ID 1218\nrecords are needed to assist in identifying and locating the other persons involved in the\nrobberies.  The application that requested the order challenged by Carpenter is nearly identical. \nThe Court finds that the Applications were supported by specific and articulable facts, and\ntherefore meets the “diminished standard that applies to § 2703(d) applications.”  United States\nv. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 291 (6th Cir. 2010).\nAccordingly, the Court shall deny this motion.\nII. Motion To Exclude Lay And Expert Testimony:  D.E. 211 (Joinder In D.E. 215)\nIn this motion, filed by Carpenter and joined by Sanders, Defendants ask the Court to\nenter an order excluding expert testimony regarding the operation of cell towers (i.e., the\ntestimony of Special Agent Hess).  They ask the Court to do so on several grounds, which are\naddressed below.\nA. Should The Court Exclude Hess’s Report Because It Is Untimely, Unfairly\nPrejudicial, And Fails To Meet Rule 16 Requirements?\nFirst, Defendants argue that the untimely production of Special Agent Hess’s report is\nunfairly prejudicial and fails to meet the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 16.  (Def.’s Br. at 3). \nCarpenter asserts that he received the discovery which relates to the testimony of Hess “just\nthree weeks before trial.”  He contends the tardiness of the report is prejudicial because the\nsubject matter (cell-site analysis) is specialized information and the “last-minute disclosure by\nthe Government leaves the Defendant without the tools to effectively cross-examine SA Hess.” \n(Id. at 4).  Carpenter also contends that Hess’s report is deficient because it does sufficiently\nexplain the bases and reasons for his opinions.\nAs the Government details in its Response Brief, Defense Counsel has been aware for at\nleast several months prior to trial that the Government would seek to present an expert witness\n6\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 7 of 12    Pg ID 1219\nin cell-site analysis at trial:\n1) On April 15, 2013, the Government filed a Discovery Notice (D.E. No. 89) advising\nCarpenter that it “intends to introduce at trial testimony from one or more experts in the\nfollowing areas of expertise: cell tower location analysis” and referencing evidence\ninvolving “telephone call records and location data.”  (Id.) (underlining in original);\n2) On August 16, 3023, the Government filed an identical notice as to Sanders.  (D.E. No.\n150);\n3) During a Status Conference on October 28, 2013, Defense Counsel stated that they\nneeded Special Agent Hess’s report in sufficient time that they could hire their own\nexperts.  The Court advised Defense Counsel of the recent case that Judge Borman had\ninvolving Hess, wherein another expert was called to rebut his testimony.  On that same\nday, the Court ordered the Government to provide Defense Counsel with Hess’s report no\nlater than November 7, 2013.  \n4) Neither Defendant filed a motion seeking the report earlier or asking the Court to adjourn\nthe trial date.\n5) The Government contends that it met the Court’s deadline for providing Hess’s report;\nand\n6) On November 22, 2013, Sanders submitted a witness list that identifies his own expert\nwitness, Ryan J. Harmon.  Carpenter joined in that witness list.\nThe Court rejects Defendants’ timeliness and unfair prejudice argument based on\ntimeliness arguments.\nDefendants also contend that Hess’s report does not provide sufficient information as to\nthe bases and reasons for his opinions.  That argument is also rejected.  Hess’s report contains a\nsection titled, “Basic Principals [sic] Utilized In Record Analysis” that explains the underlying\ntechnology and how it works.  Hess then applied those principles and opined that Defendants\nwere in geographic areas consistent with certain robberies.\nB. Should The Court Preclude Hess’s Proposed Expert Testimony Under Fed.\nR. Evid. 702 And Daubert?\nNext, Defendants ask this Court to preclude the Government from calling Special Agent\n7\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 8 of 12    Pg ID 1220\nHess as an expert at trial, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert, because his proposed\ntestimony is not sufficiently reliable to qualify as expert testimony.\n“District court judges must determine whether an expert’s testimony is both relevant and\nreliable when ruling on its admission.” Clay v. Ford Motor Company, 215 F.3d 663, 667 (6th\nCir. 2000).  A trial judge’s determinations regarding the admissibility of expert testimony are\nguided by Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579\n(1993).\nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs testimony by experts and provides as\nfollows:\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\ncase.\nFed. R. Evid. 702.\nUnder Daubert, the trial court acts as a “gatekeeper” that ensures that any and all\nscientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.  Daubert sets forth a\nnonexclusive list of factors relevant to this inquiry: 1) whether the theory or technique can be or\nhas been tested; 2) whether it has been subjected to peer review; 3) whether there is a known or\npotential rate of error; and 4) whether the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance in the\nrelevant scientific community.  Daubert, 509 U.S at 593-94.  In Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,\n526 U.S. 137 (1999), the Supreme Court confirmed that “the general gatekeeping obligation set\nforth in Daubert” “applies when considering all expert testimony, including testimony based on\n8\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 9 of 12    Pg ID 1221\ntechnical and other specialized knowledge.”  Clay v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d at 667.  “It\nfurther held that the specific Daubert factors – testing, peer review and publication, potential rate\nof error, and general acceptance in the relevant community – may be considered by the district\ncourt even when the proffered expert testimony is not scientific.”  Id.  Whether these specific\nfactors are reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law grants\nthe trial judge broad latitude to determine.   Id.\n“It is the proponent of the testimony that must establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of proof.”  Nelson v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 243 F.3d 244, 251 (6th Cir.\n2001) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592 n.10)).\nA district court is not obligated to hold a Daubert hearing (see Clay v. Ford Motor\nCompany, 215 F.3d at 667; Nelson, 243 F.3d at 249) and this Court declines to do so here.  A\nDaubert hearing is unnecessary in light of the full briefing of the issues by the parties and the\nmaterials submitted to date.\n1. The Proposed Expert Testimony Is Relevant\nHere, Defendants do not appear to dispute that Hess’s proposed testimony is relevant. \nAnd even if they did, the Court concludes that his testimony is relevant.\n“Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 401.\nThe proposed expert testimony is that, during the relevant times during which certain\nrobberies occurred, call activity from Defendants’ cell phones place them in the general area of\nthe stores where the robberies took place.  Such testimony is relevant because it makes a fact of\n9\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 10 of 12    Pg ID 1222\nconsequence in determining the action (whether Defendants were physically present near the\nstores on the dates and times of the robberies) more probable than it would be without the\nevidence.   Accordingly, the Court finds that Special Agent Hess’s specialized knowledge will\nhelp the trier of fact to understand the evidence and to determine a fact in issue in this case.  At\ntrial, however, a proper foundation will have to be established regarding the cell phones at issue\nbefore Special Agent Hess can testify.\n2. The Proposed Expert Testimony Is Sufficiently Reliable.\nThe Government’s Brief indicates that Special Agent Hess has testified as an expert in\ncell site analysis in over 25 criminal trials, including four cases in this district.  Indeed, Special\nAgent Hess recently testified as an expert witness in another criminal trial before this Court,\nUnited States v. Reynolds.  See United States v. Reynolds, 2013 WL 2480684 (E.D. Mich. June\n10, 2013).\nIn Reynolds, the defendant did not argue that Special Agent Hess is not qualified as an\nexpert in the area of cell site analysis.  Rather, he argued that cell site analysis should not be\npermitted because it is not sufficiently reliable because: 1) the testimony is based upon an\nunreliable methodology for the purpose for which it is offered; and 2) historical cell site analysis\nis inadmissible to establish a specific location.  Both of those arguments were premised on the\nassumption that the Government was going to have Special Agent Hess testify using cell site\nanalysis to opine that Defendant was present at a specific location on the relevant dates and\ntimes.  \nIn this case, the Government only seeks to have Hess testify that Defendants’ cell phones\nwere in geographic areas “consistent with” the locations where the robberies occurred.\n10\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 11 of 12    Pg ID 1223\nTestimony about cellular phone technology and the ability to determine the general area\nwhere calls are placed and received has been widely accepted by federal courts.  See e.g., United\nStates v. Weathers, 169 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir. 1999); United States v. Schaffer, 439 Fed. App’x\n344, 347 (5th Cir. 2011); United States v. Jones, __ F.2d __, 2013 WL 246615 (D.D.C. 2013);\nUnited States v. Benford, 2010 WL 2346305 (N.D. Ind. 2010); United States v. Allums, 2009 WL\n806748 (D. Utah 2009).  This Court again concludes that Special Agent Hess’s proposed\ntestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and he has reliably applied those\nprinciples and methods to the facts of this case.\nMoreover, Defense Counsel have indicated that Defendants may call their own expert\nwitness, to challenge the opinions of Special Agent Hess and provide opinion testimony\nregarding the locations of the cell phones at issue during the relevant time periods.  \nThe weight to be afforded any expert witness testimony presented at trial can be determined by\nthe jury.\nThe Court shall therefore deny without prejudice Defendants’ motion seeking to preclude\nthe expert testimony of Special Agent Hess and shall rule that although Special Agent Hess’s\nproposed testimony regarding cell site analysis is both relevant and reliable, that the Government\nmust lay an appropriate foundation before Special Agent Hess may testify at trial.\nCONCLUSION & ORDER\nFor the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion seeking to\nSuppress Cell Phone Data (D.E. Nos. 196 & 214) IS DENIED.\n11\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 227   Filed 12/06/13   Pg 12 of 12    Pg ID 1224\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\nDefendants’ motion seeking to preclude the expert testimony of Special Agent Hess (D.E.

Criminal Case No. 12-20218\nTimothy Ivory Carpenter D-4 and Honorable Sean F. Cox\nTimothy Michael Sanders D-11,\nDefendants.\n______________________________/\nOPINION & ORDER\nDENYING DEFENDANT CARPENTER’S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\nIn this action, multiple Defendants were charged with various counts stemming from a\nseries of robberies at cellular telephone stores.  Defendants Timothy Carpenter (“Carpenter”) and\nTimothy Sanders (“Sanders”) proceeded to a joint jury trial.   On December 18, 2013, the jury\nreturned its verdicts.  The jury found Defendant Carpenter not guilty as to Count Two and guilty\nas to all other counts against him.  The matter is now before the Court on Carpenter’s Motion for\nNew Trial.  The Court finds that the issues have been adequately presented in the parties’ briefs\nand that oral argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.  See Local Rule\n7.1(f)(2), U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan.  For the reasons set forth below, the\nCourt shall DENY the motion. \nBACKGROUND \nIn this action, multiple Defendants were charged with various counts stemming from a\nseries of robberies at cellular telephone stores.  Defendants Carpenter and Sanders, who are half-\n1\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 289   Filed 03/11/14   Pg 2 of 7    Pg ID 1487\nbrothers, proceeded to a joint jury trial.   \n At trial, the Government did not contend that either Carpenter or Sanders entered the\nstores during the robberies. Rather, the Government sought to establish that they acted as\nlookouts, getaway drivers, planners and the like.  One of the robberies occurred in Warren, Ohio,\nwhile the other six robberies occurred in the Metropolitan Detroit area.  \nThe robbery that occurred in Warren, Ohio is the robbery that was charged in Count\nSeven of the Fourth Superceding Indictment and both Defendants were charged in Count Seven. \nThus, the Government sought to prove that Carpenter and Sanders were both involved with the\nrobbery that occurred in Warren, Ohio.\nTrial in this matter commenced on December 5, 2013.  Notably, neither Carpenter nor\nSanders filed a motion for severance prior to trial.\nOn December 10, 2013, the Government called Adriane Foster (“Foster”), a former co-\ndefendant, as a witness.  During direct examination, Foster testified that he was contacted by\nCarpenter and asked to participate in a robbery in Warren, Ohio.  He testified that Carpenter\nplanned the robbery and that Sanders did not want anything to do with the robbery and would not\nallow the group that committed the robbery to use his van.\nThat testimony is inconsistent with Special Agent Vicente Ruiz’s written summary of an\ninterview with Foster on February 5, 2013.  Special Agent Ruiz’s written summary of that\ninterview states that Foster told him, with respect to the Warren, Ohio robbery, that: 1) he\nbelieved he was going to Ohio to hang out with friends but, on the way there, Sanders started to\nreveal his plan to rob a store; and 2) Sanders and Carpenter were in a lookout vehicle during that\nrobbery.  Thus, Agent Ruiz’s report indicates that Foster stated during the interview that both\n2\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 289   Filed 03/11/14   Pg 3 of 7    Pg ID 1488\nSanders and Carpenter were involved in the Warren, Ohio robbery.\nDuring cross-examination, Counsel for Carpenter attempted to show Agent Ruiz’s report\nto Foster, which Foster did not author, and had never seen before, in order to “refresh” Foster’s\nmemory.  Because Foster did not indicate that he had a memory problem, this Court did not\npermit Counsel for Carpenter to use Agent Ruiz’s report during his cross-examination.  Counsel\nfor Carpenter was  permitted to ask Foster if he previously told the FBI that Timothy Sanders, not\nTimothy Carpenter, planned the robbery.  Foster said that he had not.\nDuring his cross-examination, Counsel for Sanders asked Foster several questions about\nthe truthfulness of his trial testimony that Sanders had no involvement with the Ohio robbery,\nand Foster stated that he was testifying truthfully.\nOn December 10, 2013, Carpenter filed a Motion for Mistrial.  Counsel for Sanders then\nfiled a Joinder In Defendant Carpenter’s Motion For Mistrial.\nIn an Opinion & Order issued on December 17, 2013 (Docket Entry No. 245), this Court\ndenied both Carpenter and Sanders’s motions seeking a mistrial.  In doing so, this Court\nexplained:\n“Whether properly articulated as a question of prejudicial joinder requiring\nseverance, or a motion for mistrial resulting from prejudicial joinder,” the\nappropriate determination as to the pending motions is whether Defendant\nSanders or Carpenter can demonstrate sufficient prejudice to warrant a mistrial. \nUnited States v. Anderson, 353 F.3d 490, 502 (6th Cir. 2003).\nBoth Defendants assert that the Court should grant a mistrial because,\nduring a very limited1 portion of the trial, they had conflicting defenses or\npositions as to a specific witness.  \nBut the case law makes clear that severance is not mandated “whenever\n1Both Defendants had the same overall theory of defense at trial – that the cooperating co-\ndefendants were falsely implicating them in the robberies in order to obtain favorable treatment.  \n3\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 289   Filed 03/11/14   Pg 4 of 7    Pg ID 1489\ncodefendants have conflicting defenses.”  Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534,\n538 (1993).  Thus, “mutually antagonistic defenses are not prejudicial per se” and\nFed. R. Crim. P. 14 does not require severance even if some prejudice is shown. \nId. at 538-39.\n“Relief from prejudicial joinder is required ‘only if there is a serious risk\nthat a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants,\nor prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.’”\nAnderson, supra (quoting Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993)).  The\ndefendant bears the burden of making a “strong showing of factually specific and\ncompelling prejudice resulting from a joint trial.”  United States v. Moore, 917\nF.2d 215, 220 (6th Cir. 1990). \nSimilarly, fairness to the accused is the primary concern in ruling upon a\nmistrial motion.  United States v. Atisha, 804 F.2d 920, 925-26 (6th Cir. 1986).  A\nmistrial may be granted where there is a legitimate claim of seriously prejudicial\nerror.  United States v. Moore, 917 F.2d at 220. \nHere, however, neither Defendant Sanders nor Defendant Carpenter have\narticulated a specific trial right that has been compromised.  Nor have they\nestablished that anything that has occurred during the course of the joint trial,\nincluding the limited conflict in defense strategies, will prevent the jury from\nmaking a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.  This is especially so given\nthat the jury has been instructed to separately consider the evidence as to each\ndefendant.  United States v. Stull, 743 F.2d 439, 447 (6th Cir. 1984).\nAccordingly, the Court shall deny Defendants’ motions seeking a mistrial.\n(Id. at 4-6).\nOn December 18, 2013, the jury returned its verdicts.  The jury found Defendant\nCarpenter not guilty as to Count Two and guilty as to all other counts against him. \nOn December 31, 2013, Carpenter filed his Motion for New Trial.  (Docket Entry No.\n258).\nANALYSIS\nRule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures governs motions for new trial and\nprovides that “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a\nnew trial if the interests of justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a).  A decision to grant or\n4\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 289   Filed 03/11/14   Pg 5 of 7    Pg ID 1490\ndeny a motion for new trial under Rule 33 lies with the discretion of the trial court.  United States\nv. Sypher, 684 F.3d 622, 626 (6th Cir. 2012).\nHere, Carpenter’s Motion for New Trial raises two grounds for relief: 1) whether the\nCourt should grant Carpenter a new trial “because he was denied the opportunity to establish that\nAdriane Foster lied about Carpenter’s role in the Warren, Ohio robbery”; and 2) whether\nCarpenter is entitled to a new trial based due to the conflict of defenses and the antagonistic\nconduct of Sanders’ Counsel in cross-examining Foster.  \nAs to the second ground for relief, this Court has already considered Carpenter’s\nargument and ruled that Carpenter is not entitled to a new trial on this ground. (See Docket Entry\nNo. 245, 12/17/13 Opinion & Order).\nThe Court also finds Carpenter’s other ground for relief to lack merit.  This Court\ncontinues to believe that its ruling on the use of Agent Ruiz’s report during Carpenter’s cross-\nexamination of Foster was correct.\nIn his motion, Carpenter relies on Fed. R. Evid. 612 for the proposition that a party may\nuse any writing to refresh the memory of a witness.  But that rule addresses an adverse party’s\nright to discovery of materials used by a witness to refresh his or her memory.  And the cases\nrelied on by Carpenter are inapposite. It is well-established that counsel may use prior statement\nto refresh the memory of a witness (see, e.g. United States v. Caraway, 534 F.3d 1290, 1295\n(10th Cir. 2008).  Here, however, Agent Ruiz’s report was neither authored by nor adopted by\nFoster, and Foster did not indicate any difficulty with his memory.  Rather, he simply denied\nmaking the alleged statement. \n As the Government notes in its response, at trial, Carpenter’s Counsel could have asked\n5\n\n2:12-cr-20218-SFC-MKM   Doc # 289   Filed 03/11/14   Pg 6 of 7    Pg ID 1491\nAgent Ruiz about Foster’s prior statements, or sought to admit his report into evidence, but chose\nnot to do so. This was likely a tactical decision, and a reasonable one at that, given that Agent\nRuiz’s report stated that Foster implicated both Sanders and Carpenter as having served as\nlookouts during the Warren, Ohio robbery.\nMoreover, assuming arguendo that the prohibition on the use of Agent Ruiz’s report\nduring Carpenter’s cross-examination of Foster was error, it would have been harmless error.\nFor purposes of the jury’s verdict, it simply did matter who planned the robbery.  So long as each\nDefendant performed a lookout function he could be found guilty of aiding and abetting the\nrobbery.  Although Foster testified at trial that Carpenter planned the Warren, Ohio robbery and\nthat Sanders did not want anything to do with it, the jury found both Defendants guilty as aiders\nand abettors of that robbery.  Thus, the jury was persuaded by other evidence presented at trial as\nto Carpenter and Sanders having served as lookouts during the Warren, Ohio robbery, such as the\nvideotape evidence, and the jury was not misled by Foster’s testimony or any alleged inability to\nfully-cross-examine him.\nCONCLUSION & ORDER\nFor the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Carpenter’s Motion for\nNew Trial (Docket Entry No. 258) is DENIED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nS/Sean F.
