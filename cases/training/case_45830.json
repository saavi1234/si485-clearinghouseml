Kelly, Case No. 23-cv-00192-SPM (Doc. 48) as well as a Joint Motion to Stay Attorneys' Fees and Costs Pending Appeal filed by all of the parties in these consolidated cases (see Barnett (Doc. 267)). For good cause shown, the parties' Joint Motion to Stay Attorneys' Fees and Costs Pending Appeal (Barnett (Doc. 267)) is GRANTED. Per the parties' request, the Court stays all proceedings and vacates any deadlines relating to attorney fees, non-taxable expenses, or costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) until the State Defendants' appeals are finally concluded and are no longer subject to review by any court, whether by additional appeal, petitions for rehearing or re-argument, petitions for rehearing en banc, petitions for writ of certiorari, or otherwise. (See Doc. 267, pp. 34 (using this same language)). In accordance with the above, the two pending Motions for Attorneys' Fees (Barnett (Doc. 261) and Langley (Doc. 48)) are both DENIED as moot with leave to refile at the conclusion of all appeals in accordance with this Order.

While the case was not remanded to this Court, the Seventh Circuit wrote that \"we trust that the district court will enter appropriate orders promptly without the need for a formal command by this court.\" (Doc. 269, p. 2). Therefore, this Court will issue a Permanent Injunction and an Amended Clerk's Judgment in separate Orders in accordance with the Seventh Circuit's command (see Doc. 269) and with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 58 and 65. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to notify the Seventh Circuit of the issuance of the Permanent Injunction and Amended Clerk's Judgment once filed. Signed by Judge Stephen P. McGlynn on 12/9/2024.

Therefore, the Plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction is GRANTED. The State of Illinois is hereby ENJOINED from the enforcement of PICA's criminal penalties in accordance with 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. ยงยง 5/24-1(a)(14)(16) (bump stocks and assault weapons); 5/24-1.9(a)(h) (assault weapons and attachments); and 5/24-1.10(a)(h) (large-capacity magazines) against all Illinois citizens, effective immediately. The State of Illinois is also ENJOINED from enforcing the firearm registration requirements and penalties associated with entering false information on the endorsement affidavit for non-exempt weapons, magazines, and attachments previously required to be registered in accordance with 430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 65/4.1. This permanent injunction is STAYED for thirty (30) days.

          "description": "ORDER TRANSFERRING RELATED CASE. This matter is before the Court sua sponte for case management purposes. This action arises out of the same facts and is closely related to Harrel, et al. v. Raoul, et al., Case No. 23-141-SPM, which was filed before this action and is assigned to District Judge Stephen P. McGlynn. The law of this Circuit provides that related cases filed within the same District Court should be handled by a single District Judge. See, e.g., Smith v. Check-N-Go of Illinois, 200 F.3d 511, 513 n.1 (7th Cir. 1999); Blair v. Equifax Check Services, 181 F.3d 832, 839 (7th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to TRANSFER this case to District Judge McGlynn. All further pleadings filed herein shall be styled with the suffix -SPM. In light of this transfer, the Notice regarding consent at Doc. 11 is STRICKEN. Case reassigned to Judge Stephen P. McGlynn for all further proceedings. Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly no longer assigned to case. Signed by Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly on 1/30/2023. (nmf)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 01/30/2023)"
