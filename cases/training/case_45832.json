The plaintiffs were homeless New Yorkers who have been subjected to homeless sweeps and are at imminent risk of being subjected to homeless sweeps in the immediate future. The plaintiffs allege that the sweeps operations do not connect homeless New Yorkers with important social services and that the city&rsquo;s conduct at sweeps is not rationally connected to its stated goals of clearing structures and addressing sanitation conditions. The plaintiffs argued that the City&rsquo;s homeless sweeps have violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Article XVII of the New York State Constitution, and the laws of the City and State of New York.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit sought to certify as a class action case for two categories. First, the Property Class: Every homeless person who has had and/or will have their personal belongings seized and/or destroyed by the City of New York during a cleanup of a homeless hotspot, popup, or encampment. Second, the Forced Relocation Class: Every homeless person who has been and/or will be forced to leave the place where they reside by the City of New York due to the City&rsquo;s policy and practice regarding a cleanup of a homeless hotspot, popup, or encampment.</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2024, the case was assigned to Judge John G. Koeltl. On the same day, Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker was also assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>As of November 24, 2024, this case is ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiffs bring this putative class action to challenge the policy and custom of \nโhomeless sweeps,โ also referred to herein as โsweeps,โ where Defendant City of New York (โthe \nCityโ), and its agents and agencies, seize and destroy the personal belongings of homeless New \nYorkers residing outdoors (โhomeless residentsโ) without due process and force them to move \nalong from relatively established locations, depriving some of the Cityโs most vulnerable residents \n  1    \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 2 of 71\nof their basic necessities and leaving them endangered and in peril.1 \n2.  The City currently carries out thousands of homeless sweeps per year.  From \nOctober 2021 through June 2024, the City conducted over 11,500 sweeps.2  During these sweeps, \nthe City seizes and destroys items that are critical to homeless residentsโ survival, including warm \nclothing, medications, bedding, and personal documentation (i.e., identification cards and birth \ncertificates) needed to access public services, secure permanent housing, seek employment, and \napply for public benefits.  \n3.  The City consistently fails to give adequate, timely notice to homeless residents in \nadvance of sweeps and, in many instances, does not give any notice at all.  In cases where the City \ndoes provide advance notice of a sweep, the notice does not state the basis for the sweep, offer any \navenue for homeless residents to contest the sweep, or sufficiently alert homeless residents to the \nrisk that they may have their personal property seized and destroyed during a sweep.  \n4.  The City does not offer any kind of post-deprivation mechanism for lawful owners \nto reclaim personal property that was taken.  Instead, sweeps teams throw homeless residentsโ \nbelongings in a sanitation truck and summarily destroy them with the trucksโ compactors. \n5.  The City also forcibly displaces homeless residents during sweeps, making them \nrelocate from sites where they have sought shelter and security. \n6.  The  City  carries  out  sweeps  pursuant  to  a  written  policy,  which  is  facially \ninadequate and unconstitutional, and it deviates from that policy in practice in ways that are \nunlawful and unconstitutional. \n \n1 The City refers to โhomeless sweepsโ as โcleanups.โ \n2 Plaintiff UJC-SNP obtains date and location data regarding homeless sweeps by routinely \nsubmitting Freedom of Information Law (โFOILโ) requests to the New York City Department of \nSocial Services and New York City Department of Sanitation. \n  2    \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 3 of 71\n7.  The City purports to conduct sweeps to connect homeless New Yorkers with social \nservices, dismantle physical structures it deems illegal or unsafe, address sanitation conditions, \nand provide temporary storage for residentsโ personal belongings. The reality, however, is that \ndisplacing homeless people and seizing and destroying their personal belongings does nothing to \nadvance these goals. \n8.  Organizational Plaintiff Urban Justice Center โ Safety Net Project (โUJC-SNPโ) is \na direct services provider that renders assistance to homeless New Yorkers who experience \nhomeless sweeps and has diverted significant organizational resources to doing so.  \n9.  The Individual Plaintiffs are homeless New Yorkers who have been subjected to \nnumerous homeless sweeps and are at imminent risk of being subjected to additional homeless \nsweeps  in  the  immediate  future.    The  Cityโs  homeless  sweeps  have  violated  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffsโand all similarly situated personsโunder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, as well as Article XVII of the New York State Constitution, and \nthe laws of the City and State of New York. \n10.  Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to the violations of Plaintiffsโ rights \nand knowingly facilitated the displacement of homeless New Yorkers and destruction of their \nproperty. \n11.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs now bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves \nand all similarly situated New Yorkers in order to end the unlawful and inhumane policy and \ncustom of homeless sweeps. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ federal claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a), and over their state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. \n13.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of  \n  3    \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 4 of 71\nPlaintiffsโ claims arose in the Southern District of New York. \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff UJC-SNP is one of eight independent projects of the Urban Justice Center, \na nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization incorporated in the State of New York. UJC-SNP conducts its \noperations in the City, County, and State of New York. \n15.  Plaintiff Gerald Bethel was at all relevant times an unhoused resident of New York \nCity. \n16.  Plaintiff Trese Chapman was at all relevant times an unhoused resident of New \nYork City. \n17.  Plaintiff Antonia Hayes was at all relevant times an unhoused resident of New York \nCity. \n18.

Homeless Sweeps in New York City \nA.  New  York  City  is  Experiencing  Record  Levels  of  Homelessness  and \nSystemically-Created Street Homelessness  \n35.

In August 2024, there were approximately 147,106 reported homeless people \nresiding in New York Cityโs shelter system, including almost 32,000 individuals staying at migrant \nshelters.6   The City estimated that there were 4,140 people living unsheltered in New York City7 \nas of January 2024 pursuant to the Homeless Outreach Population Estimate (โHOPEโ).8   That, \nhowever, is widely considered to be a significant undercount due to the methodological flaws \ninherent in a one-night point-in-time count.9 \n \n4 Coalition for the Homeless, Basic Facts About Homelessness: New York City (Jun. 2024), \nhttps://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city. \n5 U.S. Depโt of Hous. & Urban Dev., 2023 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to \nCongress (โAHARโ), Part 1: Point-In-Time Estimates of Homelessness (Dec. 2023) 20โ21, https://\nwww.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/2023-ahar-part-1.Pdf  [https://perma.cc/25X9-\n3U4V]. \n6 Patrick Spauster et al., NYC Shelter Count, City Limits, https://citylimits.org/nyc-shelter-\ncount (last visited Oct. 29, 2024); see also, Patrick Spauster et al., Tracking NYCโs Record-High \nHomeless  Shelter  Population,  City  Limits  (Dec.  7,  2023),  https://citylimits.org/2023/12/07/\ntracking-nycs-record-high-homeless-shelter-population. \n7 The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (โHUDโ) estimated \nthat there were 5,007 individuals living unsheltered in New York State during its January 2023 \npoint-in-time count.

New York City offers shelter through a network of municipal shelter systems \npursuant to the Callahan consent decree and subsequent judgments, which recognized the right to \nshelter guaranteed under the New York State Constitution.10 Nevertheless, distinct populations of \nhomeless people are denied equal access to shelter. This includes homeless migrants who arrived \nin the United States after March 15, 202211 and populations such as LGBTQ+ adults,12 domestic \nviolence survivors,13 and runaway and homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 24 due to bed \nshortages in shelters designed for vulnerable populations.14  In addition, many homeless New \nYorkers cannot access shelter for reasons such as an unwillingness on the part of shelters to \nreasonably accommodate their disabilities, their past traumatic incidents in the shelter system, and \n \nhomelesslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HUD-PIT-report2017.pdf [https://perma.cc/6CBS-\nFR3U]. \n10 Coalition For the Homeless, The Callahan Legacy: Callahan v.

Due to systemic barriers to accessing shelter, thousands of unhoused New Yorkers \nhave little choice but to reside in the street with their belongings.  \nB.  New York City has a Long History of Policing and Criminalizing Street \nHomeless Individuals \n39.  โHomeless sweepsโ refer to the Cityโs policy and custom of seizing and destroying \nthe personal belongings of homeless persons residing on the streets in New York City and forcing \nthese  persons  to  temporarily  or  permanently  relocate.    The  City  refers  to  this  practice  as \nโcleanups.โ \n40.  The interagency machinery that underpins New York Cityโs current municipal \npolicy on sweeps has existed since 2015.  The first official sweeps policy document laying out a \nversion of this municipal policy in written form was issued by DHS in 2017 and subsequently \nrevised in 2020 and 2022.  The most recent iteration of the written policy was issued in June 2024. \n41.  New York City, however, has a long history of enacting punitive policies and \npractices that seek to remove homeless individuals from public space, criminalize and police them, \nand violate their civil and constitutional rights.  Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, police \nofficers conducted โcleanup drives,โ primarily targeting street homeless people residing along the \nBowery on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which continued under several administrations.15  \nIn 1982, the NYPD established a unit within itself known as the Homeless Outreach Unit, \noriginally designed to forcibly move homeless people out of city transit facilities and into shelters \n \n15 Thomas J. Main, Homelessness in New York City: Policymaking from Koch to DeBlasio \n(NYU Press, 2016) 13. \n \n  1 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 12 of 71\nor social service programs.16  In the late 1990s, the NYPD implemented a practice of arresting \nstreet  homeless  individuals  who  refused  to  comply  with  move  along  orders  or  to  accept \ntransportation to a congregate shelter.  Between November 23 and December 10, 1999, 226 \nhomeless people were arrested in New York City.17 Throughout the Bloomberg administration, in \nthe early 2000s, the City instituted a practice of giving homeless people one-way tickets out of \nNew York City, a measure that Mayor Bloomberg believed would reduce the cityโs โchronic \nhomelessโ population by simply diverting them elsewhere.18 \n42.  In 2015, under the De Blasio administration, the City created an interagency \napparatus to conduct sweeps.  This was comprised of teams of workers from different municipal \nagencies, including DHS, DSNY, and the NYPD, to conduct sweeps of homeless sites.19 \n43.  From 2016 to 2020, the City steadily and significantly increased the number of \nhomeless sweeps that it conducted each year, according to data produced by DSS: roughly 155 \nsweeps in 2016, 426 above-ground sweeps in 2017, 507 sweeps in 2018, 668 sweeps in 2019, and \n1293 above-ground sweeps in 2020.20 \n \n16 Siya Hegde and Carlton Martin, With Liberty and Justice for ALL: The Case for \nDecriminalizing Homelessness and Mental Health in America, 21 Indiana Health L.

The City continued to sweep homeless New Yorkers at alarming rates throughout \nthe height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when overcrowded congregate shelters presented serious \nhealth and safety risks to residents, employees, and the broader community.21  These sweeps were \ncarried out in blatant violation of Center for Disease Control Guidance, which advised cities \nagainst sweeping homeless encampments during this period due to the dangers it created, including \nthe increased spread of COVID-19.22 \n45.  In the Summer of 2020, in recognition of the counter-productive impact that police \nofficers have on homeless residents during sweeps, the City stated that they would be removing \nNYPD officers from homeless outreach and sweeps teams and eventually disbanded the NYPD \nHomeless  Outreach  Unit.23  However,  upon  information  and  belief,  in  practice,  the  NYPD \ncontinued to be present at many sweeps of homeless New Yorkers. The NYPDโs role in sweeps \noperations was further expanded in early 2022 under the Adams administration, with the NYPD \ndeciding which encampments would get swept and officers attending all scheduled sweeps.24 \n \n21 As of June 1, 2020, the age-adjusted mortality rate for homeless New Yorkers in shelters \nwas 61% higher than the New York City rate.  In April 2020 alone, 58 homeless New Yorkers \ndied of COVID-19, 54 of whom resided in the shelter system.

In 2021, the De Blasio administration dramatically expanded the number of sweeps \noccurring per year, with 6,604 sweeps scheduled in that year. \n47.  This escalation continued with the administration of Mayor Eric Adams. In March \n2022, Mayor Adams convened a task force consisting of DHS, the NYPD, DSNY, and the Parks \nDepartment to dismantle homeless encampments across the City.25  The City reportedly swept 239 \nsites in 12 days, affecting hundreds of homeless individuals, with only five individuals swept by \nthe City ultimately obtaining shelter placements.26 \n48.  The City ramped up sweeps of homeless New Yorkers during the summer and fall \nof 2023, at a rate of roughly 500 sweeps per month.27 \nC.  Sweeps Cause Irreparable Harm to Homeless New Yorkers \n49.  The City of New York carries out thousands of homeless sweeps each year.

The City carries out sweeps consistently throughout the year, including in below-\nfreezing temperatures during the winter months and during heatwaves in the summer months.  It \nforces people to relocate before depriving them of life-preserving warm clothing, blankets, \nwaterproof coverings, and medications, often with very limited to no warningโa deprivation that \nwould be widely acknowledged as unlawful if carried out against housed residents in analogous \ncontexts.  By way of contrast, the City neither approaches nor seizes the personal property of \nhoused New Yorkers who they find picnicking or napping in the park, or resting on benches. \n51.  During  sweeps,  the  City  has  summarily  seized  and  destroyed  vital  personal \ndocumentation that homeless New Yorkers need to access public benefits, enter low-barrier \nshelter, apply for permanent or transitional housing, and obtain employment.  Along with life-\nsustaining property, the City has destroyed personal items of sentimental value, including family \nheirlooms and photographs of deceased loved ones that are irreplaceable. \n52.  The seizure and destruction of homeless residentsโ personal belongings during \nsweeps has been well documented in the media.29   Homeless residents have reported having their \nencampments trashed, their valuable possessions thrown into the back of sanitation trucks and \ncompacted on the spot, and being aggressively forced to move along by NYPD officers.30 \n53.

In addition, sweeps teams often arrive early in the morning, which negatively \naffects homeless residentsโ ability to sleep as they do not know when they are going to be woken \nup and moved along.  This causes them to experience anxiety and hypervigilance in their day-to-\nday lives.33 \n55.  Homeless residents have reported that the presence of numerous armed NYPD \nofficers at sweeps causes them to feel intimidated, distrustful, and fearful for their personal safety. \n56.  Sweeps have had serious ramifications for the health of homeless New Yorkers.  \nThe City has carried out sweeps during the height of winter and removed blankets, tarps, warm \nclothing and other belongings that Plaintiffs require to survive in sub-freezing temperatures.  The \nCity has also swept homeless residents during heavy rain and flooding, destroyed their belongings, \nand displaced them from sites where they were sheltering from the rain.  The City carries out \nsweeps during heatwaves, forcing people to leave shaded sites that offer protection from the harsh \nsun.34  On or around September 29, 2023, for example, the City conducted a sweep of eight \n \n31 See Yi, supra n.27. \n32 See, e.g., Karen Doran et al., Overdose and Homelessness โ Why We Need to Talk About \nHousing,  JAMA  Network  Open  (2022),  https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/\nfullarticle/2787718 (โ[c]onstant movement, as induced by frequent street or encampment sweeps, \nmakes connecting to resources and supports even more difficultโ). \n33 Dean Moses, Living in Fear: How NYCโs Homeless Struggle with Anxiety Amid Ongoing \nEncampment  Evictions,  AMNY  (Apr.  5,  2022),  https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-homeless-\nstrugle-anxiety-encampment-evictions. \n34 A study of the criminalization of homelessness in Denver found that depriving people of \nlife-sustaining belongings led to a significant increase in health issues caused by exposure to the \n \n  1 6   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 17 of 71\nSpanish-speaking homeless individuals near the Brooklyn Queens Expressway during a local state \nof emergency caused by flash flooding and heavy rain, forcing them to move from their location \nunder an overpass where they had found shelter. \n57.  Sweeps have prevented homeless New Yorkers from seeking out critical medical \ncare or attending important court dates due to fear that the City will arrive unannounced and \ndestroy all of their possessions. \n58.  Homeless New Yorkers with existing physical conditions or injuries have also \nreported that sweeps have exacerbated those conditions as the City forces them to hurriedly \ntransport heavy items during sweeps, and often disposes of medical equipment and medications \nneeded to treat their conditions. \n59.  Sweeps have also inflicted lasting physical and psychological damage on each of \nthe individual Plaintiffs.  The experience of being directed to leave their sites and then forced to \nwatch as the City disposes of all their worldly belongings is deeply traumatizing, let alone having \nthis occur repeatedly. \n60.  By displacing homeless New Yorkers and forcing them to perpetually relocate, \nhomeless sweeps prevent the formation of community ties, jeopardize peopleโs current and \nprospective employment, and have an incredibly destabilizing effect on the lives of this highly \nvulnerable  population,  making  it  even  more  difficult  for  them  to  obtain  housing  and  exit \n \nelements, such as frostbite, heatstroke and dehydration.  See Marisa Westbrook & Tony Robinson, \nUnhealthy By Design: Health and Safety Consequences of the Criminalization of Homelessness, \n30 J. Soc. Distress & Homelessness 107, 111โ12 (2020); see also Chang et al., Harms of \nEncampment Abatements on the Health of Unhoused People, SSM โ Qualitative Research in Heath \n9  (Dec.  2022),  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000269 \n(โunhoused peopleโs health is harmed directly through encampment sweeps, or through the \nperilous social environmental conditions created by themโ). \n  1 7   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 18 of 71\nhomelessness.35 \n61.  The upshot of this policy or custom is that, in the midst of a housing and eviction \ncrisis, the City is depriving homeless people of items that are critical to their human survival and \ndisplacing them from sites where they have sought shelter. \nII.  New York City Has a Persistent and Widespread Policy or Custom of Conducting \nHomeless Sweeps in a Way that Violates the Civil and Constitutional Rights of \nHomeless New Yorkers \n62.  DHS-PB-2024-011 (โDHS Sweeps Policyโ), revised in 2020, 2022, and most \nrecently in June 2024, is the Cityโs primary agency-level written policy that sets out the process \nfor conducting sweeps.  The policy authorizes representatives of City agencies to displace \nhomeless residentsโby requiring people to remove themselves from their site while the City \nโcleansโ the areaโand dispose of any personal belongings left behind.  \n63.  Per the policy, sweeps are carried out by DHS and โits partner agencies.โ  These \ninclude the NYPD, DSNY, the Parks Department, CDOT, SDOT, and NYCEDC, depending on \nthe location of the sweep.  \n64.  The DHS Sweeps Policy categorizes homeless sites into โencampments,โ โpop-\nups,โ and โhotspots,โ which are very broadly  defined.36  The City performs โcleanupsโ of \n \n35 See Samir Junejo et al., No Rest for the Weary: Why Cities Should Embrace Homeless \nEncampments,  Homeless  Rights  Advocacy  Project  (2016)  4,  https://\ndigitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?  article=1006&context=hrap  (โDisrupting \nencampments harms residents by taking away the safety of community, and forcing them into a \ndaily nightmare of searching for security, shelter, and food, making it impossible to focus on \nlonger-term measures to end their homelessness.โ). \n36 An โencampmentโ is defined as โ[a] fixed or temporary physical structure built or set up \nas a shelter or dwelling in an area not meant for people to live, such as areas without sanitation \nservices, water, trash removal, etc.โ  A โpop-upโ is defined as โ[a]n area not meant for people to \nlive where individuals and groups regularly sleep without fixed comforts (e.g., furniture, standing \nstructures, curtains, mattresses).โ  A โhotspotโ is defined as โ[a]n area not meant for people to live \nwhere groups of people who are unsheltered gather regularly.โ \n  1 8   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 19 of 71\nโencampments,โ โpop-ups,โ and โhotspots.โ \n65.  The policy further distinguishes between โcleanupsโ and โemergency cleanups.โ \n66.  โCleanupโ is defined as โ[a] multi-agency operation to address illegal, unsanitary, \nor unsafe street conditions AND give people who are unsheltered access to social services, \nhousing, and other help.โ \n67.  โEmergency cleanupโ is defined as โ[a] multi-agency cleanup operation done \nwithout notice or with minimal prior notice due to conditions that pose a potential health and safety \nrisk to people who live there or the public.โ \n68.  In addition to the DHS Sweeps Policy, partner agencies involved in sweeps have \ntheir own internal policies and procedures that prescribe processes to be followed during sweeps.  \nThese include, but are not limited to, the NYPDโs โHomeless Encampment Guidelinesโ and \nDSNYโs โHomeless Individuals Cleanup Procedures.โ \n69.  DHS periodically issues new iterations of its sweeps policy which are assigned \nunique policy numbers.  Each version of the policy enacts changes to the process for conducting \nsweeps, however, the fundamentals of the policy have remained the same across each revision.  \nEach version of the DHS Sweeps Policy has been facially inadequate and unlawful. \n70.  While the DHS Sweeps Policy sets forth the processes to be followed by DHS and \nits partner agencies when conducting sweeps, in practice, the City has consistently failed, and \ncontinues to fail, to comply with this policy in various ways.  In addition, the City has a persistent \nand widespread practice and custom of conducting sweeps in ways that are both unconstitutional \nand which deviate from the written policy.  The ways in which the City has carried out sweeps in \npractice, and importantly the way in which it has violated the legal and constitutional rights of \nhomeless New Yorkers, have remained materially the same across  \n  1 9   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 20 of 71\neach iteration of the written policy.  The DHS Sweeps Policy, related policies and procedures of \npartner agencies, and the Cityโs widespread practices and customs during sweeps collectively \nconstitute the de facto sweeps policy at issue in this case. \nA.  Pre-Sweep, Including Notice Requirements  \n71.  According to the DHS Sweeps Policy, the DHS Joint Command Center (โJCCโ) \ncoordinates the interagency response to reports of homeless individuals residing in public, which \nthe City describes as โrequests to assess areas that may be hotspots, pop-ups, or encampments.โ  \nA key source of these โrequests to assessโ are 311 reports, however, some reports are made directly \nto the JCC via phone or email.   \n72.  Under the current policy, the NYPD makes the final determination as to whether a \nsite should be swept. \n73.  The  DHS  Sweeps  Policy  dictates  that,  unless  it  is  an  โemergency  cleanup,โ \nhomeless residents are to be given written notice in advance of the sweep.  According to the policy, \nsweeps typically take place 48 to 96 hours after they are scheduled for โcleanup.โ In the 2024 \nrevisions to the policy, it notes that the date the notice is posted and the date when the cleanup will \ncommence must be at least 14 days apart. It is not clear how this relates to the 48 to 96 hoursโ \nnotice set out in the same policy. \n74.  The City routinely does not provide adequate, timely notice to homeless residents \nprior to a sweep when following the written policy and when it deviates from the policy. \n75.  As illustrated through the experiences of the individual Plaintiffs, referenced below, \nthe City does not post notices 14 days prior to a scheduled sweep. Homeless residents are often \ngiven significantly less than 96 hoursโ notice before a sweep takes placeโit is very common for \nthe City to post a notice the day prior to a sweep.  Other times, a sweeps team will arrive on a date \nother than the date specified in the notice.  In many cases, as has been the case for each of the \n  2 0   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 21 of 71\nindividual Plaintiffs, people receive no notice at all. \n76.  The policy instructs outreach teams to distribute copies of notices to anyone present \nand post them in visible locations at the site assigned to be swept as part of a โstandard cleanup.โ \n77.  The standard form notice provided by the City informs homeless residents that there \nwill be a โclean-upโ of the site, instructs people to remove their belongings, notifies them that \nโitems of readily apparent value or containing personal identifying information may be stored for \nsafekeeping by the city,โ and states that if residents are not present at the sweep any remaining \nbelongings will be disposed of.  It also notifies residents of the process for self-referring to \ncongregate shelter and applying for an HRA storage grant.  The notice does not offer information \non what takes place during a โcleanup,โ nor does it advise residents of the risk that their property \nmay be disposed of even if they are present at the sweep.  The notice does not state the basis for \nthe sweep or provide a legal or administrative mechanism for residents to contest the sweep. \n78.  Because sweeps notices instruct homeless residents to remove their belongings, and \nby extension, themselves, from their sites, this causes some homeless residents to leave their sites \nprematurely  after  receiving  a  sweeps  notice  to  avoid  losing  their  belongings  and/or  being \nthreatened with arrest, as alleged by both Plaintiff Damian Voorhees and Plaintiff Bethany Hine. \n79.  Sweep notices notify residents of the date when a sweep will occur but do not state \nan approximate time, so residents do not know at what point during the day a sweep will take \nplace.  Not infrequently, even when the date of a sweep is specified on a notice, the sweeps team \narrive on a date other than that specified.  This happened, for example, to Plaintiff Antonia Hayes, \non or around May 1, 2024, when the City swept her and her belongings one day prior to the \nscheduled sweep date, as alleged in further detail below.  Upon information and belief, the failure \nto notify residents of an approximate time and accurate date causes residents to miss appointments, \n  2 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 22 of 71\nsuch as medical appointments or court dates, in order to protect their belongings from being \nunlawfully seized and destroyed by the City, which can have detrimental medical and legal \nconsequences. Alternatively, some homeless residents have no choice but to leave their belongings \nunattended and risk the City unlawfully seizing their belongings in their temporary absence. \n80.  The DHS Sweeps Policy instructs outreach teams to post notices โwith both sides \nshowing to help people get the information in their preferred language.โ On occasion, outreach \nteams will post notices in both English and Spanish, however, they rarely make attempts to confirm \nthe languages spoken by residents at a site scheduled to be swept. Further, the City does not appear \nto post sweeps notices that have been translated into languages other than English and Spanish \nand, upon information and belief, does not offer interpretation services at sweeps. \n81.  Additionally, the DHS Sweeps Policy authorizes the City to conduct a sweep the \nsame day with minimal to no prior notice if it is designated an โemergency cleanup.โ  The policy \ncontains a very broad list of circumstances that constitute an โemergencyโ for notice purposes, \nwhich includes the existence of an encampment in a โhigh-traffic areaโ and where a service request \nis made by โCommissioner-level City official or above.โ  Terms like โhigh-traffic areaโ are not \ndefined anywhere in the policy, which gives agency representatives vast discretion in determining \nwhen to conduct no-notice โemergencyโ sweeps. \n82.  As experienced by each of the Individual Plaintiffs on many occasions, and as \nalleged in further detail below, the City carries out a high volume of โemergencyโ sweeps without \nproviding any advance notice.  As alleged by Plaintiff Trese Chapman, for example, the Cityโs \nfailure to provide proper notice meant that she could not attend to important appointments, like \nreplacing her social security card, due to the risk they would seize her belongings while temporarily \nabsent from her site. \n  2 2   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 23 of 71\n83.  The policy also states that, before a site is swept, JCC will dispatch outreach teams \nto make offers of services to โtalk to clients about their options and answer questions.โ \n84.  Upon information and belief, outreach teams often do not visit sites in advance of \nsweeps and, to the extent they do, they only do so to post sweeps notices.  As alleged by the \nindividual plaintiffs, they very rarely engage with homeless residents, much less answer any \nquestions about the nature or reason for the sweep or give them meaningful information about \nhousing or other services.  \nB.  During Sweeps \n85.  At the commencement of a sweep, the DHS Sweeps Policy instructs sweeps teams \nto offer social services to residents, explain the โcleanupโ process, and notify them to retain \nโimportant documents and anything valuable because things left behind may be discarded.โ  The \npolicy states that DSNY commences the โcleanupโ after residents leave the site and disposes of \nany remaining property. \n86.  According to the policy, DHS instructs homeless residents to leave their site.  They \nmust โgive occupants a reasonable amount of time to leave the immediate area and take their \nproperty.โ \n87.  The policy sets out a โproperty safeguarding and voucheringโ system for items that \nare deemed โeligible personal propertyโ and stipulates that โDHS must supply free temporary \nstorage for eligible items for 90 days from a personโs request.โ \n88.  The policy contains a list of โproperty eligible for storage,โ which includes personal \npapers, prescription medication, jewelry, eyeglasses, medical equipment, backpacks, suitcases, \nfunctional electronics, tents, functional bicycles, and โ[a]ny other item of reasonable value that an \noccupant asks to store and can be stored safely and transported.โ \n89.  The policy also contains a list of ineligible property that will not be stored, which \n  2 3   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 24 of 71\nincludes โnon-medical foods or liquids of any kind, perishable or otherwise,โ โfurniture/small \nappliances,โ โmattresses,โ โshopping carts,โ and โvisibly contaminated property.โ  The policy \nstates that locked containers may be stored at the agencyโs discretion.  Under the written policy, \nDSNY will dispose of ineligible property on DHSโ instruction. \n90.  The DHS Sweeps Policy sets out a process by which DHS must voucher and store \npeopleโs personal belongings, including inventorying eligible property, photographing it, and \nsealing it in a labeled container provided by DHS.  According to the policy, residents who elect to \nstore property with DHS will be given a voucher containing the details of their stored property and \nhow to retrieve it. \n91.  The retrieval information on the sample voucher annexed to the policy dictates that \nhomeless residents must call the JCC to coordinate pick up, appear in person to collect their \nproperty, and present proper identification at the time of pick up.  This is impractical for many \nstreet  homeless  New  Yorkers  as  they  often  do  not  have  working  phones  and/or  proper \nidentification.  Neither the policy nor the sample voucher states where the property is stored so \nproperty owners can only locate their property by calling the JCC.  The policy also suggests that \nproperty owners must identity the items in storage before DHS will return it to them.  After 90 \ndays, DHS will discard any property that hasnโt been retrieved without further notice.  The policy \ndoes not appear to allow property owners to periodically access their belongings while keeping \nthem in storage. \n92.  In practice, as illustrated through the experiences of the individual Plaintiffs, once \na sweep team arrives, they often do not give residents a reasonable opportunity to gather their \nbelongings as instructed by the DHS Sweeps Policy.  Instead, City agencies simply force homeless \nresidents to leave their sites and proceed to indiscriminately throw their belongings into a \n  2 4   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 25 of 71\nsanitation truck, sometimes within minutes of their arrival. \n93.  Most of the time, as consistently alleged by all of the individual Plaintiffs, people \nare instructed to โtake what they can carryโ in a single trip before City workers begin seizing their \nremaining belongings.  The City will often not permit others to assist in transporting peopleโs \nbelongings and will prevent people from carrying their property away in multiple trips.  \n94.  Other times, the City wonโt allow people to take any of their belongings with them \nand/or they restrict the type of belongings that people are permitted to carry, instead disposing of \nthose belongings by throwing them in a sanitation truck.  As alleged by Plaintiff Voorhees, for \nexample, the City prevented him from taking several items, including a sleeping mat and foam \nmattress with him as he was forced to leave his site during a sweep on or around October 8, 2024.  \nAs alleged by the individual Plaintiffs, sweeps teams generally do not attempt to distinguish \nbetween homeless residentsโ personal property and actual trash. \n95.  As alleged by each of the individual Plaintiffs below, the City routinely seizes and \ndestroys life-sustaining belongings such as warm clothing, bedding, personal documentation, \nmedications, tarpaulins, and other valuables, making it significantly harder for them to survive \noutdoors. \n96.  The City does not โuse best efforts to retain and voucher occupantsโ eligible \npersonal property for temporary storageโ or โmake every effortโ to explain the storage and \nvouchering process as instructed by the DHS Sweeps Policy.  The City neither routinely offers to \nstore nor actually stores and vouchers peopleโs personal belongings when conducting sweeps.  The \nCity has not properly implemented the storage and property vouchering procedure as set out in the \nDHS Sweeps Policy.  As alleged by the individual Plaintiffs, all of whom have experienced dozens \nof sweeps, the City has not once stored their personal belongings during a sweep. \n  2 5   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 26 of 71\n97.  If a homeless resident is not present during a sweep, DHS is only required by the \nDHS Sweeps Policy to store eligible property if the property is โidentifiableโ (i.e., it has a name \nthat can be used to label such property, and they must make โreasonable effortsโ to identify eligible \nproperty for storage).  โReasonable effortsโ do not include opening sealed or opaque containers.  \nSweeps teams are instructed to post a notice containing information about where personal property \nis being stored and the date by which DHS will dispose of unclaimed property. \n98.  In practice, this never occurs.  As alleged by Plaintiff Ventura, Plaintiff Voorhees, \nPlaintiff Hine, and Plaintiff Hayes, all of whom experienced sweeps while physically away from \ntheir sites, the City will summarily dispose of the belongings of homeless residents who are absent \nfrom their sites and leave.  Sweeps teams do not provide any notification to absent residents as set \nout in the policy nor do they take steps to safeguard or store items that appear to be the personal \nproperty of homeless residents. \n99.  As  alleged  by  the  individual  Plaintiffs,  the  Cityโgenerally  through  NYPD \nofficersโforcibly displaces homeless residents when conducting sweeps.  They tell people that \nthey are required to leave the area and, in some cases, they inform residents that unless they \npermanently relocate, they will be repeatedly swept until they do so. \n100.  The NYPD Homeless Encampment Guidelines specify that the NYPDโs primary \nresponsibility at sweeps is โmaintaining site security.โ Typically, it is NYPD officers who force \nhomeless residents to leave their site and prevent them from returning. \n101.  As alleged by the individual plaintiffs, the City also does not offer assistance to \nhomeless residents with applications for HRA storage grants during sweeps, which are generally \nrequired to be done either online or in person.  This is a lengthy and complicated process that often \ntakes as long as 30 days and, if not done in person, typically requires a working phone with internet \n  2 6   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 27 of 71\naccess and active phone service, which not all homeless residents have consistent access to.  \nApplying for a storage grant in person at an HRA benefits access center also poses significant \nlogistical problems because many homeless residents cannot leave their belongings unattended for \nlong periods. Individuals typically canโt make appointments in advance and so may experience \nlong wait times. \n102.  In the event that a homeless resident is able to place certain items in storage, that \ndoes not address the fact that homeless residents need many of the items that are permanently \nseized during sweeps to survive outside. \nC.  Post-Sweeps \n103.  The City does not, and currently cannot, provide any post-deprivation mechanism \nfor reclaiming personal property that they seize because they destroy peopleโs personal belongings \nby throwing them in the back of a sanitation truck and compacting them. \n104.  The City does not offer homeless residents compensation or a mechanism for \nseeking compensation for their personal property that is seized and destroyed by the City. \n105.  The DHS Sweeps Policy instructs sweeps and outreach teams to โtake steps to \nprevent former occupants or other people from returning and reestablishing the encampment.โ \n106.  Upon information and belief, agency representatives, including NYPD officers, \nwill sometimes return to canvass a site and move street homeless residents along after a sweep.  \nAs alleged by the individual Plaintiffs, NYPD officers will also physically remain at the site to \nprevent residents from returning.  For example, NYPD officers remained at Mr. Bethel and Ms. \nChapmanโs site after a sweep on or around June 13, 2024.  In other cases, data produced by DSS \nand DSNY shows that they will conduct repeated sweeps over the course of a few days or weeks \nto force street homeless residents to permanently relocate. \n  2 7   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 28 of 71\nD.  Perennial Encampments \n107.  The  DHS  Sweeps  Policy  contains  specific  rules  for  conducting  sweeps  of \nโperennial encampments.โ A โperennial encampmentโ is defined as a โsite prone to recurring \nencampment establishment.โ This determination is based on โobservation of multiple instances of \nreestablished encampments at the same location within a 30- day period from the last cleanup; or \nobservation  of  a  subsequent  encampment  within  a  250-foot  radius  of a  previously  cleaned \nencampment within a 30- day period.โ \n108.  The policy states that to prevent the reestablishment of encampments, it will \nprovide โextended public notificationโฆ for up to 14 days prior to the cleanup,โ deploy outreach \nteams, conduct sweeps within less than 14 days if there is an โimminent risk to public health, \nsafety, or security,โ perform โextended cleanup of the site at the same location or the surrounding \n250-foot proximity where an encampment is re-established during a 30-day period,โ and prevent \ntrespassing โwithin their authority and discretion.โ \nIII.  Sweeps Do Not Advance Legitimate Governmental Objectives \n109.  The  DHS  Sweeps  Policy  states  that  the  sweeps  aim  to  โassess  and  provide \ncompassionate, resource-intensive outreach to help unsheltered people access social services, i.e., \nshelter, financial support, or help with health and mental health issues and substance use/abuse \nissuesโ and โclear temporary physical structures โฆ in public spaces not meant for people to live.โ \n110.  The 2024 revision to the DHS Sweeps Policy adds a third goal, which is to โsupply \nlimited, temporary storage for eligible personal items removed from encampment sites and stored \nsafely for up to 90 days.โ As stated above, the City does not in practice routinely provide temporary \nstorage for peopleโs personal belongings. \n111.  Although not listed as a specific goal of the sweeps, the introduction to the policy \nalso states that sweeps are performed to โreduce health and safety risks from garbage, debris, \n  2 8   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 29 of 71\nhazardous materials, and other unsanitary conditions.โ \n112.  In reality, sweeps do not advance these goals and there is no correlation between \nthe unconstitutional conduct the City engages in during sweeps and the stated objectives of sweeps. \nA.  Sweeps Operations Do Not Connect Homeless New Yorkers with Important \nSocial Services, Including Housing \n113.  Contrary to its stated goal of providing aid to homeless New Yorkers by connecting \nthem to social services and helping them access emergency shelter and permanent housing, sweeps \nrarely result in connecting homeless people with the services they need for at least four reasons.  \nFirst, sweeps are not carried out in a way that is designed to achieve this goal.  Second, sweeps \nactually make it more difficult for homeless people to access services.  Third, the City has access \nto evidence that sweeps are ineffective as a vehicle for connecting people with shelter and housing.  \nAnd fourth, the City engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the goal of service provision, \nwhich casts serious doubt on the veracity of this as a governmental objective. \n114.  There is no rational relationship between the behavior of City agencies during \nsweeps and the goal of connecting homeless New Yorkers to services like emergency shelter and \npermanent housing.  To the contrary, there is a fundamental disconnect between taking someoneโs \nbelongings and/or displacing them from sites where they have sought shelter and increasing their \naccess to services.  Accordingly, it is clear that sweeps are not designed to โhelp unsheltered people \naccess social services.โ \n115.  Perversely, sweeps actually make it harder for homeless New Yorkers to access \nservices because the City destroys vital documentation and personal identification required for \npermanent housing placements, including apartments obtained through the Department of Housing \nPreservation and Development (โHPDโ), apartments obtained using CityFHEPS vouchers, and \nsupportive housing, some of the primary housing programs available to homeless New Yorkers.  \n  2 9   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 30 of 71\nPlaintiffs and other homeless New Yorkers have had Electronic Benefit Transfer (โEBTโ) cards, \nbirth certificates, social security cards, driverโs licenses, passports, State identification cards, and \nother personal documentation seized and destroyed during sweeps. \n116.  By continuously throwing away street homeless peoplesโ life-sustaining belongings \nand displacing them from their sites, sweeps have led to a total breakdown of trust between \nhomeless New Yorkers and outreach workers, such that connecting them with services becomes \nmore difficult.37 \n117.  Sweeps also make it difficult for homeless people to stay connected to outreach \nteams who can facilitate access to low-barrier shelter placements because the City forces them to \nconstantly relocate.  This also prevents outreach teams from ascertaining residentsโ long-term \nchronic homelessness, which significantly reduces the likelihood that street outreach teams will \noffer them safe haven and stabilization beds as they typically prioritize individuals they see \nrepeatedly.  In fact, DHS recently issued a new policy restricting access to safe haven and \nstabilization  beds  to  individualsโ  who  have  more  than  six  months  of  documented  street \nhomelessness.  It also impedes homeless residentsโ ability to get assigned to an outreach case load, \nwhich can give them access to permanent housing support and is an eligibility requirement for a \nCityFHEPS voucher. \n118.  The City has access to clear and convincing evidence that sweeps do not achieve \nthe goal of connecting homeless people with services.  An audit performed by the New York City \n \n37 The New York City Comptrollerโs Office published a policy report in June 2023 to \naccompany  the  Comptrollerโs  Sweeps  Audit  (โComptrollerโs  Policy  Reportโ).    See  NYC \nComptroller, Housing First: A Proved Approach to Dramatically Reduce Street Homelessness \n(June  2023)  7,  https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Brief-Report_Housing-\nFirst.pdf (โThe sweeps, which may result in peopleโs belongings being thrown away, including \nmedication and personally valuable items, have eroded trust between those living unsheltered on \nthe street and City workers and nonprofit outreach staff.โ). \n  3 0   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 31 of 71\nComptroller assessing DHSโ role in sweeps of homeless encampments (โComptrollerโs Sweeps \nAuditโ), released in June 2023, found that DHS had โlimited successโ in facilitating shelter \nplacements for homeless individuals subject to sweeps.  Of the 2,308 homeless individuals present \nat sweeps during an eight month period between March 21, 2022, and November 30, 2022, 119โ\nroughly 5%โaccepted temporary shelter placement, 29 immediately left the shelter without \nspending a single night, and only three obtained permanent housing.38 \n119.  In addition, the City conducts itself in a manner that is inconsistent with the goal of \nfacilitating access to services.  The Comptrollerโs Sweeps Audit found that DHS does not \nadequately track its outreach activity at sweeps in that it does not maintain records of the outreach \nservices it offers to homeless residents.  In fact, the only data captured by DHS during the relevant \neight-month period was the number of people present at a site being swept and the details of \nindividuals who accepted shelter placements.39  \n120.  Accordingly, outreach teams had no understanding of whether the people being \nswept required services, whether they have rejected service offers in the past or why, and whether \ntheir service needs had been assessed. \n121.  As alleged by the individual Plaintiffs, representatives of DHS never make offers \nof permanent housing to street homeless New Yorkers during sweeps.  Even if a homeless resident \nis offered and accepts placement in a shelter at a sweep, they are transported or directed to a drop-\nin center, which does not have sleeping facilities. There they may wait for days before being \noffered a bed in a congregate shelter, a type of shelter accommodation that lacks privacy and is \n \n38 Maura  Hayes-Chaffe,  Audit  of the  Department  of  Homeless  Servicesโ  Role  in  the \nโCleanupsโ  of  Homeless  Encampments,  NYC  Comptroller  (June  28,  2023)  7,  https://\ncomptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/ME23_059A.pdf. \n39 Hayes-Chaffe, supra n. 38, at 9โ10. \n  3 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 32 of 71\nnotoriously unsafe. \n122.  Accordingly, it is clear that sweeps do not facilitate access to housing or other \nimportant social services for homeless New Yorkers. \nB.  The Cityโs Conduct at Sweeps is not Rationally Connected to its Stated Goals \nof Clearing Structures and Addressing Sanitation Conditions \n123.  The City purports to carry out sweeps for the purpose of clearing temporary \nphysical structures in public spaces and, as a secondary goal, to address sanitation conditions at \nsites where homeless people reside, which it has categorized as โencampments,โ โpop-ups,โ and \nโhotspots.โ  The City, however, primarily sweeps sites that do not feature structures of any kind \nand consistently disposes of personal property that does not constitute a structure and does not \npose a health or sanitation risk. \n124.  Crucially, the City carries out many sweeps of homeless sites that do not feature \nstructures of any kind, including tents.  Of the 2,154 sweeps carried out by the City and examined \nby the Comptrollerโs Office, only 161 sites were classified as โencampments,โ while 1,093 were \ndesignated as โpop-ups.โ40  While the City defines an encampment as a site with a โfixed or \ntemporary physical structure built or set up as a shelter or dwelling,โ pop-ups are defined by \nreference to a lack of โfixed comforts (e.g., furniture, standing structures, curtains, mattresses) \n125.  The City also summarily destroys items that are not creating an obstruction. Despite \nmany homeless residents, including all of the individual Plaintiffs, making sure to store their \nbelongings in a way that does not obstruct sidewalks or other public thoroughfares, they have \nnonetheless  experienced  the  seizure  and  destruction  of  these  belongings.  Plaintiff  Ventura, \nPlaintiff Hayes, and Plaintiff Hine, for example, were routinely swept when they did not have any \nphysical structures at their sites and were not obstructing the sidewalk with their belongings. \n \n40 Hayes-Chaffe, supra n.38 at 5. \n  3 2   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 33 of 71\n126.  In addition, as alleged by the individual Plaintiffs, the City routinely sweeps sites \nwhere there are no health and safety hazards.  The City generally does not distinguish between \npeopleโs personal property and actual trash that has accumulated when disposing of items during \na sweep.  Sweeps teams invariably dispose of everything remaining at a site regardless of whether \nit carries sanitation risks. \n127.  UJC-SNP has repeatedly replaced homeless residentsโ personal belongings such as \nprotective coverings, sleeping cots, umbrellas, bedding, art supplies, and clothing that the City has \nseized and destroyed during a sweep, none of which pose a health and safety risk.  Then, in \nsubsequent sweeps, the City has again seized and destroyed those items. \n128.  The  Cityโs  unconstitutional  behavior  during  sweeps  cannot  be  justified  by \nsanitation-related goals because there is a significant disjunction between addressing sanitation \nconditions and disposing of personal property that does not pose public health concerns. \n129.  Ultimately, the Cityโs conduct at sweeps does not bear any relation to the Cityโs \nstated goals of dismantling illegal structures and addressing sanitation conditions. \nIV.  Prior Notice \n130.  The City is well aware of the fact that sweeps teams across the City are summarily \ndisposing of street homeless New Yorkersโ personal property without a warrant and without due \nprocess of law and displacing homeless New Yorkers from their sites. \n131.  There have been numerous media reports regarding the harmful practices that take \nplace during sweeps, including peopleโs belongings being thrown into the back of sanitation trucks \nwithout any means of tracing their whereabouts.41 \n \n41 See, e.g., Jeff Coltin, New York City Workers Keep Throwing Out Homeless Peopleโs \nBelongings, City & State (Apr. 5, 2022), https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/04/new-\nyork-city-workers-keep-throwing-out-homeless-peoples-belongings/364018; Leonard Greene et \n \n  3 3   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 34 of 71\n132.  As early as 2016, the City has been fielding legal complaints from homeless New \nYorkers about the erroneous deprivation of their belongings during sweeps.  In 2016, three street \nhomeless individuals filed notices of claim against the City of New York alleging an inter-agency \nsweeps team had kicked them awake in the early hours of the morning in October 2015 and forcibly \ndisposed of their belongings.42  The City made settlement offers to these three men to compensate \nthem for the property that the City had unlawfully seized and destroyed. \n133.  Plaintiff UJC-SNP has engaged in written and verbal communications with DHS in \nwhich it has notified DHS of the Cityโs harmful conduct during sweeps. \n134.  UJC-SNP staff are also physically present at some sweeps and notify agency \nrepresentatives of the need to safeguard residentsโ personal belongings due to the likelihood that \nthe City will dispose of their property. \n135.  Given the widespread non-compliance with many aspects of the DHS Sweeps \nPolicy, the City has also clearly failed to properly train staff on how to comply with its own \npolicies. \nPLAINTIFFSโ EXPERIENCES \nI.

Defendantsโ wrongful action in conducting sweeps frustrates UJC-SNPโs core \n \nal., Critics Say Mayor Adams Didnโt Learn Lesson From 9,000 Homeless Encampments Torn \nDown by de Blasio, NY Daily News (Mar. 31, 2022), https://www.nydailynews.com/2022/03/31/\ncritics-say-mayor-adams-didnt-learn-lesson-from-9000-homeless-encampments-torn-down-by-\nde-blasio. \n42 NYCLU, NYCLU Settlement: City to Compensate Homeless People for Destroyed \nPossessions  (Jan.  4,  2017),  https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/nyclu-settlement-city-\ncompensate-homeless-people-destroyed-possessions. \n  3 4   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 35 of 71\nmission to ensure access to safe and affordable housing and essential benefits for all, strengthen \nthe social safety net, and advocate for government policies and practices that respect the dignity \nof homeless and low-income New Yorkers. \n138.  UJC-SNP has an interdisciplinary benefits and homeless advocacy team composed \nof advocates, outreach workers, organizers, social workers, an attorney, and a law fellow.  As such, \nit provides a wide range of services to homeless New Yorkers. \n139.  As  a  result  of  the  Cityโs  homeless  sweeps,  UJC-SNP  has  had  to  divert \norganizational resources away  from securing permanent housing, public benefits, and other \nservices for homeless individuals towards offering assistance to people who experience sweeps \nby: advising homeless residents of their rights during sweeps, attending sweeps in-person to \nprevent property loss, using organizational funds to replace items that were seized during a sweep, \nand assisting residents with replacing personal identification and other documents that they need \nto apply for housing or obtain public benefits. \n140.  Sweeps also have a disruptive impact on UJC-SNPโs ability to facilitate access to \nhousing subsidies, such as CityFHEPS, complete Homeless Housing Applications, and advocate \non public benefits issues for homeless New Yorkers because the City consistently returns to sites \nwhere UJC-SNPโs clients reside, destroys their belongings, and forces them to relocate.  This \nmakes it extremely difficult for UJC-SNP to maintain contact and stable communication with their \nstreet homeless clients and negatively affects UJC-SNP's ability to provide them with a range of \nservices. \n141.  Sweeps have a dual effect of redirecting the attention of UJC-SNP clients away \nfrom obtaining permanent housing and other critical services toward their continued survival on \nthe  street,  as  well  as  creating  administrative  barriers  due  to  the  loss  of  crucial  personal \n  3 5   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 36 of 71\ndocumentation  required  to  submit  housing  applications.  This  results  in  the  expenditure  of \nadditional organizational resources on case management and advocacy services for each given \ncase where the client is a homeless resident experiencing sweeps. \n142.  UJC-SNP staff have worked with more than 100 homeless New Yorkers who have \nexperienced sweeps. Between April 2021 and October 2024, UJC-SNP staff members attended \nmore than 90 sweeps and utilized roughly $17,449.58 in client assistance funds to cover storage \ncosts for homeless individuals facing the loss of their belongings in sweeps. UJC-SNP also directed \nroughly $1055.48 in discretionary homeless funds to replace personal belongings seized during a \nsweep. \n143.  UJC-SNP staff members also spend many hours assisting homeless clients with \naddressing the consequences of sweeps, including by helping clients submit applications to replace \npersonal documents, obtaining HRA storage grants, communicating with street medical teams to \nreplace medications or prescriptions that were lost, and purchasing bedding, clothing, protective \ncoverings, and other life-sustaining belongings. \n144.  Because UJC-SNP clients are often repeatedly swept, they have lost replacement \nitems that UJC-SNP purchased for them in subsequent sweeps, which means that UJC-SNP staff \nmembers must spend time and additional funds replacing those items again.  These items include \nsleeping cots, bedding, protective coverings, clothing, art supplies, and umbrellas, none of which \nare items that cause sanitation concerns. \n145.  UJC-SNP  participates  in  coalition  groups  and  liaises  with  other  nonprofit \norganizations regarding the impact of sweeps on New York Cityโs homeless population. \n146.  UJC-SNP has spent time and resources developing know-your-rights material to \ndistribute to homeless residents who experience sweeps. \n  3 6   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 37 of 71\n147.  UJC-SNP also offers feedback and is involved in the drafting of legislation intended \nto combat the adverse effects of sweeps on street homeless New Yorkers.  This includes Intro. \n1153, a bill passed by the New York City Council in December 2023 that imposes public reporting \nobligations on New York City agencies regarding sweeps. \n148.  Because sweeps require a multifaceted response, UJC-SNP has dedicated a broad \nrange of resources in the form of organizing, advocacy, legal services, material aid, and social \nwork support to address the impact that sweeps have on its street homeless clients.  This inevitably \ndetracts from its ability to dedicate those resources to other issues impacting its client base. \n149.  Many UJC-SNP staff members work on public benefits as well as homeless \nadvocacy cases.  Working with street homeless clients who experience sweeps can be more labor-\nintensive than other categories of clients, which means that advocates and social workers may have \nto take on a lower caseload to account for this and are therefore able to assist fewer clients overall. \n150.  UJC-SNPโs focus on sweeps-related work also means that its staff members have \nless bandwidth to concentrate on other areas that its clients and members would like to prioritize. \nII.  Gerald Bethel and Trese Chapman \n151.  Plaintiffs Gerald Bethel and Trese Chapman have been homeless in New York City \nsince in or around July 2023, after being forced to leave their apartment due to it being an illegal \nsublet, a fact previously unbeknown to them.  Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman have been in a \nrelationship for roughly 11 years. \n152.  They began residing at their site in Manhattan near Union Square in or around \nSeptember 2023. \n153.  Their site was located under some construction scaffolding along the side of a \nvacant building and their belongings were stored along the side of the building in a neat and tightly \ncontained manner.  None of their belongings were obstructing the sidewalk or preventing the flow \n  3 7   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 38 of 71\nof foot traffic in any way, and Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman made every effort to ensure their site \nwas free of trash. \n154.  Between September and December 2023, they experienced at least six sweeps, \nincluding on or around September 18, September 25, October 2, October 4, October 10, and \nNovember 13. \n155.  Starting in January 2024, the City began conducting weekly sweeps of their site, \nincluding but not limited to, on or around January 4, January 10, January 22, January 31, February \n5, February 28, March 7, March 18, March 25, April 2, April 9, April 15, April 24, May 2, May \n13, May 20, June 3, and June 13.  These sweeps continued to occur on an almost weekly basis \nfrom mid-June through October 2024. \n156.  Between in or around January and March 2024, the City would typically provide \nadvance written notice prior to a sweep.  They would typically provide anywhere from 12 hoursโ \nto 48 hoursโ notice. \n157.  The notices listed a date but no time so neither Mr. Bethel nor Ms. Chapman knew \nwhen they needed to wake up and/or start preparing for the sweep. \n158.  Outreach workers would often post notices while they were sleeping.  To the extent \nthey posted notices when they were awake, DHS workers did not offer services or provide any \ndetails regarding the upcoming sweep. \n159.  Between March and June 2024, the City started to perform some of these sweeps \nwithout prior notice. \n160.  In or around June 2024, the City started to consistently conduct sweeps without any \nprior notice. \n161.  City representatives informed Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman that they no longer \n  3 8   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 39 of 71\nneeded to provide notice because they were what they deemed โchronically homeless.โ  This meant \nthat they did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare for the sweep or take steps to safeguard \ntheir personal belongings. \n162.  The sweeps teams would be typically composed of three DSNY workers, including \na DSNY supervisor, two to three NYPD officers, and one or two DHS workers. \n163.  Starting in or around June 2024, the sweeps team adopted a more aggressive \napproach when conducting sweeps and rushed them to pack up their belongings and relocate. \n164.  When the sweeps team arrived at their site, which could be anywhere between 8am \nand 12pm, the NYPD officers would tell Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman to leave their site and take \nonly what they could carry in one trip. \n165.  Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman complied with the NYPD officersโ orders to leave \ntheir site because they understood that if they did not, they would physically force them to move \nor they would throw out all of their belongings without giving them an opportunity to safeguard \ntheir property. \n166.  Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman understood that the City would throw out their \nproperty if they didnโt leave because, on one occasion, they witnessed another homeless individual \nrefuse to relocate during a sweep and the City seized all of his belongings and disposed of them in \na sanitation truck. \n167.  DHS never offered to store or voucher Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapmanโs belongings; \nnor did they ever offer to assist with applying for an HRA storage grant.  In fact, the City expressly \nrefused to store their belongings after Ms. Chapman inquired about it. \n168.  On or around June 13, 2024, the City carried out a no-notice sweep of their site on \nMs.  Chapmanโs  birthday.    The  sweeps  team  consisted  of  two  NYPD  officers,  DHS \n  3 9   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 40 of 71\nrepresentative(s), and DSNY workers.  The NYPD officers told Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman that \nthey needed to leave their site and could only take what they could carry in one trip.  Mr. Bethel \nand Ms. Chapman could not carry all their belongings in a single trip and were informed that their \nremaining belongings would be disposed of.  The City seized clothing, shoes, blankets, personal \neffects such as family photographs, books, notebooks, hygiene products, and jewelry and disposed \nof them by throwing them in the back of a sanitation truck and operating the compactor.  After the \nCity completed the sweep, two NYPD officers remained across the road from their site for \napproximately 90 minutes.  Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman believed that if they returned to their \nsite, the NYPD would force them to move again so they relocated to another less sheltered site on \na windy street corner. \n169.  On or around August 30, 2024, the City conducted a no-notice sweep of Mr. Bethel \nand Ms. Chapman.  At the time, they had moved their belongings down the block from their usual \nsite while Ms. Chapman was charging her phone at a LinkNYC kiosk.  They stored their \nbelongings between the kiosk and edge of the sidewalk so they were not obstructing pedestrian \ntraffic.  After inquiring about why they needed to move, an NYPD officer informed them that Ms. \nChapman was blocking access to the LinkNYC kiosk, despite the fact that she was using it.  The \nsweeps team, composed of two NYPD officers, two DHS workers, and two DSNY workers, \ninformed them that they were conducting an โemergencyโ sweep and that they could only take \nwhat they could carry in one trip and leave.  They also refused to store any of Mr. Bethel or Ms. \nChapmanโs belongings, despite Ms. Chapman pointing out that DHS has an obligation to store \ntheir personal property.  They were permanently deprived of clothing, shoes, and hygiene products, \nwhich are particularly hard to replace because they are expensive and are not donated as frequently. \n170.  The sweeps of Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapmanโs sites escalated in the lead up to Labor \n  4 0   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 41 of 71\nDay 2024, when the City conducted three sweeps in the course of six days, on or around August \n28, August 30, and September 2, 2024.  The City only provided advance notice prior to the Labor \nDay sweep, which was posted roughly only 12 hours prior to the sweep. \n171.  The  City  carried  out  sweeps  of  Mr.  Bethel  and  Ms.  Chapmanโs  site  during \ninclement weather, including during heavy rain, and displaced them from their site, which was \nprotected by scaffolding offering some protection against the elements.  On multiple occasions, \nthe City forced Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman to move themselves and their belongings into the \nrain. \n172.  Being swept repeatedly by the City has been deeply traumatizing for Mr. Bethel.  \nMr. Bethel suffers from bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Constant sweeps have \ntriggered symptoms of his mental health conditions, caused him to feel severely depressed and \nimpeding his ability to function in the aftermath of a sweep. \n173.  Mr. Bethel has also been offered multiple jobs that he was unable to accept because \nhe could not leave Ms. Chapman alone at the site; this is in part because she was unable to carry \nall of their belongings if the City were to conduct a sweep. \n174.  Ms.  Chapman  also  has  diagnosed  bipolar  disorder  and  post-traumatic  stress \ndisorder.  Repeated sweeps have caused her to feel highly anxious and depressed.  Every time she \nsees a sanitation truck or NYPD sprinter van pass by, she feels severely distressed.  Sweeps, \nespecially โemergencyโ sweeps, also prevented her leaving their site and attending to important \npersonal matters, such as replacing her social security card. \n175.  The only services that DHS offered Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman during a sweep \nwere separate placements in congregate shelter, with no guarantee that they would be placed at \nshelters proximate to one another.  DHS repeatedly refused to offer them a joint shelter placement \n  4 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 42 of 71\nas they do not have a registered domestic partnership.  On a few occasions, DHS did offer them a \ncouplesโ placement in shelter on the condition that they register their domestic partnership within \nten days of entering shelter.  DHS made it very clear that they would not offer assistance in \nobtaining the identification documents needed to register their domestic partnership and that Mr. \nBethel and Ms. Chapman would lose their shelter placement if they were not able to comply with \nthis condition.  However, Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman are currently unable to register their \ndomestic partnership as Mr. Bethel does not currently have any form of identification, including \nhis birth certificate.  DHS refused to assist Mr. Bethel in replacing his birth certificate.  Accepting \nseparate shelter placements was not a viable option for Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman, who have \nbeen together for approximately 11 years. \n176.  Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman secured a couplesโ placement in a stabilization bed \nfacility through the persistent advocacy of UJC-SNP and entered their placement on October 16, \n2024.  \n177.  Due to the instability and precariousness of shelter placements, there is a substantial \nrisk that Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman will return to street homelessness in the near future.  They \nhave not yet been able to register their domestic partnership and have been told repeatedly by DHS \nthat they would not be permitted to maintain their couplesโ placement long-term if they could not \ndo so.  This means that there is a concrete chance that Mr. Bethel and Ms. Chapman will be forced \nback onto the street, where they will be subject to repeated sweeps involving the destruction of \ntheir personal belongings and forced displacement. \nIII.  Antonia Hayes \n178.  Plaintiff Antonia Hayes has been homeless for approximately ten years. She has \nresided in the West Village for the last four to five years and has since experienced at least 20 \nsweeps there. \n  4 2   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 43 of 71\n179.  Ms. Hayes often moves between sites within the West Village because she is swept \nfrom one site or subject to a police-initiated โmove alongโ order. \n180.  During  sweeps,  the  City  has  seized  and  destroyed  her  personal  belongings, \nincluding items that have enormous sentimental value and are irreplaceable, such as the ashes of \nher deceased father, daughter, and son, the death certificate of her deceased son, the birth \ncertificates of her children, and her personal artwork. \n181.  The City has also permanently deprived Ms. Hayes of several cell phones, a brand-\nnew laptop, clothing, shoes, and bedding. \n182.  The City has also forcibly taken Ms. Hayesโ personal identification documents, \nincluding her birth certificate, social security card, and New York State Identification card. She \nhas  not  been  able  to  replace  those  documents  and  currently  does  not  have  any  form  of \nidentification. \n183.  Not having photo identification has made it challenging for Ms. Hayes to access \nservices, including medical services. \n184.  The City has also summarily seized and destroyed Ms. Hayesโ Supplemental \nSecurity Income Direct Express card and Electronic Benefits Transfer (โEBTโ) card during a \nsweep. \n185.  Ms. Hayes uses her EBT card to access her public benefits. Because the City \ndisposed of her EBT card during a sweep, she could not access her SNAP benefits and had her \npublic assistance case closed.  She has been unable to purchase food while she is trying to replace \nher EBT card and reopen her case. \n186.  Of the many sweeps Ms. Hayes has experienced, over half have taken place without \nadvance written notice by the City. \n  4 3   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 44 of 71\n187.  When the City has provided advance written notice, they have typically provided \nbetween 12 to 24 hoursโ notice, and on a few occasions, up to four daysโ notice. \n188.  On at least one occasion, on or around May 1, 2024, the sweeps team performed a \nsweep on the day prior to the date indicated on the sweeps notice while Ms. Hayes was temporarily \nabsent from her site.  She returned to her site to find an interagency sweeps team disposing of her \nbelongings, despite her attempt to intervene and save her belongings. \n189.  In or around June 2024, representatives of the City informed Ms. Hayes that they \nwould likely be conducting no-notice sweeps with respect to her moving forward.  Repeated no-\nnotice sweeps and sweeps on short notice prevent her from taking steps to safeguard her personal \nbelongings. \n190.  Typically, during a sweep, the City instructs Ms. Hayes to take only what she can \ncarry in one trip.  At times, it is not possible for Ms. Hayes to transport all of her belongings in \none trip.  In those cases, the City rarely allows her to gather the remainder of her belongings in a \nsecond trip.  Instead, they dispose of them by throwing them in a sanitation truck. \n191.  Sweeps teams are typically composed of representatives from the New York City \nPolice  Department  (โNYPDโ),  Department  of  Homeless  Services  (โDHSโ),  and  either  the \nDepartment  of  Sanitation  (โDSNYโ)  or  Department  of  Parks  and  Recreation  (โParks \nDepartmentโ), depending on the specific location of her site. \n192.  On many occasions, Ms. Hayes has witnessed the City throw her belongings in the \nback of a sanitation truck and run the compactor, instantly destroying her personal property. \n193.  The City has never offered to store and/or voucher any of Ms. Hayesโ personal \nproperty. \n194.  The City has never offered Ms. Hayes any avenue for reclaiming belongings that \n  4 4   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 45 of 71\nthey have seized during a sweep as they have instantaneously destroyed her personal property. \n195.  During sweeps, the City often forces Ms. Hayes to leave her site while they conduct \nthe sweep by telling her she has to move along.  Typically, it is NYPD officers who enforce the \ninstruction to leave her site.  She often complies because she does not want to deal with a \nconfrontation with the police and risk being arrested. \n196.  The City has also swept Ms. Hayes during inclement weather, including snow, and \ndeprived her of survival items like warm clothing. \n197.  In May 2024 alone, the City swept Ms. Hayes and/or posted sweeps notices at her \nsite on at least four occasions at her sites in the West Village including, but not limited to, on or \naround May 1, May 16, May 20, and May 29, 2024.  Ms. Hayes also experienced at least 11 \nadditional sweeps in the months of June, July, August, and September 2024 including, but not \nlimited to, on or around June 5, June 10, June 26, early July, July 24, August 12, September 3, \nSeptember 17, October 22, October 24, and October 27, 2024. \n198.  The City has swept Ms. Hayes while she was physically unwell.  During a sweep \nin or around mid-May, the City conducted a no-notice sweep of Ms. Hayes while she had \npneumonia.  Due to physical weakness caused by her illness, Ms. Hayes was having difficulty \nmoving her belongings, and the City subsequently seized and destroyed a suitcase and shopping \ncart  full  of  her  personal  belongings  as  she  tried  in  vain  to  transport  them  from  her  site \nindependently. \n199.  The City has seized Ms. Hayesโ art supplies during a number of sweeps, including \na no-notice sweep at a park in the West Village on or around May 29, 2024 where the City seized \nand destroyed two sets of brand new acrylic paints and two canvasses Ms. Hayes was painting for \nan art gallery that sets aside space for art made by homeless individuals. \n  4 5   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 46 of 71\n200.  The summary destruction of Ms. Hayesโ art supplies has been devastating for Ms. \nHayes as she makes art to process her traumatic experiences residing on the street and to provide \nan emotional outlet. \n201.  Ms.  Hayes  experienced  several  no-notice  sweeps  during  July,  August,  and \nSeptember 2024 during which the City seized and destroyed her personal property, did not offer \nto store or otherwise safeguard her personal belongings, and displaced her from her site. \n202.  For example, in or around early July 2024, Ms. Hayes experienced a no-notice \nsweep in the early hours of the morning while it was raining.  During that sweep, the City seized \nmany of her belongings including shoes, clothing, hygiene products, cosmetics, and photos of her \nstillborn daughter.  Ms. Hayes witnessed the City throw those belongings into the back of a \nsanitation truck and run the compactor.  The City only allowed her to take what she could carry in \none trip and wouldnโt allow her to return for the remainder of her belongings.  They did not offer \nto store or voucher her belongings.  The sweeps team forced Ms. Hayes to leave her site under \nsome scaffolding where she had sought shelter while it was still raining. \n203.  During another sweep on or around August 12, 2024, the City seized and destroyed \nall of Ms. Hayes belongings while she was asleep at her site in a park, including clothing, a pair \nof sneakers, and a 24-pack of Crayola pencils that her UJC-SNP advocates had provided her to \nreplace art supplies she lost during a previous sweep in or around May 2024.  The City did not \nprovide advance notice of this sweep and did not leave any notification that a sweep had occurred \nand/or that they had taken her property. \n204.  In September and October 2024, Ms. Hayes experienced no-notice sweeps in the \npark involving only the Parks Department, including, but not limited to, on or around September \n3, September 17, October 22, and October 24, 2024.  During the September 3, 2024 sweep, the \n  4 6   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 47 of 71\nParks Department seized and destroyed Ms. Hayesโ clothing, shoes, bedding, and art supplies \nwhile  she  was  using  a  public  restroom.    During  the  September  17,  2024  sweep,  a  City \nrepresentative from the Parks Department grabbed Ms. Hayesโ and other residentsโ personal \nbelongings and threw these belongings in a sanitation bin on wheels, claiming that it was an \nโemergency cleanup.โ  Ms. Hayes experienced similar sweeps on or around October 22 and \nOctober 24, 2024, during which the Parks Department permanently deprived her of clothing, shoes, \nblankets, and art supplies without notice. \n205.  Being continuously swept by the City has been an immensely stressful experience \nfor Ms. Hayes as she is afraid they are going to keep returning, potentially without notice, to take \nwhat little belongings she has left. \nIV.  Bethany Hine \n206.  Plaintiff Bethany Hine has been street homeless in New York City for over six \nyears. \n207.  Ms. Hine is a transwoman and currently resides in the West Village.  She has \nexperienced dozens of sweeps, which occur at regular intervals. \n208.  Between July 2023 and July 2024, Ms. Hine experienced at least 29 sweeps and/or \nscheduled sweeps at her primary site, including but not limited to, the following dates in 2023: \nJuly 13, July 19, July 31, August 8, August 15, August 22, August 28, August 31, September 7, \nSeptember 13, September 20, September 27, October 16, October 23, November 7, November 13, \nand November 21; and the following dates in 2024: February 28, March 12, March 19, March 27, \nApril 9, April 22, May 2, May 13, May 20, June 17, August 15, and October 22. \n209.  Constant sweeps and sweeps notices have caused Ms. Hine to move between \nmultiple sites within the West Village and she has become increasingly nomadic to try to avoid \nthem. \n  4 7   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 48 of 71\n210.  The amount of belongings that Ms. Hine has with her at any one time varies, \nhowever, she typically stores her belongings in a few bags, sometimes placing them in a crate or \nother vessel, and positions them on the edge of the sidewalk so that they do not impede foot traffic.  \nShe does not generally have a structure at any of her sites and tries to pick up trash to keep her site \nclean and contained. \n211.  In recent months, Ms. Hine has been increasingly subjected to sweeps without any \nadvance notice, which means that she does not have an opportunity to pack up her belongings in \nadvance or know when she needs to be physically present at her site to avoid losing her property \nduring her temporary absence. \n212.  On the few occasions in 2024 when she has been given notice of an impending \nsweep, Ms. Hine has consistently received less than two full daysโ notice and sometimes less than \n24 hoursโ notice, which does not allow her a meaningful opportunity to find another safe location \nto move with her belongings. \n213.  Outreach workers do not typically engage with Ms. Hine when they post sweeps \nnotices as they usually do so when Ms. Hine is away from her site or asleep. \n214.  Ms. Hine often receives sweeps notices when she has very few belongings at her \nsite.  On August 13, 2024, for example, the City posted a notice for a sweep scheduled to take \nplace at her site on August 15, 2024.  At the time she received the notice, she was storing the \nmajority of her belongings in a small, compact cart on the edge of the sidewalk.  She was not \nobstructing the sidewalk or interrupting the flow of pedestrian traffic in any way. \n215.  The sweeps that Ms. Hine has experienced while present at her site have all been \nconducted in a very similar fashion. \n216.  City agents typically conducting Ms. Hineโs sweeps include two NYPD officers, \n  4 8   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 49 of 71\nhomeless outreach workers, and two to three sanitation workers. \n217.  During sweeps, the City instructs her to take what she can carry in a single trip and \nleave the area. \n218.  At times, Ms. Hine has been unable to transport her belongings in a single trip.  \nSometimes this is due to physical limitations, such as back pain.  The City, however, will not allow \nher to carry her personal property in multiple trips or allow others to help her carry items.  Instead, \nthey will dispose of everything that remains by throwing it in the back of a sanitation truck. \n219.  The  City  does  not  give  Ms.  Hine  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  relocate  her \nbelongings.  During a sweep in or around April or May 2024, the City conducted a sweep of Ms. \nHine without any prior notice and gave her less than five minutes to pack up and transport her \npersonal belongings.  Accordingly, the City seized and destroyed any belongings she wasnโt able \nto move in a single trip. \n220.  On or around October 22, 2024, an interagency sweeps team composed of two \nNYPD officers, one DHS representative, and DSNY workers approached Ms. Hine at her primary \nsite, told her they were conducting a sweep, and that she needed to relocate with her belongings.  \nThey had posted a sweep notice on a mailbox at her site in a way that was not visible to Ms. Hine \nand, accordingly, she did not see it prior to the sweep.  She had not packed her belongings in \nadvance and was unable to transport them all in a single trip.  When she returned to her site to \nretrieve her remaining belongings, the NYPD officers and/or DSNY workers had thrown them in \nthe back of the sanitation truck, including a jacket that she needed to stay warm.  She ultimately \nmanaged to retrieve her jacket from the garbage truck but the City permanently deprived her of \nother belongings, including other pieces of clothing and her hormones. \n221.  During  many  sweeps,  NYPD  officers  and  homeless  outreach  workers  have \n  4 9   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 50 of 71\nexplicitly restricted many personal belongings Ms. Hine wanted to bring to a new site, including \nfolding chairs and bedding such as blankets and pillows. \n222.  Ms. Hine has witnessed DSNY workers run the compactor on the spot, permanently \ndestroying her personal property. \n223.  The  City  has  forcibly  and  permanently  deprived  Ms.  Hine  of  her  personal \nbelongings  during  sweeps,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  clothing,  sterling  silver  jewelry, \nmedications, hormones, hygiene products, personal identification documents, bedding, pillows, \nblankets, a laptop, and an umbrella. \n224.  The City has never offered Ms. Hine storage or property vouchers for her personal \nproperty, even after Ms. Hine has explicitly requested this.  The City has also never offered to \nassist Ms. Hine with applying for an HRA storage grant. \n225.  NYPD officers instruct Ms. Hine to leave the area during sweeps.  On a few \noccasions, she has refused to leave her site and the City has disposed of all of her belongings.  She \nunderstands that if she does not move along during a sweep, she will lose all of her personal \nproperty, including the belongings she can carry with her. \n226.  At times, receiving sweeps notices and/or being swept has exposed Ms. Hine to \ndangerous situations because it forces her to relocate from her primary site, where she feels \nrelatively safe because it is in a public location, to areas where she is at risk of harm. \n227.  Being forcibly displaced from her site destabilizes Ms. Hineโs life by disrupting her \nsense of normalcy.  \n228.  Recently, Ms. Hine has experienced a large number of no-notice sweeps when she \nis physically away from her belongings.  She understands that it is a sweep because when she \nreturns to her site, every single one of her belongings is gone.  In these instances, the City does not \n  5 0   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 51 of 71\nleave notices at her site regarding the sweep or seizure of her property. On some occasions, she \nhas returned to her site to find a sweeps team throwing her belongings in the back of a sanitation \ntruck. \n229.  On one occasion, Ms. Hine returned to her site and witnessed DSNY workers \nthrowing a leather duster jacket that belonged to her deceased friend in a sanitation truck and was \nunable to retrieve it. \n230.  Ms. Hine has been swept multiple times in inclement weather, including heavy rain, \nand extreme cold.  On those occasions, the City has permanently deprived her of personal \nprotective items such as her warm clothing, jackets, umbrellas, and tarps. \n231.  The only services that Ms. Hine has been offered by the City during sweeps are \ngoing to hospitals or placements in congregate shelters. \n232.  Constant sweeps have caused Ms. Hine psychological harm in the form of panic \nattacks, acute anxiety, and severe emotional distress.  \nV.  Eduardo Ventura \n233.  Plaintiff Eduardo Ventura has been consistently homeless since in or around the \nend of 2020 and consistently street homeless since the Spring of 2022. \n234.  Mr. Ventura began experiencing regular sweeps beginning in or around May 2023 \nand very frequent sweeps in or around August 2023 at his sites in the East Village in Manhattan. \n235.  Mr. Ventura experienced at least eighteen sweeps and/or scheduled sweeps at two \ndifferent sites between August 2023 and December 2023: on or around August 8, August 16, \nAugust 28, September 5, September 12, September 19, September 23, September 26, September \n27, October 2, October 11, October 19, October 26, November 7, November 17, November 22, \nNovember 29, and December 7, 2023. \n236.  At each of his sites, Mr. Ventura stored his personal belongings in a few bags and/or \n  5 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 52 of 71\ncontainers and would position them on the edge of the sidewalk, at one of his sites, or against the \nside of a building, at his other site, so that they werenโt impeding the sidewalk. \n237.  During the first few months, the City usually provided Mr. Ventura with advance \nwritten notice of a sweep. \n238.  On average, he would receive 24 to 48 hoursโ advance notice.  He never received \nmore than 48 hoursโ notice of a sweep.  This did not give Mr. Ventura adequate time to find a safe \nlocation to relocate with his belongings. \n239.  Typically, Mr. Ventura would be approached at his site by an interagency sweeps \nteam, usually consisting of approximately two or three DHS employees, three DSNY employees, \nincluding a DSNY supervisor, and two to upward of ten NYPD officers. \n240.  The NYPD officers would verbally instruct him to take only what he could carry in \na single trip and leave the area. \n241.  Mr. Ventura would comply with the officersโ instructions to leave his site as he \nunderstood that if he did not, he would be arrested and/or the City would seize and destroy every \nsingle belonging he had at his site. \n242.  The City would not give Mr. Ventura a meaningful opportunity to pack up all of \nhis belongings before they began seizing items.  In the first few months, they would allow him to \nspend five to ten minutes packing up his belongings. However, after in or around August 2023 \nonward, they would make him leave the area almost immediately and would begin seizing any \nitems he couldnโt take with him within a couple minutes of arrival. \n243.  During each sweep, the City would invariably seize and unlawfully destroy Mr. \nVenturaโs personal property, including warm clothing, cell phones, blankets, items of sentimental \nvalue, and personal papers. \n  5 2   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 53 of 71\n244.  On many occasions, Mr. Ventura witnessed DSNY employees seize his personal \nbelongings and throw them in a sanitation truck.  Sometimes, he would see them run the compactor \nand crush his belongings, including bicycles. \n245.  Mr. Ventura would frequently assert ownership of the belongings that the City \npermanently destroyed and plead with the City not to dispose of his property.  The City, however, \nignored his verbal requests. \n246.  The City never offered Mr. Ventura storage for his belongings or vouchered his \nproperty, nor did it ever offer him assistance with securing permanent housing. \n247.  The only services that the City ever offered Mr. Ventura were transportation to a \nhospital or a congregate shelter placement. \n248.  The City also never provided a post-deprivation process for reclaiming his property \nor offered to compensate Mr. Ventura for the property that they destroyed. \n249.  On some occasions, after the sweeps team had concluded the sweep, several NYPD \nofficers would remain at Mr. Venturaโs site for up to thirty minutes, physically preventing him \nfrom returning. \n250.  Mr. Ventura also experienced sweeps without notice when he was absent from his \nsite, running errands, using the bathroom, or walking around the neighborhood.  He would return \nto his site and find everything gone, which is how he understood that a sweep had taken place.  At \nhis site, he would arrange his belongings in an organized and compact manner to indicate they \nbelonged to someone. \n251.  In or around the Summer of 2023, Mr. Ventura experienced a sweep during which \nthe City seized and disposed of his Permanent Resident card, his New York State Identification \nCard, his New York State Driverโs Permit, Medicaid card, passport, and his Occupational Safety \n  5 3   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 54 of 71\nand Health Administration (โOSHAโ) card, among other belongings.  The City did not leave a \nnotice at his site explaining there had been a sweep and/or containing information about the seizure \nof his belongings. \n252.  Mr. Ventura has been unable to replace his identification cards, with the exception \nof his Permanent Resident card. \n253.  As a result, Mr. Ventura has had trouble applying for jobs and accessing certain \ngovernment services. \n254.  From in or around September or October 2023 onward, the City started to perform \nan increased number of no-notice sweeps and informed Mr. Ventura that they were no longer \nrequired to provide advance notice before conducting a sweep. \n255.  In or around the end of 2023, Mr. Ventura experienced three or four devastating \nno-notice sweeps during which the City seized and destroyed almost all of his personal belongings, \nincluding clothing and bedding that he relied on to stay warm during the colder months. \n256.  During one particular sweep, in or around October or November 2023, Mr. Ventura \nwas woken up by an inter-agency sweeps team and forced to leave his site immediately.  He only \nhad time to grab a small bag before the City started throwing his belongings into a sanitation truck.  \nHe was not permitted to take anything else with him, including bedding, clothing, heaters, a chair, \nand an electric bike.  The City permanently deprived him of these items. \n257.  The City swept Mr. Ventura on multiple occasions during inclement weather such \nas heavy rain and displaced him from his site where he had shelter from the elements, and/or \ndestroyed personal belongings that he needed to survive.  Being forced to relocate during heavy \nrain often meant that his clothing and belongings would get wet, which made it difficult to keep \nhimself warm. \n  5 4   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 55 of 71\n258.  The experience of being consistently swept by the City and losing all of his personal \nbelongings has had a hugely traumatic impact on Mr. Ventura.  It caused him to feel depressed as \nthe City would take what little he had and force him to leave when he had nowhere else to go. \n259.  In or around December 2023, Mr. Ventura obtained a placement in a shelter \nstabilization bed via his advocate at UJC-SNP and has been residing there ever since. \n260.  The City never offered Mr. Ventura a placement in a low-barrier shelter such as a \nSafe Haven or stabilization bed, and he wasnโt aware that this was an option until his advocate \nfrom UJC-SNP informed him of the existence of these beds. \n261.  While Mr. Ventura is currently residing in a stabilization bed, there is a real risk \nthat he will become street homeless in the future as he cannot reside in shelter indefinitely.  There \nhave been two separate incidents this year involving other shelter residents that caused him to feel \nvery physically unsafe.  In addition, when Mr. Ventura first entered his shelter placement, the \nshelter provider attempted to transfer another person into his room, which caused him a great deal \nof anxiety.  He was able to secure a single room due to advocacy from UJC-SNP but is cognizant \nthat he may be subject to an involuntary transfer at any time.  Mr. Ventura will return to the street \nif he has any concerns for his personal safety and/or if the shelter involuntarily transfers him to a \nshared room.  Mr. Ventura, who has been intermittently homeless over the past few decades, has \nleft a previous shelter placement due to safety concerns. \n262.  There is also a significant possibility that he will leave shelter if he does not make \nmeaningful progress in obtaining permanent housing.  In the ten months that he has been residing \nin a stabilization bed, not a single resident has moved into their own apartment and only two have \nmoved into single room supportive housing placements. \n263.  Given the transient nature of shelter, Mr. Ventura is undoubtedly at risk of being \n  5 5   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 56 of 71\nswept again in the future, being deprived of his personal belongings, and forcibly relocated. \nVI.  Damian Voorhees \n264.  Plaintiff Damian Voorhees has been street homeless in New York City for over six \nyears. \n265.  Mr. Voorhees primarily resides at two sites in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. \n266.  Mr. Voorhees has experienced somewhere in the vicinity of 50 sweeps while street \nhomeless and at least 20 sweeps in 2024 alone, including, but not limited to, on or around July 17, \nAugust 2 through August 6, August 8, August 15, September 11, September 24, October 8, October \n18, and October 24, 2024. \n267.  After being swept at least once per week in the months of June and July 2024, Mr. \nVoorhees experienced a high volume of no-notice sweeps in August 2024.  He experienced daily \nsweeps over five consecutive days during the period from on or around August 2, 2024 through \non or around August 6, 2024.  With the exception of August 5, 2024, all of these sweeps were \nโemergencyโ sweeps conducted without prior notice. \n268.  All the sweeps that Mr. Voorhees has experienced are largely conducted in the same \nway. \n269.  When the City does provide advance written notice, they typically offer one to two \ndays,โ and on occasion three days, notice prior to a sweep. \n270.  These sweeps are usually carried out by the NYPD, DOT and/or DSNY, and DHS.  \nTypically, there are two NYPD officers present, but Mr. Voorhees has experienced sweeps where \nthere have been as many as six to eight officers in attendance. \n271.  Mr. Voorhees has also experienced a night-time sweep involving only the NYPD, \nin or around early September 2023, during which officers permanently seized all of his clothing \nand a tent. \n  5 6   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 57 of 71\n272.  Mr. Voorhees stores most of his belongings in or adjacent to a wheely bin and in \none or two suitcases and/or bags.  At his primary site on a bridge, he typically has a tarpaulin that \nhe places over his belongings to indicate that they belong to someone and as protection from the \nsun and rain.  He positions his belongings in a way that does not obstruct pedestrian or car traffic. \n273.  When sweeps teams arrive at Mr. Voorheesโs site, they typically tell him to take \nwhat he can carry in one trip and go.  Sometimes, the City gives him only a few minutes to pack \nup his belongings before they begin seizing items and throwing them into a sanitation truck. \n274.  NYPD officers instruct Mr. Voorhees to move along during sweeps.  He always \ncomplies with their orders because he is afraid that he will be arrested or ticketed if he does not \ncomply. \n275.  The City has permanently deprived Mr. Voorhees of his personal belongings during \nsweeps, including but not limited to, clothing, personal identification documents, bedding, tools, \nsmall appliances such as portable camping stoves, and cash. \n276.  The City also seized and destroyed Mr. Voorheesโs social security card, birth \ncertificate, and New York State identification card during a sweep in 2023.  He has still not been \nable to replace the identification documents that the City destroyed. \n277.  Mr. Voorhees repairs scooters and bicycles for people who reside in the local area.  \nThe City has seized and destroyed scooters and bicycles, including during a sweep on or around \nAugust 15, 2024, which he received written notice of the day prior.  On another occasion, the \nNYPD refused to voucher bicycles and/or scooters in his possession and subsequently destroyed \nthem. \n278.  DHS has never vouchered or stored Mr. Voorheesโ personal belongings during a \nsweep.  NYPD officers have offered to voucher and/or store his belongings on only one other \n  5 7   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 58 of 71\noccasion, during an โemergencyโ sweep in or around early August 2024, after he requested that \nthey not dispose of his remaining belongings.  They ultimately did not voucher and/or store his \nbelongings because they would not allow him to sort through or make an inventory of the items he \nintended to store. \n279.  Mr. Voorhees has witnessed DSNY and/or DOT workers operate the compactor \nwhile conducting a sweep and crushing his personal belongings. \n280.  On July 17, 2024, the City conducted an emergency sweep without notice at his \nprimary site during which they seized and destroyed any items he was unable to carry in a single \ntrip, including power tools, clothing, plates, toiletries, and a tarpaulin. \n281.  During a no-notice sweep on or around August 2, 2024, the City seized a suitcase \ncontaining Mr. Voorheesโ clothing and disposed of it by throwing it into a sanitation truck.  There \nwere approximately eight NYPD officers present during this sweep and they told him to pack up \nand leave immediately, taking only what we could carry in one trip.  The sweeps team gave him \nmere minutes to transport his belongings and he was unable to carry the suitcase along with his \nwheely bin.  When he returned to try to claim the suitcase, he saw that the City had already placed \nit in the sanitation truck, permanently depriving him of these belongings. \n282.  On October 8, 2024, Mr. Voorhees was swept at his primary site on or around the \nbridge by an interagency team consisting of representatives from the NYPD, DOT, and DHS.  The \nCity posted a notice on October 5, 2024, however, he suspected that if he relocated to his secondary \nsite, the City would sweep him there too.  During this sweep, the City permanently deprived him \nof important personal belongings, including a foam mattress and floor mat he used for sleeping, \ntwo bicycle wheels, and a motorcycle trailer hitch that he was repairing.  An NYPD officer \nprohibited him from transporting these belongings because they described them as โineligibleโ \n  5 8   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 59 of 71\nand, in response to protests that he needed his floor mat and mattress, told him that they were \nโgoing in the garbage.โ  The City forcibly seized these items and threw them in the back of a DOT \ngarbage truck before forcing Mr. Voorhees to leave his site.  The City did not offer him storage or \na way to reclaim the belongings they took.  Rather, NYPD officers remained near his site overnight \nand have erected barricades to prevent him from returning.  A second sweeps team, involving the \nParks Department, then immediately proceeded to sweep his secondary site in the nearby park. \n283.  The  City  has  conducted  sweeps  of  Mr.  Voorhees  while  it  was  snowing  and \npermanently deprived him of warm coats. \n284.  Mr. Voorhees has also experienced sweeps while temporarily absent from his site, \nduring which the City has seized and destroyed his personal belongings despite him arranging \nthem in a way that clearly indicates they belong to someone.  The City did not leave notices at his \nsite regarding the sweep or seizure of his property. \n285.  Sometimes, as was the case on September 11, 2024, in response to a sweeps notice \ninstructing him to move his belongings and leave his site, Mr. Voorhees will pack up and relocate \nprior to the sweep to avoid having any belongings he cannot carry in a single trip being disposed \nof by the City.  This is time-consuming, as well as physically and psychologically demanding, for \nMr. Voorhees, and impedes his ability to engage in income-generating activities. \n286.  In August and September 2024, the City posted three sweeps notices and then \nultimately failed to arrive on the day of the scheduled sweeps, which meant that Mr. Voorhees was \nforced to repeatedly pack and unpack his belongings. \n287.  Repeated sweeps have negatively impacted Mr. Voorheesโ ability to sleep as he \nknows there is a risk that a sweeps team could arrive early in the morning and force him to relocate.  \nOn September 24, 2024, for example, Mr. Voorhees awoke at approximately 7:45 am to find a \n  5 9   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 60 of 71\nDOT garbage truck parked near his site and the City subsequently proceeded to sweep him. \n288.  Experiencing constant โemergencyโ or no-notice sweeps at the hands of the City \nmeans that Mr. Voorhees cannot take steps to prepare for sweeps and feels like he cannot leave his \nbelongings unattended due to the real risk that the City will arrived unannounced and dispose of \nall of his personal property. \n289.  City representatives have told him that they are going to carry out repeated sweeps \nuntil he finds somewhere else to go. \n290.  Mr. Voorheesโ has experienced psychological harm due to repeatedly being forced \nto relocate and having his personal belongings destroyed. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n291.  The individual Plaintiffs seek to represent the following classes pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:  \na.  The Property Class: Every homeless person who has had and/or will have \ntheir personal belongings seized and/or destroyed by the City of New York \nduring a โcleanupโ of a homeless hotspot, popup, or encampment. \nb.  The Forced Relocation Class: Every homeless person who has been and/or \nwill be forced to leave the place where they reside by the City of New York \ndue to the Cityโs policy and practice regarding a โcleanupโ of a homeless \nhotspot, popup, or encampment. \n292.  The  members  of  the  Property  Class  and  the  Forced  Relocation  Class  are  so \nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable.  The City of New York conducts thousands of sweeps \nper year in every City borough.  According to data reported by DSS and DSNY, between October \n2021 and June 2024, the City conducted a minimum of 11,570 sweeps.43  As of January 2024, \n \n43 This figure combines available DSS data from October 1, 2021, to August 25, 2023, with \navailable DSNY data from August 26, 2023, to June 30, 2024.  Therefore, this figure does not \ncapture the number of sweeps conducted by the City where other agencies (i.e., Parks Department, \nCDOT, SDOT and/or NYCEDC) were the designated โcleaning partnersโ from August 26, 2023 \nto June 30, 2024.  Accordingly, it should be treated as a minimum number. \n  6 0   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 61 of 71\nthere were a reported 4,140 people experiencing street homelessness in New York City.  As stated \nabove, the City does not limit sweeps to โencampments;โ sites classified as โhotspotsโ and \nโpopups,โ which are very broadly defined, are subject to sweeps.   Accordingly, the 4,140 \nindividuals, a figure widely considered to be an undercount, living unsheltered in New York City \nall reside at sites that have been and/or are likely to be swept by the City at any time. \n293.  The City has a de facto policy of unlawfully seizing and destroying the personal \nbelongings of homeless people during sweeps, and a written and de facto policy of displacing \nhomeless people and forcing them to leave their sites during sweeps.  Given the number of \nindividuals reported to be living unsheltered in New York City, the volume of sweeps carried out \neach year for the past three years, and the Cityโs widespread practice of  destroying homeless \nresidentsโ personal belongings and forcibly displacing them pursuant to its sweeps policy, there \nare clearly thousands of homeless New Yorkers affected by sweeps who fall into both the Property \nClass and Forced Relocation Class. \n294.  In addition, UJC-SNP has worked with roughly 100 clients in the past three years \nwho have experienced sweeps, had their personal belongings seized and destroyed, and been \nforcibly relocated. \n295.  The class members share a number of questions of law and fact in common. \n296.  For the Property Class, these include: \na.  Unreasonable Seizure \ni.  Whether the City has meaningfully interfered with class membersโ \npossessory interests in their personal belongings; and \nii.  Whether the Cityโs meaningful interference with class membersโ \npossessory interests in their personal belongings was unreasonable. \nb.  Unreasonable Search \ni.  Whether  the  class  members  have  a  reasonable  expectation  of \n  6 1   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 62 of 71\nprivacy in their personal belongings; and \nii.  Whether the class membersโ reasonable expectation of privacy in \ntheir personal belongings outweighs any government interest in \nconducting warrantless searches of their personal belongings. \nc.  Procedural Due Process \ni.  Whether the Cityโwhen following its written policyโprovides \nadequate notice to class members before seizing and destroying their \npersonal belongings; \nii.  Whether the City, in practice, follows its written policy of providing \nnotice to class members before seizing and destroying their personal \nbelongings; \niii.  If not, whether the Cityโs practice of providing different notice than \nin its written policyโor no notice at allโis so widespread as to \nconstitute a de facto policy; \niv.  Whether the Cityโwhen following its de facto policy of providing \nnotice (or no notice)โprovides adequate notice to class members \nbefore seizing and destroying their personal belongings; \nv.  Whether the Cityโwhen following its written policyโprovides \nadequate  post-deprivation  process  to  class  members  before \ndestroying their personal belongings; \nvi.  Whether the City, in practice, follows its written policy of providing \npost-deprivation process to class members before destroying their \npersonal belongings; \nvii.  If  not,  whether  the  Cityโs  practice  of  providing  different  post-\ndeprivation  procedures  than  in  its  written  policyโor  no  post-\ndeprivation process at allโis so widespread as to constitute a de \nfacto policy; and \nviii.  Whether  the  Cityโwhen  following  its  de  facto  policy  of  not \nproviding any post-deprivation processโprovides adequate process \nto class members before destroying their personal belongings. \nd.  Substantive Due Process โ State-Created Danger \ni.  Whether, by seizing and destroying the class membersโ personal \nbelongings,  the  City  has  engaged  in  affirmative  governmental \nconduct that has exposed and continues to expose class members to \nknown and obvious dangers that they would not otherwise face; and \n  6 2   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 63 of 71\nii.  Whether  the  Cityโs  actions  exhibited  a  repeated,  deliberate \nindifference to such obvious or known dangers for class members. \ne.  Article XVII of the New York State Constitution \ni.  Whether the class members are โneedyโ under Article XVII of the \nNew York State Constitution; \nii.  Whether the Cityโs conduct in permanently seizing and destroying \nthe class membersโ personal belongings deprive the class members \nof the aid, care and support that the State is obligated to provide; and \niii.  Whether  the  deprivation  of  the  class  membersโ  life-sustaining \nbelongings is in pursuit of any legitimate governmental objective. \n297.  For the Forced Relocation Class, these include: \na.  Substantive Due Process \ni.  Whether the City has a legitimate purpose for consistently forcing \nthe class members to relocate during sweeps; \nii.  Whether  sweeps  are  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  a  legitimate \ngovernment purpose; and \niii.  Whether  the  Cityโs  sweeps  significantly  burdened  Plaintiffsโ \nfreedom of movement. \nb.  Substantive Due Process โ State-Created Danger \ni.  Whether, by forcibly displacing the class members, the City has \nengaged in affirmative governmental conduct that has exposed and \ncontinues to expose class members to known and obvious dangers \nthat they would not otherwise face; and \nii.  Whether  the  Cityโs  actions  exhibited  a  repeated,  deliberate \nindifference to such obvious or known dangers for class members. \nc.  Bias-Based Profiling \ni.  Whether, by forcing the class members to leave their sites during \nsweeps, the City has initiated law enforcement action against them \nin reliance on their actual or perceived homelessness; or in the \nalternative \nii.  Whether, by forcing the class members to leave their sites during \nsweeps,  the  City  is  acting  pursuant  to  a  policy  that  created  a \ndisparate impact on homeless New Yorkers. \n  6 3   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 64 of 71\n298.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those of both classes.  Each class membersโ claims \narise  from  the  same  course  of  eventsโnamely,  the  Cityโs  homeless  sweeps  policy  and \nimplementationโand all  of the class members will make similar legal arguments to prove \ndefendantโs liabilityโspecifically, resolving the above common questions of law in their favor. \n299.  The  sweeps  policy  and  implementation  was  directed  at  both  the  class \nrepresentatives and the class members, and thus minor variations in the claimsโsuch as minor \nvariations in amount of notice, amount of items destroyed, etc.โdo not defeat typicality. \n300.  The legal theories under which Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief are \nthe same or similar to those on which all members of the class will rely, and the harms suffered by \nPlaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n301.  The class representatives will adequately protect the interests of the class. The class \nrepresentativesโ interests are not antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class.  Indeed, \nthey are perfectly aligned.  And there is no conflict between the class representatives and the class \nthey wish to seek, let alone a โfundamentalโ one. \n302.  Plaintiffs are represented by Marika Dias and Natalie Druce of the Urban Justice \nCenter โ Safety Net Project (โUJC-SNPโ); Siya Hegde of the National Homelessness Law Center \n(โNHLCโ); and Luna Droubi and Keegan Stephan of the law firm Beldock Levine & Hoffman \nLLP (โBLHโ). \n303.  UJC-SNP has provided direct legal services to thousands of low-income New \nYorkers and has extensive experience working with homeless individuals. UJC-SNP has also \nlitigated various group cases involving tenants and/or homelessness rights, including 117 West 141 \nLLC v. Michelle Pager, et. al., No. LT-308389-21 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2021), In the Matter of \nthe Application of Barry Simon v. Patrick J. Foye, 2021 WL 2480059 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. \n  6 4   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 65 of 71\n2021), and Albelo v. City of New York, 2023 WL 4464109, N.Y. Slip Op. 32324(U) (N.Y. Sup. Ct. \nN.Y. Cty. 2023). \n304.  Founded in 1989 as the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, NHLC \nis a leading law and policy nonprofit charged with the mission to prevent and end homelessness in \nAmerica. NHLC has established institutional expertise around the criminalization of homelessness \nacross litigation and policy advocacy spaces, as well as its written publications (including Housing \nNot Handcuffs 2019: Ending the Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities, which analyzes \n187 city laws that effectively criminalize persons experiencing homelessness when they engage in \ncritical, life-sustaining public activities). Recent cases in which the Law Center served as counsel \nof record include several class actions, including, but not limited to, Martin v. Boise, 920 F.3d 584 \n(9th Cir. 2019) (challenging the constitutional validity of ordinances that ban public sleeping and \ncamping on behalf of persons experiencing unsheltered homelessness), Singleton v. Taylor, 2023 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 40560 (M.D. Ala., Aug. 25, 2021) (holding Alabama state laws that criminalized \npanhandling in public places unconstitutional under the First Amendment), and Bloom v. City of \nSan Diego, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47587 (S.D. Cal., Mar. 15, 2024) (challenging the ticketing the \nhomeless people, many being people with disabilities, who were living in RVs and other vehicular \nencampments). \n305.  BLH attorneys have litigated a number of class action lawsuits including, but not \nlimited to Syed v. City of New York, 16-CV-04789 (S.D.N.Y.); Elsayed v. City of New York et al., \n18-CV-10566 (S.D.N.Y.); Floyd v. City of New York, 08-CV-1034 (S.D.N.Y.); Daniels v. City of \nNew  York,  198  F.R.D.  409  (S.D.N.Y.  2001)  (โclass  counsel  is  undoubtedly  qualified  and \nexperienced to conduct this litigation.โ); and MacNamara v. City of New York, 275 F.R.D. 125 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2011). \n  6 5   \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-08221-JGK     Document 1     Filed 10/29/24     Page 66 of 71\n306.  Plaintiffsโ counsel has the resources, expertise, and experience to prosecute this \naction, and know of no conflicts among members of the class or between the attorneys and \nmembers of the class. \n307.  The Plaintiff class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure because Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, \nthereby making class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief appropriate. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCount One \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, United States Constitution, Amendment IV \nUnreasonable Seizure \nAgainst the Individual Defendants (John and Jane Does 1-20) \n308.
