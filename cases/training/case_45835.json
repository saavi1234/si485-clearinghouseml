Plaintiffs brought suit under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12101, and &sect;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794, to seek injunctive relief requiring defendants to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services and prevent themselves or similarly-situated minors from institutionalization in hospitals and congregate care settings. Their complaint alleged that defendants&rsquo; failure to provide such services resulted in the institutionalization of minors in restrictive environments such as psychiatric hospitals and congregate care settings. The case was assigned to District Judge Melissa R. DuBose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of February 2025, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Over the past decade, mental and behavioral health challenges among Rhode Island children \nand youth have steadily worsened. In 2022, 28.7% of Rhode Island children ages 3-17 were \nstruggling with a mental, emotional, or behavioral health issue. The rate of Rhode Island high \nschool students who report feeling sad or hopeless for more than two weeks per year has \nsurged by 30% over the past decade. Suicidality has also steadily risen. In 2023, 9% of \nRhode Island high school students reported attempting suicide at least once in the previous \nyear. In 2024, an alarming 17% of high schoolers and 23% of middle schoolers seriously \nconsidered suicide, with these rates disproportionately higher among girls. \n2.  In May 2022, Rhode Island mental health professionals sounded the alarm, declaring a โstate \nof emergencyโ in child and adolescent mental health. Their declaration highlighted the \nโskyrocketing rates of depression, anxiety, trauma, and suicidality that will have lasting \nimpacts on them, their families, and their communities.โ They underscored the โdramatic \nincreasesโ in emergency department visits for mental health emergencies, and urged a \nconcentrated effort to โinvest in community-based, responsive outpatient care to identify and \ntreat youth earlier in their mental health journeys.โ Early intervention, they emphasized, \nwould alleviate pressure on families and reduce reliance on higher levels of care by \npreventing โfull-blown mental health crises.โ \n3.   Over 20,000 Rhode Island children and youth with behavioral health disabilities rely on \nMedicaid for critical behavioral health services. But despite the urgency and gravity of the \ncrisis, the response has been woefully and consistently inadequate. As a result, hundreds of \nvulnerable young people continue to be denied timely access to the behavioral health services \nthey desperately need and are entitled to under federal law.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 4 of 68 PageID #: 4\n \n \n4.  This action follows years of glaring failures in Rhode Islandโs behavioral health system for \nchildren and youth. It seeks to remedy Rhode Islandโs long-standing and well-documented \nfailure to provide or arrange for treatment for Medicaid-eligible children and youth with \nsignificant behavioral health needs.  \n5.  Plaintiffs are Medicaid-eligible children and youth with a serious emotional disturbance \n(โSEDโ), including SED and co-occurring developmental disabilities (โDDโ), who are being \ndenied medically necessary Intensive Home and Community-Based Services required under \nthe Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (โEPSDTโ) provisions of the \nMedicaid Act. Without access to these crucial services, Plaintiffs are institutionalized in \nacute-care psychiatric hospitals or through prolonged placement in segregated congregate \ncare settings such as group homes, psychiatric residential treatment facilities, and other \nresidential treatment centers. The harmful effects of such restrictive environments on \nchildren and youth are widely recognized and well-documented. \n6.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated children against \nDefendants Richard Charest, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Rhode Island \nExecutive Office of Health and Human Services (โEOHHSโ), and Ashley Deckert, in her \nofficial capacity as Director of the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families \n(โDCYFโ). \n7.  Federal law requires Defendants to arrange for and provide necessary behavioral health \nservices to Plaintiffs in a timely manner. Specifically, under the EPSDT provisions of the \nMedicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 1396d(a)(4)(B), Defendants are required to \nprovide or arrange for intensive home and community-based behavioral health services \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 5 of 68 PageID #: 5\n \n \n(hereinafter โIntensive Home and Community-Based Servicesโ) for Medicaid-eligible \nchildren and youth who need them, including: \nโข  Intensive Care Coordination: Case management and planning services facilitated \nby a child and family team, designed to coordinate and manage care across \nmultiple systems. \nโข  Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services: Individualized therapeutic interventions \ndelivered in homes and other community settings on a frequent and consistent \nbasis, aimed at improving behavior and preventing out-of-home placements. \nโข  Mobile Crisis Services: 24/7 emergency services that respond to a childโs acute \nmental health needs quickly, preventing unnecessary out-of-home placements or \nhospitalizations. \n8.  Defendants are further required to ensure these Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices are available to Medicaid-eligible children and youth โwith reasonable promptness.โ \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8). \n9.  By participating in the Medicaid program and accepting federal funding, Defendants chose to \nbe bound by federal laws, including the Medicaid Actโs EPSDT and โreasonable \npromptnessโ provisions. However, Defendants consistently fail to meet these requirements, \ndenying Named Plaintiffs and members of the class timely access to critical Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services, in violation of federal law. Defendantsโ ongoing failures \nonly worsen the behavioral health crisis affecting Rhode Island children and youth. \n10. Defendantsโ failure to provide Named Plaintiffs and members of the class with timely access \nto Intensive Home and Community-Based Services also violates the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (the โADAโ) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Federal law requires \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 6 of 68 PageID #: 6\n \n \nDefendants to provide Named Plaintiffs and members of the class treatment in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs and prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability. Deprived of the medically necessary Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices at issue here, Named Plaintiffs and members of the class have been and will be \nunnecessarily hospitalized and institutionalized, and subjected to prolonged stays in hospitals \nand congregate care settings that could have been avoided.  \n11. Defendantsโ failure to build an adequate behavioral health system for children and youth \nviolates the EPSDT and โreasonable promptnessโ provisions of the Medicaid Act, as well as \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Defendantsโ ongoing failures harm Rhode Islandโs children \nand youth every day. Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief requiring Defendants to \nprovide the medically necessary Intensive Home and Community-Based Services to which \nNamed Plaintiffs and members of the class are entitled under federal law, and to end and \nprevent their unnecessary institutionalization in hospitals and congregate care settings. \nJURISDCTION AND VENUE \n12. This action is brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 because Defendants, and each of them, acting \nunder the color of state law, have deprived the Named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent of rights secured by federal law. \n13. This Action arises under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396 et seq., Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 12101 et seq., and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over the subject \nmatter of this action under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. ยง \n1343 (civil rights jurisdiction). Plaintiffsโ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 7 of 68 PageID #: 7\n \n \nauthorized under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \n14. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Defendants are sued in \ntheir official capacity and perform their official duties by and through offices within the \ndistrict and thus reside therein; a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to \nthe claims herein occurred within this district; and at least one of the Plaintiffs resides in this \ndistrict. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n15. The Named Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16. The Class is defined as all current and future Medicaid-eligible children in Rhode Island \nunder the age of 21 (a) who have been diagnosed by a licensed practitioner of the healing arts \nwith SED, including SED with co-occurring DD, and (b) for whom Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services have been recommended by a licensed practitioner in order to \ncorrect or ameliorate their conditions. \n17. The Class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. Medicaid covers \napproximately 180,000 children and youth in Rhode Island, including all 2,500 children \ninvolved in the DCYF-administered foster care system. In FY 2024, more than 20,000 Rhode \nIsland children enrolled in Medicaid had a behavioral health disability; 16% of those children \nhave co-occurring developmental disabilities. Further, the fluid nature of the Class, the \ngeographic diversity of Class members, the limited financial resources of Class members, as \nwell as the unknown identity of future Class members, make joinder impracticable.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 8 of 68 PageID #: 8\n \n \n18. The deficiencies in Rhode Islandโs behavioral health system for children and youth as \ndetailed more fully below, and the resulting harms to the children in the Class, arise from \nDefendantsโ statewide policies and practices, including the following: \na. Defendantsโ failure to maintain a sufficient array of Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services, including Intensive Care Coordination, Intensive In-\nHome Services, and Mobile Crisis Services, to meet the needs of children in the \nClass. For example: \ni.  EOHHS has admitted that only 57% of children ages 6-17 received \ncritical follow-up care after hospitalization for mental illness. \nii.  In 2023, 62.1% of Rhode Island youth who experienced a major \ndepressive episode received no mental health services at all. \nWorse, only 13.9% received consistent treatment, far below the \nnational average.  \niii.  While the Medicaid Act requires Defendants to cover medically \nnecessary services for children, regardless of whether they are \nincluded in the State Plan or Medicaid Waiver programs, children \nin Rhode Island only have access to a limited group of services. \nTreating professionals refer children to the services that exist, even \nwhen other services are medically necessary for those children. As \na result, Defendants do not provide the medically necessary \nIntensive Home and Community-Based Services to the children \nwho need them. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 9 of 68 PageID #: 9\n \n \niv.  Defendants also fail to arrange for or provide services for children \nat the required intensity, frequency, or duration. As a result, the \nservices Defendants arrange for or provide are not Intensive In-\nHome Services as required by law.  \nv.  The EOHHS certification standards for one service on which \nDefendants rely heavily for children with SED and/or co-occurring \nSED and DD explicitly state the service is โnot intended to \nreplaceโฆ behavioral health treatment.โ \nvi.  Another commonly used service in Rhode Islandโs behavioral \nhealth system is not a mental health service at all; it is designed to \nprovide personal assistance with activities of daily living. Though \nits goal of improving social skills and maintaining safety may be \nrelated to behavioral health needs, EOHHSโs certification \nstandards explicitly state the service is โnot for individuals \nexhibiting marked impairments involving: self-control (e.g., \naggression or conduct); severe disturbances in thinking, \nperception, or mood; or learning disabilities.โ (emphasis in \noriginal). This service necessarily excludes children for whom \nIntensive Home and Community-Based Services are medically \nnecessary. \nb. Defendantsโ failure to implement or ensure adequate policies and practices to \nreasonably ensure a sufficient array of Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices providers, including providers of Intensive Care Coordination, Intensive \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 10 of 68 PageID #:\n10\n \n \nIn-Home Services, and Mobile Crisis Services, to meet the needs of the children \nin the Class. For example: \ni.  Emergency department visits for children with behavioral health \ndiagnoses have risen for more than a decade, increasing by more \nthan 60%, reflecting an overwhelmed behavioral health system ill-\nequipped to meet childrenโs needs. \nii.  On June 19, 2024, a snapshot of DCYF-contracted provider \ncapacity showed that one provider of mental health services was at \nfull caseload capacity, and two others had exceeded their full \ncapacity (126% and 132%). \nc. Defendantsโ failure to implement adequate policies and practices to reasonably \nensure that children in the Class are able to obtain the Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services to which they are entitled, with reasonable \npromptness, including to ensure that children with co-occurring DD are not \nexcluded from such services. For example: \ni.  EOHHS fails to maintain data regarding the number of children \nwaiting for or delayed in receiving behavioral health services. \nii.  A March 6, 2023 snapshot of DCYFโs data regarding referrals for \nDCYF-contracted home-based services showed that 284 youth \nwere on waitlists for services. As of that date, children had been \nwaiting 555 days or more for services. One child had been on the \nwaitlist for more than four years (1485 days). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 11 of 68 PageID #:\n11\n \n \niii.  According to a report issued by the Rhode Island Coalition for \nChildren and Families (โRICCFโ)โan organization made up of 42 \nlocal stakeholders including 39 providersโon October 17, 2024, \n733 children were on waitlists for behavioral health services \nbetween January and June 2023, with wait times ranging from one \nweek to one year. RICCF noted that even this figure is likely an \nundercount, as not all programs track waitlists. \niv.  The June 19, 2024 snapshot of DCYF-contracted provider capacity \nshows that while hundreds of children are on waitlists, some \nproviders are operating well below capacity. Two providers offer a \nspecific type of outpatient service; they were operating at 25% and \n41% of capacity. Although three of the contracted providers of \nmental health services were operating at or above capacity, the ten \nmental health providers were at a combined capacity of 82%. By \nJuly 31, 2024, that had dropped to 77%. \nv.  Many DCYF-contracted providers and services specifically \nexclude youth with co-occurring intellectual and/or developmental \ndisabilities from their services. For example, the only two DCYF-\ncontracted providers of Multi-Systemic Therapy exclude youth \nwith Autism Spectrum Disorder or other DD from their services. \nThe sole Teen Assertive Community Treatment provider similarly \nexcludes this population. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 12 of 68 PageID #:\n12\n \n \nd. Defendantsโ failure to implement adequate policies and practices to reasonably \nensure that the children in the Class are able to obtain medically necessary \nbehavioral health services in the least restrictive environment and most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs and are not unnecessarily institutionalized or \nsegregated because Intensive Home and Community-Based Services are \nunavailable. For example: \ni.  EOHHS fails to maintain data regarding the number of children \nreceiving services in a more restrictive setting than is appropriate \nto their needs. \nii.  A June 13, 2022 snapshot of DCYFโs data regarding referrals to \ncongregate care settings showed that 115 youth were on waitlists \nfor such placements. Thirty-four of those children were in the \nhospital awaiting a lower level of care; each had been on the \nwaitlist for 335 days or more. \niii.  Between November 1, 2022 and June 16, 2023, two Rhode Island \nhospitals discharged 155 children to lower levels of behavioral \nhealth care. Of those, 116 were placed in acute residential \ntreatment facilities or other congregate care. \n19. As a result of the policies and practices referenced above and set out more fully below, \nchildren in the Class are subject to serious harm including the following: (a) they are being \ndenied the Intensive Home and Community-Based Services to which they are entitled under \nthe Medicaid Act; (b) they are unable to obtain behavioral health services in the least \nrestrictive environment and the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs; (c) they are \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 13 of 68 PageID #:\n13\n \n \nunnecessarily institutionalized and denied community integration; and (d) they are exposed \nto imminent future violations of the Medicaid Act, the ADA, and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.    \n20. There are questions of fact and law common to the claims of all Class members, including \nthe following: \na. Whether Defendants fail to provide or ensure that medically necessary Intensive \nHome and Community-Based Services are available, and whether the resulting \ninability of Class members to obtain such services, or to obtain such services with \nreasonable promptness, violates the Medicaid Act.  \nb. Whether Defendants fail to implement adequate policies and practices to \nreasonably monitor and ensure that Class members are able to obtain Intensive \nHome and Community-Based Services, and whether the resulting inability of \nClass members to obtain those services or to obtain them with reasonable \npromptness, violates the Medicaid Act. \nc. Whether Defendants fail to ensure that sufficient qualified providers of Intensive \nHome and Community-Based Services are available to meet the needs of the \nClass, and whether the resulting inability of Class members to obtain those \nservices or to obtain them with reasonable promptness, violates the Medicaid Act. \nd. Whether Defendants fail to make available Intensive Home and Community-\nBased Services to members of the Class in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, and whether the resulting segregation or unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of members of the Class, or the resulting risk of such \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 14 of 68 PageID #:\n14\n \n \nsegregation or unnecessary institutionalization, violates the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \ne. Whether Defendants fail to implement adequate coordination, policies and \npractices, and to reasonably monitor and ensure that Class members are able to \nobtain Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to their needs, and whether these failures violate the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act. \nf.  Whether Defendants fail to ensure a sufficient network of Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services providers and to implement adequate policies and \npractices to reasonably ensure a sufficient array of these services, such that \nmembers of the Class are able to obtain mental and behavioral health services in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and are not segregated or \ninstitutionalized, and whether these failures violate the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  \ng. Whether Defendantsโ policies, practices, and procedures in the administration of \ntheir mental and behavioral health system violate the Named Plaintiffsโ and Class \nmembersโ rights under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \nh. Whether the Named Plaintiffs and Class members are entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to vindicate their statutory rights.  \n21. Named Plaintiffs are each members of the Class. The claims that the Named Plaintiffs raise, \nand the resulting harms and risks of serious harm, are typical of those of the Class. Class \nmembersโ claims arise from the same course of events and circumstances, and each Class \nmember would make similar legal arguments to prove Defendantsโ liability. The remedies \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 15 of 68 PageID #:\n15\n \n \nsought by the Named Plaintiffs are the same remedies that would benefit the Class: a \ndeclaration that their statutory rights have been violated and an injunction requiring \nDefendants to take affirmative action to cure the ongoing violations of law and to provide or \narrange for sufficient Intensive Home and Community-Based Services to correct or \nameliorate the behavioral health conditions of the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass. \n22. The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the Class. There are \nno conflicts among the Named Plaintiffs and any members of the Class. The Next Friends are \ndedicated to representing the Named Plaintiffsโ best interests. \n23. The undersigned counsel have extensive experience in litigating civil rights and class action \nlawsuits, including those involving the rights of children, and the rights of individuals with \nmental and behavioral health diagnoses and developmental disabilities. \n24. Because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that are generally applicable to \nthe Class, injunctive and declaratory relief are appropriate respecting the Class as a whole. \nPARTIES \nI.  PLAINTIFFS \n25. The Plaintiffs are Medicaid-eligible children in Rhode Island under the age of 21 who have \nbeen diagnosed with a serious emotional disturbance (โSEDโ), including with co-occurring \nSED and developmental disability (โDDโ). Each childโs treating professional(s) \nrecommended Intensive Home and Community-Based Services to treat their conditions. \nHowever, due to the well-known and pervasive deficiencies in Rhode Islandโs mental health \nsystem for children and youth, none of the Plaintiffs received those services with reasonable \npromptness and/or in the intensity, frequency, and duration they need, as required by federal \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 16 of 68 PageID #:\n16\n \n \nlaw. Further, each Plaintiff is either currently, or was previously, unnecessarily segregated \nfrom their families and communities in a hospital or congregate care setting in violation of \ntheir rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \n26. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (โHHSโ) defines โchildren with a \nserious emotional disturbanceโ as 1) any persons from birth to age 21,1 2) who currently or at \nany time within the last year, 3) have or were diagnosed as having an emotional, behavioral, \nor mental disorder specified within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (โDSM-IVโ) which \nsubstantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. 58 Fed. Reg. 29425 \n(May 20, 1993).2  \n27. HHS defines a developmental disability as 1) a severe and chronic disability attributable to a \nmental and/or physical impairment, 2) that manifests before age 22 and is likely to continue \nindefinitely, and 3) results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the \nfollowing major life activities: self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, \nmobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. 45 \nC.F.R. ยง 1325.3.3 \n \n \n \n1 The HHS definition of children with SED includes those up to age 18, or older at the option of the state. Rhode \nIslandโs Medicaid State Plan extends Medicaid eligibility to youth until age 21. \n2 Rhode Island defines children with SED to only include those whose disability lasts more than a year or has the \npotential to do so; the child needs โmulti-agency intervention;โ and the child is either in an out-of-home placement \nor at risk of same. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-72-5(b)(24). However, Medicaidโs Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, \nand Treatment (โEPSDTโ) benefit requires the provision of medically necessary services to all Medicaid-eligible \nchildren, and the U.S. DHHS has not approved any plan or waiver using the Stateโs definition of SED. Therefore, \nthis Complaint uses the federal definition of children with a SED. \n3 Rhode Island similarly uses a more restrictive definition of a child with a DD. Such children are only those under \nage 18, or under 21 if they began receiving DCYF services before age 18 and have continuously received them \nthereafter. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-72-5(b)(24). For the reasons discussed in fn. 2, this Complaint uses the federal \ndefinition of DD. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 17 of 68 PageID #:\n17\n \n \nA.  Plaintiff J.โE.โL. \n28. Plaintiff J.โE.โL. identifies as gender fluid and uses โthey/themโ pronouns. They go by \n(and are hereinafter referred to as) E.L. They are a 17-year-old Medicaid recipient from \nJohnston, Rhode Island. They bring this action through their next friend, Patricia Byrnes, \nwho resides in Barrington, Rhode Island. Ms. Byrnes has worked as an attorney for 40 \nyears, with much of her work focusing on special education and child welfare. She is \nfamiliar with the harms and substantial risks of serious harm that E.L. has suffered \nthrough the lack of appropriate Medicaid-funded services administered by DCYF and \nEOHHS. Ms. Byrnes is fully committed to representing E.L. as their next friend. \n29. E.L. has a sharp wit. They are artistic and especially enjoy sketching their own creations. \nThey like listening to a wide variety of music.  \n30. E.L. is diagnosed with SED, specifically Major Depressive Disorder and Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder.  \n31. Qualified professionals have determined that E.L.โs mental health conditions \nsubstantially limit their ability to engage in major life activities, including their \nfunctioning in family, school, and community activities. \n32. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and/or in the intensity, frequency, and duration they need and to which \nthey are legally entitled, has negatively affected E.L.โs mental health. Although E.L.โs \nfather repeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep \nE.L. safely at home, they were repeatedly institutionalized and segregated in hospitals, \nresidential treatment facilities, and partial hospitalization programs. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 18 of 68 PageID #:\n18\n \n \n33. E.L. is DCYF-involved through its Division of Family Services. E.L. does not receive \nIntensive Care Coordination from or through DCYF. \n34. In January 2021, DCYF referred E.L. to the acute residential treatment program at St. \nMaryโs Home for Children (โSt. Maryโsโ) due to safety concerns at home. E.L. later \nmoved to the psychiatric residential treatment facility within St. Maryโs. \n35. In March 2023, E.L.โs treating psychiatrist documented that they no longer required acute \nresidential care and were ready for discharge. However, St. Maryโs did not discharge E.L. \nat that time due to the lack of necessary and available Intensive Home and Community-\nBased Services in a less restrictive setting. \n36. In April 2023, E.L.โs treating psychiatrist documented that E.L. had regressed due to \nremaining in a psychiatric residential treatment facility (St. Maryโs) and recertified their \nneed for acute residential care.  \n37. In October 2023, E.L.โs treating psychiatrist again documented that E.L. no longer met \nthe criteria for that level of care, and they were ready for discharge. Again, St. Maryโs did \nnot discharge E.L. due to the unavailability of Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices. \n38. In January 2024, E.L. was accepted to a semi-independent living program designed to \nsupport their transition to community living and adulthood. However, E.L. was put on a \nwaitlist for the program, and remained at St. Maryโs. \n39. In February 2024, E.L. was hospitalized due to self-injurious behavior. Their treating \nprofessional expressly linked the behavior to remaining at St. Maryโs and not being \ndischarged to appropriate community-based treatment. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 19 of 68 PageID #:\n19\n \n \n40. E.L. remained at St. Maryโs until June 2024, when DCYF removed all youth due to \nallegations of systemic abuse and neglect. E.L. was discharged to the semi-independent \nliving program for which they had been wait-listed.  \n41. While E.L. sees a clinician through the residential program, they do not receive the \nIntensive Home and Community-Based Services they need. E.L. continues to attend a \nsegregated school that only serves youth with mental and behavioral health needs. They \nhave been readmitted to the hospital once since transitioning to the residential program. \n42. Defendants have failed to ensure E.L.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which they are entitled, E.L. has \nbeen and will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n43. E.L. desires intensive behavioral health services in their home and other community-\nbased settings. \nB.  Plaintiff A.โT.โC. \n44. Plaintiff A.โT.โC. identifies as transgender and uses โhe/himโ pronouns. He goes by (and \nis hereinafter referred to as) T.C. He is a 17-year-old Medicaid recipient from Tiverton, \nRhode Island. He brings this action through his grandparents and next friends, D.T and \nP.T. \n45. T.C. is a persistent self-advocate who is eager to help other youth have a better \nexperience than his own. He is interested in creating and listening to music.  \n46. T.C. is diagnosed with SED, specifically Major Depressive Disorder, Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. \nHe also has a seizure disorder. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 20 of 68 PageID #:\n20\n \n \n47. Qualified professionals have determined that T.C.โs mental health conditions \nsubstantially limit his ability to engage in major life activities, including his functioning \nin family, school, and community activities. \n48. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration he needs and to which he is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected T.C.โs mental health. Although D.T. and P.T. \nrepeatedly sought these services in order to keep him safely at home, he was repeatedly \ninstitutionalized and segregated in hospitals and residential treatment facilities. \n49. T.C. is DCYF-involved through its Division of Community Services and Behavioral \nHealth. Upon information and belief, he does not receive Intensive Care Coordination \nfrom or through DCYF. \n50. In April 2023, DCYF referred T.C. to the psychiatric residential treatment facility at St. \nMaryโs as a step-down placement from hospitalization. T.C. remained at St. Maryโs until \nJune 2024, when DCYF removed all youth due to allegations of systemic abuse and \nneglect.  \n51. DCYF planned to return T.C. to his grandparentsโ home upon discharge and assured D.T. \nand P.T. that home-based services would be in place prior to discharge. However, there \nwas a months-long waitlist for the service his treating professionals recommended.  \n52. Although home-based services were medically necessary and the appropriate level of \ncare for T.C., DCYF failed to address the waitlist issue or explore other home-based \noptions. Instead, DCYF considered placing T.C. in another congregate care facility. The \nsetting could not meet his needs due to his seizures. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 21 of 68 PageID #:\n21\n \n \n53. As a result, the Family Court required T.C. to remain at the psychiatric residential \ntreatment facility for another two weeks. He was the only youth residing at St. Maryโs \nduring that time, and did not receive any clinical services.  \n54. T.C. finally left St. Maryโs in late June 2024 and returned to his grandparentsโ house \nwithout any therapeutic services in place.  \n55. T.C. now receives home and community-based services, though not with the intensity, \nfrequency, or duration needed. He continues to attend a segregated school that only \nserves youth with behavioral health needs.  \n56. He has been seen at a hospital emergency department since being discharged home. T.C. \nhad a crisis and D.T. attempted to access Mobile Crisis Services, as she had been \ninstructed. Twice, she left a message for the service. It took another two hours for \nsomeone to return her calls. By that time, T.C. had gone to the hospital.  \n57. Defendants have failed to ensure T.C.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which he is entitled, T.C. has been \nand will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n58. T.C. desires intensive behavioral health services in his home and other community-based \nsettings. \nC.  Plaintiff L.A. \n59. Plaintiff L.A. is a 14-year-old Medicaid-eligible youth from West Warwick, Rhode \nIsland. She is the sister of J.L.A., J.S.A., and K.A. L.A. brings this action through her \nmother and next friend, R.X. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 22 of 68 PageID #:\n22\n \n \n60. L.A.โs family describes her as smart, creative, empathetic, and artistic. She likes to help \nothers and enjoys visiting the mall and zoo. \n61. L.A. is diagnosed with SED, including Reactive Attachment Disorder, Disruptive Mood \nDysregulation Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.  \n62. Qualified professionals have determined that L.A.โs mental conditions substantially limit \nher ability to engage in major life activities, including her functioning in family, school, \nand community activities. \n63. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration she needs and to which she is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected L.A.โs mental health. Although her mother \nrepeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep L.A. \nsafely at home, she was repeatedly institutionalized in hospitals and residential \nplacements.  \n64. L.A. is not DCYF-involved. She does not receive Intensive Care Coordination from or \nthrough DCYF. \n65. L.A. was hospitalized eight separate times in 2018 alone; one on occasion, she was \nreadmitted to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged. Between February 2018 \nand July 2024, L.A. was hospitalized 12 separate times, the longest lasting 201 \nconsecutive days. Overall, she was hospitalized for 542 days. She also spent 322 \nconsecutive days in residential placement. That is 864 days, or 2.4 years, in out-of-home \nplacements. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 23 of 68 PageID #:\n23\n \n \n66. During one hospitalization in 2018, L.A.โs treatment team recommended a type of service \nso she could be discharged home. However, DCYF failed to refer L.A. for the services \nand, as a result, L.A. transitioned to a partial hospitalization program โ a more restrictive \nlevel of treatment than originally recommended. \n67. L.A. has received services through a provider agency since 2021. Her most recent \nprogress report indicates L.A. โhas not made much progress due [in part to] services \nprovided just once a week,โ though EOHHS requires each provider of this particular \nservice to certify that it will provide a minimum of 10 hours per week of such services to \neach child. \n68. During a recent hospitalization, L.A.โs treating professional recommended increased \nservices to support her at home. Instead, she was offered center-based Applied \nBehavioral Analysis, a service that is inappropriate for L.A. as she is not diagnosed with \nAutism Spectrum Disorder. \n69. Prior to her discharge from the most recent hospitalization on July 24, 2024, L.A.โs \ntreating professionals referred her for assistance with daily living activities. As of this \nfiling, L.A. does not receive the services at the necessary level of intensity. \n70. Defendants have failed to ensure L.A.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which she is entitled, L.A. has been \nand will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n71. L.A. desires intensive behavioral health services in her home and other community-based \nsettings. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 24 of 68 PageID #:\n24\n \n \nD.  Plaintiff E.M. \n72. Plaintiff E.M. is a 15-year-old Medicaid recipient from Warwick, Rhode Island. She \nbrings this action through her mother and next friend, C.M. \n73. E.M. loves anime. She has a quick sense of humor and wants to be an actress when she \ngrows up. \n74. E.M. is diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, an SED. \n75. Qualified professionals have determined that E.M.โs mental condition substantially limits \nher ability to engage in major life activities, including her functioning in family, school, \nand community activities. \n76. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration she needs and to which she is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected E.M.โs mental health. Although her mother, \nC.M., repeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep \nE.M. safely at home, she was repeatedly institutionalized and segregated in hospitals and \nresidential treatment facilities. \n77. E.M. is involved with DCYF through its Division of Community Services and Behavioral \nHealth. She does not receive Intensive Care Coordination from or through DCYF. \n78. In April 2023, DCYF determined that E.M.โs foster placement was no longer viable due \nto E.M.โs trauma-related behaviors, which included restlessly wandering the home all \nnight and self-injury. DCYF failed to ensure access to necessary Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services for E.M., instead referring her to the psychiatric residential \ntreatment facility at St. Maryโs. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 25 of 68 PageID #:\n25\n \n \n79. In March 2024, E.M. was wait-listed for a less restrictive setting, and remained at St. \nMaryโs until May 2024. She was discharged to a congregate care facility.  \n80. E.M.โs care at the facility is overseen by a clinician; she also has a community mentor. \n81. Defendants have failed to ensure E.M.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which she is entitled, E.M. has been \nand will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n82. E.M. desires intensive behavioral health services in her home and other community-based \nsettings. \nE.  Plaintiff D.R.V. \n83. Plaintiff D.R.V. is a 17-year-old Medicaid recipient from Woonsocket, Rhode Island. She \nbrings this action through her mother and next friend, A.R.V. \n84. D.R.V. is a kind young lady with a beautiful smile. She loves animals and nature and \nplans to go into the marketing field.  \n85. D.R.V. is diagnosed with SED, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major \nDepressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder with Depressed \nMood. She also has medical conditions and seizures. \n86. Qualified professionals have determined that D.R.V.โs mental health disabilities and \nmedical conditions substantially limit her ability to engage in major life activities, \nincluding her functioning in family, school, and community activities. \n87. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration she needs and to which she is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected D.R.V.โs mental health. Although her mother, \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 26 of 68 PageID #:\n26\n \n \nA.R.V., repeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep \nD.R.V. safely at home, she was repeatedly institutionalized and segregated in hospitals \nand residential treatment facilities. \n88. D.R.V. is involved with DCYF through its Division of Family Services. Upon \ninformation and belief, she does not receive Intensive Care Coordination from or through \nDCYF. \n89. In July 2023, DCYF referred D.R.V. to an acute residential treatment program at St. \nMaryโs. DCYF reportedly made the referral because D.R.V.โs family was unable to meet \nher medical and behavioral health needs. D.R.V. later moved to the psychiatric residential \ntreatment unit at St. Maryโs.  \n90. DCYF began referring D.R.V. to placements offering a lower level of care in January \n2024. In March 2024, D.R.V.โs treating psychiatrist documented that D.R.V. was still \nโawaiting placement at [lower level of care].โ  \n91. In May 2024, due to the unavailability of medically necessary services, D.R.V.โs treating \npsychiatrist documented a new discharge plan, proposing D.R.V. would move in with a \nfamily member at an unspecified future date. \n92. D.R.V. was discharged from St. Maryโs in June 2024, when DCYF removed all of the \nyouth due to allegations of systemic abuse and neglect. DCYF placed her in a non-family \nfoster home. At that time, DCYF did not have any behavioral health services in place for \nD.R.V. \n93. After her transition to the foster home, D.R.V. reported that her DCYF social worker \ntransported her to physical therapy appointments but had been too busy to ensure D.R.V. \ngot to them all. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 27 of 68 PageID #:\n27\n \n \n94. As of this filing, D.R.V. is finally receiving limited therapy services. She also has a \ncommunity mentor. \n95. Defendants have failed to ensure D.R.V.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which she is entitled, D.R.V. has \nbeen and will be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n96. D.R.V. desires intensive behavioral health services in her home and other community-\nbased settings. \nF.  Plaintiff J.C. \n97. Plaintiff J.C. is a 6-year-old Medicaid recipient from East Providence, Rhode Island. He \nbrings this action through his mother and next friend, C.C. \n98. J.C. is caring, energetic, and helpful. His mother describes him as โbrimming with \ncuriosity.โ He loves being outdoors, exploring new things, and observing insects. He also \nenjoys riding his bike and playing with friends. \n99. J.C. is diagnosed with co-occurring SED and DD: Autism Spectrum Disorder by history, \nan unspecified mood disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Attention-\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. \n100. Qualified professionals have determined that J.C.โs mental and developmental conditions \nsubstantially limit his ability to engage in major life activities, including his functioning \nin family, school, and community activities. \n101. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration he needs and to which he is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected J.C.โs mental health. Although J.C.โs mother \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 28 of 68 PageID #:\n28\n \n \nrepeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep J.C. \nsafely at home, he has been institutionalized and segregated in a hospital.  \n102. J.C. was previously involved with DCYF through its Division of Family Services but is \nno longer DCYF-involved. When C.C. attempted to access services through DCYF, she \nwas told to contact her husbandโs private insurance company, and did not receive any \nassistance or assessment from DCYF. \n103. On June 28, 2023, J.C. was admitted to a partial hospitalization program. In preparation \nfor discharge, his treating professional referred J.C. for a particular model of services, but \nthe waitlist was approximately eight weeks long. \n104. Instead, an agency provided J.C. with a different service after his discharge on September \n27, 2023. These services were insufficient. EOHHS requires these services to be provided \n10 hours per week at minimum; J.C. only received three hours per week. He also received \none hour per week of cognitive behavioral therapy, for a total of four hours of treatment \nper week, far below the intensity and frequency J.C. needs. \n105. J.C.โs treating professionals recommended additional types of services, but it appears J.C. \nwas never referred or evaluated for such services. \n106. In March 2024, J.C.โs treating professionals determined his services needed to increase to \nthree times per week. However, J.C. only received two sessions, or six hours, per week. \nJ.C.โs cognitive behavioral therapy increased, though only by one hour per week, due to \nincreased dysregulation.  \n107. On or about July 22, 2024, J.C. was readmitted to the partial hospitalization program. By \nmid-October 2024, J.C.โs treatment team discussed discharge to a lower level of care. \nHowever, because of changes in housing and the lack of Intensive Home and \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 29 of 68 PageID #:\n29\n \n \nCommunity-Based Services necessary to meet J.C.โs needs, he was admitted for inpatient \ntreatment at the hospital. \n108. Defendants have failed to ensure J.C.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which he is entitled, J.C. is and will \nbe unnecessarily institutionalized. \n109. J.C., by his next friend, desires intensive behavioral health services in his home and other \ncommunity-based settings. \nG.  Plaintiff J.L.A. \n110. Plaintiff J.L.A. is a 13-year-old Medicaid-eligible youth from West Warwick, Rhode \nIsland. He is a triplet, along with Plaintiffs J.S.A. and K.A. J.L.A. brings this action \nthrough his mother and next friend, R.X. \n111. J.L.A.โs family describes him as having a very sweet side. He loves basketball and \nwatching football. \n112.  J.L.A. is diagnosed with co-occurring SED and DD: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Cerebral Palsy, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation \nDisorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and \nReactive Attachment Disorder. \n113. Qualified professionals have determined that J.L.A.โs mental and developmental \nconditions substantially limit his ability to engage in major life activities, including his \nfunctioning in family, school, and community activities. \n114. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration he needs and to which he is \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 30 of 68 PageID #:\n30\n \n \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected J.L.A.โs mental health. Although his mother, \nR.X., repeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep \nJ.L.A. safely at home, he was repeatedly institutionalized and segregated in hospitals and \nresidential settings.  \n115. J.L.A. is DCYF-involved through its Division of Family Services. Yet he does not \nreceive Intensive Care Coordination from or through DCYF. \n116. In or about 2016 or 2017, J.L.A. received one model of Intensive Home and Community-\nBased Services from a provider agency. Although these services were clinically \nrecommended and effective for J.L.A., DCYF decided those services were inappropriate \nbecause of J.L.A.โs co-occurring developmental disabilities. Over the objection of his \ntreating psychologist, DCYF discontinued the services. \n117. Between September 2021 and May 2023, J.L.A. was hospitalized three different times, \nthe longest of which lasted 265 days. Each time, he was readmitted to the hospital within \n30 days of being discharged. \n118. He also spent 138 days in residential placements. In total, J.L.A. spent 403 of 614 days \n(1.1 years), or 65% of that period, in out-of-home placements. \n119. From May 2023 to June 2023, J.L.A. received only a fraction of the services for which he \nhad been approved. \n120. In June 2023, J.L.A. was admitted to the hospital for another six months. \n121. As of January 4, 2024, J.L.A. resides in a congregate care facility in New Hampshire. His \nmother must travel 2.5 hours each way to participate in J.L.A.โs treatment. \n122. Defendants have failed to ensure J.L.A.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 31 of 68 PageID #:\n31\n \n \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which he is entitled, J.L.A. is and \nwill be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n123. J.L.A. desires intensive behavioral health services in his home and other community-\nbased settings. \nH.  Plaintiff J.S.A. \n124. Plaintiff J.S.A. is a 13-year-old Medicaid-eligible youth from West Warwick, Rhode \nIsland. He is a triplet, along with Plaintiffs J.L.A. and K.A. J.S.A. brings this action \nthrough his mother and next friend, R.X. \n125. J.S.A.โs family describes him as caring, helpful, and hard working. He loves electronics \nand computers. He also likes doing laundry and going to the laundromat. \n126. J.S.A. is diagnosed with co-occurring SED and DD, including Autism Spectrum \nDisorder, Intellectual Disability, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, \nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, \nObsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. \n127. Qualified professionals have determined that J.S.A.โs mental and developmental \nconditions substantially limit his ability to engage in major life activities, including his \nfunctioning in family, school, and community activities. \n128. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration he needs and to which he is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected J.S.A.โs mental health. Although his mother, \nR.X., repeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep \nJ.S.A. safely at home, he was institutionalized and segregated in hospitals.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 32 of 68 PageID #:\n32\n \n \n129. J.S.A. is DCYF-involved through its Division of Family Services. Yet he does not \nreceive Intensive Care Coordination from or through DCYF. \n130. Between July 2022 and August 2024, J.S.A. was hospitalized six separate times, totaling \n462 days, and spent an additional 103 days in residential placements. In other words, in a \nperiod of 740 days, J.S.A. spent 565 of them (1.5 years), or 76% of that period, in out-of-\nhome placements. \n131. In March 2024, the hospital prepared to discharge J.S.A. to his familyโs home and \nreferred him to a provider agency for a particular model of services. However, the agency \nplaced J.S.A. on a six- to seven-month waitlist. Rather than being discharged as planned, \nJ.S.A. remained at the hospital for another two months. J.S.A. was finally discharged on \nMay 13. \n132. Although J.S.A.โs treatment team determined he needed outpatient therapy, there is no \nevidence he was ever referred for this service. \n133. On June 14, 2024, J.S.A. was readmitted to an inpatient hospital unit.  \n134. On July 12, 2024, the hospital reported that J.S.A. had been informally accepted to a \nresidential placement but had to wait for a bed to become available. Although the hospital \nindicated a willingness to discharge J.S.A. immediately if he had in-home services, those \nservices were not yet in place. J.S.A. therefore remained in the hospital. \n135. On July 29, 2024, the provider agency discharged J.S.A. from services because he had \ntransitioned to a congregate care setting in New Hampshire. J.S.A. is in the same \nplacement as J.L.A.; his mother must travel 2.5 hours each way to participate in J.S.A.โs \ntreatment. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 33 of 68 PageID #:\n33\n \n \n136. Defendants have failed to ensure J.S.A.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which he is entitled, J.S.A. is and \nwill be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n137. J.S.A. desires intensive behavioral health services in his home and other community-\nbased settings. \nI.   Plaintiff K.A. \n138. Plaintiff K.A. is a 13-year-old Medicaid-eligible youth from West Warwick, Rhode \nIsland. She is a triplet, along with Plaintiffs J.L.A. and J.S.A. K.A. brings this action \nthrough her mother and next friend, R.X. \n139. K.A.โs family describes her as sweet and helpful. She loves music, and arts and crafts. \nWhen at home, she likes helping care for her infant niece and nephew. She carries \npictures of them with her at her current residential placement, and constantly asks about \nthem. \n140. K.A. is diagnosed with co-occurring SED and DD: Intellectual Disability, Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, Disruptive Mood \nDysregulation Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. \n141. Qualified professionals have determined that K.A.โs mental and developmental \nconditions substantially limit her ability to engage in major life activities, including her \nfunctioning in family, school, and community activities. \n142. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration she needs and to which she is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected K.A.โs mental health. Although her mother, R.X., \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 34 of 68 PageID #:\n34\n \n \nrepeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep K.A. \nsafely at home, she was institutionalized and segregated in hospitals and residential \nsettings.  \n143. K.A. recently became DCYF-involved, only after counsel expressly requested DCYF \nintervene to prevent a hospital from discharging K.A. home without any services. As of \nthe time of filing, it is unknown whether K.A. will receive Intensive Care Coordination \nfrom or through DCYF. \n144. Between December 2016 and June 2024, K.A. was hospitalized three different times. She \nalso spent another 463 days in residential placements based at that hospital. Twice, the \nhospital discharged K.A. to her home without any community-based services in place.  \n145. On June 20, 2024, the hospital discharged J.A. to her home. Her treating professionals \nreferred K.A. for a specific model of services. However, due to the inadequacy of the \nprovider network, K.A. did not receive them before her next hospitalization on June 28, \n2024. Further, despite the need for more intensive assistance, EOHHSโs Medicaid policy \nlimited the services K.A. received to 25 hours per week. \n146. The treating professionals also referred K.A. to a service that assists with activities of \ndaily living. Notably, the service is not appropriate for her. In the referral for this service, \nthe provider agency documented K.A.โs primary concerns as aggression and self-\ninjurious behavior. EOHHS defines this service as being inappropriate for individuals \ndisplaying aggression. \n147. Due to Defendantsโ failure to ensure access to Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices to support her safely at home, including access to Mobile Crisis Services, K.A \nwas readmitted to the hospital on June 28, 2024.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 35 of 68 PageID #:\n35\n \n \n148. On August 14, 2024, the community provider discharged K.A. from its services, as K.A. \nhad transitioned to a hospital-based residential program. She remains there as of the date \nof this Complaint. \n149. As of November 5, 2024, the hospital-based residential program intended to discharge \nK.A. home, without any services, for a third time. \n150. Defendants have failed to ensure K.A.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which she is entitled, K.A. is and \nwill be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n151. K.A. desires intensive behavioral health services in her home and other community-based \nsettings. \nJ.  Plaintiff A.C. \n152. Plaintiff A.C. is a 14-year-old Medicaid recipient from Johnston, Rhode Island. She \nbrings this action through her parents and next friends, K.C. and R.C. \n153. A.C. is a very happy young teenager who generally enjoys school and likes to stick to her \nschedule. She likes to be outside, swim, go on carnival rides, and listen and dance to \nmusic. She gets sad each Sunday night when she knows her visit home is over and she \nhas to return to her residential placement. \n154. A.C. is diagnosed with co-occurring SED and DD: Autism Spectrum Disorder, \nDepression, Anxiety Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. \n155. Qualified professionals have determined that A.C.โs mental and developmental \nconditions substantially limit her ability to engage in major life activities, including her \nfunctioning in family, school, and community activities. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 36 of 68 PageID #:\n36\n \n \n156. Defendantsโ failure to provide Intensive Home and Community-Based Services in a \ntimely manner, and in the intensity, frequency, and duration she needs and to which she is \nlegally entitled, has negatively affected A.C.โs mental health. Although K.C. and R.C. \nrepeatedly sought community-based behavioral health services in order to keep A.C. \nsafely at home, she was repeatedly institutionalized in hospitals. Her last hospitalization \nlasted more than 400 consecutive days. \n157. A.C. is involved with DCYF through its Division of Community Services and Behavioral \nHealth. She does not receive Intensive Care Coordination from or through DCYF. \n158. In early 2020, Plaintiff A.C. obtained a communication device to support her limited \nverbal communication. Because DCYF failed to provide Intensive Care Coordination and \ndid not ensure A.C. had a comprehensive treatment plan across school and the hospital, \nA.C. is no longer able to use this device. \n159. When A.C. was discharged from a hospitalization in or around late 2021 or early 2022, \nthe necessary Intensive Home and Community-Based Services were unavailable to her. \nAlthough in-home services were medically necessary and the appropriate level of care for \nA.C., DCYF failed to address the lack of such services. Instead, DCYF pushed for out-of-\nstate residential placement. In a final effort by her parents to keep her in Rhode Island, \nA.C. was placed in a hospital-based residential facility which, at the time of her \nadmission, served only males. \n160. As of the date of filing, A.C. remains at the residential facility. She receives educational \nservices at a center-based program specifically for children with Autism Spectrum \nDisorder. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 37 of 68 PageID #:\n37\n \n \n161. Defendants have failed to ensure A.C.โs access to medically necessary Intensive Home \nand Community-Based Services with reasonable promptness and/or at the frequency, \nintensity, or duration needed. Without the services to which she is entitled, A.C. is and \nwill be unnecessarily institutionalized. \n162. A.C. desires intensive behavioral health services in her home and other community-based \nsettings. \nII.  DEFENDANTS \n163. The Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (โEOHHSโ) is the \nโsingle state agencyโ responsible for administering Rhode Islandโs Medicaid program \nand for compliance with all federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(5); 42 C.F.R. ยง \n431.10; R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-7.2-2.  \n164. Defendant Richard Charest, who is being sued in his official capacity, is the Secretary of \nEOHHS. As Secretary, he is responsible for supervising EOHHS and managing its \ndepartments. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-7.2-4. Defendant Charest is also responsible for \noverseeing Rhode Islandโs Medicaid program and โensuring the laws are faithfully \nexecuted.โ R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-7.2-5. \n165. The Department of Children, Youth and Families (โDCYFโ), a department within \nEOHHS, is responsible for the delivery of mental health services to children with serious \nemotional disturbances, and children with functional developmental disabilities. R.I. Gen. \nLaws ยง 42-72-5(a)-(b). DCYF approves and makes referrals for residential treatment and \ninstitutionalization. \n166. Defendant Ashley Deckert, who is being sued in her official capacity, is the Director of \nDCYF.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 38 of 68 PageID #:\n38\n \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA. THE FEDERAL MEDICAID ACT AND THE EARLY AND PERIODIC \nSCREENING, DIAGNOSTIC, AND TREATMENT SERVICES (โEPSDTโ) \nPROVISIONS \n \n167. Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides federal funding to help \nstates deliver medical assistance to low-income individuals and families. See 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396. \n168. States that choose to participate in the program must submit a plan for medical assistance \nthat designates a โsingle State agencyโ responsible for administering and supervising the \nplan in compliance with federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(5).  \n169. Federal law mandates that states provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and \nTreatment (โEPSDTโ) services for Medicaid-eligible children under the age of 21. 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 1396d(a)(4)(B). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (โCMSโ)โthe federal agency responsible for the Medicare and Medicaid \nprogramsโhas emphasized that the โEPSDT benefit is more robust than the Medicaid \nbenefit for adults and is designed to assure that children receive early detection and care, \nso that health problems are averted or diagnosed and treated as early as possible.โ \n170. Under the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act, states must ensure children have \naccess to all medically necessary services, including Intensive Home and Community-\nBased Services, that fit within any of the categories of Medicaid-covered services listed \nin Section 1905(a) of the Medicaid Act. A service is medically necessary if it is needed to \ncorrect or ameliorate a childโs mental or behavioral health condition. Notably, a treatment \nor service does not need to โcureโ a condition to be covered under EPSDT. Services that \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 39 of 68 PageID #:\n39\n \n \nmaintain or improve a childโs current health condition must also be covered, as they can \nprevent conditions from worsening and the development of more costly illnesses. Such \nservices must be covered regardless of whether they are included in the State Plan or \nMedicaid Waiver programs. \n171. Federal law further requires states to arrange or provide these services to Medicaid-\neligible children and youth โwith reasonable promptness.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(8). \nStates must โmake available a variety of individual and group providers qualified and \nwilling to provideโ services to children. 42 C.F.R. ยง 441.61(b). CMS has confirmed that \nโ[a] number of Medicaid and EPSDT provisions are intended to assure that children have \naccess to an adequate number and range of pediatric providers.โ A lack of providers does \nnot excuse states from complying with the โreasonable promptnessโ requirement. \nWaitlists for medically necessary services also violate the Medicaid Actโs โreasonable \npromptnessโ requirement. \n172. States can administer EPSDT services directly, through fee-for-service arrangements, or \nby overseeing private entities (such as managed care organizations) contracted to \nadminister the benefit. Regardless of the method, states remain ultimately responsible for \nensuring Medicaid-eligible children can access the services they need to address their \nmental and behavioral health conditions. \nB.  THE ADA, THE INTEGRATION MANDATE, AND SECTION 504 OF THE \nREHABILITATION ACT \n \n173. The Americans with Disabilities Act (โADAโ) was enacted โto provide a clear and \ncomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101(b)(1). The ADA acknowledges that โsociety has \ntended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,โ and that โdiscrimination \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 40 of 68 PageID #:\n40\n \n \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue[s] to be a serious and pervasive social \nproblem.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101(a)(2). \n174. Under Title II of the ADA, โno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 12132; 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130. \n175. The Plaintiffs and similarly situated youth they represent are โqualified individuals with \ndisabilitiesโ as defined by the ADA and its regulations. 42 U.S.C. ยง 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. \nยง 35.104. A disability is defined as โ(A) a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of \nsuch an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.โ 42 U.S.C. \nยง 12102(1); 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.108. \n176. Defendants are public entities, and administer Rhode Islandโs Medicaid program through \npublic entities, subject to the ADAโs nondiscrimination requirements.  \n177. Public entities must โprovide services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.โ 28 C.F.R. \nยง 35.130(d). The โmost integrated settingโ is defined as one that โenables individuals \nwith disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.โ 28 \nC.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B. Additionally, the ADAโs implementing regulations prohibit public \nentities from using โcriteria or methods of administration . . . [t]hat have the effect of \nsubjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of \ndisabilityโ or that โhave the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 41 of 68 PageID #:\n41\n \n \naccomplishment of the objectives of the public entityโs program with respect to \nindividuals with disabilities.โ 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130(b)(3).  \n178. Public entities must also โmake reasonable modifications in [their] policies, practices, \nand proceduresโ to avoid discrimination, unless the public entity can demonstrate that the \nmodification would โfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.โ \n28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130(b)(7). \n179. In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court held that Title II of the \nADA prohibits the unjustified segregation of people with disabilities, ruling that \nunnecessary institutionalization constitutes discrimination under the ADA. Id. at 600, \n607. The Court explained that unnecessary institutionalization not only โperpetuates \nunwarranted assumptionsโ about individuals with disabilities, suggesting they are \nโincapable or unworthy of participating in community life,โ but also โseverely diminishes \nthe everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social \ncontactsโฆ[and] educational advancement.โ Id. at 600-1. \n180. Olmstead requires states to โprovide community-based treatment for persons with mental \ndisabilities when 1) []treatment professionals determine that such placement is \nappropriate, 2) the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and 3) the placement \ncan be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State \nand the needs of others with mental disabilities.โ Id. at 607. \n181. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice (โDOJโ) issued a statement on enforcement of \nthe integration mandate articulated in Olmstead. The DOJ clarified that โ[i]ntegrated \nsettings are those that provide individuals with disabilities opportunities to live, work, \nand receive services in the greater community, like individuals without disabilities.โ They \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 42 of 68 PageID #:\n42\n \n \nare โlocated in mainstream society; offer access to community activities and \nopportunities at times, frequencies and with persons of an individualโs choosing; afford \nindividuals choice in their daily life activities; and, provide individuals with disabilities \nthe opportunity to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.โ The \nDOJ emphasized that the integration mandate applies in cases where โa public entity \nadministers its programs in a manner that results in unjustified segregation of persons \nwith disabilities.โ The DOJ further noted that, pursuant to Olmstead, โ[i]ndividuals need \nnot wait until the harm of institutionalization or segregation occurs or is imminent.โ  \n182. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794, imposes similar requirements on \nprograms and activities that receive federal financial assistance. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. \nยง 41.51(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. ยง 84.4(b)(2).  \nC. RHODE ISLANDโS MEDICAID PROGRAM \n183. Rhode Island has opted into the Medicaid program and, as a result, must comply with \nMedicaid law and regulations to continue receiving federal funds.  \n184. EOHHS is the โsingle State agencyโ responsible for administering Rhode Island \nMedicaid in compliance with federal law. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-7.2-2. Rhode Island has \ndeveloped a State Plan, reviewed and approved by the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, that, along with federal law and regulations, forms the foundation of \nRhode Islandโs Medicaid program.  \n185. Rhode Island acknowledges that its Medicaid program must cover certain mandatory \nbenefits required by federal law, including childrenโs services under EPSDT. Rhode \nIsland extends EPSDT coverage to children up to age 19, Supplemental Security Income-\neligible children up to age 21, and youth aging out of foster care up to age 21. 210 R.I. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 43 of 68 PageID #:\n43\n \n \nCode R. ยง 30-05-2.8(A)(4). Youth transitioning to adult services are also eligible for \nEPSDT until age 21. Id. \n186. Rhode Island law guarantees Medicaid-eligible children and youth the right to receive \nโthe full scope of services covered under the Medicaid State Plan and the Stateโs Section \n1115 waiverโ as well as coverage for โall follow-up diagnostic and treatment services \ndeemed medically necessary to ameliorate or correct defects andโฆmental illness and \nconditions discovered through screening or at any other occasion, whether or not those \nservices are covered by the State Medicaid Plan or the Stateโs Medicaid Section 1115 \nwaiver.โ Id. A โmedically necessary serviceโ is defined as a service โrequired for the \nprevention, diagnosis, cure, or treatment of a health-related condition including any such \nservices that are necessary to prevent a detrimental change inโฆmental health status.โ 210 \nR.I. Code R. ยง 30-05-2.8(A)(3). Medically necessary services โmust be provided in the \nmost cost-efficient and appropriate setting and must not be provided solely for the \nconvenience of theโฆ service provider.โ Id. \n187. Rhode Island does not administer childrenโs mental health services through a different \nagency from childrenโs developmental disability services. Nor does it fund services \nseparately depending on the childโs diagnosis. Services for children with co-occurring \nSED and DD are the same as those for children diagnosed only with SED, though \nchildren with co-occurring disabilities may require modifications and accommodations \nrelated to their DD. \n188. DCYF, an agency within EOHHS, is responsible for administering a statewide network \nof supports to protect vulnerable children and families. It has statutory authority over \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 44 of 68 PageID #:\n44\n \n \nchildrenโs behavioral health services for all children in Rhode Island. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง \n42-72-5(a)-(b). \n189. DCYF is tasked with โdevelop[ing] a design of a continuum of care for childrenโs \nbehavioral health services that encourages the use of alternative psychiatric and other \nservices to hospitalization and review[ing] the utilization of each service in order to better \nmatch services and programs to the needs of the children and families as well as \ncontinuously improve the quality of and access to services.โ R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 42-72-5.2. \n190. Children and youth in Rhode Island access behavioral health services, including mental \nhealth and developmental disability services, through DCYF. Youth receiving child \nwelfare services from DCYF are served through its Division of Family Services.  \n191. Youth who are not in the care or custody of DCYF access services through its Division of \nCommunity Services and Behavioral Health. Youth must first access services when they \nare less than 18-years-old and may receive services through the age of 21. Parents are not \nrequired to relinquish custody or control of their children in order to access services \nthrough this Division. \n192. According to written DCYF policy, youth who access services through the Division of \nCommunity Services and Behavioral Health are to be assigned a Family Navigator, who \nis responsible for assessing Medicaid eligibility and assisting the family in applying for \nMedicaid as needed. The Family Navigator is also responsible for conducting a Level of \nNeed Assessment to identify appropriate services, which are funded through private \nhealth insurance, Medicaid, and/or DCYF funds. Once appropriate services are identified, \nthe Family Navigator is tasked with referring the child to those services. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 45 of 68 PageID #:\n45\n \n \n193. In practice, Plaintiff parents report a different experience. For example, when Plaintiff \nJ.C.โs mother, C.C., attempted to access services through DCYF, she was told to contact \nher husbandโs private insurance company, and did not receive any assistance or \nassessment from DCYF.  \n194. Recently, Rhode Island transitioned several of its Community Mental Health Centers \n(โCMHCโ) into Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (โCCBHCโ). Under the \nprior CMHC system, the state contracted with six providers to deliver behavioral health \nservices statewide. However, the CMHC model was consistently plagued by provider \nshortages and long waitlists, leaving Plaintiffs without timely access to medically \nnecessary behavioral health services.  \n195. Defendants have long been aware that the stateโs Medicaid program, including the \nCMHC service delivery model, lacked network adequacy. Audits of Rhode Islandโs \nMedicaid Managed Care plans consistently revealed a severe lack of access to children \nand adolescent behavioral health services. In 2022, one managed care organization \n(โMCOโ) audit showed that only six out of 30 providers (20%) had routine appointments \navailable for childrenโs behavioral health, and only 10% of appointments were timely. \nAnother MCO audit found that only three out of ten providers (30%) had available \nroutine appointments for childrenโs behavioral health, none of which were timely. \n196. Rhode Island anticipates the transition to the CCBHC model will resolve these issues. \nCCBHCs are required to serve all individuals seeking behavioral health careโincluding \nchildren and youthโwithout waitlists. However, there is inadequate evidence that \nDefendants have taken sufficient steps, including building the needed service provider \ncapacity, to ensure that CCBHCs will actually deliver on those promised outcomes. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 46 of 68 PageID #:\n46\n \n \n197. Defendants themselves have acknowledged that โnot all prospective CCBHCs will begin \noperations in FY 2025, nor will those that are starting [] be fully staffed in FY 2025.โ  \n198. Defendants have further acknowledged that the transition to the CCBHC system may not \nlead to improved access to behavioral health care. EOHHS has admitted that โCCBHC \ncosts and visits are highly uncertain in the first year of the program,โ and that โit is \nunknown the extent to which providers will be able to hire more staff and to what extent \nbehavioral health service utilization will increase with the new program.โ  \nII.  PLAINTIFFS NEED INTENSIVE COMMUNITY-BASED BEHAVIORAL \nHEALTH SERVICES TO ADDRESS THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH \nNEEDS WITHOUT RESORTING TO HOSPITALIZATION OR OTHER \nINSTITUTIONALIZATION. \n \n199.  The Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (โCMCSโ) has cautioned that โ[w]ithout \ntreatment, children with behavioral health conditions face a range of problems in \nadulthood, including increased risk of criminal justice involvement and instability in \nemployment and relationships.โ \n200.  CMCS has further emphasized that states have โbroad flexibilityโ to design comprehensive \ncare plans that cover a continuum of services, including โintensive community-based \nservices, crisis stabilization, and intensive care coordination.โ According to CMCS, states \nare required to โensure coverage and reimbursement are available for services at an \nintermediate level of care, such as intensive in-home services, partial hospitalization \nservices, and wrap around services, to correct or ameliorate identified behavioral health \nconditions.โ \n201.  The Intensive Home and Community-Based Services at issue in this case are not only \nmedically necessary; they are life-changing. Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices allow children and youth to receive essential treatment for their disabilities while \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 47 of 68 PageID #:\n47\n \n \nremaining in their homes and communities, enabling them to participate in important \naspects of childhood such as attending school, playing sports, exploring hobbies, and \nmaintaining social relationships.  \n202.  For children with co-occurring SED and DD, Defendantsโ failure to provide or arrange for \nmedically necessary Intensive Home and Community-Based Services is even more dire. \nUnmet behavioral health needs in children with DD impact the ability to successfully \ntransition to school and the transition from school to adulthood. For children with DD and \nbehavioral health needs, gaps in a full continuum of appropriate and coordinated behavioral \nhealth services can create health and safety issues, including trauma, criminalization of \ntheir behavior, inappropriate use of medication to control behavior, and difficulties in \ndeveloping coping skills.  \n203.  Children with co-occurring SED and DD require integrated multidisciplinary supports. \nThey may require adaptations to behavioral health services due to the symptoms of their \ndisabilities, such as expressive and receptive language skills. Sessions may need to be \nshorter and more frequent, and therapy may require more structure. Training for clinicians \nis critical; staff in the mental health system often feel unprepared to care for individuals \nwith co-occurring DD.  \n204.  Publicly available information clearly shows that Defendants do not ensure Plaintiffs have \naccess to Intensive Care Coordination services, Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services, or \nMobile Crisis Services in a timely manner and/or with the intensity, frequency, and \nduration that is medically necessary.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 48 of 68 PageID #:\n48\n \n \nA. DEFENDANTS KNOW AND ADMIT THEY DO NOT ENSURE \nPLAINTIFFSโ ACCESS TO INTENSIVE HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED \nSERVICES. \n \n205.  Since at least 2015, EOHHS has acknowledged a persistent โscarcity of mental health \nprofessionalsโ that results in waiting lists, which โare one outward sign of a lack of \nsufficient access to care and resources.โ EOHHS knows that capacity is โa key factor in \nlow outreach, access, and quality satisfaction ratings.โ EOHHS has further admitted that \nโthe workforce crisis impacts every aspect of support and care, which then decreases \ncapacity and increases access and quality concernsโฆ An overall pervasive workforce \ndeficit is a fault line impactingโฆ the full continuum of support and services.โ \n206.  Recognizing that it needed โto assess gaps in the [behavioral health] system, identify \npolicy and implementation priorities, and establish implementation plans for those \npriorities,โ EOHHS hired the Faulkner Consulting Group (โFaulkner Group) in 2021. The \nFaulkner Group confirmed that โ[a]ccess to childrenโs [behavioral health] services is [a] \nsignificant challenge for RI families, and for RI providers trying to match treatment level \nneed with available capacity.โ The Faulkner Group identified โsignificant shortagesโ in \nhome based therapeutic services, as well as โmoderate shortagesโ in enhanced outpatient \nservices, home and community-based services, and mobile crisis services. The Faulkner \nGroup also warned that โ[t]he gap in inpatient/acute services appears to be driven by the \nlack of crisis intervention and community wrap around support and prevention.โ \n207.  The Faulkner Group highlighted the inadequate provider network as a critical issue, \nfinding that Rhode Islandโs workforce recruitment and retention challenges were driven \nin part by low wages and insufficient reimbursement. It warned: โThere are high turnover \nrates among [behavioral health] providers, and providers may opt to go into private \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 49 of 68 PageID #:\n49\n \n \npractice[,] accept cash-only payments or move to bordering states with higher \nreimbursement options. Workforce shortages have led to a lack of capacity to meet \n[behavioral health] need.โ The Group also specifically noted the lack of โqualified \nspecialty providers,[] particularly for community-based services for children.โ   \n208.  The Faulkner Group did not just identify problems; it proposed solutions: โOur \nrecommendation is not to build additional inpatient capacity, rather to invest resources in \nbetter community support to alleviate the bottleneck for the existing inpatient beds.โ It \nobserved treatment capacity challenges โcould be driven by insufficient access to \nprevention.โ \n209.  In 2022, EOHHS openly admitted that the stateโs behavioral health crisis was โstill not \nbeing adequately addressed.โ It acknowledged that Rhode Island โranks 33rd in overall \nchild behavioral health outcomesโ and โ[i]n the majority of behavioral health metrics, \nRhode Island ranks worse than the US average.โ It also acknowledged that โ[t]he \ninadequacy of the Rhode Island behavioral health systemโ is due in part to being \nโunderfunded for years, [leading] to workforce shortages, siloed state agency approaches \nand policies, and waiting lists that leave families at risk.โ \n210.  EOHHS pledged to improve, declaring that Rhode Island โmust commit to raising [itself] \nto the top of the United States with the metrics where we are low.โ In 2023, it outlined \nbroad goals, including developing a strong continuum of care, ensuring that procured \nservices meet identified needs, addressing service gaps, and increasing accountability in \nservice provision. EOHHS admitted, โWe do have the tools to accomplish this.โ  \n211.  Yet the same inadequacies in the system persist today. In May 2024, the DOJ confirmed, \nโCurrent DCYF-contracted providers offering long-term, intensive, high-acuity, \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 50 of 68 PageID #:\n50\n \n \ncommunity-based care do not serve a sufficient number of children to avoid the \nunnecessary hospitalization of children.โ \n212. On October 17, 2024, a report released by the Rhode Island Coalition for Children and \nFamilies (โRICCFโ) made clear that childrenโs access to intensive behavioral services \nremains โhighly limited.โ \n213. Defendants recognize the need to ensure children with SED and co-occurring DD have \naccess to appropriate services. In 2020, EOHHS requested that the Center for START \nServices at the University of New Hampshire (โthe Centerโ) conduct a study of Rhode \nIslandโs services for individuals with co-occurring mental health and developmental \ndisabilities. The Center identified the need to expand capacity for services, as treatment \nprofessionals who are qualified to treat individuals with developmental disabilities โare \nnot always accessible and the services available do not always appropriately meet \nidentified needs.โ Further, improved coordination and information sharing is required. \nFinally, the Center found a lack of crisis response services for people with developmental \ndisabilities, particularly due to the lack of training to respond to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities who are experiencing a mental health crisis. \n214. The Center recommended that EOHHS implement a START pilot to serve approximately \n450-600 youth over a four-year period. Although EOHHS publicly announced financial \nsupport for the pilot, it was later removed from the budget.  \n215. Nor has EOHHS otherwise ensured that specialized community-based behavioral health \nservices are available for youth with SED and co-occurring DD, a fact confirmed by the \nDOJ.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 51 of 68 PageID #:\n51\n \n \n216.  As a result, Plaintiffs and similarly situated youth, who have SED, including co-occurring \nSED and DD, are denied medically necessary behavioral health services to which they \nare entitled. \nB.  PLAINTIFFS LACK ACCESS TO INTENSIVE CARE COORDINATION. \n217. Intensive Care Coordination is an Intensive Home and Community-Based Service \ndesigned for children and youth with complex behavioral health needs who, like \nPlaintiffs, require services and supports from multiple providers, systems, and agencies. \nIntensive Care Coordination goes beyond traditional case management by offering \nfamilies a coordinated approach to accessing these essential services. Both CMCS and \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (โSAMHSAโ) have \nrecognized that Intensive Care Coordination includes โassessment and service planning, \naccessing and arranging for services, coordinating multiple services, including access to \nservicesโฆand monitoring progress.โ It has been proven to significantly improve \noutcomes for children and youth. It is covered under Medicaid as a case management \nand/or rehabilitative service. 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1396d(a)(13), (a)(19); 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1396n(g)(2); 42 C.F.R. ยงยง 440.130(d), 440.169, 441.18. \n218.  EOHHS knows that Intensive Care Coordination is necessary for Plaintiffs and similarly \nsituated youth, acknowledging that children with โserious emotional and/or behavioral \ndisturbances and multiple system involvementโฆwill require intensive coordination of \nservices and supports.โ But the Faulkner Group revealed that in Rhode Island, โ[c]are \ncoordination is often overlapping and duplicated, which can be both ineffective and \nconfusing for clients.โ  \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 52 of 68 PageID #:\n52\n \n \n219.  EOHHS acknowledges that โ[t]raditional case management, [Managed Care \nOrganization] care coordination, or health home approaches are often not sufficient for \nchildren and youth with significant behavioral health challenges.โ And yet, 38% of \nrespondents to a 2024 EOHHS assessment reported access concerns with targeted case \nmanagement, and 33% highlighted access concerns with wraparound services (of which \nIntensive Care Coordination is a component) for children and families. EOHHS \nidentified โa phenomenon referred to as โcase management fatigue,โ in which individuals \nin the field are constantly facing waiting lists and being unable to connect the people they \nare working with to needed support and services due to a range of dead ends.โ  \n220. Plaintiffsโ experiences are illustrative.  \na.  The only case management service A.C. received is the very Managed Care \nOrganization care coordination that EOHHS admits is inadequate.  \nb.  Neither Plaintiffs L.A. nor J.C. receive Intensive Care Coordination services from \nDCYF, as they are not DCYF-involved.  \nc.  J.L.A. and J.S.A., who are DCYF-involved, also do not receive care coordination \nservices. Instead, their mother and next friend, R.X., researches and seeks out \nservices for her children, then communicates the desire for those services to \nDCYF, so DCYF can evaluate whether and how to pay for the services. \nd.  E.L., E.M., and T.C. are involved with DCYF but do not receive Intensive Care \nCoordination services. D.R.V. is also involved with DCYF; upon information and \nbelief, DCYF does not provide her with care coordination services. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 53 of 68 PageID #:\n53\n \n \nC. PLAINTIFFS LACK ACCESS TO INTENSIVE IN-HOME BEHAVIORAL \nSERVICES. \n \n221. Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services are designed to provide therapeutic interventions \ndirectly to children and families in their homes and community settings, with the goal of \nimproving the childโs functioning and preventing out-of-home placements in hospitals or \ncongregate care settings. Both CMCS and SAMHSA emphasize that Intensive In-Home \nBehavioral Services should include individual and family therapy, behavioral \ninterventions, and skills training, with staff maintaining small caseloads to allow for \nintensive, personalized care. \n222. Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services have been proven to significantly improve \noutcomes for children and youth. Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services are covered \nunder Medicaid as rehabilitative services.  \n223. EOHHS acknowledges that โ[a] comprehensive system of care will have available a wide \narray of community servicesโ including โintensive in-home services.โ However, it has \nadmitted that โ[a]t higher levels of acuity, there are limited intensive in-home behavioral \nhealth treatment options, which constrains the possibility of offering behavioral health \nservices in the least-restrictive setting appropriate.โ It further conceded that the โmajor \ngapโ in Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services is โbelieved to be driving children and \nyouth to inpatient care in greater numbers than before and/or lengthening in-patient \nstays.โ \n224. EOHHS has also acknowledged the need to โexpand Intensive Home and Community \nBased Services to remove waitlists.โ It has indicated โ[t]he initial focus should be on \nincreasing the state-wide capacity ofโฆintensive in-home behavioral health servicesโ by \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 54 of 68 PageID #:\n54\n \n \nโutiliz[ing] mental health and educational stimulus dollars to expand, enhance, and \nincrease school and community-based childrenโs behavioral health services.โ \n225.  In May 2024, the DOJ concluded its investigation into Rhode Islandโs behavioral health \nsystem for children and youth. The DOJ subsequently issued a Letter of Findings, which \nrevealed that โthere are fewer providers who possess the specialized training necessary to \nprovide the intense behavioral health supports needed by the focus population.โ The DOJ \nfound that โ[f]or various community-based programs, the State has failed to ensure \nadequate reimbursement rates for providers of home and community-based behavioral \nhealth services.โ Inadequate reimbursement rates have โled to providers being unable to \nmeet demand for community-based services, resulting in gaps in the service array and \nextended waits for behavioral health services.โ The DOJ concluded that โDCYF has not \nleveraged federal funds or resources across state agencies to invest in building the \ncapacity of providers to support youth with intense behavioral support needs.โ  \n226. Plaintiffs are unable to obtain medically necessary Intensive In-Home Behavioral \nServices because the services do not exist, are not provided with reasonable promptness, \nand/or are not provided at the intensity, frequency, and/or duration that is medically \nnecessary. Plaintiffsโ experiences demonstrate this:  \na.  Plaintiff T.C. was on a waitlist for medically necessary Intensive In-Home \nBehavioral Services. Due to Defendantsโ failure to ensure access to the services \nhe needed with reasonable promptness, T.C. remained in a psychiatric residential \ntreatment facility despite being ready for discharge. He received no clinical or \nbehavioral health services during that period.  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 55 of 68 PageID #:\n55\n \n \nb.  E.L.โs treating physician determined in March 2023 that Intensive In-Home \nBehavioral Services were medically necessary for them. They languished at St. \nMaryโs for 15 months, spending more than 150 of those days on a waitlist for \nplacement, due to Defendantsโ failure to ensure E.L.โs access to medically \nnecessary services. \nc.  D.R.V. likewise languished at St. Maryโs for six months while waiting for \nmedically necessary Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services. She was ultimately \ndischarged without any behavioral health services, intensive or otherwise. \nd.  Plaintiffs are unable to access Intensive In-Home Behavioral Services with \nreasonable promptness and/or in the intensity, frequency, and duration they \nrequire. Neither Plaintiffs J.C. nor L.A. received even the minimum amount of \nservices that EOHHS mandates, much less the amount necessary to ameliorate \ntheir conditions. Nor, upon information and belief, did J.C.โs provider implement \naccommodations consistently to ensure equal access to the services due to his co-\noccurring DD.  \ne.  In early 2020, Plaintiff A.C. obtained a communication device to support her \nlimited verbal communication. Upon information and belief, Defendant DCYF \nfailed to coordinate with A.C.โs school and hospital regarding the device, and \nA.C. is no longer able to use it. \nf.  K.A. was twice discharged home from the hospital without any services, intensive \nor otherwise, despite clear medical necessity for Intensive In-Home Behavioral \nServices. When she was discharged with a type of service in June 2024, \nDefendants failed to ensure access to that service at the intensity that was \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 56 of 68 PageID #:\n56\n \n \nmedically necessary, due solely to her needs exceeding the EOHHS-mandated \nmaximum hours for those services. As of November 5, 2024, the hospital again \ndiscussed discharging K.A. without services in place; the service for which she \nwas referred has a six-month waitlist. \ng.  J.S.A. was placed on a waitlist for services, languishing in the hospital for two \nmonths until the services became available to him. Defendants failed to ensure he \nwas able to access all medically necessary services in a timely manner; 31 days \nlater, J.S.A. was re-hospitalized. \nh.  DCYF reportedly discontinued J.L.A.โs services despite the explicit disagreement \nof his treating physician, simply because he has co-occurring DD. \nD. PLAINTIFFS LACK ACCESS TO MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES. \n227. Mobile Crisis Services, also an Intensive Home and Community-Based Service, provide \nimmediate intervention during mental and behavioral health crises experienced at home \nand in the community. They are covered under Medicaid as rehabilitative services. \n228. Both CMCS and SAMHSA have emphasized that Mobile Crisis Services are \nโinstrumental in defusing and de-escalating difficult mental health situations and \npreventing unnecessary out-of-home placements, particularly hospitalizations.โ Mobile \nCrisis Services have been proven to significantly improve outcomes for children and \nyouth. \n229. EOHHS acknowledges the importance of Mobile Crisis Services, noting their critical role \nin โinterced[ing] upstream, before urgent behavioral situations become unmanageable \nemergencies.โ It recognizes that Mobile Crisis Services โcan be instrumental in averting \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 57 of 68 PageID #:\n57\n \n \nunnecessary emergency department (ED) visits, psychiatric hospitalizations, out-of-home \nplacements, and placement disruptions, and in reducing overall system costs.โ \n230. Defendants further acknowledge implementing a mobile crisis response team โwould \nlikely result in savings as individuals are diverted away from the emergency room.โ But \nwhile Defendants know that states with Mobile Crisis Services โhave consistently \ndemonstrated cost savings while simultaneously improving outcomes and achieving \nhigher family satisfaction,โ they concede that Rhode Island still โcurrently lacks a \ncomprehensive statewide mobile crisis services system, leaving the State ill-equipped to \nhandle crisis events that occur outside of facility settings.โ   \n231. EOHHS attempted to address this gap by piloting Childrenโs Mobile Crisis and Response \nStabilization services in August 2020. Between August 2020 and April 2022, 202 youth \nreceived such services. Of those who completed their mobile crisis care plans, 74% were \nable to avoid hospitalization and were placed on an aftercare plan. However, the program \nwas still unable to serve all referred youth โdue to ongoing workforce challenges.โ And \ndespite the success of the pilot program, Defendants failed to ensure continued access to \nMobile Crisis Services for nearly one year. \n232. In November 2022, EOHHS restarted the Stateโs Mobile Response and Stabilization \nService by contracting with two providers. These providers offered โshort-term \nstabilization and case management for up to 30 days.โ  \n233. By November 2023, 464 children and youth experiencing crises had been served by \nMobile Crisis Services. According to DCYF, 92% were stabilized in the community \nwithout psychiatric hospitalization, โproviding strong evidence of the efficacy and need \nfor this service.โ By March 2024, the number of people served was over 500.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 58 of 68 PageID #:\n58\n \n \n234. Despite these improvements, EOHHS also found that 43% of respondents to its 2024 \nCommunity Needs Assessment still reported access concerns with crisis 24-hour mobile \nstabilization services. The DOJโs Letter of Findings further confirmed that Rhode \nIslandโs mobile crisis program is โonly starting to fill what has been previously described \nas an utter void in crisis services for children with behavioral-health disabilities.โ \n235. According to the October 17, 2024 RICCF report written by local stakeholders and \nproviders, Mobile Crisis Services continue to โlack[] permanent funding, as initial grant \ndollars are running out.โ RICCF concluded that โthe future of the MRSS [Mobile \nResponse and Stabilization Service] model and its stabilization focus remains uncertain.โ \n236. Due to insufficient access to Mobile Crisis Services, some youth are unnecessarily sent to \nthe hospital. For example, when Plaintiff K.A. was in crisis in June, she was not referred \nto Mobile Crisis. Instead, she was directed to the hospital, and subsequently admitted to \ninpatient treatment. \n237. Even where Mobile Crisis Services exist, they are far from robust and responsive. \nPlaintiff T.C. had a crisis, and his grandmother, D.T., called Mobile Crisis as T.C.โs \nprovider agency had instructed. No one answered the first time, so she left a message. No \none answered the second time, so she left another message. D.T. reported that it took \nanother two hours for someone to return her calls. By that time, T.C. had gone to the \nhospital. \nIII.  DEFENDANTSโ FAILURE TO PROVIDE PLAINTIFFS WITH INTENSIVE \nCOMMUNITY-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES RESULTS IN \nUNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION. \n \n238.  Defendantsโ ongoing failure to ensure Plaintiffs have timely, statewide access to Intensive \nHome and Community-Based Services also violates Plaintiffsโ rights under the ADA.  \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 59 of 68 PageID #:\n59\n \n \n239.  The ADA โprohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public programs, including \nMedicaid.โ This means services must be provided in the community, rather than in \ninstitutional settings, โwhen the need for community services can be reasonably \naccommodated and providing services in the community will not fundamentally alter the \nstateโs Medicaid program.โ  \n240.  Rhode Island law requires Defendants to develop a continuum of care that โencourages the \nuse of alternative psychiatric and other services to hospitalizationโ and which includes \nโcommunity-based prevention, family support, and crisis-intervention services.โ R.I. Gen. \nLaws ยง 42-72-5.2; ยง 42-72-5(b)(27). DCYF recognizes its responsibility for โdeveloping a \ncontinuum of care for childrenโs behavioral health services to support children within their \nfamily settingsโ and โin the least restrictive environment possible.โ \n241.  Yet Rhode Island relies on a variety of restrictive settings to treat children and youth with \nmental and behavioral health disabilities who could, with access to the Intensive Home and \nCommunity-Based Services at issue in this lawsuit, receive treatment while remaining in \ntheir homes and communities. Those restrictive settings include emergency rooms, hospital \ninpatient programs, psychiatric residential treatment facilities, and congregate care \nfacilities.  \n242.  EOHHS is aware that the โlack of capacity for outpatient care and services in the \ncommunity [] can lead to unnecessary utilization of more restrictive and more expensive \nlevels of careโฆand longer length of stay for inpatient care.โ However, the Faulkner Group \nobserved that Defendants have โsteadily shifted away from community-based services \ntoward inpatient services.โ According to the Group, the use of childrenโs residential \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 60 of 68 PageID #:\n60\n \n \npsychiatric services has โseen a significant increase,โ doubling from 2017 to 2019, while \nthe use of outpatient services has been decreasing. \n243.  DCYF has admitted that โchildrenโs behavioral health services [are]โฆtoo often carried out \nin more restrictive settings than necessary.โ Defendant Deckert publicly acknowledged that \nโsometimes kids linger in these [residential] settings longer than they should.โ As far back \nas 2010, Rhode Islandโs institutionalization rate had been considered among the โworst in \nthe nation and vastly above the national average.โ As of 2022, Rhode Islandโs rate of \ninstitutionalization is still 50% above the national average. \n244.  Even DCYFโs own data shows that a significant portion of children placed in congregate \nsettings could be served in community-based homes. DCYF uses a Level of Need (โLONโ) \nassessment to โclearly identify what each childโs needs are, what type of homes would be a \nbest fit for their needs, and what services might be needed.โ According to DCYF, โ[m]ost \nchildren and youth who are placed with foster families score at a 1, 2, or 3.โ And yet, \nnearly half of Rhode Island children and youth in restrictive treatment facilities have a \nLON Tier Score of 3 or lower.  \n245.  In May 2024, the DOJ concluded that Rhode Island violated Title II of the ADA and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by โfailing to provide services to children with \nbehavioral health disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs,โ \nresulting in children being โroutinely and unnecessarily segregated in an acute-care \npsychiatric hospital.โ Between 2017 and 2022, 527 children either in DCYF care or \nvoluntarily receiving services through DCYF were admitted to Bradley Hospital, a \npsychiatric hospital that exclusively treats children and youth. Many of these children were \nforced to remain hospitalized for far longer than medically necessary, with approximately \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 61 of 68 PageID #:\n61\n \n \n116 children (22%) staying for more than 100 consecutive days. Nearly 40% were re-\nhospitalized multiple times. Most were re-hospitalized with 30 days of discharge. \nCritically, the DOJ concluded that these extended hospital stays were the result of \nโDCYFโs failure to secure appropriate services to allow a child to safely live with his or her \nfamily or in another community setting.โ The DOJ investigation revealed that children with \nbehavioral health disabilities could be treated in less restrictive settings than hospitals, but \nmany remained hospitalized โsimply because DCYF has failed to ensure sufficient capacity \nof community-based services and prompt and effective discharge planning.โ The DOJ \nfurther noted that โ[t]he demand for community-based servicesโฆgreatly exceeds the \ncurrent supply,โ and โmany children require hospitalization because of the insufficient \nsupply of community-based services in the State.โ \n246.  As of August 2024, around 80 Rhode Island children were placed in out-of-state residential \npsychiatric facilitiesโwith some as far away as Idaho. Several of these facilities have been \nlinked to abuse, understaffing, and even deaths. But the Office of the Child Advocateโthe \ndesignated advocacy office for children in DCYF careโonly visits those out-of-state \nfacilities approximately once a year. The number of children placed in out-of-state facilities \nhas grown by 30% between 2022 and 2024. The amount DCYF spends on out-of-state \nfacilities has ballooned in that same period by over 2000%, from $71,380 to $1.98 million.  \n247.  Plaintiffs are but a few examples of the routine and unnecessary segregation of youth with \nbehavioral health needs in Rhode Island.  \na.  All ten Plaintiffs have experienced at least one in-patient hospitalization; most \nhave been hospitalized repeatedly.  \nb.  At just six years old, J.C. is currently hospitalized in an in-patient psychiatric unit. \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 62 of 68 PageID #:\n62\n \n \nc.  L.A. was hospitalized at least 12 times, with her longest admission lasting 201 \nconsecutive days. She was also institutionalized in multiple residential \nplacements, one lasting for 322 consecutive days. \nd.  J.L.A. was hospitalized at least three times, with his longest lasting 265 days. He \nis currently institutionalized. \ne.  A.C. was repeatedly hospitalized, with her longest admission lasting 400 \nconsecutive days. She is currently institutionalized. \nf.  J.S.A. was hospitalized six times in two years, for a total of 462 days. He was also \ninstitutionalized in multiple residential placements and remains so currently. \ng.   J.L.A., J.S.A. and L.A. have experienced readmission to the hospital within one \nmonth of the previous discharge. \nh.  DCYF referred E.L., T.C., E.M., and D.R.V. to St. Maryโs, presumably because \neach required a higher level of care. However, St. Maryโs provided only a \nminimal amount of behavioral health services each week. Notably, E.M. did not \nreceive services designed to address her sole diagnosis (Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder). These children could have received more frequent and intensive \nservices in the community than they did at St. Maryโs. \nIV.  ENSURING ACCESS TO INTENSIVE COMMUNITY-BASED \nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL \nALTERATION TO RHODE ISLANDโS MEDICAID PROGRAM. \n \n248.  The DOJ recommended that Rhode Island ensure these critical services are โaccessible and \navailable in sufficient quantity and intensity to prevent unnecessarily lengthy and repeated \nhospitalizations at Bradley.โ It also called for improved discharge planning โto facilitate \nprompt discharge to the most integrated setting appropriate.โ \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 63 of 68 PageID #:\n63\n \n \n249.  The DOJ further found that ensuring access to Intensive Home and Community-Based \nServices would not โfundamentally alterโ Rhode Islandโs Medicaid program, as the need \nfor community-based services can be reasonably accommodated. It emphasized that states \nโmay be required to provide reasonable modificationsโsuch as expanding community-\nbased servicesโeven if that requires the state to increase the financial resources it devotes \nto these services.โ \n250.  The DOJ pointed out that expanding these existing services โis a reasonable modification,โ \nespecially since it aligns with Rhode Islandโs โplans and obligations.โ Defendants \nrecognize the โlimited existing capacityโ for community-based behavioral health services \nand โexpressed an intention to expand existing programs.โ EOHHS agreed that while its \nsystem of care would โhave an array of residential services,โ the use of those services \nโshould decrease over time as data shows that systems of care result in savings by reducing \ninappropriate use of inpatient services, residential treatment, and out-of-home placements \nacross child-serving systems, even as they increase the use of home and community-based \nservices, supports, and intensive care management.โ EOHHS indicated that its โprimary [] \nstrategyโ for its childrenโs behavioral health system of care was โfocus on prevention, \nmobile crisis, and care coordinationโ rather than โspending money on more expensive \nhospitalizations, Emergency Department (ED) visits, and other more restrictive care.โ  \n251.  Further, shifting Defendantsโ financial resources would not fundamentally alter Rhode \nIslandโs Medicaid program. As the DOJ pointed out, โshifting spending toward \ncommunity-based services is both reasonable and more cost-effective,โ as reducing reliance \non expensive, restrictive settings could โsave the State millions of dollars every year, which \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-00471-MRD-LDA     Document 1     Filed 11/13/24     Page 64 of 68 PageID #:\n64\n \n \ncould be reinvested back into building out increased community-based options and \nservicesโ for children and youth. \n252.  Defendants know that Intensive Home and Community-Based Services cost a fraction of \nwhat it costs to serve children in congregate care settings. For example, in FY 2021 alone, \nRhode Island spent over $13.6 million in Medicaid dollars on psychiatric hospitalizations \nand nearly $27 million on residential treatment facilities for children in DCYF care. In \ncontrast, according to both the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, states that invested in \ncommunity-based services rather than psychiatric residential treatment facilities realized \nโan average savings of $40,000 per year per child.โ Yet instead of investing in Intensive \nHome and Community-Based Services that would help prevent institutional placements, \nDefendants allocated $45 million to construct a new 16-bed residential treatment facility \nfor girls. \n253.  Although Defendants acknowledge that โ[t]he first step of complying with Olmstead is \ndeveloping a plan that works for moving people out of restrictive settings into the \ncommunity,โ stating that โwe strive to design a plan that also prevents unnecessary \ninstitutionalization in the first place,โ Defendants still lack an Olmstead Plan. While \nEOHHS is in the process of developing an Olmstead Plan, it will not be presented to the \nGovernorโs Office until at least February 2025. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I โ THE MEDICAID ACT \n254.
