(“Plaintiffs”), by and through their attorneys, Bailey Glasser LLP, \nDiCello Levitt LLP, Levy Konigsberg LLP, and Anapol Weis, bring this action against the County \nof Cook County, Illinois. Based upon the best information and belief, Plaintiffs allege the \nfollowing: \nNATURE OF THE CLAIM \n1.  For decades, employees, agents, and servants of the County of Cook County \n(“Defendant” or “Cook County”) and the State of Illinois vis a vis the Office of the Chief Judge \nof the Circuit Court of Cook County (“State”) sexually abused Plaintiffs and/or knowingly, \n  1\n\nintentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently allowed or failed to prevent sexual \nabuse of Plaintiffs while Plaintiffs were children in the legal and physical custody of Cook County \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 and/or the State of Illinois and confined at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    (formerly known as the Arthur J. Audy Home and hereinafter referred to as “JTDC”).  \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 2.  As a result of chronic mismanagement, patronage, overcrowding, and inadequate \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ supervision, JTDC has been an environment of violence, fear, and sexual abuse for decades.  \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 3.  Cook County has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to \nFI\nensure such protection. It furthermore employed individuals it knew or should have known would \nsexually abuse juveniles in its care and custody. \n4.  In 1999, a federal class action lawsuit was filed against Cook County, citing staff-\non-youth physical abuse, filthy conditions, understaffing, lack of medical care, overcrowding, and \nexcessive use of room confinement.  \n5.  While JTDC was originally designed to house no more than 500 youth, it regularly \nhoused 600 and as many as 800 youths at one time, resulting in youth incarceration in “overflow” \nareas such as dayrooms with other youths. \n6.  The class-action lawsuit resulted in a settlement that required Cook County to \nimprove conditions at the facility. Years later, in August 2007, the federal court presiding over the \nclass action determined that Cook County was not complying with the terms of the settlement \nagreement and appointed a “Transitional Administrator” (“TA”) to oversee the transition of \noperations from Cook County to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County \n(“OCJ”) in anticipation of legislation mandating as much, and to bring JTDC into compliance with \nthe settlement agreement.  \n  2\n\n7.  To that end, in 2007, the State of Illinois passed Public Act 095-0194, House Bill \n236, stripping the Cook County Board of its statutory authority to administer and operate JTDC \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 and transferring the administrative, budgetary, and operational control of JTDC to the Chief Judge \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    of the Circuit Court of Cook County, an arm of the State of Illinois  \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 8.  The  State  of  Illinois  enacted  this  legislation  as  a  result  of  mismanagement, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ patronage, and years of inhumane conditions at JTDC under Cook County’s authority.  \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 9.  The law went into effect on January 1, 2008 and mandated that the OCJ appoint a \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL new administrator to serve as superintendent of JTDC within 180 days. In mid-2008, the TA \nFI\nreported that JTDC was understaffed and needed more than 175 additional employees immediately \nin order to improve detainees’ care.  \n10.  Despite knowing that Cook County was failing to improve conditions and that \nJTDC needed an urgent influx of 175 additional employees to improve detainees’ care, and despite \nthe Chief Judge’s lawful duty to appoint a new superintendent of JTDC, the Chief Judge neglected \nto so much as convene a search committee for the new head of JTDC until 2013 and failed to issue \nan appointment until 2015. \n11.  The TA worked in close contact and collaboration with the OCJ until May 20, 2015, \nat which time the Chief Judge’s appointment of a new superintendent, an agent of the State of \nIllinois by and through the OCJ, was formalized. During this interim period, the OCJ and/or Cook \nCounty exercised control and retained the right to control the facility in whole or in part.  \n12.  In 2022, a committee convened by the OCJ reported that JTDC is “isolating and \ndeprivational” rather than rehabilitative. Most youths at JTDC spent at least 13 hours per day \nlocked in small cells from, at minimum, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Many youths spent several more hours \n  3\n\nlocked in their room on top of these 13 hours per day as a result of JTDC staff’s misuse of room \nconfinement as a form of discipline.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 13.  The committee stated that “Semantics do not diminish the harsh reality that JTDC \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    youth are locked in their cells for most of the day, every day…. No parent would be allowed to do \nA\n6 \n2\n9: this to their child.” Moreover, the committee concluded that “JTDC does not meet its affirmative \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ duty to rehabilitate youth and help high-risk youth heal through trauma-informed, developmentally \n2\n9/\nE: \nT appropriate care,” and that “[t]he JTDC physical structure is inappropriate and should be replaced \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL with smaller, community-based facilities that have specialized programs.” \nFI\n14.  Cook  County  implemented  systematic  and  unconstitutional  strip  searches  of \njuvenile inmates at JTDC during intake and throughout juveniles’ detention, which was a moving \nforce of certain willful and wanton acts of sexual abuse perpetrated upon Plaintiffs. In addition to \nviolating the Constitution of the United States, these pervasive patterns and practices within JTDC \nprovided the opportunity for the sexual penetration and fondling of minors. While this conduct is \ncriminal and unconstitutional, it is also violative of the administrative regulations governing the \nIllinois Department of Juvenile Justice, which requires that strip searches be performed by \nmembers of the same sex outside the view of others, that they shall be performed only when there \nis a reasonable suspicion to believe that the youth is carrying contraband in the area searched, and \nthat they shall be performed by medically trained persons under sanitary conditions. 20 Ill. Adm. \nCode 2602.50(f)(1-4). Notwithstanding these written administrative regulations, the State of \nIllinois and Cook County perpetrated a policy and practice of strip-searching juveniles in an \nunlawful manner that caused the willful, wanton, and widespread sexual abuse of juveniles in its \ncustody.  \n  4\n\n15.  A 2023 Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice Inspection Report confirmed that \nthis official practice and policy of unlawful strip-searches at intake continued until as recently as \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 2023. In addition to being violative of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Illinois, violative of governing administrative rules and regulations, it was also wholly ineffective \nA\n6 \n2\n9: in seizing contraband. In fact, between October 1, 2022 and April 30, 2022, JTDC conducted at \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ least 1,203 strip searches and not a single search resulted in finding contraband. In fact, between \n2\n9/\nE: \nT June 1, 2022 and April 30, 2022, contraband was only found a total of four times, but only through \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL use of the less-invasive wand or pat-down search on all four occasions.  \nFI\n16.  The  Illinois  Department  of  Juvenile  Justice  also  reported  that  JTDC  staff \nimplemented excessive room confinement of youth and left youth grievances unaddressed in some \ninstances.  \n17.  After passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”) in 2003, the State of \nIllinois and Cook County routinely and knowingly failed to implement and ensure compliance \nwith the prophylactic protections and requirements of the PREA, which was designed to eliminate \nsexual abuse of inmates.  \n18.  This action is brought pursuant to common law and the Childhood Sexual Abuse \nAct as codified at 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2, and its basis is in tort.  \n19.  This action alleges physical, psychological, and emotional injuries suffered as the \nresult of conduct constituting childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse as defined in Illinois \nCompiled Statute 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and negligence. \nJURISDICTION \n20.  Plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois and the venue of the Circuit \nCourt of Cook County pursuant to Section 5/2-103 and 5/2-209 of the Illinois Code of Civil \n  5\n\nProcedure as the principal office of Cook County, a public or governmental corporation, is located \nin Cook County and because the tortious acts giving rise to this action occurred in Cook County.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 21.  The Law Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County has jurisdiction over this \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    action in that each Plaintiff seeks recovery of monetary damages in excess of $100,000.00 for \nA\n6 \n2\n9: personal injuries under the Childhood Sexual Abuse Act as codified at 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ PARTIES \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 22.  Plaintiffs are adults who were resident adolescent citizens of the State of Illinois at \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL the time of the acts described herein and were born on or after July 24, 1983. Plaintiffs bring this \nFI\naction using pseudonyms to shield their identities because they are particularly vulnerable parties \nas victims of sexual abuse. See Doe v. Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 19 N.E.3d 178, 191 (Ill. \nApp. Ct. 2014). Moreover, Plaintiffs’ sexual abuse occurred while incarcerated at the Cook County \nJuvenile Temporary Detention Center, which pursuant to 55 ILCS 75/2 must meet the minimum \nstandards established by the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. 705 ILCS 405/1-8, et seq., \nprotects the identity of all juvenile individuals in the juvenile court system, and all such court \ndocuments “are sealed and may never be disclosed to the general public or otherwise made widely \navailable.” 705 ILCS 405/1-8(a). Moreover, revealing Plaintiffs’ identities as victims of childhood \nsexual  abuse  would  subject  Plaintiffs  and  their  families  to  compounded  humiliation, \nembarrassment, and emotional distress. Accordingly, filed concurrently herewith is a request for \nPlaintiffs to proceed using fictitious names pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-401(e) and to file this initial \npleading without identifying information except as otherwise provided herein. \n23.  Plaintiffs join their claims in this action pursuant to the Illinois Code of Civil \nProcedure 735 ILCS 5 et seq. as Plaintiffs’ right to relief arises out of the same transaction or series \n  6\n\nof transactions, and this action raises common questions of law or fact among all Plaintiffs against \nthe County of Cook County, Illinois. \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 24.

Pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/5-1001, the Defendant is the County of Cook County \n2\n9/\nE: \nT (hereinafter “Defendant,” “Cook County,” or “County”), a body politic and corporate which has \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL been established in the State of Illinois. By and through the Cook County Board of County \nFI\nCommissioners and or the Cook County Board, the County confined minors, including all \nPlaintiffs herein, at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (“JTDC”).

When Plaintiff D.D. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff member named \nMr. House, while acting in the course and scope of employment and under the control of Cook \nCounty, sexually abused D.D. in 2004. \n  11 \n\n82.  House was at all relevant times a short, slightly heavy-set black male estimated to \nbe in his 30s. He had long hair and wore glasses. D.D. expects to learn the full name and identity \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    83.  Mr. House has been accused of sexually abusing multiple victims at JTDC who \nA\n6 \n2\n9: have filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County. \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 84.  On the second floor of JTDC, D.D. along with other youths lived in lock-down for \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 23 hours a day with only one hour outside of their respective cells. Approximately two to four \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL weeks into D.D.’s stay at JTDC, House approached D.D. and offered to move him up a level on \nFI\nthe facility's behavioral chart to give him extra recreational and day room time, in exchange for \nsexual favors. Under this coercion, House masturbated D.D. and administered oral copulation on \nhim inside of his cell. House sexually abused D.D. in this manner approximately two to four times \na week over the course of four to six weeks. During this period, D.D. spoke to other youths on his \nhousing unit about House's sexually abusive behavior, and several other youths said that they were \nalso being sexually abused by House in the same manner. House threatened to revoke D.D.’s \nprivileges and keep him locked inside of his cell for the rest of his stay if he ever resisted or \nreported the abuse. He gave D.D. extra time outside of his cell and extra food as incentive to \ncontinue suffering the abuse and as a reward for enduring the abuse. \n85.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  12 \n\n86.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff D.D. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    87.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n6 \n2\n9: that this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \n2\n9/\nE: \nT various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \nFI\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n88.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.D., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n89.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of D.H. \n90.  When Plaintiff D.H. was between the ages of 13 and 15 and housed at JTDC, a staff \nmember  named  Mr.  House  and  another  staff  member  (hereinafter  “D.H.

House was at all relevant times a short black male estimated to be in his 30s or 40s. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    He wore his hair in dreadlocks. \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 92.  D.H. Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a black male estimated to be in his 30s or \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 40s and approximately 6’1 in height. He had curly hair. \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 93.  D.H. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL of discovery. \nFI\n94.  Over the course of D.H.’s three or four stays at JTDC, House regularly brought \nD.H. into the bathroom, forcibly undressed him, groped and fondled his genitals, and digitally \npenetrated him. On some occasions House was joined by D.H. Abuser 2, who participated in \ngroping and digitally penetrating D.H. When D.H. attempted to resist the abuse, House told him \n“this is my fucking house, you do what I ask you to do or else,” then choked and punched D.H., \nhit him with a broom, and/or squeezed his testicles hard enough to cause severe pain. House also \nregularly entered the bathroom while D.H. showered to grab and fondle his genitals and buttocks. \nHouse sexually abused D.H. in this manner on a near-daily basis over the course of several months-\nlong stays. D.H. Abuser 2 accompanied House in sexually abusing D.H. on a weekly basis. On \nsome occasions House gave D.H. cigarettes and marijuana as a reward for enduring the abuse. \n95.  During this period of abuse, D.H.’s mother and grandmother visited D.H. at JTDC. \nD.H. told them about House’s sexually abusive behavior, and they urged him to report House to \nother staff members. D.H. also spoke with other youths who said they were also being sexually \nabused by House. Together, D.H. and several other youths filed grievances against House, and \nD.H. verbally reported the abuse to a “white shirt” authority figure. The white shirt said that D.H. \n  14 \n\nwas lying about House and dismissed his report, and no one followed up with D.H. or the other \nyouths about their grievances. \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 96.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nA\n6 \n2\n9: and Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 97.

Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nabuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n99.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.H., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n100.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \n  15 \n\nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Sexual Abuse of D.D. 2 \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 101.

Mr. Martin has been accused of sexually abusing multiple victims at JTDC who \nhave filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County. \n104.  Starting within the first few days of D.D. 2’s stay at JTDC, Mr. Martin gained D.D. \n2’s trust by making friendly conversation with him and comforting him during evening lock-up. \nAfter a few days of this behavior, Mr. Martin entered D.D. 2’s cell late at night and said that he \nwould physically harm D.D. 2 and his family unless he provided him with sexual favors. Under \nthese threats, Mr. Martin coerced D.D. 2 into performing oral copulation on him and having sexual \nintercourse with him inside of his cell. Mr. Martin sexually abused D.D. 2 approximately seven to \nnine times across multiple stays at JTDC. He gave D.D. 2 extra food and extra time outside of his \ncell as a reward for keeping quiet about the abuse and incentive to continue to suffer the abuse. \n105.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \n  16 \n\nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 106.

J.A. expects to learn the full name \n2\n9/\nE: \nT and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 112.  After evening lock-up in mid-January of 2000, J.A. banged on his cell door and \nFI\nasked to be taken to the medical unit. Scott approached J.A. and told him to be quiet, so J.A. \nstopped and went to bed. A short time later, Scott returned to J.A. and asked him if he wanted to \ngo home.

When Plaintiff M.G. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members \n(hereinafter “M.G. Abuser 1” and “M.G. Abuser 2,” collectively “M.G. Abusers” unless otherwise \nindicated), while acting in the course and scope of their employment and under the control of Cook \nCounty, sexually abused M.G. in 1998. \n137.  M.G. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a short, heavy-set black male estimated to \nbe in his 30s. He had a low fade haircut. \n138.  M.G. Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a bald, stocky black male estimated to be \nin his 30s and approximately 5’11 in height. \n139.  M.G. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n140.  A few weeks into M.G.’s stay at JTDC, M.G. Abusers approached M.G. in his cell \nand told him to follow them under the guise of a doctor’s appointment. M.G., who had not \nrequested a doctor's appointment but feared getting in trouble with the staff members, did as he \nwas told and followed M.G. Abusers into an isolated room within his housing unit. Once there, \nM.G. Abuser 1 told M.G. to pull down his pants, and M.G. complied under the impression that the \n  23 \n\ndoctor would enter shortly. M.G. Abuser 1 then grabbed and fondled M.G.'s bare genitals while \nM.G. Abuser 2 watched. M.G. asked what he was doing, and M.G. Abuser 1 responded “don't you \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 want to go home? You can go home after this” then attempted to put his mouth on M.G.’s genitals. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    M.G. pulled away from him, but M.G. Abuser 1 continued to fondle M.G.’s genitals for another \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 30 to 60 seconds. M.G. Abusers then escorted M.G. back to his cell and said “someone else is \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ gonna come see you later.”  \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 141.  That evening, M.G. reported M.G. Abusers’ sexually abusive behavior to a male \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL “white shirt” authority figure, but he told M.G. to be quiet and go back into his cell. The next day, \nFI\nM.G. was placed on parole and released from JTDC. He immediately reported the incident with \nM.G. Abusers to his mother, and she called JTDC multiple times in an attempt to further report \nthe sexual abuse. No one at JTDC followed up with M.G. or his mother regarding their reports. \n142.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff M.G., staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n6 \n2\n9: belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \n2\n9/\nE: \nT arising therefrom.  \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 146.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of R.G.  \n147.

R.G. expects to learn the full \nname and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n149.  Starting within the first few days of his stay at JTDC, R.G. Abuser 1 regularly \nstopped  by  R.G.’s  cell  after  evening  lock-up  to  give  him  extra  snacks  and  make  friendly \nconversation. After a few days of this behavior, R.G. Abuser 1 started to grope R.G.’s genitals \nover his boxers while making sexual comments. After a few more days, R.G. Abuser 1 offered \n  25 \n\nR.G. outside food and extra privileges in exchange for sexual favors. R.G. capitulated to this \ncoercion, and R.G. Abuser 1 administered oral sex on him, coerced him into administering oral \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 sex on her, and had sexual intercourse with him. R.G. Abuser 1 sexually abused R.G. in this \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    manner five to ten times in all. R.G. Abuser 1 told R.G. that he was “old enough to know what \nA\n6 \n2\n9: needs to happen here” and said that he would lose his privileges and never see his parents again if \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ anyone ever learned of the abuse. She said that he shouldn’t even bother telling anyone because \n2\n9/\nE: \nT “they'll believe me over you” and he'll be the one who gets in trouble. She gave him outside food \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL and soda as a reward for enduring the abuse. \nFI\n150.  Shortly after R.G. was released from JTDC, his mother received a call from JTDC \nstaff who said that R.G. had tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease (“STD”) during his \nroutine release physical.

At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff R.G. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n153.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \n  26 \n\nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \nwarn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    and to protect the Plaintiff.  \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 154.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff R.G., staff members \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n2\n9/\nE: \nT belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \nFI\narising therefrom.  \n155.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of D.S.  \n156.  When Plaintiff D.S. was 16 and 17 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff \nmembers (hereinafter “D.S. Abuser 1” and “D.S. Abuser 2” unless otherwise indicated), while \nacting in the course and scope of their employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually \nabused D.S. in 2009. \n157.  D.S. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a black female of medium build and \napproximately 5’8 or 5’9 in height. She had short hair. \n158.  Within the first few weeks of D.S.’s stay at JTDC, D.S.

Throughout the rest of his stay at JTDC, \nD.S. Abuser 1 regularly groped his genitals over the clothes and made sexual comments about his \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 body, genitals, and her perceptions of his sexual prowess. She often described in explicit detail \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    how she wished to perform sexual acts with D.S. once he was released. She frequently gave him \nA\n6 \n2\n9: extra food, extra time outside of her cell, and extra phone time as a reward for enduring the abuse, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ and often threatened to revoke all his privileges and extend his sentence if he ever reported her \n2\n9/\nE: \nT sexually abusive behavior. \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 159.  D.S. Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a tall black female of medium build and of \nFI\nmedium complexion. \n160.  On D.S.’s 17th birthday, staff members put him inside an empty cell while they \nprepared his transport to the Cook County Jail. While inside this cell, D.S. Abuser 2 entered and \noffered to give him a “birthday gift” before he left the facility. She brought D.S. to a nearby \nbathroom where she masturbated him and coerced him into giving her oral sex. D.S. was \ntransferred out of JTDC a few hours later and did not see D.S. Abuser 2 again. \n161.  D.S. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n162.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n163.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.S., staff members \nFI\nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n166.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of E.B.  \n167.

E.B. regularly played checkers with the other juvenile inmates on his housing unit. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    A few weeks into his stay at JTDC, Jones approached E.B. and gained E.B.'s trust by playing \nA\n6 \n2\n9: checkers with him after evening lock-up. Jones rewarded E.B. with gifts such as pizza, extra time \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ outside of his cell, and a radio when he beat Jones at checkers. After a few weeks of this behavior, \n2\n9/\nE: \nT Jones approached E.B. when he was in the bathroom by himself and offered him a PlayStation or \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL Xbox in exchange for sexual favors. Jones said that he had this “arrangement” with several other \nFI\nyouths, and that he rewarded his victims handsomely for enduring the sexual abuse. E.B. refused, \nso Jones forcibly grabbed E.B.’s genitals and began to masturbate him. E.B. pushed his hand away \nand ran away from the bathroom. Jones revoked the gifts and privileges he had previously granted \nE.B. as a punishment for refusing his advances.  \n170.  After this incident, Jones regularly groped and fondled E.B.’s buttocks and genitals \nin passing throughout the facility, such as in line the cafeteria and in the hallways of the housing \nunit.

The staff member said \nhe would try to get E.B. moved off of his housing unit, but neither he nor anyone else at JTDC \nfollowed up with E.B. regarding his report.  \n171.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  30 \n\n172.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff C.K., staff members \nFI\nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n186.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of G.D.  \n187.

Mr. Dent was at all relevant times a bald, dark-skinned black male of muscular \nbuild estimated to be in his late 30s to early 40s and approximately 5’6 to 5’7 in height. G.D. \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 expects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    189.  During evening lock-up, G.D. and a few other youths banged on their cell doors to \nA\n6 \n2\n9: express their frustration with the conditions of JTDC. Mr. Dent entered G.D.’s cell, grabbed him \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ by the neck, forcefully pushed him backwards onto his bed, and told him to “be quiet before I hit \n2\n9/\nE: \nT you in the nuts.” Mr. Dent then grabbed and squeezed G.D.’s genitals over the clothes, hard enough \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL to cause severe pain, then exited G.D.’s cell and slammed his door closed. \nFI\n190.  The next morning, G.D. verbally reported Mr. Dent’s sexually abusive behavior to \na “white shirt” authority figure named Mr. Lopez. Mr. Lopez told G.D. that he would look into the \nincident and get back to him, but he nor anyone else at JTDC followed up with G.D. regarding his \nreport. G.D. also spoke to his friend and fellow inmate (whose name G.D. recalls but intentionally \nwithholds at this time) about Mr. Dent, and his fellow inmate said that Mr. Dent was also sexually \nabusing him. This fellow inmate later died in JTDC custody in 2012. \n191.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff G.D., staff members \n2\n9/\nE: \nT were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nFI\nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n195.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of T.M.  \n196.

Abuser 1 asked \nA\n6 \n2\n9: T.M. if he wanted to take another shower “just with you and me.” T.M. refused, so T.M. Abuser \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 1 sent him to confinement inside of his cell as punishment. T.M. Abuser 1 sexually abused T.M. \n2\n9/\nE: \nT in this manner approximately two to three times a week for one to two months. \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 199.  T.M. Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a tall, dark-skinned black male estimated \nFI\nto be in his early 30s. He had dreadlocks and worked on unit 4K.  \n200.  T.M. expects to learn the full identity of his abusers during the course of discovery.  \n201.  Starting within the first few weeks of T.M.’s second stay at JTDC in late 2003, \nT.M. Abuser 2 regularly watched T.M. while he showered and made sexual comments about his \nbody. During and after the showers, T.M. Abuser 2 regularly groped T.M.'s genitals and smacked \nhim on the buttocks. On some occasions, T.M. Abuser 2 visited T.M.’s cell during evening lock-\nup to grope his genitals and buttocks while making sexual comments. When T.M. attempted to \nresist the abuse, T.M. Abuser 2 told him to “shut the fuck up” and threatened to send him to \nconfinement. T.M. Abuser 2 sexually abused T.M. in this manner approximately two to three times \na week for approximately one month. \n202.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  36 \n\n203.

Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n6 \n2\n9: that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n2\n9/\nE: \nT breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nFI\nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n205.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.M., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n206.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of A.W.  \n  37 \n\n207.  When Plaintiff A.W. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members \nnamed Ms. Williams and Mr. Coleman, while acting in the course and scope of their employment \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused A.W. in 2001. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    208.  Ms. Williams was at all relevant times a tall, heavy-set black female estimated to \nA\n6 \n2\n9: be in her 40s. She wore glasses, often had her hair in braids, and regularly smoked cigarettes. \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 209.  Starting within the first few days of A.W.’s stay at JTDC, Ms. Williams gained \n2\n9/\nE: \nT A.W.’s  trust  by  bringing  him  extra  food  and  asking  him  about  his  personal  life.  After \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL approximately two weeks of this behavior, Ms. Williams entered A.W.’s cell a few hours after \nFI\nevening lock-up and threatened to extend his stay at JTDC and keep him locked inside his cell for \nthe rest of his stay unless he gave her sexual favors. Ms. Williams coerced A.W. into kissing her \nneck and breasts, digitally penetrating her, and masturbating himself while she watched. Ms. \nWilliams sexually abused A.W. in this manner approximately four times a week over the course \nof seven to eight months. She sexually abused A.W. late at night after lock-up and in the mornings \nbefore the end of her shift. She often told A.W. that she would make his life “a living hell” if he \never reported the abuse. She gave him cigarettes and extra food as a reward for keeping quiet about \nthe abuse. \n210.  Mr. Coleman was at all relevant times a muscular black male estimated to be in his \nlate 50s and of average height. He was regularly and noticeably drunk during his shifts. \n211.  Starting soon after Ms. Williams began abusing A.W., Mr. Coleman entered A.W.’s \ncell in the evening after lock-up, punched him in the chest, and kicked him repeatedly as he lay on \nthe ground. Mr. Coleman then forced A.W. to stand up, pulled A.W.’s pants down, and threatened \nhim with more physical harm unless he provided him with sexual favors. Mr. Coleman physically \nintimidated A.W. into masturbating himself while Mr. Coleman watched and made demeaning \n  38 \n\nsexual comments. Mr. Coleman sexually abused A.W. in this manner approximately two to three \ntimes a week over the course of seven to eight months. He regularly slapped, punched, and kicked \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 A.W. and threatened to hurt him even more if he ever reported the abuse. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    212.  A.W. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nA\n6 \n2\n9: of discovery. \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 213.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \n2\n9/\nE: \nT were non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL and Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \nFI\n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n214.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff A.W. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n215.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nabuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n216.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff A.W., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n  39 \n\nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 217.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nA\n6 \n2\n9: Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n2\n9/\nE: \nT employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL Sexual Abuse of D.B.  \nFI\n218.  When Plaintiff D.B. was approximately 13 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff \nmember (hereinafter “D.B. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and \nscope of his employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused D.B. in \napproximately 2001. \n219.  D.B. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a slightly heavy-set black male estimated \nto be in his 40s and approximately 5’10 to 6’0 in height. He was going bald and occasionally wore \nglasses. D.B. expects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of \ndiscovery. \n220.  During D.B.’s intake process, D.B. Abuser 1 ordered D.B. to undress and fondled \nhis genitals for several minutes while making sexual comments. He did not wear gloves during \nthis incident.  \n221.  A few days later in the mid-day, D.B. Abuser 1 approached D.B. in his cell and \noffered him advice about his upcoming court date. He then said that he had to strip search D.B. \nand ordered him to undress. D.B., though confused as to why he was being strip searched, did as \nhe was told and undressed. D.B. Abuser 1 then masturbated D.B.’s genitals and digitally penetrated \n  40 \n\nhim under the guise of a strip search. He did not wear gloves during this incident. Once D.B. \nAbuser 1 finished the “strip search,” he forcefully pinned D.B. against the wall of the cell and \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 forcibly administered oral copulation on him. D.B. attempted to resist the abuse, but D.B. Abuser \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1 was much bigger and able to physically restrain D.B. during the incident of abuse. D.B. Abuser \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 1 sexually abused D.B. in this manner one more time after this incident. D.B. was released from \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ JTDC one to two weeks after the abuse started and did not see D.B. Abuser 1 again. \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 222.  This “strip search” was conducted upon D.B. without individualized, reasonable \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL suspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions of the United States and the State of Illinois, nor \nFI\nthe administrative rules governing strip searches. This search was nothing more than a pretext for \nsexual abuse. \n223.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n224.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff D.B. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n225.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \nwarn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n  41 \n\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 226.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.B., staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n6 \n2\n9: belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \n2\n9/\nE: \nT arising therefrom.  \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 227.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of V.H.  \n228.  When Plaintiff V.H. was approximately 15 years old and housed at JTDC, an intake \nstaff member (hereinafter “V.H. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course \nand scope of her employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused V.H. in \n2005. \n229.  V.H. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a slightly heavy-set black female estimated \nto be in her late 30s to early 40s and of average height.

Abuser 1 and another female staff member \nbrought her into the intake room and ordered her to undress and give them her undergarments. \nV.H. did as she was told, and V.H. Abuser 1 inspected her bra and underwear closely. Once \n  42 \n\nfinished, she ordered V.H. to squat and cough, then groped and fondled V.H.’s breasts for \napproximately 20 to 30 seconds. V.H., who was very flat-chested at the time, was uncomfortable \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 with V.H. Abuser 1’s fondling but feared getting in trouble if she spoke up. V.H. Abuser 1 ordered \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    V.H. to squat and cough again, then rubbed her ungloved hand against V.H.’s bare genitals for \nA\n6 \n2\n9: approximately ten seconds. V.H. left the next day and did not see V.H. Abuser 1 again. \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 231.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff V.H., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n  43 \n\nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 235.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nA\n6 \n2\n9: Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n2\n9/\nE: \nT employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL Sexual Abuse of A.B. \nFI\n236.

A.B. \nexpects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n238.  On at least five occasions, A.B. Abuser 1 sexually abused A.B. in A.B.’s cell. A.B. \nAbuser 1 would begin sexually abusing A.B. by hugging and kissing him.  A.B. Abuser 1 would \nthen masturbate A.B.’s penis. A.B. Abuser 1 would show photographs of her vagina to A.B., and \nshe would lift her shirt to expose her bare breasts to A.B.   \n239.  On at least one occasion, A.B.

D.C. never \nattempted to smuggle contraband into the facility and had very few disciplinary infractions against \nhim during his stay at JTDC, but he did not resist this abuse out of fear of getting in more trouble. \nMr. G sexually abused D.C. in this manner approximately three to four times over the course of \nthree months. After each search, D.C. attempted to verbally report Mr. G’s sexually abusive \nbehavior to other staff members, and each time D.C. was told to “forget about it” and to stop trying \nto report the incidents. \n302.  These “searches” were conducted upon D.C. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions of the United States and the State of Illinois, nor \nthe administrative rules governing strip searches.

Within the first few days of C.L.’s stay at JTDC, Brown told C.L. that he had to \n2\n9/\nE: \nT search him every time he left the housing unit. C.L. was hesitant as no other youths had to be \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL searched in this manner, and none of the other staff members tried to search C.L., but he feared \nFI\nthat resistance would constitute a violation of facility rules. Brown then forcefully pushed C.L. \nagainst the wall and patted him down over the clothes, during which time he grabbed, groped, and \nfondled C.L.’s genitals.

P.M. expects to learn the full name \nand identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n380.  Starting during one of P.M.’s first stays at JTDC in 2002, Walker regularly brought \nP.M. into the bathroom and ordered him to undress under the guise of a strip search. During these \n“strip searches,” Mr. Walker grabbed and groped P.M.’s bare genitals.  \n  72 \n\n381.  These “searches” were conducted upon P.M. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions of the United States and the State of Illinois, nor \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 the administrative rules governing strip searches. These searches were nothing more than a pretext \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    for sexual abuse. \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 382.  After a few weeks of these strip searches, Walker approached P.M. in his cell, gave \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ him outside food, and asked him to come into the bathroom so they could talk in private. P.M. \n2\n9/\nE: \nT initially refused and said they could talk inside of his cell, but Walker insisted that he wanted to \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL talk to P.M. away from the cameras. P.M. capitulated and Walker lured him into the bathrooms, \nFI\nwhere he ordered P.M. to undress and threatened to revoke P.M.’s privileges by moving him down \na behavioral level unless he gave him sexual favors. Under this threat, Walker masturbated P.M. \ninside of the bathroom. After this incident, Walker sexually abused P.M. in this manner two to five \ntimes a week over the course of P.M.’s several stays at JTDC, collectively about one year. On \nsome occasions, Walker asked P.M. to masturbate him but P.M. refused, so Walker placed P.M. \non confinement and revoked his privileges as punishment. He gave P.M. outside food and \ncigarettes. \n383.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n384.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff P.M., staff members \nFI\nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n387.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of M.B.  \n388.

He then grabbed M.B.’s genitals \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL over the clothes and pulled on them forcefully, hard enough to cause severe pain. He threatened \nFI\nM.B. with further sexual violence if he did not behave, then ordered him back to his cell. M.B. did \nnot have any significant interactions with Mr. Young after this incident.  \n392.  The next morning, M.B. verbally reported Mr. Young’s sexually abusive behavior \nto another staff member. This staff member dismissed his report and said that he was lying. No \none at JTDC followed up with M.B. regarding his report. \n393.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count.  \n564.  Cook County, as well as its employees, agents, and officers, were required by law \nto take or otherwise voluntarily took the custody of minors, including Plaintiffs herein, within its \n  108 \n\njurisdiction such as to deprive them of their normal opportunities for protection. The Plaintiffs and \nCook County, and its employees and agents stood in such a special relationship to one another that \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 the law imposes on the State an obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the Plaintiffs, \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    including but not limited to an affirmative duty to aid and/or protect against and prevent an \nA\n6 \n2\n9: unreasonable risk of physical harm from third parties, including its own agents or employees.  \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ 565.  As such, Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees, owed various duties \n2\n9/\nE: \nT to those juveniles, including Plaintiffs, in its custody. They include, but are not limited to: (1) a \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL duty to provide individualized assessments to rehabilitate and prevent further delinquent behavior \nFI\nthrough the development of educational, vocational, social, emotional and basic life skills which \nenable youth to grow and mature; (2) a duty to secure care and guidance as will serve the safety \nand moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the minor; (3) a duty to control the \nindividuals who are the source of the sexual abuse alleged herein; (4) a duty to provide the minor \nwith food, shelter, education, and medical care; (5) a duty to not permit an act of sexual abuse \nwhen the person has knowledge of sexual abuse; (6) a duty, when having reason to believe that \nsexual abuse has or will occur, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the sexual abuse by \nreporting the sexual abuse, or causing a report to be made, to medical or law enforcement \nauthorities and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services; (7) a duty to act as a \nreasonable, prudent State of Illinois employee, agent, or officer would act under the circumstances \nto ensure the prevention and reporting of sexual abuse; (8) a duty to provide confined youth with \nmultiple avenues to report sexual abuse, including an avenue outside the facility, so that even if \nthe abuser is someone directly supervising that inmate or higher up in the authority chain, or a staff \nperson or inmate who might retaliate against that inmate, the victim still has a safe way to report \nthe abuse, thus ensuring both increased reporting, deterrence, and prevention of abuse; (9) a duty \n  109 \n\nto provide confined youth with access to emotional support services from outside the facility to \nhelp confined youth heal from trauma; (10) a duty to protect them against an unreasonable risk of \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 physical and/or psychological harm, including sexual abuse; (11) a duty to protect children; (12) a \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    duty to rehabilitate youth through developing the competencies of the youth in its care, including \nA\n6 \n2\n9: but not limited to the enhancement and development of educational, vocational, social, emotional, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ and basic life skills; (13) a duty to actively participate in the continuity of care of the juvenile \n2\n9/\nE: \nT justice system; (14) a duty to actively engage in positive youth development; (15) a duty to secure \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL for each minor in its custody such care and guidance as will serve the safety and moral, emotional, \nFI\nmental, and physical welfare of the minor and the best interests of the community; and (16) a duty \nto preserve and strengthen the minor’s family ties whenever possible. \n566.  These duties are non-exhaustive and non-delegable. Given the special relationship \nof custodian and ward between Cook County and Plaintiffs herein, Cook County is directly liable \nand vicariously liable in whole or in part for the acts, omissions, and tortious conduct, whether \nnegligent and/or intentional, of its employees and agents.  \n567.  Sexual abuse of children at JTDC was persistent and prevalent, and the nature of \ntheir confinement and seclusion from family, as well as prior reports of abuse, rendered the risk of \nsexual abuse to be foreseeable and imminent. Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees \nknew or should have known that it had numerous agents, officers, and employees who sexually \nabused children at JTDC.  \n568.  Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees breached each of the foregoing \nduties, among others. \n569.  In so doing, Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees violated one or \nmore statutes or ordinances that provide for a punishment and caused the kind of harm the statutes \n  110 \n\nor ordinances were intended to prevent. The Plaintiffs were a member of the class the statutes or \nordinances were intended to protect.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 570.  Cook County failed to use ordinary care in determining whether JTDC was safe \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    and/or  determining  whether  it  had  sufficient  information  to  represent  their  facilities  and/or \nA\n6 \n2\n9: programs as safe. Cook County’s breach of various duties include, but are not limited to: failure \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ to protect Plaintiffs from a known/suspected danger, failure to supervise staff members and \n2\n9/\nE: \nT Plaintiffs, failure to implement minimally sufficient policies and procedures in place to prevent \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL sex abuse, failure to take reasonable measures to ensure that policies and procedures to prevent \nFI\nsex abuse were working, failure to adequately inform children of the risks of staff-on-resident sex \nabuse, failure to investigate and report risks of staff-on-resident sex abuse, failure to properly train \nthe staff at the facilities and/or programs, failure to train children about the dangers of sex abuse \nby facility staff, failure to have an outside agency test their safety procedures, failure to protect the \nchildren in its facilities and/or programs from sex abuse, failure to adhere to the applicable standard \nof care for resident safety, failure to control and prevent its employees, officers, and agents from \ncommitting sexual abuse. \n571.  Upon information and belief, Cook County, its employees, agents, and officers, \nadditionally violated their legal duty by failing to report and/or prevent known and/or suspected \nsexual abuse of children by Plaintiffs’ abusers and/or their other agents to law enforcement. \n572.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and officers created a foreseeable risk of \nharm to Plaintiffs. As vulnerable children placed and participating in the facilities and/or programs \nCook  County  offered  that  were  overseen  by  poorly  trained,  insufficiently  supervised,  and \ninadequately  vetted  officers  and  supervisory  staff,  Plaintiffs  were  foreseeable  victims. \nAdditionally, as vulnerable children whom Plaintiffs’ abusers had access to and full control of \n  111 \n\nthrough Cook County’s facilities and/or programs, Plaintiffs were foreseeable victims. Moreover, \nCook  County  implemented  an  unconstitutional  policy  of  strip-searching  children  without  a \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 particularized suspicion, which provided a false pretext for sexual abuse. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    573.  As a direct and proximate result of the above-described conduct, Plaintiffs have \nA\n6 \n2\n9: suffered, and will continue to suffer, great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ discomfort, physical manifestations of emotional distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, \n2\n9/\nE: \nT disgrace, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, and the loss of normal life. They were prevented, \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL and  will  continue  to  be  prevented,  from  performing  daily  activities  and  obtaining  the  full \nFI\nenjoyment of life.

Cook County was negligent in its retention of Plaintiffs’ abusers in that they knew, \nor should have known, through the exercise of ordinary care, that the conduct of Plaintiffs’ abusers \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 subjected third parties to an unreasonable risk of harm, including Plaintiffs’ abusers’ sexual abuse \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    of children in its charge.  \nA\n6 \n2\n9: 595.  In failing to timely remove Plaintiffs’ abusers from working with children or \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ terminate their employment, the Defendant failed to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably \n2\n9/\nE: \nT prudent person would have exercised under similar circumstances, which resulted in Plaintiffs’ \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL injuries alleged in this action.  \nFI\n596.  The  particular  unfitness  of  Plaintiffs’  abusers  and  Cook  County’s  various \nbreaches of duties owed to the Plaintiffs directly and proximately caused in whole or in part \nPlaintiffs to suffer great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, discomfort, physical \nmanifestations of emotional distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, disgrace, humiliation, \nloss of enjoyment of life, and the loss of normal life. They were prevented, and will continue to be \nprevented, from performing daily activities and obtaining the full enjoyment of life. They have \nsustained, and will continue to sustain, loss of earnings and earning capacity. They have incurred, \nand will continue to incur, expenses for medical and psychological treatment, therapy, and \ncounseling.  \nCOUNT VI – Negligent Supervision \n597.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count.  \n598.  At all relevant times herein, Cook County had a duty to supervise the Plaintiffs’ \nabusers so as to ensure that those minors in its custody would not be sexually abused. \n  116 \n\n599.  Cook County breached this duty of supervision and negligently supervised the \nPlaintiffs’ abusers.  \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 600.  Cook County knew or should have known that both its employees who sexually \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    abused Plaintiffs and its employees who negligently failed to prevent and/or report the sexual \nA\n6 \n2\n9: abuse behaved in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner, and Cook County, having this \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ knowledge, failed to supervise its employees adequately, or take other action to prevent the harm \n2\n9/\nE: \nT to Plaintiffs. \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL 601.  Cook County’s negligence proximately caused in whole or in part the Plaintiffs to \nFI\nsuffer great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, discomfort, physical manifestations \nof emotional distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, disgrace, humiliation, loss of enjoyment \nof life, and the loss of normal life. They were prevented, and will continue to be prevented, from \nperforming daily activities and obtaining the full enjoyment of life. They have sustained, and will \ncontinue to sustain, loss of earnings and earning capacity. They have incurred, and will continue \nto incur, expenses for medical and psychological treatment, therapy, and counseling. \nCOUNT VII – Negligent Training \n602.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count. \n603.  Cook County was at all times responsible for the safety of the children in its \ncustody. Cook County was at all relevant times responsible for creating and enforcing training that \nensured the safety of the children in its custody. This duty is non-delegable, and Cook County is \nvicariously liable for the actions and omissions of their employees and agents in failing to train the \nabusers of Plaintiffs.  \n  117 \n\n604.  Cook County knew or should have known its employees behaved or would behave \nin a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner, and having this knowledge, failed to supervise \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 the subject abusers adequately, or take other action to prevent the harm. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    605.  At all relevant times, Plaintiffs’ abusers were employees and/or agents of the \nA\n6 \n2\n9: Defendant. Plaintiffs’ abusers and the Defendant (or Defendant’s agents) were therefore in \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ employee–employer relationships. As employees and/or agents of the Defendant, Plaintiffs’ \n2\n9/\nE: \nT abusers were under the direct supervision, management, agency, and control of the Defendant \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL and/or its agent(s) at all relevant times during their interactions with Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ abusers \nFI\nengaged in the wrongful conduct complained of herein while acting in the course and scope of \ntheir employment with the Defendant (or Defendant’s agents) and/or perpetrated the sexual abuse \nby virtue of their job-created authority.  \n606.  At all relevant times, the Defendant had a duty, arising from their (or their agents’) \nemployment of Plaintiffs’ abusers, to ensure that Plaintiffs’ abusers did not sexually abuse children \nin its custody, including training and supervising them to ensure they did not sexually abuse \nchildren in custody. Further, at all relevant times, Defendant had a duty to investigate inappropriate \nbehavior on their part, and to discipline them appropriately, including by terminating their \naffiliations with the Defendant.  \n607.  The Defendant was negligent in its hiring, training, and supervision of Plaintiffs’ \nabusers in that they knew, or should have known, through the exercise of ordinary care, that the \nconduct of Plaintiffs’ abusers would subject Plaintiffs to an unreasonable risk of harm, including \nthe propensity of Plaintiffs’ abusers to sexually abuse children in its charge.  \n  118 \n\n608.  Cook County gave Plaintiffs’ abusers regular, direct, unsupervised, ongoing access \nto Plaintiffs and other residents during the course and scope of their duties, when the State knew \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 or should have known that they presented an unreasonable risk of harm to children.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    609.  Additionally, the Defendant owed a duty to train and educate employees and \nA\n6 \n2\n9: administrators and establish adequate and effective policies and procedures calculated to detect, \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ prevent, and address sexual abuse of children by JTDC facility staff.  \n2\n9/\nE: \nT 610.  The Defendant was negligent in the training and instruction of their agents and \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL employees. The Defendant failed to timely and properly educate and train, supervise, and/or \nFI\nmonitor their agents or employees with regard to policies and procedures that should be followed \nwhen sexual abuse of a child is suspected or observed.  \n611.  In negligently hiring, training, supervising, and retaining Plaintiffs’ abusers, and in \nfailing to establish such training procedures for employees and administrators, the Defendant failed \nto exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under similar \ncircumstances.  \n612.  It  was  reasonably  foreseeable  to  the  Defendant  that  their  failure  to  exercise \nreasonable care would result in sexual abuse of children in its custody, including Plaintiffs. \n613.  Plaintiffs would not have suffered the foreseeable harm complained of herein but \nfor the Defendant’s negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention of Plaintiffs’ abusers and \nthe negligent training and instruction of their other agents and employees.  \n614.  At all relevant times, the Defendant’s actions were negligent, willful, wanton, \nmalicious, reckless, grossly negligent, and outrageous in its disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights and \nsafety.  \n  119 \n\n615.  As a direct and proximate result of the above-described conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 discomfort, physical manifestations of emotional distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    disgrace, humiliation, and loss of enjoyment of life. They were prevented, and will continue to be \nA\n6 \n2\n9: prevented, from performing daily activities and obtaining the full enjoyment of life. They have \n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ sustained, and will continue to sustain, loss of earnings and earning capacity. They have incurred, \n2\n9/\nE: \nT and will continue to incur, expenses for medical and psychological treatment, therapy, and \nA\nD\nD \nE\nL counseling.  \nFI\nCOUNT VIII – Intentional and Negligent Establishment of Policies and Procedures and/or \nFailure to Follow Establish Policies and Procedures \n616.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count.  \n617.  Upon information and belief, at all relevant times, Defendant had certain policies \nand procedures in place to investigate concerns, allegations, or complaints regarding employee and \nagent conduct. Additionally, or in the alternative, Defendant intentionally and/or negligently \nestablished policies, practices, or customs that were a moving force of Plaintiffs’ injuries set forth \nherein.  \n618.  Defendant, by and through their authorized agents, servants, and/or employees, \nofficers, and directors, owed a duty to establish policies to benefit Plaintiffs and a duty to follow \nsuch policies and procedures as there were for the benefit of Plaintiffs, and breached that duty in \none or more of the following ways: \na.  failing to intervene and prevent acts of sexual misconduct by employees \nand agents; \n \n  120 \n\nb.  continuing to allow employees and agents to have unsupervised contact \nwith Plaintiffs in private and semi-private areas of the facilities; \n \n8\n2\n5 c.  failing to adequately supervise the employees and agents; \n0\n1\nL0  \n4\n02 d.  failing to protect Plaintiffs from harm; \n2\nM     \nA\n6  e.  failing to warn or advise Plaintiffs that certain employees and agents \n2\n9: posed a danger to Plaintiffs; \n4 \n2  \n0\n2\n3/ f.  failing to investigate the information, reports, rumors, complaints and \n2\nE: 9/ allegations concerning certain employees and agents’ sexual grooming \nT and/or sexual abuse of Plaintiffs; \nA\nD\nD   \nE\nL g.  attempting to conceal Plaintiffs’ sexual abuse at the hands of certain \nFI\nemployees and agents; \n \nh.  failing to make mandated reports of suspected child abuse under the \nAbused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, 325 ILCS 5/3 et seq.; \n \ni.  failing to train employees in the recognition and prevention of sexual \ngrooming and/or sexual abuse; \n \nj.  allowing  certain  employees  and  agents  to  remain  employed  at \nDefendant’s facilities after learning of the sexual grooming and/or sexual \nabuse of Plaintiffs; \n \nk.  failing to implement and/or to follow policies and procedures which \nintended to protect Plaintiffs from abuse by employees and agents of \nDefendant;  \n \nl.  failing to institute policies to prevent unmonitored access to juvenile \ndetainees  or  instituting  policies  that  caused  unmonitored  access  to \njuvenile detainees; and/or \n \nm. implementing policies, such as unconstitutional strip search policies, that \nwere a moving force of the abuse set forth herein. \n \n619.  As a direct and proximate result of one or more of the aforementioned negligent, \nwillful  and/or  wanton  acts  and/or  omissions,  Plaintiffs  were  subjected  to  sexual  abuse  and \nexploitation by employees and agents of Defendant and was caused to suffer the above injuries set \nforth herein. \n  121 \n\nDAMAGES AND BILL OF PARTICULARS\n620. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \n8\n2\n5\n0\n1\nL0 above as if fully stated in this Count.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    621. Each Plaintiff claims such damages as may be proven at trial, to include, but not \nA\n6 \n2\n9: necessarily be limited to the following:\n4 \n2\n0\n2\n3/ - Past, present, and future disabilityand loss of a normal life;  \n2\nE: 9/ - Past, present, and future, medical expenses, where applicable; \nT - Past, present, and future emotional distress; \nA\nD\nD  - Past, present, and future pain and suffering; \nE\nL - Past, present, and future lost wages and lost wage-earning capacity; \nFI\n- Pre- and post-judgment interest; and\n- All other damages permitted by law.\n622.

Based upon the \nbest information and belief, Plaintiffs allege the following: \nNATURE OF THE CLAIM \n1.  For  decades,  employees,  agents,  and  servants  of  County  of  Cook  County \n(“Defendant” or “Cook County”) and the State of Illinois vis a vis the Office of the Chief Judge \nof the Circuit Court of Cook County (“State”) sexually abused Plaintiffs and/or knowingly, \nintentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently allowed or failed to prevent sexual \nabuse of Plaintiffs while Plaintiffs were children in the legal and physical custody of Cook County \n  2 \n\nand/or the State of Illinois and confined at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center \n0 (formerly known as the Arthur J. Audy Home and hereinafter referred to as “JTDC”).  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 2.  As a result of chronic mismanagement, patronage, overcrowding, and inadequate \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    supervision, JTDC has been an environment of violence, fear, and sexual abuse for decades.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 3.  Cook County has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to \n2\n7/\nE: \nT ensure such protection. It furthermore employed individuals it knew or should have known would \nA\nD\nD \nE sexually abuse juveniles in its care and custody. \nL\nFI\n4.  In 1999, a federal class action lawsuit was filed against Cook County, citing staff-\non-youth physical abuse, filthy conditions, understaffing, lack of medical care, overcrowding, and \nexcessive use of room confinement.  \n5.  While JTDC was originally designed to house no more than 500 youth, it regularly \nhoused 600 and as many as 800 youth at one time, resulting in youth incarceration in “overflow” \nareas such as dayrooms with other youth. \n6.  The class-action lawsuit resulted in a settlement that required Cook County to \nimprove conditions at the facility. Years later, in August 2007, the federal court presiding over the \nclass action determined that Cook County was not complying with the terms of the settlement \nagreement and appointed a “Transitional Administrator” (“TA”) to oversee the transition of \noperations from Cook County to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County \n(“OCJ”) in anticipation of legislation mandating as much, and to bring JTDC into compliance with \nthe settlement agreement.  \n7.  To that end, in 2007, the State of Illinois passed Public Act 095-0194, House Bill \n236, stripping the Cook County Board of its statutory authority to administer and operate JTDC \n  3 \n\nand transferring the administrative, budgetary, and operational control of JTDC to the Chief Judge \n0 of the Circuit Court of Cook County, an arm of the State of Illinois  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 8.  The  State  of  Illinois  enacted  this  legislation  as  a  result  of  mismanagement, \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    patronage, and years of inhumane conditions at JTDC under Cook County’s authority.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 9.  The law went into effect on January 1, 2008 and mandated that the OCJ appoint a \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 new administrator to serve as superintendent of JTDC within 180 days. In mid-2008, the TA \n2\n7/\nE: \nT reported that JTDC was understaffed and needed more than 175 additional employees immediately \nA\nD\nD \nE in order to improve detainees’ care.  \nL\nFI\n10.  Despite knowing that Cook County was failing to improve conditions and that \nJTDC needed an urgent influx of 175 additional employees to improve detainees’ care, and despite \nthe Chief Judge’s lawful duty to appoint a new superintendent of JTDC, the Chief Judge neglected \nto so much as convene a search committee for the new head of JTDC until 2013 and failed to issue \nan appointment until 2015. \n11.  The TA worked in close contact and collaboration with the OCJ until May 20, 2015, \nat which time the Chief Judge’s appointment of a new superintendent, an agent of the State of \nIllinois by and through the OCJ, was formalized. During this interim period, the OCJ and/or Cook \nCounty exercised control and retained the right to control the facility in whole or in part.  \n12.  In 2022, a committee convened by the OCJ reported that JTDC is “isolating and \ndeprivational” rather than rehabilitative. Most youth at JTDC spent at least 13 hours per day locked \nin small cells during from, at minimum, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Many youth spent several more hours \nlocked in their room on top of these 13 hours per day as a result of JTDC staff’s misuse of room \nconfinement as a form of discipline.  \n  4 \n\n13.  The committee stated that “Semantics do not diminish the harsh reality that JTDC \n0 youth are locked in their cells for most of the day, every day…. No parent would be allowed to do \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 this to their child.” Moreover, the committee concluded that “JTDC does not meet its affirmative \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    duty to rehabilitate youth and help high-risk youth heal through trauma-informed, developmentally \nA\n1 \n4\n1: appropriate care,” and that “[t]he JTDC physical structure is inappropriate and should be replaced \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 with smaller, community-based facilities that have specialized programs.” \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 14.  Cook  County  implemented  systematic  and  unconstitutional  strip  searches  of \nA\nD\nD \nE juvenile inmates at JTDC during intake and throughout juveniles’ detention, which was a moving \nL\nFI\nforce of certain willful and wanton acts of sexual abuse perpetrated upon Plaintiffs. In addition to \nviolating the Constitution of the United States, these pervasive patterns and practices within JTDC \nprovided the opportunity for the sexual penetration and fondling of minors. While this conduct is \ncriminal and unconstitutional, it is also violative of the administrative regulations governing the \nIllinois Department of  Juvenile Justice, which  requires that strip searches be performed by \nmembers of the same sex outside the view of others, that they shall be performed only when there \nis a reasonable suspicion to believe that the youth is carrying contraband in the area searched, and \nthat they shall be performed by medically trained persons under sanitary conditions. 20 Ill. Adm. \nCode 2602.50(f)(1-4). Notwithstanding these written administrative regulations, the State of \nIllinois and Cook County perpetrated a policy and practice of strip-searching juveniles in an \nunlawful manner that caused the willful, wanton, and widespread sexual abuse of juveniles in its \ncustody.  \n15.  A 2023 Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice Inspection Report confirmed that \nthis official practice and policy of unlawful strip-searches at intake continued until as recently as \n2023. In addition to being violative of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of \n  5 \n\nIllinois, violative of governing administrative rules and regulations, it was also wholly ineffective \n0 in seizing contraband. In fact, between October 1, 2022 and April 30, 2022, JTDC conducted at \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 least 1,203 strip searches and not a single search resulted in finding contraband. In fact, between \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    June 1, 2022 and April 30, 2022, contraband was only found a total of four times, but only through \nA\n1 \n4\n1: use of the less-invasive wand or pat-down search on all four occasions.  \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 16.  The  Illinois  Department  of  Juvenile  Justice  also  reported  that  JTDC  staff \n2\n7/\nE: \nT implemented excessive room confinement of youth and left youth grievances unaddressed in some \nA\nD\nD \nE instances.  \nL\nFI\n17.  After passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”) in 2003, the State of \nIllinois and Cook County routinely and knowingly failed to implement and ensure compliance \nwith the prophylactic protections and requirements of the PREA, which was designed to eliminate \nsexual abuse of inmates.  \n18.  This action is brought pursuant to common law and the Childhood Sexual Abuse \nAct as codified at 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2, and its basis is in tort.  \n19.  This action alleges physical, psychological, and emotional injuries suffered as the \nresult of conduct constituting childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse as defined in Illinois \nCompiled Statute 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and negligence. \nJURISDICTION \n20.  Plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois and the venue of the Circuit \nCourt of Cook County pursuant to Section 5/2-103 and 5/2-209 of the Illinois Code of Civil \nProcedure as the principal office of Cook County, a public or governmental corporation, is located \nin Cook County and because the tortious acts giving rise to this action occurred in Cook County.  \n  6 \n\n21.  The Law Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County has jurisdiction over this \n0 action in that each Plaintiff seeks recovery of monetary damages in excess of $100,000.00 for \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 personal injuries under the Childhood Sexual Abuse Act as codified at 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    PARTIES \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 22.  Plaintiffs are adults who were resident adolescent citizens of the State of Illinois at \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the time of the acts described herein and were born on or after July 24, 1983. Plaintiffs bring this \n2\n7/\nE: \nT action using a pseudonym to shield their identities because they are particularly vulnerable parties \nA\nD\nD \nE as victims of sexual abuse. See Doe v. Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 19 N.E.3d 178, 191 (Ill. \nL\nFI\nApp. Ct. 2014). Moreover, Plaintiffs’ sexual abuse occurred while incarcerated at the Cook County \nJuvenile Temporary Detention Center, which pursuant to 55 ILCS 75/2 must meet the minimum \nstandards established by the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. 705 ILCS 405/1-8, et seq., \nprotects the identity of all juvenile individuals in the juvenile court system, and all such court \ndocuments “are sealed and may never be disclosed to the general public or otherwise made widely \navailable.” 705 ILCS 405/1-8(a). Moreover, revealing Plaintiffs’ identities as victims of childhood \nsexual  abuse  would  subject  Plaintiffs  and  their  families  to  compounded  humiliation, \nembarrassment, and emotional distress. Accordingly, filed concurrently herewith is a request for \nPlaintiffs to proceed using fictitious names pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-401(e) and to file this initial \npleading without identifying information except as otherwise provided herein. \n23.  Plaintiffs join their claims in this action pursuant to the Illinois Code of Civil \nProcedure 735 ILCS 5 et seq. as Plaintiffs’ right to relief arises out of the same transaction or series \nof transactions, and this action raises common questions of law or fact among all Plaintiffs against \nthe County of Cook County, Illinois \n24.

Moreover, \nPlaintiffs are presumed to have been unable to give knowing consent pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/11-\n0.1. \n  18 \n\nSexual Abuse of J.W. \n0 65.  When Plaintiff J.W. was 14 years old and housed at JTDC from the ages of 14 to \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 17, a nurse named Ms. Banks and a staff member named Officer Stewart, while acting in the course \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    and scope of their employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused J.W. from \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 2000 to 2003. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 66.  Ms. Banks was at all relevant times a light-skinned black female estimated to be in \n2\n7/\nE: \nT her mid 30s and approximately 5’9 in height. She often wore her hair in a ponytail. \nA\nD\nD \nE 67.  Officer Stewart was  at  all relevant times  a heavy-set black male of medium \nL\nFI\ncomplexion and approximately 6’1 in height. He was bald and wore a large ring on one hand.  \n68.  J.W. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n69.  In 2000 when J.W. was 14 years old, Stewart forced him to fight another inmate, \ncausing injuries for which he went to the medical unit. Banks, who was the evening shift nurse \nwithin the medical unit, told J.W. that he could stay outside of his cell longer in exchange for \nsexual favors. J.W. capitulated to this coercion, and Banks administered oral copulation on him.  \n70.  After this incident, J.W. Abuser 1 ultimately sexually abused him over 15 times \nacross multiple stays at JTDC between 2000 and 2003. The abuse included both oral copulation \nand sexual intercourse. On some occasions, staff members permitted Banks to keep J.W. in the \nmedical unit overnight, which allowed her to sexually abuse him multiple times in one day. Banks \nrepeatedly told J.W. to visit her once he was out of the facility, and that he could live with her once \nhe aged out of the system. She regularly gave him snacks and marijuana, as well as her personal \nphone number so she could continue the abuse outside of the facility, but he never attempted to \ncontact or visit her once he was released. \n  19 \n\n71.  When J.W. was 14 or 15 in 2000 or 2001, Stewart entered his cell during nightly \n0 head count and ordered him to undress. When J.W. refused, Stewart threatened to send him to the \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 segregation unit. Under this threat, Stewart forcefully undressed and raped J.W. Stewart sexually \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    abused J.W. in this manner over 30 times across multiple stays in Cook County between 2000 and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 2003. This abuse included both oral copulation and rape. During each stay at JTDC, J.W. was \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 almost always placed in the same cell within J.W.’s housing unit. The cell was made of glass, and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT the inside of the cell was fully visible from the TV area. During these repeated incidents of abuse, \nA\nD\nD \nE J.W. watched as staff members walked in and around the TV area but never attempted to stop the \nL\nFI\nabuse. Stewart gave J.W. extra food, cigarettes, and better jobs around the facility when he \ncomplied with the abuse. He threatened to revoke J.W.’s phone time and to send him to segregation \nif J.W. ever reported the abuse. J.W. repeatedly asked staff members to stop placing him on J.W. \nAbuser 2’s unit, but this request was typically denied. \n72.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n73.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff J.W. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n74.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \n  20 \n\nPlaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n0 reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    75.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff J.W., staff members \nA\n1 \n4\n1: were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n2\n7/\nE: \nT members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \nA\nD\nD \nE therefrom. \nL\nFI\n76.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of T.W. \n77.  When Plaintiff T.W. was 16 years old and housed at JTDC, a gym teacher named \nCoach Webber, a staff member named CO Yanni, and a science teacher (hereinafter “T.W. Abuser \n3” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope in their employment and under \nthe control of Cook County, sexually abused T.W. in 2005. \n  21 \n\n78.  Coach Webber was at all relevant times a black male of medium complexion \n0 estimated to be in his late 30s to early 40s and approximately 5’4 to 5’6 in height. He was bald, \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 slightly heavy-set, and had a goatee. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    79.  CO  Yanni  was  at  all  relevant  times  a  black  female  of  medium  complexion, \nA\n1 \n4\n1: estimated to be in her early 20s and approximately 5’5 to 5’6 in height. She alternatingly wore \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 sew-in hair weaves and her natural hair. \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 80.  T.W. Abuser 3 was at all relevant times a white male estimated to be in his late 30s \nA\nD\nD \nE to early 40s and approximately 5’11 to 6’0 in height. He had short gray hair, a large nose, and wore \nL\nFI\nglasses. \n81.  T.W. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n82.  Webber ran the facility’s gym and taught gym classes to T.W. and other youths. \nBefore and after gym classes, Webber regularly brought T.W. into his private office near the gym. \nOnce inside the office, Webber ordered him to undress and masturbate himself while he watched, \ntouched T.W.’s back, buttocks, and genitals, kissed his face and neck, and masturbated himself. \nWebber said that he had to comply with the abuse if he wanted to use the gym, and manipulated \nT.W. into believing that the abuse was a normal occurrence within the facility. He gave him \nrestaurant food and let him play video games as a reward for not disclosing the abuse. \n83.  On one occasion, a staff member entered Webber’s office while he was sexually \nabusing the Plaintiff. Webber took the staff member outside and spoke with him for a few minutes \nuntil the staff member left, upon which time Webber continued the sexual abuse. The staff member \nnever interacted with T.W. again, and no one in the facility followed up with T.W. regarding the \nsexual abuse. \n  22 \n\n84.  Yanni frequently escorted T.W. to the gym at Webber’s request and sometimes \n0 stood guard outside of Webber’s office as he abused T.W. On multiple occasions, Webber ordered \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 T.W. to administer oral copulation on Yanni while he watched and masturbated. Yanni frequently \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    fondled T.W.’s genitals and buttocks over and under the clothes. When T.W. was discharged from \nA\n1 \n4\n1: JTDC, Yanni gave him her phone number and said that he could call her if he wanted to “get \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 together” with her. T.W. was very uncomfortable and did not attempt to contact Yanni once he left \n2\n7/\nE: \nT the facility. \nA\nD\nD \nE 85.  Webber sexually abused T.W. approximately six to eight times over the course of \nL\nFI\nT.W.’s 30 day stay in 2015. Yanni sexually abused T.W. for approximately three of those \nincidents. \n86.  T.W. Abuser 3 was a science teacher and taught classes to T.W. and other youths \nduring the weekdays. On one occasion at the end of class, T.W. Abuser 3 gave T.W. a note which \ninstructed him to go to the nearby laundry room, masturbate, ejaculate on the note, and leave the \nnote inside the laundry room for T.W. Abuser 3 to retrieve. The note also said that T.W. Abuser 3 \nwould write a good report for T.W. if he complied and would take behavioral points from T.W. if \nhe refused. T.W. Abuser 3 successfully coerced T.W. into complying with the orders on the note. \nAfter this incident, T.W. Abuser 3 regularly touched and caressed T.W. over the clothes, kissed \nhis neck, and made sexual comments towards him every time he attended class. \n87.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n  23 \n\n88.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff T.W. was a minor in the legal and physical \n0 custody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 described sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    89.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n2\n7/\nE: \nT breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \nA\nD\nD \nE Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \nL\nFI\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n90.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.W., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n91.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \n  24 \n\nSexual Abuse of T.L. \n0 92.  When Plaintiff T.L. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC,  a staff  member \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 (hereinafter “T.L. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope in \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    their employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused T.L. from March to July \nA\n1 \n4\n1: of 2002. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 93.

T.L. expects to learn \nA\nD\nD \nE the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \nL\nFI\n94.  Starting in approximately March of 2002, T.L. Abuser 1 regularly followed T.L. \ninto the bathroom where he would grope T.L.’s private parts over the clothes and make sexual \ncomments. Eventually, T.L. Abuser 1 demanded sexual favors under the threat of physical harm \nand confinement. T.L. Abuser 1 groped and administered oral copulation to T.L. inside the \nfacility’s bathroom approximately three to four times a week for four months. On some occasions, \nT.L. Abuser 1 handcuffed T.L.’s hands and/or feet when he attempted to resist the abuse, then \nsexually abused T.L. while he was restrained. T.L. verbally reported T.L. Abuser 1’s sexually and \nphysically abusive behavior to a “white shirt” authority figure, but the white shirt did not believe \nT.L., and no one at the facility followed up with him regarding this report. \n95.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n  25 \n\n96.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff T.L. was a minor in the legal and physical \n0 custody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 described sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    97.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \n2\n7/\nE: \nT various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of \nA\nD\nD \nE known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the \nL\nFI\nabuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect \nthe Plaintiff.  \n98.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.L., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n99.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \n  26 \n\nSexual Abuse of L.R.  \n0 100.  When Plaintiff L.R. was 8 or 9 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 (hereinafter “L.R. Abuser 1” and “L.R. Abuser 2,” collectively “L.R. Abusers,” unless otherwise \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    indicated), while acting in the course and scope in their employment and under the control of Cook \nA\n1 \n4\n1: County, sexually abused L.R. in 1995 or 1996. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 101.

L.R. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n104.  As part of L.R.’s intake process, L.R. Abusers brought him into the intake room \nand ordered him to undress. Under the guise of a strip search, L.R. Abuser 1 groped and fondled \nL.R.’s naked body, grabbed and squeezed his genitals for approximately 20 seconds, and rubbed \nhis fingers down the middle of L.R.’s buttocks while L.R. Abuser 2 watched and made sexual \ncomments.  \n105.  These strip searches were conducted upon L.R. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n106.  Approximately one week after this strip search, L.R. Abusers entered the bathroom \nwhile L.R. was taking a shower and demanded sexual favors from him under the threat of physical \nharm. L.R. Abuser 2 forced L.R. to give him oral copulation while L.R. Abuser 1 watched, \n  27 \n\nmasturbated, and ejaculated on L.R.’s face. One of the L.R. Abusers gave L.R. an extra slice of \n0 pizza at dinner afterwards. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 107.  Approximately three to four days after this incident, L.R. Abusers entered L.R.’s \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    cell and ordered him to follow them to the cell of another youth. L.R. Abusers then forced L.R. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: and the other youth to perform oral copulation on each other while L.R. Abusers watched and \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 masturbated, again under the threat of physical harm. L.R. Abusers told L.R. and the other youth \n2\n7/\nE: \nT that they “better not say nothing or we’ll hurt you,” and additionally threatened to revoke L.R.’s \nA\nD\nD \nE meals and extend his sentence so he could “never go home.” \nL\nFI\n108.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n109.

Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \nPlaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n  28 \n\n111.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff L.R., staff members \n0 were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \nA\n1 \n4\n1: therefrom. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 112.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nA\nD\nD \nE Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nL\nFI\nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of R.B.  \n113.

R.B. expects to learn the full names and identities of her abusers through the course \n0 of discovery. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 117.  During her first week at JTDC, R.B. was walking back from school when R.B. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Abuser 1 approached her in the hallway and pulled her aside to a small alcove in the hallway. R.B. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Abuser 1 forcefully grabbed R.B.’s breasts over the clothes, then put his hands under her clothes \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 to grope her breasts and rub her genitals. R.B. Abuser 1 then digitally penetrated R.B. hard enough \n2\n7/\nE: \nT to cause severe pain. R.B. was pregnant and in an advanced trimester at the time of abuse such that \nA\nD\nD \nE she worried that this penetration would harm the baby or induce labor.  \nL\nFI\n118.  During this abuse, R.B. Abuser 1 verbally harassed her, stating that “this is what \nyou get” and “this is what happens to girls like you [inside the facility].” R.B. Abuser 1 sexually \nabused R.B. in this manner approximately five to seven more times over the course of her her short \nstay at the facility. When R.B. attempted to resist the abuse, R.B. Abuser 1 told her that he would \nphysically harm her and report her for causing trouble if she did not comply. \n119.  During her time at the facility, R.B. had special permission to shower and use the \nbathroom more frequently due to her pregnancy. R.B. Abuser 2 regularly followed R.B. into the \nbathroom and made sexual comments about her breasts, body, and pubic hair, and said that she \ndeserved this harassment because she was “just a whore anyways” due to her pregnancy. When \nR.B. was the only one in the bathroom, R.B. Abuser 2 regularly groped, slapped, and pinched \nR.B.’s breasts while making sexual and demeaning comments. The facility allotted R.B. extra \nsnacks between meals due to her pregnancy; if R.B. attempted to resist R.B. Abuser 2’s abuse, she \nrevoked these extra snacks. R.B. Abuser 2 verbally harassed R.B. four to five times a week over \nthe course of her stay at the facility, and the sexual touching occurring approximately two to three \ntimes a week. \n  30 \n\n120.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \n0 were nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 121.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff R.B. was a minor in the legal and physical \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 custody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\n2\n7/\nE: \nT described sexual abuse and/or acts. \nA\nD\nD \nE 122.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nL\nFI\nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \nPlaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n123.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff R.B., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n124.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n  31 \n\nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \n0 perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Plaintiff. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Sexual Abuse of C.J.  \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 125.  When Plaintiff C.J. was 14 and housed at JTDC, two staff members (hereinafter \n2\n7/\nE: \nT “C.J. Abuser 1” and “C.J. Abuser 2,” collectively “C.J. Abusers,” unless otherwise indicated), \nA\nD\nD \nE while acting in the course and scope in their employment and under the control of Cook County, \nL\nFI\nsexually abused C.J. in 2004 and 2005. \n126.  C.J. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a heavy-set black male estimated to be in his \nlate 30s and approximately 6’0 in height. \n127.  C.J. Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a black female estimated to be in her mid \n40s to early 50s and approximately 5’8 in height. She had short black hair. \n128.  C.J. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nof discovery. \n129.  Approximately five to six months into C.J.’s stay at JTDC, C.J. Abuser 1 began \nentering C.J.’s cell during nightly count time. Initially C.J. Abuser 1 approached him in a friendly \nmanner and made conversation with him from the doorway of his cell, but he eventually started to \nenter the cell and touch C.J.’s genitals over the clothes. After a few weeks of this conduct, C.J. \nAbuser 1 touched C.J.’s genitals under the clothes during these nightly visits, then escalated to \nmanual  masturbation,  oral  copulation,  and  sodomy.  C.J.  Abuser  1  sexually  abused  C.J. \napproximately twice a week for three to six months. C.J. Abuser 1 locked C.J. in his cell for days \nat a time and revoked his phone calls when C.J. attempted to resist the abuse or if C.J. Abuser 1 \n  32 \n\nthought he would report the abuse. He gave C.J. extra time in the day room, outside food from the \n0 staff room, and the chance to play video games as a reward for complying with the abuse. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 130.  C.J. verbally reported C.J. Abuser 1’s sexually abusive behavior to a “white shirt” \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    authority figure as well as a community group activist. Both the white shirt and the activist \nA\n1 \n4\n1: dismissed his report and said that he was lying about the abuse to get attention and avoid trouble. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 No one else at the facility followed up regarding these incidents, and C.J. Abuser 1 continued to \n2\n7/\nE: \nT sexually abuse C.J. for several months after the attempted reports. \nA\nD\nD \nE 131.  A few weeks after C.J. Abuser 1 started sexually abusing C.J., C.J. Abuser 2 entered \nL\nFI\nC.J.’s cell late at night and grabbed his genitals over the clothes and made a sexual comment \nimplying that she heard about C.J. Abuser 1’s sexually abusive behavior. Two times after this \nincident, C.J. Abuser 2 manually masturbated C.J., administered oral copulation on him, and had \nsexual intercourse with him inside his cell during the late-night shift. C.J. Abuser 2 gave C.J. extra \ntime in the yard and allowed him to stay up later as a reward for complying with the abuse. C.J. \nfelt as though C.J. Abusers were working together to alternatively punish and reward him, as they \nboth gave him extra privileges and took away his privileges in concordance with one another. \n132.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n133.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff C.J. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n  33 \n\n134.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \n0 that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n2\n7/\nE: \nT and to protect the Plaintiff.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 135.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff C.J., staff members \nL\nFI\nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n136.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of T.D.  \n137.  When Plaintiff T.D. was 16 years old housed at JTDC, a staff member (hereinafter \n“T.D. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope in their \n  34 \n\nemployment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused T.D. in late 2003 or early \n0 2004. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 138.  T.D. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a stocky, dark-skinned black male estimated \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    to be in his late 30s and approximately 5’7 to 5’8 in height. He had a short fade haircut and wore \nA\n1 \n4\n1: glasses. T.D. expects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 discovery. \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 139.  T.D. and several other youths were being escorted by T.D. Abuser 1 and another \nA\nD\nD \nE male staff member between the tunnel that connects the Cook County magistrate court and the \nL\nFI\nintake room within JTDC. T.D. was handcuffed to another inmate beside him by his left arm. T.D. \nAbuser 1 suddenly stopped the handcuffed youths and ordered them to strip and line up against \nthe wall for a strip search. T.D. became very uncomfortable and did not immediately comply. T.D. \nAbuser 1 told the other staff member to forcefully undress T.D. and press him against the wall. \nThe staff member did so, and painfully pushed T.D.’s face and chest against the wall. T.D. Abuser \n1 then forcefully digitally penetrated T.D.’s anus, enough to cause him severe pain.  \n140.  These strip searches were conducted upon T.D. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n141.  One to two days after this incident, T.D. reported the abuse to a female staff member \nnamed Officer Brown. Brown told T.D. that it was the abuser’s word against his and that no one \nwould believe him since inmates lied about sexual abuse. A few days after telling Brown, T.D. \nflagged down a “white hat” authority figure and again verbally reported T.D. Abuser 1’s sexually \nabusive behavior. The white hat laughed and said that he did not believe T.D.  \n  35 \n\n142.  In the last few days of T.D.’s approximately two-week stay, T.D. reported the \n0 incident to a male staff member named Officer Moe. Moe said that there was nothing the facility \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 could do about the abuse and that there would be “no point” of reporting the abuse to any of his \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    superiors. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 143.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 were nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nA\nD\nD \nE ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \nL\nFI\n144.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff T.D. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n145.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of \nknown perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the \nabuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect \nthe Plaintiff.  \n146.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.D., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n  36 \n\n147.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n0 omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nA\n1 \n4\n1: employees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \n2\n7/\nE: \nT make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nA\nD\nD \nE Plaintiff. \nL\nFI\nSexual Abuse of D.P. \n148.

D.P. expects \nto learn the full name and identity of her abuser through the course of discovery. \n150.  Throughout D.P.’s entire stay at JTDC, D.P. Abuser 1 regularly pulled D.P. aside, \nsometimes along with one to two other youths, and took her to her cell, or occasionally the \nbathroom if it was empty. There, D.P. Abuser 1 ordered her to take off her clothes and forcefully \nundressed her if she refused to comply. Once she was undressed, D.P. Abuser 1 stood and stared \nat D.P.’s naked body for several minutes at a time, often making sexual comments about her body \nand pregnancy (D.P. was visibly pregnant during the period of abuse). On some occasions, D.P. \nAbuser 1 groped D.P.’s naked body and grabbed and slapped her breasts and buttocks. D.P. Abuser \n1 sexually abused D.P. in this manner approximately one to three times a day for six months. D.P. \n  37 \n\nAbuser 1 also grabbed and groped D.P.’s breasts and buttocks over the clothes on a daily basis \n0 throughout the facility, and often made demeaning sexual comments towards her. When D.P. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 attempted to resist the touching or undressing, D.P. Abuser 1 struck her on the face, breasts, or \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    belly. She often said that she would take away her baby once she gave birth, and that she would \nA\n1 \n4\n1: “never see her baby again” if she didn’t comply with her sexually abusive behavior. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 151.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.P., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n  38 \n\nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n0 therefrom. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 155.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n2\n7/\nE: \nT employees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nA\nD\nD \nE perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nL\nFI\nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of A.G.  \n156.

Multiple staff members, both male and female, fondled his genitals and \nsearched around his anus while making sexual comments about M.A.’s body and genitals. When \nM.A. attempted to resist the sexually abusive behavior of M.A. Abusers, they locked him inside \nhis cell for extended periods of time, ranging from a few hours to several days. M.A. Abusers \nconducted these strip searches on a daily basis. \n178.  These strip searches were conducted upon M.A. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n  43 \n\n179.  Additionally, Ms. C sexually abused M.A. independently from the strip searches. \n0 Ms. C was at all relevant times a black female estimated to be in her late 20s and approximately \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 5’8 in height. She wore long sew-in braids in her hair and worked the late night shift. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    180.  Ms. C regularly made sexual comments towards M.A. and frequently said that he \nA\n1 \n4\n1: could come live with and have sexual intercourse with her once he was discharged from the \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 facility. After a few months of this behavior, Ms. C entered M.A.’s cell while the other youths \n2\n7/\nE: \nT were asleep and offered him cigarettes and extra food if he allowed her to masturbate him, a \nA\nD\nD \nE coercive tactic which proved successful. She threatened to lock him inside his cell for days at a \nL\nFI\ntime if he ever disclosed the abuse to his family or other staff members in the facility. Ms. C \nsexually abused M.A. in this manner approximately three more times after this incident. \n181.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n182.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff M.A. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n183.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \nPlaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n  44 \n\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n0 and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 184.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff M.A., staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n2\n7/\nE: \nT therefrom. \nA\nD\nD \nE 185.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nL\nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of P.H.  \n186.

Abuser 1 had P.H. undress and lay \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 down, at which point he masturbated P.H. and measured his erect genitals. P.H. Abuser 1 offered \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    P.H. cigarettes as a reward for complying with the “physical.” About a month later, P.H. visited \nA\n1 \n4\n1: the medical unit so he could get treatment for his asthma. P.H. Abuser 1 again had P.H. undress \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and lay down, then masturbated the Plaintiff. P.H. left the facility shortly after this second incident.  \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 189.

Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n  46 \n\nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n0 therefrom. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 193.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n2\n7/\nE: \nT employees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nA\nD\nD \nE perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nL\nFI\nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of D.D.  \n194.

Abuser 1 escorted \nher to and from these court hearings and frequently pulled her into an isolated area near the hallway \n(a corner, a service elevator, a nearby closet, etc.) and fondled her buttocks and genitals over the \nclothes. On one occasion, he put his hand down her pants and rubbed her genitals for an extended \n  47 \n\nperiod. On another occasion, he unzipped his pants and exposed his genitals, then grabbed D.D.’s \n0 wrist and forced her to touch his genitals. He once offered her a Snickers candy bar in exchange \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 for sexual favors, but she refused. When D.D. attempted to resist the abuse, D.D.

Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n  56 \n\nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \n0 perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Plaintiff. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Sexual Abuse of S.M.  \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 234.  When Plaintiff S.M. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, multiple staff members, \n2\n7/\nE: \nT while acting in the course and scope in their employment and under the control of Cook County, \nA\nD\nD \nE sexually abused S.M. in 2004 or 2005. \nL\nFI\n235.  During her stay at JTDC, S.M. attended regular court hearings which were held in \nthe same building as the detention facility. Every time she went to and from court, a group of staff \nmembers in charge of escorting youths to and from the court house performed strip searches on \nS.M. inside the facility’s intake room. During these strip searches, a group of two to four staff \nmembers, both male and female, ordered S.M. to undress, lift her own breasts, and squat and \ncough. These strip searches happened approximately 10 to 14 times over the course of S.M.’s \napproximately three month stay at JTDC. Approximately four times, these staff members digitally \npenetrated S.M. as part of this strip search. On some occasions, the staff members on her housing \nunit conducted a second strip search inside her cell after she returned from court, despite the fact \nthat she had already been strip searched in the intake room mere minutes beforehand. \n236.  These strip searches were conducted upon S.M. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n237.  One of the staff members named Ms. Mac conducted the housing unit strip searches \nalso sexually abused S.M. independently from the strip searches. Ms. Mac was at all relevant times \n  57 \n\na heavy-set black female estimated to be in her late 30s to early 40s and approximately 5’11 in \n0 height. She had tattoos on her arms. S.M. expects to learn the full name and identity of her abuser \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 through the course of discovery. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    238.  Mac was a “white shirt” authority figure who regularly made sexual comments \nA\n1 \n4\n1: towards S.M. and other youths in the facility. While S.M. was showering, Mac approached her \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 while she was showering and said that she wasn’t cleaning herself right, then used her bare hands \n2\n7/\nE: \nT to touch S.M.’s genitals and buttocks for several minutes at a time. S.M. became uncomfortable \nA\nD\nD \nE and pushed her away, so Mac locked her inside her cell for 24 hours as punishment for resisting \nL\nFI\nthe abuse. Mac sexually abused S.M. in this manner one more time after this incident, and again \nlocked her inside her cell for 24 hours when she resisted the abuse. S.M. reported Mac’s sexually \nabusive behavior to another staff member, but the staff member said that since S.M. Abuser 1 was \na white shirt she could face no repercussions for the sex abuse. \n239.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n240.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff S.M. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n241.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn \n  58 \n\nPlaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n0 reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    242.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff S.M., staff members \nA\n1 \n4\n1: were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n2\n7/\nE: \nT members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \nA\nD\nD \nE therefrom. \nL\nFI\n243.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of J.M.  \n244.  When Plaintiff J.M. was 11 or 12 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff member \n(hereinafter “J.M. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope in \ntheir employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused J.M. in approximately \n2004. \n  59 \n\n245.  J.M. Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a black female estimated to be in her 30s or \n0 40s. She had a deep voice. J.M. expects to learn the full name and identity of her abuser through \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 the course of discovery. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    246.  Starting from the first few days of J.M.’s stay at the facility, J.M. Abuser 1 \nA\n1 \n4\n1: frequently gave J.M. extra food and allowed her to do extra chores around the facility in exchange \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 for extra time out of her cell. While she did these chores, J.M. Abuser 1 caressed her arms, back, \n2\n7/\nE: \nT and neck over the clothes and made sexual comments towards her. On one occasion, J.M. Abuser \nA\nD\nD \nE 1 said to “come here and let me squeeze a little something,” then reached her hand down J.M.’s \nL\nFI\npants and digitally penetrated her for 30 to 60 seconds with an ungloved hand. This digital \npenetration was not part of a strip search. J.M. Abuser 1 sexually abused J.M. in this manner one \nor two more times after this incident over the course of J.M.’s one-to-two week stay at the facility. \n247.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n248.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff J.M. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n249.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of \nknown perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the \n  60 \n\nabuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect \n0 the Plaintiff.  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 250.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff J.M., staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n2\n7/\nE: \nT therefrom. \nA\nD\nD \nE 251.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nL\nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of P.J.  \n252.  When Plaintiff P.J. was 12 years old and housed at JTDC, a “white shirt” authority \nfigure named Fullilove while acting in the course and scope in their employment and under the \ncontrol of Cook County, sexually abused P.J. in 2003. \n253.  Fullilove was at all relevant times a dark-skinned black male approximately 6’1 to \n6’2 in height. P.J. expects to learn the full name and identity of her abuser through the course of \ndiscovery. \n  61 \n\n254.  Fullilove was a high-ranking “white shirt” authority figure who had his own office \n0 and held significant influence over the youths of JTDC. Within the first few weeks of P.J.’s stay \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 at JTDC, Fullilove entered P.J.’s cell during “quiet hour,” a period during the day where youths \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were kept inside their cells, and offered to let her out of her cell if she helped him clean up around \nA\n1 \n4\n1: his office. He then led her into his office and said that he would extend her sentence at the facility \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 unless she gave him sexual favors. After this incident, Fullilove regularly entered P.J.’s cell during \n2\n7/\nE: \nT quiet hour approximately four times a week, then brought her to his office or the stairwell near his \nA\nD\nD \nE office where he groped her chest, digitally penetrated her, forced her to masturbate him, and forced \nL\nFI\nher  to  administer  oral  copulation  on  him.  This  abuse  occurred  on  a  near-daily  basis  for \napproximately six months. Fullilove allowed P.J. extra phone calls, extra time outside of her out \nof her cell, and chips and candy as a reward for complying with the abuse. \n255.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n256.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff P.J., staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n2\n7/\nE: \nT therefrom. \nA\nD\nD \nE 259.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nL\nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \nSexual Abuse of Z.R.  \n260.

As Z.R. exited the shower, Cook groped her bare breast and made a sexual \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    comment about her body. Z.R. was uncomfortable and quickly exited the bathroom.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 263.  A few weeks after this incident, Cook approached Z.R. in her cell, where she groped \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 her breasts under the clothes and caressed her nipples while making sexual comments. Z.R. was \n2\n7/\nE: \nT afraid and froze up while Cook touched her.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 264.  A few days after this second incident, Cook again approached her in her cell and \nL\nFI\nsaid that it was “perfectly natural” for Z.R. to be attracted to adult women, that “me touching you \nwould be no different to your girlfriend touching you,” and that she should just relax and allow \nCook to sexually abuse her. She then groped Z.R.’s breasts under the clothes, caressed her nipples, \nand rubbed her genitals under the clothes. Cook made sexual comments towards Z.R. and groped \nher breasts, buttocks, and genitals over the clothes on a near daily basis whenever she saw her \nacross her multiple stays at Cook County between 1999 and 2003. She often told Z.R. that no one \nelse at the facility would believe her if she reported the sexual abuse, and that she would get in \ntrouble for lying and “never go home” as a result. She gave her extra food and snacks as a reward \nfor not disclosing the abuse to other staff members. \n265.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n  64 \n\n266.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff Z.R., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n269.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff K.S., staff members \n2\n7/\nE: \nT were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\nD\nD \nE belief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nL\nFI\nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n277.

T.W. 2 expects to \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    280.  Several months into T.W. 2’s stay at JTDC, House ordered T.W. 2 to follow him \nA\n1 \n4\n1: to the third-floor bathroom towards the back of the unit. T.W. 2 complied, and when he entered \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the bathroom House called in two other incarcerated youths and ordered them to forcefully undress \n2\n7/\nE: \nT T.W. and hold him face-down on the floor.

There, T.W. 2 told the doctor about House raping him, so the doctor inspected his anus \nand also confirmed the serious injuries to the area due to the sexual assault and gave him numbing \ncream for the pain. \n282.  When T.W. 2 returned to JTDC, he was transferred to another unit and verbally \nreported House’s sexually abusive behavior to several staff members, who all dismissed his report \nand said that he was lying. \n283.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at JTDC.  \n  68 \n\n284.

A few hours later, Mr. C entered his cell and said that he would get F.C. a “yellow shirt” \nA\n1 \n4\n1: if he did not disclose the previous abuse to anyone. Receiving a “yellow shirt” was a privilege at \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 JTDC, as it gave youths many extra privileges such as extra TV time, extra food, better cells, and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT coveted chores such as folding laundry or late-night cleaning time. F.C. agreed, and Mr. C made \nA\nD\nD \nE him a yellow shirt in exchange for his silence on the sexual abuse.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.M. 2, staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \nmembers directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \ntherefrom. \n994.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \n  277 \n\nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n0 the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 employees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nA\n1 \n4\n1: make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Plaintiff. \n2\n7/\nE: \nT Sexual Abuse of A.M.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 995.  When  Plaintiff  A.M.  was  16  years  old  and  housed  at  JTDC,  four  Youth \nL\nFI\nDevelopment Specialists named Alphonso Ward, Timothy Williams, Michael Washington, and Ms. \nSterling, while acting in the course and scope of their employment and under the control of Cook \nCounty and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook \nCounty,, sexually abused A.M. from November of 2011 to November of 2012. \n996.  Alphonso Ward was at all relevant times a black male estimated to be in his early \nto mid 50s and approximately 6’0 to 6’1 in height. He had a short afro and gray-and-black facial \nhair. He worked the morning shift. \n997.  Timothy Williams was at all relevant times a heavy-set black male estimated to be \nin his late 50s to early 60s and approximately 5’10 and 5’11 in height. He wore glasses, had a deep, \nraspy voice, and walked with a limp due to an injured right leg. He worked the morning shift. \n998.  Michael Washington was at all relevant times a black male of above-average height \nestimated to be in his mid 30s to early 40s. He was bald and had full facial hair. He worked second \nshift. \n999.  Ms. Sterling was at all relevant times a black female estimated to be in her mid 20s \nto early 30s and approximately 5’6 to 5’7 in height. She was very heavy-set, wore glasses, and had \n  278 \n\na high-pitched voice. She worked second shift. A.M. expects to learn the full name and identity of \n0 his abuser through the course of discovery. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1000.  A few months into A.M.’s stay at JTDC in approximately January or February of \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    2012, Ward brought breakfast to A.M. early and said that he was taking his shower by himself \nA\n1 \n4\n1: before the other youths. He escorted him to the bathroom, stared at his body while he took a \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 shower, then escorted him back to his cell. Once they returned to the cell, Ward started to make \n2\n7/\nE: \nT sexual comments towards the Plaintiff. A.M. felt uncomfortable and tried to leave, but Ward \nA\nD\nD \nE blocked the cell door and forcibly pushed him onto his bed. He then masturbated A.M., digitally \nL\nFI\npenetrated him, and raped him. Immediately after the abuse, he brought him outside food and said \nnot to tell anybody about the incident. After this incident, Ward regularly made sexual comments \ntowards A.M. and gave him extra privileges, such as extra recreational time and outside food. He \nfrequently threatened to take away these extra privileges and send him to confinement if he ever \ndisclosed the abuse. \n1001.  A few weeks after the incident with Ward, Williams brought A.M. breakfast early \nand waited by his cell until the other youths were let out for school. Williams pulled A.M. aside \nand said that he needed him to clean around the housing unit. As A.M. cleaned, Williams made \nsexual comments towards him, and stated that he heard about the incident of sex abuse with Ward \nand asked why Ward was “so special.” Williams then brought A.M. back to his cell, where he \nforcibly digitally penetrated and raped him. Williams sexually abused A.M. in this manner two \nmore times after this incident. He gave A.M. several gifts and special privileges, such as outside \nfood, a radio, and a watch, and he threatened to take away these privileges if he ever disclosed the \nabuse. \n  279 \n\n1002.  A few months after the incident with Williams, A.M. entered the bathroom within \n0 the gym and Washington followed him inside. He said that he heard about the incidents of sex \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 abuse with Ward and Williams, and that he wanted the “same experience” with the Plaintiff. A.M. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    became frightened and tried to leave the bathroom, but A.M. blocked the entrance and pushed him \nA\n1 \n4\n1: to the ground. He demanded oral copulation, but A.M. refused, so he pulled down A.M.’s pants \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and forcefully digitally penetrated him. After the abuse, he frequently made sexual comments \n2\n7/\nE: \nT towards A.M. and gave him extra privileges, such as extra recreational time and outside food. He \nA\nD\nD \nE often threatened to take away these privileges if A.M. ever disclosed the abuse. \nL\nFI\n1003.  A few months after the incident with Washington, A.M. was leaving his cell for \nrecreational time when Sterling pulled him aside to discuss an alleged disciplinary incident. She \nthen made sexual comments towards A.M. and implied that she heard about the incident of sex \nabuse with Washington. A.M. became uncomfortable and asked to return to his cell so he could \nnap, and Sterling responded that he could “go to sleep when you’re done with me.” She brought \nhim to his cell, where she forced him to administer oral copulation on her. After this incident, A.M. \nwarned other youths about Sterling’s sexually abusive behavior. When she learned of this, she \nrevoked his recreational time and commissary items. For the remainder of his sentence, she \nfrequently sent him to confinement for several days at a time over very minor infractions as further \npunishment for disclosing the sexual abuse. \n1004.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  280 \n\n1005.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff A.M. was a minor in the legal and physical \n0 custody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1006.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n2\n7/\nE: \nT breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nA\nD\nD \nE abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nL\nFI\nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n1007.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff A.M., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1008.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \n Sexual Abuse of D.J. \n1009.  When Plaintiff D.J. was 15 or 16 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members \nnamed Brown and Martinelli, while acting in the course and scope of their employment and under \n  281 \n\nthe control of Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the \n0 Circuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused D.J. in 2013. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1010.  Brown was at all relevant times a heavy-set black male estimated to be in his late \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    20s to early 30s and approximately 6’0 in height. He was bald and had a beard. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1011.  Martinelli was at all relevant times a white male estimated to be in his 30s or 40s \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and approximately 5’11 in height. He had short, curly, brown hair and was previously in the \n2\n7/\nE: \nT military. \nA\nD\nD \nE 1012.  D.J. expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the course \nL\nFI\nof discovery. \n1013.  On multiple occasions, Brown and Martinelli physically restrained D.J. and carried \nhim back to his cell. Once inside his cell, Martinelli groped and fondled D.J.’s genitals over and \nunder the clothes, digitally penetrated his anus, and made sexual comments about his body and \ngenitals, all while Brown restrained D.J. and watched the abuse. Brown and Martinelli sexually \nabused D.J. in this manner approximately seven to eight times total. \n1014.  Brown and Martinelli regularly conducted pat-downs and strip searches on D.J., \nduring which they would grab and fondle his genitals and buttocks over and under the clothes for \nextended periods for purposes of sexual gratification. On some occasions, Brown and Martinelli \nsearched D.J. together, and on other occasions they searched him individually. \n1015.  These strip searches were conducted upon D.J. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n1016.  Whenever Brown supervised the shower area, he regularly watched D.J. and other \nyouths while they were showering  and attempted to look at their genitals. This made D.J. \n  282 \n\nuncomfortable, as the other staff members preferred to keep their backs to the showers and avoided \n0 looking at the youths while they were naked whenever possible. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1017.  When D.J. attempted to resist the above sexual abuse, Brown and Martinelli put \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    him in confinement for 24 to 48 hours at a time and dropped him down a level on his behavioral \nA\n1 \n4\n1: chart, which revoked certain privileges such as phone time and time outside of his cell. They gave \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 him contraband food (M&M’s, food from the staff vending machine) as a reward for enduring the \n2\n7/\nE: \nT abuse. \nA\nD\nD \nE 1018.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nL\nFI\nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1019.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff D.J. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n1020.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \noccurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \nbreached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nabuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n1021.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.J., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n  283 \n\nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n0 staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 arising therefrom.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1022.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n2\n7/\nE: \nT the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nA\nD\nD \nE employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nL\nFI\nSexual Abuse of J.J. 3  \n1023.  When Plaintiff J.J. 3 was between the ages of 13 and 15 and housed at JTDC, a staff \nmember Mr. Servich, while acting in the course and scope of his employment and under the control \nof Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \nof Cook County, sexually abused J.J. 3 in 2011 and 2012. \n1024.  Mr. Servich was at all relevant times a light-skinned black male estimated to be in \nhis 30s and approximately 6’1 in height. He had short hair. J.J. 3 expects to learn the full name and \nidentity of her abuser through the course of discovery. \n1025.  J.J. 3 was confined in JTDC several times between 2011 and 2012, with each stay \nlasting a few weeks long. Once she was recognized as a “regular” at the facility, Servich started to \ngive her special privileges such as extra phone calls and food from McDonald’s. Eventually, \nServich entered J.J. 3’s cell late at night and told her that he would revoke her special privileges \nunless she allowed him to grope her. From this point forward, Servich entered J.J. 3’s cell late at \nnight and groped her thighs, breasts, and genitals over the clothes. After a few incidents of this \nbehavior he forcefully undressed her, groped her naked body and breasts, forced her to give oral \n  284 \n\ncopulation, digitally penetrated her, and raped her. Servich sexually abused J.J. 3 in this manner \n0 every time he was on shift, which was close to daily, throughout her multiple stays between 2011 \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 and 2012. During one of her final stays at JTDC, Servich offered J.J. 3 “a better life” with him and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    gave her his cell phone number. J.J. 3 was scared and uncomfortable with this and never contacted \nA\n1 \n4\n1: him once she left the facility. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1026.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \n2\n7/\nE: \nT were non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nA\nD\nD \nE and Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \nL\nFI\n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1027.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff J.J. 3 was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n1028.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff J.J. 3, staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n  285 \n\nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \n0 arising therefrom.  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1030.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nA\n1 \n4\n1: Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n2\n7/\nE: \nT employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nA\nD\nD \nE Sexual Abuse of R.B. 2  \nL\nFI\n1031.  When Plaintiff R.B. 2 was 16 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff member \n(hereinafter “R.B. 2 Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope \nof his employment and under the control of Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis \nOffice of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused R.B. 2 from \napproximately June to September of 2008. \n1032.

He was bald, had a beard, and was part \nof the Black Stones gang. R.B. 2 expects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through \nthe course of discovery. \n1033.  Early in R.B. 2’s three month stay at JTDC, R.B. 2 Abuser 1 frequently entered the \nbathroom while R.B. 2 and other youths showered before bed. On these occasions, R.B. 2 Abuser \n1 made sexual comments about R.B. 2’s body, “helped” him undress and dry off with a towel, and \ncaressed his back, neck, and buttocks while he showered. Eventually, R.B. 2 Abuser 1 entered the \nbathroom while R.B. 2 was alone and said that he would give him marijuana and alcohol in \nexchange  for  sexual  favors.  R.B.  2 Abuser  1  then  administered  oral  copulation  on  R.B.  2 \n  286 \n\nImmediately after the abuse, R.B. 2 Abuser 1 told R.B. 2 that if he ever reported the incident, he \n0 would accuse R.B. 2 of initiating sexual advances and extend his sentence as punishment. After \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 this incident, R.B. 2 Abuser 1 sexually abused R.B. 2 in this manner one more time. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1034.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nA\n1 \n4\n1: were non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 1035.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff R.B. 2, staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n  287 \n\n1038.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n0 omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nA\n1 \n4\n1: employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Sexual Abuse of K.R. 2  \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 1039.  When Plaintiff K.R. 2 was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, a medical staff \nA\nD\nD \nE member (hereinafter “K.R. 2 Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and \nL\nFI\nscope of his employment and under the control of Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a \nvis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused K.R. 2 in 2012. \n1040.  K.R. 2 Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a white male estimated to be in his 40s. \nHe was balding and wore glasses and a white coat. K.R. 2 expects to learn the full name and \nidentity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n1041.  Within the first few days of K.R. 2’s arrival at JTDC, K.R. 2 was sent to the medical \nunit for an intake checkup. K.R. 2 Abuser 1 ordered K.R. 2 to undress and lay down on the \nexamination table and then caressed and fondled K.R. 2’s naked body under the guise of a \n“physical.” K.R. 2 Abuser 1 then asked K.R. 2 how often he masturbated and had sex, and he made \nsexual comments about K.R. 2’s appearance and genitals. He then started to masturbate K.R. 2 in \nan attempt to make him erect. K.R. 2 asked what he was doing, and K.R. 2 Abuser 1 stated that the \ngenital groping was just “part of the procedure,” and told K.R. 2 to “play with himself often” so \nthat he would not be “overloaded.” K.R. 2 Abuser 1 continued to masturbate K.R. 2 for 30 to 60 \nmore seconds, then finished the rest of the physical and dismissed K.R. 2 from the medical unit. \n  288 \n\n1042.  Approximately one week after this incident, K.R. 2 was sent to the medical unit for \n0 a discharge checkup. K.R. 2 Abuser 1 again ordered him to undress and lay down, then masturbated \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 K.R. 2 for 60 to 90 seconds in a similar manner as the previous incident, then continued with the \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    rest of the physical. When he finished the physical, K.R. 2 Abuser 1 escorted K.R. 2 out of the \nA\n1 \n4\n1: medical unit, at which point another youth passed by them in the hallway. K.R. 2 told this youth \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 that K.R. 2 Abuser 1 had just masturbated him and that he felt very uncomfortable with him. K.R. \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 2 Abuser 1 quickly pulled K.R. 2 back into the medical unit and once again said that the genital \nA\nD\nD \nE groping was “part of the procedure,” and said that he could get K.R. 2 in trouble for telling other \nL\nFI\nyouths about the incidents. \n1043.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1044.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff K.R. 2 was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n1045.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff K.R. 2, staff members \n0 were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \nA\n1 \n4\n1: arising therefrom.  \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1047.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nA\nD\nD \nE Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nL\nFI\nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of D.C. 3  \n1048.  When Plaintiff D.C. 3 was 14 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members \n(hereinafter “D.C. 3 Abuser 1” and “D.C. 3 Abuser 2” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in \nthe course and scope of their employment and under the control of Cook County and/or the State \nof Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused \nD.C. 3 between 2012 and 2014. \n1049.  D.C. 3 Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a heavy-set white male estimated to be in \nhis 30s and approximately 5’11 in height. He had brown hair and was balding. \n1050.  D.C. 3 Abuser 2 was at all relevant times a muscular black male estimated to be in \nhis mid 30s and approximately 6’2 in height. He was bald and had tribal-style tattoos on one arm. \nHe was a “rover,” or a patrolling staff member. \n1051.  D.C. 3 expects to learn the full names and identities of his abusers through the \ncourse of discovery. \n  290 \n\n1052.  D.C.  3 Abuser  1  was  an  intake  officer  at  JTDC  and  strip-searched  D.C.  3 \n0 approximately three to four times whenever he entered or re-entered the facility between 2012 and \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 2014. During these intake strip searches, D.C. 3 Abuser 1 ordered D.C. 3 to undress, patted down \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    his naked body, grabbed and fondled his genitals for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, and made sexual \nA\n1 \n4\n1: comments about his body and genitals. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1053.  These  strip  searches  were  conducted  upon  D.C.  3  without  individualized, \n2\n7/\nE: \nT reasonable suspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the \nA\nD\nD \nE United States and the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \nL\nFI\n1054.  During one of his stays in 2012 or 2013, D.C. 3 Abuser 2 grabbed and restrained \nD.C. 3 after he had gotten in a fight with other youths. D.C. 3 Abuser 2 dragged D.C. 3 back to his \ncell, forcefully undressed him, and locked him inside his cell. After approximately three or four \nhours, D.C. 3 Abuser 2 returned to the cell and quickly approached D.C. 3, grabbed his genitals \nand buttocks, and began to masturbate him. He then attempted to digitally penetrate D.C. 3, at \nwhich point D.C. 3 pulled away and said that he was uncomfortable and upset. D.C. 3 Abuser 2 \nreached towards D.C. 3’s genitals and attempted to continue masturbating him, but D.C. 3 pulled \naway and loudly told him to stop, at which point D.C. 3 Abuser 2 exited the cell. D.C. 3 was \ndischarged from the facility two days after this incident, and he did not see D.C. 3 Abuser 2 again. \n1055.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  291 \n\n1056.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff D.C. 3 was a minor in the legal and physical \n0 custody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1057.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n2\n7/\nE: \nT breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nA\nD\nD \nE abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nL\nFI\nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n1058.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.C., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1059.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of C.C.  \n1060.

He had a fade haircut and slight \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 facial hair. C.C. expects to learn the full name and identity of his abuser through the course of \n2\n7/\nE: \nT discovery. \nA\nD\nD \nE 1062.  C.C. stayed at JTDC from July 2 to July 5 of 2014 or 2015. On the morning of July \nL\nFI\n3, C.C. Abuser 1 approached C.C. in his cell and asked if he wanted to take an early shower. He \nagreed and C.C. Abuser 1 escorted him to the bathroom. When C.C. entered the shower area, C.C. \nAbuser 1 followed him in and offered extra food and cigarettes in exchange for sexual favors. He \nalso said that he would “punish” him by extending his stay at the facility and threatened him with \na physical beating if he refused the abuse. C.C. Abuser 1 coerced him into receiving oral copulation \ninside the shower. After the abuse, C.C. Abuser 1 again said that he would physically beat him if \nanyone found out about the abuse, then escorted him back to his cell. One day later on July 4, C.C. \nand another youth were getting ready to shower when C.C. Abuser 1 entered the bathroom and \nordered the other youth to leave the bathroom so he could be alone with C.C. The other youth \nrefused, and when two other staff members approached the bathroom, C.C. Abuser 1 quickly left \nthe area. C.C. was discharged from the facility a day later and did not see C.C. Abuser 1 again. \n1063.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  293 \n\n1064.

Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \n2\n7/\nE: \nT various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \nA\nD\nD \nE warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \nL\nFI\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \nand to protect the Plaintiff.  \n1066.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff C.C., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1067.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of D.E. 2  \n1068.  When Plaintiff D.E. 2 was 14 years old and under house arrest, a parole officer \nnamed Ms. Kathy, while acting in the course and scope of her employment and under the control \n  294 \n\nof Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \n0 of Cook County, sexually abused D.E. 2 from 2011 to 2015. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1069.  Kathy was at all relevant times a slightly heavy-set blonde white female, estimated \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    to be in her 30s and approximately 5’8 in height. D.E. 2 expects to learn the full name and identity \nA\n1 \n4\n1: of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1070.  In 2011 when D.E. 2 was 14 years old, he was placed on house arrest and assigned \n2\n7/\nE: \nT Kathy as a parole officer. Over the course of his two months of house arrest, Kathy visited D.E. 2 \nA\nD\nD \nE at his home and his school, even when she was not required to for the program, approximately \nL\nFI\nthree to five times a week. She regularly groped D.E. 2’s genitals and buttocks, both over and \nunder the clothes, every time she saw him. On one occasion, she masturbated him inside of his \nhome.  \n1071.  She gave him many gifts throughout his house arrest, including new shoes, athletic \nclothes, and $500 in cash. Even when D.E’s house arrest period ended, Kathy continued to see him \nweekly at his home and school, and she groped him over and under the clothes during every visit. \nShe visited him all throughout high school, starting from his freshman year and continuing to his \nsenior year in 2015 at the age of 17. \n1072.   Throughout the period of abuse, Kathy frequently told D.E. 2 that he could not tell \nanyone about the sexual abuse or else she would stop giving him gifts. D.E. 2 went to college in \nanother state after high school, and Kathy was unable to continue sexually abusing him. \n1073.

P.G. \nAbuser 1 then fondled P.G.’s genitals and buttocks for an extended period, rubbed his finger against \nhis anus, and digitally penetrated him for several minutes while the group of staff members laughed \nand made sexual comments. P.G. Abuser 1 then brought P.G. to the bathroom and ordered him to \nshower while he and two other staff members watched and made sexual comments. P.G. Abuser 1 \nthreatened to send P.G. to confinement if he refused the strip search or shower. P.G. did not interact \nwith P.G. Abuser 1 after his initial intake. \n1124.  These strip searches were conducted upon P.G. without individualized, reasonable \nsuspicion, nor compliance with the constitutions, laws, and regulations of both the United States \nand the State of Illinois. These searches were a pretext for sexual abuse.  \n1125.  Within the first month of his stay at JTDC, P.G. Abuser 2 approached P.G. in his \ncell and asked to watch him while he showered or used the bathroom. He said that he would reward \nP.G. with video games, extra snacks, and commissary priority if he complied. P.G. capitulated with \n  306 \n\nthis coercion, and from this point forward P.G. Abuser 2 regularly entered the bathroom while P.G. \n0 showered and masturbated himself. P.G. Abuser 2 sexually abused P.G. in this manner twice a \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 week for approximately one year.

Starting approximately halfway through T.C.’s stay at JTDC, Peachtree regularly \napproached T.C. on his housing unit and made friendly conversation with him about his home life \n  308 \n\nand interests. Eventually she started to take him out of class and let him out during lockup so they \n0 could sit and talk, during which time she groped his genitals and buttocks over the clothes while \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 asking explicit questions about his sexuality and sexual interests. After a few months of this \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    behavior, she began groping him over and under the clothes multiple times a week.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1136.  On one occasion, she ordered T.C. to enter a nearby classroom, which was empty \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 since it was a weekend. She then had sexual intercourse with him inside the classroom.  \n2\n7/\nE: \nT 1137.  One to two months later, she approached him in the evening and told him to go to \nA\nD\nD \nE the bathroom before nightly head count. T.C. complied, and Peachtree entered the bathroom after \nL\nFI\nthe other youths were locked down and had sexual intercourse with him.  \n1138.  Throughout the period of abuse, Peachtree gave T.C. outside food, extra snacks, \nbetter chores cleaning around the facility, and extra time outside of his cell or the classroom as a \nreward for complying with the abuse. She also kept him at a higher level on the facility’s behavioral \nchart system, which allowed him additional privileges within JTDC. Peachtree regularly said how \nthey would both get in trouble and his sentence would be extended if he ever disclosed the abuse.  \n1139.  On several occasions, a staff member named Nickerson told T.C. that he heard \nabout his sexual relationship with Peachtree and made sexual jokes about the abuse.  \n1140.  T.C. Abuser 1 often said that she wanted to continue their sexual relationship once \nhe left the facility. \n1141.  Starting within the first month or two of T.C.’s stay at JTDC, Stewart approached \nT.C. and offered him a spot in his after-hours card games, where Stewart invited several different \npods to play cards with him and other staff members in the evenings. When T.C. attended these \ncard games, Stewart groped and caressed him over the clothes on his shoulders, neck, back, arms, \nand buttocks and made sexual jokes towards T.C. \n  309 \n\n1142.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \n0 were non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 and Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1143.

At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff T.C., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1146.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n  310 \n\nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \n0 employees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 Sexual Abuse of M.R.  \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1147.

Abuser 1 visited him late \nat night and threatened to falsely write him up and extend his stay at JTDC unless he gave him \nsexual favors. He capitulated with this coercion, and M.R. Abuser 1 forced M.R. to masturbate \nhim. M.R. Abuser 1 sexually abused M.R. four to five more times after this incident across multiple \nstays in 2007 and 2008, during which times he entered M.R.’s cell late at night and forcibly \nmasturbated him. On two occasions he forcibly administered oral copulation on the Plaintiff. \nDuring the first two incidents of sexual abuse, M.R. Abuser 1 physically forced M.R. into \ncomplying.

Abuser 2 entered his \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    cell, masturbated him, and administered oral copulation on him. She sexually abused M.R. in this \nA\n1 \n4\n1: manner one more time after this incident. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1152.  Sometime during one of his stays in 2008, M.R. verbally reported the sexual abuse \n2\n7/\nE: \nT of M.R. Abusers 1 and 2 to a “white shirt” authority figure. This white shirt told M.R. that he \nA\nD\nD \nE would look into the incidents, but he nor anyone else ever followed up with M.R. regarding his \nL\nFI\nreport. \n1153.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1154.

Johnson sexually \nL\nFI\nabused D.D. 3 in this manner on a near-daily basis across several stays at the facility. \n1533.  On one occasion, D.D. 3 reported the above incidents of sexual abuse to a visiting \nsexual  abuse  counselor.  The  counselor  said  that  the  sexual  abuse  was  “unacceptable”  and \ntransferred her to an off-grounds safehouse to protect her from further sexual abuse.

During his second stay at JTDC in 2012 when he was 16 years old, J.T. 2 Abuser 3 \nstopped by J.T. 2’s cell during the nightly head count and ordered him to expose his genitals to \nher. He refused, and she told him not to tell anybody about the incident then walked away. \n1546.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n  385 \n\n1547.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff J.T. 2 was a minor in the legal and physical \n0 custody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 sexual abuse and/or acts. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1548.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nA\n1 \n4\n1: that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n2\n7/\nE: \nT breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nA\nD\nD \nE abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \nL\nFI\nmechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \nreport the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n1549.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff J.T. 2, staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1550.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of D.J. 3  \n1551.  When Plaintiff D.J. 3 was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, a “rover” staff member \n(hereinafter “D.J. 3 Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope of \n  386 \n\nhis employment and under the control of Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office \n0 of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused D.J. 3 in 2010. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1552.  D.J. 3 Abuser 1 was at all relevant times a light-skinned, heavy-set black male \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    estimated to be in his mid 30s. He had a “buzz cut” and a goatee-mustache. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1553.  A few months into D.J. 3’s stay at JTDC, D.J. 3 Abuser 1 approached D.J. 3 as he \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 showered and ordered him to go back to his cell. D.J. 3 was confused and did not immediately \n2\n7/\nE: \nT comply, causing D.J. 3 Abuser 1 to grab D.J. 3 forcefully by his bare genitals with an ungloved \nA\nD\nD \nE hand, hard enough to cause pain, and ordered him again to go back to his cell. Due to D.J. 3 Abuser \nL\nFI\n1’s physical and sexual intimidation, D.J. 3 capitulated and allowed D.J. 3 Abuser 1 to escort him \nback to his cell. Shortly after this incident, D.J. 3 verbally reported the incident to several other \nstaff members, but they said that the incident wasn’t a “big deal” and refused to take his report. \n1554.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1555.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff D.J. 3 was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n1556.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \nwarn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n  387 \n\nreporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n0 and to protect the Plaintiff.  \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1557.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff D.J. 3, staff members \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \n2\n7/\nE: \nT arising therefrom.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 1558.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nL\nFI\nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of J.L.  \n1559.  When Plaintiff J.L. was 15 years old and housed at JTDC, two staff members named \nMr. Servitel and Mr. Downey, while acting in the course and scope of their employment and under \nthe control of Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the \nCircuit Court of Cook County, sexually abused J.L. in 2009 or 2010. \n1560.  Mr. Servitel was at all relevant times a slim black male estimated to be in his late \n20s to early 30s and approximately 6’2 in height. \n1561.  Mr. Downey was at all relevant times a black male estimated to be in his mid 30s. \nHe was of stocky build with a “beer belly,” was balding with a fade haircut, and had slight facial \nhair. \n  388 \n\n1562.  J.L. expects to learn the full names and identities of her abusers through the course \n0 of discovery. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1563.  Servitel and Downey worked visitation and handcuffed and escorted J.L. to and \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    from the visitation area on Wednesdays and Sundays. Servitel made frequent sexual gestures at \nA\n1 \n4\n1: J.L. and regularly asked to “taste” J.L. and receive sexual favors in exchange for special privileges. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Whenever Servitel handcuffed J.L., he rubbed his genitals on her behind and groped her breasts \n2\n7/\nE: \nT and buttocks over the clothes. He gave J.L. coupons as a reward for complying with the abuse.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 1564.  Downey made frequent sexual jokes towards J.L. and regularly said that he wanted \nL\nFI\nto have sex with her once she was released from JTDC. Whenever he handcuffed J.L., he rubbed \nhis genitals on her buttocks similar to Servitel. On one occasion, Downey physically forced J.L. to \nbend over while she was handcuffed and forcefully thrusted himself against her behind, which \npushed J.L. forward and caused her to hit her head on the nearby locker. Downey told J.L. that she \ncould not tell anybody about this incident or else he would extend her sentence and prevent her \nfrom taking visitation for the rest of her stay. \n1565.  Servitel  and  Downey  sexually  abused  J.L.  in  this  manner  twice  a  week  for \napproximately seven months until two new staff members took over visitation and the abuse ended. \n1566.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by these staff members \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1567.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff J.L. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n  389 \n\n1568.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \n0 that these staff members were sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 occurred, and they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    breached various duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the \nA\n1 \n4\n1: abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to \n2\n7/\nE: \nT report the abuse, and to protect the Plaintiff.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 1569.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff J.L., staff members \nL\nFI\nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \nbelief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nstaff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \narising therefrom.  \n1570.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abusers’  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of C.D.  \n1571.  When Plaintiff C.D. was 14 to 16 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff member \nnamed Eric Poole, while acting in the course and scope of his employment and under the control \nof Cook County and/or the State of Illinois vis a vis Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \nof Cook County, sexually abused C.D. from 2008 to 2010. \n  390 \n\n1572.  Eric Poole was at all relevant times a heavy-set black male estimated to be in his \n0 late 20s to early 30s, and of short height. He had a short haircut. \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 1573.  Between 2008 and 2010, Poole regularly approached C.D.’s cell in the evenings \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    and exposed his genitals, pushed his bare genitals through the cell door for her to see, and made \nA\n1 \n4\n1: explicit and demeaning sexual comments towards her. He occasionally groped her breasts through \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 the cell door. Poole sexually abused C.D. in this manner on a near-daily basis over the course of \n2\n7/\nE: \nT three years. He regularly gave her commissary money as a reward for enduring the abuse.  \nA\nD\nD \nE 1574.  At one point shortly after C.D. was released from JTDC, Poole added her on \nL\nFI\nMyspace, where he messaged her explicit sexual comments and asked her to meet up with him so \nhe could further sexually abuse her. C.D. refused to meet up with Poole.  \n1575.  On one occasion, C.D. verbally reported Poole’s sexually abusive behavior to a \nsupervisor named Ms. Parker. Parker told her to “shut the fuck up” and refused to take her report. \nNo one else followed up with C.D. regarding her report. \n1576.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nwere non-consensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand Childhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and \n720 ILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of employment at the JTDC.  \n1577.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff C.D. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of JTDC and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-described \nsexual abuse and/or acts. \n1578.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \n  391 \n\nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including but not limited to their duty to prevent the abuse, to \n0 warn Plaintiffs of known perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 reporting the abuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    and to protect the Plaintiff.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1579.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff C.D., staff members \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 were not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n2\n7/\nE: \nT belief, Cook County’s failure to supervise, discipline, train, remove, and/or otherwise investigate \nA\nD\nD \nE staff members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries \nL\nFI\narising therefrom.  \n1580.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nomissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \nChildhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \nthe knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nemployees, agents, or servants to report and prevent said abuse of the Plaintiff.  \nSexual Abuse of M.S. \n \n1581.  When Plaintiff M.S. was 14 years old and housed at JTDC, a staff member \n(hereinafter “M.S. Abuser 1” unless otherwise indicated), while acting in the course and scope of \nhis employment and under the control of Cook County, sexually abused D.S. in 2006. \n1582.  M.S. Abuser  1  was  at  all  relevant  times  a  slim  black  male  estimated  to  be \napproximately 6’2 in height and in his mid 20s to mid 30s. M.S. expects to learn the full name and \nidentity of his abuser through the course of discovery. \n1583.  Approximately one week into his stay at JTDC, M.S. was by himself in the \nbathroom during the evening when M.S. Abuser 1 entered the bathroom and exposed his genitals \n  392 \n\nto M.S.  Then, he ordered M.S. to masturbate him under the threat of an extended sentence. M.S. \n0 refused, so M.S. Abuser 1 physically forced M.S. to masturbate him. M.S. Abuser 1 forcibly \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 masturbated M.S. and digitally penetrated him. After the abuse, M.S. Abuser 1 ordered M.S. to go \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    back to his cell and threatened to write him up and extend his sentence if he ever disclosed the \nA\n1 \n4\n1: abuse. A few days later, M.S. Abuser 1 sexually abused M.S. again in this same manner. M.S. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Abuser 1 gave M.S. extra snacks as a reward for complying with the abuse. Approximately two \n2\n7/\nE: \nT weeks after the abuse started, M.S. left JTDC and did not see M.S. Abuser 1 again. \nA\nD\nD \nE 1584.  The above-described sexual abuse and/or acts perpetrated by this staff member \nL\nFI\nwere nonconsensual and constitute assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nChildhood Sexual Abuse as defined in Illinois Compiled Statutes 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 and 720 \nILCS 5/11-0.1 and occurred in the course and scope of their employment at the JTDC.  \n1585.  At the relevant times herein, Plaintiff M.S. was a minor in the legal and physical \ncustody of Cook County and did not factually consent and could not legally consent to the above-\ndescribed sexual abuse and/or acts. \n1586.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and servants knew or should have known \nthat this staff member was sexually abusing children at JTDC before and after the abuse occurred, \nand they knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly, recklessly, and/or negligently breached \nvarious duties owed to Plaintiff, including their duty to prevent the abuse, to warn Plaintiffs of \nknown perpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the \nabuse, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect \nthe Plaintiff.  \n1587.  At the time of the above-described sexual abuse of Plaintiff M.S., staff members \nwere not adequately supervised, monitored, or surveilled by Cook County. Upon information and \n  393 \n\nbelief, Defendant’s failure to supervise, discipline, remove, and/or otherwise investigate staff \n0 members directly enabled in whole or in part the above-described sexual abuse and injuries arising \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 therefrom. \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    1588.  Cook County is vicariously liable in whole or in part for all wrongful acts and \nA\n1 \n4\n1: omissions  set  forth  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  both  the  abuser’s  acts  constituting \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 Childhood Sexual Abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and battery, and for \n2\n7/\nE: \nT the knowing, intentional, willful, wanton, reckless, and/or negligent failure of Cook County \nA\nD\nD \nE employees,  agents,  or  servants  to  prevent  the  abuse,  to  warn  Plaintiffs  of  known  sexual \nL\nFI\nperpetrators, to advise Plaintiffs of internal and external mechanisms for reporting the abuse, to \nmake timely and reasonable efforts to stop the abuse, to report the abuse, and to protect the \nPlaintiff. \n \nDELAYED DISCOVERY - COMMON LAW AND 735 ILCS 5/13-202.2 \n \n1589.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count. \n1590.  In addition, or in the alternative, Plaintiffs state that some or all of them, as a result \nof the repressed memories, passage of time and/or counseling received, learned that they suffered \nthe injuries described herein as a direct and proximate cause of the sexual abuse committed by \nwhen they were a minor housed at JTDC, as stated more fully herein. \n1591.  One or more Plaintiffs had not discovered, understood or appreciated that any \nproblems they were experiencing (i.e., emotional, psychiatric, psychological, and sexual) were \ncaused by the Childhood Sexual Abuse described more fully herein. \n1592.  One or more Plaintiffs were unaware of the wrongful conduct of Defendant and its’ \nefforts to conceal their Childhood Sexual Abuse. \n  394 \n\n1593.  Plaintiffs had not discovered, understood or appreciated that any problems they \n0 were experiencing (i.e., emotional, psychiatric, psychological, and sexual) were caused in whole \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 or in part by the failure of Defendant to prevent, report and protect them from the Childhood Sexual \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    Abuse, as described more fully herein. \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1594.  Plaintiffs plead in addition to or in the alternative to the matters set forth herein, \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 delayed discovery of the harm and delay in learning of misconduct by Defendant and thus delay \n2\n7/\nE: \nT in the accrual of their claims against Defendant. \nA\nD\nD \nE CAUSES OF ACTION \nL\nFI\nCOUNT I – Negligence/Negligence per se \n \n1595.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every previous allegation \nabove as if fully stated in this Count.  \n1596.  Cook County, as well as its employees, agents, and officers, were required by law \nto take or otherwise voluntarily took the custody of minors, including Plaintiffs herein, within its \njurisdiction such as to deprive them of their normal opportunities for protection. The Plaintiffs and \nCook County, and its employees and agents stood in such a special relationship to one another that \nthe law imposes on the State an obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the Plaintiffs, \nincluding but not limited to an affirmative duty to aid and/or protect against and prevent an \nunreasonable risk of physical harm from third parties, including its own agents or employees.  \n1597.  As such, Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees, owed various duties \nto those juveniles, including Plaintiffs, in its custody. They include, but are not limited to: (1) a \nduty to provide individualized assessments to rehabilitate and prevent further delinquent behavior \nthrough the development of educational, vocational, social, emotional and basic life skills which \nenable youth to grow and mature; (2) a duty to secure care and guidance as will serve the safety \n  395 \n\nand moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the minor; (3) a duty to control the \n0 individuals who are the source of the sexual abuse alleged herein; (4) a duty to provide the minor \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 with food, shelter, education, and medical care; (5) a duty to not permit an act of sexual abuse \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    when the person has knowledge of sexual abuse; (6) a duty, when having reason to believe that \nA\n1 \n4\n1: sexual abuse has or will occur, to make timely and reasonable efforts to stop the sexual abuse by \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 reporting the sexual abuse, or causing a report to be made, to medical or law enforcement \n2\n7/\nE: \nT authorities and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services; (7) a duty to act as a \nA\nD\nD \nE reasonable, prudent State of Illinois employee, agent, or officer would act under the circumstances \nL\nFI\nto ensure the prevention and reporting of sexual abuse; (8) a duty to provide confined youth with \nmultiple avenues to report sexual abuse, including an avenue outside the facility, so that even if \nthe abuser is someone directly supervising that inmate or higher up in the authority chain, or a staff \nperson or inmate who might retaliate against that inmate, the victim still has a safe way to report \nthe abuse, thus ensuring both increased reporting, deterrence, and prevention of abuse; (9) a duty \nto provide confined youth with access to emotional support services from outside the facility to \nhelp confined youth heal from trauma; (10) a duty to protect them against an unreasonable risk of \nphysical and/or psychological harm, including sexual abuse; (11) a duty to protect children; (12) a \nduty to rehabilitate youth through developing the competencies of the youth in its care, including \nbut not limited to the enhancement and development of educational, vocational, social, emotional, \nand basic life skills; (13) a duty to actively participate in the continuity of care of the juvenile \njustice system; (14) a duty to actively engage in positive youth development; (15) a duty to secure \nfor each minor in its custody such care and guidance as will serve the safety and moral, emotional, \nmental, and physical welfare of the minor and the best interests of the community; and (16) a duty \nto preserve and strengthen the minor’s family ties whenever possible. \n  396 \n\n1598.  These duties are non-exhaustive and non-delegable. Given the special relationship \n0 of custodian and ward between Cook County and Plaintiffs herein, Cook County is directly liable \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 and vicariously liable in whole or in part for the acts, omissions, and tortious conduct, whether \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    negligent and/or intentional, of its employees and agents.  \nA\n1 \n4\n1: 1599.  Sexual abuse of children at JTDC was persistent and prevalent, and the nature of \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 their confinement and seclusion from family, as well as prior reports of abuse, rendered the risk of \n2\n7/\nE: \nT sexual abuse to be foreseeable and imminent. Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees \nA\nD\nD \nE knew or should have known that it had numerous agents, officers, and employees who sexually \nL\nFI\nabused children at JTDC.  \n1600.  Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees breached each of the foregoing \nduties, among others. \n1601.  In so doing, Cook County and its officers, agents, and employees violated one or \nmore statutes or ordinances that provide for a punishment and caused the kind of harm the statutes \nor ordinances were intended to prevent. The Plaintiffs were a member of the class the statutes or \nordinances were intended to protect.  \n1602.  Cook County failed to use ordinary care in determining whether JTDC was safe \nand/or  determining  whether  it  had  sufficient  information  to  represent  their  facilities  and/or \nprograms as safe. Cook County’s breach of various duties include, but are not limited to: failure \nto protect Plaintiffs from a known/suspected danger, failure to supervise staff members and \nPlaintiffs, failure to implement minimally sufficient policies and procedures in place to prevent \nsex abuse, failure to take reasonable measures to ensure that policies and procedures to prevent \nsex abuse were working, failure to adequately inform children of the risks of staff-on-resident sex \nabuse, failure to investigate and report risks of staff-on-resident sex abuse, failure to properly train \n  397 \n\nthe staff at the facilities and/or programs, failure to train children about the dangers of sex abuse \n0 by facility staff, failure to have an outside agency test their safety procedures, failure to protect the \n8\n0\n8\n0\nL0 children in its facilities and/or programs from sex abuse, failure to adhere to the applicable standard \n4\n2\n0\n2\nM    of care for resident safety, failure to control and prevent its employees, officers, and agents from \nA\n1 \n4\n1: committing sexual abuse. \n1\n4 \n2\n0\n2/2 1603.  Upon information and belief, Cook County, its employees, agents, and officers, \n2\n7/\nE: \nT additionally violated their legal duty by failing to report and/or prevent known and/or suspected \nA\nD\nD \nE sexual abuse of children by Plaintiffs’ abusers and/or their other agents to law enforcement. \nL\nFI\n1604.  Cook County and its employees, agents, and officers created a foreseeable risk of \nharm to Plaintiffs. As vulnerable children placed and participating in the facilities and/or programs \nCook  County  offered  that  were  overseen  by  poorly  trained,  insufficiently  supervised,  and \ninadequately  vetted  officers  and  supervisory  staff,  Plaintiffs  were  foreseeable  victims. \nAdditionally, as vulnerable children whom Plaintiffs’ abusers had access to and full control of \nthrough Cook County’s facilities and/or programs, Plaintiffs were foreseeable victims. Moreover, \nCook  County  implemented  an  unconstitutional  policy  of  strip-searching  children  without  a \nparticularized suspicion, which provided a false pretext for sexual abuse. \n1605.  As a direct and proximate result of the above-described conduct, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, \ndiscomfort, physical manifestations of emotional distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, \ndisgrace, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, and the loss of normal life. They were prevented, \nand  will  continue  to  be  prevented,  from  performing  daily  activities  and  obtaining  the  full \nenjoyment of life. They have sustained, and will continue to sustain, loss of earnings and earning \n  398 \n\ncapacity.
