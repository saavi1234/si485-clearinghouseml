The court held a settlement conference in the three cases. The parties reached agreement in the Norbert and Poot cases on almost all terms.

If it does, then the parties will finalize and sign the agreement that day or the next, confer on the schedule for filing the motions for approval, and file a notice of settlement with their proposed schedule next week. For the Pierce case, the court set a further settlement conference for Thursday, September 17, 2020, at 1:00 p.m. (Not Reported). Settlement Conference set for 9/17/2020 at 1:00 PM.

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns allegations by pretrial detainees of insufficient access to sunlight, fresh air, and recreation time, as well as being subjected to illegal strip searches.</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, 2019, the Plaintiff, a pretrial detainee, filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated inmates in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the County of San Francisco (&ldquo;County&rdquo;), as well as named and unnamed officials and employees of the San Francisco Sheriff&rsquo;s Department (&ldquo;SFSD&rdquo;).&nbsp; Represented by private counsel, Plaintiff sued under 42 USC &sect; 1983 based on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process protections. The Plaintiff also brought claims under state law.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the complaint alleged that the county had a policy whereby female deputies at a County Jail conducted random, unnecessary, and unjustified visual body cavity searches of pretrial and convicted female inmates in the presence and direct view of male deputies, and subsequently searched and destroyed their property. It also alleged that, at another County Jail, pretrial and post-conviction inmates were denied any opportunity for fresh air or time outside for exercise or recreation. Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorney&rsquo;s fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White.</p>\r\n<p>On April 3, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 1, 2020, Plaintiff, along with three others, filed an amended complaint. The parties engaged in settlement negotiations, but these were ultimately unsuccessful. On October 9, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint. This motion was denied by Judge White on January 14, 2021. Specifically, Judge White found that Plaintiffs could allege that systemic deprivation of outdoor time and cross-gender viewing of unclothed body cavity searches violated their constitutional rights, and that Plaintiffs had met their burden at this stage to overcome Defendants' qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>On November 5, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint named five individual plaintiffs (all current or former pretrial detainees) acting on behalf of the class, and reasserted the claims related to the denial of outdoor recreation time and cross-gender visual body cavity searches, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and state law.</p>\r\n<p>The parties subsequently filed a motion to sever the case into two sets of claims, one based on recreation time and the other on the searches. The court granted the motion on December 21, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed motions to certify a class for both sets of claims.</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2022, Defendants filed motions for summary judgment on both the search and recreation claims. Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment on the recreation claim.</p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2022, the court granted summary judgment for Defendants. 2022 WL 17418974. Regarding the outdoor recreation claim, the court found that the jail provided otherwise meaningful indoor exercise and recreation to its inmates, and thus did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court acknowledged that the facility did not provide outdoor recreation opportunities to pretrial detainees, but concluded that this alone did not amount to punishment. As for the cross-gender search claim, the court conceded that male deputies were sometimes in a position to have viewed the strip searches, but found that only infrequent or casual observance of the inmates was insufficient to constitute an infringement of the inmates&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court also denied the motions for class certification as moot.</p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2022, judgment was entered in favor of the Defendants, and the case was closed.&nbsp;</p>",

County of San Francisco, et al., 19-cv-\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  07659-JSW, which was filed in this District on November 20, 2019 (“Pierce”).  Plaintiffs oppose \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the administrative motion.  (Dkt. 143.)  The Plaintiff in Pierce also filed an opposition to \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants’ motion.  (Dkt. 144.)  Having evaluated the complaints and dockets in both matters, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the Court HEREBY DENIES the motion to relate, for the reasons set forth below. \n19  A.  Legal Standard. \n20  Civil Local Rule 3-12(a) dictates that the Court should relate cases where “the actions \n21  concern substantially the same parties, property, transaction or event” and “[i]t appears likely that \n22  there will be an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense or conflicting results if the \n23  cases are conducted before different Judges.” \n24  B.  Discussion. \n25  The two cases at issue here do not “concern substantially the same parties, property, \n26  transaction or event.”  Civ. L. Rule 3-12(a).  The Plaintiff in Pierce brings claims related both to \n27  the denial of out-of-cell time and outdoor recreation in San Francisco County Jail 2 (“County Jail \n28  2”) and to cross-gender visual body cavity searches in County Jail 2.  In contrast, Norbert \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 19     Filed 04/01/20     Page 2 of 2\n \n1  concerns only claims related to denial of out-of-cell time and outdoor recreation in San Francisco \n2  County Jails 4 and 5.  The Court finds that the unique cause of action related to body cavity \n3  searches in Pierce raises separate legal issues that will require factual development and analysis \n4  significantly different from that required in Norbert.   \n5  The Court further finds that the claims in Peirce related to denial of out-of-cell time and \n6  outdoor recreation are unsuited to resolution alongside the denial of out-of-cell time and outdoor \n7  recreation claims in Norbert.  Though the claims will turn on similar legal principles, the facts in \n8  the two cases are distinct.  The claims in Norbert pertain only to conditions in County Jails 4 and \n9  5, and the Court and parties have already invested significant time and resources developing the \n10  factual record in Norbert as to those facilities.  Because it was filed later, Pierce is in a different \n11  phase of litigation, and because it pertains to County Jail 2, a different facility entirely, the factual \n12  discovery in Norbert completed so far will not be relevant to the claims in Pierce. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Norbert has been significantly litigated; Pierce is still in the pre-discovery stage of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  litigation.  Given this difference in procedural posture as well as the differing facts and claims at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  issue, relating the two cases would be more burdensome than letting them proceed separately.  The \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Court therefore concludes that relation of the two cases would disserve judicial economy and \nS d nr\nee 17  impede the interests of justice in both matters.  Defendants’ motion to relate is DENIED. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n19  Dated: April 1, 2020 \n20  ______________________________ \nSALLIE KIM \n21 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n \n22 \n \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 ",

Good cause showing, plaintiffs: Defendant’s motion raises serious issues \n23 \nthat require extensive research. Siegel, Yee, Brunner & Mehta represent individuals who \n24 \nare currently incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail and in homeless encampments that are \n25 \naffected by the covid-19 pandemic and require immediate attention. The firm’s office is \n26 \ncurrently closed, and its attorneys are working from home pursuant to the current \n27 \nshelter-in-place orders while trying to navigate the administrative processes to talk to \n28 \n \n \nPierce v.

Defendants’ Statement of good cause: On March 16, 2020, the Health \n4 \nOfficer of the City and County of San Francisco issued an order directing all individuals \n5 \nliving in the County to shelter at their place of residence except for certain essential \n6 \nservices.  On March 20, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newson issued Executive \n7 \nOrder N-33-20, imposing similar restrictions state-wide for an indefinite period of time.  \n8 \nOn March 31, 2020, the Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisc extended \n9 \nthe shelter in place order until May 3, 2020.  Violation of the Health Officer’s Shelter in \n10 \nPlace order is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.  California \n11 \nHealth and Safety Code § 120295 et seq.; Calif. Pen. C. §§ 69, 148(a)(1). San Francisco \n12 \nAdmin. C. § 7.17(b).  The City’s essential government workers, include the individual \n13 \ndefendants in this case, are working tirelessly to reduce the risks to the public of this \n14 \nunprecedented pandemic, including risks to the jail population. \n15 \n  In recognition of the Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco’s \n16 \norder, on March 16, 2020, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera directed the City \n17 \n18  Attorney’s Office to be staffed only with employees performing essential government \n19  services.  Some other employees were asked to work remotely to the extent possible, \n20  including counsel of record in this case.  While Defendants are making best efforts to \n21  work at the highest possible level in light of the current circumstances, telecommuting \n22  has introduced some novel limitations, including the lack of adequate paralegal and \n23 \nsecretarial support, and the inability to access files remotely.   \n24 \n/// \n25 \n/// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n///   \n28 \n               \n \n \nPierce v.

Re: Dkt. No. 45 \n10 \n \nCOUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, VICKI \n11 \nHENNESSEY, MICHELE FISHER, and \n \nDOES 1-50, \n12 \na \ntruo inro 13  Defendants. \nCfi  \n tla  \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Now before the Court is the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants City and County of San \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Francisco and Vicki Hennessy, Sheriff Paul Miyamoto, and Michelle Fisher (collectively \nS d nr “Defendants”).  Defendants move to dismiss all claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo 12(b)(6).  Having reviewed the pleadings and the record in this case, the Court DENIES \nN 18 \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss. \n19 \nBACKGROUND \n20 \n  Plaintiffs are former and current pretrial detainees at San Francisco Jail No. 2 operated by \n21 \nDefendants.  Plaintiffs allege that they have been deprived rights secured by the United States \n22 \nConstitution and state law based on their deprivation of outdoor recreation opportunities and for \n23 \nbeing regularly subjected to male deputies watching unclothed body cavity searches.   \n24 \n  Additional specific facts shall be addressed in the body of this order. \n25 \nANALYSIS \n26 \nA.  Legal Standard on Motion to Dismiss. \n27 \nA motion to dismiss is proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) where the \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 2 of 8\n \n1  pleadings fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  A court’s “inquiry is limited to \n2  the allegations in the complaint, which are accepted as true and construed in the light most \n3  favorable to the plaintiff.”  Lazy Y Ranch Ltd. v. Behrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008).  Even \n4  under the liberal pleading standard of Rule 8(a)(2), “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the \n5  ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a \n6  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \n7  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)).  \n8  Pursuant to Twombly, a plaintiff must not merely allege conduct that is conceivable but must \n9  instead allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  “A \n10  claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \n11  the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n12  556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).     \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  If the allegations are insufficient to state a claim, a court should grant leave to amend, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unless amendment would be futile.  See, e.g., Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc., 912 F.2d 291, 296 (9th \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Cir. 1990); Cook, Perkiss & Liehe, Inc. v. N. Cal. Collection Serv., Inc., 911 F.2d 242, 246-47 (9th \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Cir. 1990).  However, “[t]he district court’s discretion to deny leave to amend is … broad where \nS d nr\nee 17  plaintiff has previously amended the complaint.”  Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 373 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (9th Cir. 1990) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \n19  B.  Outdoor Recreation Claims. \n20  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants deny them and all prisoners in County Jail No. 2 access to \n21  outdoor recreation and direct sunlight based on the jail’s deliberate design and logistical \n22  limitations.  The Court finds that the right to some form of outdoor recreation for pretrial detainees \n23  and prisoners alike is clearly established.   \n24    The binding cases addressing the rights of prisoners to recreation and access to daylight \n25  support the contention that some sort of outdoor recreation is required.  See, e.g., Spain v. \n26  Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 199 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that “[t]here is substantial agreement \n27  among the cases in this area that some form of regular outdoor exercise is extremely important to \n28  the psychological and physical well being of the inmates.”); Toussaint v. Yockey, 722 F.2d 1490, \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 3 of 8\n \n1  1492 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding that under certain conditions, the deprivation of outdoor exercise to \n2  inmates raises serious constitutional issues); see also Allen v. Sakai, 48 F.3d 1082, 1084 (9th Cir. \n3  1994) (“After Spain and Toussaint, defendants cannot legitimately claim that their duty to provide \n4  regular outdoor exercise to [the plaintiff] was not clearly established.”).   \n5  It is clearly established that “[e]xercise is one of the basic human necessities protected by \n6  the Eighth Amendment . . . Moreover, the Fourteenth Amendment requires that pre-trial detainees \n7  not be denied adequate opportunities for exercise without legitimate governmental objective.”  \n8  Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1211-12 (9th Cir. 2008).  Furthermore, the lack of \n9  outdoor space in the facility may be solely a logistical problem, and, without more, the facility \n10  design “cannot justify serious civil rights violations such as the ‘deprivation of a basic human \n11  need.’”  Shorter v. Baca, 895 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Allen, 48 F.3d at 1185). \n12  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs may allege that their constitutional rights were \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  violated as a result of the systematic deprivation of outdoor recreation time. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  C.  Unclothed Body Cavity Searches Claims. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiffs also allege that their constitutional rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  have been violated as a result of being subjected to unclothed body cavity searches in view of \nS d nr\nee 17  male guards.  A court must examine any search to determine its reasonableness under the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  circumstances.  Cross-gender strip searches in the absence of an emergency may violate an \n19  inmate’s right under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches.  See Byrd \n20  v. Maricopa County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 629 F.3d 1135, 1146 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  The Court in \n21  Byrd reaffirmed its “longstanding recognition that ‘[t]he desire to shield one’s unclothed figure \n22  from [the] view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is impelled by \n23  elementary self-respect and personal dignity.”  Id. at 1141 (quoting York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, \n24  455 (9th Cir. 1963)).   \n25  Whether any particular set of circumstances makes a search reasonable under the \n26  Fourteenth Amendment requires a case-by-case factual analysis which balances “the need for the \n27  particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.”  Id. (citing Bell v. \n28  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).  The Court must balance and consider the following factors:  \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 4 of 8\n \n1  “(1) the scope of the particular intrusion, (2) the manner in which it is conducted, (3) the \n2  justification for initiating it, and (4) the place in which it is conducted.”  Id. (citations omitted).  \n3  Depending upon the circumstances and the specific facts of any particular search, the examining \n4  court may recognize “that not all strip search procedures will be reasonable; some could be \n5  excessive, vindictive, harassing, or unrelated to any legitimate penological interest.  Thus our task \n6  is to consider carefully the reasonableness of [the prison’s] strip search policies.”  Michenfelder v. \n7  Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988).   \n8  Here, Plaintiffs allege that on at least two occasions, they were subjected to unclothed \n9  body cavity searches while male sheriff’s deputies were permitted to watch, with one deputy \n10  commenting that he did not have a girlfriend and had found the plaintiffs attractive.  (See FAC ¶¶ \n11  26-29.)  Plaintiffs allege that they were in their pod at the time of the searches, and that they were \n12  forced to undress, squat, cough, and spread open their vaginas and anuses, and lift their breasts for \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  visual inspection.  (See id. at ¶¶ 26, 28.)  They allege the searches were conducted indiscriminately \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and occurred early in the morning and that they were woken up from sleep in order to be searched.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (See id.)  The allegations do not indicate there was any particular emergency or urgency \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  necessitating the searches.  These allegations further indicate that the male officers did not \nS d nr\nee 17  incidentally view the unclothed female inmates, but rather were watching for at least some time.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The reasonableness of the search must be determined by the case-by-case weighing and \n19  balancing of the facts.  However, as alleged, Plaintiffs have set out sufficient facts to make out a \n20  claim that the viewing of the unclothed cavity searches by male deputies may violate their \n21  constitutionally protected rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Accordingly, the Court finds \n22  that Plaintiffs may allege that their constitutional rights were violated as a result of the cross-\n23  gender viewing of unclothed body cavity searches. \n24  D.  Qualified Immunity. \n25  In their motion to dismiss, Defendants argue that the officers involved in the alleged  \n26  deprivations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are entitled to qualified immunity for their conduct.  \n27  Qualified immunity “shields an officer from suit when she makes a decision that, even if \n28  constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 5 of 8\n \n1  confronted.”  Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004).  A claim for qualified immunity \n2  requires the court to evaluate the defense using a two-step inquiry in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 \n3  (2001).  The first step is to determine whether, given the undisputed facts, the officers violated a \n4  constitutional right.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009).  Under the second step of \n5  Saucier, the issue is whether the allegedly violated constitutional rights was “clearly established” \n6  in the specific factual context confronting the officers.  See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.  “If an \n7  official could reasonably have believed her actions were legal in light of clearly established law \n8  and the information she possessed at the time, she is protected by qualified immunity.”  Franklin \n9  v. Fox, 312 F.3d 423, 437 (9th Cir. 2002).  Courts may choose which prong of this analysis to \n10  address first.  See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236-39.  Examining the second prong first may “expedite \n11  the resolution of the case” because the second prong may be decided as a matter of law.  Morales \n12  v. Fry, 873 F.3d 817, 822-23 (9th Cir. 2017).   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Court begins and ends its analysis with the second factor.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  A federal right is “clearly established” when, at the time of the official’s conduct, the law \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  was “sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would understand” that what he or she was \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  doing was unlawful.  District of Columbia v. Wesby, 138 S. Ct. 527, 589 (2018) (citations and \nS d nr\nee 17  quotations omitted).  For a right to be clearly established, the law must be “settled”—the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  constitutionality “beyond debate”—with a sufficiently clear foundation in “then-existing \n19  precedent.”  Id.; Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 228 (1991).  It is not enough that the right in \n20  question is “suggested” by precedent existing at the time of the official’s challenged conduct.  \n21  Wesby, 138 S. Ct. at 590.  Rather, a rule must be dictated by controlling authority or a “robust \n22  consensus of cases of persuasive authority.”  Id. at 589-90 (citations and quotations omitted).  The \n23  precedent must be sufficiently clear so that “every reasonable official would interpret it to \n24  establish the particular rule the plaintiff seeks to apply.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The Court must \n25  therefore ask whether every reasonable official in Defendants’ positions would have known that \n26  their specific actions were unconstitutional, given the particular facts that they faced and the \n27  “precedent on the books.”  Hamby v. Hammond, 821 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation and \n28  quotation omitted); see Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 309 (2015) (noting that the second-prong \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 6 of 8\n \n1  inquiry depends “very much on the facts of each case”).  The burden is on the party contesting \n2  qualified immunity to show that a law was clearly established at the time of an alleged violation.  \n3  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 197-98 (1984).   \n4    Because the Court has found that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts to state causes of \n5  action for violation of their constitutional rights to outdoor recreational opportunities and freedom \n6  from the non-emergent cross-gender cavity searches, the Court finds that, at the pleading stage, \n7  Plaintiffs have met their burden to present allegations that “state a claim for violation of clearly \n8  established law.”  Mitchell v. Forsyth¸ 472 US. 511, 526 (1985).  The Court finds that Defendants \n9  are not, at this procedural stage, entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.1 \n10  E.  Bane Act Claims. \n11  Defendants also contend that California Government Code section 844.6, which grants \n12  public entities immunity for injuries to prisoners, bars liability against the City for Plaintiffs’ Bane \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Act claims.  This provision applies equally to preconviction detainees as it does convicted \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  prisoners.  See Cal. Gov’t Code § 844; see also Sahley v. County of San Diego, 69 Cal. App. 3d \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  347, 349 (1977) (holding that “preconviction detainee awaiting trial” who has been “booked and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  arraigned” was considered a “’prisoner’ for purposes of governmental immunity”).   \nS d nr\nee 17  California Government Code section 820.6 provides that “[i]f a public employee acts in \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  good faith, without malice, and under the apparent authority of an enactment that is \n19  unconstitutional, invalid, or inapplicable, he is not liable for an injury caused thereby.”  Under this \n20  section, “‘good faith’ reflects a subjective intention to act under the authority of the governing \n21  enactment, and to enforce or comply with those rules.”  O’Toole v. Superior Court, 140 Cal. App. \n22  4th 488, 505 (2006).  Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs have not pled any facts to \n23 \n \n24 \n1 Defendants also argue that the Court should dismiss the claims against the individual defendants \nin their individual capacities.  However, a supervisor may be held liable where there is “a \n25 \nsufficient causal connection between the supervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional \nviolation.”  Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Starr v. Baca, \n26 \n652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Because Plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants had \nultimate responsibility for the policy and training in the County jails, they may seek to hold the \n27 \nindividuals accountable for the failure to train, supervise, and control their subordinates regarding \ncavity searches and for failure to provide outdoor recreation opportunities pursuant to the County \n28 \njails’ policy, custom, or practice. \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 7 of 8\n \n1  demonstrate malicious intent by the Defendants and because no constitutional violations occurred, \n2  they should be found immune from liability.   \n3    However, Plaintiffs do not allege that the conduct was taken in an effort to enforce a law or \n4  policy, but rather, allege that the conduct was a clear violation of well-established law.  The good \n5  faith immunity for carrying out a constitutional law or policy is not applicable under these \n6  circumstances. \n7    Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs may not proceed as potential class representatives \n8  because they failed to present their claims properly under the Claims Act.  In order to comply with \n9  the procedural requirements, a plaintiff in a potential class action must present a timely claim on \n10  behalf of the class that includes the name, address, and other specific information concerning the \n11  representative plaintiff and sufficient information to identify the class itself.  See City of San Jose \n12  v. Superior Court, 12 Cal. 3d 447, 452 (1974).  Plaintiffs are obligated to provide the descriptions \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  of injury or damage or loss so far as it may be known at the time of the presentation of the claim.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  See Blair v. Superior Court, 218 Cal. App. 3d 221, 224 (1990).  The policy underlying the claims \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  presentation requirements is to afford proper notice to public entities so as to permit early \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  investigation and evaluation of the claim without incurring the expense of litigation.  See San Jose, \nS d nr\nee 17  12 Cal. 3d at 452. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Here, it appears that Plaintiff Pierce filed multiple claims alleging that she was being \n19  deprived proper recreation opportunities.  Although she did not specify that the recreation should \n20  be made possible outdoors, the Court finds she provided multiple grievances giving the City \n21  sufficient notice that a reasonable investigation and evaluation of the claims could have been made \n22  without incurring the expense of litigation.  The Court also finds that the grievances were in \n23  substantial compliance with the requirements to proceed on behalf of a class.  See, e.g., Craft v. \n24  County of San Bernadino, 2006 WL 4941829, at *4-6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2006) (“The fact that \n25  class representatives Craft and Hardy did not file a California Tort Claim prior to filing of the \n26  instant lawsuit does not serve to foreclose their ability to pursue any of the state law claims \n27  pressed in their complaint as one of the class representatives did submit a class claim that was in \n28  substantial compliance with Government Code section 910.”).  California Government Code \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 56     Filed 01/14/21     Page 8 of 8\n \n1  section 910 does not require claimants to describe all indebtedness, obligation, injury, damage, or \n2  loss incurred.  Rather, claimants are obligated to provide descriptions of indebtedness, obligation, \n3  injury, damage, or loss so far as it may be known at the time of presentation of the claim.  See \n4  Blair v. Superior Court, 218 Cal. App. 3d 221, 224 (1990) (“As long as these general elements are \n5  present, it is not necessary that the claim comply with formal pleading standards.”).  The Court \n6  finds that the fifteen grievances filed by Plaintiff Pierce are sufficient to give notice of the claims \n7  presented here. \n8  CONCLUSION \n9    Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to dismiss. \n10   \n11  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n12  Dated:  January14, 2021 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  ______________________________________ \nCfi\n tla JEFFREY S.

On or about November 20, 2018, female deputies at the San Francisco County Jail \n24  #2 conducted an unnecessary and unjustified visual body cavity search of pretrial and convicted \n25  female inmates in the presence and direct view of at least three, and up to seven or more, male \n26  deputies. A similar, random, and unreasonable visual body cavity search of female inmates was \n27  conducted in front of male deputies about a month prior. Upon information and belief, these \n28  searches have occurred in D-Pod, B-Pod, and possibly E-Pod. Moreover, San Francisco County \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n1\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 2 of 16\n \n1  Jail #2 denies all pretrial and convicted inmates any opportunities for fresh air or time outside for \n2  exercise or recreation in violation of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations § 1065, and \n3  the inmates’ Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights, respectively. These inmates, some of \n4  whom are pretrial and have been incarcerated for as long as six or seven years, have never seen \n5  the sun or felt the wind’s breeze in the entire duration of their incarceration.  \n6  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7    2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n8  1343(a)(3)-(4) because it is being brought to obtain compensatory and punitive damages for the \n9  deprivations, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States that are \n10  secured by the United States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. This action \n11  is brought pursuant to the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n12  Constitution, and the laws and Constitution of the State of California.  \n13    3.  Plaintiff and all others similarly situated persons further invoke this Court’s \n14  supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), to hear and decide claims arising \n15  under state law.  \n16    4.  Venue is proper, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)-(2), because the County of \n17  San Francisco Defendants reside in this judicial district, and the events or omissions giving rise \n18  to Plaintiff’s claims occurred in this judicial district.  \n19  PARTIES AND PROCEDURE \n20    5.  Plaintiff Jillian Pierce is a citizen of the United States and a competent adult. \n21  Throughout her incarceration at San Francisco County Jail #2, Jillian Pierce was a pretrial \n22  inmate. \n23    6.  Defendant County of San Francisco (“County”) is a municipal corporation, duly \n24  organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is the employer of the \n25  individual County defendants, as well as certain, to-be-identified Doe Defendants. Under its \n26  authority, the County operates the County of San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“SFSD”). At \n27  all material times herein, the County was responsible for supervising, enacting, and enforcing the \n28  SFSD’s conduct, policies, and practices, was responsible for the absence of needed policies and \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n2\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 3 of 16\n \n1  practices, and was responsible for the hiring, retention, supervision, and training of employees \n2  and agents of the SFSD including such employees as Defendants, Chief Sheriff Vicki Hennessy \n3  (“Hennessy”), Chief Deputy Michele Fisher (“Fisher”), and the to-be-identified County \n4  employees – Does 1-50.  \n5    7.   At all material times herein, Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, and the to-be-\n6  identified County employees Does 1-50, in doing the acts or omissions hereinafter described, \n7  acted within the course and scope of their employment with Defendant County, by virtue of their \n8  employment with the SFSD, and acted under color of state law. Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, \n9  and the to-be-identified County employees Does 1-50 are sued in their individual capacities, \n10  including, where applicable, in their capacities as supervisors based on supervisory liability. At \n11  all material times, these individual Defendants held titles and participated generally as follows in \n12  this matter:  \n13      a.  Defendant Hennessy, at all relevant times mentioned herein, was employed by  \n14      Defendant County as the Sheriff, and was acting within the course and scope of  \n15      that employment at such times. She is being sued in her individual and official  \n16      capacity as the SFSD Sheriff. At all material times, Sheriff Hennessy was the  \n17      final policy making official for the SFSD, ultimately responsible for all policies,  \n18      procedures, supervision, and training of the SFSD.   \n19      b.  Defendant Fisher, at all relevant times mentioned herein, was employed by  \n20      Defendant County as a Chief Deputy, and was acting within the course and  \n21      scope of that employment at such times. She is being sued in her individual and  \n22      official capacity as a Chief Deputy. Upon information and belief, Defendant  \n23      Fisher supervised DOES 1-50, and was ultimately responsible for enforcing  \n24      policies, procedures, supervision, and the training of them.  \n25    8.  The true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or \n26  otherwise, of Defendants named herein as Does 1-50 are unknown to Plaintiff, who therefore \n27  sues said Defendants by said fictitious names. Plaintiff will amend this Complaint to show said \n28  Defendants’ true names and capacities when the same has been ascertained. Plaintiff is informed, \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n3\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 4 of 16\n \n1  believes, and thereon alleges that all Defendants sued herein as Does are in some manner \n2  responsible for the acts, omissions, and injuries alleged herein.  \n3    9.  Plaintiff alleges, on information and belief, that each of the Defendants sued \n4  herein was wrongfully, deliberately indifferently, negligently, and/or otherwise responsible in \n5  some manner for the events and happenings as hereinafter described, and proximately caused \n6  injuries and damages to Plaintiff. Further, certain Doe Defendants were at all material times \n7  responsible for the hiring, training, supervision, and discipline of other defendants, including \n8  both the individually named and Doe Defendants.  \n9    10.  Plaintiff is informed, believes, and thereon alleges that each of the Defendants \n10  was at all material times an agent, servant, employee, partner, joint venturer, co-conspirator, \n11  and/or alter ego of the remaining Defendants, and in doing the things hereinafter alleged, was \n12  acting within the course and scope of that relationship. Plaintiff is further informed, believes, and \n13  thereon alleges that each of the Defendants herein gave consent, aid, and assistance to each of the \n14  remaining Defendants, and ratified and/or authorized the acts or omissions of each Defendant as \n15  alleged herein, except as may hereinafter be otherwise, specifically alleged. At all material times, \n16  each Defendant was an integral participant, jointly and fundamentally engaged in constitutionally \n17  violative, unlawful, and/or tortious activity, resulting in the deprivation of Plaintiff’s \n18  constitutional rights and other actionable harm.  \n19     11.  The acts and omissions of all County Defendants were at all material times \n20  pursuant to the actual customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of County and/or the SFSD.   \n21    12.  At all material times, each Defendant acted under color of the laws, statutes, \n22  ordinances, and regulations of the State of California.   \n23    13.  Plaintiff presented a proper and timely tort claim to County pursuant to \n24  Government Code § 910 et seq., and this action, as it relates to the state law claims asserted \n25  against County, was thereafter timely filed within the applicable statutes of limitation.  \n26    14.  This Complaint may be pleaded in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 8(d)(2) of the \n27  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n28  // \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n4\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 5 of 16\n \n1  GENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n2    15.  On or about November 20, 2018 at approximately 7:30 AM, Doe female deputies \n3  ordered all female inmates in D-Pod, both pretrial and convicted, to wake up and congregate by \n4  the tables located on the lower level of the pod. The deputies then ordered the inmates, in groups \n5  of three, to enter into the three bathroom stalls located on the same level and remove their \n6  clothing, squat, cough, spread open their vaginas and anuses, and lift their breasts for visual \n7  inspection. At all times throughout the visual body cavity search, the bathroom stall doors \n8  remained open and were conducted in the presence and direct view of at least three, and possibly \n9  up to seven or more, Doe male deputies. The male deputies were situated throughout the pod, \n10  including the staircase and upper level, where they could see directly into the bathroom stalls, \n11  while they watched the searches take place. This search was random, unnecessary, unjustified \n12  and made pursuant to SFSD protocol, policy, custom, or practice.  \n13    16.  Following the search, the deputies instructed the inmates to go to the gym while \n14  the deputies searched the inmates’ beds and personal belongings, including privileged \n15  correspondence. The deputies destroyed and/or confiscated the inmates’ personal belongings, \n16  including face rags and other items purchased through commissary. Upon information and belief, \n17  the visual body cavity of female inmates and subsequent property search also occurred in B-Pod \n18  and/or E-Pod, in the presence and view of male deputies.  \n19    17.  Sometime in October 2018, about a month prior, a similar visual body cavity \n20  search occurred in D-Pod at approximately 7:30 AM. Like the November 20th search, Doe \n21  female deputies ordered the female inmates, in groups of three and in the open bathroom stalls, \n22  to remove their clothing, squat, cough, spread open their vaginas and anuses, and lift their breasts \n23  for visual inspection in the presence of Doe male deputies. The deputies then searched the \n24  inmates’ beds and personal belongings, destroying items including items purchased in \n25  commissary. Like the November 20th search, this search was conducted pursuant to SFSD \n26  protocol, policy, custom, or practice and was unnecessary and unjustified.  \n27    18.   After both body cavity searches, inmates filed grievances regarding the body \n28  cavity searches conducted in the presence of male deputies. Many, if not all, grievances were \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n5\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 6 of 16\n \n1  ignored and the inmates never received responses. At least three investigators, however, came to \n2  D-Pod as a result. Upon information and belief, one of the investigators was Jesse Huber. The \n3  investigators interviewed the female inmates but Plaintiff does not know what, if anything, came \n4  about following their investigations.   \n5    19.  Additionally, inmates at the San Francisco County Jail #2 submitted grievances \n6  for being denied exercise and recreation time in violation of Title 15 of the California Code of \n7  Regulations § 1065. These grievances were largely ignored. Upon information and belief, the \n8  SFSD has a policy, custom, or practice of knowingly violating section 1065. Deputy Parks, in \n9  fact, informed Plaintiff that the SFSD pays a fine every month for being in violation of section \n10  1065. As aforementioned, all inmates, pretrial and convicted, housed at San Francisco County \n11  Jail #2 are denied any opportunity for outdoor exercise or recreation. Some of these inmates have \n12  yet to be convicted and have been incarcerated for years without once being able to go outside \n13  and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. Plaintiff, in the entire duration of her incarceration, which \n14  lasted a little over one year, was denied any opportunity to be outside.  \n15    20.  At all material times and, alternatively, the actions and omissions of each \n16  Defendant were intentional, and/or wanton, and/or willful, and/or reckless, and/or callous, and/or \n17  malicious, and/or deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff’s rights, and/or grossly negligent, and/or \n18  negligent and/or pursuant to SFSD policies, customs, or practices. \n19    21.  Plaintiff and all others similarly situated persons have incurred, and continue to \n20  incur, constitutional, emotional, physical, and psychological harms and losses, as well as \n21  ongoing stress and anxiety, as a result of Defendants’ tortious, wrongful, and constitutionally \n22  violative conduct.  \n23    22.  As a direct and proximate result of each Defendants’ acts and/or omissions as set \n24  forth above, Plaintiff and all others similarly situated persons sustained, and are currently \n25  sustaining, the following injuries and damages, past and future, including, but not limited to: \n \n26 \n    a.  Economic damages, including, but not limited to, damages to personal   \n    belongings; \n27 \n \n28      b. Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, sleeplessness, humiliation, indignity, vitamin  \n    D deficiencies, and loss of liberty; \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n6\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 7 of 16\n \n \n1 \n    c.  Loss of enjoyment of life and other continued pain and suffering;  \n \n2 \n    d.  All other legally cognizable special and general damages; \n3   \n    e.  Violations of state and federal constitutional rights; and \n4 \n \n    f.  All damages and penalties recoverable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988,  \n5 \n    California Civil Code § 52, California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5, and as  \n6      otherwise allowed under California and United States statutes, codes, and   \n    common law.  \n7   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n8 \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n9 \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n10  PLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \nCOUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n11 \n  23.  Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons re-alleges and incorporates by reference \n12 \neach and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n13 \n  24.  By the actions and omissions described above, the Defendants named above in \n14 \nthis cause of action and Does 1-50, acting under the color of state law in their individual \n15 \ncapacities, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, depriving Plaintiff of the following well-settled \n16 \nconstitutional rights that are protected by the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n17 \nU.S. Constitution: \n18   \n    a.  The right to be free from unreasonable searches, entry and/or seizures, as  \n19 \n         secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and \n \n20 \n    b.  The right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, as secured by the  \n21           Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n \n22 \n  25.  The listed Defendants’ failure to intervene, prevent, or stop the constitutional \n23 \nviolations on the part of other, individually named Defendants and/or supervisors, who were in a \n24 \nposition to do so when such violations occurred, renders such Defendant(s) liable for these \n25 \nviolations.  \n26 \n  26.  Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, and the to-be-identified Doe Defendants’ \n27 \ndeliberately indifferent and constitutionally violative conduct in failing to take appropriate \n28 \nactions foreseeably set into motion the chain of events that proximately caused the subsequent \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n7\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 8 of 16\n \n1  unlawful search of Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons and their personal effects, and \n2  caused Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons to continuously be subjected to cruel and \n3  unusual punishment and other liberty deprivations.  \n4    27.  To the extent the supervisors of Does 1-50, who supervised them at material and \n5  relevant times, knew, should have known, or had reason to know of Defendants’ constitutionally \n6  violative conduct, as alleged above, or their propensity to engage in such conduct, such \n7  supervisors failed to prevent the unconstitutional acts of said Defendants and failed to properly \n8  supervise, thus rendering them liable both directly and in their capacity as supervisor. Thus, any \n9  supervisors that failed to prevent the unconstitutional acts of said Defendants and failed to \n10  properly supervise them are liable directly and in their capacity as a supervisor.  \n11    28.  The Defendants named in this cause of action subjected Plaintiff and all similarly \n12  situated persons to their wrongful conduct, depriving Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons \n13  of the rights described herein, knowingly, maliciously, and with conscious and reckless disregard \n14  for whether the rights and safety of Plaintiff would be violated by their acts and/or omissions.  \n15    29.  As a proximate result of the foregoing wrongful acts, Plaintiff and all similarly \n16  situated persons sustained injuries and damages, as set forth above, in ¶ 22. Plaintiff and all \n17  similarly situated persons are, therefore, entitled to general and compensatory damages in an \n18  amount to be proven at trial.  \n19    30.  In committing the acts alleged above, the individually named Defendants and Doe \n20  Defendants acted maliciously and/or were guilty of wanton and reckless disregard for the rights, \n21  safety, and emotional well-being of Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons, and by reason \n22  thereof, Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons are entitled to punitive damages and penalties \n23  allowable under 42. U.S.C. § 1983 and other state and federal law against these individual \n24  Defendants; no punitive damages are sought directly against County.  \n25    31.  Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable costs and attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § \n26  1988 and other applicable California codes and laws.  \n27  // \n28  // \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n8\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 9 of 16\n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n1 \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Monell and Supervisory Liability) \nPLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \n2 \nCOUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n3 \n  32.  Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons re-alleges and incorporates by reference \n4 \neach and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n5 \n  33.  As supervisors, Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50 each permitted and \n6 \nfailed to prevent the unconstitutional acts of other Defendants and individuals under their \n7 \nsupervision and control, and failed to properly supervise such individuals, with deliberate \n8 \nindifference to the rights of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons. Each of these \n9 \nsupervising Defendants either directed his or her subordinates in conduct that violated Plaintiff \n10 \nand all others similarly situated persons’ rights, OR set in motion a series of acts and omissions \n11 \nby his or her subordinates that the supervisor knew or reasonably should have known would \n12 \ndeprive Plaintiff and all others similarly situated persons of their rights, OR knew his or her \n13 \nsubordinates were engaging in acts likely to deprive Plaintiff and all other similarly situated \n14 \npersons of their rights and failed to act to prevent his or her subordinates from engaging in such \n15 \nconduct, OR disregarded the consequences of a known or obvious training deficiency that he or \n16 \nshe must have known would cause subordinates to violate Plaintiff and all other similarly \n17 \nsituated persons’ their rights, and in fact did cause the violation of Plaintiff and all other \n18 \nsimilarly situated persons’ rights. (See, Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instruction 9.4). \n19 \nFurthermore, each of these supervising Defendants is liable in their failures to intervene in their \n20 \nsubordinates’ apparent violations of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons’ rights.  \n21 \n  34.  Additionally, these supervisors disregarded the consequences of a policy \n22 \ndeficiency that they knew or had reason to know would proximately cause the violation of \n23 \nPlaintiff and all other similarly situated persons’ constitutional rights, which in fact did cause the \n24 \nviolation of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons’ rights.  \n25 \n  35.  Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons allege, upon information and \n26 \nbelief, that the unconstitutional actions and/or omissions of Hennessy, Fisher, and other, Doe \n27 \nDefendants herein were pursuant to the following customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures \n28 \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n9\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 10 of 16\n \n1  of County and/or SFSD, or stated in the alternative, which were directed, encouraged, allowed \n2  and/or ratified by policy making officials for County and/or SFSD including Does 1-50: \n \n3 \na. Failing to enact and/or maintain and/or execute policies and procedures \nand/or failing to train employees on body cavity searches of inmates \n4 \nwithout probable cause and/or justification for such searches and in the \n5  presence of opposite-sex deputies; and \n \n6 \nb. Failing to enact and/or maintain and/or execute policies and procedures \nand/or failing to train employees on inmates’ exercise and recreation, \n7 \nincluding, but not limited to, their constitutional right to not be deprived of \n8  fresh air and outdoor exercise or recreation. \n  36.  In the alternative, upon information and belief, Defendants may have instituted \n9 \npolicies or training addressing some or all of the topics listed above, but have, either through \n10 \nnegligence or deliberate indifference to citizens’ rights, failed to properly oversee, enforce, \n11 \nand/or properly carry out such policies and/or training.  \n12 \n  37.  The above-described customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of County, \n13 \nand/or SFSD were a moving force and/or a proximate cause of the deprivations of Plaintiff and \n14 \nall other similarly situated persons’ constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as \n15 \nmore fully set forth above.  \n16 \n  38.  Defendant County is also liable for the violations of Plaintiff’s rights by their final \n17 \npolicy makers, including Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50, as described above. (See, Ninth \n18 \nCircuit Model Civil Jury Instruction 9.6).  \n19 \n  39.  Upon information and belief, after receiving Plaintiff’s Government Code section \n20 \n910 claim, County conducted investigations and reviews of this matter concerning the wrongful \n21 \nsearch and other liberty deprivations of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons, and \n22 \nDefendants Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50 directly and personally participated in such \n23 \ninvestigations and reviews. The unconstitutional actions and/or omissions of the individually \n24 \nnamed Defendants and Does 1-50 were approved, tolerated, and/or ratified by policy making \n25 \nofficials for County, including, but not limited to, Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50. Plaintiff is \n26 \ninformed and believes, and thereupon alleges that the details of this incident have been revealed \n27 \nto the authorized policy makers within the County offices and that such policymakers have direct \n28 \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n10\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 11 of 16\n \n1  knowledge of the fact that Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons were wrongfully \n2  searched and subjected to other liberty deprivations due to their and their subordinates’ \n3  deliberate indifference and violations of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons’ rights. \n4  Notwithstanding this knowledge, the authorized policymakers within County, approved of the \n5  individually named Defendants’ and Does 1-50’s conduct and decisions in this matter to the \n6  extent such individuals were under their supervision and oversight, and have made a deliberate, \n7  conscious, and affirmative choice to endorse and ratify such conduct and decisions, and the basis \n8  for them, which resulted in the wrongful arrest and other liberty deprivations suffered by \n9  Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons. By doing so, the authorized policymakers within \n10  County have shown affirmative agreement with the conduct of individual Defendants and other \n11  employees/agents under their supervision, and have ratified the unconstitutional acts of these \n12  individual Defendants, employees, and agents.  \n13    40.  The aforementioned customs, policies, practices, and procedures; the failure to \n14  properly and adequately hire, train, instruct, monitor, supervise, evaluate, investigate, and \n15  discipline; and, the unconstitutional orders, approvals, ratification, and toleration of wrongful \n16  conduct of Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50 were a moving force and/or a proximate \n17  cause of the deprivation of Plaintiff’s clearly established and well-settled constitutional rights, in \n18  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as more fully set forth in the paragraphs above.  \n19    41.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing unconstitutional actions, \n20  omissions, customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of Defendants Hennessy, Fisher, and \n21  Does 1-50, or the lack of inadequacy thereof, Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons \n22  suffered liberty deprivations, incurred damages, and thus, they are entitled to damages, penalties, \n23  costs, and attorney’s fees, as set forth above, in ¶ 22, and punitive damages against Defendants \n24  Hennessy, Fisher, and Does 1-50, in their individual capacities. Furthermore, Plaintiff and all \n25  other similarly situated persons’ only means of securing complete and adequate relief is to also \n26  seek declaratory and injunctive relief, to offer Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons \n27  substantial and complete protection from Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices; the \n28 \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n11\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 12 of 16\n \n1  remedy at law is inadequate. Plaintiff, thus, seeks both legal damages and equitable remedies in \n2  the form of injunctive relief against Defendants County.  \n \n3 \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(CAL. CONST. ART. I, § 13) \n4 \nPLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \n5  COUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n6    42.  Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons re-alleges and incorporates by reference \n7  each and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n8    43.  The unreasonable search of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons \n9  violated Plaintiff all other similarly situated persons’ rights under Article 1, § 13 of the \n10  California Constitution, thereby entitling Plaintiff to damages for this violation.  \n11    44.  Defendant County is not sued directly in this cause of action, but is named \n12  because it is liable under California Government Code § 815.2 for injuries proximately caused \n13  by an act or omission of an employee, committed within the course and scope of the employee’s \n14  employment.  \n15    45.  As a proximate result of the foregoing wrongful acts, Plaintiff sustained injuries \n16  and damages, as set forth above, in ¶ 22. \n17    46.  Plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to general and compensatory damages in an amount \n18  to be proven at trial. \n19    47.  In committing the acts alleged above, Defendants acted maliciously and/or were \n20  guilty of wanton and reckless disregard for the rights, safety, and emotional well-being of \n21  Plaintiff, and by reason thereof, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary and punitive damages against \n22  these individual defendants in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n \n23 \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(CAL.

The unreasonable search of Plaintiff and all other similarly situated persons \n2  violated Plaintiff all other similarly situated persons’ rights under Article 1, § 17 of the \n3  California Constitution, thereby entitling Plaintiff to damages for this violation.  \n4    50.  Defendant County is not sued directly in this cause of action, but is named \n5  because it is liable under California Government Code § 815.2 for injuries proximately caused \n6  by an act or omission of an employee, committed within the course and scope of the employee’s \n7  employment.  \n8    51.  As a proximate result of the foregoing wrongful acts, Plaintiff sustained injuries \n9  and damages, as set forth above, in ¶ 22. \n10    52.  Plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to general and compensatory damages in an amount \n11  to be proven at trial. \n12    53.  In committing the acts alleged above, Defendants acted maliciously and/or were \n13  guilty of wanton and reckless disregard for the rights, safety, and emotional well-being of \n14  Plaintiff, and by reason thereof, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary and punitive damages against \n15  these individual defendants in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n \n16 \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 52.1(b)) \n17 \nPLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \n18  COUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n19    54.

Separate from, and above and beyond, Defendants’ attempted interference, \n6  interference with, and violation of Plaintiff’s rights, Defendants violated Plaintiff’s rights by the \n7  following conduct, among other conduct, constituting threat, intimidation, or coercion: \n \n8 \na. Intentionally and/or with deliberate indifference, causing Plaintiff to be \n9  subjected to unlawful searches and other liberty deprivations.  \n  57.  Defendant County is not sued directly in this cause of action, but is named \n10 \nbecause County is vicariously liable pursuant to California Government Code section 815.2.   \n11 \n  58.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violation of California Civil Code \n12 \n§ 52.1 and of Plaintiff’s rights under the United States and California Constitutions and law, \n13 \nPlaintiff sustained injuries and damages, and against each Defendant named in this Cause of \n14 \nAction is entitled to relief as set forth above, in ¶ 22, and punitive damages against all individual \n15 \nDefendants, including all damages and penalties allowed by California Civil Code §§ 52 and \n16 \n52.1 and California law, three times actual damages, and attorneys’ fees.  \n17 \n \n18  SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE § 2644) \n19 \nPLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \nCOUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n20 \n  59.

Defendant County is not sued directly in this cause of action, but is named \n26 \nbecause it is liable under California Government Code § 815.2 for injuries proximately caused \n27 \n28 \nPLAINTIFF’S CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND \n \n14\n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 1     Filed 11/20/19     Page 15 of 16\n \n1  by an act or omission of an employee, committed within the course and scope of the employee’s \n2  employment.  \n3    62.  As a proximate result of the foregoing wrongful acts, Plaintiff sustained injuries \n4  and damages, as set forth above, in ¶ 22. \n5    63.  Plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to general and compensatory damages in an amount \n6  to be proven at trial. \n7    64.  In committing the acts alleged above, Defendants acted maliciously and/or were \n8  guilty of wanton and reckless disregard for the rights, safety, and emotional well-being of \n9  Plaintiff, and by reason thereof, Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary and punitive damages against \n10  these individual defendants in an amount to be proven at trial. \n \n11 \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS) \n12 \nPLAINTIFF AND ALL SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS \n13  COUNTY, HENNESSY, FISHER and DOES 1-50 \n14    65.

Defendant County is not sued directly in this cause of action, but is named \n23  because it is vicariously liable pursuant to California Government Code § 815.2.  \n24    69.  As a proximate result of the foregoing wrongful acts, Plaintiff sustained injuries \n25  and damages, as set forth above, in ¶ 22.

The City and County of San Francisco operates active jails where it houses pretrial \n3  detainees and convicted prisoners.  \n4  2.  San Francisco County Jail #2, located at 425 7th Street in San Francisco, houses up \n5  to 392 persons and is the only jail in the City and County of San Francisco that houses women.  \n6  3.  Pretrial detainees—some with years long stays in the jail—have no access to outdoor \n7  recreation or access to sunlight, which causes physical detriments and severe mental anguish. The \n8  City and County of San Francisco, by policy, practice or custom, denies all pretrial detainees and \n9  convicted prisoners any opportunities for fresh air, direct sunlight, or time outside for exercise or \n10  recreation, or otherwise any meaningful recreation, in violation of Title 15 of the California Code of \n11  Regulations § 1065, and the prisoners’ Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights, respectively. \n12  These prisoners, some of whom are pretrial and have been incarcerated for as long as six or seven \n13  years, have never seen the sun or felt the wind’s breeze in the entire duration of their incarceration \n14  except very briefly during transports to the hospital, another facility, or to court. \n15  4.  Female pretrial detainees at County Jail #2 suffered further emotional anguish when \n16  female sheriff’s deputies at the jail forced them on at least two occasions to submit to unclothed \n17  body cavity searches while male deputies looked on. On or about November 20, 2018, female \n18  deputies at the San Francisco County Jail #2 conducted an unnecessary and unjustified visual \n19  body cavity search of pretrial and convicted female prisoners in the presence and direct view of at \n20  least three, and up to seven or more, male deputies. A similar, random, and unreasonable visual \n21  body cavity search of female prisoners was conducted in front of male deputies about a month \n22  prior. Upon information and belief, these searches have occurred in D-Pod, B-Pod, and possibly E-\n23  Pod.  \n24  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n25  5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n26  1343(a)(3)-(4) because it is being brought to obtain compensatory and punitive damages for the \n27  deprivations, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States that are secured \n28 \n \nPierce v.

This action is brought \n2  pursuant to the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \n3  and the laws and Constitution of the State of California. \n4  6.  Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated persons further invoke this Court’s \n5  supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), to hear and decide claims arising \n6  under state law. \n7  7.  Venue is proper, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)-(2), because the County of San \n8  Francisco Defendants reside in this judicial district, and the events or omissions giving rise to \n9  plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this judicial district. \n10  PARTIES AND PROCEDURE \n11  8.  Plaintiff Jillian Pierce was a pretrial detainee at San Francisco County Jail #2, from \napproximately July 2, 2018 to August 1, 2020. \n12 \n9.  Plaintiff Nicole Wade was a pretrial detainee at San Francisco County Jail #2, from \n13 \napproximately April 27, 2018 to June 10, 2021.  \n14 \n10.  Plaintiff Fantasy Decuir is a current pretrial detainee at San Francisco County Jail \n15 \n#2. She was booked into the jail on August 4, 2017. \n16 \n11.  Plaintiff Damena Page is a current pretrial detainee at San Francisco County Jail #2. \n17 \nShe was booked into the jail on October 14, 2020. \n18 \n12.  Plaintiff Vincent Bell is a current pretrial detainee at San Francisco County Jail #3. \n19 \nHe has been confined in the jail for over seven years in administrative segregation. At the time of \n20 \nthe filing of this lawsuit, Mr. Bell was housed in County Jail #2. \n21 \n13.  Defendant City and County of San Francisco (“CCSF”) is a municipal corporation, \n22 \nduly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is the employer of the \n23 \nindividual County defendants, as well as certain, to-be-identified CCSF employees. Under its \n24 \nauthority, CCSF operates the County of San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“SFSD”). At all \n25 \nmaterial times herein, CCSF was responsible for supervising, enacting, and enforcing the SFSD’s \n26  conduct, policies, and practices, was responsible for the absence of needed policies and practices, \n27  and was responsible for the hiring, retention, supervision, and training of employees and agents of \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 4 of 14\n \n1  the SFSD including such employees as Defendants, then-Chief Sheriff Vicki Hennessy \n2  (“Hennessy”), Chief Deputy Michele Fisher (“Fisher”), Chief Paul Miyamoto (“Miyamoto”), and \nthe to-be-identified CCSF employees.  \n3 \n14.  At all material times herein, defendant Vikki Hennessy was employed by defendant \n4 \nCCSF as the Sheriff, and was acting within the course and scope of that employment at such times. \n5 \nShe is being sued in her individual and official capacities as the SFSD Sheriff. At all material times, \n6 \nSheriff Hennessy was the final policy making official for the SFSD, ultimately responsible for all \n7 \npolicies, procedures, supervision, and training of the SFSD. \n8 \n15.  At all material times herein, defendant Michele Fisher was employed by Defendant \n9 \nCCSF as a Chief Deputy, and was acting within the course and scope of that employment at such \n10 \ntimes. She is being sued in her individual and official capacity as a Chief Deputy. Upon \n11 \ninformation and belief, Defendant Fisher supervised DOES 1-50, and was ultimately responsible \n12 \nfor enforcing policies, procedures, supervision, and the training of them. \n13 \n16.  As of January 8, 2020, defendant Paul Miyamoto was employed by defendant CCSF \n14 \nas the Sheriff, and was acting within the course and scope of that employment at such times. He is \n15 \nbeing sued in his individual and official capacities as the SFSD Sheriff. At all material times, \n16 \nSheriff Miyamoto was the final policy making official for the SFSD, ultimately responsible for all \n17  policies, procedures, supervision, and training of the SFSD.  \n18  17.  Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that each of the defendants sued herein \n19  was wrongfully, deliberately indifferently, negligently, and/or otherwise responsible in some \n20  manner for the events and happenings as hereinafter described, and proximately caused injuries \nand damages to plaintiffs. Further, certain unknown defendants were at all material times \n21 \nresponsible for the hiring, training, supervision, and discipline of other defendants, including both \n22 \nthe individually named and unknown deputy defendants. \n23 \n18.  Plaintiffs are informed, believe, and thereon allege that each of the defendants was at \n24 \nall material times an agent, servant, employee, partner, joint venturer, co-conspirator, and/or alter \n25 \nego of the remaining defendants, and in doing the things hereinafter alleged, was acting within the \n26 \ncourse and scope of that relationship. Plaintiffs are further informed, believe, and thereon allege \n27 \nthat each of the defendants herein gave consent, aid, and assistance to each of the remaining \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 5 of 14\n \n1  defendants, and ratified and/or authorized the acts or omissions of each defendant as alleged \n2  herein, except as may hereinafter be otherwise, specifically alleged. At all material times, each \ndefendant was an integral participant, jointly and fundamentally engaged in constitutionally \n3 \nviolative, unlawful, and/or tortious activity, resulting in the deprivation of plaintiffs’ constitutional \n4 \nrights and other actionable harm. \n5 \n19.  The acts and omissions of all defendants were at all material times pursuant to the \n6 \nactual customs, policies, practices, and/or procedures of CCSF and/or the SFSD.   \n7 \n20.  At all material times, each defendant acted under color of the laws, statutes, \n8 \nordinances, and regulations of the State of California.   \n9 \nEXHAUSTION \n10 \n21.  Plaintiff Jillian Pierce presented a proper and timely tort claim to CCSF, pursuant to \n11 \nGovernment Code § 910 et seq., regarding the unlawful unclothed body cavity searches on May 13, \n12 \n2019. Plaintiff Jillian Pierce subsequently submitted a claim to CCSF regarding the denial of \n13 \noutdoor recreation and the lack of sunlight in July or August of 2019. \n14 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n15 \nLack of Outdoor Recreation \n16 \n22.  Jillian Pierce spent two years as a pretrial detainee in County Jail #2. Nicole Wade \n17 \nspent over three years as a pretrial detainee at County Jail #2. Fantasy Decuir has been confined at \n18 \nCounty Jail #2 awaiting trial since August 4, 2017. Damena Page has been confined at County Jail \n19 \n#2 awaiting trail since October 14, 2020. Vincent Bell has been in the custody of CCSF awaiting \n20  trial since December 11, 2012. \n21  23.  Pretrial detainees commonly spend months to years in San Francisco County Jail #2 \n22  awaiting trial. While incarcerated, they are denied any and all access to outdoor recreation and \n23  direct sunlight.  \n24.  The denial of access to outdoor recreation or direct sunlight is due to the jail’s \n24 \ndeliberate and thought-out design and logistical limitations. The denial of sufficient and adequate \n25 \nrecreation is a violation of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations § 1065. On information \n26 \nand belief, CCSF pays a fine every month for being in violation of this section. \n27 \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 6 of 14\n \n1  25.  Additionally, all prisoners housed in County Jail #2, including pretrial detainees, are \n2  denied meaningful recreation. Although there is a gym in the facility, access to the gym is irregular \nand infrequent. In 2018 and 2019, prisoners went to the gym on an average of once a month and \n3 \nfor an hour and a half at most. Prisoners in administrative segregation and prisoners housed in C-\n4 \nPod are categorically denied gym access except on very rare and random occasions.  \n5 \n26.  Furthermore, the gym was deliberately designed to restrict penetrative light and \n6 \nfresh air flow. The gym is dark and the windows are covered in metal screens and open only \n7 \nslightly. Prisoners are not allowed to stand, sit, or congregate by the windows.   \n8 \n27.  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the gym is inaccessible to all \n9 \nprisoners housed in County Jail #2, including pretrial detainees. All prisoners are further denied \n10 \nany meaningful recreation, and are prohibiting from exercising in their pod. \n11 \n28.  County Jail #2 also has an atrium that provides filtered sunlight but does not allow \n12 \nfresh air. However, the atrium was and is not accessible to all prisoners, including pretrial \n13 \ndetainees.  \n14 \n29.  Ms. Pierce and others at the San Francisco County Jail #2 submitted grievances for \n15 \nbeing denied exercise and recreation time in violation of Title 15. These grievances were largely \n16 \nignored.  \n17  30.  Due to the denial of outdoor recreation, all plaintiffs have suffered stress, anxiety, \n18  depression, and skin discoloration. Plaintiffs suffered acne, unhealthy weight gain, and/or other \n19  physical ailments. The lack of exposure to the outdoors also puts pretrial detainees at substantial \n20  risk of serious harm. Research shows direct sunlight provides benefits beyond visual comfort and \nbroad health. The denial of sunlight causes problems including, but not limited to, weak bones, \n21 \nsome cancers, anxiety, depression, skin problems, weight gain, cognitive issues, tiredness, and \n22 \nsleeplessness. Furthermore, direct sunlight influences air quality and eliminates germs, skin \n23 \nbacteria, and bacteria known to cause respiratory disease.   \n24 \n31.  As aforementioned, all prisoners, pretrial and convicted, housed at San Francisco \n25 \nCounty Jail #2 are denied any opportunity for outdoor exercise or recreation. Some of these \n26 \nprisoners have yet to be convicted and have been incarcerated for years without once being able to \n27 \ngo outside and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. Plaintiffs, in the entire duration of their respective \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 7 of 14\n \n1  lengths of incarceration were denied any meaningful opportunity to be outside, feel direct sunlight \n2  on their skin, and breathe fresh air. \nCross Gender Unclothed Body Cavity Searches \n3 \n32.  On or about November 20, 2018 at approximately 7:30 AM, CCSF employees \n4 \nordered all female prisoners in D-Pod, both pretrial and convicted, to wake up and congregate by \n5 \nthe tables located on the lower level of the pod. The CCSF employees then ordered the prisoners, \n6 \nin groups of three, to enter into the three bathroom stalls located on the same level and remove \n7 \ntheir clothing, squat, cough, spread open their vaginas and anuses, and lift their breasts for visual \n8 \ninspection. At all times throughout the visual body cavity search, the bathroom stall doors \n9 \nremained open and were conducted in the presence and direct view of at least three, and possibly \n10 \nup to seven or more, unknown male deputies. The male deputies were situated throughout the \n11 \npod, including the staircase and upper level, where they could see directly into the bathroom stalls, \n12 \nwhile they watched the searches take place. This search was random, unnecessary, unjustified and \n13 \nmade pursuant to SFSD protocol, policy, custom, or practice. \n14 \n33.  Upon information and belief, the visual body cavity search of female prisoners also \n15 \noccurred in B-Pod and/or E-Pod, where male deputies were permitted to watch. \n16  34.  Sometime in October 2018, about a month prior, a similar visual body cavity search \n17  occurred in D-Pod at approximately 7:30 AM. Like the November 20th search, CCSF employees \n18  ordered the female prisoners, in groups of three and in the open bathroom stalls, to remove their \n19  clothing, squat, cough, spread open their vaginas and anuses, and lift their breasts for visual \n20  inspection in the presence of unknown male deputies, who watched as the searches were \nconducted. Like the November 20th search, this search was conducted pursuant to SFSD protocol, \n21 \npolicy, custom, or practice and was unnecessary and unjustified. \n22 \n35.  On information and belief, following one of the unclothed body cavity searches, a \n23 \nmale deputy who observed the search commented that he found the female prisoners attractive \n24 \nand did not have a girlfriend. \n25 \n36.  After both body cavity searches, Ms. Pierce and other prisoners filed grievances \n26 \nregarding the body cavity searches conducted in the presence of male deputies. Many, if not all, \n27 \ngrievances were ignored and the prisoners never received responses. At least three investigators \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 8 of 14\n \n1  came to D-Pod as a result. Upon information and belief, one of the investigators was Jesse Huber. \n2  The investigators interviewed the female prisoners but plaintiffs do not know what, if anything, \ncame about following their investigations. \n3 \n37.  At all material times and, alternatively, the actions and omissions of each defendant \n4 \nwas intentional, and/or wanton, and/or willful, and/or reckless, and/or callous, and/or malicious, \n5 \nand/or deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs’ rights, and/or grossly negligent, and/or negligent \n6 \nand/or pursuant to SFSD policies, customs, or practices. \n7 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n8 \n38.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated \n9  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) on the basis that there is a well-defined \n10  community of interest in this litigation, the proposed class is easily ascertainable, and the \n11  proposed class is quite numerous.  \n12  39.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: All past, present, and future pretrial \n13  detainees housed at San Francisco County Jail #2, located at 425 7th Street in San Francisco, CA. \n40.  Plaintiffs Jillian Pierce, Nicole Wade, and Fantasy Decuir seek to represent the \n14 \nfollowing subclass: All women at San Francisco County Jail #2 who have been subjected to cross \n15 \ngender visual body cavity searches. This subclass will be known as the Cross Gender Search \n16 \nSubclass. \n17 \n41.  Plaintiffs and the putative class were and are regularly subjected to the \n18 \nconstitutional and statutory violations described in this complaint. On information and belief, the \n19 \nlegal and factual issues are common to the class and affect all class members.  \n20 \n42.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend or modify the class and subclass descriptions \n21 \nwith greater specificity or further division into subclasses, as well as to limit the class or \n22 \nsubclasses to particular issues, as warranted.  \n23 \nNumerosity \n24 \n43.  The potential members of the class and of the subclasses as defined are so numerous \n25 \nthat joinder of all of them is impracticable. While the precise number of class members has not \n26 \nbeen determined at this time, plaintiffs are informed and believe that the class is comprised of \n27 \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 9 of 14\n \n1  more than 100 individuals. The potential members of the Cross Gender Search subclass exceed 48 \n2  women.  \nCommonality and Predominance \n3 \n44.  There are questions of law and fact that are common to the class and subclasses and \n4 \npredominate over individualized questions. These common questions of law and fact include, \n5 \nwithout limitation: \n6 \n45.  Whether CCSF denies all pretrial detainees access to outdoor recreation without \n7 \njustification and in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights;  \n8 \n46.  Whether CCSF subjected female prisoners of D-Pod, and B-Pod and/or E-Pod, to \n9 \nunreasonable and unnecessary cross gender visual body cavity searches;  \n10 \n47.  Whether CCSF defendants, with threat, intimidation, and/or coercion, violated \n11 \nplaintiffs’ rights under California Civil Code § 52.1 by denying detainees the right to outdoor \n12 \nrecreation with malice and oppression and the intent to deprive plaintiffs of their rights to be free \n13 \nfrom constitutional and statutory violations; and \n14 \n48.  Whether plaintiffs and other class members are entitled to damages, injunctive and \n15 \ndeclaratory relief, attorneys’ fees, interest, and costs, and other relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n16 \n1988.  \n17  Typicality \n18  49.  Named plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of putative class and subclass \n19  members. Plaintiffs and all members of the putative class and subclasses sustained injuries and \n20  damages arising out of and caused by defendants' common course of conduct, which, as alleged \nherein, violates federal and California law. \n21 \nAdequacy of Representation \n22 \n50.  Plaintiffs adequately represent and protect the interests of class and subclass \n23 \nmembers. Plaintiffs have no interests which are adverse to the class. Plaintiffs are similarly \n24 \nsituated to other class and subclass members. Counsel who represents plaintiffs are competent \n25 \nand experienced in litigating civil rights class actions, wage and hour cases, and class actions \n26 \ngenerally. \n27 \n \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 10 of 14\n \n1  Superiority of Class Action \n2  51.  A class action is superior to other available means for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. Individual joinder of all class members is not practicable, and \n3 \nquestions of law and fact common to the class predominate over any questions affecting only \n4 \nindividual members of the class. Each member of the class has been damaged and is entitled to \n5 \nrecovery by reason of the unlawful policies and practices described herein. Class members are \n6 \nunlikely to otherwise obtain effective representation to ensure full enforcement of their rights \n7 \nabsent class certification. \n8 \n52.  Class action treatment will allow those similarly situated persons to litigate their \n9 \nclaims in the manner that is most efficient and economical for the parties and the judicial system. \n10 \nPlaintiffs are unaware of any difficulties that are likely to be encountered in the management of \n11 \nthis action that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. \n12 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDENIAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION IN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH \n13 \nAMENDMENT \n14  (Plaintiffs against all defendants.) \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n15 \n53.  Plaintiffs and all similarly situated persons re-alleges and incorporates by reference \n16 \neach and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n17 \n54.  By the actions and omissions described above, the defendants named above in this \n18 \ncause of action, acting under the color of state law in their individual capacities, violated 42 U.S.C. \n19 \n§ 1983, by depriving plaintiffs of their well-settled constitutional rights to outdoor recreation \n20 \nopportunities protected by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Such \n21 \ndenials were pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom, policy, or ratification wherein CCSF \n22 \ndeliberately designed San Francisco County Jail #2 without an outdoor recreation area and \n23 \nchooses to pay a monthly fine for violating Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations § 1065 \n24 \namong various alternatives, including rectifying its constitutionally violative action. \n25 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n26  CROSS GENDER VISUAL BODY CAVITY SEARCH IN VIOLATION OF THE \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \n27  (Plaintiffs Jillian Pierce, Nicole Wade, and Fantasy Decuir against all defendants.) \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 11 of 14\n \n1  55.  Plaintiffs and all similarly situated persons re-alleges and incorporates by reference \n2  each and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n3  56.  By the actions and omissions described above, the defendants named above in this \n4  cause of action, acting under the color of state law in their individual capacities, violated 42 U.S.C. \n5  § 1983, depriving plaintiffs of their well-settled constitutional rights to be free of unreasonable and \n6  unnecessary body cavity searches by the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \n7  Constitution. Such searches were pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom, policy, or \n8  ratification wherein CCSF deliberately chose to conduct such searches that CCSF final-policy \n9  makers ratified, and that CCSF knew or should have known were unconstitutional. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10 \nMONELL and SUPERVISORY LIABILITY \n11  (Plaintiffs against CCSF.) \n (42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n12 \n57.  Plaintiffs and all similarly situated persons re-allege and incorporate by reference \n13 \neach and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n14 \n58.  Defendant CCSF deliberately designed San Francisco County Jail #2 without an \n15 \nindoor recreation area and has a pattern and practice of deliberately denying pretrial detainees \n16 \ntheir constitutional right to access to outdoor recreation, as indicated by its payment of a monthly \n17  fine in lieu of providing detainees with outdoor recreation opportunities. Moreover, defendant \n18  CCSF put into motion and/or ratified the unreasonable and unnecessary cross gender visual body \n19  searches of its female detainees on at least two occasions. \n20  59.  By the actions and omissions described above, defendant supervisors Hennessy, \n21  Fisher, and Miyamoto, acting under the color of state law in their individual capacities, failed to \nintervene in the violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights when they deliberately chose to pay a \n22 \nmonthly fine in lieu of providing detainees with outdoor recreation opportunities and set in \n23 \nmotion and/or ratified cross gender visual body cavity searches of female detainees. \n24 \n60.  The above-described customs, polices, practices, and/or procedures of CCSF were a \n25 \nmoving force and/or a proximate cause of the deprivations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, in \n26 \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n27 \n \n28 \n \nPierce v. CCSF, No. 4:19-cv-07659-JSW \n \nSecond Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial - 11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW     Document 66     Filed 11/05/21     Page 12 of 14\n \n1  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nVIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BANE ACT \n2 \n(Plaintiffs against all defendants.) \n (California Code of Civil Procedure § 52.1(b)) \n3 \n61.  Plaintiffs and all similarly situated persons re-allege and incorporate by reference \n4 \neach and every allegation contained in the paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  \n5 \n62.  By their acts, omissions, customs, and policies, defendants CCSF, Hennessy, Fisher, \n6 \nMiyamoto, and unknown CCSF employees acting in concert/conspiracy, as described above, and \n7 \nwith threat, intimidation, and/or coercion, violated plaintiffs’ rights under California Civil Code § \n8 \n52.1 by denying detainees the right to outdoor recreation under the United States Constitution, \n9 \nand California Constitution, Article 1, Sections 7, 13, and 17, respectively.  \n10 \n63.  By their acts, omissions, customs, and policies, defendants CCSF, Hennessy, Fisher, \n11 \nMiyamoto, and unknown CCSF employees acting in concert/conspiracy, as described above, and \n12 \nwith threat, intimidation, and/or coercion, violated plaintiffs’ rights under California Civil Code § \n13  52.1 by subjecting female detainees to unreasonable and unnecessary visual body cavity searches \n14  under the United States Constitution, and California Constitution, Article 1, Sections 7, 13, and 17, \n15  respectively.   \n16  64.  By virtue of the foregoing, all defendants acted with malice and oppression and the \n17  intent to deprive and did deprive plaintiffs of their rights to be free from constitutionally and \nstatutorily violations.  \n18 \nDAMAGES \n19 \n65.  Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated persons have incurred, and continue to \n20 \nincur, constitutional, emotional, physical, and psychological harms and losses, as well as ongoing \n21 \nstress and anxiety, as a result of defendants’ tortious, wrongful, and constitutionally violative \n22 \nconduct.  \n23 \n66.  As a direct and proximate result of each defendants’ acts and/or omissions as set \n24 \nforth above, plaintiffs and all others similarly situated persons sustained, and are currently \n25 \nsustaining, the following injuries and damages, past and future, including, but not limited to: \n26 \na.  Compensatory damages for all constitutional and/or statutory violations; \n27 \n28 \n \nPierce v.

Emotional distress, fear, anxiety, sleeplessness, humiliation, indignity, vitamin D \n2  deficiencies, and loss of liberty; \nc.  Loss of enjoyment of life and other continued pain and suffering;  \n3 \nd.  All other legally cognizable special and general damages; \n4 \ne.  Violations of state and federal constitutional rights; and \n5 \nf.  All damages and penalties recoverable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, California \n6 \nCivil Code § 52, California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5, and as otherwise allowed \n7 \nunder California and United States statutes, codes, and common law. \n8 \nPUNITIVE DAMAGES \n9 \n67.  The individual defendants, in denying plaintiffs their rights secured by the \n10 \nConstitution of the United States, acted with malice and oppression and/or with reckless \n11 \nindifference to plaintiffs’ protected rights and is liable to plaintiffs for punitive damages. \n12 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13 \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully requests the following relief against each and every \n14 \ndefendant herein, jointly and severally: \n15 \na.

Defendants’ response is due on May 29, 2020, pursuant to a stipulation of \n2  the parties and Order of this Court. (ECF No. 30.) \n3    Defendant City and County of San Francisco is named in two other cases in the \n4  Northern District of California addressing similar conditions issues at San Francisco \n5  County Jails #4 and #5, located at 850 Bryant Street, 7th Floor in San Francisco and 1 \n6  Moreland Drive in San Bruno, respectively. The cases are Norbert v. San Francisco \n7  Sheriff’s Department, No. 19-cv-02724-SK and Poot v. San Francisco Sheriff’s \n8  Department, No. 19-cv-02722-YGR.  \n9    Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler is overseeing settlement negotiations in Norbert \n10  and Poot. The parties in those matters and the undersigned agree that judicial economy \n11  would be well served by referring this matter to Judge Beeler for settlement. \n12    Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint raises claims for relief related to cross \n13  gender body cavity searches that are not at issue in Norbert or Poot. However, the \n14  parties are amenable to attempting a resolution of both issues through settlement with \n15  Judge Beeler.  \n16    In an effort to be as efficient as possible, the parties stipulate and respectfully \n17  request that the Court refer this entire matter to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler for \n18  settlement. The parties further stipulate and respectfully request that the Court vacate \n19  all current deadlines in this matter, including the deadline for defendants’ response to \n20  plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, and allow the parties to attempt early resolution. \n21  The parties request a deadline for a joint status update to the Court be set for June 30, \n22  2020, at which time the parties will inform the Court of its progress on settlement and \n23  reset case management dates in this matter if prudent at that time. Although the parties \n24  will make a good faith effort to resolve all claims in the case, the parties contemplate \n25  that some but not all of plaintiffs’ claims may be resolved by participating in the Norbert \n26  and Poot settlement discussions with Judge Beeler. In that event, the parties will \n27  provide the Court with that information in their joint status update and may at that time \n28 \n \nPierce v.

Lastly, the outstanding motions for class certification are \nDENIED as they are rendered moot by this Court’s ruling herein on the motions for summary \n28 \njudgment.  (Dkt. Nos. 73, 76.)   \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 2 of 10\n \n1  BACKGROUND \n2    The City and County of San Francisco designed and constructed County Jail No. 2 (“CJ2”) \n3  located at 725 7th Street in San Francisco, without outdoor recreation space.  Initially the building \n4  was designated as a work furlough facility, but it is now utilized exclusively as a jail.  All pretrial \n5  detainees housed in CJ2 have not been provided outdoor recreation opportunities since 1994 when \n6  the facility opened.  Plaintiffs, past and present pretrial detainees at CJ2, allege that the County has \n7  a pattern and practice of deliberately denying detainees meaningful recreational opportunities.  \n8  Although CJ2 has a gym and an atrium, Plaintiffs allege that neither provides direct sunlight and \n9  that, prior to the onset of Covid-19, pretrial detainees were routinely taken to the gym at nighttime \n10  after the sun had set.  The atrium provides filtered light and no fresh air.  Plaintiffs allege that the \n11  space was not made available to pretrial detainees regularly, and prior to Covid-19, was only made \n12  available for the limited purpose of legal visits.  Plaintiffs allege that most pretrial detainees have \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  never been to the atrium.  Post onset of Covid-19, Plaintiffs allege that the gym has not been used \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  for inmate recreation.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Separately, Plaintiffs also allege that between March 30, 2018 and August 21, 2020, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants indiscriminately subjected 414 female pretrial detainees housed in CJ2 to \nS d nr\nee 17  unreasonable and non-emergent unclothed body cavity searches in the presence of male deputies \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and other women.  Plaintiffs claim that these searches occurred eight times in less than two years, \n19  thereby establishing a pattern or practice of subjecting the female pretrial detainees to searches in \n20  violation of their constitutional rights and in violation of the Bane Act.  Plaintiffs allege that \n21  deputies ordered the female detainees to congregate together outside of the cells and then were \n22  taken in groups of three to separate bathroom stalls where they were ordered to remove their \n23  clothing, squat, cough, open their mouths, lift their breasts, and spread open their anuses for visual \n24  inspection for contraband materials.  Plaintiffs claim that at all times these visual inspections were \n25  conducted by female deputies but in the presence and view of between three and seven male \n26  deputies.  They also allege the searches were random, unnecessary, and unjustified in violation of \n27  the jail manual and federal law.   \n28    The Court shall address other specific facts in the remainder of its order. \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  ANALYSIS \n2  A.  Legal Standard on Motion for Summary Judgment. \n3  Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, discovery and affidavits show that there \n4  is “no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a \n5  matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of \n6  the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute as to a material \n7  fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the \n8  nonmoving party.  \n9  The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those \n10  portions of the pleadings, discovery and affidavits which demonstrate the absence of a genuine \n11  issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Cattrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  When the moving \n12  party has met this burden of production, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  by its own affidavits or discovery, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  trial.  If the nonmoving party fails to produce enough evidence to show a genuine issue of material \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  fact, the moving party wins.  Id. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  At summary judgment, the judge must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nS d nr\nee 17  nonmoving party: if evidence produced by the moving party conflicts with evidence produced by \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the nonmoving party, the judge must assume the truth of the evidence set forth by the nonmoving \n19  party with respect to that fact.  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 656-57 (2014).   \n20  B.  Outdoor Recreation Claims. \n21    It is undisputed that CJ2 lacks an outdoor recreation area and is located in downtown San \n22  Francisco.  It is also therefore undisputed that the facility cannot provide outdoor recreation \n23  opportunities to pretrial detainees in custody there.  Plaintiffs allege that the denial of outdoor \n24  recreation is a violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections pursuant to 18 \n25  U.S.C. section 1983, as well as implicating supervisory liability under Monell, and a violation of \n26  the California Bane Act, California Civil Code section 52.1(b).  Plaintiffs pray for relief, including \n27  punitive damages. \n28    Section 1983 provides a cause of action for violation of a plaintiff’s constitutional rights by \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  persons acting under the color of state law.  Nurre v. Whitehead, 580 F.3d 1087, 1092 (9th Cir. \n2  2009).  Plaintiffs contend that the lack of outdoor recreation options violates the Eighth and \n3  Fourteenth Amendments.  The Eighth Amendment applies only to post-conviction inmates.  \n4  Consequently, the Court shall review the Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence for Plaintiffs who \n5  are all pretrial detainees.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535, n.16 (1979) (holding that when \n6  pretrial detainees challenge the condition of their confinement, the question is whether the \n7  conditions amount to punishment in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n8  Amendment); see also Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at \n9  535 n.16) (holding that the claims of pretrial detainees “are analyzed under the Fourteenth \n10  Amendment Due Process Clause, rather than under the Eighth Amendment.”).  The Fourteenth \n11  Amendment, furthermore, provides more protection than the Eighth Amendment because is \n12  “prohibits all punishment of pretrial detainees.”  Vasquez v. County of Kern, 949 F.3d 1153, 1163-\na \ntr in\nuoro 13  64 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1029 (9th Cir. 2004)).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    For any particular governmental action to constitute punishment “(1) that action must \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  cause the detainee to suffer from harm or ‘disability,’ and (2) the purpose of the governmental \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  action must be to punish the detainee.”  Demery, 378 F.3d at 1029.  “If a particular condition or \nS d nr\nee 17  restriction of pre-trial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  does not, without more, amount to ‘punishment.’”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 539.  In order to “constitute \n19  punishment, the harm or disability caused by the government’s action must either significantly \n20  exceed, or be independent of, the inherent discomforts of confinement.”  Demery, 378 F.3d at \n21  1030.  \n22    Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell, a jail’s primary obligations are to provide \n23  “adequate food, clothing, shelter, sanitation, medical care and personal safety.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at \n24  529 n.11.  The Ninth Circuit has held that courts must consider the conditions of confinement and \n25  has confirmed, “time and time again, that the Constitution requires jail officials to provide outdoor \n26  recreation opportunity, or otherwise meaningful recreation, to prison inmates.”  Shorter v. Baca, \n27  895 F.3d 1176, 1185 (9th Cir. 2018) (emphasis added).  The undisputed record in this case \n28  indicates that there is no option for outdoor exercise or outdoor recreation for inmates held in CJ2.  \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  Thus, the only determination the Court must make is whether CJ2 provides otherwise meaningful, \n2  indoor exercise or recreation to its inmates. \n3    Although the Constitution provides that jails cannot deny inmates the opportunity for \n4  exercise, the Ninth Circuit has declined to determine that the Constitution requires a specific \n5  minimum amount of time for recreation for pretrial detainees.  See Pierce v. County of Orange, \n6  526 F.3d 1190, 1212 (9th Cir. 2008).  In Pierce, the jail had only provided ninety minutes of \n7  indoor exercise per week.  The court held that did not satisfy constitutional minimum and \n8  reinstated a prior injunction which required that the jail provide inmates two hours of indoor \n9  recreation per week.  Id. at 1212-13; see also Candler v. Santa Rita Cty. Jail Watch Commander, \n10  No. 11-CV-01992-CW, 2015 WL 333298, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 26, 2015) (holding that, under \n11  Pierce, providing two hours of recreation weekly met constitutional standards).  Further, “the \n12  constitutionality of conditions for inmate exercise must be evaluated based on the full extent of the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  available recreational opportunities.”  Norbert v. City and County of San Francisco, 10 F.4th 918, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  929 (9th Cir. 2021). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Accordingly, the Court finds that the provision of three hours of indoor recreation time per \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  week, distributed over time, does not violate constitutional limitations and is what the applicable \nS d nr\nee 17  state regulations require.  Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations sets out the requirement \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of a minimum of three hours of recreation weekly for long-term inmates.  15 Cal. Code Regs. § \n19  1065.  The regulations specify that the recreation time must be “distributed over seven days.”  Id.  \n20  The record before this Court indicates that although CJ2 provided three hours recreation time \n21  weekly to inmates, at least in 2020, it failed to distribute those hours over the seven days.  \n22  (Declaration of Andrew Chan King, ¶ 9; Ex. L.)  Defendants provide undisputed evidence that the \n23  jail used to provide structured group movement and exercise classes three days a week for an hour, \n24  and also that the gym was available to inmates.  (Declaration of Marcela Espino (“Espino Decl.”), \n25  ¶ 2; Declaration of Jason Jackson (“Jackson Decl.”), ¶ 11.)  The gym has a treadmill, bikes, and \n26  resistance machines as well as a ping pong table and board games.  The gym also has a radio for \n27  inmates’ use and four bathroom stalls and sinks from which inmates can obtain water.  (Jackson \n28  Decl., ¶ 7.)  Exercise at the gym and structured group exercise classes have been suspended due to \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  Covid-19 protocols.  (Id. at ¶ 12; Espino Decl., ¶ 5.)  Defendants indicate their intention to restart \n2  exercise classes in the fall of 2022.  (Espino Decl., ¶ 6.) \n3    In addition, the evidentiary record provides that inmates in the general population have \n4  several hours of free time per day (generally 4.5 hours during the weekdays and 8 hours during the \n5  weekend) to use the common areas in their residential pods.  (Jackson Declaration at ¶ 10.)  \n6  During this free time, inmates are not confined to their cells and are permitted to recreate, \n7  including walking around the pod, reading, watching TV, playing board games, and making phone \n8  calls.  (Id.)  In addition, during this time, inmates are permitted to exercise in the pods, including \n9  doing push-ups, sit ups, squats, planks, lunges, etc.  (Id.)  None of the named plaintiffs dispute that \n10  they were permitted this recreation time.   \n11     Based on this Court’s finding that the hours provided to inmates at CJ2 are sufficient to \n12  pass constitutional muster under existing precedent, the Court similarly finds that the Monell claim \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  and the Bane Act claims, which depend upon a finding of unconstitutional treatment, similarly \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  fail.  The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs’ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  motion for summary judgment regarding the outdoor recreation claim. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  C.  Cross-Gender Search Claim. \nS d nr\nee 17    Defendants also move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims relating to the cross-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  gender viewing by male deputies of non-emergent unclothed body cavity searches performed by \n19  female deputies on 414 female pretrial detainees.  Plaintiffs claim that these searches occurred \n20  eight times in less than two years, thereby establishing a pattern or practice of subjecting female \n21  pretrial detainees to searches in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Plaintiffs also \n22  allege related claims for Monell and supervisory liability in violation of 42 U.S.C. section 1983, \n23  and violation of the Bane Act. \n24    The search policy of the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department issued on January 24, 2004 \n25  defines the policies and procedures of various kinds of searches, including physical body cavity \n26  searches.  “Strip Search” is defined as “[a] search that requires a person to remove or arrange some \n27  or all of their clothing to permit a visual inspection of the breasts, buttocks or genitalia of such \n28  person.  A strip search may also include a visual inspection of the person’s body cavities.”  \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  (Declaration of Raymond R. Rollan (“Rollan Decl.”), ¶ 5, Ex. D at 1.E.)  By contrast, a “Physical \n2  Body Cavity Search” is defined as “a physical intrusion into a body cavity, such as the mouth, \n3  stomach, rectum, or vagina, for the purpose of discovering any object concealed in the body \n4  cavity.  This type of search requires a valid search warrant and must be conducted by medical \n5  employees at a medical facility.”  (Id. at ¶ 1.C.)  The policies also provide that pre-sentenced, \n6  booked inmates “may be strip searched at any time if there is reasonable suspicion and supervisor \n7  approval on the Strip Search Authorization form prior to the strip search.”  (Id. at ¶ III.C.)  \n8  However, prior approval of the strip search is not necessary where there is a “legitimate reason \n9  such as a security search of their housing unit exists to conduct another search; or [if the inmate] \n10  has been found to possess contraband during a prior search.”  (Id.)   Sentenced inmates, on the \n11  other hand, “may be strip searched at any time as part of a security search.”  (Id. at ¶ III.D.)   \n12    The policies further provide that “[a]n SFSO sworn employee will take all reasonable \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  measures to minimize the extent to which strip searches intrude on an individual’s privacy.”  (Id. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  at ¶ IV.)  Further, “[a]ll strip searches shall be conducted in a private location, such that persons \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  not participating in the search cannot observe the person being searched.”  (Id. at ¶ IV.A.1.)  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Lastly, the policies specifically provide that “[a]ll SFSO sworn employees present at the search \nS d nr\nee 17  shall be of the same gender identity as the person being searched except in emergency situations.”  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (Id. at ¶ IV.A.3.)   \n19    The undisputed evidence before the Court, including video footage of one of the searches \n20  conducted on November 20, 2018, indicates that female pretrial detainees may have been \n21  subjected to incidental viewing by male deputies while undergoing strip searches.  Male deputies \n22  who were on duty in the pod during the searches were tasked with securing the pod and searching \n23  common areas while female deputies took groups of two to three inmates to a lower level \n24  bathroom with exterior glass walls for the searches.  (Declaration of Lt. Brian Krol (“Krol Decl.”), \n25  ¶¶ 11-15.)  All SFSO deputies are trained to minimize exposure of the inmates during the strip \n26  search process to anyone outside of the bathroom stall area, including blocking any opening with \n27  their bodies while a strip search is conducted.  (Id. at ¶ 19.)   \n28    While the evidence demonstrates that the searches themselves were carried out by female \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  deputies in private bathroom or shower stalls, any viewing by male deputies or others of the \n2  inmates was incidental.  Plaintiffs testified that they could see male deputies in the pod while they \n3  were strip searched, but none testified that the male deputies were present in the immediate area of \n4  the searches or that they made lewd or inappropriate comments.   Of the named plaintiffs, only \n5  Plaintiff Pierce testified that she had observed male deputies looking in the direction of the \n6  bathroom stalls.  (Rollan Decl., Ex. G at 133:4-14; 135:22-25.)  The video footage viewed by the \n7  Court evidenced several male deputies present in the pod, but in a separate location where they \n8  walked around and remained preoccupied by other tasks.  (Id., Ex. H.)  There is no evidence in the \n9  record that the male deputies were present at the site of the strip searches or were staring into the \n10  stalls where the searches actually took place.  (See id.)   \n11    Plaintiffs allege that the potential viewing of the strip searches by male deputies violated \n12  their Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy and bodily autonomy.  The Ninth Circuit has held \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that the right to privacy, including the right to shield one’s naked body from view by persons of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the opposite sex, applies in the prison context.  See, e.g., Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  333 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that “incarcerated prisoners retain a limited right to bodily privacy.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Shielding one’s unclothed figure from the view of strangers, particularly strangers of the opposite \nS d nr\nee 17  sex is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.”) (citing Grummett v, Rushen, 779 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir. 1985)); see also Cumbey v. Meachum, 684 F.2d 721, 713 (10th Cir. 1982) \n19  (“Although the inmates’ right to privacy must yield to the penal institution’s need to maintain \n20  security, it does not vanish altogether.”).  The Court must analyze the claim by deciding whether \n21  the impingement on inmates’ right to privacy by having male deputies monitor the pod while \n22  female deputies conducted the body searches is “reasonably related to legitimate penological \n23  interests.”  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 87 (1987).  \n24    In Grummett, the Ninth Circuit considered an action brought by male inmates who alleged \n25  that female guards were viewing them in states of partial or total nudity while dressing, showering, \n26  being strip searched, using the toilet, all in violation of their right to privacy.  889 F.2d at 492.  \n27  Female guards were not assigned to positions of frequent surveillance of the inmates but were \n28  found to be in positions requiring only infrequent and casual observation, or observation from a \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  distance.  Id. at 494.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that inmates had not demonstrated “restricted \n2  observations by members of the opposite sex [were] so degrading as to require intervention by this \n3  court” and ultimately found there was no Fourteenth Amendment violation.  Id.  Similarly, in \n4  Michenfelder, the Ninth Circuit considered a challenge to frequent, routine, cross-gender strip \n5  searches on the grounds they were unreasonable and violated the inmates’ right to privacy because \n6  they were conducted in the company of female deputies.  860 F.2d at 333.  In that case, although \n7  the female officers did not perform the non-emergent searches, they were stationed in positions \n8  controlling cell doors and monitoring the tiers via a video screen.  Id. at 330.  By virtue of their \n9  surveillance responsibilities, female officers could have, at most, an “indistinct, limited view” of \n10  the inmates through small windows in the cell doors or by watching the video monitors.  The court \n11  held that strip searches that involve infrequent or casual observation by members of the opposite \n12  gender, or where opposite gender observation is from a distance, do not unreasonably infringe \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  upon the inmates’ right to privacy.  Id. at 334.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    So too the Court finds here that the undisputed evidence indicates that male deputies were \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  in a position to have only infrequent or casual observation of the inmates at CJ2 while the female \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  officers performed strip searches.  This, under binding Ninth Circuit precedent, is insufficient as a \nS d nr\nee 17  matter of law to constitute an infringement of the inmates’ Fourteenth Amendment rights.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Controlling precedent does not require that all opposite gender guards be removed from the pod \n19  anytime a visual strip search is conducted in the bathrooms or shower stalls.  The Court finds that \n20  a reasonably jury could not find that incidental and casual viewing by the male deputies was so \n21  degrading as to amount to a constitutional violation. \n22    Based on this Court’s finding that the incidental cross-gender viewing during strip searches \n23  conducted at CJ2 pass constitutional muster under existing precedent, the Court similarly finds \n24  that the Monell claim and the Bane Act claims, which depend upon a finding of unconstitutional \n25  treatment, similarly fail.  The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the \n26  cross-gender search claim. \n27   \n28   \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-07659-JSW   Document 114   Filed 12/05/22   Page 10 of 10\n \n1    CONCLUSION \n2    For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment \n3  and DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment regarding the outdoor recreation claim and \n4  GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the cross-gender search claim.  A \n5  separate judgment shall issue and the Clerk is directed to close the file. \n6   \n7    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n8  Dated: December 5, 2022 \n9  ______________________________________ \nJEFFREY S.
